Benjamin Colton Barnes was discharged from the Army for misconduct after being charged with drunken driving and improperly transporting a privately owned weapon

Iraq War veteran Benjamin Colton Barnes was last stationed at a troubled U.S. Army base notorious for suicides and violence, it emerged today.

The 24-year-old, suspected of killing a Mount Rainier National Park ranger after shooting four people in Seattle, was expelled from Joint Base Lewis-McChord in Washington two years ago.

Lewis-McChord has drawn national attention for 
widespread problems with post-traumatic stress disorder among service 
members returning from Afghanistan and from Iraq.

In 2009 Barnes left it after being discharged from the Army for misconduct. He was charged with drunken driving and improperly transporting a privately owned weapon.

Then on Monday the survival expert is believed to have gone on the rampage. He was eventually found dead face down in snow after police launched a manhunt for him.

Police think he fled to the remote park on Sunday to hide after an earlier shooting at a New Year's house party near Seattle that wounded four, two critically

Authorities suspect he shot ranger Margaret Anderson later on Sunday, before freezing to death.

A
year ago, the military newspaper Star and Stripes rated Lewis-McChord 
as the most troubled base in the entire U.S. military, with multiple 
criminal and military investigations under way into troops' behavior and
the quality of the medical and mental health care for service members 
returning from the war.

That
was before the base set a record for presumed suicides in 2011, with 
12, according to military statistics due to be released this month.

Joint Base Lewis-McChord is one of the largest bases in the country, with about 100,000 military and civilian personnel.

The Army directed base officials last
year to focus specifically on the mental health of members of the 5th 
Stryker Brigade, which saw heavy action in Afghanistan in 2009 and 2010.

Barnes served with a Lewis-McChord Stryker brigade, although officials said they didn't immediately know whether it was the 5th.

It follows a series of reports about and incidents at Lewis-McChord.

Lewis-McChord, near Tacoma, 50 miles 
south of Seattle, has seen numerous violent incidents, leading to 
several charges and convictions of soldiers for serious crimes. These include:

In a paper for the Army War College last year, Army Colonel Ricardo Love reported that 'veterans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan are diagnosed with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder at an alarming rate'.

A 2008 RAND Corp. study indicated that 18 per cent of all service members returning from Iraq and Afghanistan since 2001 had 'PTSD or major depression'. Only about half seek treatment, it said.

'Although Commanders are conducting tough and realistic training prior to deployment, the high number of returnees diagnosed with PTSD indicates we are not doing enough,' Love concluded.

But the problem is especially severe at Lewis-McChord, which the Los Angeles Times profiled as 'a base on the brink' just last week.

'I can tell you that in the last two years, we have had 24 instances in which we contacted soldiers who were armed with weapons,' Bret Farrar, police chief in nearby Lakewood, told the newspaper. 'We've had intimidation, stalking with a weapon, aggravated assault, domestic violence, drive-bys.'

The issues have come to widespread public attention after Lewis-McChord's heaviest year of deployments in Iraq and Afghanistan, where 18,000 soldiers from the base served in between 2009 and 2010.

Barnes is known to have had a troubled transition to civilian 
life, with accusations he suffers post-traumatic stress disorder and was 
suicidal.

He was involved in a custody dispute 
in Tacoma July, during which his toddler daughter's mother sought a 
temporary restraining order against him, according to court documents.

In seeking sole custody of the girl, she said Barnes was suicidal and 'gets easily irritated, angry, depressed and frustrated'. Undated photos 
provided by police showed a shirtless, tattooed Barnes brandishing two 
large weapons.

The
woman said Barnes had numerous weapons in his home, including firearms 
and knives, adding: 'I am fearful of what Benjamin is capable of with 
the small arsenal he has in his home and his recent threat of suicide.'

In November 2011, a guardian ad litem
recommended parenting and communication classes for both parents and 
recommending Barnes be allowed to continue supervised visits with the 
child, two days a week.

That visitation schedule was to 
continue until he completed a domestic violence evaluation and mental 
health evaluation and complied with all treatment recommendations.

Late Sunday police named Barnes the suspect in the New Year shooting incident which preceded the murder of the park ranger.

On New Year's Eve, there was an argument 
at a house party in Skyway, south of Seattle, and gunfire erupted, 
police said.

Four people in their 20s were reported injured, two 
critically. Barnes was connected to the shooting, said Sgt Cindi West, 
King County Sheriff's spokeswoman.

It is believed that the man had been 
asked to leave after an argument over a gun. The man came back with a 
weapon and opened fire on the crowd, according to police.

Police believe Barnes headed to the 
remote park wilderness to 'hide out' following the Skyway shooting. 
There were children present in the home at the time of the shooting.

'The speculation is that he may have 
come up here, specifically for that reason, to get away,' parks 
spokesman Kevin Bacher told reporters early Monday. 'The speculation is 
he threw some stuff in the car and headed up here to hide out.'

Mrs Anderson had set up a roadblock 
on Sunday morning to stop a man who had blown through a checkpoint 
rangers use to check if vehicles have tire chains for winter conditions.
A gunman opened fire on her before she was able to exit her vehicle, 
authorities say.

Before fleeing, the gunman fired shots at both Anderson and the ranger that trailed him, but only Anderson was hit.

Mrs Anderson would have been armed, 
as she was one of the rangers tasked with law enforcement, parks 
spokesman Kevin Bacher said. Troyer said she was shot before she had 
even got out of the vehicle.

Park superintendent Randy King said 
Anderson, a 34-year-old mother of two young girls who was married to 
another Rainier ranger, had served as a park ranger for about four 
years.

King said Anderson's husband also was working as a ranger elsewhere in the park at the time of the shooting.

Mrs Anderson graduated from Westfield
High School, New Jersey in 1995 and fulfilled her dream of becoming a 
park ranger, according to local newspaper the Westfield Patch.

She met her husband through work and they married in 2005. The couple had two daughters, Anna, three, and one-year-old Katie.

Adam Norton, a neighbour of 
Anderson's in the small town of Eatonville, Washington, said the 
ranger's family moved in about a year ago.

He said they were not around much, 
but when they were Norton would see Anderson outside with her girls. 
'They just seemed like the perfect family,' he said.

The town of about 3,000 residents, which is a logging community overlooking Mount Rainier, is very close knit, he said.

'It's really sad right now,' Norton said. 'We take care of each other.'

Police have been in contact with 
Barnes' family, trying to have them coax him to 'come to the police and 
tell his side of the story'.

The shooting has meanwhile renewed 
debate about a federal law that made it legal for people to take loaded 
weapons into national parks. The 2010 law made possession of firearms 
subject to state gun laws.

Bill Wade, the outgoing chair of the 
Coalition of National Park Service Retirees, said Congress should be 
regretting its decision.

'The many congressmen and senators 
that voted for the legislation that allowed loaded weapons to be brought
into the parks ought to be feeling pretty bad right now,' said Wade.

Hours: The shooting occurred near the park's Longmire Ranger Station but took responders several hours to reach Margaret Anderson because of shots continually fired by the gunman

Wade called Sunday's fatal shooting a
tragedy that could have been prevented. He hopes Congress will 
reconsider the law that took effect in early 2010, but doubts that will 
happen in today's political climate.

Calls and emails to the National Rifle Association requesting comment were not immediately returned on Monday.

The NRA said media fears of gun 
violence in parks were unlikely to be realised, the NRA wrote in a 
statement about the law after it went into effect. 'The new law affects 
firearms possession, not use,' it said.

The group pushed for the law saying people have a right to defend themselves against park animals and other people.

Bacher, the parks spokesman, said 
surviving overnight in the open on Rainier is difficult, but not 
impossible for a person with gear and skills. He added that authorities 
wouldn't shed tears if Colton didn't survive.

'I don't think any of us would be sorry if he was not in a condition to fire on our searchers this morning,' Bacher said.
