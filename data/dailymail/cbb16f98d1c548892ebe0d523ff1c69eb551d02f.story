I'm surprised that Crystal Palace haven't been charged by the Football Association.

When Palace fans unfurled a banner on Saturday during the game with Chelsea at Selhurst Park, I was shocked.

It read: 'Roman's Dirty Money Is A Disease That Has Plagued Our Game.' Split into two sections, the banner was so large it stretched across 20 to 25 people at least.

That statement is actionable, and if Roman Abramovich was so inclined, he could seek legal advice about whether to pursue those who created the banner and wrote the words through the courts. He could even take action against Palace for allowing the banner to be shown.

There is no way that banner should have been allowed into the ground. Palace should be charged, although leniency should be shown to the club because stewards took it down swiftly.

There is an irony with all this moralising and sermonising among the Selhurst faithful.

Crystal Palace is a club that has hit hard times in the past. So hard that they had to go into administration less than five years ago. Going into administration means they got away with not having to pay all their bills in full.

The players are looked after – when the PFA aren't busy supporting any of their members who are convicted rapists, they make sure all footballers get their wages even when a club is in crisis, and on the brink of extinction.

No, it's the less well-paid employees who won't get paid up, and the small businesses who don't receive money owed to them when a football club sinks into administration. Twenty-nine people were made redundant when Palace took that route in January 2010.

This situation where ordinary working folk lose their jobs or don't get what's owed to them by Palace and other clubs who go into administration, is apparently fine with these pompous high and mighty Eagles fans, who think they have the right to write libellous words on a banner and display it in front of thousands at a public event.

And can they back up their claims?

If they have any evidence of 'dirty money' they should take it to the relevant authorities.

The hypocrisy of a group of fans who ignore their own club's past financial mismanagement and instead make unsubstantiated claims about the owner of another is breathtaking.

Will Palace take any action against the individuals who made and displayed the banner? I hope so.

Steve Parish has always acted and spoken with class and integrity as co-chairman of Palace, I hope he continues to do that and protects the integrity of his Chelsea counterpart.

Palace's financial mismanagement left them in administration in 2010 - businesses were left unpaid and 29 staff were made redundant
