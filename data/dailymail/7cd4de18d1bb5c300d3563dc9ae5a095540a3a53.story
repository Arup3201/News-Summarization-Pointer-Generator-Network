Determined: The mother-of-four pulled no punches in telling a manageress that she was well within her right to nurse her baby at the recreation center in Burleson, Texas, while her eldest daughter was in a dance class

When prudish leisure centre staff told Lucy Eades to stop breastfeeding in public, she had a few more important things to get off her chest.

The mother-of-four pulled no punches in telling a manageress that she was well within her right to nurse her 16-week-old baby at the recreation center in Burleson, Texas, while her eldest daughter was in a dance class.

And in the end the jobsworth was forced to yield and walk away after Mrs Eades correctly pointed out: 'It's the law. I can nurse my child with or without a cover.'

The heated exchange was filmed last week at the Burleson Recreation Centre by Mrs Eades' husband who stood quietly by, seeing his strong-willed wife was more than abreast of the situation.

He later uploaded the footage to the family's YouTube channel, which, by today, had already been viewed by almost 300,000 people, many of whom left staunch messages of support.

The incident began when the female manager at the centre approached Mrs Eades and demanded she cover up for the sake of 'decency'.

'It's like she was waiting on us or saw us for a distance, but as soon as we came in, she told me immediately that I needed to cover up or we needed to leave,' Mrs Eades later told ABC affiliate WFAA. 'I walked up, and was nursing him, just because it's 100 degrees outside, and trying to cover his face and entire body, trying to nurse for such a short period of time -- it's way too hot to do that. It's not fair or realistic.'

The mean-spirited manageress approached Mrs Eades at reception and said: 'I have permission from the city authorities to ask you to cover up.'

The woman then confusingly states that 'it's an issue of decency' before admitting that she didn't think Mrs Eades' actions were indecent.

She continues: 'It's not you. I have permission to ask anybody who walks through the door who's wearing a sports bra or a bathing top to cover up.'

Standing ground: In the end the manageress was forced to walk away defeated after Mrs Eades correctly pointed out, 'It's the law. I can nurse my child with or without a cover'Â 

Mrs Eades replies: 'But there are people in here wearing bathing suits and showing more cleavage and skin than me (and they're not being asked to leave)'.

As the staff member says they are not allowed in the lobby either, Mrs Eades hits back:  'It's the law. I can nurse my child with or without a cover.'

Her husband then steps in to tell the woman: 'Okay, I'm gonna ask you to stop talking to my wife, that's what I'm gonna ask you to do.

'If you want to do something about it, call the cops, tell them to do it. Otherwise, leave me alone.'

Indeed, Texas is one of 45 states that have laws that specifically allow women to breastfeed in any public or private location. It is legal to breastfeed in public in all 50 states.

After the footage went viral and appeared on WFAA, the City of Burleston released a statement. It said: 'The City of Burleson supports breastfeeding and appreciates recognition of National Breastfeeding Week.

'The city also supports the law, which states, "A mother is entitled to breast-feed her baby in any location in which the mother is authorized to be."

'Today, two women were breastfeeding in or near a public entrance to the city's recreation center where we were hosting a camp for youth ages 5 - 13 in addition to other recreation center patrons.

'To be respectful of everyone's rights we asked the women to cover up. There is nothing in the law that prohibits the city from requiring a mother to cover up.

'We also offered a room in an attempt to be more accommodative. The city did not attempt to prohibit breastfeeding and we fully support the freedom of mothers to breastfeed as long as it doesn't infringe on someone else's freedom.'

Mrs Eades added: 'This is normal -- this is what breasts are for. Had [the manageress] not made a scene, no one 
would have known, it was that discreet.

'I mean the law is there for a reason. It's there to 
protect us and we need to make sure we are that voice. We tell them 
that's not okay. We can nurse where we need to.'
