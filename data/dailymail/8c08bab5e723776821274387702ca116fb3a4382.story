Cashpoint skimmer Leonid Rotaru is facing jail after admitting fraud

A Romanian who used a cash machine skimming device to obtain 9,000 PINs was facing jail yesterday.

Leonid Rotaru, 32, was caught red handed as he returned to collect a card reader from an ATM he had tampered with.

Police raided his home and found details of 9,000 bank cards on his home computer which could potentially have allowed him to steal as much as £3.25million.

Barry Douglas, of Avon and Somerset police Economic Crime Unit, said Rotaru was part of a well-organised criminal enterprise.

‘You can tell from the quality of the equipment that was attached to the ATM, you can tell from the amount of detail that was found on the computer,’ he said.

‘This was well organised, well orchestrated and with good criminal connections.’

Rotaru used a highly sophisticated card reader which fitted over the entry slot of ATM machines.

Users would unwittingly pass their card through the device, which would record the details stamped on it.

A tiny pinhole camera would then film the victim entering their PIN.

Mr Douglas said: ‘It fits over the card slot on an ATM and as the card goes in it will read your details off the card.

‘The camera will see you put your pin in. It will see your finger strokes and it will know which card it goes with.’

Rotaru's device included a tiny hidden pinhole camera which would film each person's PIN number, after he was arrested police found the details of 9,000 bank cards on his home computer

Officers reviewed CCTV footage and 
spotted Rotaru fitting the device to the ATM. He was arrested when he 
returned later in the day to retrieve it.

Mr Douglas added: ‘By irony, or total
coincidence, the guy was coming back, we think, to remove the device. 
The arresting constable had already seen the CCTV of him fitting it 
earlier in the day, recognised the person and he was arrested.’

Rotaru, a Romanian national living in
Bridgwater, Somerset, pleaded guilty to four counts of fraud and the 
possession of various skimming devices in a hearing at Taunton Crown 
Court.

He was on the run from another police force over similar offences when he was caught.

Judge David Ticehurst remanded him in custody and said all options would be open for sentencing.

Police estimate that banks lose on average £460 per card in such skimming frauds.

Police were called to a cash machine 
outside a Tesco store in Minehead, Somerset, after customers reported 
their suspicions about the device.

The tricks used to steal money from bank accounts are sophisticated, varied and widely used.

Skimming is just one type of this fraud, it is when a card’s magnetic stripe data is electronically copied by a criminal.

Fraudsters skim cards using a device that is fitted to a cash machine or to a chip and PIN machine in shops or stores.

This data is then transferred onto a fake magnetic stripe card and used overseas in countries that have not yet rolled out chip and PIN.

The number of counterfeit card fraud losses (which includes those perpetrated by skimming) on UK-issued cards in the UK has actually fallen in the last two years, according to Financial Fraud Action UK.

In 2010, this type of crime was worth £47.6million, but in 2011 it had dropped to £36.1million.

This drop has been attributed to the increased number of foreign countries who have introduced chip and PIN technology, which makes it much harder to use fake UK cards overseas.

The tricks used to steal money from bank accounts are sophisticated, varied and widely used. Here is how they have developed:

Spring traps: Once a card has been inserted, these prevent it from being returned to the customer and stop the ATM from retracting it.

Cash traps: Claw-like implements are inserted into cash-dispensing slot to 'capture or skim some of the dispensed bills'.

Jammers: An oversized fork-like device is jammed into the cash dispenser slot to keep it open following a normal ATM transaction.

Skimmers: Thieves
lift the data from cards through handheld skimmers or via magnetic 
strip readers. The data can then be re-encoded on to blank cards and 
used at ATM along with victim’s PIN to withdraw cash.

He was already on the run from the police in the UK for similar offences when he was caught
