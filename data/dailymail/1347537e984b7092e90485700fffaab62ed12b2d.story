A Virginia mom has come to believe the ghost of a US Marine who was killed over 30 years ago in a terror attack is somehow now possessing her four-year-old son.

Michele Lucas of Virginia Beach claims her son Andrew has been recalling the story of Sgt. Val Lewis, a soldier who died in the 1983 Beirut barracks bombing.

Lucas told WTKR-TV it started when the toddler began talking about things no child his age should, beginning with saying he used to live at 860 Main Street in Sumter, Georgia.

Lucas began researching herself but couldn't work out what Andrew was talking to, however the behavior only increased.

Spirit within: Andrew Lucas, of Virginia Beach, is being haunted by the spirit of a fallen U.S. Marine, according to his mom. The four-year-old has been reliving the soldier's death

Scared: Michele Lucas says she's searching for answers for her son's strange behavior, including asking her why she let him die in a fire

Connected?: Sgt. Val Lewis (left) died in the Beirut barracks bombing in October 1983. Virginia Beach boy Andrew Lucas has been recounting details of the Marine's death recently, his mother claims

She started suspecting there was a spirit living inside her son, she told WTKR, and reached out to the creators of television show Ghost Inside My Child.

'He just starts crying hysterically and I say “What’s wrong Andrew?” and he says, “Why did you let me die in that fire?' Lucas told the station.

The show producers investigated further and apparently connected the things Andrew was saying with the story of Sgt. Lewis, using the address and the fire.

The Beirut barrack bombings killed over 300 people, including 241 American servicemen - among them Sgt. Lewis - during the Lebanese Civil War.

They showed the boy pictures of Sgt. Lewis and some of his Marine friends, who Andrew seemed to recognize and was able to talk about.

Closure: Andrew's parents believed taking him to visit the grave site of Sgt. Lewis may help him find closure, however they say his behavior was just as strange

Lucas decided to take her son to the Georgia gravesite of Sgt. Lewis in the hope it might bring him some closure.

She said he walked straight up to the headstone and placed flowers atop of it, before taking off for another grave nearby, which he said was one of his friends.

The strange occurrences continued when the family returned to Virginia Beach.

'About two weeks ago, there was an emblem on my wall and it was like somebody went up to it and turned it, and it went right back,' Lucas told WTKR.

Scene: Michele Lucas is now wondering if her Virginia Beach house is haunted

Odd: The toddler's behavior has been frightening his mother, who suspects something supernatural

'So it’s kind of creeping me out. 

'I don’t know if I’ve picked up spirits while I was in the graveyard. 

'I don’t know.'

Lucas said her next step is to see a psychic, hoping they will able to give her better answers.

'Is my house haunted? Is my child haunted?' she said.

'I don’t know.'
