Gary Neville took Wayne Rooney to one side for a five minute pep talk after England's final training session on Wednesday night.

Rooney was last off the field again after he went through a series of dead ball drills at the end of England's short session at the Arena São Paulo.

Before heading down the tunnel, he was stopped by Neville for what appeared to be an intense conversation for about five minutes which involved the England coach miming a few body swerves.

Pep talk: Gary Neville spoke with Wayne Rooney for five minutes after training

The Manchester United striker listened intently and nodded in understanding. He has scored 39 international goals but is still waiting for his first in a World Cup tournament.

Rooney is expected to start in his favoured No 10 role against Uruguay on Thursday night and is determined to enjoy this World Cup.

He has yet to score in the tournament but is determined to succeed.

Neville made a number of tactical observations when Rooney, again the last player off the pitch, spoke with him.

Neville is convinced Rooney can crack it at this World Cup and the country need a performance from him in this tricky fixture.

Gearing up: Rooney stayed late at training on Wednesday to prepare for Uruguay

Asked on Wednesday night about the pressure on Rooney, England boss Roy Hodgson said: 'I am more than satisfied with Rooney's performance with Italy. It's interesting to see he ran more than any other England player, more sprints than any other England player.

'But Wayne, like Steven, and Frank Lampard who hasn't featured yet... they are the players with 100 caps, or 90-odd caps, with World Cups and European experience, so the focus is on them. You can't expect the younger players to shoulder that heavy part of the burden.

'Wayne is more than happy to do that. If he plays tomorrow night, you'll see that in his performance.'
