Calling for calm: United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon has urged Britain and Argentina to avoid exacerbating the row over the Falkland islands

The head of the United Nations has called on Britain and Argentina to avoid any escalation of the row over the Falkland islands.

Ban Ki-Moon made the plea as Buenos Aires told the UN that Britain had turned the dispute ‘nuclear’.

The claim, probably based on reports that the Royal Navy is sending a nuclear-powered submarine to the South Atlantic, shows that Argentine president Cristina Kirchner is trying to stir up international outrage.

Her foreign minister, Hector Timerman, delivered his country’s official protest at Britain’s ‘militarisation’ of the seas around the Falkands to Secretary General Ban and the presidents of the Security Council and the General Assembly at the organisation’s headquarters in New York yesterday afternoon.

Bob Stewart, a Tory MP who was Britain’s commander in Bosnia, said: ‘It’s got b****r all to do with the Argentinians.

‘The Falkland Islands are British and they will remain so. We are not nuclearising the South Atlantic. One of the reasons we are sending warships is because it is routine.

‘But the other reason is that we keep hearing all this rhetoric from Argentina. If they keep it up we might have to send a few more.’

Patrick Mercer, another Tory MP and a former infantry commander, said: ‘The Argentinians need to understand that the Falkland Islands belong to Her Majesty and Her Majesty will do as she pleases with her ships.’

Claims: Argentine president Cristina Kirchner has accused Britain of introducing nuclear weapons into the Falklands

Britain’s ambassador to the UN, Mark Lyall-Grant, is expected to protest to the international body about the behaviour of the Kirchner government, and to point out that the deployment of warships and Prince William is entirely ‘routine’ and has ‘nothing to do with escalating our military posture’.

He will point out that the UN committee to which Argentina has complained is the same body that enshrines the right of self-determination in international law – the very principle that justifies Britain’s ownership of the islands.

Argentina claims Britain has violated around 40 UN resolutions which call for dialogue with Argentina to 'peacefully resolve the conflict initiated in 1833 with the military invasion of the Falkland Islands'.

Mr Timerman later met UN delegates from Colombia and Guatemala, both temporary members of the Security Council, in a bid to play on Latin American solidarity in support of Argentina’s claim.

The Argentine mission came only a day after Mrs Kirchner attacked Britain’s decision to send the Duke of Cambridge and one of its most modern destroyers to the Falklands region.

Speaking from her official home in Buenos Aires, she said Mr Timerman would making a 'presentation to the United Nations on the militarization and also the introduction of nuclear weapons in the area around the Falklands'.

Angry: Penguin News has enraged Argentina by calling its leader a 'bitch' on its website, by using the insult as a file name on a photograph of her

Chileans
living in the Falklands have protested over fears Argentina will 
pressure its neighbour into axing their only air link with their 
homeland.

They waved 
Union Jacks and Chilean flags as they urged Chile president Sebastian 
Pinera to resist any moves to suspend the weekly flight between the 
capital Santiago and the Falklands.

The LAN flight uses Argentina's airspace and makes a stop-off in the Argentine city of Rio Gallegos.

Buenos
Aires has insisted it has no intention of scuppering the flight but its
claims have failed to calm the fears of the hundreds of south Americans
living in the Falklands.

Chile was a key ally of Britain during the 1982 Falklands War but has since switched its allegiance to Argentina.

Protest spokesman Antoine Daille, said: 'We are upset with Chile because Pinera supported Argentina. We feel hurt.

'All
the Chileans living here are upset with him because he forgot us. We 
don't support the Argentines, we support the people of the Falkland 
Islands.'

Argentine newspapers quickly picked up on her claims about nuclear weapons without challenging them.

But there was also speculation that she may, either intentionally or by mistake, have made a 'slip of the tongue'.

The Royal Navy has reportedly sent a submarine to the Falklands, believed to be either HMS Tireless or HMS Turbulent. Both are powered by nuclear reactors but it is unlikely they are carrying nuclear warheads.

With little success, Mrs Kirchner has been trying for year to drum up pressure on the UN that might force Britain to sit down for talks on the Falklands’ future.

Echoing the stance of previous prime ministers, David Cameron has said sovereignty will only ever be decided by the islanders, who remain wholeheartedly determined to live under the British flag.

With her continual resurrection of Argentina’s emotive claim to Las Malvinas, Mrs Kirchner has become the bête noire of Falklands islanders.

In an apparent accidental slip-up that prompted protests from hundreds of Argentines, the website of the Penguin News – the local Falklands newspaper – this week ran a photo of Mrs Kirchner which it titled 'bitch'.
