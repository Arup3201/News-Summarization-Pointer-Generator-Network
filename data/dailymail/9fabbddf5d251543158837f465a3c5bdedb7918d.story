At least 15 Republicans are contemplating US presidential runs, and most of them will be wooing donors and seeking blessings of core conservatives this weekend at two crucial events laying groundwork for 2016.

None of the candidates in waiting has officially launched a White House bid, and the first state-wide vote in the process to determine a party's nominee is a full 53 weeks away.

But the competition to earn the imprimatur of conservative groups, far-right voters, and the mega-donors that have become indispensable to American political success breaks into the open Saturday and Sunday.

KING(MAKER): Iowa Republican Rep. Steve King put together the Freedom Summit to give conservatives in the GOP a chance to catch fire and gain presidential momentum

Candidates charge out of the gate first in the heartland of Iowa, where anti-immigration congressman Steve King hosts the Iowa Freedom Summit.

Of Saturday's speakers, no fewer than eight are believed to have their eyes on the White House.

They include Senator Ted Cruz, a thorn in the party establishment's side; former Texas governor Rick Perry, whose 2012 presidential campaign crashed and burned; New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, battling sinking poll numbers; and mild-tempered neurosurgeon Ben Carson, a Tea Party favorite.

Each will get 20 minutes to wow the 1,000-strong crowd -- a sort of political speed-dating session -- and experts say making a good impression at the start of the political cycle is crucial.

'It is the kickoff, (and) will set the tone for many of the contenders,' Iowa State University professor Steffen Schmidt told AFP.

An equally if not more influential event takes place Sunday in Palm Springs, California, where billionaire industrialists and political powerbrokers Charles and David Koch invited 450 conservative entrepreneurs and donors to their annual winter retreat.

Several 2016 hopefuls will attend, including Republican senators Cruz, Rand Paul and Marco Rubio, who are scheduled to square off in a three-way forum Sunday.

But notably absent in Iowa are former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, 2012 GOP nominee Mitt Romney and Sen. Rand Paul.

Bush, the son and brother of two presidents, and Romney, a two-time candidate himself are viewed as establishment Republicans, occupying the political space more to the middle than those headed to Iowa or California.

On Thursday, Bush and Romney met privately in Utah, in a possible sign of their future intentions.

The Koch network marshals vast funding to advance free-market policies. For many GOP candidates, being on the right side of that network is essential.

'Whether we like it or not, one of the first primaries in either party is the fundraising primary, and having access to that network helps you,' Republican strategist Greg Mueller told The New York Times.

The retreat is invitation-only. But this year, organizers have taken a new tack, and a webcast will be made available to reporters.

No compromise: Senator Ted Cruz is a tea party favorite and promises to wow Iowa conservatives with a small-government message that takes President Barack Obama head-on

'Oops' part deux? Texas Governor Rick Perry is trying to recover from a crash-and-burn 2012 candidacy and may try again in 2016

'Our goal in 2015 is to help inform the national debate around key domestic economic issues, and this forum is the beginning of that conversation,' said Freedom Partners spokesman James Davis.

The Koch brothers' political influence has become profound. One organization in the Koch network, Americans For Prosperity, spent a reported $120 million in 2012 opposing Obama and congressional Democrats.

Such is the Democratic antipathy for the Kochs that when Senate Republican leaders limited debate in the chamber Thursday night, opponents accused them of rushing proceedings to give lawmakers time to get to the retreat.

'Jet fumes have a whiff of Koch,' sneered senior Senate Democratic aide Adam Jentleson.

Democrats too have their deep-pocketed donors, which the party's 2016 hopefuls will court.

But with all eyes on Hillary Clinton as the prospective frontrunner, the scramble for Democratic donor backing is less frantic than on the Republican side.
