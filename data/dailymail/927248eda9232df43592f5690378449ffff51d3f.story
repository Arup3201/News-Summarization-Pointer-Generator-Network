Ready to make her case: The Apprentice winner Stella English arrives at The East London Employment Tribunal for a hearing in which she accuses Lord Sugar of constructive dismissal

Sparks – and four-letter words – flew yesterday as The Apprentice clashed with her former master.

Stella English accused Lord Sugar of subjecting her to extraordinary foul-mouthed tirades when she worked for him as her prize for winning the BBC1 reality show.

The business tycoon hit back, calling the 34-year-old mother of two ‘suspicious’, ‘cold’ and prone to ‘some very odd conspiracy theories’.

The clash occurred during a bitter tribunal battle over Miss English’s failure to keep the £100,000-a-year job she won.

She claimed that when she left, he told her ‘I don’t give a s***’ and accused the 65-year-old peer of treating her life like a ‘game show’.

During a break in her evidence she burst into tears.

Lord Sugar repeatedly shook his head during her evidence and interjected with muttered disagreements.

The multi-millionaire, famed for his confrontational boardroom style, remained composed as he read a statement but made no efforts to hide his fury at his former employee.

Miss English, 34, is suing Lord Sugar for constructive dismissal after he refused to renew her one-year contract in his business empire.

She had been awarded a job with his IT subsidiary Viglen in January 2011 after winning the sixth series of The Apprentice.

But she left the company that May, complaining that bosses treated her like an ‘overpaid lackey’.

Lord Sugar offered Miss English a new role with YouView, his internet set-top box conglomerate.

She claims she felt ‘under pressure’ to accept when he demanded an answer within the hour so he could fend off impending reports in the Daily Mail about her disagreements with Viglen bosses.

Denial: Lord Sugar (right) has denied the claims and instead said Miss English (left) was an 'untrusting and suspicious person' who was full of 'conspiracy theories'

She said: ‘I was under pressure in 
the sense that the Daily Mail had been in touch with Lord Sugar and said
they were going to run a story that there had been a big fall-out. Lord
Sugar wanted an answer quickly.

‘He
stipulated a point in time he needed an answer by... so he could get 
back to them and say their story was false.’ She left YouView in 
September that year.

Miss 
English told the East London tribunal that junior staff members had been
ordered not to follow her instructions, and claimed: ‘Colleagues would 
go silent when I walked into a room.’ 

She
said she tried to raise her concerns with Lord Sugar in several 
meetings, telling him he was wasting his money on her salary as she did 
not have enough work.

He was unsupportive and told her he only gave her the YouView role to protect his public image and that of the BBC, she claimed.

‘He
said to me: “Look if you think Lord Sugar is s****ing himself and 
that’s why you’re here, that’s where you’re mistaken. I don’t give a 
s***. I’ve met my obligations to you. I did it for the BBC and the 
integrity of the show and a bit of my own PR and a bit of yours too. But
the fact is that I don’t give a s***.”

Big gamble: Miss English, 34, (right) gave up a high-flying career in the City when she was named as a semi-finalist on series six of the hit BBC1 show starring Lord Sugar (pictured, left, arriving at the tribunal)

'Yes, I went on a reality TV show. But by then I had thought we were living in the real world, not in a game show.’

Lord Sugar flatly denied many of Miss English’s claims. 

‘She
never said “I’m an overpaid lackey”, “You are wasting your money”, “I’m
the butt of everyone’s jokes”. That is a figment of her imagination,’ 
he said.

Miss English had claimed he relayed negative feedback from a senior manager, saying: ‘Nice girl, doesn’t do much.’

But
Lord Sugar said: ‘I deny saying to her that the feedback was “Nice 
girl, doesn’t do much”. This is typical of her suspicious nature. In 
fact what I said was the feedback was “Nice girl, but she has got a lot 
to learn.”

Testing relationship: Ms English had to carry out a four-month probationary period before she was eventually named the winner of the show in December 2010

‘She was a very 
untrusting and suspicious person. She believed everyone was out to trick
her. She came across as very reserved, detached, and some might say 
cold. She would come to me with some very odd conspiracy theories.’

Last
year the Daily Mail revealed that Miss English’s fiancé Ray Dewar had 
links to gangster Clifford Norris, the father of Stephen Lawrence’s 
killer David Norris.

Lord Sugar said one of her ’conspiracy theories’ was that this was a deliberate leak. He said Miss English did not work as hard as he had hoped.

‘I
began to wonder whether the idea of work rather than the glamour of 
showbusiness was beginning to bite with her. She was earning a lot more 
than many of her colleagues. People were bound to be a bit resentful but
it was up to her to earn their respect.’

The tribunal continues.
