Close: Dennis Langsford, with his daughter Ruth, had Alzheimer's for 17 years of his life

When we can’t put a name to a familiar face, or we lose our keys, most of us will see it as nothing more than a minor irritation.

But for Ruth Langsford, seemingly trivial moments of forgetfulness bear a sinister warning of the illness that killed her beloved father.

After watching Dennis Langsford battle Alzheimer’s for 17 years before his death aged 85 in February last year, she is terrified of following in his footsteps.

The ITV1 This Morning host has described how the pain of watching her father ‘lose his identity’ to dementia was too much to bear – and she would be devastated if the same thing happened to her or her husband, Sky News reader Eamonn Holmes.

The 53-year-old has spoken of her fears for the first time to help raise awareness of the Alzheimer’s Society’s helpline, which will be under pressure from increased demand during the festive season.

She said: ‘I saw the detrition of my father and it is something which worries me. I worry that I have dementia in the family and one day I may get it.

‘I mean, every time you mislay your car keys or struggle to remember somebody’s name, you think, “Oh my God, here we go”. Me, my mum and my sister joke about it but obviously it is in the back of our minds and it is a worry. Deep down there is always that fear.

‘I think the thing I fear most about dementia is losing my dignity and people not understanding you.

‘I hope it never happens to me and 
Eamonn. When I saw my parents, they had been married many years, and mum
 started to believe he didn’t recognise her.

Love: Ruth and her husband Eamonn Holmes have an 11-year-old son called Jack

‘It absolutely broke my heart to see that and I would hope it never happens to us for that reason alone.’

However, Miss Langsford said she still doesn’t believe in using technology to find out if she’s at risk of developing the disease.

‘I believe there are blood tests that you can undergo to find out if you are going to get it but I don’t think I would want to know,’ said Miss Langsford, who has an 11-year-old son called Jack with Holmes, 54.

‘Because I know the illness can’t be cured, I know there is no happy ending and why would you want to know when there is no preventative? It isn’t like there is someone to say if you drink this syrup every day then you won’t get Alzheimer’s, so I don’t see the point in being told now.

Fear: Ruth, who hosts This Morning with her husband, says she doesn't want to know what lies ahead

‘I know what my life would be, and it is enough to have seen someone go through it than to be burdened with the knowledge it is going to happen to you too.’

The Alzheimer’s Society’s national dementia helpline receives 38,000 calls annually, with a higher volume during Christmas when families are reunited.

Miss Langsford is also helping the Dementia Friends campaign, which provides support to carers and the families of sufferers.

The scheme helps to teach patients’ loved-ones how to communicate with them and explains the effects of the illness.

For confidential advice, information and support, call Alzheimer's Society's National Dementia Helpline on 0300 222 11 22. The service is open Monday to Friday and at weekends, with trained advisers who understand the needs of people affected by dementia. You can also email enquiries to helpline@alzheimers.org.uk
