A wheelchair fisherman was abandoned in the middle of a frozen river after his friend saw police and ran off - because he thought they were breaking the law. 

Passers-by in St. Petersburg, north-western Russia, raised the alarm after spotting disabled Egor Fokine, 38, and his friend Boris Kovalev, 40, on the River Neva dipping their fishing lines into holes they had made in the ice.

Eyewitness Samson Ozerov, 45, said: 'I saw this man wheeling his buddy out to the middle of the river and realised they could be in real danger as the ice is very thin out there.

The one that got away: Boris Kovalev (left) sprinted off when he saw river police arriving - and left wheelchair-bound Egor Fokine (right) stuck on the ice

Stranded: Egor Fokine was unable to move himself off the ice after his friend had run off fearing they were breaking the law

Rescue mission: Passers-by captured the moment river patrol officers arrived on the scene having been alerted by passers-by

'But I was also worried that if they did actually catch anything, then they could be terribly ill as the water here is very polluted.'

When river patrol officers approached the pair in a hovercraft, Kovalev ran off leaving his wheelchair-bound friend stranded.

Fokine, who was unable to move his wheelchair, told police the pair had been fishing because it was cheaper than buying it in the shops.

Safe and sound: Disabled Fokine was told he was not in trouble and that rescuers simply wanted to lift him from the thin ice he was on

A police spokesman said: 'When we reached the man he was trying to wheel himself off, but the ice was too slippery and he couldn't go anywhere.

'We told him he wasn't in trouble with us as our job was simply to ensure his safety and explained that the ice was so thin it could easily crack and he would then die.

'He said he had gone there because they were both unemployed and wanted to catch some fish because it would be cheaper than buying it in the shops.'
