David Miasik, 45, a pub pest who stalked a barmaid Claire Edwards. Merthyr Tydfil Magistrates Court heard how he picked on the wrong woman, because her other job was as a policewoman

A stalker who fabricated a relationship with a barmaid at his local pub picked on the wrong woman it seems - as her other job was as a policewoman.

David Miasik, of Cwmdare, near Aberdare, South Wales,  was obsessed with part-time barmaid Claire Edwards, bombarding her with 'disturbing' messages begging her to speak to him.

The 45-year-old even told his family they were an item, and when they thought the 'couple' had split up, they contacted her to urge her to get back together with him.

But Merthyr Tydfil Magistrates' court heard that when she quit her job as a barmaid to concentrate on her career as a CID detective constable she reported him to her police bosses.

Magistrates were told that she received Facebook messages from someone calling himself 'Licentious Dave'.

Det Con Edwards said she looked up the meaning of licentious as 'promiscuous and unprincipled in sexual matters'.

The court heard it was from Miasik telling her that he loved her - and begging her to speak to him.

Prosecutor Shelly Hopkins told the court: 'She found the messages to be disturbing.

'He appeared to have a lot of information about her and her life and things of that nature.

'She was very upset at this - she felt vulnerable.

'She thought that if he knew that much information about her he could know her home address.'

The court heard she only knew him as 'Dave' - a regular at the Belle View pub, in Cwmdare, South Wales  - who was 'quiet, awkward and a loner'.

Mrs Hopkins said: 'She was frustrated, concerned and alarmed at his behaviour and did not know where the fixation with her came from.'

Miasik was arrested for harassment after Det Con Edwards reported his behaviour to senior officers.
