Roger Clemens has been cleared of all charges as a jury decided he didn't lie to Congress when he denied using performance-enhancing drugs, closing the book on a five-year saga that had the former pitcher's impressive career clouded by allegations of steroid use.

Jurors returned their verdict Monday after close to 10 hours of deliberation.

The verdict brought an end to a 10-week trial that capped an expensive, five-year probe into one of the greatest pitchers in the history of baseball, who pitched for the Boston Red Sox, Toronto Blue Jays, New York Yankees and Houston Astros in his 24-year career.

Competitor: Clemens was a dominant force on the baseball field in his 24-year career with four major league teams, including the Boston Red Sox and the New York Yankees

Clemens, 49, was accused of 
perjury, making false statements and obstructing Congress when he 
testified at a deposition and at a nationally-televised hearing in 
February 2008.

The charges centered on his repeated denials that he used steroids and human growth hormone during his career.

Outside the courthouse, Clemens thanked his family members and the former teammates for their support during the intense legal battle.

Fighting back tears, the man known as 'The Rocket' again pushed aside claims that he used performance enhancing substances, saying: 'I put a lot of hard work into that career.'

The verdict is the latest blow to the government's pursuit of athletes accused of drug use.

The government's case relied heavily 
on the testimony of Clemens' longtime strength coach, Brian McNamee, who
testified that he injected Clemens with steroids in 1998, 2000 and 2001
and with HGH in 2000.

McNamee produced a needle and other materials he said were from a steroids injection of Clemens in 2001, items that McNamee said he stored in and around a Miller Lite beer can inside a FedEx box for some six years.

But McNamee was the only person to claim firsthand knowledge of Clemens using steroids and HGH, and even prosecutors conceded their star witness was a 'flawed man.'

McNamee was arrested in 2001 for allegedly raping a woman in a Florida hotel pool who was later found to have ingested a date rape drug.

The rape case was one detail that Clemens' lawyers used in their relentless attacks on McNamee's credibility and integrity.

They also pointed out that his story had changed over the years and implied that he conjured up the allegations against Clemens to placate federal investigators.

Some items associated with the beer can 
were found to have Clemens' DNA and steroids, but the defence called the
evidence 'garbage' and claimed it was contaminated or manipulated by 
McNamee, a former New York City police officer.

Dubbed 'The Rocket' during his baseball career, Clemens has been dodging allegations that he had used performance enhancing drugs since his name appeared in the Mitchell Report in 2007.

He was also mentioned in Jose Canseco's book Juiced: Wild Times, Rampant 'Roids, Smash Hits & How Baseball Got Big, where the former slugger accused Clemens of using steroids.

With Clemens' acquittal, the sports world will wait to see the results of the National Baseball Hall of Fame vote, as Clemens will be eligible for induction for the first time.

Other eligible names, including former sluggers Mark McGwire and Rafael Palmeiro, have also had highly impressive careers, but have not received baseball's highest honour due mostly to allegations of drug use.

When Clemens does appear on a hall of fame ballot next year, his name will appear with home run king Barry Bonds, whose record-breaking numbers have also been called into question due to alleged steroid use.

Clemens capped an outstanding career with age-defying performances well into his 40s.

He won a seventh Cy Young Award - the most among any other pitcher - at the age of 41 after going 18-4 in 2004 with the Houston Astros.

In addition, his 4,672 strikeouts rank him 
third all-time.

Clemens
was invited to testify before the House Oversight and Government Reform
Committee in 2008 after he publicly denied accusations made in the 
Mitchell Report on drugs in baseball that he had used steroids and HGH.

He first appeared at a congressional deposition, where he said: 'I never used steroids. Never performance-enhancing steroids.'

He made a similarly categorical denial at a hearing about a week later, appearing alongside McNamee, who stuck to his story.

Later,
committee chairman Henry Waxman, a California Democrat, and ranking 
member Tom Davis, a Republican from Virginia, asked the Justice 
Department to investigate whether Clemens had lied under oath.

In
2010, a grand jury indicted him on the six counts.

Hardin revealed at the time that federal prosecutors made Clemens a 
plea offer but the former pitcher rejected it.
