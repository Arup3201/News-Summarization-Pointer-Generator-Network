The Top Gear team tried to burn their cars as they fled Argentina after being attacked by protesters because it would give the footage 'dramatic effect', it has been claimed.

Jeremy Clarkson and his film crew made a dramatic exit from Argentina this summer after being attacked over a perceived slur on the Falklands war, which the outspoken presenter described as the 'scariest thing I have ever been involved in.'

Now Argentine police have published a report claiming that Clarkson, along with colleagues Richard Hammond and James May, attempted to torch their cars while fleeing for the Chilean border.

The Argentinian ambassador to the UK, Alicia Castro, claims the blaze would have been used 'for dramatic effect' by the BBC. 

Angry locals attacked the TV crew after residents spotted that Clarkson's car had the number plate 'H982 FLK', which was seen to be a reference to the Falklands War of 1982.

In the police report, seen by The Independent, officers document and attack on the presenters as the team drove away from their hotel in the southern ski resort of Tierra del Fuego.

According to the report, a lorry 'started moving towards the road in such a way as to bring about a collision with the Top Gear crew's first vehicle'.

The report says officers, who had mounted an operation to try to get the team out of the country safely, stopped the truck, but a Top Gear cameraman was injured by shattered glass.

Clarkson's Porsche 928, now with the numberplate H1 VAE, escaped unharmed along with Richard Hammond's Lotus Esprit and James May's Ford Mustang.

However, once the trio reached the nearby San Pablo road, they stopped. 

The Top Gear team claim their priority was to abandon the cars and escape, but Argentine police say the presenters tried to set the vehicles alight.

In a letter to the chair of the BBC trust, Ms Castro brands the decision to burn the cars 'alarming and illegal', adding: 'Why would the team possibly want to burn such expensive BBC property?'

The cars were eventually impounded by the police, who then escorted the presenters out Argentina and into Chile via another route.

The fresh allegations were revealed the day after Richard Hammond spoke to chat show host Alan Carr about the attack.

He said the Argentinians had behaved 'like animals' by throwing rocks at their cars and shattering the windows, and had 'scared the c*** out of the crew'.

He also denied that the stunt had been deliberate, saying the crew had only realised the connection when someone pointed it out to them on Twitter.

He added: 'That's when we realised we had to do something about it. 

'That's kind of why we've all got our hands up saying "hang on a minute - the idea that we'd planned that is pretty much impossible and certainly isn't true"'.

'We didn't look at the plates. I've never looked at a number plate that we've used on a car for a special. Not with that kind of cynical outlook.

'You just get the car you want. There were only two of those 928 GTs for sale in the UK at the time - one of which was the one that we got.'

A BBC spokesman said: ‘We absolutely refute the suggestion the Top Gear team intended to set fire to the vehicles.’
