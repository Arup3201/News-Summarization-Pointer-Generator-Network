Pep Guardiola will never be sacked as Bayern Munich head coach according to the Bundesliga champions' chairman.

Karl-Heinz Rummenigge was questioned about whether or not he was worried that many of Bayern's German World Cup-winning stars had yet to return to pre-season training when he made the claim.

German newspaper Welt am Sonntag carried an article on Sunday claiming Guardiola's side could struggle this season due to the tiring World Cup campaign.
