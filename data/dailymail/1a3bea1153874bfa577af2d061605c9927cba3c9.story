Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino has revealed Emmanuel Adebayor could make his first appearance in more than two months against Burnley on Wednesday night.

The Togo striker has not played since the 2-1 home defeat by Stoke on November 9, after which he criticised the club’s supporters.

He returned to Africa on compassionate leave last month amid speculation he had been the victim of witchcraft from his own mother, though sources close to Adebayor insist he returned home to be with a seriously ill family member.

He has not featured since returning to Spurs in mid-December. However, the forward is in line to make his comeback in the FA Cup third-round replay against Burnley at White Hart Lane, with Harry Kane set to be rested. 

Pochettino said: ‘Could Ade play against Burnley? Maybe yes, he is not injured. Maybe I will make changes. We need to analyse who played against Crystal Palace and then see who has a chance.

‘We have played 34 games, more than anyone else. We need to manage our players.’

Burnley boss Sean Dyche has warned English football is in danger of ‘brainwashing’ itself into believing homegrown players are inferior to expensive foreign stars. Dyche was disappointed goals by Scott Arfield and Danny Ings against QPR were not appreciated more, with pundits focusing on poor defending instead.

‘It would be nice to promote the fact that two young British players — new to the Premier League — can score goals like that,’ said Dyche, who has fielded the same all-British line-up in the last seven Premier League games.
