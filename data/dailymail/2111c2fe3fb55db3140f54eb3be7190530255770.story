John Glenn, the former astronaut who became the first American to orbit the Earth, has slammed the U.S. for being unable to take workers to and from its own space station.

The 90-year-old, who circled the Earth three times in five hours on February 20, 1962 and helped lead the nation into space, lambasted the county on the 50th anniversary of his feat.

'It's unseemly to me that here we are, supposedly the world's greatest space-faring nation, and we don't even have a way to get back and forth to our own International Space Station,' he told ABC.

His comments referenced NASA retiring its fleet of space shuttles last year - meaning astronauts have no way of reaching the space station unless they rent a seat on a Russian Soyuz spacecraft.

This will continue until NASA, which hopes private industry will take on the job of taking astronauts to the space station, is able to create its new Space Launch System.

Glenn's criticism came as NASA surprised him with a live chat with the International Space Station while he 
marked 50 years since his historic spaceflight.

He celebrated the anniversary at Ohio State University by kicking off a forum about NASA's future.

The first man to set foot on the moon led the tributes to the first American to orbit the Earth on the 50th anniversary of the feat.

Neil Armstrong was the surprise speaker at an Ohio State University gala honouring John Glenn half a century after Mr Glenn's historic 1962 space flight.

Mr Armstrong said there was a need for leadership in the space programme and Mr Glenn 'literally rose to the occasion'.

Mr Glenn has had his share of accomplishments. But the former astronaut and US senator from Ohio recently said he envies Mr Armstrong and wishes he could have been part of the first manned moon landing in 1969.

Mr Glenn got another surprise earlier
when Nasa enabled him to speak live with crew members from the 
International Space Station.

Commander Don Burbank appeared by 
video link, flanked by two flight engineers floating in the zero-gravity
environment, and said the crew was delighted to help commemorate Mr 
Glenn's momentous trip.

Sitting on stage with NASA Administrator
Charles Bolden, he chatted by video link with three space station crew 
members about space research and the future of the so called ‘final 
frontier’.

Mr Glenn was among the top military test pilots presented in 1959 as the Mercury Seven.

The only other surviving Mercury astronaut is Scott Carpenter, who called out the memorable line:

‘Godspeed John Glenn’ moments before the rocket ignited for Mr Glenn's spaceflight.'

‘Fifty years ago today, Friendship 7 was
orbiting planet Earth, and that helped in a very big way, paved the way
for America to become a space power, and to go to the moon, and to do 
the things that we're doing right now on the International Space 
Station,’ Mr Burbank said.

‘And we hope this also can help set the stage for us down the road to do even greater things.’

Mr Glenn had a light-hearted but educational exchange with the space station crew, asking them about the types and number of experiments on board - more than a hundred, they said - and explaining to his gravity-bound audience of more than 200 people that, for example, a candle burns differently in space than on Earth.

When Mr Bolden asked the astronauts which experiment they'd like to hand off to Glenn if he could join them, Mr Burbank suggested research on the ‘regenerative environmental control systems’ on spacecraft.

Laughing matter: Mr Glenn joked that he thought they would make him clean the toilets on the spaceship

‘That's a fancy word for our toilet,’ flight engineer Don Pettit added.

Mr
Glenn took the humor in stride, replying that being ordered to fix the 
toilet was ‘exactly what I thought I was going to get assigned to’.

Mr Glenn also inquired about how far the space station had travelled during the course of the roughly 15 minutes they'd been talking.

They hadn't kept an eye on the exact distance but said they guessed it was about one-fourth of the way around the Earth.

Mr Bolden joked that Mr Glenn sometimes bugs him about making a trip to the space station. Mr Glenn became the oldest person to fly in space in 1998, at age 77.

He and Annie, his wife of almost seven decades, were scheduled to cap Monday's anniversary by participating in a student-led question-and-answer session during an evening gala featuring a keynote speech by former astronaut Mark Kelly, the commander of the space shuttle Endeavour's final mission and husband of former Congresswoman Gabby Giffords.

Today's talk follows on the heels of a weekend full of anniversary activities. 

Hundreds of NASA workers jammed a space center auditorium on Friday to honor Mr Glenn, and on Saturday, he was joined by Mr Carpenter as they reunited with more than 100 retirees who worked on Project Mercury.

The early 1960s were a magical time in Cape Canaveral and adjoining Cocoa Beach, Carpenter said.

'Everyone was behind us. The whole nation was behind what we were doing,' he said.
