Dying Kelly Murray has one wish before she loses her fight with a rare disease - to smile in a photograph with her sons.

The 33-year-old has lost half her teeth because a cancer-like illness has caused the bones in her mouth to disintegrate.

She was diagnosed with the rare disease langerhan cell histiocytosis, which affects one in one million adults, 12 years ago.

It now threatens to claim her life, before she as a chance to see Bradley, 10, and Louis, nine, grow up.

The condition has caused Ms Murray to lose her teeth as the bones in her mouth to disintegrate. She is pictured with her sons and their father Jason, before her teeth began to fall out

But with the help of kind-hearted friends, Ms Murray is desperate to smile again, so she can enjoy the time she has left with her sons

'I don't like smiling now,' the mother-of-two from New Whittington in Derbyshire said.Â 

'I used to be so confident, but now I never want to pose for pictures with my sons.'

After suffering two collapsed lungs when she was 20, she was diagnosed with the illness.

She went on to become the only person with the illness to carry her own children.

But at the start of last year her condition began to deteriorate. The 33-year-old has been told by doctors, she now has just 12 months to live.

Two of Ms Murray's friends are launching an appeal to raise money so the 33-year-old can have dentures

'I find it hard to accept that I won't see my sons grow up,' she said.

'I want to see them grow into young men. I don't want to miss their first day of secondary school.

'I have always tried to keep on going, but you know your own body, and I know. I can barely lift things.

'Sometimes the pain is so bad and I don't sleep, and if I do I wake up gasping. I'm more tired and I feel weaker.'

Langerhan Cell Hisiocytosis, or LCH, is an extremely rare cancer-like disease that attacks the organs.

It causes pain in the bones, spontaneous fractures, loss of teeth and extreme fatigue as well as weakness, seizures and collapsed lungs.

It can affect a sufferer's memory and affect the pituitary gland, leaving the disease to spread from one organ to another.

Ms Murray has to use an oxygen tank because the disease has cut her lung function by 60 per cent.

Now her friends Karla Wilkinson and Sherralyn Newton want to raise money so Ms Murray can have veneer dentures fitted and be able to smile again.

'It would give me my confidence back, and I could pose for pictures the boys could look at for years to come, even after I'm gone,' she said.

Ms Wilkinson added: 'We're also hoping to get her and the boys a private photo shoot and maybe a holiday so the boys have memories to last along with Kelly's smile.'
