The kingpin of a Sydney drug syndicate has been caught planning a $1million meth deal from behind bars - just months before he was due to be released after 15 years in prison.

Alex Chan, 64, is one of five men charged over the attempted importation of about three kilograms of methamphetamine into Western Australia from Taiwan.

Chan, who was jailed in 1997 on drug offences in connection with the Sing-Ma crime syndicate, was up for parole in just six months.

He was moved to a minimum security work camp at Walpole in recent months, allowed to spend time in the community and given access to mobile phones - an apparent model prisoner.
