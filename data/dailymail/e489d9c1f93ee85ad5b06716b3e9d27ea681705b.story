A 41-year-old man is in a critical condition in hospital after he was shot in the face outside a store in Brooklyn.

Shaun Green was taken to hospital and placed in a medically induced coma following the attack over the weekend.

Footage taken from a security camera shows the moment Mr Green was shot after the suspect walks up to him before taking out a pistol, firing once and running off.

The victim can be seen turning around with his face in his hand, before he too runs from the scene - he was later found nearby and taken to Brookdale University Hospital. 

Police have said they are continuing to search for the gunman following the incident at 8.15pm on Sunday, the New York Daily News has reported.

According to the paper, it was not known why the attack was carried out.

Last month saw hundreds of demonstrates march across the Brooklyn Bridge to call for tougher gun control laws.

The protest was underwritten by former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg - one of the nation's most visible gun control advocates.

About 1,000 activists gathered in downtown Brooklyn before marching across the bridge to City Hall.

Police are on the hunt for the suspect, who is said to be about 6ft 3ins tall, weighing about 230 pounds

They then held a demonstration outside the building's gates during which they chanted 'Not one more'.

The event was run by several groups - including Moms Demand Action, Everytown For Gun Safety and Mayors Against Illegal Guns - which are all bankrolled by the billionaire former mayor. 

Bloomberg, who was not in attendance, has pumped millions of his own money into the anti-gun cause, even after leaving office in December.
