An epilepsy sufferer was left with a fractured skull after a group of teenagers attacked him with a brick in an attempt to make suffer a seizure.

Tony Cartlidge was walking through Northwood Park in Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, when he was set upon earlier this month.

The 23-year-old claims the group had launched a bullying campaign against him in an an attempt to make him suffer a seizure, and said this was the second they had attacked him.

Tony Cartlidge, who has epilepsy, had a brick thrown at his head by a group of teenagers who he claims were trying to make him suffer a seizure

The 23-year-old spent two nights in hospital after the brick struck him on the head leaving him with a nasty gash to his forehead that required stitches

In the latest incident, on August 15, Mr Cartlidge was chased by a man wielding a machete, before being struck on the head with a brick which one of the group had hurled over a fence.

Mr Cartlidge said: 'I felt something hit my head and when I looked down a brick was on the floor.

'There was blood all over me. They want me to have a fit.

'I’m constantly getting called a ‘smackhead’ because I shake on the floor when I have a fit.

'They found out that epileptic people can wet themselves when they have fits and that’s what they’ve been trying to do.'

Mr Cartlidge spent two nights in hospital following the attack. He is constantly reminded of the trauma of the assault every time he puts on his trainers, 'because they're still covered in my blood'.

The unemployed man, who lives in Northwood, Stoke-on-Trent, said he has been targeted by the same group of neighbourhood youths before.

Two weeks ago he said he was hit in the back of the head with a pair of knuckle dusters and challenged to a fight.

Treasurer of the Northwood Residents’ Association, Alan Wrench, said 'it is a surprise to hear about something like this'.  Other local residents called for urgent police action.

Pensioner Madge Morris, 81, said: 'There are people knocking about and I have seen youngsters coming down here late at night when they should be in bed.

'If they are old enough to do the crime, they are old enough to be disciplined.'

Peter Johnson, 80, said: 'I think it is terrible. It makes you wonder what the law is doing about it.

'You wouldn’t expect that to happen round here. I think teenagers now have nothing else to do.'

Staffordshire Police confirmed one man was arrested following the ordeal on suspicion of affray. He has since been bailed as officers continue their investigation.
