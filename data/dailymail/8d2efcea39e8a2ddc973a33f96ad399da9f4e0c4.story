Finland's largest airport will be the first in the world to track passengers' movements in real-time - from the car park to the departure gate.

Dozens of sensors throughout Helsinki Airport will automatically pinpoint the location of mobile phones with wifi setting turned on  - as part of a plan that is drawing criticism from privacy advocates.

The system, which aims to monitor crowds and eliminate bottlenecks at security checkpoints or shopping areas, will send alerts to passengers if their departure times or gates change.

Passengers at Helsinki Airport will soon be monitored by mobile phone if they leave their WiFi turned on 

The international airport, which is operated by state-owned Finavia and accommodates 15 million fliers a year, estimates 60 to 70 per cent of all visitors will leave their wifi turned on once the system is up and running by the end of the year.

Finavia and Walkbase, a Finnish company that developed the technology, insist the system is secure and doesn't store or reveal any personal data belonging to the user or owner of the mobile device.

Tuomas Wuoti, CEO and co-founder of Walkbase, told Bloomberg passengers' details will not be put at risk.

However, privacy watchdogs are not entirely convinced. 

Antti Tikkanen, director of security response at software maker F-Secure, told Bloomberg: 'The fact that my movements are tracked is a scarier thought than someone knowing which websites I visit.'

He added: 'I have a hard time believing location tracking is only left at statistics when the same technology makes so many other things possible.'

Finavia says its system has clear benefits for travellers and will transform Helsinki Airport into a technologically-advanced 'smart airport' thanks to the ability to manage crowds.

The system 
uses nearly 300 small devices, including iBeacons and wifi routers, 
which will discreetly monitor smartphone signals either passively or 
with an app-based opt-in.

About 150 white boxes will collect the unique identifier number, or MAC address, from devices searching for wifi networks.

Retailers inside the airport can use the technology to notify travellers about special offers in their shops

The boxes are designed to scramble the information and forward it to servers.

In addition to detecting crowding and congestion, the technology can be used by the airport's retailers to market their products to visitors.

Customers can opt in to receive messages with special offers from 35 shops and 32 restaurants and cafes.
