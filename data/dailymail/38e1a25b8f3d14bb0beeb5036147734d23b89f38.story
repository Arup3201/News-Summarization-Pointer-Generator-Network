A plague of ‘super rats’ in the Home Counties can be wiped out only with considerably stronger poisons, it was claimed yesterday.

Council experts say the number of mutant rats, which are resistant to conventional poisons, is rising drastically after flooding drove them into homes and created ideal breeding conditions.

West Berkshire Council is asking the Health and Safety Executive to change the rules on how poison is used.

Mutant rodent: The 'super rat' is immune to normal rat poison which has led to a fear that it may be unstoppable in spreading life-threatening diseases to humans and farm animals

Homes in Berkshire, Oxford and 
Hampshire have reported increased numbers of the ‘super-rodent’ which is
resistant to normal poisons and can transmit life-threatening diseases 
to humans and farm animals.

However,
wildlife experts fear that if stronger poisons are allowed to be used 
against the rat-threat it may harm innocent local wildlife.

The ‘super-rats’ population is due to increase further as the recent flooding across many parts of Britain has created ideal breeding conditions.

West Berkshire Council is lobbying the Health and Safety Executive for permission to use powerful rodenticides, brodifacoum and flocoumafen, which are currently limited to indoor use.

Graham Chappell, from Rapid Pest Control in Newbury, who is contracted by West Berkshire Council, said: ‘It’s becoming more of an issue now simply because of the number of rats that are being seen.

‘They’ve also mutated genetically and are bred to be immune to standard poisons.

‘We have to start using different methods such as trapping and gassing, which can be less effective and more costly.’

Close relation: It is hard to distinguish the mutated strain from its cousin - the brown rat - due to their shared genetic makeup and identical appearance

A study by University of Reading’s Rodenticide Resistance Action Group involving testing the tails of hundreds of rats killed in Berkshire and Oxfordshire, found that many of the rodents were resistant to common forms of poison used by local authorities and professional pest controllers, farmers and gamekeepers.

Other EU countries allow  use of brodifacoum and flocoumafen
outside, but attempts to make them available in Britain are likely to 
lead to all-out war with nature lovers who fear owls, hawks and even 
dogs and cats will eat the rodents and ingest the poison.

Head of the study Dr Alan Buckle said: ‘We’re not allowed to use them because the regulatory body is worried about their effects on wildlife.

‘My view is that we need to use the stronger poisons but we need to tell people how to use them carefully. If we can do that we can solve the problem.’

The Health and Safety Executive is currently consulting on a European Union proposal to allow limited outdoor use of certain chemicals in pest control. The results will be published next year.

Dr Buckle found the super rats look like their non-mutant cousins, which makes it even harder to identify them.

He added: ‘All rats tend to carry various diseases. The reason we need to get rid of them is because they transmit diseases from themselves to humans and farm animals. They can be life-threatening.

‘These anticoagulant-resistant rats carry the same diseases as other rats carry but are very difficult to control.’

No harm no f-owl: Wildlife experts are worried that if outdoor usage of brodifacoum and flocoumafen is approved it may harm local wildlife who feed off rats, such as owls

A map was drawn indicating where the rats were found, including areas of farmland around Henley-on-Thames, Caversham and Sonning. Exact locations have not been disclosed.

The survey found the rats to be living in both urban and rural areas. Farm buildings were popular habitats because the rats could live off food for livestock.

Dr Buckle said this caused the greatest concern because the rats carry illnesses such as Weil’s disease, which can be passed on to humans. It has flu-like symptoms initially but can lead to jaundice in the kidneys.

He said ‘If Weil’s disease is not treated it’s very serious. About 40 to 50 people in the UK catch it every year.

‘However, very often people go to the doctor with flu and are given antibiotics and it clears up so there might actually be more cases than we know about'

Dr Buckle is also concerned that wildlife including red kites, barn owls, foxes and badgers could be affected even if ‘ordinary’ poisons are put down - because people will use greater and greater quantities in a vain attempt to destroy the super rats, which can’t be killed.

‘They are called super-rats but they don’t look super - they look just like any other rats.

‘That’s the problem because people don’t know they are resistant and carry on using poisons that can’t control them.

‘We’re concerned that more and more of these poisons are getting into wildlife.

‘If the rats have eaten the poison and stay alive, when other animals eat them, they can get secondary poisoning. It can then get passed up the food chain.

‘There’s no danger to humans in the movement of this poison but there’s enough concern about it getting into wildlife.’
