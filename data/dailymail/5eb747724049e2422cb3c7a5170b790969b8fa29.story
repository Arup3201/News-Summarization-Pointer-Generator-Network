Indonesia's courts have rejected an application for a judicial review into the cases of Australians Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran, who face execution.

Lawyers for the Bali Nine ringleaders on Friday applied for a second judicial review of their case, examining past errors of the law and their transformation over a decade in jail.

Denpasar District Court spokesman Hasoloan Sianturi on Wednesday told reporters the application was rejected.

The spokesman said after considering the documents put forward for a judicial review, known as a PK, neither man's application could be accepted.

'The documents of that PK will not be sent to the Supreme Court,' he told reporters in Bali.

Indonesian authorities have continued planning for the execution of Chan, Sukumaran and others even while the application was before the courts.

It comes after a slight glimmer of hope from the Denpasar District Court chief, Judge Sugeng Riyono, who was yet to make a decision on the matter on Tuesday.

'There is no difficulty. We just have to look at all the regulations, including the Constitutional Court decision, the Supreme Court decree as well as the joint decision that was made in January,' Mr Riyono previously said according to News Corp.

Chan and Sukumaran's lawyer, Julian McMahon, argued that his clients had clearly exhibited that they had been rehabilitated since their sentencing in 2006.

'Anyone who studies the facts in the case of Sukumaran and Chan would immediately know they should not be treated as if they are merely criminals. In fact because of the Indonesian penal system they have become reformed prisoners and valuable contributors helping Indonesia. It simply makes no sense now to kill them,' Mr McMahon told News Corp.

It was revealed on Monday that the Bali Nine pair would be killed by a firing squad in the next round of executions.

The pair, who have been on death row since 2006, could face death at any stage under a crackdown by the Indonesia government on drug cases.

According to Nine News Sukumaran and Chan will be taken in the dead of night from their cells at Kerobokan Prison in Denpasar and flown to Jogjakarta. From there they will take a five-hour journey through the villages of Java before they arrive at the port of Cilicap.

The men will then be taken by boat into restricted waters, where they will get their first glimpse of the notorious correctional centre on Nusa Kambangan.

From there the Australian men will be housed in one of the seven prisons on the island, where they will live out the remainder of their days before they are lined up in front of the executioners. 

Nusa Kambangan is where the Bali bombers faced the firing squad and where six drug criminals were executed two weeks ago.
