The latest victim of the intense heatwave that is crippling the country is the nation's concrete.

There are grave concerns that sidewalks and roads in cities across the U.S. may start exploding under the sweltering and persistent heat, which has claimed the lives of at least 13 people.

The country-wide heat wave coupled with stifling 
humidity intensified in the mid-section of the country today, with 
forecasters warning of at least six more days of 100-plus degree 
temperatures for many areas.

The news came as it emerged over 1000 heat records have been broken in the past month.

Now a Public Works Director is saying that the water and heat on the concrete could cause it to actually explode.

Des Moines Public Works Director Bill Stowe says that water trapped either below the concrete or inside it can actually explode, causing the concrete to break wide open.

This only happens in concrete and not asphalt.

The central US states experiencing temperatures and humidity indices above 37.7C with even worse weather predicted in some areas by Thursday.

Forecasters said high pressure in the upper atmosphere ensured that the 
searing weather would remain in place in the heartland for days on end, 
but would not spare the eastern United States.

The US east coast already on Tuesday was beginning to feel the effects 
of the oppressive weather, which was expected to reach New York, 
Washington DC and the rest of the eastern seaboard full force by 
midweek, according to NOAA.

Pat Slattery, spokesman for the weather service, said: 'This is unusual. There's no sugar coating anything here.'

Temperatures in places such as Dodge City, Kansas, Wichita, Kansas, and Woodward, Oklahoma, were forecast to be above 100 degrees up to and including Sunday.

This heat wave is particularly dangerous because many of the areas under its umbrella are not used to prolonged high temperatures and humidity, according to the weather service.

Cities are opening cooling centres, park districts are offering discounts on pool passes and Chicago Public Schools officials are distributing fans to summer-school classrooms that lack air conditioning.

Residents are encouraged to check on neighbours and family members, especially the elderly or disabled.

Chicago officials opened six cooling centres and hundreds of air-conditioned public buildings - including libraries, park facilities and police stations - and are conducting well-being checks on the elderly and disabled.

The region's hazy, hot and humid conditions weren't expected to ease any time soon, with forecasters expecting temperatures in the upper 90s or low 100s through the rest of the week, pushing the heat index - a combination of heat and humidity - consistently into triple digits.

The main concern is that temperatures are expected to exceed 90 degrees every day through Saturday, said National Weather Service meteorologist Stephen Rodriguez.

'The extended nature of this definitely is going to be significant,' he said.

'When you see day after day of (high) heat index values, it can be exhausting on the body.'

Danger on the roads: Emergency workers on the Belle Isle bridge in Oklahoma City on Monday after the heat caused an expansion joint to buckle

The heat caused parts of roads and bridges to buckle across central Oklahoma.

Two lanes on the Interstate 44 had to be closed for emergency bridge repairs when a steel expansion joint buckled under the heat.

Parts of the joint had risen above the buckled concrete on the Belle Isle bridge and several cars were damaged before emergency crews arrived.

Plus the overnight temperatures are not expected to dip low enough to provide any reprieve.

'The cumulative effects, when it doesn't cool down overnight, is that you get no relief,' Mr Slattery said.

According to the weather service outlook, the central United States from North Dakota to Texas and east to the Carolinas, excluding parts of the Northeast and Southern Florida, will see excessive heat right through to July 29.

In Chicago, Monday was the hottest day in five years with the heat index hitting 105 degrees.

A heat advisory is in effect in Chicago from from 11am to 8pm, with temperatures expected to rise in the mid 90s.

the National Weather Service warned that it expected a heat index of 105 degrees on Wednesday and Thursday as well.

Since 1990, it has been 'quite rare' for the heat index to reach that mark, the weather service said.

'There have only been 31 days where the heat index officially reached 105 degrees at O'Hare International Airport,' the weather service said in a statement.

Two people died when their 35ft sailboat capsized in a storm on Lake Michigan, the Coast Guard said on Monday. 

Six crew members were pulled from the lake by another boat competing in the annual Race to Mackinac.

The midnight storm generated waves up to 6ft and WingNuts, a boat registered out of Saginaw, Michigan, capsized and issued a distress signal.

The victims were WingNuts captain Mark Morley, 51, and Suzanne Bickel, 41, both of Saginaw. Morley had 44 years of sailing experience, including six Mackinac races.

The storm produced torrential rains, high winds, and sheet lightning, Reuters reports.

The 333-mile race from Chicago to Mackinac Island, Michigan, is billed as the world's oldest fresh water race, which began in 1898.

'To find the last hourly observation with a heat index of at least 105 in Chicago, one would have to look back to 6pm on August 2, 2006.

Severe thunderstorms packing large hail and damaging winds could hit northern Illinois and the Chicago area later on Monday.

The chance of thunderstorms and showers is 40 per cent, according to the weather service.

July is typically the hottest month in the area.

About 37 per cent of the nearly 3,000 days in which temperatures reached 90 degrees in Chicago from 1928 through last year were in July, more than any other month, according to data analysed by WGN-TV meteorologists.

And the heat wave by which all other hot spells are measured remains the deadly July 1995 stretch that killed more than 700 area residents.

Forecasters said temperatures this week are unlikely to match those conditions, and no deaths were reported in the current heat wave as of Sunday.

The extreme heat and persistent drought seen in much of Texas is taking its toll on wildlife, with deer, birds and other animals abandoning their young because they are  unable to feed them.

Drought-induced malnutrition is robbing of their ability to produce milk.

Abandoned fawns found all over the Panhandle and South Plains have been brought to the South Plains Wildlife Rehabilitation Center. Ten had been brought to the Lubbock wildlife center by the end of last week.

'With the drought, there is no feed for the mother deer. And if they can't feed, they can't produce milk,' said centre volunteer Gail Barnes.

'They can't feed their babies, so they are leaving them.'

In the St. Louis area of Missouri, even the night air was too stifling for some in the crowd of around 50,000 fans at a U2 concert.

Brian Walsh, deputy St. Louis fire chief, said 136 concert-goers were treated for heat-related issues, with seven ending up in the hospital.

He said most of those cases involved alcohol.
