Missing: Sergeant Louise Gibson, 43, was last seen by members of her family on Thursday

Police were searching for a missing female officer today after she disappeared from her hometown four days ago.

Sergeant Louise Gibson, 43, of Thames Valley Police, was
last seen by members of her family in Great Kingshill, Buckinghamshire, on
Thursday.

She is now at the centre of a huge police hunt - with officers 'increasingly concerned' for her safety.

This afternoon, superintendent Ed McLean said 'significant resources' were being dedicated to finding Mrs Gibson, who has worked for the force for more than 10 years.

'We are continuing to do everything to locate Louise and I urge anyone who might have seen her to get in touch, as we are getting increasingly concerned for her welfare,' he said.

'I can confirm that Louise is a serving police sergeant with Thames Valley Police, stationed at High Wycombe.

'As with any high risk missing person investigation, significant resources are being dedicated to safely locating her.

'Her family is being kept fully updated and is being supported by specially trained officers.

'And Louise, if you see this, I just want to make sure you are safe and well, please contact us.'

Mrs Gibson, who was last seen in the village at around 5.30pm, is white, 5ft 7ins tall, of slim build and has long straight blonde hair.

At the time she disappeared, she was wearing a grey thigh-length jacket with a fur collar, light blue jeans and black boots.

Police said the sergeant also has links to Macclesfield in Cheshire.
