'I'm the boy who cried wolf': David Garrett Jr. says he made a post online that the FBI took as a serious threat against news orgnaizations

A hacking threat against CNN that rose to the FBI attention is actually a hoax, claims a freelance writer from Tennessee who is claiming responsibility for the post. 

David Garrett Jr., from Nashville, says he we the one who posted to the anonymous site 'pastebin' claiming to be Sony hackers the 'Guardians of Peace.' It included the bizarre demand that CNN should turn over anchor Wolf Blitzer. 

It is believed that the FBI issued a Joint Intelligence Bulletin based on that post that warned CNN and other media companies that hack attacks could be in the works.

Mr Garrett, who rights about security issues for Examiner.com, revealed himself on Twitter today after news media organizations, including Daily Mail Online, picked up the story about the FBI warning. 

'My fake pastbin post is being investigated by the FBI. I wrote for CNN to "give us the Wolf" and the FBI is actually taking it as a threat,' he tweeted.

'It was a joke. And to show that no one investigates anything. Everything is rumors. I had no idea it would be taken seriously.'

He says he wrote the post to make the point that pastebin is an unreliable source and that anyone can post anything to the site. 

The Sony Hackers released several messages on the site - as well as links to the documents it pillaged from Sony Pictures.  

In a cryptic message, the poster claims to be the 'GOP' and says: 'The result of investigation by CNN is so excellent that you might have seen what we were doing with your own eyes.'  

'Give us the Wolf': David Garnett now says he made the bizarre demand to prove that his anonymous post to CNN was a joke 

The message was posted on the same forum where the hackers released the hacked Sony documents - an anonymous online forum called pastebin

'We congratulate you success. CNN is the BEST in the world.'

The message ends: 'P.S. You have 24 hours to give us the Wolf.'

Mr Garrett says he is being interviewed by FBI agents.

He also posted several screen grabs that appear to prove he is the pastebin user who made the post. 

In a Joint Intelligence Bulletin sent out to US companies on Christmas Eve, the FBI warned that hackers could begin targeting one news organization - and other media companies that reported on the hack Sony attack.

The US government says that North Korean hackers attacked Sony Pictures and released a trove of emails and personal information of employees as retaliation against the release of 'The Interview.'

The Seth Rogen comedy is about the assassination of Kim Jong-un and depicts his violent death.
