True Evertonians should applaud their former manager David Moyes as he takes his place in the away dug-out at Goodison Park today.

That is what David Weir, Everton’s captain under Moyes when they played Champions League football in 2005, believes.

Realistically, though, Weir knows the old bear pit of a stadium will be at its most raucous and partisan today as they get ready to ‘welcome’ not one but three former Everton icons, who walked out on them to join the detested Manchester United.

Old boys: Wayne Rooney (L) and Marouane Fellaini will also be going back to their former club Everton

If the sound levels will be loud for Moyes, they will be off the scale when Wayne Rooney and Marouane Fellaini walk down the tunnel in red.

Both managers aren’t even bothering to ignore the animosity that will exist. Moyes pointed out that Sir Alex Ferguson used to pull Rooney out of Everton games because of the abuse he got.

Martinez, who beneath his butter-wouldn’t-melt demeanour quite enjoys the jousting, has not helped Fellaini by indicating the £27million Belgian would not be able to get in the current Everton team.

Ouch!

Everton fans have been debating all week whether they should cheer or boo Moyes, weighing up 11 years of good service against the ‘treachery’ of joining United and then trying to take Fellaini and Leighton Baines with him.

The game is important in pure football terms, too. Everton need three points to keep in touch with Arsenal in the race for fourth. Having been hammered by Manchester City and Liverpool, defeat at Goodison will feel like another nail in Moyes’ coffin. The league table currently shows he has taken United from first to seventh.

Amid the bedlam, Weir — a hugely-respected figure at Goodison who played 269 games in eight years and then served on the coaching staff — hopes Moyes’ positive contribution to Everton will not be forgotten.

‘The vast majority of Everton fans are good football people. They understand the game and will appreciate the hard word David put and the legacy he left,’ said Weir.

‘Knowing them, they wouldn’t understand why he left because they love Everton so much. They would be devastated to think he saw Manchester United as a step up. They don’t!

‘Everton is my club and I’d love to think true Evertonians would all applaud David. But if I’m honest, maybe it won’t be that way. I think it will be mixed.’

Weir has himself had a turbulent first season in management, sacked by Sheffield United after just 13 games before celebrating promotion to the Championship with Brentford as their assistant- manager. From experience, he knows just how good Moyes is.

‘First of all, he is a great coach. That is the most important thing, his knowledge of the game and the information he has,’ said Weir.

‘He is really detailed, interested in how other teams to play. His attention to detail is very good. At times, we walked out the tunnel feeling we’d played the game already, we knew what the opposition was going to do.

‘He left no stone unturned, we had video meetings that could go on for an hour. It was all about planning for all eventualities. It was a thoroughness that stood the team in good stead – you just felt prepared.

‘I think United know that and I would expect him to be there in 12 months. He gets to the heart of things quickly.

‘We had a really sticky start under him at Everton and Bill Kenwright was probably under pressure to make a change because the fans weren’t happy.

‘But he stuck with him and I genuinely have no doubt if United do the same, he’ll get it right. His over-riding character trait is single-mindedness. I’ve not seen it to that extent in anyone else.’

For all Weir’s plaudits, Moyes knows he has to show he can win big games as United boss.

Perhaps the most damning statistic of his United reign so far is that the team have managed to win only six points from a possible 33 against the Premier League’s top six.

Staying power: Moyes has awarded Rooney a new contract, despite his falling out with Ferguson

Moyes tried to distance himself from the shadow of Sir Alex Ferguson by awarding Rooney a five-year deal when Ferguson wanted him out. Now, he is going to trust Rooney in a fixture Ferguson sometimes felt was too much for the player. Rooney, a boyhood Everton fan, joined United in 2004 despite once claiming ‘Once a Blue, always a Blue’, has regularly received abuse at Goodison and Ferguson left him out of a game there in 2010.

‘I know Rooney’s relationship with the Everton crowd was something Alex felt at times and took into account,’ said Moyes. ‘But Wayne is a different player now. He’s got maturity, just signed a new contract and is due to go to the World Cup.

‘If ever there was a player ready to play in any game it would be Wayne Rooney, with the age he is, the time of his career, what he is capable of. He is about to be one of England’s leading players in the World Cup and you’ll be expecting him to stand up, so I’ll expect him to stand up and be seen at Goodison on Sunday.’

For the first time, Rooney may have to share the billing as primary hate figure in an opposition shirt – with Everton fans disgruntled by the way Fellaini forced a deadline day move.

Martinez hasn’t made things any easier for the Belgian He thinks he got a good deal by selling Fellaini and signing Republic of Ireland international James McCarthy from Wigan for less than half the price, £12.5million.

Not missed! Roberto Martinez claims that Fellaini would no longer get into his Everton team

Indeed, he doesn’t believe Fellaini would get in his side, who start the day in fifth place, nine points ahead of United despite slipping up in midweek against Crystal Palace.

‘You’re looking at McCarthy, Gareth Barry, Leon Osman —where would Fellaini fit in?’ said Martinez, all good fuel for the Everton faithful waiting to bait their former idol.

‘In football you move on so quickly. I’m just so happy with the squad that we have. It’s incredible to have that mixture of youth and experience. It looks like this side has been playing together for the last five years. It’s so natural.’
