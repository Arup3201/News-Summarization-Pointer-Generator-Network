Robert Freeman is undeniably one of the greatest lost photographers of the modern age, most famous for shooting the first five album covers for the Beatles and the first Pirelli calendar. 

Now, aged 78 and in poor health, it is both himself and his legacy - a historic archive of iconic photographs spanning 60 years - that could be lost forever.

In response to huge public demand, coupled with the love of his family, the serene 1965 photograph ‘John Lennon with Panda’ is today being re-released and available at www.freemanarchive.com as a limited edition A2 or A3 archival C-type metallic print.  

In response to huge public demand, coupled with the love of his family, the serene 1965 photograph 'John Lennon with Panda' is today being re-released to raise funds for its photographer Robert Freeman's care

The exclusive sale organised by his son Dean Freeman will end 15 May 2015, raising vital funds for Robert’s ongoing care as well as the preservation of a body of work that captured the likes of his personal friend, Andy Warhol, Muhammad Ali, Sophia Loren, Marianne Faithful and Jimmy Cliff.

Due to the proud and eccentric nature of a great artist, Robert has refused all family help and this is Dean’s way of maintaining his father’s dignity and saving his priceless archive. 

Due to the proud and eccentric nature of Robert, whose work includes this picture of Andy Warhol called Rome from 1972, he has refused all family help

After graduating from Cambridge in 1959, Freeman became a professional photographer, with assignments for the Sunday Times  and went on to capture pictures like this montage of Jimmy Cliff in 1966

As well as capturing five Beatles album covers and the first-ever Pirelli calendar, Robert's work also includes this grainy shot of Charlton Heston in 1962

All previous reproductions of his work have sold for thousands of pounds so this auction is set to raise a huge sum.

Robert became close to the Beatles at the height of their fame, and it is this mutual intimacy that gave him unprecedented access to capture their lives through a series of beautifully grainy black and white photographs.

Speaking about Robert, Paul McCartney once said: 'Although other people were taking photos of us at the time, I think we all felt that his stuff somehow summed up our own feelings. His photos were among the best ever taken of the Beatles.'

After graduating from Cambridge in 1959, Freeman became a professional photographer, with assignments for the Sunday Times and other magazines. 

As well as musicians, he worked with athletes, including Cassius Clay a.k.a Muhammad Ali, captured in 1964

He also worked with The Beatles in their feature film debut, A Hard Day's Night

One of his assignments was photographing jazz musicians at a London jazz festival, helping him to develop a portfolio including portraits of John Coltrane, Cannonball Adderley, Dizzy Gillespie, Elvin Jones, and Coleman Hawkins. 

These were the photos he sent to Beatles manager, Brian Epstein, in the summer of 1963.

In addition to being the Beatles’ most favoured photographer, Robert directed television and film commercials and two feature films: The Touchables and Secret World.

Dean Freeman, a successful director who has published more than 10 works on various stars and once worked as the Spice Girls' official photographer, said: 'My father is extremely frail, living alone in a small hostel and is in desperate need of care. 

'He can no longer look after his valuable archive of work that is falling into disrepair. All proceeds of our exclusive sale will help him recuperate and preserve his wonderful images and stories. 

'It would be heartbreaking to see this irreplaceable body of work lost to future generations.'
