Three elderly Kenyans who claim  they were tortured under British rule will today demand an apology and damages at the High Court.

The trio say they suffered ‘unspeakable acts of brutality’ in UK-run detention camps during the Mau Mau rebellion between 1952 and 1960.

If they win their case, it could lead to thousands more demanding compensation via no-win no-fee lawyers.

The claimants are expected in a two-week hearing to give moving testimony at the High Court in London. The Foreign Office, which denies liability, said they had left it too late to claim.

Archbishop Desmond Tutu has urged David Cameron to concede the case, accusing the Government of continuing to refuse to deal with ‘these elderly torture victims with the dignity they deserve'.

Jane Mara says she suffered appalling sexual abuse.

Wambugu Nyingi says he was suspended by his feet and beaten unconscious in an incident in which 11 men were clubbed to death.

He claims cold water was poured on his face to stop him breathing.

And Paulo Nzili, 85, is expected to tell the court he was castrated during the atrocities allegedly committed at the hands of British soldiers.

All three were held in detention camps during the 1950s.

The Foreign Office, which denies liability, said the group had left it too late to claim.

Archbishop Tutu adds in his letter: 'It is high time that the British Government showed some magnanimity and compassion.'

A year ago the Kenyans won a historic ruling which took them one step nearer to achieving their goal when Mr Justice McCombe said they had 'arguable cases in law'.

The fresh hearing will focus on the Government's argument that the claims cannot proceed because they have been brought outside the legal time limit - but lawyers for the Kenyans will argue that it is an exceptional case in which the judge should exercise his discretion in their favour.

In his letter to Mr Cameron, Archbishop Tutu accuses the Government of 'relying on legal technicalities in response to allegations of torture of the worst kind'.

The claims are being brought with the support of the Kenya Human Rights Commission and the Kenya government.

Solicitor Martyn Day, senior partner from law firm Leigh Day & Co, said: 'The history of what happened to the Mau Mau in Kenya during the 1950s at the hands of the British is a very sorry and distressing tale.

It is however a tale that has to be told, if we as the British people are to learn from the mistakes of the past.'

He said his firm's clients had been 'waiting for this day for a long time', adding: 'We are pleased for them that at long last they have their chance to give their evidence to the court. Our clients are elderly with likely few years left to live.'

Initially, there were four claimants but one has died since the case was started in 2009.

Mr Day said the claimants wanted an apology and a Mau Mau welfare fund to ensure that they, and their comrades, could live with an element of dignity in their final days.

Opening the case for the Kenyans, Richard Hermer QC said the crux issue was whether a fair trial was still possible.

He argued that the existence of thousands of official records and other sources of primary contemporary documentation meant a fair trial was possible, despite the passage of time and the death of certain witnesses.

He acknowledged the task was going to be painstaking and time-consuming.

He said: 'It is going to take a long time, cost a lot of money and occupy court time.

All that gives rise to notions of proportionality.' But he said it was an important case and the court should not be put off by its complexity.

However the Foreign Office argued the case should be thrown out.

Its QC, Guy Mansfield, said: 'It would be contrary to principle and the balance of fairness to allow this matter to proceed to a trial. There cannot be a fair trial of the issues.' He said that the Foreign Office faced 'irredeemable difficulties' in respect of the availability of witnesses and documents in defending the claim.

Those in senior positions in the Colonial Office, the War Office, the British Army and the Kenyan Colonial Administration would ideally be called as witnesses - but most of them were now dead, he said.

'Without those witnesses, and indeed with the necessarily limited recollections of those who do survive, the very complicated and difficult task of determining the competing factual positions cannot be fairly conducted,' the QC argued.In a written submission, the Foreign Office declared: 'After so long, it is simply impossible.'
