As the opening date of China's most famous and popular attraction draws closer, preparations are under way.

Workers have been busy cutting large ice blocks for the 31st Harbin international ice and snow festival from the frozen Songhua river in Harbin, northeast China's Heilongjiang province.

Next year's event - less than one month away  - will open with a theme 'Happy Ice Snow, Exciting City' on January 5 and is due to close on 28 February 2015.

To kick of proceedings there will be an opening ceremony, fireworks display and a series of theatrical performances as well as ice snow activities in Sun Island, Ice and Snow Amusement World, Zhaolin Park and more venues around the city of Harbin.

The 30th festival, which took place in January 2014, required over 7,000 artists and workers, over 180,000 square metres of ice and 150,000 square metres of snow to create a winter wonderland.

Huge sculptures were made of famous buildings including the Colosseum in Rome and attractions such as ice slides, but next year's event promises to be just as exciting. 

Over 2012 and 2013 the temporary man-made ice spectacle drew a combined 28.5 million visitors so is big business. Harbin is called 'Ice City' and though winters are bitterly cold,  conditions are perfect for the ice festival.
