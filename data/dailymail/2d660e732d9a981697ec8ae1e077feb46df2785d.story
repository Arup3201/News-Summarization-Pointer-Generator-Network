The United States Coast Guard is sending one of the largest ships in its fleet to rescue an Australian fishing boat that is trapped in Antarctic ice.

The Coast Guard dispatched icebreaker Cutter Polar Star to the Antarctic Chieftain's location approximately 900 miles northeast of McMurdo Sound, Antarctica.

The 399-foot Polar Star, which has 150 crew members and its home port in Seattle, Washington, was given the exact coordinates by Rescue Coordination Center New Zealand last night.

The 399-foot Polar Star is one of the most powerful non-nuclear ships in the world. It will battle 35 mph winds, heavy snowfall and break through miles of ice to rescue the Antarctic Chieftain

The 207-foot fishing vessel called for help after it suffered damage to three of its four propeller blades.

The Chieftain has lost its ability to maneuver and is completely stuck in the ice. 

There are 27 crew members aboard the trapped vessel. 

US Coast Guard Vice Adm. Charles Ray said: 'The seas of Antarctica are treacherous and unforgiving.

'This incident is a sobering reminder of the importance of the US icebreaker fleet as we see increased human activity in the polar regions.'

The Polar Star will open a channel through several miles of nine-foot thick (above) ice to reach its destination 

The heavy icebreaker had just completed Operation Deep Freeze when it was sent to rescue the Chieftain

Polar Star Capt. Matthew Walker said he is 'confident' in his ship's ability to reach the Antarctic Chieftain

The  cutter will travel more than 330 miles to reach the Chieftain and is scheduled to reach the boat at approximately 10pm tonight.

To get there on time, the Polar Star will have to battle 35 mph winds, heavy snowfall and break through multiple miles of nine-foot thick ice.

Once the boat is free, a fishing vessel from New Zealand and will escort the Chieftain to the nearest safe harbor.

Capt. Matthew Walker, the Polar Star's commanding officer, said: 'The considerable geographic distances and extreme environmental conditions make this a complex rescue mission.

'However, we're confident in our ability to reach the Antarctic Chieftain and committed to ensuring the safety of life at sea no matter the challenges.'

The heavy icebreaker had just finished its annual mission, Operation Deep Freeze, to break a channel through the sea ice of McMurdo Sound to resupply and refuel the US Antarctic Program's station on Ross Island.

Commissioned in 1976, the Polar Star is one of the largest ships the Coast Guard has and one of the most powerful non-nuclear vessels in the world, according to the Coast Guard's website.
