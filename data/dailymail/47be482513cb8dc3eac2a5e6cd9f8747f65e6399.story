Got a spare $100 million? This is one of the numerous cozy living rooms in Bill Koch's private Aspen retreat that is up for sale

A secluded haven: Nestled in Castle Creek Valley, the property is removed from the activity of Colorado's popular tourist city

The 28-bedroom property, nicknamed The Elk Mountain Lodge, spans 82.6 acres, with multiple cabins overlooking 'trout-soaked ponds'

The four main cabins were originally built to be used as a bed and breakfast or wedding party venue but Bill Koch snapped it up

Extras: For skiers who don't want to spend every day on the slopes, Koch has installed a fitness center on the grounds

Idyllic: Each room in the furnished property is lined with rustic wooden panels and plush white sheets

Not one to scrimp on luxury, the older sibling of the renowned Koch Brothers has also invested an indoor basketball court, humidity-controlled wine room, and numerous spas that are dotted about the retreat.

Located in Castle Creek Valley, the property is 1.5 miles from one of Colorado's top cross-country ski routes, Ashcroft Ski Touring, and Pine Creek Cookhouse, a luxurious and renowned mountain-top restaurant.

It comes with 25 bathrooms, and entertainment hall, and a heated four-car garage, according to Zillow.

Homely: State-of-the-art kitchen equipment has been installed in the original, historic building

Enclosed structure: This image (left) of one of the 25 bathrooms displays the slanted ceilings, and the hallway (right) has paneled ceilings

This is the living room of one of the buildings dubbed The American Lakes Cabin, complete with a star spangled banner by the fire

This is one of the few half-bathrooms, which plays to its size with an equally small window that offers a glimpse of the woods outside

As well as guest cabins, there is a caretaker's cabin that is equally luxurious, according to the realtor 

The would-be buyers will get the property completes with the high quality, often antique, furniture Koch bought for each cabin

With a more modern feel, this cabin caters to the working skier, with a TV for news and a desk for a computer

Eclectic: Not one to lie low, Koch has decked out one of the more traditional cabins (pictured) with a shiny latex maroon couch

The owners or leasers can drive 10 miles to downtown Aspen for a bite to eat, or relax in the sunlit wooden kitchen with a bay window seat

The entertainment room: Unlike most celebrity home cinemas, this projection room substitutes seats with a beige velvet chaise longue 

Grand: Koch maintained the traditional structure of this grand cabin and added guns in a nod to the hunting heritage of the region

Dreamy: Through the luscious green trees, owners can glimpse the snowy mountains of Aspen, Colorado

In between skiing, would-be buyers can occupy themselves in the fitness center, tennis court, or hot tub.

According to Forbes, Koch bought the complex, which was intended to be a bed and breakfast or wedding party venue, in 2007. He then spent two years refurbishing.

The furnished property is being marketed as a private resort or business retreat.

Communal: The dining areas are built for a dozen to enjoy a meal or a drink from the humidity-controlled wine cellar

Take a look! There is a telescope poised in front of the vast window to catch a glimpse of the cross-country route nearby
