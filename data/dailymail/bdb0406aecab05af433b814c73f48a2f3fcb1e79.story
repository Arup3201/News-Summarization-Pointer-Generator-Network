Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush once knocked President Bill Clinton as being too 'preoccupied with other matters' to confront Cuba, an email from Bush's time in office that was released today reveals.

In the January 1999 email, obtained and published by the Washington Post along with other correspondence from Bush's eight years in office, Florida's newly elected chief executive took a shot at embattled Clinton over his affair with White House intern Monica Lewinsky and suggested that the next president should be more bold with the communist country.

'Forceful diplomacy can make a difference and we have had none for the last seven years and the current President is preoccupied with other matters,' Bush said in an email to then-Rep. Lincoln Diaz-Balart of Florida.

All in the family: Jeb Bush is pictured here in October on his son George P. Bush's campaign bus during an interview in Abilene, Texas. At the time George was running for Commissioner of Texas's General Land Office, a position he was elected to, and Jeb was merely mulling the presidential run he is now actively exploring

At that time Jeb's older brother, George, was competing in the Republican primary for president but he had not yet beat out fellow contender and Arizona Sen. John McCain for the party's nomination. 

George W. Bush would go on to win the 2000 general election with the help of his brother's home state of Florida. And as predicted by Jeb, he did in fact take a harder line with Cuba than his predecessor Clinton.

When it was Jeb's name on the ballot again, George came to Florida, which boasts the largest Cuban-American population in the country, and promised to veto any legislation proposing to lift the embargo on Cuba and then-President Fidel Castro's regime.

Fast forward 15 years, and now it's Jeb who is in the hot seat over the United States' relationship with Cuba as he considers competing for the presidency himself next year.

A day after Bush said he would 'actively explore' a bid for higher office, President Barack Obama announced a shift in U.S. policy toward Cuba and called for an end on the 53-year-embargo that restricts trade and travel with the country. 

Bush immediately reprimanded Obama, calling the decision to resume high-level diplomatic relations with the country a 'misstep' and 'another dramatic overreach of his executive authority.'

'It undermines America’s credibility and undermines the quest for a free and democratic Cuba,' he said in a statement posted to Facebook.

'Cuba is a dictatorship with a disastrous human rights record, and now President Obama has rewarded those dictators. We should instead be fostering efforts that will truly lead to the fair, legitimate democracy that will ultimately prevail in Cuba.'

At an event hosted by the US Cuba Democracy PAC earlier in the month, before word broke of the Obama administration's secret talks with Cuban President Raul Castro, Bush argued that the embargo, which contains several loopholes, should be tightened, if anything.

'I would argue that instead of lifting the embargo we should consider strengthening it again to put pressure on the Cuban regime,' he said, providing a glimpse of his foreign policy style.

The emails published today by the Washington Post show another side of Bush: a hard-working executive who personally responded to online correspondence directed to him but was wary of leaving behind a permanent trail of unflattering communications.

In one message, dated December 1999, Bush reportedly warned aides that they may not want to have a conversation about vacation time over email it 'might make a newspaper one of these days.

He went on to say, 'I suggest that you guys have a verbal conversation about it rather than create a public document. :)'

In it's review of the emails spanning from 1999 to 2007 the Post says it found that Bush often responded to constituents who emailed him, including one woman who asked him for his wife's birthday. 

Another time Bush directed a staffer to look into a man's plea for help in a personal matter.

'What should have been a messy divorce, seems to have turned into a criminal matter; with me in the middle,' the man wrote, describing two friends' divorce.

Bush couldn't resist responding facetiously to another man who emailed him to complain that 'politicians make me sick, you make me sick.'

To him Bush said, 'I am truly sorry you feel that way. Have a nice day' with a smiley face at the end of the message.

The set of emails, available to the public through Florida's open records act, were set to be released by Bush in the coming weeks as a show of transparency. The Post sped up the process on Wednesday and published excepts of the more meaty messages.

While mostly mundane, the emails obtained and released by the Post did unearth one political liability for Bush: concerns that he isn't conservative enough.

Early in his tenure Bush handled his own hate mail as his administration had not yet created a process to flag and respond to such messages. The recently elected governor passed on at least one angry email to his advisers that characterized his as 'NO CONSERVATIVE.'

That was years before Bush would come out in favor of national educational standards known as Common Core and comprehensive immigration reform, two issues that conservatives have used as a cudgel against him.

Since Bush affirmed his presidential aspirations, current and former aides have come to defense of his record as governor, pointing to his rejection of a high speed rail project of $2 billion in new spending during his tenure and $19 billion in tax cuts.
