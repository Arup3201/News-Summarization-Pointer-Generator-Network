West Ham striker Andy Carroll declared on Twitter on Saturday that he is chomping at the bit to return to Sam Allardyce's squad sooner than later.

And the 25-year-old now has even more reason to be cheerful after it has emerged that he and his long-term partner, former TOWIE star Billi Mucklow, are now engaged.

The pair recently jetted out to Rome on a private jet to celebrate Billi's birthday and while they have not officially confirmed the news themselves, friends have been sending on their congratulations via social media.
