A woman driver who dangerously careered down a busy motorway while five times over the drink drive limit had to be stopped by other motorists who bravely boxed her in and snatched her keys.

Julie Hancock, 47, of Heywood, Lancashire, was driving so erratically that she almost crashed into a lorry and a central reservation while swerving across lanes on the M66 at 60mph.

But despite putting her own life and the lives of others at serious risk - she claimed that she did not 'view' herself as a criminal.

Five times over the limit: Julie Hancock, 47, of Lancashire, was so drunk behind the wheel that other motorists had to stop her during the incident on August 20

She had been heading towards Rawtenstall, near Burnley, in her Ford Fiesta at 5.45pm on August 20 when another driver became aware of the risk and feared Hancock would cause a serious accident.

Thinking quickly, the man, who had been behind her, turned on his hazard lights and then pulled in front of her before putting on his brakes - blocking the road ahead.

Another motorist then also stopped and jumped out of his car, opening Hancock's door and grabbing her keys from the ignition. They then called the police.

When officers arrived and breathalysed Hancock she recorded 162 micrograms of alcohol in 100 millilitres of breath - the legal limit is 35 micrograms.

At the police station, the lower of two more samples showed 142 micrograms, Burnley Magistrates Court heard. 

Hancock later claimed that she did not think she would be over the limit and that she did not view herself as a criminal either.

Erratic: Hancock was swerving across lanes on the M66 near Burnley at 60mph in her Ford Fiesta (pictured) and nearly crashed into a lorry and a central reservation before she was stopped 

But while sentencing her, District Judge Sam Gozee, said: 'Miss Hancock, you are a criminal. This is the second time you have committed a drink driving offence in the past ten years. On the last occasion, it was a high reading. 

'On this occasion, it's off the scale almost. Your driving on that night was dangerous, to say the least. It was so poor that members of the public intervened to stop you driving any further.

'The risk you posed on the M66 that evening, to the public, is really quite alarming. You could have killed yourself and you could have killed many other people. 

'It's clear by the standard of your driving you had no control over that vehicle.

'You didn't think you were over the limit. I cannot accept that. You must have known you were in no fit state to drive. 

'In essence, what you did is take your car as a weapon onto the road. 

'It would be nice if the Chief Constable wrote to the witnesses in this case to recognise what they did on that evening, to prevent something more tragic occurring.'

Hancock admitted driving with excess alcohol on the A682, at Rawtenstall, but was spared immediate jail, after the judge said one of the priorities of the court was to seek to rehabilitate her.

Depressed: Her solicitor told Burnley Magistrates Court that Hancock (right) was depressed following the birthday of her son who died in 2012, aged 17, after sniffing aerosols 

She was given 12 weeks in prison, suspended for a year, with 12 months supervision and must attend the Drink Impaired Drivers' Programme. 

She was also banned for four years and ordered to take a retest at the end of it before she gets her licence back, for public safety.

District Judge Gozee, who said Hancock would be considered a high-risk driver who would be medically assessed by the DVLA, ordered her to pay an £80 victim surcharge and £85 costs.

Hancock's son Danny Collins, 17, a talented rugby player, who had played for Burnley Rugby Union Football Club, tragically died in November 2012 after sniffing aerosols. 

The carpentry student at Accrington and Rossendale College had lived in supported accommodation at Chapel Street, Brierfield, after several years in a children's home.

Banned: She received a four-year driving ban and was sentenced to 12 weeks in prison - suspended for a year

His birthday was on August 4 and her solicitor told the hearing how Hancock found the time around that date particularly difficult.

John Rusius, defending, said Hancock had had issues with depression and drink, had been in a very difficult relationship and had been 'tipped over the edge' when her son died.

The solicitor added: 'Since this incident she has taken steps to try and address her problems. She is looking at counselling for depression, self harm and suicidal thoughts. 

'Today, hopefully, will be a watershed and she can put everything behind her and make a fresh start. She is trying to put everything right. She is full regret, full of remorse.

'To say she is terrified at the prospect of custody is very much an understatement. Immediate custody would have a terrible and drastic effect upon this particular lady.'
