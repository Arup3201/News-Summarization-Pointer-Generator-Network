Arsene Wenger says Arsenal will be active in the January transfer window after injuries to Mikel Arteta and Mathieu Debuchy.

Wenger confirmed the pair will be out for three months each after Arteta had an ankle operation and Debuchy had surgery on his dislocated shoulder.

That leaves Arsenal short of options at the back, forcing Wenger - who has been linked with moves for West Ham's Winston Reid and Celtic's Virgil van Dijk - into the market.

Wenger said: 'Yes, we are more [in the market now]. We have (Calum) Chambers and we have (Hector) Bellerin, who is coming on well, and I want to give them a chance as well, but of course we are in the market like many other clubs.

'We work really hard, morning until late night, to try to get one or two players in.'

He added: 'We are out in the market and we are working very hard everyday. All our scouts and our people are working very hard to find a defender.' 

Asked whether he was interested in Dortmund midfielder Ilkay Gundogan, Wenger replied: 'He’s not a defender. At the moment we are more looking for the defensive department.'

Debuchy's injury has especially come as a big blow to Arsenal, with the defender only recently returning from a previous injury.

The 29-year-old fell into the advertising hoardings after a push by Stoke's Marko Arnautovic in the 3-0 win last week. Wenger said: 'He is destroyed because he is such a keen player, so professional, so willing. 

'It is his first year here and of course he is embarrassed. But it is not his fault. He was pushed. The push was not needed.'

Wenger also confirmed that Danny Welbeck will be out for a further two weeks due to a thigh injury.

But in more positive news, Arsenal look close to completing their first signing of the transfer window, after Wenger confirmed Krystian Bielik will have a medical with the club on Friday.

The 17-year-old Legia Warsaw midfielder told the club's website: 'I'm going to London to fulfil my dreams. I hope I will become an Arsenal player soon.' 

Wenger also revealed England manager Roy Hodgson consulted him about scrapping a planned squad get-together later this month.

Hodgson was forced into scrapping the idea of calling his squad together after opposition from clubs and Wenger says he was consulted by Hodgson over the issue.

He said: 'Yes he spoke to me about it. It was 48 hours before a Premier League game and managers do no want their players to travel two days before a game maybe. It is good to have a get-together for Roy Hodgson, but maybe the date was not the best.'
