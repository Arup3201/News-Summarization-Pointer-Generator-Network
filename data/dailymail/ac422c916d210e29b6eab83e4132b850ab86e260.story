They may all be from different walks of the showbiz world but Alesha Dixon, Abbey Clancey and Darcey Bussell all share a little secret.

The A-list trio, all of whom have flawless and glowing skin, achieve it with the same product.

And until now, they have kept it a closely guarded secret. 

Each of the stunning starlets are huge fans of Sanctuary Spa body scrubs, and the best part? You can get their super soft skin without the A-list price tag - because it only costs £11.25.

The body scrubs, which are available in Boots, are loved by the stars for their perfectly polished effect.

Containing sea salt from the renowned Dead Sea as well as rich moisturising oils: jojoba, coconut and almond the stars use them to buff away dead skin before moisturising.

Speaking about the product, Darcey Bussell said: 'Sanctuary Salt Scrub leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth,' while Alesha Dixon says it is her favourite exfoliating product.

Abbey Clancey achieves her flawless and supple skin by exfoliating in the shower using the hot sugar scrub product to prep her skin before a big event.

And it seems Abbey Clancey isn't the only WAG fan.

Explaining her skincare regime, Gary Lineker's wife Danielle told the Daily Mirror: 'Before you start your routine, there’s nothing  like a good scrub to give your skin a natural glow.

'I always keep a tub of the Sanctuary’s Salt Scrub in the shower. Salt is an amazing natural exfoliator, but this product also contains coconut and almond oil to  get your skin feeling super soft.

'So whether you prefer baths or showers, apply this first.'
