Ed Balls prides himself on being a political heavyweight, but the BBC seem to have taken the idea a bit too literally.

The Corporation used a picture of Labour’s shadow chancellor with his belly hanging out to illustrate a story on the health benefits of playing football.

The BBC had the grace to crop his head off, but one of the most famous ‘squeezed middles’ in Westminster was quickly spotted.

Whoops: The BBC used this cropped picture of Ed Balls for a story on the health benefits of football

A study in The Lancet found that playing football is a good way for men to lose weight.

When 374 men took part in a 12-week programme of training sessions at a local football club, they had lost and kept off 11lb a year later.

The BBC would usually use a generic stock image of an overweight man to illustrate the story.

But instead a reporter chose the snap of Mr Balls, warming up for a game of football in 2008.

Despite being cropped at the neck, Mr Balls’ green shorts and white shirt made the stomach all too identifiable.

Aides to the shadow chancellor brushed off the apparent gibe, insisting he was too busy training for a marathon to complain

Aides to the shadow chancellor laughed off the apparent gibe at their boss: ‘He is too busy training for his third marathon to complain.’

However, BBC insiders suggested the gaffe had not gone down well with bosses keen to avoid accusations of political bias.

A BBC spokesman said: ‘In retrospect, we accept it would have been better to use a picture that was completely unrecognisable to the public.

‘However we've had no complaints from Ed Balls' office about the use of the image.’
