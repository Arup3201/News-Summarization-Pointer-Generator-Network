Legendary NFL player Jerry Rice finally sold his custom-built mansion after almost six years

NFL legend Jerry Rice has finally sold his custom-built mansion after almost six years for less the half the original asking price.

The six-bedroom, ten-bathroom home in Atherton, California, about 30 miles from San Francisco, was originally put on the market in 2007 for $22million.

But after failing to find a buyer, the former San Francisco 49er sold the home in January for $9million, reports Realtor.com. 

The Hall of Famer had the three-storey mansion built in 2001 and comes complete with a vast array of luxuries - including a dedicated gift wrapping room.

Set in 1.4 acres of one of the U.S's most expensive zip codes, the house boasts a guesthouse, deluxe home cinema, own elevator and game room with full bar.

Befitting for a sportsman known for his gruelling workouts, the mansion also has a full gym, with steam room, sauna and plunge pool.

He told Haute Living Magazine in 2001: 'If I’m up late and can’t sleep, I can just trot downstairs for a workout and then relax in the sauna or rejuvenate with the cold plunge.

'I love it for privacy reasons, too. I love being able to get into my workout without having to consider the social aspects of going out to a gym.'

There is also a seven-car garage and a 5,000 sq ft basement, which houses a games room, full bar, wine room and craft room.

In 2011 Rice filed a lawsuit against prospective buyers after they pulled out of the $11million sale.

The athlete and his then-wife Jackie spent four years planning and building the home, described as French Chateau in style.

Rice previously told Haute Living Magazine: 'The lot is really unique for the area because it is set so far back from the road, it’s perfect because it gives us privacy.

'You don’t want a house that sits right on Atherton Avenue because of the noise and the traffic.

'The beauty of the lot and the long driveway for us as a family was that the kids and I could play outside anytime without having to worry about security or privacy issues.'

Rice is regarded as one of the greatest wide receivers of all time.

He is a member of the NFL Hall of Fame and the holder of three Super Bowl rings which he won playing for the 49ers, as well as an AFC championship with the Oakland Raiders.

He was rated as the greatest player of all time in the National Football League's ten part series - The Top 100: NFL's Greatest Players.

He also holds the record for the most touchdowns scored at 208.
