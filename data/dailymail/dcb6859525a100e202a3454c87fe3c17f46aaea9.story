A body found hidden inside a RV that had been hired for a bachelor party is that of a 22-year-old father from Minnesota who went missing in November.

Kevin Casserly, the father of two young children, had gone missing from his Anoka home on November 12.

His body was discovered hidden inside a RV on Thursday by a group of friends who had hired the vehicle for a trip to the Kentucky Derby.

Victim: The body of 22-year-old Kevin Casserly, who went missing in November, has been found in a rented RV

No cause of death has been released, and results are not yet available from a postmortem examination that was carried out.

His body was found in an exterior compartment of a rented RV by members of a bachelor party who were trying to find the source of a foul smell.

When they hired the RV, its owner, 'Rob', told the group not to use the front compartments because they were out of order.

Jake Wanek, who was part of the bachelor group, said they had pulled over in Winona at about 10pm to collect a few more friends when they found the body.

It 'didn’t look fresh. Let’s put it that way,' he told the Star Tribune.

Dan Trainor, who the bachelor party was being held for, added that the incident felt 'like we were in the middle of a movie'.

Police have not said if the owner of the vehicle has any ties to Mr Casserly.

On Saturday, the victim's family issued a heartfelt statement on a Facebook page that had been set up to try to find Mr Casserly.

'After 24 weeks of searching, it is with heavy hearts that we share with you that Kevin’s body was recovered on Thursday,' the post read.

'To all the volunteers who helped us search for Kevin, thank you from the bottom of our hearts. Words cannot express how much the support has meant to all of us and Kevin's family.'

Mr Casserly was last seen at about 7.30am on November 12. He was spotted barefoot at the side of a highway.

His car was found a short distance away, with an empty tank and the door open. When his mother visited his apartment to look for him she found the door slightly open but all his belongings there, including his wallet and a $20 bill on his kitchen counter.

The 22-year-old, who had suffered from meth addiction in the past, was close to his mom and had been sober for a long period. He had also recently been promoted at his work.

'Nothing right now has led us to believe he's having a relapse,' his sister, Alexander, said shortly after he disappeared.

'To just disappear like this ... he wouldn't do it,. He wouldn't disappear without checking in on his kids,' she added.

Mr Casserly had a six-year-old son and four-year-old daughter who lived with his grandmother, because their mother is struggling with drug addiction.

He was described as a doting father who was determined that his children would not fall into the drug problems he had. He took them to dance and karate lessons, and was working hard to get his life back on track.

Members of the bachelor party who discovered his body were initially taken in for questioning by police, and later released.

John Kirk, who was part of the group traveling to the annual triple crown race, told the Minneapolis Star Tribune
 that he and a few of his friends were instructed by the RV’s owner, 
‘Rob,’ not to open the outside compartment because it did not work.

But when 
the RV rolled into Winona to collect the last of the guests outside 
Shopko, one of them opened the bin, releasing a gust of bad smell into 
the air.

‘I opened it up and I saw two legs and they're bruised or decomposing,’ Trainor told KTSP.

Trainor
 said that in the first few minutes, responding officers treated them as
 potential suspects, but they eventually realized that the revelers had 
nothing to do with the mystery man's death.

The friends were taken to a police station for questioning, which lasted for two hours before they were finally let go.
