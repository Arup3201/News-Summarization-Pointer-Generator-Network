A property tycoon has pledged to leave his £100m fortune to the elderly of Jersey after he was diagnosed with prostate cancer.

David Kirch used his 76th birthday to announce he had would dedicate his wealth to those that are ‘often left out and forgotten.’

He said Jersey had been ‘very good to him’ since he arrived almost 40 years ago and that his illness had ‘sharpened my mind’.

Generous: Mr Kirch, who made his fortune in property in London, hopes his wealth will benefit an estimated 9,000 Jersey islanders

For the last six years Mr Kirch - who has no living family - has given away £100 shopping vouchers as a Christmas gift to every islander older than 70.

Now he hopes the fortune will help an estimated 9,000 Jersey islanders.

He said: ‘I love the island, and so have decided to leave my wealth to benefit the elderly as they are often left out and forgotten.

‘Also, I have recently discovered that I have cancer and I have been amazed at how this has sharpened my mind and changed my perspectives on life.

‘I have worked very hard all my life to earn this money and I want to see it used well.’ Mr Kirch has also put his 600 piece strong collection of airship memorabilia on the market to add to his legacy.

It includes scorched letters found on board the ill-fated Hindenburg, silverware and newspaper billboards from the First World War and is expected to raise £1m.

Mr Kirch - who has never married - made his fortune in the London property market and through investments in the leisure industry and healthcare.

In 2006 it was claimed he had made £2m in two months from dealing in the shares of UK Coal.

Mr Kirch was 70 when he began his scheme to give the septuagenarians and older of Jersey a £100 voucher to spend in the Co-Op at Christmas.

At the time he said: ‘I couldn’t think of a better way to celebrate than to start giving my money away.

‘I have had 70 years to build it up and now was the time to give it away.’ But he has admitted that he had to change his attitude to wealth before giving it away.

He said previously: ‘I have mixed feelings, all my life I have wanted to make money and build it up.

‘I find it difficult, the difference between giving money away and being charitable and building it up to make as much as possible.’

Mr Kirch admitted his wealth had ‘dwindled somewhat’ since it was valued at £250m before the recent financial crisis.

But he added: ‘It still makes a sizeable gift to the community and it is what I want to do.’

When Mr Kirch dies his fortune will go to the David Kirch Charitable Trust which already runs the winter voucher scheme.

The Trust has already built the Margaret and Leonard Terraces named after Mr Kirch’s parents and is building a further 20 bungalows in the Grouville area of Jersey.
