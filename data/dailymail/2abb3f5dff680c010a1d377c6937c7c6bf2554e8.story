From talking owls to controversial rappers, TK Maxx is known for pushing boundaries when it comes to advertising campaigns.

And it would seem that the brand's advertising team haven't lost their touch, after casting not one but two pensioners in the Christmas campaign.

Along with adorable children and pretty women, the TV advert stars veteran actor Paul Collard, 95, and evergreen beauty Daphne Selfe, 85, appears in an accompanying video.

Veteran star: At 92, actor Paul Collard is significantly older than the other models appearing in the advert

Perfect present: 85-year-old model Daphne Selfe is seen talking about her ideal gift

Collard, 92, is seen looking dapper in a tweed jacket, light blue shirt and striped maroon tie in the advert, titled The Moment.

Standing next to a Christmas tree his face lights up with joy at opening his present as he throws his head back in unbridled laughter. 

Miss Selfe, meanwhile, appears in an accompanying film looking glamorous in a grey and black jumper, black coat and silver jewellery and upon being asked what the most perfect gift she has ever received is, answers simply: ‘A beautiful garment.'

But few can match the achievements of Miss Selfe, who began her modelling career more than 60 years ago.

Heartwarming: The short film focuses on the moment when you receive a carefully chosen present

Diversity: Along with Collard and Selfe, The Moment features a wide range of models of varying ages

Festive: The Christmas campaign was directed by James Strong, best known for BBC drama Broadchurch

Silver-haired Miss Selfe has starred in countless catwalk extravaganzas, campaigns and magazine spreads during her career and recently appeared in Channel 4 documentary Fabulous Fashionistas which profiled some of the UK's most glamorous pensioners.

Talking about her style she said: 'I have and wear a lot of vintage clothes and it is how I have always dressed. I still have my ‘going away suit’ which I bought in Madrid in the ‘50’s.

'It’s thick white brocade cotton and can be put in the washing machine. It’s had several ‘updates’ over the years but is still as good as ever and I would hate to part with it.

And her top tip for negotiating a visit to TK Maxx? 'Definitely to go when you are feeling fit and energetic - there's a lot of choice!’

High Street megastore TK Maxx is famous for its labels for less ethos and for its groundbreaking campaigns

Career: Selfe has been modelling for more than 60 years and starred in C4 documentary Fabulous Fashionistas

This years’ Christmas advert has been directed by award winning film and television drama director, James Strong, whose credits include the highly acclaimed BBC drama Broadchurch.

The Moment is set to a special arrangement of the 1982 Yazoo hit, Only You, played by a 30-piece orchestra and recorded at the Abbey Road studios in London.

'Behind all the glitz and glamour of Christmas, we wanted to get to the heart of gift giving and convey the pure joy that comes from finding the perfect gift for someone special - a gift that is as unique as they are,’ said Deborah Dolce, TK Maxx' director of brand and marketing.

‘Our aim was to show people that these are the best gifts. We hope people we love the way we have brought this very touching and unique moment to life, she said.

The Moment will launch on ITV tonight at 7.15pm tonight and until Christmas Eve
