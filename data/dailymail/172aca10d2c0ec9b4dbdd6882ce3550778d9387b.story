Had the Queen been watching Italy’s defeat to Costa Rica she would have been unimpressed by Mario Balotelli.

Before the game, knowing that an Italy win would boost England’s slim chances of advancing from Group D, Balotelli tweeted: ‘If we beat Costa Rica I want a kiss, obviously on the cheek, from the UK Queen.'

The former Manchester City forward led the Italian line brilliantly in their 2-1 win over England on Saturday in Manaus, but he was abject against Costa Rica, fluffing two decent chances in the first half and offering little after the break.

It’s so difficult to predict which Mario Balotelli will turn up.

Against Costa Rica in Recife, we saw the player that angered Jose Mourinho at Inter Milan and fell out of favour at the Etihad before being shipped back to the San Siro to play for AC Milan.

Balotelli barely touched the ball in the opening 20 minutes, as Costa Rica defenders Giancarlo Gonzalez and Oscar Duarte did a fine job of reading his runs and dispossessing him whenever he looked like threatening.

In the 31st minute he spurned a great chance to put Italy ahead, after racing on to a glorious first-time pass from Andrea Pirlo. Balotelli’s first touch was heavy which meant he had to stretch to try and prod a lob over Keylor Navas. The ball cleared the goalkeeper but drifted some way wide of the left-hand post.

Pirlo began to dictate the game after a quiet start, but Balotelli undid his good work on a number of occasions by straying offside and giving away free-kicks for committing unnecessary fouls.

In the 69th minute he received the first booking of the game, for pulling the shirt of Duarte after an Italy move broke down. There was no need for it, and it merely disrupted Italy’s flow as they went in search of an equaliser.

Costa Rica, to their credit, were magnificent. Their high pressing was a risk, but one that spectacularly paid off.

Italy and Balotelli, in particular, failed to make the most of the spaces behind the Costa Rica defence, as their full-backs pushed forward to great effect.

Antonio Candreva, one of the standout performers against England in Manaus, was pinned back by left-back Junior Diaz, and it was the defender’s enticing cross that led to the only goal of the game.

Diaz picked the ball up on the left, bewildered Ignazio Abata, and then sent a brilliant cross to the back post where Fulham reject Bryan Ruiz nodded past an unusually poor Gianluigi Buffon.

Despite scoring just seven times in 76 appearances during his time at Craven Cottage, Ruiz, who spent last season on loan at PSV, only needed one chance to seal a historic win for Costa Rica.

He was given a warm round of applause when he departed with 10 minutes to play, having terrorised Italy’s defence alongside Arsenal striker Joel Campbell, who impressed once again. 

Arsenal have been linked with a summer move for Balotelli, but with Campbell set to be integrated into the first-team squad at the Emirates next season, there may be no need.
