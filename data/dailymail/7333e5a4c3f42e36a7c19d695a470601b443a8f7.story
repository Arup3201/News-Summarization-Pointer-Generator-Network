Missiles fired by Syrian warplanes hit Lebanese territory Monday in one of the most serious cross-border violations since Syria's crisis began 18 months ago.

Four missiles fired by two Syrian jets hit a rugged and remote area on the edge of the Lebanese border town of Arsal. There were no immediate reports of casualties.

Lebanon's state-run National News Agency reported that the warplanes fired three missiles that fell on the outskirts of Arsal about 500 metres from the border between the two countries.

'I heard several explosions and saw four clouds of dust billowing from the area,' Arsal resident Nayeh Izzedine said by telephone referring to the border.

'I don't know if it was an air raid but there was a plane in the sky.'

He added that the town had been quiet two hours after the 10am attack.

The Syrian forces were believed to be chasing rebels in the area, which has been the site of clashes in the past between opposition fighters battling Syrian troops just on the other side of the frontier.

Lebanese armed forces have previously detained people in the region caught trying to smuggle weapons into Syria from Lebanon.

Arsal is a predominantly Sunni Muslim town, like the majority of Syria's opposition that is trying to oust President Bashar Assad from power. Assad belongs to the minority Alawite sect, an off-shoot of Shiite Islam.

Syrian shells have hit Lebanese territory in the past but the air raid appears to be the most serious violation. Several Lebanese, including a journalist, have been killed and dozens wounded by fire coming from the Syrian side.

Also Monday, inside Syria, troops shelled rebel-held areas around the country including the northern city of Aleppo, Syria's largest, and the Damascus neighborhood of Hajar Aswad, activists said. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights and the Local Coordination Committees also reported clashes between troops and rebels.

In Geneva, an independent U.N. panel 
confirmed that an increasing number of 'foreign elements,' including 
jihadis, are now operating in Syria, in its first report to say that 
outsiders have joined a war spiraling out of control.

The
investigative panel appointed by the Human Rights Council says some of 
these forces are joining armed anti-government groups while others are 
operating on their own.

'Such
elements tend to push anti-government fighters toward more radical 
positions,' the head of the panel, Brazilian diplomat and professor 
Paulo Sergio Pinheiro, told diplomats.

The Syrian uprising, which began with 
largely peaceful protests, has since morphed into a deadly armed 
insurgency. Hundreds of people are killed every week as the government 
increasingly relies on air power to try and crush the rebels.

Activists say more than 23,000 have been killed in the conflict.

The government denies that there is any popular will behind the revolt, saying it is driven by foreigners and terrorists. The regime can use the U.N. panel's report to bolster its claims.

Rebels deny that foreigners had any role starting the revolt, saying Syrians were seeking increased freedom from the regime. But as the conflict drags on, some rebels have acknowledged the presence of small numbers of foreigners among their ranks.

The U.N. panel also accused government forces and pro-regime militiamen known as 'shabiha' of war crimes and crimes against humanity including murder, summary executions, torture, arbitrary arrests, sexual violence and abuse of children. It also accused anti-government armed groups of war crimes including murder, extrajudicial execution and torture.

In a report Monday, Human Rights Watch said it documented more than a dozen extrajudicial and summary executions by opposition forces.

It said three opposition leaders who were confronted with evidence of extrajudicial executions said those who killed deserved to be killed, and that only the 'worst criminals were being executed.'

The New York-based group said torture and extrajudicial or summary executions of detainees in the context of an armed conflict are war crimes, and may constitute crimes against humanity if they are widespread and systematic.
