A police spy passed on confidential details about the breakdown of Neville and Doreen Lawrence’s marriage to Scotland Yard bosses.

The undercover officer sent reports of how the couple ‘had, in reality, separated’ during the Macpherson inquiry into their son Stephen’s racist murder.

In one, he made it clear that the collapse of the couple’s marriage ‘is not public knowledge’. Details of the astonishing intrusion of privacy are contained in the Ellison review into the Stephen Lawrence case.

Intrusion: An undercover police officer passed on details about the breakdown of Doreen and Neville Lawrence's marriage to bosses at Scotland Yard, a review into the Stephen Lawrence murder case revealed

Last night Neville Lawrence said the revelations were disgusting: ‘It’s unbelievable. They have mocked everything we have done, telling us to our faces that they are listening and things will change, and all the time laughing behind our backs.

‘I think they are actually worse than criminals, because these officers get paid with taxpayers’ money for what they do.’

The extraordinary revelations of the invasion of the Lawrences’ privacy by an officer attached to Scotland Yard’s disgraced Special Demonstration Squad – an ultra-secret wing of Special Branch – came as:

The incredible scrutiny placed on the private life of the Lawrences is buried in the 100-page Ellison report into the Lawrence case. According to the Ellison review, undercover SDS officer N81 sent his police bosses a series of reports detailing private information back to his police bosses.

It is not clear who read the spy’s reports but a number of very senior former Met officers are set to be quizzed over the privacy breach at the forthcoming public inquiry into undercover policing.

In one report, in July 1998, N81 wrote ‘the main problem facing the [Lawrence] campaign was the refusal of both Neville and Doreen to have anything other to do with other groups ... that they had in reality separated and that they only continued together as a front for the campaign.’

In another, he said: ‘As for the Lawrence family, Doreen and Neville Lawrence split up during the first stage of the Inquiry (although this is not public knowledge). Neville remains the more politicised of the two although Doreen has recently been vocal in her calls for the Commissioner to resign.’

He also claims he was informed that ‘my reporting was going straight to [then Met commissioner] Sir Paul Condon’s desk each morning’.

Last night a shocked Mr Lawrence said: ‘What in heaven’s name has the stage of my marriage got to do with Stephen’s murder? Did they think that Doreen and I had fallen out, and that one of us had decided to have our son murdered to spite the other? That’s the only reason I can think of for them taking the slightest interest in our relationship. This is disgusting. It makes me think that the police officers running the investigation must have taken leave of their senses.

‘From the day I first came to this country more than 50 years ago, I have never been in trouble with the law. Since Stephen’s murder I have gone out of my way to help the police. Now I don’t even want to talk to them again.’

Mr Lawrence said it was deeply ironic that the Met were interested in the breakdown of his marriage, because it might have survived but for the failed murder investigation.

‘There was really nothing wrong with our marriage,’ he said. ‘It was six years after the murder that the divorce took place. Our marriage broke down slowly, over a long drawn-out period directly due to problems with the case, fighting for justice, and our frustration and anger – and that was all down to the way it was handled by then police.

‘So you have a situation where this police spy in our camp was reporting back on a situation the police had created. The marriage probably wouldn’t have collapsed if it wasn’t for them.’

Mr Lawrence ‘sat down and cried’ yesterday, when he heard of the report’s contents at the London office of his solicitor.

‘It was the deceit that really got to me,’ he said. ‘And it just hit me that the police had destroyed my life, and the lives of my family.’

Police Minister Damian Green told BBC Breakfast he understood why the Lawrence family had lost faith in the police.

‘They went through a terrible, unimaginable ordeal 20 years ago and... they are still going through it because we’ve not got to the truth yet,’ he said.

The heroic work of undercover officers who risk their lives on dangerous assignments should not be over-shadowed by the Stephen Lawrence ‘spying’ scandal, a former detective said yesterday.

An undercover officer – codenamed N81 –spied on the Lawrence family while working for Scotland Yard’s Special Demonstration Squad (SDS) in the late 1990s.

But just a few years later, an undercover officer working for a different Scotland Yard unit was bought a house as part of an extraordinary ‘sting’ operation to infiltrate the Lawrence murder gang.

Using a false identity, the officer moved into a property close to one of the prime suspects and tried to befriend him.

The long-term aim of the mission – carried out amid enormous secrecy – was to try to obtain a murder confession. The operation highlighted the risks taken by detectives in their bid to gain justice for Stephen. Up to 20 officers were on standby in case their undercover colleague’s cover was blown and his life put at risk.

Ultimately, the operation failed to obtain new leads. But former Met Det Sgt Chris Hobbs, who once worked in Special Branch, told the Mail: ‘Critics of SDS undercover officers seem to be unaware that another undercover Met officer literally risked his life by attempting to befriend Stephen’s killers by virtue of living in a house close to one of the suspects.

‘Even before Stephen’s tragic death, racial tensions were high and Special Branch monitored neo-Nazi groups in the same way that they did those on the Left and their efforts unquestionably saved lives. Despite mistakes that were made, most SDS officers were brave, committed and dedicated. Now retired, those same officers are apprehensive at the current furore and concerned that being the subject of any inquiry may endanger both themselves and their families.’

Mr Hobbs, now a commentator on police issues, added: ‘The current furore will do little to lift the ever-growing black cloud that threatens a police service, which, for all its imperfections, is still the best and most restrained in the world.’
