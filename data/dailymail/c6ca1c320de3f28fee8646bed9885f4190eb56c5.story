With the endless downpours soaking the country, one resourceful group of primates has refused to be beaten by the torrential rain.

Determined to get out and enjoy their enclosure the gorillas at Chessington World of Adventures have designed their very own 'umbrellas' to shelter from the wet weather.

The bright group were spotted throwing straw over their heads to keep their fur dry and glossy.

And keepers at the resort in Surrey said they have also noticed the primates making 'gloves' and 'slippers' to protect their hands and feet.

Female gorillas are used to creating nests for the rest of the band, and are particularly good at crafting rain shielding clothing and canopies, the team at Chessington said.

A spokeswoman said: 'In both practical and promiscuous fashion, the females will design elaborate creations to impress the males and keep their fur dry and glossy.

'Male gorillas also construct clothing to keep the rain out, however the silverback, Damisi refrains from creating a protective device, relying on the females to do the job for him.'

The band of nine Western Lowland Gorillas also used the straw to make 'gloves' and 'slippers' to cover their hands and feet

Lisa Britton, Primate Keeper at Chessington World of Adventures Resort, said: 'Gorillas are highly intelligent primates and, like us, they don't like getting their hair wet

Lisa Britton, Primate Keeper at Chessington World of Adventures Resort, said: 'Gorillas are highly intelligent primates and, like us, they don't like getting their hair wet.

'By manipulating their surroundings to create umbrellas, gloves and slippers, gorillas are able to keep dry when the good old British weather is at its worst.

'The females are the best at building protective layers, and use the rain as an excuse to show off their creative skills to the males by building big straw structures.

'There's a practical side to it, too, as the gorillas are able to keep their fur, partners and their babies, out of rain's way.'

Chessington World of Adventures Resort is home to nine Western Lowland Gorillas.

Ms Britton said the females are best at building protective layers and use it as an excuse to show off to the males. But she said there was a practical side too, keeping themselves and their young dry, pictured above
