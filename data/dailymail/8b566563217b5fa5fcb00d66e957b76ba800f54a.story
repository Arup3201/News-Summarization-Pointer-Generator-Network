SAPHIR DU RHEU (Cheltenham, 3.20) has a good way to go before being mentioned in the same breath as World Hurdle legend Big Buck’s, but he can begin to write his own chapter in history with victory on Thursday.

The festival sprung to life for Paul Nicholls on day two and the son of Al Namix, who sports the same colours as his illustrious predecessor, has undergone an unusual preparation for the hurdling feature following three starts over fences.

It was a path also trodden by Big Buck’s and Nicholls will be hoping lightning strikes twice for the six-year-old who displayed great tenacity to land the Cleeve Hurdle from Reve De Sivola in January.

The bare form of that performance is arguably short of what is required but if his handler has managed to extricate some improvement he should be thereabouts. Monksland and Jetson appeal as outsiders capable of outrunning their prices.

Having backed HIDDEN CYCLONE (Cheltenham, nb, 2.40) for the Champion Chase, I was frustrated to see him rerouted for Thursday’s Ryanair Chase, but it still looks a smart move by connections.

Shark Hanlon’s gelding was runner-up in the race last year when outstayed by Dynaste and I wonder, with hindsight, if jockey Andrew McNamara may have employed a more patient ride as he became a sitting target late on.

A recent Punchestown romp should have put the selection spot-on and he could go one better this year and end the Irish hoodoo in this race.

With the Willie Mullins stable carrying all before them, Vautour will be a popular order in the JLT Novices’ Chase.

However, he will be priced accordingly and VALSEUR LIDO (Cheltenham, 1.30) looks a sound alternative as he was reported to be a little ring-rusty when edged out by Apache Stronghold at Leopardstown last time.

The selection had previously beaten that foe by an impressive eight lengths at Fairyhouse and appears to jump a shade more fluently than Noel Meade’s charge, who remains one of the chief dangers.

There will be plenty of tips doing the rounds for the Pertemps Network Final but TRUSTAN TIMES (Cheltenham, nap, 2.05) is a solid conveyance for a race of this nature and may run well at a big price.

The nine-year-old lacks the profile of a number of his rivals, but was a creditable third in the race last year — beaten by just a nose and a neck — and looks to have been campaigned with just one race in mind all season.
