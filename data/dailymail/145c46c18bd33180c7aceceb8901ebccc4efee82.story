She has watched her friends grow into young women but Laxmi Yadev has not changed since the age of five.

Now 20 years old, Laxmi is still only three feet three inches tall, weighs just three stone and wears clothes meant for six-year-old children.

A rare genetic disorder meant Laxmi stopped growing 15 years ago and she is resigned to living the rest of her life as a woman trapped in a child's body.

Genetic disorder: Laxmi Yadev, aged 20, stopped growing 15 years ago and weighs just 3 stone

Trapped: Laxmi, pictured right trying on adults' shoes and left with her younger sister Suman, admits thinking about the life she could have had makes her 'sad'

Laxmi has endured years of bullying and stares but she says the hardest thing to come to terms with is the future she has been denied by her condition.

She knows she will never have children and therefore she does not see the point in marrying.

She admits she is also scared of trusting a man and fears being disowned in the marriage.

Laxmi, from Gurgoan, outside of New Delhi, told The Sunday People: 'I sometimes think about the normal life I could have had and it makes me sad.

'I'd have fun and independence and enjoy a life I see other girls having.'

Years of taunts and fears about being kidnapped have left Laxmi too scared to go out alone but she says she is able to cope with her disorder through the support of her family.

Her mother, Parvati, 52, buys her clothes to save her the embarrassment of shopping in the children's section.

Her brother Azad suffers from the same condition but her gone on to forge a career as a teacher and believes bullies have made him work 
even harder to achieve his goals.

Her youngster sister Suman, 15, who is normal height, chaperones Laxmi outside and helps 'motivate' her.

Support: Laxmi said Suman (left) and brother Azad (front right), who suffers from the same condition, are her best friends and she is motivated by her father Bahadur Singh and mother Parvati Devi (back row)

Laxmi said: 'I hate meeting new people as it hurts getting stared at and bullied every time.'

But she says by following the lead of Azad and with the support of her father Bahadur and her mother, she is facing her fears and starting a job in a shop.

Laxmi said: 'I'm scared but I'm tough and I'll overcome my fears to do this.'

The money will be crucial for her family, who rely on the 8,000 rupees (£88) a month he earns as a security guard.

The family's small income has already had tragic consequences.

They could not afford the money needed for human growth hormone for Laxmi and Azad.

Their condition could have been improved had they received it before the age of 16 or 17.

Doctors say some treatments are still available but they are significantly more effective when given early.

However, despite her difficulties, Laxmi has thrived in her studies.

She graduated from high school with top marks and now wants to start a computer course at college.
