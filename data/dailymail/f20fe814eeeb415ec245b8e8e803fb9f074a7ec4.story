'I told you so': Shadow Secretary of State for Justice Sadiq Khan says he has been warning about this for three years

Prisons in England and Wales are more than 99 per cent full, fresh figures have revealed.

The prison population hit 84,987 in the last week, up 155 on the previous week, while total capacity stands at 85,828, down 230 places over the same period, Ministry of Justice data showed.

With only 841 places remaining, prisons in England and Wales are now 99.02 per cent full.

The number of prisoners has fallen by more than 1,000 in the last 12 months, but a raft of jail closures has seen capacity drop by 5,246 places.

In total, 13 prisons have closed since May 2010, with three partially shut, and four more to close by next spring.

The Government is planning to build a so-called super prison in Wrexham, which will hold more than 2,000 inmates.

Sadiq Khan MP, Labourâ€™s shadow justice secretary said: 'Making sure there are enough spaces in our prisons for all those that need locking up is one of the basics of the job for any Justice Secretary.

'The public need confidence that when a judge sends someone down for a serious or violent crime, they can be locked away securely.

'I have been warning about the risk of prison places running out for three years now,' he added. 'It gives me no pleasure saying "I told you so".'

Juliet Lyon, director of the Prison Reform Trust, said: 'There are enough prison places to hold serious and violent offenders for whom prison is the right place of last resort.

'Questions need to be raised about the pace and scale of change in the justice system.

'Solutions lie not in closing small local prisons and building supersized jails but in effective community sentences, treatment for addicts and mental health care.

'Cramming ever greater numbers of people into overcrowded prisons with fewer staff and less time out of cell is no way to transform rehabilitation.'
