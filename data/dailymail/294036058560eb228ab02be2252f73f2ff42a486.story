Sarah Murnaghan, the 10-year-old Pennsylvania girl whose need for new lungs sparked a national debate on how donor organs are prioritized, is finally back at home after six months in the hospital.

A family spokeswoman has said Sarah was discharged today from The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia.

She later was carried into her family's Newtown Square home, where the entrance was festooned with balloons and bore a big sign saying 'Welcome Home, Sarah!'

After SIX months in the hospital and agonizing surgeries, 11-year-old Sarah Murnaghan finally arrives home in Newtown Square, Pennsylvania

We've been tracking the 11-year-old girl's battle with cystic fibrosis since June, when her family began a public campaign to get their little girl a new set of lungs

Sarah received two sets of lungs this summer as she struggles with the effects of end-stage cystic fibrosis.

The operations came after a federal judge intervened in her parents' lawsuit challenging national transplant rules that put her at the end of the waiting list for adult lungs.

Hmother, Janet Murnaghan, wrote in a Facebook post late Monday that she and her daughter had 'cried tears of joy' and wrote: 'WE ARE GOING HOME TOMORROW'.

'We entered CHOP on Feb. 19, more than six months ago. I never could have imagined the journey that lay in front of us,' Murnaghan wrote in the post, thanking God, Sarah's donors and all those who supported the family.

She said she plans to speak with reporters today.

Sarah received the two lung transplants after a federal judge intervened in her parents' lawsuit challenging national transplant rules that put her at the end of the waiting list for adult lungs.

The news capped days of upbeat progress reports from the Newtown Square family.

On Sunday, Murnaghan said her daughter was taken off oxygen, although she still gets support from a machine that helps her to breathe, and had started to walk with the aid of a walker, even venturing outside.

'My sister pointed out that today is our Mom's birthday - she died 11 years ago,' Murnaghan wrote Saturday on her Facebook page.

'And today is the first day Sarah has not needed any supplemental oxygen. Miracles from heaven!!!'

Family spokeswoman Tracy Simon said 
Sarah's recovery is now focused on building her muscle strength so she 
no longer has to use a breathing tube.

She said Sarah recovered from a case of pneumonia that stemmed from the tube.

Sarah's first set of adult lungs failed after a June 12 transplant. A second set was transplanted three days later.

Her parents sued to change a national transplant policy that put her at the bottom of the adult list for patients 12 and older.

After
the federal judge intervened, the Organ Procurement and Transplantation
Network - the private nonprofit group that manages U.S. organ 
allocation - added Sarah to the adult list.

The
case raised questions among some health specialists and medical 
ethicists about how organ donation rules are developed and under what 
circumstances they might be disregarded.

The 11-year-old said that she was taking it one step at a time.

'I'm not going for easy...I'm just going for possible, and what's in front of me right now is possible,' Sarah told CNN.
