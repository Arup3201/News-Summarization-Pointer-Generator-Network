A club owner has come up with a novel way to try and beat the recession. He is allowing people to bring their own alcohol with them.

Bob Senior, who runs a Durham Live Club in Durham, said his industry had been wrecked by supermarkets selling cheap alcohol.

And in what appears to be case of 'if you can't beat them, join them', he is charging an entry fee, but allowing customers to provide their own drink.

While the practice is common in restaurants that don't have an alcohol licence, it is thought to be the first time a nightclub has made such a move.

Bob Senior has come up with the idea of letting people into his club with their own alcohol in the fight back against supermarkets

Mr Senior said:  'Business in nightclubs is down 70 per 
cent in the last five years and big companies are going out of business.

'This is because bars have been allowed to open 24 hours and 
supermarkets are selling very cheap drink.

'People are either staying in
and having house parties or they're spending several hours drinking 
cheap alcohol before they go out.

'Nightclubs cannot compete. We have to
be imaginative if we are to going to survive.'

Revellers pay Â£7 to enter the club which provides glasses and ice so that people can keep their drink cool.

Mr Senior said the idea would initially be operated just on Friday and Monday nights.

He added: 'Our principal aim is to accept the reality of the situation that has been developing and accelerating over the last nine years.'

Not everybody agrees that it is a good idea, however, with Safe Durham Partnership saying it could be bad for people's health.

Claire Sullivan, chairman of an alcohol group, said: 'We believe it poses a number of risks including the potential for greater consumption of higher-strength drinks such as spirits and wines.

Bob Senior says the move has been driven in part by cheap supermarket alcohol

'This will not just have a detrimental impact on the health of the individuals but may in turn impact on Accident and Emergency and ambulance services and increase disorder, including domestic and sexual violence.

'There is also the potential for glassware in the club to be used as a weapon both within and outside the premises, possibly increasing the risk of injury, violent crime and litter.

Durham Police spokesman said: 'We have been made aware of the proposal to allow people to bring their own drinks into Durham Live.

'While the police are not the licensing authority, it is obviously something we will monitor closely as part of our commitment to managing Durham's night-time economy.'

Mr Senior added: 'We will be monitoring the customers and their behaviour as always, and show zero tolerance for anyone acting irresponsibly or excessively.'
