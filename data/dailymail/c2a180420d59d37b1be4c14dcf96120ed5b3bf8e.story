A French commando raid aimed at freeing a hostage from Al Qaeda warlords ended in disaster yesterday as one soldier was killed and another was reported missing.

There were reports that the man they were attempting to free in war-torn Somalia had been shot dead – a claim denied by those holding him.

French special forces arrived in the village of Bulo Marer, 50 miles from the capital Mogadishu, in the early hours.

Rescue bid: Despite earlier claims French secret agent Denis Allex had been killed, Al-Shabab insisted he was still alive but now plan to 'execute' him

Their mission was to free Denis Allex, the pseudonym for a secret agent who was captured in the east African country in 2009 while working for France’s overseas intelligence agency DGSE.

Denis Allex appeared in videos aimed at the French government pleading for help to set him free.His first appeal in 2010, a year after he was captured, saw him call on then-President Nicolas Sarkozy to drop French support for the Somali government, for whom he had been training soldiers before he was held.Then, in July 2012, looking gaunt, he sent a video message to new President Francois Hollande, telling how his hopes of a rescue were fading by the day.He calls on France to drop its 'oppressive attitude' towards Muslims and says Mr Hollande represented his last hope of rescue.Poignantly, he adds: 'I am alive. But for how long?'

However, within minutes of arriving, the commandos were involved in a firefight that saw a soldier killed.

Up to 17 Somalis were killed in scenes reminiscent of the battle of Mogadishu in 1993, which is commonly referred to as Black Hawk Down  after a book and film about the incident.

Then, a US army force  tried to seize Somali warlords in the city but two UH-60 Black Hawk helicopters  were shot down, resulting  in the deaths and wounding of 18 Americans, and up to  3,000 Somalis.

Those involved in yesterday’s attack were members of militant  Islamist group Al-Shabab,  the Somalian representatives of Al Qaeda.

French defence minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said: ‘A French commando was killed and another is missing.’

Despite earlier French claims about Mr Allex being killed, Al-Shabab insisted he was still alive – and had not even been in the village.

In a statement, the group said it had ‘killed several’ French soldiers and that Mr Allex was ‘safe and far from the location of the battle’.

Mr Allex has appeared in propaganda videos since his capture, pleading for his release and for France to change its stance.

French Defence Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian confirmed the failed mission to rescue Denis Allex

The failed raid came just a few hours 
after France began a military operation in Mali to assist the government
there against encroaching rebels linked to Al Qaeda.

It was formed as a radical offshoot of the Union of Islamic Courts in 2006.

Affiliated to al-Qaeda, it controls large swathes of south and central Somalia and in 2010 it was responsible for the deaths of 76 people in a double attack in Uganda during 2010 football World Cup.

It is estimated to have 7,000 to 9,000 fighters. al-Shabab means 'The Youth' in Arabic.

A French combat 
pilot was killed in the country yesterday.

However, Mr Le Drian insisted that the
Somalia raid was nothing to do with Mali.

This followed fears that Mr 
Allex would be executed in an act of revenge.

David Cameron yesterday expressed his 
‘deep concern’ about the situation in Mali as Foreign Office sources 
confirmed Britain is preparing to back the military action, reportedly 
by sending two Army officers.

l Meanwhile, President Francois 
Hollande says France will raise its domestic terror threat level in 
light of events in Mali and Somalia.
