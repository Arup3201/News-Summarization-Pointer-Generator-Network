An elementary school is being investigated by police after a seven-year-old pupil died from an allergic reaction to peanuts.

Ammaria Johnson, a first grade student at Hopkins Elementary School in Chesterfield County, Virginia, died after suffering the reaction on the first day back after the Christmas holidays.

She complained about shortness of breath and had broken out in hives during a recess break on Monday before being treated by the school's nurse.

Tragic: Ammaria Johnson, who 'loved school and her teachers' died after suffering an allergic reaction to peanuts on a recess break

Probe: Hopkins Elementary School in Chesterfield County, Virginia, is being investigated after the child's mother raised questions over Ammaria Johnson's treatment

The youngster then went into cardiac arrest, which her family said was caused by her coming into contact with a peanut product.

Although it is not clear where or when Ammaria may have eaten a peanut-based product, her devastated mother said she tried to leave an Epipen with school staff in case of a reaction, but was told to keep it at home instead.

The first grade student came into contact with a peanut product after a friend shared a snack with her on a recess break, according to the examiner.com.

Laura Pendleton has since claimed the school did not follow their own allergy action plan in treating her seven-year-old daughter.

Lt. Jason Elmore, a spokesman for the Chesterfield County Fire Department, said: 'From what we understand, she possibly had gotten something outside.'

Chesterfield Schools spokesperson Shawn Smith said: 'At the beginning of the school year, we sent home a packet to the family, the understanding that there are certain students that have severe allergies.'

According to Chesterfield police spokeswoman Elizabeth Caroon, the initial investigation revealed that Ammaria died after she suffered an allergic reaction.

Chesterfield County School policy apparently states that parents are supposed to provide the school medication for children with allergies.

Public Health Nurse Supervisor for the Chesterfield County Health Department, Jody Enoch, said: 'Parents need to provide all necessary medication their child needs to the school.

'That is the responsibility of the parent.'

Her mother still has questions which she wants the school to address.

She said: 'She has an allergy action plan at the school. They didn't do that.'

Pendleton also wanted to know how her daughter got access to the peanut product.

She added that her daughter 'loved school, she loved her teachers, she was compassionate, she cared about everybody.'

Spokesman Shawn Smith added in a statement: 'Our thoughts and prayers are with the family.Â  The school division will continue to provide additional services to support students and staff in this difficult time.'

Ammaria Johnson's body will be released to her family today.

School officials encouraged all parents to submit a list of their child's allergies that can be retained on file.
