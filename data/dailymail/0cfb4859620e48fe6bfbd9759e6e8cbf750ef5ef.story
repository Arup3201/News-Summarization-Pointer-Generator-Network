He often has short dance numbers on the X Factor.

So Dermot O'Leary was understandably a bit perturbed when his routine was interrupted on Sport Relief.

Any when the interrupter's moves weren't quite up to scratch, it was even more embarrassing.

What were you thinking? Davina McCall busts a move, interrupting Dermot O'Leary's dance on sport relief

As he was dancing with a handful of scantily-clad girls, his co-presenter Davina McCall couldn't help but join in.

The 44-year-old started showing off her moves to LMFAO's Party Rock, much to Dermot's dismay.

He immediately jumped in yelling: 'Wow, wow.'

She's got sex appeal! The presenter has a boogy, much to Dermot's dismay

She asked: 'Was it too much?'

He retorted with: 'It's like walking in on my sister getting changed. it's not right.'

Later, as David Walliams was introduced to talk about his swim of the Thames for Sport Relief last year, he asked her: 'What were you thinking?'

She admitted: 'My kids would have hatted it!'

Dressing in theme: The star wore a complete red ensemble with a feather wrap and red jeans

Don't interrupt me! Dermot was enjoying his dance number with the stunning Sport Relief girls

Fans took to Twitter to mock her 
dance skills, with one joking: 'I think I've seen my parents dance 
better when they're drunk than Davina McCall sober on Sports Relief.'

But the presenter's efforts were all for a good cause.

She joined a host of celebrities for this years Sport Relief including David Beckham, Gary Linekar, Miranda Hart and JLS.

£50,447,197 has already been raised. This smashes Sport Relief’s last total on the night (£29,323,818).

The UK Government has backed the public’s support for this year’s Sport 
Relief with £10m towards the overall total, specifically for Comic 
Relief’s work to improve the lives of a million people living in urban 
slums in Africa. This contribution by the Government matches pound for 
pound Comic Relief’s own commitment to funding in this area.

The overall total also includes £4,031,108.28 raised so far by 
Sainsbury’s – the biggest corporate cheque of the night. As well as 
selling Sport Relief goodies, from Sport Relief Socks and sweat bands 
made with Fairtrade cotton to waterbottles and clappers, Sainsbury’s 
colleagues across the country have been doing all manner of 
fundraising. 

Hundreds of products in store also carried a donation to 
Sport Relief and to top it all off Sainsbury's are the headline sponsor 
of the Sainsbury's Sport Relief Mile.

Also included in the total is £6,173,895 raised by the BT Sport Relief 
Challenges.  This total includes £1m pledged by BT in support of the 
challenges, and over £1.3m raised by Radio 1 listeners. The total is 
broken down as follows: Walliams vs TheThames (£2,501,240), Bishop’s 
Week of Hell (£3,412,261) and Flintoff’s Record Breakers (£260,394). 

British Airways have also raised £1,800,787 this Sport Relief through 
onboard collections, colleague fundraising and other activities. 
 
BT handled over 260,000 calls to the donation line during the live TV 
show, peaking at 134 calls per second. BT coordinated over 9,000 
volunteers at 128 call centres across the UK.
