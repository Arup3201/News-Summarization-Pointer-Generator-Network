It started as a surprise gift for Steve Preston’s 50th birthday.

But yesterday the businessman was really celebrating after the horse bought by his friends and family won the main race of the day at the Cheltenham Festival.

When Mr Preston chose to mark his half century birthday, his 50 guests clubbed together and gave him £2,000, which they told him he had to put towards buying a racehourse. He used the money towards becoming the majority owner of a £35,000 horse, along with his three sons and three friends, who include a hairdresser, a plumber and a sweets salesman.

More than four years later, that horse, Sire De Grugy, yesterday came in first in the Queen Mother Champion Steeple Chase, winning £199,325 in prize money.

Mr Preston, who runs a sporting goods firm, and his friends flooded into the parade ring after the victory decked out in blue and red Sire De Grugy scarves, the colours of his other love, Crystal Palace football club.

After being presented with the winning trophy by the Duchess of Cornwall, who was also given one of the scarves, Mr Preston, of Runcorn in Cheshire, said: ‘I don’t know what to say – I am absolutely and completely made up. This horse has just proven he is really classy like his owners. I cannot believe it – it is fantastic.’ 

His son Ryan added: ‘I exploded when he 
jumped into the lead, dropped my phone, scarf in the air and was running
 around like a lunatic – what a winner!’

Before yesterday, the horse had already won a dozen races for Mr Preston, netting £343,000 prize money

Sire De Grugy, which was 11-4 favourite, was ridden by jockey Jamie Moore and is trained  by his father Gary Moore. Before yesterday, the horse had already won a dozen races for Mr Preston, netting £343,000 in prize money.

Yesterday’s racing was marred by two more deaths of horses. Akdam was put down after it suffered a fractured leg in the Juvenile Handicap Hurdle. In the same race, jockey Bryan Cooper was taken down while riding Clarcam and suffered a broken leg. The 21-year-old had been due to ride in the Gold Cup. The third horse, Stack The Deck was put down after falling in the seventh race.

Zara Phillips yesterday returned to the Festival for a second day. She was joined by her mother Princess Anne and sister-in-law Autumn Phillips.
