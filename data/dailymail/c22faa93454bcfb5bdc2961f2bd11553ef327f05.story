In April 1977, a young woman set off from the centre of Australia to cross 2700km of desert and bush with four camels and a dog

It was the epic journey of a beautiful young Australian through the outback, the whirlwind romance she had amid the dunes and the mystery of why she made the trek.

It is Robyn Davidson's real life story and now, finally, almost 37 years later, it is about to premiere on the screen in a new movie, Tracks, starring Mia Wasikowska as the young Davidson.

Almost 37 years after Robyn Davidson (right) made history crossing the Australian desert her epic 2700 km journey has been recreated in a film, Tracks, starring actress Mia Wasikowska (left) playing her younger self

May 1, 1978: Robyn Davidson, then aged 27, with her camels on the beach in Western Australia, with the Indian Ocean behind them in the late afternoon on a perfect day when the camels got their first glimpse at the large expanse of water

After braving the harshness and dangers of the desert, Robyn Davidson had the exhilarating moment of reaching the Indian Ocean off Western Australia, recreated here by Mia Wasikowska in the new film Tracks

Davidson's 2700km crossing of Australia, from the Northern Territory town of Alice Springs to the Indian Ocean off Western Australia became a legend among desert Aboriginal tribes and a puzzle to many Australians to this day.

The journey shaped Davdison's life, the enigmatic blonde becoming a writer with a passion for studying nomadic people who had relationships with famous, enigmatic men, including Salman Rushdie.

Her trip made headlines around the world, and Davidson's subsequent book, Tracks, became an international bestseller, which filmmakers have been trying to bring to the screen for decades.

Now as the 63-year-old, who divides her time between Australia, London and India, is preparing for cinema audiences around the world to see what her young self encountered on her odyssey of self discovery.

The desert romance of Robyn Davidson and photographer Rick Smolan (above, played by Wasikowska and Driver) is a centrepiece of the film Tracks

Davidson has never explained precisely why, at the age of 25, she took off for Alice Springs to train for two years in how to handle camels and to survive the harshness of the desert.

She then embarked on her journey with camels Dookie, Bub, Zeleika and Goliath, and dog, Diggity.

The film shows Wasikowska as Davidson, in dusty and ragged clothes, her beautiful dirt-smeared face against the haunting light and breathtaking backdrop of the wilds of the Australian desert.

Her only companions were members of local Aboriginal tribes and a charismatic young New Yorker and National Geographic photographer, Rick Smolan (played in the film by Adam Driver), who captured parts of the trip and with whom she had an affair.

Davidson's encounters with Aboriginals during her 2700km trek makes for some memorable scenes in the film (above)

The key to the young Davidson's desire to escape from civilisation on her life-changing expedition may lie in her childhood.

When she was an 11-year-old schoolgirl living on a cattle property in outback Queensland, Davidson's mother committed suicide, after which she was brought up by her father's unmarried sister.

Davidson told the Sydney Morning Herald to equate her trek with the suicide was 'grossly simplified' but that that her mother was 'a powerful absence'.

Rick Smolan, who remains lifelong friends with Davidson, describes her as a 'dreamer'.

Following the success of Tracks, Davidson wrote further books about her travels, From Alice to the Ocean and Desert Places.

She had a relationship with Salman Rushdie, after the author came to Australia, read Tracks, fell in love with Davidson's writing, and then with Davidson.

"Robyn' (Mia Wasinkowska) and the real Robyn sit in the doorway of the actress's trailer on the set of Tracks, and against the stunning backdrop of the outback where Davidson advised and reassure the actress in her role

Later, she lived in the foothills of the Himalayas with an Indian man she met after she attended the annual Pushkar Camel Fair.

About her book finally coming to the screen, Davidson said she had resisted earlier offers because she wanted it to be an Australian, not a Hollywood film.

'I was such a purist I just didn’t want Hollywood to have it. I thought . . . It should have its own values that are close to what the journey itself meant, and what the book meant.'

Finally she agreed to a production with Oscar-winning producer of The King’s Speech, Emile Sherman and Davidson was both consulted for the film and travelled with cast and crew on location in the Australian desert.

Tracks has been screened at the Venice Film Festival, and was the official selection for the Toronto International Film Festival and Telluride Film Festival.
