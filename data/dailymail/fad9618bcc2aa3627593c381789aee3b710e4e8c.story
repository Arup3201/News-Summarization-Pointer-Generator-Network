Cancer is set to overtake heart disease and stroke as Britain's biggest killer, experts are predicting.

The number of deaths from cardiovascular disease has dropped across the country and most of Europe, scientists have found.

And a 'tipping point' is approaching when deaths from stroke and heart disease will be outnumbered by fatalities due to cancer - especially among men.

The number of deaths from cardiovascular disease has dropped across the country and most of Europe, scientists have found

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) has declined across most of the continent, but the rates of deaths vary enormously from western to eastern Europe, researchers found.

In Britain,the CVD death rates for 2010 were 205 and 129 per 100,000 men and women respectively.

Researchers found that in some Eastern European countries, including Russia and Ukraine, the death rate from coronary heart disease for 55 to 60-year-olds is greater than the equivalent rate for people from France who are twenty years older. 

Scientists said that CVD remains the single, greatest cause of death among Europeans than any other disease, and, in many countries causes twice as many deaths as cancer.

But researchers found there were some countries where cancer was now already causing more deaths than heart disease in men.

The countries included Belgium, Denmark, France, Israel, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal Slovenia, Spain and San Marino.

The research was led by Dr Melanie Nichols, of the British Heart Foundation (BHF) Centre on Population Approaches for Non-Communicable Disease Prevention at the University of Oxford.

She said cancer had also overtaken CVD as the main cause of death among women in one European country - Denmark.

The report's co-author Dr Nick Townsend, said: 'The reason why cancer has overtaken cardiovascular disease as the main cause of death in these countries is due to the fact that fewer people develop cardiovascular disease and, in those who do, fewer die from it.

'This is probably due to improvements in the behavioural risk factors associated with CVD, such as decreases in the number of people smoking tobacco, along with better treatments, including preventive ones, such as the increasing use of statins.

'However, increases in some risk factors, such as rising levels of obesity, suggest that these decreasing trends may be in danger of reversing.'

Dr Nichols and her colleagues in the Oxford research group looked at trends in deaths from CVD over a period of ten years analysing data for 52 out of 53 European countries - there was no data available for Andorra. 

Researchers said that data from the latest available year showed that there were just over four million deaths, 1.9 million men and 2.2 million women, from CVD, close to half of all deaths in Europe.

Heart disease is still killing three times as many women than breast cancer despite declining death rates across Europe - a 'stark reminder' for them to live a healthier lifestyle, said the British Heart Foundation. 

Simon Gillespie, chief executive of the charity and board member of the European Heart Network, said: 'It is good news the number of lives being taken too soon by cardiovascular disease is falling across Europe.

'However, the fact remains heart disease and stroke remain the biggest cause of death among Europeans.

'Perhaps surprisingly, more women are dying from cardiovascular disease than men.

'These figures are a stark reminder that women need to be more aware of their heart health as heart disease kills almost three times as many women as breast cancer.

'We have made huge progress in the fight against heart disease and stroke.

'It is only because of the medical breakthroughs the BHF funds, with the help of our generous supporters, that we are finding newer, better ways to prevent, treat and cure heart disease.

'But there is still a long way to go if we want to narrow the unacceptable gap in survival rates across Europe.'

 

This was made up of 1.8 million deaths from coronary heart disease, one million from cerebrovascular disease (stroke) and 1.2 million from other cardiovascular diseases.

Researchers said that just under a million men died before the age of 75 and half a million before the age of 65. 

Half a million women died before the age of 75 and just over 200,000 before the age of 65. 

Three in every ten deaths of Europeans aged under 65 were caused by CVD, as were 3 per cent of all deaths occurring before the age of 75

Dr Townsend said: 'The proportion of women who die from cardiovascular disease is much greater than men - 51 per cent of women died compared to 42 per cent of men. 

In Britain,the Cardiovascular disease death rates for 2010 were 205 and 129 per 100,000 men and women respectively

'This difference is driven mainly by a higher rate of stroke and other cardiovascular diseases among women.

'There was very little difference in the rates of coronary heart disease between men and women - 20 per cent versus 21 per cent respectively.'

Researchers said that CVD death rates are declining in most, but not all European countries.

They added that trends have also been downwards for what are known as 'case fatality rates' - the percentage of people who are diagnosed with a condition and die from the illness within a given period. 

In their paper, the authors say: 'Worldwide, there have been few moments in history during which NCDs [non-communicable diseases] have enjoyed such a prominent place in the world's attention, with cardiovascular disease at the forefront of the activity.

'Despite this, there has been little commitment at the national or regional level to greater monitoring and reporting of risk factors and outcomes for cardiovascular disease.

'It is clear that in many countries of Europe, CVD mortality has continued to decrease substantially in recent years, and will make a large contribution to achieving this goal.

'In these (predominantly high income) countries, a "tipping point" is rapidly approaching, when cancer deaths will outnumber cardiovascular disease deaths, particularly among men. 

'In many other countries, however, the CVD burden dwarfs that of cancer, and a large proportion of the populations will lose their lives prematurely to heart disease and stroke.' 

The research was published in the European Heart Journal.
