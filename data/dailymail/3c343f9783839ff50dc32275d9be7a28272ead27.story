A magistrate claimed £22,500 in disability benefits but was filmed trying downhill grass skiing during a Channel 4 TV show, a court has heard.

Wayne Middleton, 48, also abseiled down a 150ft tower and took part in stilt walking when he appeared on Coach Trip in 2011.

North Somerset Magistrates Court also heard he took up salsa dancing as a hobby and continued to teach despite having told the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) he was 'unable to walk without being in severe pain'.

Wayne Middleton leads a salsa lesson despite being 'unable to walk without being in severe pain'. He has been claiming disability benefits since 2003

North Somerset Magistrates Court heard Middleton had began claiming disability living allowance and incapacity benefits in 2003 after being diagnosed with Fibromyalgia, a long-term condition that causes pain all over his body.

But the DWP claims the former zoo volunteer  failed to inform them that the condition had improved and continued claiming handouts for six years between 2005 and 2011.

The court was told Middleton became so accomplished at salsa dancing he trained as an instructor and taught at least two 45 minute classes each week.

Giving evidence today, he insisted he was still entitled to disability benefits.

He insisted: 'I have to do something with my life, you just can't sit and do nothing.

'You don't know what it is like to live in pain your whole life, my pain is never going to go away. It

doesn't matter what I do, you either do these things or you don't.

'You have to live with it.'

The court heard an investigation into Middleton, from Stanton Drew, Bristol, began after investigators received an anonymous tip off.

Middleton, who takes 39 tablets for his condition, told magistrates his doctor recommended he take up salsa dancing as a hobby.

In 2008 he helped set up a Salsa Bristol, dance company to teach others after training as an instructor.

Middleton told the court: 'The hospital I was going to helped set a goal for me and that was to learn to salsa dance. We were encouraged to do exercise.

'I have nothing to hide whatsoever, my condition is very real.

'I knew I would never be able to be a dancer so I decided to learn to teach. It gave me a lot of friends, it makes you feel like you are alive and have something to do.'

On trial: Wayne Middleton, 48, has denied fraudulently claiming £22,500 in disability benefits at North Somerset Magistrates Court

Middleton was caught showing off his moves on stage when he visited Pontins, in Somerset, for a national salsa conference.

Magistrates were also told that Middleton also undertook a volunteer role at Bristol Zoo to help feed birds one day a week in 2005 - while claiming benefits.

In 2009, Middleton successfully applied for the position of magistrate at Bristol Magistrates Court, overseeing and determining the outcome in hundreds of cases.

He told the court: 'My condition hadn't improved from 1999 and 2003 but it allowed me to fulfill my responsibility as a magistrate.

'Sitting as a magistrate was fantastic, it was one of the proudest achievements of my life.'

And two years later, in 2011, Middleton signed up for Channel Four show Coach Trip, which required participants to undergo strenuous activities.

He was filmed abseiling down a 150ft tower, stilt walking, salsa dancing and tumbling head over heels while grass skiing on the trip to Poland and Slovakia.

Middleton added: 'I had reservations to taking part, they knew my condition.

'I didn't say no to somethings, especially the grass skiing, because I really wanted to do it.'

He insisted that he had informed the job centre of his activities but failed to notify them that Salsa Bristol was making money.

Middleton denies two counts of dishonestly making a false statement to obtain payment between 2005 and 2011.

The trial continues.
