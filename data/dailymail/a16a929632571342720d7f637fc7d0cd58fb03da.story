A primary school teacher has died from a blood clot just four months after she got married.

Helen Thompson, 28, was told she had a clot on her brain, believed to have been caused by the contraceptive pill, and died within 24 hours of being diagnosed.

Her devastated widower, James, from Long Wittenham, Oxfordshire, said they were childhood sweethearts who had met when hey were 12.

'She has been my best friend since I was 12 years old, and my partner since we were 18,' he said.

Newlywed primary school teacher Helen Thompson died weeks after marrying her childhood sweetheart and just hours after discovering she had a deadly blood clot

Mrs Thompson, 28, (pictured with her husband James on their wedding day) was told that she had a clot on her brain - which may have been caused by the contraceptive pill - just four months after she married husband James

Within 24 hours of her diagnosis, the teacher, from Long Wittenham, Oxfordshire, was dead. Her distraught widower James said: 'She has been my best friend since I was 12 years old, and my partner since we were 18'

'The
 doctors said she might have been at a higher risk of a blood clot 
because she was on the pill, but no-one knows for sure what caused it.

'When I left her one day she was fine and the next day she was dead, I still don’t believe it. We had just got married. She left me loving me, wanting me, with me wanting her and loving her. We loved each other so much.'

Mrs Thompson suffered a violent seizure at home after suffering hyper-sensitivity in her feet for several weeks.

After a brain scan on December 11, plans were put in place her to have emergency surgery at Oxford’s John Radcliffe Hospital. But The blood clot had caused a haemorrhage.

Just two hours later, doctors told her family there was nothing more they could do for her and she passed away that day.

Mr Thompson, a bricklayer, said: 'The doctors said they had never 
seen a case like this before. It was just so fast. Because she was on 
the contraceptive pill, she was at a higher risk of clots, but this was 
very rare.

'It was a very scary situation. They hoped they could operate, but it had spread so much it was impossible to do anything. It was just so fast, literally a few hours. She never woke up again.'

The
 childhood sweethearts had married at a festival-style wedding at 
Kingston Bagpuize House, Oxfordshire, in August, just four months before
 her death.

The couple had 
known each other since they were 12, meeting at Wallingford School, and 
were friends until beginning a relationship when they were 18.

Both
 had strong links to the charity International Disaster Volunteers, 
having volunteered for the organisation in Khao Lak in Thailand between 
2005-2006, after the tsunami which devastated the country.

The teacher had been trying to raise a modest £200 for the charity when her life was tragically cut short. Now her family have been left astounded by the amount of money which has been donated in her memory.

In
 the past month, almost £16,000 has been raised on her JustGiving page 
for the charity’s work in helping with the aftermath of Typhoon Haiyan.

Mr Thompson said: 'Helen was such a wonderful person. She was my soulmate and I can’t believe I have lost her.

'I am stunned at how many people have donated money to her charity fund - it feels as though her spirit is being kept alive.

'This can never bring her back, but it means so much.'

A decision has not yet been made by him or IDV about how the money will be spent but it could be used to build a school.

And he said Helen, a teacher at Upper Basildon Primary School, Reading, would have been very proud of what has been achieved.

He said: 'Everyone loved Helen. It has been absolutely mad seeing how it has gone.

'We put a post on Facebook and a link to the site and friends of friends have been sharing it and more money just keeps being raised.'

'She wanted to become a teacher after helping in Thailand, that inspired her to train to be one when she came back. I think it would be really nice to do something like that.'

Andy Chaggars, a founder of IDV, said: 'Helen was such a happy person and when James comes over we are going to look at what we can do with the money. Using the money towards a primary school would be very apt.'
