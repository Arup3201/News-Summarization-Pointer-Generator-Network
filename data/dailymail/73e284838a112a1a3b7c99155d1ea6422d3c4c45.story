The millionaire boss of Ryanair, Michael O’Leary, warned this week that the cost of checking in baggage on one of his flights could go up even further. But that’s not the only way he seeks to squeeze every pound he can out of the 80 million passengers who fly with the airline every year, says DAVID THOMAS.

According to Ryanair, the  so-called ‘ancillary charges’ that pile up on top of the cost of your basic flight ticket contribute an incredible 22 per cent of the company’s revenue — that’s a whopping £836  million: an average of more than £10 per passenger, per flight.

Flying in the face of public opinion: Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary

In 2009, ‘ancillary charges’ generated a mere £512 million, meaning they’ve gone up more than 60 per cent in just three years. At the same rate of growth, Ryanair’s money-making efforts will be taking £1.3 billion extra from passengers’ pockets by 2015.

Ryanair’s Michael O’Leary this week said it’s ‘probably inevitable’ that airlines will charge passengers for carry-on bags. Traditionally, we don’t have to pay for hand luggage, but many airlines are suspected of considering it as a new source of revenue.

Ryanair’s carry-on allowance of a bag with a total volume of no more than 40 litres and a maximum weight of 10kg is already among the smallest in the business. Ryanair, of course, is at the forefront of profit-making when it comes to bags, and has raised its charge for hold luggage by up to £25 over the summer period.

Mr O’Leary said: ‘We don’t want the bags. We will keep increasing charges until we get rid of hold bags.’

Travellers now have to pay up to £160 in the peak season to take two 15kg suitcases on board. As well that punitive charge, it costs up to £60 to carry on sports equipment or musical instruments.

Logical? The more customers O'Leary can cram onto his aeroplanes, the more chance of selling food and drink

Ryanair has abolished check-in desks. Passengers have to do it online and pay £7 per person, per flight to do so. In other words, you’re paying for turning up to catch the flight you’ve already paid for.

The company also charges a 2  per cent surcharge if you book by credit card.

Passengers are forced to pay £70 at the airport if they haven’t already checked in online at home and printed their boarding pass.

And there’s more: if you are late for your flight and have to catch the next one, you’ll be hit with a fee of £110. Maybe at that point you’ll decide it’s easier to get a taxi  — even if you’re heading for the Continent.

That’s the kind of attitude that led Melinda Stevens, editor of Conde Nast Traveller magazine, to declare that ‘engaging with Ryanair is dabbling in the Devil’s work . . . throwing money at him while asking him to repeatedly jab you in the solar plexus with a jagged instrument’.

God forbid that you actually get to sit where you want and with whom you want — at least not without paying for the privilege. If you want priority boarding, making you part of the first group to board the aircraft and thus able to choose your seat, it’s another £7 over the internet, or £10 on  the day. If you want to reserve a place on the plane, that’ll cost you £15.

In for the long haul: O'Leary shows no sign of slowing down as he continues expansion of Ryanair

Ryanair has more than 300 Boeing 737 jets. Always looking to make savings, the company bought half its fleet of aircraft after the 9/11 terrorist attacks, when prices were low.

Once you actually get on one of those planes, you’ll find everything is squeezed to make more profits — and that includes seat space. Last year, a survey of 32 airlines placed it bottom of a table of airlines according to the width of their seats (16in) and last but one for their leg-room (29in).

But as far as O’Leary is concerned, customers are still taking up too much space and demanding too many luxuries.

That’s why he’s talked, not entirely in jest, of charging more for overweight passengers.

He’s also discussed getting Boeing to remove two of the three lavatories on their planes and replace them with six extra seats (as well as threatening to charge up to £1 per visit to the loo on  the plane).

Ryanair already carries the maximum 189 passengers it’s allowed in its aircraft. But O’Leary wants his 737s re-certified to allow him the additional passengers. In the past, he has even suggested removing the last ten rows of seats and letting passengers stand at the back, jammed together like factory-farm chickens.

The more passengers Ryanair can cram in, the more it can soak them for additional charges, and the more it can raise money from other enterprises, such as selling scratchcards to customers, or slapping adverts on the doors of the overhead luggage bins.

It also sells advertising on its website and boarding passes.

And if you’re feeling overheated crammed in with all those other passengers, you can always have an orange juice — if you can spare the £1.80 charge.

Lift off: Ryanair continues to find ways to add more fees to it's 'low fares'

Most airlines want to make it easy for passengers to book a flight, so they provide free smartphone apps. Not Ryanair. Its iPhone app costs £2.49.

And why waste money trying to attract passengers via social media? While most other airlines are desperate to maximise  their exposure on Facebook  and Twitter, Ryanair simply doesn’t bother.

Squeezing every possible passenger on to each flight means more baggage as well. That means more weight, and Ryanair hates weight.

The heavier an aircraft’s load, the more fuel it requires to fly, and aviation fuel is very expensive. T

hat’s why, as it was revealed  this week, O’Leary has ordered  his pilots to fly more slowly — adding two minutes to every Ryanair flight.

Planes, like cars, use less fuel by going slower, so this will save the company £1 per passenger, totalling £80 million a year.
