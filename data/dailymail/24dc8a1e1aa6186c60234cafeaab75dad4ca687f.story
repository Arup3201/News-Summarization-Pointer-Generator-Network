The best friend of the Colorado man who went missing for five days from a Denver Broncos match says he ‘doesn’t like crowds’ and thinks the crowded 76,000 seater stadium caused him to have ‘a nervous breakdown’.

Paul Kitterman was found on Tuesday in Pueblo, Colorado - 112 miles away from the Sports Authority Field at Mile High stadium -  after disappearing at half time from Thursday’s match, leaving his stepson, Jarod Tonneson, and two friends bewildered.

His disappearance sparked a major search and then grave fears for Kitterman's safety. 

Bryan Case, who was known Kitterman for 35 years, says he was very surprised the 53-year-old even agreed to go to the stadium, to attend his first-ever NFL match.

He exclusively told MailOnline: ‘He’s like me, he doesn’t like crowds, he’s never been to a football match and I haven’t either.

‘Something just happened, he snapped. He likes the country, I was surprised he was even at the football.

‘Horse ranching and hunting - that’s what we do, that’s just how we are. We don’t even really know how to use cellphones.

‘He didn’t know who he was. He’d never let nobody down and never do this [knowingly]. I don’t want anybody to think he just wandered off.’

Kitterman’s family released a statement today saying he ‘had some sort of breakdown’ but despite statements he was resting at home, he has actually been hospitalized.

Case added: ‘Right now they are doing CAT scans on him. He’s kind of a little different right now, but he’s started to remember something.

‘He’s doing better, he looked like hell. I think he’s had a breakdown. A nervous breakdown, I don’t know, but he’s not himself.

Safe: Grave concerns were held for the safety of Paul Kitterman after he failed to turn up after Thursday's game. He told police he was looking for a 'warm place' following the match

‘Jarrod is with him and he’s surrounded by friends and family and he’s starting to remember more.

‘I’m just glad he’s alive and getting better. He’s alive and that’s all that matters to me.’

Jarod, Kitterman’s employer at a horse ranch near his home in Kremmling, Colorado, Jay Yust, and his girlfriend, Tia Bakke, had accompanied him to the match and led the frantic search around Denver in the hours after he disappeared.

Once located by police after a tip-off from a local who recognised him, Kitterman said 'he'd had his fill of football' and had been seeking ‘a warm place’.

In his rush to go to the game through a last minute invite he had forgotten to take his credit cards or mobile phone and had only around $50 on him.

Case – who shared a house with Kitterman for six years in Phoenix, Arizona - says his friend’s behavior is incredibly out of character, and he has been on great support to him while he has faced problems over the past year.

A real country man: Friends say Kitterman had never been to an NFL game before and barely knows how to use his cellphone. He spends most of his time outdoors and always has

He said: ‘I see him regularly even though he lives three hours away. I lost my son three months ago and he’s been down here or on the phone almost every day since, speaking to me - he’s really helped me. Through that. Its been a rough year for me too and he’s been the one person I called and cried to.’

‘He’s had a few financial problems and other little things over the years and he’s always come to me, but this time no.

‘You have to know the guy to realise that this is not something he’d just do.’

Denver Police Department have said no foul play is suspected in Kitterman’s disappearance, no charges will not be brought against him and they are glad he is now home and safe.
