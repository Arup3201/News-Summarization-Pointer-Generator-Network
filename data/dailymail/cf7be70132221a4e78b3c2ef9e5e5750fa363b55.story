The wife of 'Great Escaper' D-Day veteran Bernard Jordan has died just days after her husband.

Irene Jordan, 88, died on Tuesday evening, a week after her husband who famously slipped away from his care home to attend last year's 70th anniversary D-Day events in France. 

He died in hospital aged 90  - six months after he captured the nation's hearts when he travelled across the channel to Normandy wearing his war medals and grey mac.

Bernard Jordan, a former Royal Navy officer, married his wife Irene in 1946 - she died a week after him

A statement from Amanda Scott, managing director of Gracewell Healthcare which runs The Pines care home in Hove, East Sussex, where the couple lived, confirmed Mrs Jordan's death.

It said: 'Irene and Bernie will both be much missed by everyone at the home and our thoughts and prayers go out to their friends and family at this sad time.'

Brighton and Hove mayor Brian Fitch paid tribute to Mrs Jordan. He said: 'They were a very close couple who will both be sadly missed.

'Irene went into the care home first after Bernie had looked after her at home, so it came as a bit of a shock that he died first.

'They had been married for more than 50 years and were a devoted couple. After he had gone, she probably gave up the will.

'They were religious people who are now reunited together.'

Bernard Jordan, the 90-year-old war veteran who broke out of his care home in East Sussex to attend the D-Day commemorations in Normandy, France, died last week. His wife Irene died on Tuesday night 

The war hero sparked a nationwide search after escaping from his care home and sneaking to France for the Normandy commemorations. He was later applauded for his escapade and received a welcoming return

Just weeks later, on his 90th birthday, the former Navy officer was inundated with gifts, including more than 2,500 birthday cards from around the world. At the time, he said: 'I'm just one man and I'm nothing special'

Mr Jordan, a Royal Navy veteran and former mayor of Hove, hit headlines around the world when he disappeared from the care home the couple lived in on June 5 last year. 

His whereabouts was only uncovered when a younger veteran phoned later that night to say he had met Mr Jordan and he was safe.  

He was later inundated with more than 2,500 birthday cards following his adventure to Normandy. 

A month after his escapade in France, Mr Jordan was made an honorary alderman of Brighton and Hove during a reception at Brighton Town Hall. 

The honour, which saw him join a select band of more than 30 men and women since 1997, was to mark his 'exceptional contribution to the work of the newly-formed Brighton and Hove Council and the former Hove Borough Council and to the community'. 

A ceremony celebrating Mr and Mrs Jordan's lives will be held at All Saints Church in Hove on January 30 followed by a private funeral, Mr Fitch said.

A minute's silence will be held at the next full meeting of Brighton and Hove City Council to remember the couple.
