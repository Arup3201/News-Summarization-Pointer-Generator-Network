David Gold has blamed jet lag for the Twitter gaffe that saw the West Ham co-chairman 'favourite' a post criticising his club's already under fire manager Sam Allardyce.

Allardyce’s future appeared to be on even thinner ice than it already was after a nightmare pre-season tour of New Zealand ended with losses to Wellington Phoenix and Sydney FC when Gold appeared to endorse a derogatory message about the manager on the social media site.

Gold has now said he inadvertently 'favourited' the tweet but in a series of three tweets clarifying his position he stopped short of an apology to Allardyce.

Not intentional: David Gold favourited the tweet from 'stephen' about sacking Allardyce

'After a 33 hour flight from New Zealand, I was in my car scanning through my tweets and it seems I accidently favourited one,' Gold posted on Tuesday.

'It has made some of the papers today (Tuesday) so I should clarify that I did not and would never deliberately or intentionally endorse a tweet that questions our manager's position. Lesson: don't use twitter when you're jet lagged!'

Allardyce has been made aware of the fact that Gold, who has 92,000 followers on Twitter, was sent a message by a Hammers fan that read: ‘Is today the day we get rid of BFS?? Fingers crossed.’

'BFS' is a derogatory reference to Allardyce and Gold’s decision to ‘favourite’ the message has only intensified the speculation that Allardyce’s time at Upton Park may not last to the start of the season.

Facing the sack: Big Sam might not even make the first game of the season

Divisive: Allardyce wants to move Ravel Morrison on but co-chairman Sullivan wants to offer him a contract

Allardyce,
 who was warned at the end of last season that the owner’s wanted an 
improved style of football, has recently clashed with Gold and the other
 co-chairman David Sullivan over midfielder Ravel Morrison who has become a peripheral figure under Big Sam but who Sullivan wants to offer a new contract.

David Gold's daughter Jacqueline added further intrigue to events at West Ham by tweeting: 'Great to see @davidgold back home after trip to NZ with the team & especially looking forward to the football news at dinner tomorrow night.'

Sullivan has also insisted that the record signing of Andy Carroll was a huge mistake.

The
 striker will miss at least three months of the season with an ankle 
injury and Sullivan revealed that he regretted ‘putting all his eggs in 
one basket’ by signing the England international.

Sullivan also seemed to make Allardyce's position more awkward last week when he revealed the board and the boss were at odds over the future of Ravel Morrison - with the owners wanting to tie the England Under-21 international down on a longer contract despite Allardyce suggesting he does not have a future in his side.
