The Conservative party has bolstered its election war chest by auctioning off Cabinet ministers at their exclusive Black and White Ball.

Super-rich guests at the event in London last night were invited to bid on lots including an Iron Man challenge with Iain Duncan Smith, an early morning jog with Nicky Morgan, shoe shopping with Theresa May and a roast chicken dinner at home with Michael Gove.

Hedge-fund kings, City tycoons and captains of industry were among the 1,100 guests paying between £500 and £1,500 a ticket for the bash at London's Grosvenor House Hotel.

With less than three months until the election, senior Tories hope the event will have raised millions for the campaign to keep David Cameron in Number 10.

Guests at the event included Apprentice star Karren Brady, sex shop queen Jacqueline Gold, her porn baron father David Gold and gentleman's club owner Peter Stringfellow.

They sat at tables alongside senior ministers including Mr Cameron, Defence Secretary Philip Hammond, Education Secretary Mrs Morgan and party chairman Grant Shapps.

Guests were urged to bid on dozens of auction lots. Some were sold in an open auction while others were sold off using machines to silently bid on items.

One of the most eyecatching lots was the chance to join Mr Duncan Smith, a former army officer, in an endurance race.

The glossy auction catalogue included the promise of luxury holidays in the Alps, Barbados and Thailand

There was the promise of a luxury chalet for 12 in Verbier, while a small bronze statue of Baroness Thatcher by Antony Dufort reportedly sold for £210,000

The glossy auction brochure said: 'Feeling adventurous? Join Iain Duncan Smith in this Iron Man-style 'Endeavour'. The 10km course will be action-packed, suitable for endurance race veterans or competitors who are looking for a challenge.

'You will encounter hills, woods, streams, hedges and hay barns as you seek the finish line in a bid to beat your team mate.'

If that sounded a bit too much like hard work, a more gentle 5km run was on offer with Mrs Morgan, dubbed the 'first female Conservative MP to take part in the London Marathon'.

'This is an opportunity to join Nicky for an early morning 5km run. After your run, join Nicky for a hearty breakfast.'

The chance to hit the shops with Mrs May was one of the most highly-prized lots. The glossy brochure stated: 'Merge fashion and politics with the longest serving Home Secretary for 50 years.

'Now is your chance, alongside a friend, to shoe shop in a Bond Street store. Enjoy tea before agreeing on what will best suit your wardrobe.' A £500 shopping voucher was included.

Dinner with the Goves was the offer of a 'hearty weeknight roast chicken dinner on a mutually convenient date'.

Some members of the Cabinet were rather less adventurous. William Hague had signed a cartoon of Margaret Thatcher from 1977.

There was also the promise of dinner with Culture Secretary Sajid Javid at the Carlton Club, a 'unique' bound collection of George Osborne's Budgets signed by 'the man himself' and a copy of the Tory 2015 manifesto signed by Mr Cameron.

Lot Number One was a 'romantic getaway to Santorini with private plane', offering two people a five-night break in a suite with its own private spa at the five star Grace hotel. It sold for £220,000.

Meanwhile, a small bronze statue of Baroness Thatcher by Antony Dufort went for £210,000. A JCB digger reportedly sold for £50,000.

There were luxury stays in villas, ski chalets and hotels, offers of hunting, shooting and fishing and lessons in drumming, singing and cookery.

Guests could also bid for luxury lots including a trip on a private jet to the Greek island of Santorini, a home-cooked dinner from Michelin-starred chef Albert Roux, pheasant shooting for eight people, a private night at Annabel's nightclub, a guided tour of the gardens at the Prince of Wales' Highgrove estate, a personalised composition by Wombles songwriter Mike Batt or a baking masterclass with the creator of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's wedding cake.

A Conservative spokesman said: 'All donations will be declared in the right and proper manner to the Electoral Commission.'

The dress code for the lavish event was 'Winter Cool', with Mr Cameron opting for a lounge suit, rather than black tie, and his wife Samantha, wearing a knee-length cream dress.

Zoe Purvis, a celebrity makeup artist, chaired the dinner's organising committee.

One top table was taken by her multi-millionaire husband Andrew Law, chief executive of Caxton Associates, which uses its £4.5billion hedge fund to bet on international currency movements.

Other guests included Nancy Dell'Olio, who wore eye-catching leopard print shoes, and was accompanied by millionaire businessman Ivan Massow, who is hoping to become the party's 2016 London mayoral candidate.

Miss Gold is most well-known for bringing the Rampant Rabbit to Britain after transforming her father David's business Ann Summers.

They were joined at the party by Apprentice star Karren Brady, who became a Tory peer last year, despite her history working for Mr Gold's sex-obsessed Sport Newspapers.

Also attending was David Sullivan, who made his fortune from porn films, adult magazines and sex shops. 

Party chiefs were hoping to raise up to £3 million from the soiree to help boost their war chest for the general election.

Jonathan Ashworth MP, Labour's Shadow Cabinet Office Minister, said: 'It's no wonder the Tories stand up for a privileged few when their election campaign relies on such an elite few funders.

'Ministers are busy rubbing shoulders with an exclusive network of big money backers rather than delivering for working people.

'As Ministers and tycoons gather tonight to decide how the Tory campaign is going to be funded, families up and down the country are suffering a cost of living crisis to which the Tories have no answers.'
