Jonathan Ridley burst into a betting shop with a knife... but was chased out with a stapler

A robber high on drugs held up a bookies with a kitchen knife - then fled when a female clerk pointed a stapler at him.

Jonathon Ridley, 21, burst into a Betfred shop in Ryton, Gateshead and threatened staff with a knife as he demanded cash.

But when the manager grabbed a stapler and told him to get out, he was taken aback and left without a penny.

Newcastle Crown Court heard how 
Ridley, of Denton View, Winlaton, Gateshead, walked into the betting 
shop at around 7.10pm on July 1 this year.

He
approached the counter where the deputy manager was alone on duty and 
put down the six-inch kitchen knife and a crumpled plastic bag.

He ordered her to 'Fill the bag', and she replied, 'What?'

He repeated his demand but the worker, who had already been held up once before, picked up a stapler and told him to get out.

The court heard how he looked at her in shock before walking out of the shop as she called emergency services.

When he was arrested shortly afterwards, Ridley still had the knife in his jumper.

He told police: 'I did the robbery at the bookies. I was on Ecstasy, I needed the money, I have nowhere to live.'

In a statement to the court earlier 
this week, his victim told how she had been robbed in a shop once before
and the experience left her feeling anxious and insecure.

Nick Peacock, defending, said: 'It is a fairly unsophisticated attempt to rob a bookies.'

He said Ridley had just been released from prison for a separate offence and had nowhere to stay, leaving him desperate for cash.

Ridley was jailed for two years and eight months.

Recorder Jeremy Freedman told him: 'Anyone who goes into a bookies with a knife and demands cash is guilty of very serious criminal behaviour.

'This young lady had the courage to tell you to go away and thankfully you did.'
