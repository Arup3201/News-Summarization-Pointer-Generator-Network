Ryan Bertrand is not sure what more he can do to earn an England recall.

The 25-year-old left Chelsea in search of regular first-team football in the summer, joining Southampton on a season-long loan with a view to a permanent move.

It has proved an excellent decision, with Bertrand's fine form key to Saints confounding the doubters with an extraordinary start to the campaign.

Ronald Koeman's side have the best defensive record in English football and sit second in the Premier League heading into the international break - a period the left-back will spend at the club's New Forest training base.

Bertrand has again been overlooked by Roy Hodgson for England's upcoming matches and is not sure what more he can do to impress the man who gave him his only two senior caps in 2012.

'It will be quiet here these next two weeks, but it's a chance for those of us who are left out, like me, to work on things and come back flying again,' he said.

'Yeah, [I'm] very [disappointed]. I've started very well this season, we're second in the league, so I don't know what the criteria is to get in there at the minute.'

Missing out will no doubt be all the more galling to Bertrand given Saints team-mates Nathaniel Clyne and Fraser Forster have been deemed worthy of call-ups.

Asked if he feels he will get another chance with England if he keeps performing, he said: 'Yeah, definitely. That's what I thought. But, at the end of the day, it's not down to me.

'I feel like I should have achieved that already, so hopefully it will come.'
