When two Norwegian fishermen, Svein Aasjord and Trond Ivarjord set out on a trip last weekend, they did not expect to see what they did. 

Standing on the edge of their small fishing boat on 8 November, tucked between the scenic mountains of Troms, the two men were fishing for herring.

But, their trip took a surprising turn as they came within an arm's length encounter of a pod of humpback whales.

Their camera recording showed the first hand account, complete with their understandably shocked reactions.

The calm waters start to ripple as the humpback whales approach the boat. 

In the blink of an eye, the whales emerge from the icy depths, their flippers slicing through the churning waves.

The fishermen are within an arm's length of the magnificent creatures as they surge to the surface,

Their awe at the incredible sight can be heard in their voices, as they chatter excitedly in Norwegian.

'This can get close,' one voice is heard saying as the whales jumps out of the water with a big splash.

'I don't want to get any closer than that,' the voice is also heard remarking

'I don't want to be any closer than that,' they add.

Luckily for them the whales do not decide to investigate the humans. 

Instead they disappear as swiftly as they appeared, leaving the body of water calm but for a few gentle ripples.

Troms is a county in northern Norway, the second largest north of the Arctic Circle.
