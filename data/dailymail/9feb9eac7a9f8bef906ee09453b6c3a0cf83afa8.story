West Ham winger Taylor Tombides made a touching tribute to his brother and former Hammers' striker Dylan on Saturday, by dedicating his first goal of pre-season to him.

The 18-year-old, who is part of the Premier League side's development squad, dedicated his goal against AFC Hornchurch to Dylan, who died in April at the age of 20 following a three-year battle with testicular cancer.

Days after Dylan's tragic death Taylor revealed a tattoo in memory of him, and it was this that the midfielder kissed immediately after putting West Ham ahead on Saturday.

Taylor scored the Hammers' second goal in
 a 2-2 draw, composing himself in front of goal to slot under the 
onrushing goalkeeper and restore West Ham's lead before their opponents equalised through George Purcell.

His brother Dylan, who passed away in April, made his Hammers first-team debut two years ago.

Dylan was first diagnosed with cancer while representing Australia during the 2011 U17 World Cup in Mexico.

Dylan was regarded as one of the most exciting young players to come
 out of Australia after signing with West Ham as a 14-year-old.

After being diagnosed he battled back to 
make his first-team debut off the substitutes' bench in a League Cup 
match against Wigan in 2012.

His death in April was marked by a minute's applause before West Ham's home match against Crystal Palace.

West Ham added in a club statement: 'Dylan's amazing resilience and positivity saw him through months of surgery and chemotherapy, while his outstanding talent saw him make his first-team debut in a League Cup tie with Wigan Athletic at the Boleyn Ground in September 2012.

'Away from the pitch, Dylan did a huge amount of work to raise awareness of male cancer, supporting the One for the Boys campaign at a number of high-profile events alongside the likes of Hollywood star Samuel L Jackson, snooker star Jimmy White and fellow Australian Peter Andre.

'Dylan was respected by everyone who knew
 him for his intelligent views on the game and his larger than life 
character. He was a loving son, amazing brother and well-respected 
member of the West Ham squad. He will be hugely missed by everyone who 
had the honour of knowing him.

'His passing will be marked by a 
minute's applause ahead of Saturday's Barclays Premier League fixture 
with Crystal Palace at the Boleyn Ground. The Hammers' players will also
 wear black armbands in his memory.

'The
 thoughts of everyone associated with the club are with his parents 
Tracylee and Jim, brother Taylor, his family and friends at this sad 
time.

'The club request that their privacy is now respected and they are allowed to grieve their much loved son and brother in peace.'
