Brad Barritt may be recovering numerous injuries sustained in England's victory over Australia but the centre still took time out to attend the 2014 ICAP Charity Day.

The event, which raises money for numerous causes, was attended by a host of celebrities, but none in worse condition than Barritt.

The 28-year-old played a key role as Stuart Lancaster's side defeated the Wallabies 26-17 at Twickenham on Saturday.
