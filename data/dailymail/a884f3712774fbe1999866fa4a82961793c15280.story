Tom Huddlestone is in his prime footballing years and has plenty of time left on the field - yet the Hull City midfielder is already plotting his future.

The 27-year-old is desperate to move into management once he hangs up his boots and has started work early on achieving his coaching badges.

Having previously completed his UEFA B coaching licence in the summer, Huddlestone is already more than halfway towards securing the A badge.

The Hull City midfielder is determined to achieve his badges before he hangs up his playing boots

Quoted in the Daily Star, the former Tottenham Hotspur midfielder said: 'Hopefully I've still got a few years left playing but it's better to have it.

'It's (coaching) something I would like to do in the future and I didn't have much planned in the summer, so it was ideal to get it started.

'It's easier to get the badges while you're still playing, rather than be out of the game for four or five years and suddenly decide you want to get them because a few of your ideas might have been lost.

'While you still have fresh ideas and ways of playing, I think it's a good idea to get them done.'

Huddlestone, who began his career at Derby County and also spent a season on loan at Wolverhampton Wanderers, has represented England at every level from Under 16 through to the senior squad.

He has not made an England appearance since 2012, however.

The Nottingham-born midfielder has made 369 career club appearances, scoring 20 times.

Huddlestone was booked during Hull City's 0-0 draw against Liverpool at Anfield last weekend
