The east London club have been under immense pressure from disgruntled supporters to sack under-fire Allardyce.

The 59-year-old has successfully steered the club to top-flight security after a difficult start to the season.

But a growing contingent of supporters have turned on the former Bolton boss, despite the team's improvement since the start of 2014.

Allardyce's tactics have become a major bone of contention among Hammers fans, and the anger towards the manager from supporters has not gone unnoticed within the corridors of power at Upton Park.

And those dissenting voices have pushed the club into taking the decision to axe Allardyce.Â Work has already begun on identifying Allardyce's replacement.

Allardyce has remained bullish about his job prospects in recent weeks despite the unrest; and has continued with his plans for next season.

The manager led a strategic planning meeting on Thursday, where various issues including player recruitment and retention were discussed.

But behind the scenes, plans were being already made for life without the former Newcastle manager.

Sections of the Upton Park faithful have been vociferous in their condemnation of Allardyce.

A survey of 12,392 Hammers fans taken last month saw 77.95 percent vote in favour of Allardyce leaving the East London club this summer.

He was booed by home fans after the final whistle of March's clash against Hull despite winning the match 2-1.
