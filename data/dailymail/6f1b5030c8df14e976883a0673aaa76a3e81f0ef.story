After suffering several soggy summers, it is not the news we were hoping for.

Met Office experts who got together to discuss recent unusual weather patterns predicted yesterday that Britain faces a decade of wet summers.

They blame natural warming in the Atlantic for pushing a current of fast-flowing air in the upper atmosphere, known as the jet stream, further south.

Six out of the last seven UK summers 
have seen above average rainfall - with just 2010 the exception. It is 
thought that long-term Atlantic currents could be playing an important 
role.

Weather and 
climate experts from across the UK, who met at the Met 
Office’s HQ in Exeter today to discuss the recent run of unusual seasons
in Europe, warned that as these operate on cycles of a decade or more, 
we could experience sodden summers for 'years to come'.

However, all is not lost as while these influence the odds of wet summers, it doesn’t rule out the possibility of bouts of sunshine and fine weather over the next few years  - starting with tomorrow, when Britain is expected to bask in its hottest day of the year.

Temperatures will reach a high of 26C (78F) today before possibly hitting 30C (86F) tomorrow.

But
high humidity means many areas could see rain and thunderstorms 
tomorrow morning and evening and sunshine struggling to break through 
the cloud.

Experts from the Universities of Exeter, Leeds, Oxford, Reading and Imperial College London, as well as the Met Office, attended today's summit.

They met to discuss weather patterns and
their potential causes in three recent seasons – the cold winter of 
2010/11, the wet summer of 2012, and this year’s cold spring.

Professor Stephen Belcher, Head of the Met Office Hadley Centre and chair of the meeting, said: 'Ultimately what we’ve seen in each of these seasons is shifts in the position of the jet stream which impact our weather in certain ways at different times of year.

'The key question is what is causing the jet stream to shift in this way? There is some research to say some parts of the natural system load the dice to influence certain states of the jet stream, but this loading may be further amplified by climate change.'

Brendan Jones, senior forecaster at MeteoGroup, the weather division of the Press Association,
said tomorrow's warm weather was being carried by warm air coming up from the 
Continent, with Germany, France and the Low Countries seeing 
temperatures soar past 30C (86F) in the past few days.

'It does look as if today and tomorrow are going to be very warm,' he said.

'I think today will be the hottest day of the year and tomorrow will break that again.'

Temperatures should be high across England and Wales, with the South East seeing the highest temperatures, he said.

Because of the large amount of cloud, they are likely to hit a high of around 28C (82F) tomorrow, but any areas lucky enough to have sunshine all day may see temperatures hitting 29C (84F) or 30C (86F).

Further north, temperatures will remain lower, and they will fall back to the low 20Cs from Thursday, Mr Jones said.

The welcome warm blast follows what the Met Office said was the coldest spring since 1962, with a mean temperature across March, April and May of 6C (43F), 1.7C below the long-term average.

Weather and climate experts from across the UK went to the Met Office’s HQ in Exeter today for a workshop to discuss the recent run of unusual seasons in Europe.

A total of 25 delegates attended including representatives from the Universities of Exeter, Leeds, Oxford, Reading and Imperial College London, as well as the Met Office.

Workshops of this kind are held on a regular basis on a great deal of issues across weather and climate science.

Today’s included sessions which looked at the strange weather patterns and their potential causes in three recent seasons – the cold winter of 2010/11, the wet summer of 2012, and this year’s cold spring.

Professor Stephen Belcher, head of the Met Office Hadley Centre and chair of the meeting, said: 'Ultimately what we’ve seen in each of these seasons is shifts in the position of the jet stream which impact our weather in certain ways at different times of year.

'The key question is what is causing the jet stream to shift in this way?

'There is some research to say some parts of the natural system load the dice to influence certain the jet stream, but this loading may be further amplified by climate change.'

There are a number of possible factors which could be ‘loading the dice’, including declining Arctic sea ice, solar variability and long-term ocean cycles.

The workshop focused on the latest research looking at how these drivers can influence weather patterns and discussed future research can be targeted to push forward understanding in this area.

There are a wide range of factors that could be causing the cold winters such as changes in the Arctic climate.

Dr James Screen, from the University of Exeter, said: 'There has been a lot of talk about declining Arctic sea ice playing a role in our weather patterns, but really that’s just one aspect of changes in the Arctic climate – which has seen rapid warming compared to other parts of the world.

'Those changes mean there is less of a difference in temperature between the Arctic and tropics, which could impact the position of the jet stream.'

Another driver of colder winter weather has already been identified and is known as Sudden Stratospheric Warmings (SSWs).

Recent research in this area has meant the Met Office was able to give good advice up to a month ahead on cold spells in recent seasons when they have been driven by this phenomenon.

Professor Belcher said: 'This workshop has looked at some really cutting edge research and helped us identify key areas for future work to improve our understanding of potential drivers of some of the unusual seasons we have seen.

'This work will help us continue our work to push forward understanding in this area so we can give better forecasts and advice on longer timescales in the future.'Source: Met Office
