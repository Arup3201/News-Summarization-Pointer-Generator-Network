A 41-year-old mother of three accused of killing her husband  has had her murder retrial delayed because she has gotten pregnant through IVF.

Julie Harper was acquitted on October 2nd of  gunning down her spouse of 11 years, Jason Harper, 39, in the couple's home in Carlsbad, California, in August 2012 as their three children watched cartoons upstairs.

A judge declared a mistrial after the jury came back deadlocked, but had leaned towards a lesser charge of second degree murder. 

Her new trial was set for April 15, but her due date is May 12 and, because doctors believe it is high risk pregnancy, they urged a judge on Monday to delay it.

Pushed back: Julie Harper was acquitted on October 2nd of murdering her husband of 11 years, Jason Harper, 39, in 2012. Her retrial has been delayed because she is expecting a baby 

Vista Superior Court Judge Blaine K. Bowman agreed to push it back to September 8, starting with jury selection.

However, according to the San Diego Reader, prosecutors are suspicious that it was an IVF pregnancy, claiming that a 'neighbor witness' saw 'a man in his underwear staying in the master bedroom' around six months ago.

They said: 'Once again, Defendant is engaging in a disturbing manipulation of our criminal justice system.' 

Prosecutor Keith Watanabe told the court that Harper has a new 'lover and fiance', who she described as the 'love of her life' in a letter written 17 days after her husband was shot. 

They have asked the judge to question this man.

A week before the killing, the jury in the initial trial heard Mrs Harper filed for divorce and allegedly forged her husband's signature so she could withdraw $20,000 from two bank accounts and their daughter's college fund. 

Allegations: A judge declared a mistrial after the jury came back deadlocked, but they had leaned towards a lesser charge of second degree murder. During that case the defense contested Harper (left) was abused by her teacher husband of ten years (right)

During her first trial, Harper testified that she was afraid of her husband and that he repeatedly 'raped' her.

She portrayed herself as a victim of domestic and sexual abuse at the hands of her husband, and insisted that she fired the fatal shot in self-defense. 

But  Watanabe challenged Harper's claims, saying that she had prepared for the final showdown with her husband by packing a ‘getaway bag’ and putting inside passports for herself and her children

They have aso alleged that 52 prescription bottles were located in the same room where the deceased husband was found, and those medications included Oxycontin, Oxydocone, Hydrocodone, Valium, and Morphine.

At the new trial, if Harper is convicted of second-degree murder, she could face between 40 years and life in prison.
