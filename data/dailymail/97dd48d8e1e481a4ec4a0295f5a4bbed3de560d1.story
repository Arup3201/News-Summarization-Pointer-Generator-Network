Roy Hodgson has admitted he is prepared to wait until after Euro 2016 before the FA make a decision on his future.

The England coach, 67, will be out of contract after the tournament but doesn’t expect talks to begin before they travel to France.

Leighton Baines was the first current England player to stress that he would like to see Hodgson remain in the job beyond the Euros.

Hodgson said: ‘It's nice for him to say that, but 2016 is my focus. My concentration is 100% on that. There's plenty of time. 

‘I'm not desperate to have my future secured. I've had a long time behind me, and my future is a lot shorter than my past.

Everton defender Leighton Baines has expressed that he would like Hodgson to stay as England manager

‘I'm more than happy with our situation at the moment. If the day comes when a contract is discussed, I'll think about it then. 

‘I would be happy for it to be sorted at end of Euro 2016. I'm very happy with the support I get from the people in the Association, and to work with the players. ‘I'm happy with that. At 67, let's be happy with that.’
