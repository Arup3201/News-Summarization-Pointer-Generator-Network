News of Allesandra Pacchieri, the Italian woman whose baby delivered by caesarean section without her consent and then removed from her by Essex social services has shocked the nation over the past week.

Ms Pacchieri was admitted to a psychiatric hospital in the UK while here for a training course. Her lawyers have launched a legal action in a bid to try to get her daughter back and have said the mother-of-three suffers from a relatively minor mental illness, a bipolar condition that can be treated with medication.

Someone who sympathises all too well with the unimaginable pain of having your child taken from you is Kelly McWilliams,who last year had a similar experience. Her baby was removed at birth by social workers because she had previously suffered from depression

Ultimately it took Kelly over four months to get baby Victoria back after she was taken with no warning just hours after her birth

Although she has now been reunited her daughter Victoria, Kelly, 37, said on This Morning
 that that she was left devastated when social services turned up out of
 the blue to take away her baby while she was actually in labour.

Kelly had struggled with with depression after the death of her 10-year-old son.She became so unwell that she admitted herself voluntarily to a psychiatric hospital, where, with excellent care, she recovered.

‘I was at my worst it was such a dark period for me. I admitted myself to hospital because I didn’t know what else I could do. 

'I found living without my son very hard so I did self-admit myself to the psychiatric ward. The treatment there was fantastic. It was the best thing I could have ever done.

‘When I left I knew my life had to change. I wanted help and I wanted to get better for my children’s sake.

I saw a mental health worker every week for a year, then every two weeks for a following year. It was mainly just for support, to make sure I didn’t slip and it just lifted me up and up and up.

‘I have never been as strong as I am now. I have no depression at all.’

At the end of December 2011, having been trying for a second child, Kelly was delighted to learn that she was pregnant.

‘I was so happy,’ Kelly says, ‘It was obviously the best thing that had happened to us since our son had died so you can’t imagine the feeling that you can make a future again and to start living for the future and not the past anymore.’

However her joy at greeting her new arrival was curtailed when, in August 2011, social workers enter her hospital room while she was in the middle of giving birth. 

Kelley spoke out about her experience on This Morning, saying that while she was reunited with Victoria, other families may still be suffering an unfair separation

‘They arrived very coldly, knocked on the door and walked straight in.’

Clearly becoming emotional as she recalls the traumatic event Kelly explains: ‘They said to me “Kelly we’re here because you’re not very well and we are going to be placing your baby into foster care two hours after you give birth”

‘I thought it was a joke. I stood there with my mouth open. I couldn’t believe it.'

When she asked why Kelly was told simply that she was ‘not well’ and that she had failed to attend a CBT (cognitive behavioural therapy) appointment the previous year.

This was despite the fact that the CBT appointment had been booked by Kelly herself in an effort to help her overcome a fear of spiders.

Having admitted her history of depression at her first antenatal appointment Kelly saw a social worker just once when she was 6 months pregnant, and was told everything was fine.

Baby Victoria suffered breathing difficulties when she was born and so was taken straight to Neonatal Intensive Care, from which she was taken by social services. Kelly was not allowed to leave the ward during this time and didn't see her baby.

Having secured a lawyer from her hospital bed while in labour, Kelly found herself in court fighting for the right to keep her own child just two days after giving birth.

‘I feel I had to do everything to get her back. At first they only asked for my medical records to prove I wasn’t suffering with depression, then they wanted a psychiatrist’s report. I knew that would be fine and then they said they wanted a psychologists report.

‘When that was fine they started to bring my disability into it. I was made to stand in front of them and wash a doll to prove I could do it.’

Ultimately it took Kelly over four months to get baby Victoria back.

Kelley says when  the social workers entered the hospital room when she was in labour she originally thought it was a joke

‘I got her back after four months and even thought that was a very long time for me there are other families out there for who it has taken years.

‘It takes time and that is what’s so hard. They set the court dates and you can’t bring them forward.

‘They were worried it would cause my depression again but if anything it gave me more fight; I’d lost one there was no way I was going to lose another.

They set these timescales but what they don’t realise is that when it’s innocent people it’s breaking the family apart. You can’t do it to the parents and you can’t do it to the children.

The stress of the separation and fight to get Victoria back caused the breakdown of Kelly’s marriage.

Despite the devastating effect of the incident on Kelly and her family, she does acknowledge the difficult situation social workers are in.

However she says: ‘Children can’t be put at risk, but innocent people can’t be put at risk. There are just too many mistakes happening.’
