An actor who appeared in Doctor Who and Casualty was battered to death by a jealous love rival, a court heard today.

Father-of-two Gary Suller, 45, was murdered in a bitter love triangle over Katie Gilmore, 27, who he planned to marry, Cardiff Crown Court was told.

But Barry Bowyer, 38, was also seeing Miss Gilmore and 'hated' Mr Suller because he was afraid of losing her to him, prosecutors said.

He allegedly broke into Mr Suller's terraced house in Pontnewydd, south Wales, and lay in wait for him to come home.

The court heard Bowyer then punched and kicked his love rival to death in a 'savage and bloody' attack.

Prosecutor Peter Davies said: 'Barry Bowyer and Gary Suller were not strangers to each other - they where both in love with the same woman.

'Bowyer contemplated, planned and carried out an attack at the home of a man he detested.

'He laid in wait for Gary to come home before commencing a savage and bloody attack on the helpless man.

'It was a prolonged, unrelenting and brutal attack where he inflicted gross and fatal injuries..

Mr Suller, who was divorced, appeared in Doctor Who, Casualty and other television dramas, often as a policeman or prison officer. He also had a small part in the Rhys Ifans film Mr Nice.

The court heard he was 'besotted' with Miss Gilmore even though friends warned him to stay away.

Mr Davies said: 'He was infatuated 
with her, he sent her flowers and texts, and she would regularly stay at
his small terraced house.

'Katie has said: "He was totally besotted with with me, he loved me and wanted to marry me."

'They even went to a registry office to announce their intention to get married but the wedding never went ahead.'

Miss Gilmore met Bowyer just a few weeks after the registry office visit, the court was told.

Mr Davies said: 'Friends say it appeared Katie was flitting between Gary and Barry. But Bowyer was stressed out about it and started to become more possessive.

He started to say he hated Gary, he said he wanted Katie to himself and no one was going to get in the way of that. He told Katie that if she didn’t get rid of Gary then he would.

'Katie said: "He knew my only escape was Gary and he hated him for that."'

Mr Gilmore was found dead with 'grotesque injuries' at his three-bedroomed home.

Bowyer allegedly ransacked the house stealing DVDs and a flatscreen TV, which he loaded into Gary’s car before escaping.

Bowyer, of Croesyceiliog, near Cwmbran, denies murder but admits burglary and manslaughter claiming he killed Gary in a 'momentarily lapse'.

The trial continues.
