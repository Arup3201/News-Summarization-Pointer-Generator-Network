Stuart Hogg has been warned he may provoke a furious England backlash at Twickenham after suggesting Scotland’s Calcutta Cup rivals do not respect them as a rugby nation.

While Stuart Lancaster, who represented Scotland at age-group level, dismissed any notion that his team will take Saturday’s RBS 6 Nations visitors lightly, Hogg’s incendiary remarks to Sportsmail drew a stern response north of the border.

Former Lions prop Peter Wright accused the full-back of a ‘misjudgment’ in making what amounted to a familiar claim of English arrogance.

‘Under previous England coaches maybe there was a lack of respect for Scottish rugby but under Stuart Lancaster that has changed,’ said Wright.

‘He always gives respect to the opposition. The England lads will be angry to be accused of not respecting Scottish rugby because they do and that could fire them up even more.’

Wright’s comments followed a Twitter reaction to Hogg’s outburst by Will Carling, who said: ‘I always thought you earned respect through your performances. Old fashioned I know…’

His point was a clear reference to the fact that Scotland have failed to win at Twickenham for 32 years.

Wright added: ‘Will Carling has every right to suggest respect has to be earned by Scotland. He is a former England captain who led them to three Grand Slams, played in a World Cup final and went on tour with the Lions, so he has every right to take issue with Hogg.

‘I am surprised Stuart said it in the first place and I hope he isn’t made to regret his comments by an England side that will respect Scotland on Saturday but may now want to beat them even more.’ There was a more measured response from within the Scotland camp yesterday.

Assistant coach Matt Taylor added: ‘I don’t see a lack of respect at all. Under Stuart Lancaster they are quite a humble group and they will be taking us seriously.’

Lancaster said: ‘We have a healthy regard for their team, their players and their coaching team.’

England have been forced to rule out Brad Barritt (ankle), Tom Croft (shoulder) and Henry Thomas (shoulder) from the rest of the championship. 

Exeter’s Henry Slade has been called into the squad and while he may push Billy Twelvetrees for a bench place, he is being viewed as a rising World Cup candidate. Luther Burrell and Mike Brown are expected to start against Scotland.
