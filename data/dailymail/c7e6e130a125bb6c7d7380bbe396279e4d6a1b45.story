Stuart Lancaster is refusing to 'dream' of seeing his England team crowned RBS 6 Nations champions for the first time on Saturday night.

The Red Rose have been installed as favourites to replace Ireland as champions on a climatic final round that will conclude with France visiting Twickenham, yet they could finish as low as fourth in the table.

Ireland and Wales are also in the hunt with the staggered kick-offs - starting in Rome at 12.30pm and concluding when England take the field at 5pm - ensuring a nerve-jangling afternoon awaits.

For a third successive year the title is set to be decided by points difference with England's cushion over the Irish of plus four placing them in pole position, although they arguably have the toughest fixture, even allowing for France's dismal record at Twickenham.

Lancaster is desperate to lift the first piece of major silverware of his reign but having finished runners-up for the last three years, the head coach is acutely aware of how best laid plans can be foiled.

'To win at Twickenham would mean a huge amount, - for the players and the fans,' he said.

'I know how much hard work people have put in and also how much it hurt to come second for three years in a row.

'But you can't start thinking about things like that until you get the detail of the game right. We've got a huge challenge coming our way from France.

'They're a high quality team - very big and physical. As they showed last year when they played Ireland, they played right through for the full 80 in that last game even though they couldn't win the Championship.

'It could still be the case they have something to play for, so we won't start dreaming yet, we'll get our detail right.'

England head into the final weekend of the Six Nations atop the table on points difference

The schedule has presented England with the significant advantage of knowing exactly what their target will be against France when the last game of the 2015 Six Nations kicks off.

Lancaster will inform his players of the results of Wales' clash with Italy in Rome and Ireland's match against Scotland at Murrayfield, but insists their over-riding ambition on must be to secure victory rather than chase a score.

'There are lots of hypotheticals. You don't know how the other two games will play out. Clearly we'll know the outcome before we start, which is an advantage on last year,' he said.

'We were in a similar position going into the Italy game last year when we knew points difference would decide it. The challenge for us was to score as many points as we could.

'The emphasis on Saturday will be the same as that day - to get the performance right first and foremost.

'It's impossible to insulate the players from the results of the previous games because 82,000 people are shouting it at them when they run on to the field.

'But the critical thing is to ensure the players are all completely focussed on their own preparations leading into the game.

'By the time the Ireland game finishes we'll know what the objective is and will feed that through to the key decision-makers.

'Everyone else should be concentrating on their job to get a win for the team.'
