A cramped beach hut with no running water or mains electricity has been put on the market for an astonishing £150,0000.

The
 one room 'shed' on Mudeford Spit near Christchurch in Dorset is just 10 feet
 by 15 feet and can only be accessed by boat from nearby Christchurch Quay or on a novelty land train from the nearest car park at Hengistbury Head. 

Even then, the owners 
will face a half-a-mile trek after the boat or train ride to reach the four-walled hut that is positioned 
at the very end of the sandy peninsula.

This tiny beach hut on Mudeford Spit in Christchurch, Dorset with no running water or mains electricity has been put up for sale for £150,000

The hut's only electricity comes from solar panels on the roof that power 
the lighting. A cooker and small fridge run off a camping gas bottle.

There is no toilet either but there is a shared shower block on the sandy spit.

The agent marketing the property say four people can sleep in hut but between March and October only, due to a local bylaw.

Not
 only that, the buyer will have to stump up £3,000 a year in ground rent
 to the local council, as well as £500 in annual rates.

The cooker and fridge in the kitchen of the beach hut run off a small camping gas bottle as there is no mains electricity connected to it

The agent marketing the property says it can accommodate up to four people but they can only stay overnight from March to October, due to a local bylaw

Mudeford Spit near Christchurch in Dorset is home to around 350 beach huts looking out across Christchurch harbour

The
 enormous asking price is equivalent to a top of the range Bentley 
Continental car and even a four-bedroomed terraced house in Thornaby, 
Stockton-on-Tees.

The shed also measures in at £1,000 per sqaure foot, the same as a property in central London's Pimlico area.

Andy
 Denison, of Denisons Estate Agents in Christchurch, who is selling the 
leasehold for hut number 17, said: 'This beach hut is more towards the 
quieter quayside-end of the sandspit facing 'the run', the stretch of 
water between the spit and Mudeford.

The small shed includes a kitchen and two beds but has no toilet or running water and those staying there must use the shared shower block

Mudeford Spit where the beach is located, is only accessible by taking a boat from Christchurch Quay or a land train from a nearby car park

There are around 350 beach huts located on Mudeford Spit, with one earlier this year being snapped up for £180,000

'It has lovely views over Christchurch harbour and across to Avon beach.

'The hut is not huge but it's quite nicely done out with a little kitchenette and two sofa beds so you can sleep four people.

'You can only sleep there between March and October, but you can visit any time of the year.

The asking price of £150,000 for the hut is also the same as a four-bedroomed terraced house in Stockton-on-Tees, left, or a Bentley Continental, right

'The cooker and the fridge both run off a camping gas bottle and the lights are powered by a battery.

'Water
 is from a stand pipe and on about four occasions a year the spit is 
opened up to vehicles so owners can move things in and out.

'It
 sounds like a lot of money for what is effectively a shed but they are 
in such demand that the bigger huts can sell for upwards of £200,000.'

Last year, a similar beach hut on Mudeford Spit was sold by Sarah Litchfield for £180,000 within days of going on the market. The 12 by 18 foot hut was said to boast priceless views over the The Solent towards the Isle of Wight.

In 2012, another hut in the same area sold for a £170,000 in just two days of going on the market. The wooden structure was subject to a bidding frenzy as people as tried to get their hands on one of the most sought after properties.  

Builder Nick Willan, 56, also spent a staggering £189,000 on a decaying Victorian toilet block which had been left to rot on the seafront in Sheringham, Norfolk. 

He presented the renovated property - dubbed 'The Wee Retreat' - to his wife, Sue, as an anniversary present.

Steve
 Barratt, chairman of the Mudeford Sandbank Beach Hut Association, 
added: 'The huts at that end of the spit go for a bit less because of 
the hike you face from the jetty or the land train station, especially 
if you have luggage.

'But the whole thing is market driven and there is always a demand for these huts.

'Despite its remoteness, hundreds of people from the mainland come across every day during the summer months.'
