Back again: Diallo Allen, 18, was initially allowed to walk free by Judge Lesley Newton, who said she believed there was 'another side' to him

A 'middle-class’ mugger raided a house only three days after he was spared jail by a judge who took pity on him because his family had fallen on hard times.

Diallo Allen, 18, was allowed to walk free despite mugging three teenagers after Judge Lesley Newton heard he turned to crime after his affluent parents were forced to move to a council estate.

Judge Newton said she believed there was ‘another side’ to the violent mugger and gave him a suspended sentence.

But three days later Allen smashed his way into a home while the owners were on holiday. He was caught after traces of his blood were found on a door and window frames.

Local councillor Norman Lewis condemned the judge’s decision to spare Allen jail, saying that he should have been made to take responsibility for his criminal actions.

‘People’s homes are their own Shangri-Las and it’s unacceptable to come home to find that somebody has been through their property,’ he said.

‘The judge needs to reflect on her decision to suspend the sentence.’

On January 23, Allen was given the suspended sentence for stealing an iPhone, a BlackBerry and a bag worth £800 from three teenagers in Chorlton, Greater Manchester.

Manchester Crown Court was told how he had fallen into bad company after his ‘high-achieving’ family moved a mile-and-a-half from a ‘middle-class’ area to the Nell Lane council estate, in Chorlton.

Allen’s mother, Deanne Blake, had worked for Manchester council for 18 years as a social worker before launching her own private consultancy.

His father Garfield Allen, who is separated from Miss Blake, was made redundant from his job as a theatre director due to funding cuts in the arts.

From the old: Allen used to live with his parents on the upmarket Stratton Road in Chorlton, Greater Manchester, which has an average price of £210,000, before the recession forced them out

To the new: Financial difficulties meant Allen's family had to move 1.5 miles away to Ploughbank Drive on the Nell Lane estate, which has an average house price of £100,000

Before the change in their fortunes 
Allen had enjoyed an ‘affluent, middle-class lifestyle’ living on a road
where the average house price is around £200,000.

But in 2010, he was forced to move to the Nell Lane estate, where the average house costs around £100,000.

'What a joke!'

Manchester United goalkeeper Sam Johnstone's response to initial sentence

Sentencing him for the mugging, Judge 
Newton said: ‘If I send you to prison I fear your life will spiral 
downwards – I have persuaded myself it’s not appropriate to send you to 
prison.’

Allen was given a 15-month suspended prison term.

Following the judge’s decision, 
Manchester United reserve goalkeeper Sam Johnstone revealed that one of 
Allen’s victims was his girlfriend Bryony Turner, who had her designer 
handbag and purse stolen.

Johnstone tweeted: ‘What a joke!! The 
guy who mugged my gf while I was in China on tour let off. That bag and 
purse was expensive!’

Fury: After the initial case was reported, Manchester United reserves goalkeeper Sam Johnstone tweeted (right) that one of the victims was his girlfriend - calling the sentence a 'joke'. Days after, Allen went through a property looking for things to steal but found nothing to take, Manchester Magistrates’ Court (left) heard

Miss Turner also took to the social 
networking site, saying: ‘Ridiculous excuse in my eyes after what he put
me through. These people need to be off the streets.’

Allen is now due to appear before 
Judge Newton again, after yesterday pleading guilty to burgling the 
house with intent to steal.

He burgled the property on January 26 causing £600 worth of damage but left empty-handed.

The court heard that the house was 
only a couple streets away from the area where he lived with his parents
before the recession forced them out.

Allen is due to be sentenced later this month.
