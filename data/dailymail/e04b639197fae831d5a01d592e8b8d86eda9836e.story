Robin van Persie will be fit to face Manchester City in next week's derby despite being taken off on a stretcher during Manchester United's win over Olympiacos on Wednesday night.

The Dutchman was the hero as he scored a hat-trick to guide his side to a 3-0 win and a 3-2 aggregate victory against their Greek opponents, but his night was cut short in the closing stages after a challenge by Olympiacos defender Kostas Manolas.

Manager David Moyes said after the match that the injury wasn't as bad as first feared. And while he remains a doubt for United's Premier League clash against West Ham, Sportsmail understands the striker will be ready for the visit of Manchester City on Tuesday.

Van Persie will have further checks on 
his back injury later on Thursday but the early signs that he will be 
fit to line up against City are very encouraging.

Speaking to Sky Sports after seeing his side progress to the quarter-finals, Moyes said: ‘It (the injury) doesn't look that bad. It may have been just a knee in the back.'

Van Persie opened the scoring in the 25th minute when he smashed home a penalty after he was fouled by Jose Holebas.

The
 Dutchman then converted Wayne Rooney's low cross in first-half injury 
time to double United's lead on the night and draw them level on 
aggregate at 2-2.

Van Persie's hat-trick was complete when he wrong-footed Olympiacos goalkeeper Jimenez Gago with a free-kick in the 52nd minute.

Moyes added: ‘Not many people score a hat-trick in Champions League football but it was a great hat-trick.’
