A special undercover squad of Metropolitan Police officers tasked with infiltrating a range of left-wing organisations may have duped more than 100 women into having affairs. 

The Special Demonstration Squad which operated between 1968 and 2008 has been heavily criticised because officers attached to the unit had sexual relations with some of their targets. 

The Metropolitan Police has already paid out more than £400,000 in compensation to a woman who had a child fathered by undercover officer Bob Lambert.

While undercover during the 1980s, Lambert fathered a son with a woman while using the Bob Robinson alias

Lambert, who used the alias Bob Robinson, began a relationship with the woman, known only as Jacqui after he was tasked with infiltrating the Animal Liberation Front. 

The Metropolitan Police has confirmed that it deployed 147 SDS officers in undercover roles over a four-decade period. It is feared that compensation claims against the force could run into a mulit-million pound bill for damages and legal fees. 

According to a source who spoke to The Mirror: 'In nine out of ten cases we know about, SDS officers have had sexual relationships while undercover. There were nearly 150 of them, so it would not be unreasonable to suggest there are many more out there who don't realise they are victims.' 

Jacqui is reportedly to receive £425,000 and in an interview with the Guardian and the BBC, she said she had been receiving psychiatric care after learning of his real identity as a police officer who was married with children.

She said: ‘The legal case is finished but there is no closure for me. There is the money, but there is no admission by the police that what they did was wrong, there is no meaningful apology and most importantly there are no answers.’

‘I don't know why I was singled out by the police to be duped into an intimate sexual relationship with Bob Lambert.

‘I don't know if he was paid overtime to be with me during the 14 hours of labour I went through giving birth to our son. I feel violated.’

It is feared that undercover officers may have slept with more than 100 women over a 40-year period 

In August four former SDS officers were told they faced no criminal charges for their actions.

The Crown Prosecution Service said there was not enough evidence to charge four officers with sexual misconduct offences.

The Met was previously forced to name two officers who allegedly had relationships with women activists in groups they infiltrated after High Court judge Mr Justice Bean ruled the force could not use its policy of ‘neither confirm nor deny’ (NCND) in response to the damages claims.

As a result, the force confirmed Jim Boyling and Bob Lambert were undercover police officers.

Jules Carey, Jacqui's lawyer, told the Guardian and BBC that Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe, the Met commissioner, should publicly condemn the practice of undercover officers having sexual relationships.

So far 12 woman have lodged cases against the Met over the actions of its undercover surveillance officers 

Mr Carey told them: ‘The Metropolitan Police are prepared to criticise the conduct of an individual officer, Bob Lambert. They are even prepared to be critical of the unit he was from - but they refuse to condemn the practice itself.

‘It is time for the commissioner of Metropolitan Police to publicly commit to seeing the end of this shameful and abusive practice’.

A Scotland Yard spokesman said the force ‘unreservedly apologises for any pain and suffering that the relationship with Bob Lambert, an undercover officer, has had on this woman’ but said that it had ‘never had a policy that officers can use sexual relations for the purposes of policing’.

He said: ‘We recognise the impact that the revelation that he was an undercover police officer must have had both on her and her son.

From the outset we have dealt with this lengthy case with professionalism and sensitivity, completely understanding the gravity of the circumstances. We regret if this necessarily complex process has added to her distress.

‘We want to be, and have tried hard to be, as open as we possibly can. Arguing the need to maintain the policy of neither confirm nor deny in relation to undercover operations has never been a refusal to accept wrongdoing, but has been done solely to protect a vital policing tactic.'
