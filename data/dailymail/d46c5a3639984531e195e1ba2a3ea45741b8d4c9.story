Families looking forward to sunny weekends away look set to be disappointed as a blazing hot day tomorrow is expected to give way to thundery showers by the end of the week.

Soaring temperatures could make tomorrow the hottest day of June so far, particularly in the South-East and London, where the mercury could reach highs of 29C (84f).

But the respite will be all too brief, with scattered showers likely to return shortly afterwards, followed by thundery downpours towards the end of the week.

The rain is expected to play havoc with matches as Wimbledon and have a knock-on effect on the Olympics, with the courts needing to be prepared in the short gap between the two sporting events.

But in the meantime however, the sun shone for Andy Murray's opening match at the All England Tennis Club that took place today.

Murray fans flocked to see their hero on the Centre Court today and made the most of a rare spell of warm sunshine in south west London.

While occasional spells of sunshine mixed with rain have seen flowers bloom across the country, there has been little sustained time to bask outdoors during an unreliable start to June.

According to the Met Office, today will see cloud and rain spreading north-eastwards as the weather becomes warm and humid. Far north-east Scotland and, perhaps, parts of south-east England will stay dry but it will start to become humid in the south.

It will remain humid and mainly 
cloudy overnight, but will be wet across most of Scotland with 
intermittent rain elsewhere. Rain will continue on and off around the 
country tomorrow but cloud breaking inland in the southern half of 
England and Wales will allow it to become very warm around the UK - 
climbing as high as 29C (84f) in London and 22C (72f) in Bristol.

Wales will see highs of 20-21C tomorrow while it will reach 19-20C in the North with more rain and cloud around.

A Met Office spokesperson said: 'In sunny breaks tomorrow we could see highs of 25-27C. it will be a mostly cloud start but this will break up inland and across central and south eastern areas.

'There will be rain in the north with around 10-20mm likely.

'On Thursday we will see heavy and thundery showers breaking out in many places. We will still see some sunshine breaking through at times but it won’t be as dry as Wednesday. Top temperatures will be in the mid-20s. There is also a warning in place for rain.

'Temperatures will return to closer to average on Friday with sunshine and showers in the north and west. The wind will also begin to pick up.'

Despite Thursday's humidity, temperatures will climb as high as 24C (75f) in Manchester. Friday and Saturday will be unsettled and windy with showers or more prolonged rain.

Forecasters at Meteogroup said: 'Some late sunshine is possible across Northern Ireland, Wales and parts of southern England as today goes on.

'Otherwise, the rest of the night will be cloudy for most with rain and drizzle in places. Heavier pulses of rain are expected across Scotland, Wales and southern England. Mist patches are likely to develop across Wales and England.

'Scotland will see a lot of cloud with outbreaks of rain tomorrow, heavy and possibly thundery in places.

'Northern Ireland and northern England will see early rain clear to leave a mixture of sunny spells and scattered showers during the afternoon.

'Remaining areas of the UK will see a lot of dry weather but developing sunshine is likely to trigger a few potentially sharp and thundery showers. Should any showers develop, these will most likely be during the afternoon.

'On Thursday, northern areas will see rain during the day, heavy and prolonged. There will be showers elsewhere, some of these heavy and thundery. The showers are expected to clear from the south-west later with some drier and fresher air moving in.

'There will be some bright and sunny spells on Friday with scattered showers. Some of the showers will be heavy particularly across Scotland.'

Meanwhile, the brief spells of hot weather have seen a new range of pet care products launched in the UK - suncream for dogs.

Research has shown that dogs are just as likely to get skin cancer as humans, so a company has developed canine-friendly sunblocks to combat the UV rays. The range includes a 'sunstick' that can be rubbed on to vulnerable areas like the muzzle, nose and ears, which are burnt most easily.

There is also a 'sunmist' which can be sprayed anywhere and is most effective on 'light coloured or short haired dogs'.

Handy ‘sunwipes’ are available for  extra protection, and can be used on any part of a canine’s body.

Each of the three products compares itself with factor 15 suncreams for humans and promises to ‘help prevent sunburn’.

Two of the Petkin products claim they provide ‘the fastest, most convenient way to protect your dog from sun’s harmful ultraviolet rays whenever they’re outdoors.’

Pet accessory distributor Sharples ‘n’ Grant brought the range to the UK from the US, after spotting a gap in the market - although there may not be much call for them for the foreseeable future.

Bright start: The crowds at Wimbledon enjoyed the tennis in shades and sunhats this morning - but it could be a different story by the end of the week

Paul Pugh, marketing director of Sharples ‘n’ Grant, said: 'Dogs, like us, can get skin cancer and if you look online there is a lot of research into this.

'A third of all tumours in dogs are sun related so we thought, there needs to be something to protect against it.

'Human suncreams can’t be used on dogs as there is the PABA chemical in them which is toxic to dogs. There wasn’t a product for dog skin protection on the market in the UK, so we have brought this range over and it will go into pet shops in two weeks' time.

'It’s important to use sun protection on dogs because the risk of them damaging their health due to the sun exposure is quite high, it’s the same as humans.

'People may argue that fur protects a dog from sun damage but you have to also think that humans have a full head of hair and still get skin cancer. It affects short-haired breeds more than long-haired breeds but both varieties are at risk.

'You apply the products just as you would to a person as the lotions impregnate the fur and seep down to the skin.'

The sunwipes cost £3.99, the sunmist £6.99, and the sunstick £5.99.

Meanwhile, parts of the country were hit by another problem this morning - dense fog.

A thick mist rolled across many areas in the West Country, making driving hazardous, and it was so bad off the Cornish coast that it delayed the start of a big sailing race involving four 'super' yachts at Falmouth.

A spokesman for the race organisers said: 'We hope it will have lifted in time for racing to get under way this afternoon.'

This month is already the third wettest June on record, Met Office figures show, with 122.3mm of rain putting it just behind the second wettest June, in 1912, which saw 124.5 mm of rain and a little way off the wettest June, in 2007, which saw 136.2 mm.

The showers have not been evenly spread out, with some areas having already seen record rainfall, while the far north and west of the UK have remained surprisingly dry.
