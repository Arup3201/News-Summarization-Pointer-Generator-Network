A couple who who were asked to leave an Iceland store because their seven-year-old autistic son was 'out of control' claim they have been discriminated against.  

Matthew Lawton was shopping with his wife Amanda, 38, and his son Bradley at an Iceland store in Sheffield, when he claims a security guard asked them to leave.

Mr Lawton claims his autistic son had been putting his hands in the freezers and was running up and down the aisles in the store. 

Iceland contends Bradley was potentially endangering himself and other customers 'by striking the lids of freezer cabinets while wearing a heavy ring'.

Matthew Lawton, pictured with his wife Amanda and his son Bradley, seven, have claimed 'discrimination' after they were asked to leave an Iceland store in Sheffield because their son, who has autism, was running around the store and putting his hands in freezers; the family has been given a £20 voucher from Iceland

The 40-year-old claims the security guard at the store on The Moor, accused him of not being able to control Bradley.  

He said: 'I am absolutely furious. He wasn't in a bad meltdown, but to be told you can't control your son is absolutely disgraceful. I couldn't believe it.'

Mr Lawton said he explained to the security guard that his son had autism, and later called Iceland's head office to complain.The store sent him a £20 voucher.  

Mr Lawton said: 'I want to use the incident to raise awareness of disabled discrimination.

'Because Bradley doesn't need a wheelchair, people sometimes don't realise his condition.

'I'm very passionate about the fact that awareness isn't there and often it's the older generation that frown or don't seem to understand.'

Mr Lawton said his family had suffered 'discrimination'.

Iceland has said that it is investigating the incident and will take 'any action that may be appropriate'; pictured above is The Moor Market, where the Iceland store is located 

He said: 'When you have someone in that job, you have to have an awareness about what you can and can't say. It's discrimination.

'I think we're a little bit behind in this country.'

A spokesman for Iceland said the company is 'opposed to all forms of discrimination'.

'We are well aware of, and sympathetic to, the issues faced by the parents of autistic children and we try our utmost to make allowances for sometimes challenging behaviour in store. However, we must also have regard for the safety of our other customers and staff.' 

The spokesman said a security guard approached the Lawtons and asked them 'to calm' Bradley down and warned they they would have to leave the store if they couldn't.

Iceland gave the family a £20 voucher, the spokesman said, as a 'gesture of goodwill'.

'We offered them as a gesture of goodwill and have already returned to shop in the same store, and we hope to see them and their son in store many times again in the future.' 

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a condition that affects social interaction, communication, interests and behaviour. It includes Asperger syndrome and childhood autism.

Children with ASD can display challenging behaviour, which can sometimes appear physically aggressive.

The condition can also include behaviours like pica (putting inedible things in the mouth) and repetitive hand flapping, tapping or twisting.

The world can be a confusing, isolating and daunting place for a child with autism and it is their difficulties with communication and social interaction that are often the root cause of difficult behaviour.

The child's behaviour is not caused by bad parenting, the National Autistic Society says.

Because of these difficulties, children can find it hard to communicate their needs or to understand what other people are saying to them, or asking them to do.

Children with an ASD may not understand 'social rules' - the unwritten rules that govern social situations, such as how loud or quiet they must be, what behaviour is appropriate in public places, how close to stand to other people or how to take a turn in conversation.

This is especially true if children find themselves in a new, unfamiliar situation.

Therefore, social situations or new situations can be daunting and unpredictable.

This can cause considerable frustration and anxiety which, if it can't be expressed any other way may result in challenging behaviour.
