Criticism: Headteacher Lyn Corderoy has flown off to Ghana to teach literacy skills to children during term time

A headteacher has been criticised for taking the 'appalling' decision to go to Africa for almost a month during term-time.

Lyn Corderoy, headteacher at Grange Primary School in Wickford, Essex, has flown off to Ghana despite parents facing a £60 fine for unauthorised absence during term-time.

Her school, which is rated good by Ofsted but its pupils are below average for English, is taking part in a project to help children in Africa with literacy.

Last year only 65 per cent of her pupils attained the desired national standard for grammar, punctuation and spelling.

Parents have turned on Miss Corderoy, who is taking the time as unpaid leave and accused of 'double standards'.

In Essex, where the school is, more than 500 people a year are fined in this way. 

But the school have said her trip is 'vitally important'.

Susan Godfrey, 46, from Wickford, said: 'I think it's absolutely appalling.

'How is the headteacher allowed to go away for such a long time during term-time? There are parents waiting on decisions she has made and she is not even there.'

Charlotte Worton, 26, from Pitsea, Essex, added: 'I think it's absolutely unfair headteachers can go in term-time.

'It's unfair on the children. Their job is to look after the children during the term time. If they take time off, they're neglecting the children.'

Alan Ball, local UKIP councillor, said he also had concerns about the decision.

He said: 'I have not been made aware of it but it seems to be double standards.

'If you are not allowed to take children out of school and the headteacher disappears for a month, it seems to be double standards to me.

'If the head goes away for a month someone has to cover for the headteacher and it will have a knock-on effect on the pupils eventually.

'It must have, unless they are bringing in someone else at the taxpayers' cost.

'I don't know the situation, but on the face of it, I would have concerns.'

Anger: Parents of children at  Grange Primary School in Wickford, Essex, said the decision to let the headteacher go is 'appalling'

Announcement: Miss Corderoy's time away was announced in the school newsletter last month

Wickford Ukip councillor Nigel Le Gresley said: 'It does to a certain extent smack of double standards, not least because it could perhaps have been done in term time'.   

Parents have accused Miss Corderoy of double standards because they can be fined for taking their children on a term-time holiday.

Previously, head teachers had the discretion to allow pupils up to 10 days of leave from school each year.

However, under new measures brought in by former Education Secretary Michael Gove, children can only be taken out of school in 'exceptional circumstances'.

Parents who take their children out of school without authorisation, they can face a fine of £60 for every child.

Those who refuse to pay can be prosecuted, fined £2,500 and even face jail.

In Essex, where Miss Corderoy's school is, more than 500 people a year are fined in this way. 

News of the headteacher's absence was announced in last month's school newsletter under the headline 'Being a Learning School'.

The short explanation stated: 'I'm sure you will agree with the governors and staff that sharing our good learning and teaching practice with other schools and students is vitally important.

'We support learning in many different ways and after half term the school governors have given Miss Corderoy an unpaid secondment to work on the Let's Read phonic project.

'This is an exciting opportunity to share our school's phonic learning skills.

'Mr Hazelgrove will be acting head for the three weeks she is away.'

A spokesman for Essex County Council defended the decision saying: 'The headteacher is not on leave and this is not a personal project.

'She is on an unpaid professional secondment that will benefit the children's learning.

'Ghanaian teachers have previously visited Grange to help the children learn about other cultures.'

A spokesman for the school governors added: 'The preparation cover arrangements put in place have meant that the good-quality of education and service at the school has been maintained.'

Last month a headteacher was branded a 'hypocrite' after she booked a Caribbean holiday for during term time only to cave in to pressure from parents and cancel it.

Jenny Winder, 53, head of Elstow Primary School near Bedford, had wanted a week off after the Christmas holidays ended for an exotic beach break.

This was despite it being after the start of school term and parents being told in no uncertain terms that they cannot take their children out of lessons.

After days of pressure Bedford Borough Council confirmed Mrs Winder has 'cancelled the proposed leave and will be in work from the start of the new spring term on the January 5, 2015'.

Earlier  parent governor Reverend Jeremy Crocker called on Mrs Winder to cancel her holiday and apologise because her proposed holiday was blatant 'double standards'.

He also said she sent a letter to parents falsely claiming her holiday was 'unanimously' backed by governors like him.

Her school, which she has run for 14 years, warns had parents who take their children out of school during term time facing fines of £60 per child for unauthorised absences. 

Mrs Winder had refused to give an explanation or apologise for trying to take the time off.

She said: 'My private life is exactly what it says - private.'
