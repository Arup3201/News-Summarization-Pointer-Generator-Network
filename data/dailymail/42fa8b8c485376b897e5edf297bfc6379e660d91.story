A new 10 x 10 x 10 cube featuring a built-in bed, kitchen, bathroom and living space is set to change the way we think about small-space living.

Designer Luca Nichetto and developers at Urban Capital unveiled the standalone Cubitat, described as a 'plug and play living space,' at Toronto's Interior Design Show last week.

Not only does the Cubitat include an entertaining area, storage space, and furniture, but it even features a hidden laundry once it is hooked up to plumbing and electric.

The space-saving design, which is still in a prototype phase, will enable city-dwellers to easily and quickly furnish a small building, turning it into a compact home without the need for further renovations or additions. 

Though no timeline has been set, the developers said buyers will soon be able to buy and customize the cubes online, before having them shipped to their destination.

'It’s like that feeling when you open up a brown cardboard package that just arrived in the mail,' says Urban Capital.

Behind a hidden European laundry is access to the bathroom which is located inside the Cubitat

'Cubitat is about a more intelligent, holistic way to design and construct our living environments,' says Urban Capital developer David Wex

'When you lift that thing out of the box and set it down on the table and smile knowing how well it’s going to fit into your life. Just like that, except it’s your house'.

One side of the cube features a fully equipped kitchen with built-in sink, oven, stove top, dishwasher, refrigerator and cupboard space.

Next to the kitchen is an entertaining section, equipped with a flat screen TV, book shelves, storage space and a hidden double bed which slides out from underneath the cabinet.

The designer began working on the Cubitat design in July 2014, unveiling it at Toronto's Interior Design Show last week

Next to the entertaining area is the wardrobe and next to that before reaching the kitchen again is a hidden European laundry, with access to the bathroom which is located inside the Cubitat.

'Cubitat is about a more intelligent, holistic way to design and construct our living environments, taking cues from the prefab world and modern production methods,' says Urban Capital developer David Wex.

'As a builder we look at the automotive, consumer product and tech industries and ask why we can't operate with that much rapidity and flexibility.'
