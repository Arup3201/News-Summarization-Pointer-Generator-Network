She grew up in bonnets and smocks, but now Kate Stoltz is more comfortable in something slightly skimpier.

The 23-year-old, who starred in TLC's Breaking Amish in 2012, has posed in lingerie for a series of racy photographs as she embarks on a modeling career in New York City.

Stoltz left her community in Pennsylvania in 2012 to film the reality television show, which followed a group of Amish and Mennonite youngsters as they had their first taste of modern life in New York.

And it's a life that seems to suit 
Stoltz, who was always vocal about her desire to be a model. But she admitted her 
mother and bishop father aren't so happy with her career choice.

Model behavior: Kate Stoltz, who starred in TLC show Breaking Amish, has left her traditional community and is embarking on a modeling career in New York City. Here she poses for a lingerie photo shoot

Changed: Stoltz, a bishop's daughter, is pictured in 2012 as she appeared on TLC's show, Breaking Amish

'They know what I am doing but they... avoid the subject,' Stoltz told the New York Post.

Stoltz has been signed by Major Model Management and has since taken part in magazine shoots - including for Maxim - and at New York Fashion Week, modeling designs by Cesar Galindo.

But she says that this latest photo shoot is her most revealing.

'A year ago, I never would have done a
 lingerie shoot,' she said. 'I don't know if I've become 
more comfortable with myself or with the idea.'

New life: Stoltz, 23, left her Amish community in Pennsylvania in 2012 to move to New York City

Intimate: She said that her mother and bishop father avoid talking about her chosen career path

New look: In a photoshoot with the New York Post, she ditched her bonnet for her briefs

Stoltz, who was born Kate Stoltzfus, explained that she's used to wearing fancy underwear because it's one of the few treats the Amish women are allowed.

She said: 'My aunt once said, 
"I can't wear nice dresses, but a good pair of underwear always makes me
 feel like I look good, even if I'm the only one that knows it!"'

Stoltz, who is single, is slowly settling into modern society and is getting to grips with her iPhone and social networking sites, where she shares selfies and modeling snaps with fans.

Although she says she does not have a television, she is soon to appear on a spinoff show, Return to Amish, which begins in June.

Comfortable: Stoltz said she has become more at ease with the idea of posing in lingerie over the past year

Career: She has also appeared in Maxim and other magazines and at New York Fashion Week

Bright future: Stoltz will appear in a Breaking Amish spin-off this summer, Return to Amish

The photo shoot isn't the first time she's broken the rules of the strict faith.

During Breaking Amish, she was forced to admit she had been arrested for a DUI before the show.

Blogs also revealed she had previously submitted images to modeling agencies - which is at odds with the Amish stance against photographs, believing they represent 'vanity' which they deem a sin.

Online records show that Kate posted a photograph on exploretalent.com to enter a Best Smile contest in 2010 - years before she claimed she gave up her Amish life to move to the city.
