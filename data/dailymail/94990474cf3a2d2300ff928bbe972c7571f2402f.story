Having spent more than £3,000 on a romantic holiday to Mexico, Gemma Fish and her fiancé were devastated by the ‘prison cell’ room they were given.

But far worse was to come. A month after Miss Fish complained to tour operator Thomson, she was sent abusive emails telling her to ‘shut the **** up’ and book with Thomas Cook instead.

The couple’s ordeal at the hands of Britain’s biggest package holiday firm started within minutes of them checking into their hotel in the resort of Catalonia Riviera Maya.

Verbally abused: Holidaymaker Gemma Fish, received foul-mouthed emails from Thomson's after she complained to the tour operator about being given a 'prison cell' room on their holiday which they had spent more than £3,000 on

The holiday had been planned as a joint Valentine’s Day and birthday celebration for Gemma, 29, and her fiancé Andrew Bracchi.

‘When I arrived at my hotel, the room looked nothing at all like what was advertised on the Thomson website and not what I had expected given the price I paid,’ said Miss Fish.

She had paid extra for a premier room, but found that the decoration was spartan with chipped floor tiles, two beds, a desk and a TV.

‘Quite frankly it was more like a prison cell than what you would expect after paying £3,000 for a holiday. It was just horrendous. I was appalled that they could do this to us,’ she said.

She immediately contacted Thomson 
through its 24-hour ‘holidayline’ telephone service. Her complaints were
acted upon and the couple were moved to a better room, although other 
niggles remained about the noise, poor food and the beach.

A month after returning home to Fuengirola on Spain’s Costa Del Sol, she received a series of abusive emails, suggesting she stop moaning and use rivals Thomas Cook in future.

The first, apparently from a woman member of the customer service team, read: ‘Gemma do u really think we give a ****? Because we dont so shut the **** up with ur moaning and book with Thomas Cook coz we dont want ur custom lol and the hotel have said u r one MOANING bitch’. 

The couple travelled to Mexico in the second half of February.  Miss Fish told BBC’s Watchdog Daily programme that she was shocked by the emails, saying: ‘I don’t swear myself, so I was absolutely gobsmacked that they were even able to get through the system with that language in. It was just awful, and after everything we’d been through on the holiday, it was just the final bit for us really. It wasn’t nice at all.’

Blames angry employee: Thomson acted upon Miss Fish's room complaint but a month later she received the abusive emails which Thomson blamed on a disgruntled employee who 'interfered with a number of internal email accounts'

Thomson has blamed a disgruntled employee for sending the abusive emails. A spokesman said: ‘Thomson would like to apologise to Ms Fish for the unacceptable emails she received.

‘An employee interfered with a number of internal email accounts, sending inappropriate emails. 

‘We carried out a full internal investigation, as well as supporting the police in their investigation, the issue was dealt with immediately and the staff member was dismissed.’ 

Initially, the company offered the couple an apology and some holiday vouchers. This was then improved to a cheque for £100 and then £150 – but Miss Fish insists that this is still unsatisfactory.

The spokesman said: ‘We would like to reassure our customers that the interference of these email accounts was an isolated incident. Customer service is of paramount importance to Thomson.’
