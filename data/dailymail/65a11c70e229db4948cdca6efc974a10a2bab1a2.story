The new Tesco boss has been urged to split the business into three separate stores based on its Finest, Everyday Value, and ordinary brands to tackle the threat from Aldi and Lidl.

The supermarket giant has been hit by profit warnings as its businesses suffered outside the UK, while British shoppers have been turning to lower cost rivals.

New chief executive Dave Lewis, who is due to start in October, has now been advised by an industry analyst to split up the company into a discount chain to take on the German-owned stores and a higher-end version rivalling Waitrose or Marks & Spencer, as well as the regular branches.

Threat: Share prices at Tesco have fallen as the supermarket struggled to kick-start a strategy to fend off the growth of discounters, led by Aldi and Lidl

The supermarket group is now worth £10billion less than a year ago, and analyst Bruno Monteyne said he believes that breaking up the chain is the only way to halt Tesco's decline.

Mr Lewis will join Tesco after more than 25 years experience working at consumer goods group Unilever.

In a research note, Mr Monteyne of Bernstein Research, suggested that breaking up the brand would enable Tesco to use different approaches to entice different customers into its stores.  

'Rip out 20 per cent of the range, have cheaper shelving and cheaper products in the more deprived areas and give customers a better deal,' he wrote, according to The Independent.

Tesco's share price has fallen 33 per cent in the past year to 247p on 22 August.

The retailer has been hit by profit warnings as its businesses suffered outside the UK, while shoppers in its home region began turning to lower cost rivals.

The supermarket group is now worth £10billion less than a year ago after its shares plunged as it struggled to kick-start a strategy to fend off the growth of discounters, led by German-owned Aldi and Lidl, and suffered from perceived over-expansion in its boom years.

It recently lost its chief executive Phil Clarke with a new one Dave Lewis due to take over in autumn.

'In London, where people want someone behind the counter who knows the difference between a parma ham and a serrano ham, that requires more investment.'

Tesco announced last month that CEO Philip Clarke, who had worked his way up to the top job during 40 years with the company, would be replaced by Mr Lewis following a profits warning. 

During Mr Clarke's tenure he had invested £1bn cutting prices, refreshing stores, increasing staff numbers and service levels but the business had continued to lose market share.

Share prices dropped as Tesco struggled to kick-start a strategy to fend off the growth of discounters, led by Aldi and Lidl, and the chain suffered from perceived over-expansion in its boom years. 

A former Tesco executive himself, Mr Monteyne said that by splitting up the brand Tesco would be able to charge different prices around the country, enabling it to compete with discounters in poorer areas, and more upmarket shops in affluent towns.

'By Tesco promising to have the same prices in the most affluent areas as the poorest areas, it’s basically tied its hands behind its back by committing to an uneconomical model,' he said. 

A study for The Grocer magazine earlier this month found that Lidl was almost a third cheaper than the major supermarket chains, and that both it and Aldi have made dramatic gains in market share. In the 12 months to July 2014, Aldi’s market share rose 32.2 per cent, while Lidl’s grew 19.5 per cent.

Retail experts said their success will intensify the competition, forcing bigger chains to ‘up their game’ and slash prices.

The Grocer’s ‘shopping basket survey’ found Lidl charged 29.5 per cent less than Tesco for 33 popular lines, and that while a weekly shop at Tesco cost £63.73, the equivalent at Lidl was £49.23. 

As well as the threat of Aldi and Lidl, Tesco's overseas operation has also suffered. The company has exited both the Japanese and US markets, and in the last financial year, trading profit for its European operations fell as sales in the likes of Hungary, Poland and Turkey, all declined.
