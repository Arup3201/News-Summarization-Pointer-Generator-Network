TV presenter Michael Palin dismissed a suggestion today that a film producer was a seventh member of the Monty Python comedy team.

The star is currently battling the claims of Mark Forstater, producer of the film Monty Python And The Holy Grail, for a share in the royalties from the stage musical Spamalot.

The West End show has proved to be a popular spin-off to the Holy Grail movie.

Mr Forstater, 69, believes he was promised an equal share of all 
Holy Grail merchandising and off-shoots – along with stars Palin, Eric Idle, John Cleese, Terry Jones, Terry Gilliam and Graham 
Chapman.

But Palin today told a High Court trial that the idea that Mr Forstater was a “seventh Python” would not have been accepted.

He said: 'It may have been what he wanted but it was never going to be accepted by the Pythons.

'The idea of a "seventh Python" just doesn’t happen. It was never going to be accepted.

'I don’t think there was ever any suggestion this man was going to be a "seventh Python".'

Palin said Mr Forstater had not 'created' Monty Python And The Holy Grail.

'The film had been created by the Python team entirely,' he added.

'Mark came on board. He became the producer. But I don’t think he was entitled to anything beyond that.

'Mark was not part of our team.'

He also said it was unlikely that that Mr Forstater had 'input' into writing the Grail film.

'It doesn’t seem really likely to me,' he told the court.

'There were six of us. We were a tight group. We wrote our own material.'

Palin said 'major decisions' would have been taken by 'the Pythons themselves'.

'I find it really bizarre that Mark should think he would have been 
there writing the film with us,' he added.

'It just wouldn’t happen.'

Spamalot has already grossed more than £110million during a four-year stint on Broadway.

The High 
Court last week heard how Mr Forstater, of Queens Park, West London, was in 
financial difficulties having been declared bankrupt.

His lawyer Tom 
Weisselberg said the row broke out after the ‘huge international 
commercial success of Spamalot,’ which is currently running in the West 
End.

He said that for financial purposes, Mr Forstater should be treated as ‘the seventh Python’.

He told Mr Justice Norris: ‘This claim
arises out of a dispute regarding profit-sharing of revenues from the 
British comedy film Monty Python and the Holy Grail.

‘Regrettably, the parties have not 
been able to resolve the dispute. Mr Forstater is in difficult financial
circumstances and has been forced to bring these proceedings.’

He said the claim concerns the 
interpretation of a profit-sharing agreement signed by Mr Forstater with
the Pythons’ company back in 1974, the year before the Holy Grail film 
was released.

Number 7? Mark Forstater, producer of Monty Python And The Holy Grail, arrives at court today

Mr Forstater claims he signed an agreement to allow him one seventh of the Pythons’ share of any merchandising and spin-offs.

The surviving Pythons claim this sum 
was only ever 1/14. Exactly how much Mr Forstater is claiming was not 
stated in court, but after the hearing he told the Mail he was seeking a
‘ball-park figure’ of £250,000.

Mr Weisselberg added: ‘We say it is 
common ground that Mr Forstater was entitled to a share in the 
merchandising and spin-off from the film. The dispute relates to the 
extent of that entitlement.

‘The outrage expressed by a number of 
Pythons in their witness statements as to the suggestion that Mr 
Forstater was to be treated as the seventh Python is, with respect to 
them, misguided.’

Jones, 70, Palin and Idle, both 69, 
attended the start of the five-day hearing yesterday. They are expected 
to give evidence next week.

However, Cleese, 73, who lives in Monaco, 
and Gilliam, 72, who is filming in Romania, will not appear.

Written by 
Idle, Spamalot opened on Broadway in February 2005 and moved to the West
End the following year.

The sell-out musical, a comic take on the story
of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table, has now returned for
another run in London.

Monty Python's Spamalot! The play is a 'loving rip-off' of the Holy Grail film from 1975

Palin is reported as referring to the 
money-spinning musical, which includes the hit number Always Look On The
Bright Side Of Life, as his ‘pension plan’.

Forstater is also claiming entitlement to money from the film company Freeway Cam which owns the copyright to the Holy Grail.

The hearing continues.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
