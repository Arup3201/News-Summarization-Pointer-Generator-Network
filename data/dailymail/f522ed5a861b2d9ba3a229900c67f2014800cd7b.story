It was a moment on Instagram on Monday that really set tongues wagging about the prospect of Lionel Messi moving to Chelsea.

As the Barcelona superstar clicked follow on Chelsea and Cesc Fabregas, the chatter about a possible move from the Nou Camp to Stamford Bridge on social media understandably grew louder.

And amidst the turmoil at Barcelona with the dismissal of sporting director Andoni Zubizarreta and the reported fall-out between Messi and head coach Luis Enrique, all of a sudden the prospect of the Argentinian wearing a Chelsea shirt did not seem so unrealistic.

The fact that Messi had just started following former Barcelona team-mate Fabregas on Instagram was a slight surprise as the two have been good friends for a while, with their respective partners Antonella Roccuzzo and Daniella Semaan also enjoying a close friendship.

Messi fuelled speculation he could be keen on a move to Chelsea by following the club's Instagram account 

Ahead of Fabregas's switch from Barcelona to Chelsea last summer, Semaan sent an Instagram message to her friend, saying 'I miss this girl so so so so much' before using the hashtag #tevoyaextranar, translated as 'I'll miss you'. 

And the relationship between Semaan and Roccuzzo may well be a crucial factor if Messi was to consider joining Chelsea.

Semaan and Roccuzzo have been spotted together in London in recent months, enjoying shopping trips in Knightsbridge and in November they were joined by Fabregas for a lunch at a London restaurant.

A quick look through their Instagram pages shows just how close they are and Roccuzzo would surely find the prospect of living in London along with her best friend appealing.

If Messi was to make a move to London, the fact he has close friends here would help him settle after living in Barcelona since 2000.

Fabregas publicly, though, has been careful to play down suggestions that he could be involved in a potential Messi move but did acknowledge that he would love to play alongside his mate again.

The Chelsea midfielder told Spanish radio program Al Primer Toque on Onda Cero: 'I'm upset that they say that I could be mediating for Messi to come to Chelsea. How can I be talking about contracts... I'm only a footballer.

'He (Messi) will do what makes him happiest. Personally, as his friend, colleague and footballer, if you gave me the chance to play with him again, I would welcome it.'

Manchester United and Real Madrid are the only two clubs that could sign Lionel Messi for an outright fee within Financial Fair Play rules, according to a football finance expert.

And considering that the prospect of Messi moving from Barcelona to their arch rivals is unlikely, then the Old Trafford club may be the only realistic destination for the Argentinian if he was to leave the Nou Camp.

Even then, meeting the 27-year-old's wages without breaking UEFA's FFP rules could prove a struggle.

An offer of £196million would meet Messi's buy-out clause and oblige Barcelona to sell if it was the player's will to leave.

Rob Wilson, a football finance expert at Sheffield Hallam University, told the BBC: 'With the revenue they generate and cash reserves, only United and Real Madrid could pay the fee.

'With salary costs probably even they couldn't stay within FFP.'

If a club exceeds losses of more than £23.5m over a three-year period that includes the current campaign, they open themselves to the prospect of sanctions by UEFA.

A staggered transfer payment could avoid any breach of rules but it is believed that Barcelona would be unlikely to accept this.

Wilson said: 'Unless Messi absolutely wanted to get out of the club, why would Barcelona agree to that?

'Staggering the payments would certainly make it easier for Chelsea, Manchester City, PSG and Bayern Munich but Manchester United demanded the fee up front when they sold Cristiano Ronaldo and I strongly suspect it would be the same for Messi.'
