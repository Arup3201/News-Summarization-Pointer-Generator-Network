Mathieu Debuchy has confirmed he may need surgery on an ankle injury he suffered in Arsenal 2-2 draw against Manchester City on Saturday.

The France international collapsed in a heap unopposed in the final few minutes of the Premier League clash after catching his studs in the turf and damaging ligaments in his left ankle.

The 29-year-old took to Facebook on Wednesday to confirm he has broken a ligament and will now wait until a verdict is made on Friday if he will need surgery to repair the damage caused.

'No fracture but one broken ligament... I have to wait until Friday in order to know if I must have surgery.' he wrote on the social media website.

Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger admitted Debuchy’s injury, in the 81st minute, hurt his team against City, who grabbed a point through Martin Demichelis's header two minutes later.

'We just switched off,' said the Arsenal boss. 'We did not look the same team. Not because of Chambers but we looked a bit lost.'

Debuchy joined Arsenal in the summer as a replacement for Bacary Sagna, who left to play for City, and had impressed with his performances so far at the Emirates.

19-year-old Hector Bellerin made his debut for the Gunners in their 2-0 Champions League Group D opening defeat at Borussia Dortmund on Tuesday - in place of the injured Debuchy.
