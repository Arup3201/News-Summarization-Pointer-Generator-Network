A gang of stinking skunks has been terrorizing an upscale California neighborhood, destroying lawns and spraying residents as they try to get the animals away from their posh homes.

Homeowner Vince Matranga says he's trapped several skunks using eggs and peanut butter as bait  — and one neighbor has managed to capture more than 10 just in his Granite Bay property.

'When you think you catch them all then another wave of skunks come in,' Vince Matranga told CBS Sacramento.

'They're digging up my grass,' he added. 'They're looking for grubs and insects and making a big mess.'

Homeowners in Granite Bay, near Sacramento, say they can't get rid of skunks like this one, which was caught digging through lawns and attacking people with its foul-smelling spray

Matrangas says the animals are fierce and won't back down from a fight.

'I got a little too close a few times and got sprayed…just threw those clothes away,' the frustrated resident told CBS Sacramento. 

And when Matranga manages to get rid of one skunk, it seems another is just around the corner. 

'There's one here looking right at me,' he told CBS Sacramento.

Brandt Jordan, of Spiderman Pest Control, told the station that the skunks are spreading out.

'Folsom, Granite Bay — a lot of outlying areas, Loomis,' he told CBS Sacramento. 'Anywhere where there's open pastures, we're getting calls for that.'

Jordan says the invasion could be a result of California's dry summer followed by heavy rainfall, which greatly diminished food stocks for the animals. 

Animal control is picking up cages with the trapped skunks throughout this week. 

Animal control officials say the skunks appear to be digging for food in new places after California's dry summer, followed by heavy rainfall, greatly diminished their usual food stocks
