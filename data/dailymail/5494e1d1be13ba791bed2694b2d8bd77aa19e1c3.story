Brazil's economy has overtaken Britain's for the first time to become the seventh largest in the world, figures have revealed.

But despite the Latin American powerhouse's dramatic rise UK taxpayers have been forking out millions of pounds in aid to support them.

Brazil's total output last year was worth £1.56trillion - compared with £1.53trillion in Britain, think-tank Cebr said.

The UK economy grew by just 0.8 per cent last year and contracted by 0.2 per cent in the final quarter, leaving the country on the verge of a double-dip recession.

In contrast, economic output rose by 2.7 per cent in Brazil, which has a population of around 200million.

Tim Ohlenburg, senior economist at Cebr, 
said: 'It's a natural enough movement. Brazil has a large population, 
has massive natural resources and strong local industry. It's just a 
country set for higher growth.'

Britain fell one place to seventh in the world economic rankings while Brazil closed the gap on France and Germany.

Despite the UK's relative decline, money continues to be poured into 
wealthy and fast-growing countries such as India, and even aid to 
China, second in the world economic league, was ordered to come to an 
end only this year.

According to figures on the website 
of the Department For International Development, £13.6million worth of 
taxpayer-funded development schemes for Brazil remained ‘operational’.

They
include a scheme to work up environmental projects billed at almost 
£9million, another to ‘improve flexibility, agility and responsiveness 
in the implementation of DFID regional objectives’ worth more than 
£1.2million, and unidentified schemes costing more than £2.4million.

Relative decline: Britain has fallen behind Brazil in the world economic output league tables

DFID
officials said that the spending was ‘historic’ and included 
projects dating from the 1990s, and that they were listed as remaining 
in operation only because of ‘an IT error’.

They said today the aid programme for Brazil has recently been closed.

However,
they acknowledged that taxpayers’ money is still going in aid to 
Brazil, in the form of a £730,000 ‘large emerging economies programme’ 
to ‘develop a shared agenda and promote global poverty reduction 
objectives.’

This project, DFID said, is to be wound down 'this year'.

A spokesman said: 'Our Secretary of State has been clear we will not give aid to Brazil in the future to fight poverty.'

While cuts in public spending are made in Britain, £1.3 billion — some 16 per cent of the aid budget — is being given to the EU.

Robert Oxley, campaign manager of the TaxPayers’ Alliance said: 'It's madness to fund aid for an economy doing much better than ours.

'DfID should stop sending our money to countries who don't need it and focus on helping the world's poorest.

'The Brazilian Government can afford its own aid programmes rather than relying on British taxpayers to fund them instead.'

Brazil's growth last year still 
represented a severe slowdown on the previous year's 7.5 per cent as 
soaring business costs and uncompetitive industries took their toll on 
the country's performance.

The biggest drag on the Brazilian 
economy is industrial production, which shrank 0.5 per cent in the 
fourth quarter compared with the previous quarter.
