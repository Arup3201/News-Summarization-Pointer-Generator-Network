Attack: Vishar Jain, 44, stamped on the head of a four-year-old boy when he interrupted an episode of Doctor Who by sighing

A Doctor Who fan fractured a four-year-old boy's skull in a frenzied attack after the child interrupted an episode of the programme by sighing.

Vishar Jain, 44, was jailed for nine years for the horrific attack which left the child in intensive care fighting for his life.

The boy also suffered a fractured collarbone, cuts to his mouth and several bruises after repeatedly being punched and kicked.

Jain also lashed out at his victim's mother when she tried to intervene to stop the abuse which left the boy emotionally scarred.

The computer engineer, who had been in a relationship with the boy's mother for two years, has never provided an explanation for the attack, Birmingham Crown Court heard.

He began raining blows and kicks as he sat on a sofa with the child and his mother.

The boy, twice thrown to the wooden floor and stamped on, spent two weeks in hospital recovering from his injuries.

Jain turned on the boy’s mother when she tried to rescue him. She suffered cuts and bruises to her face.

Judge Philip Parker QC said that before the attack it had been an ordinary afternoon and the three had sat together watching the episode of Doctor Who.

He told Jain: 'You became irritated by his behaviour when he was sitting between you and his mother.

'You chastised him and then what followed was a quite unexplained outburst of uncontrollable violence which was your reaction to no more than the child simply sighing.'

Claire Harris, prosecuting, said that on March 23 the boy uttered something that Jain interpreted as interrupting the adults’ conversation.

He slapped the child on his face. When his mother tried to intervene he slapped and punched her.

Miss Harris said: 'He then lifted him up into the air and dropped him on the floor.'

He lifted the child’s head and banged it on the wooden floor. He went on to repeatedly kick and stamp on his head.

The boy’s mother said she remembered the 'banging noise' as her son hit the floor. He was motionless and she feared he was dead.

The child was so traumatised by the attack that he suffered nightmares afterwards and would lapse into zombie-like trances, the judge was told.

Gerard Cullen, defending, said 'It is perhaps more by luck than judgment that the child has, in fact, recovered well from his physical injuries.

'Psychologically, of course, it is going to take a lot longer. This was not a case where there was any premeditation at all. This defendant simply snapped.'

The court heard there was a 'significant risk' Jain, of Edgbaston, Birmingham, would behave in a totally unjustified and irrational way again.

Jain admitted causing 
grievous bodily harm with intent and common assault at an earlier hearing.

Following the case, Detective Constable Hayley Bubb, from Birmingham’s Child Protection team, said: 'This was an unprovoked and sustained attack on a defenceless child, which he has never explained.'
