A tattered scrap of papyrus has been found to feature original Sappho poetry dating back to the 7th century BC.

Oxford papyrologist Dr. Dirk Obbink was asked to translate the ancient text by the unidentified owner and was shocked to discover it featured not one, but two of the Greek poet's original verses.

Only a handful of original Sappho poetry has survived, printed on various fragments of papyrus, and only one of these poems is written in full.  

The papyrus, pictured, was translated by Oxford papyrologist Dr. Dirk Obbink who confirmed it features two poems written by 7th century Greek poet Sappho. The first contains reference to Sappho's family, while the other is a poem addressed to the Greek goddess of love Aphrodite

Sappho was a Greek lyrist renowned for her verses about love and loss. In particular, many of her poems described a love of women and female homosexuality.

In fact, modern-day words including 'lesbian' and 'sapphic', are said to have derived from Sappho, her poems and her time on the isle of Lesbos.

In total, Sappho wrote nine volumes of poems and while these latest findings do not feature complete poems, due to the tattered edges of the papyrus, there is a substantial amount of text to confirm they are Sapphic in style.

The first poem contains reference to two men called Charaxos and Larichos.

Sappho (Roman bust pictured right) was a Greek poet believed to have been born between 630 and 612 BC. 

She was an aristocrat who married a merchant, and had a daughter called Cleis. 

During the 7th century BC, Sappho spent time studying the arts on the isle of Lesbos writing poetry and composing music. 

She wrote her poems in what’s now become known as the ‘sapphic meter’ and was part of a new wave of Greek lyrists who wrote poetry from their own viewpoint, rather than the viewpoint of the gods, which was traditional during that time. 

In particular, Sappho was one of the first poets to describe love, and loss, as it affected her personally.

Many of her poems expressed love and affection for women and modern-day words used to describe female homosexuality, namely 'lesbian' and 'sapphic', derived from Sappho, her poems and her time on the isle of Lesbos. 

Many modern poets have been inspired by Sappho, including Michael Field, Renée Vivien and Marie-Madeleine, who have all cited Sappho as a strong influence on their work.

These are the names the Ancient Greeks gave to Sappho’s brothers, yet the poem is the first evidence of them found in Sappho’s poetry. 

It describes a conversation between two people about the success of Charaxos’ latest sea voyage and appears to be written in the first person.

The other is a poem addressed to the Greek goddess of love Aphrodite. A horizontal red line signifies where one poem ends and the other begins.

Sappho and Alcaeus by Lawrence Alma-Tadema. Sappho was a 7th century Greek lyrist renowned for her verses about love and loss. In particular, many of her poems described love of women and female homosexuality and modern-day words including lesbian and sapphic derive from Sappho

Only a handful of original poems and poem fragments have survived, including this papyrus found in 1922

As Dr. Obbink explained: ‘All the poems of Sappho’s first book seem to have been about family, biography, and cult, together with poems about love [and] Aphrodite.'

The poems were also written in a Greek dialect called Aeolic, a language Sappho often used to write her poems in, and which was different from Attic Greek.

Additionally, both were written in the so-called Sapphic stanza - a poetic meter created by Sappho - and Dr Obbink claims this leaves him in no doubt the poems are from Sappho’s original poetry collection.

'The new Sappho is the best preserved Sappho papyrus in existence, with just a few letters that had to be restored in the first poem, and not a single word that is in doubt. Its content is equally exciting.'

According to Dr Obbink, the style of handwriting suggests the poem was transcribed onto the papyrus in around the 3rd century A.D .

Daughter of Zeus, Immortal, Aphrodite, serene. Weaver of spells, at thy portal hear me and slay not, O Queen!

As in the past, hither to me from thy far palace of gold, drawn by the doves that overflew me, come, as thou earnest of old. 

Swiftly thy flock bore thee hither, smiling, as turned I to thee, spoke thou across the blue weather:

‘Sappho, why callest thou me? Sappho, what Beauty disdains thee, Sappho, who wrongest thine heart, Sappho, what evil now pains thee, Whence sped the dart?

‘Flies from thee, soon she shall follow, turns from thee, soon she shall love, seeking thee swift as the swallow, ingrate though now she may prove.’

Come, once again to release me, join with my fire thy fire, freed from the torments that seize me, give me, O Queen! my desire!
