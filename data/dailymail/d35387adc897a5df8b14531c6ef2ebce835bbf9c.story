This brazen picture shows fraudster Nicholas Wayne Lowe relaxing on a sun lounger catching some rays holding up a wad of 500 Thai Baht bills to the camera. 

The snap, released by the South Australia Court Registry, reveals an insight into the sort of lifestyle the former public servant was living before he was caught stealing $1.135 million from the Victims of Crime Fund.

At the latest court hearing on Wednesday Lowe, who headed up an embezzlement ring that swiped the cash  over a period of four years, was told by Judge Paul Muscat at the District Court that he will be swapping the silver service he was used to for plastic service, reports The Advertiser.

The judge added: 'They enjoyed themselves at the expense of the Victims of Crime fund ... there’s simply nothing (here) but sheer greed, luxury and excess.”

The court heard how a junior Crown Solicitor’s Office clerk discovered the conspiracy Lowe's wife Andrea, a former employee of MP Jennifer Rankine’s, deleted an incriminating email chain.

She has pleaded guilty to one count of impeding an investigation and was due to be sentenced today. 

Lowe, 31, stole the cash between October 2008 and August 2012 and employed his family and friends in the lucrative scheme. 

Lowe appeared at Adelaide District Court yesterday and was told he would be sentenced by December 5 

The former clerk in the Crown Solicitor's Office pleaded guilty on May last year to 26 aggravated counts of dishonestly dealing with documents.

In the four years he personally pocketed $491,200 share of the $1.135 million illicitly obtained by the fraud group, reports The Advertiser. 

The court heard how the other men involved in the fraud racket were Lowe's family and friends who he asked 'want to make some money?' and said all he needed to use was their names to make the false claims.

Lowe worked at the Crown Solicitor's Office in Adelaide when he committed the crimes between 2008 and 2012

The other defendants- James Peter Moore, Steven and Travis Langston, Kane Peter Dominey, Andrew John Soliatis and Daniel Stephen Almstetter- each pleaded guilty to one or more counts of the same offence, reports The Advertiser. 

After the false claims were made Lowe would then approve and issue to them and when they were cashed half was given back to Lowe. 

Judge Muscat gave Soliatis, Almstetter, Moore and Steven Langston suspended jail sentences on the condition of good behaviour at Wednesday's hearing. 

Dominey and Travis Langston were also bailed to be sentenced in two weeks on November 19 

Lowe was remanded in custody until December 5.
