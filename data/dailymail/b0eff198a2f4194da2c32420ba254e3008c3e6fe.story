Comedian David Walliams has earned £13 million from five books since the release of his first foray into children's literature four years ago.

Figures show that Walliams - best known as a comedian - is now more successful as a writer of children's books and has been taken to the hearts of the nation as one of its best loved authors.

He has sold 2.2 million books in the UK and a further 200,000 around the world, it has been reported.

The total sales in the UK for his books has just gone over £13 million and as of this week stands at £13,198,871.97, according to experts Nielsen Bookscan.

He will share the money with his publisher Harper Collins, but takes a substantial cut to add to his already formidable fortune.

Walliams only wrote his first children's book Mr Stink in October 2009. It has since sold more than half a million copies in the UK.

Next was Billionaire Boy in June 2011 which sold around 550,000 copies, then Ratburger in September last year which sold 300,000.

In 2013 he published Gangster Granny in February which sold more than 520,000, followed soon after by The boy in the Dress in July which sold around 350,000.

The sales are set to continue in the Autumn with the third release of the year Demon Dentist, which is due out later this month.

The sales put Walliams in the same bracket as JK Rowling and Roald Dahl as superstar children's book writers.

One publisher said: 'He is a phenomenon, people who think of him as a comedian are wrong. He is by far and away the most successful children's book writer for years. He's the Roald Dahl of his generation.'

It's an amazing second career for Walliams who is one of the country's leading comedians.

He shot to fame as Matt Lucas's comedy partner in Little Britain, which established itself as the country's most popular funny show.

He has homes in London and Brighton and married model Lara Stone, with whom he recently had a baby son called Alfred.
