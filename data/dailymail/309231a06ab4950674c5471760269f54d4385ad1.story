Jack Wilshere was back out training with his Arsenal team-mates on Tuesday morning after his injury scare at the weekend.

Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger was facing a midfield injury crisis with Aaron Ramsey, Mikel Arteta and Wilshere all picking up knocks against Tottenham on Saturday.

Wilshere turned his ankle badly and it was feared he could have done serious damage to one of his problematic ankles.

Wenger said: 'Jack Wilshere is in the squad for tomorrow, will I start him? I don’t know yet, but he’s in the squad.

'We lost Mikel Arteta and Aaron Ramsey in our last game and it could have been three because Wilshere was a doubt for a long time but he recovered quite well.'

But the England midfielder was back out and looked sharp in the bright sunshine at Arsenal's London Colney training ground.

Wilshere was one of the first out, kicking a ball around in a circle with Alexis Sanchez, Mathieu Flamini and Francis Coquelin. 

Then the 18-man squad for their Champions League tie against Galatasaray were taken through some early light runs with Shad Forsythe, the American fitness coach who has been brought in to work with the team after being part of Germany's national set up who won the World Cup.

Theo Walcott came out later than the rest of the group to do some light training without the first team as he edges closer to a return. The winger has not played since January 4, when he damaged the cruciate ligament in his knee playing against Tottenham in the FA Cup.

Wenger later revealed that he is confident that Walcott will rejoin training with the rest of the squad next week.

The Arsenal boss said: 'Walcott is joining in full training next week. It’s very good news. Serge Gnabry as well.

'It’s a big thing for us. Let’s not forget that Theo got injured on January 1 and we are now in October. That’s 10 months and we had to wait for a long time. Hopefully now we will have no more setbacks.'

The first-team group were also joined on Tuesday by Stefan O'Connor, a centre-back, and Brandon Ormonde-Ottewill, a left-back, two teenagers brought in to train with the first team, but who will not play a part on Wednesday night.

After 10 minutes of light running the team broke out into smaller groups where they did more work on the ball.

Ramsey, with a hamstring injury, and Arteta, struggling with a calf problem, will both be out longer-term.
