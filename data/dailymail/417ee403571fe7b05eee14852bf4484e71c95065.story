This is the embarrassing moment two teenagers had to be rescued in a dinghy just yards from the river bank - after they misjudged the tide and became stranded on mudflats.

The distressed pair, both 15, were forced to wait for the coastguard after landing themselves in the sticky situation on the River Medway, in Gillingham, Kent on Sunday afternoon.

The friends, who had life jackets on and a two-way radio with them, had launched the rubber dinghy from the side of a sailing boat belonging to one of the boys' father.

Sticky situation: The teenagers misjudged the tide and became stranded on mudflats on the River Medway prompting a rescue mission on Sunday afternoon

The Medway Coastguard team and a specialist mud rescue crew were called at 3pm and soon arrived on the scene to winch the boys to safety.

In the video, one rescuer was captured wading through the muddy waters to reach the hopeless pair and attach the rope. 

The over-the-top response also saw fire engines called out - and amused firefighters can be seen looking on and laughing as the teenagers sit helplessly in the stationary boat. 

Dirty work: The rubber dinghy had to be winched to the bank of the river by a team from Medway Coastguard

Richard Rodgers, deputy station officer for the Medway Coastguard team, said: 'The boys had all the safety equipment they need with them but had just got caught out by the tide.

'The nearby yacht club had alerted us to their predicament and they were a bit cold when they got back to shore.

'However they were checked out by the ambulance crew and were fine.'
