Guilty: Photographer Les Pringle at Newcastle Crown Court who has been convicted of inflicting grievous bodily harm will be sentenced next month

A man who infected his former girlfriend with HIV could have passed the virus on to many more women, police have revealed.

Photographer Leslie Pringle, 48, from Tynemouth, North Tyneside, was convicted of inflicting grievous bodily harm following a trial at Newcastle Crown Court and will be sentenced next month.

He recklessly had unprotected sex with her despite knowing he was HIV positive.

Police have now appealed to any of Pringle's former lovers to get themselves checked.

They believe he had several former lovers in the North East and Yorkshire.

Chief Superintendent Winton Keenan said: 'Given that Pringle may have had other 
sexual relationships since he was infected we have a public duty to 
publicise this case to ensure any other potential victims are made aware
and can seek advice.

'Anyone with concerns that they may be at risk should seek confidential advice from their local sexual health service provider.

'Pringle's actions were morally 
reprehensible and he has shown no remorse for his actions. His victim 
will have to live with the consequences of his actions for the rest of 
her life.'

Pringle, who had a studio in Whitley Bay in North Tyneside,  hadn't told anyone about his illness, had stopped taking drugs for the condition and attending hospital appointments.

Mr Keenan said the woman, known as X in court to preserve her anonymity, had showed 'tremendous bravery and courage' in giving evidence.

'She will have to live with the consequences of Pringle's actions for the rest of her life,' the officer said.

'He breached her trust and showed 
absolutely no regard for her personal safety by withholding the 
information that he was HIV positive.

'Pringle knew he was HIV positive but 
recklessly ignored the health advice he had been given by having 
unprotected sexual relations with the victim.

'This was a challenging and difficult 
investigation due to the complexity of bringing such a case to court and
the rules of confidentiality that rightly govern health issues.'

Outside court, the woman said: 'The actions of Les Pringle towards 
myself have taken away so many choices I should have been entitled to, 
therefore I ask that I am allowed to continue to lead a private and 
dignified life as is my human right.

'I would like to take this opportunity 
to urge anyone who has had a relationship with Les Pringle to contact 
their Sexual Health Services and request HIV testing.

'Early diagnosis and treatment can prevent irretrievable breakdown of good health, and ultimately saves lives.

'The care and support I received has helped me enormously in re-building my life.

'Should any persons feel it necessary to
talk to the police, I want to state with complete confidence that 
without prejudice or judgment, the respect and kindness I have received 
has shown no bounds.

'The selfish behaviour of Les Pringle is nothing short of appalling.

'Through the position he now finds 
himself in, I hope Les Pringle uses this time to reflect on the damage 
he has done through his treatment of others, and learn something of 
compassion.

'There is no shame in having an HIV test, or indeed being HIV positive. Look after yourself and others, going for a test may well save your life.'
