A blind sled dog named Gonzo is never far from his brother Poncho, who for years has acted as his sight on the trails in New Hampshire. 

Now that the Alaskan husky brothers are nearing age 10, NH Sled Dog Rescue is looking to retire them and hope to send the two inseparable friends to the same family. 

Both Gonzo and Poncho were born with sight but in 2010, trainers started to realize Gonzo was losing his sight when he started tripping over his food.

When his blindness was initially diagnosed, a veterinarian urged his owners to keep him on the sled dog team, and that's when Poncho stepped up to the plate.  

'At first it kind of upset him (Poncho) because it slightly hindered his ability to run straight because Gonzo was leaning up against him,' musher Wes Guerin told WMUR. 

'Over time, Poncho kind of realized he was the only thing keeping his brother on the trail. He started to help him. If there was a left turn coming up or a right turn, he'd pull him this way or nudge him that way and do whatever he had to do to make sure he (Gonzo) didn't run off the trail or anything like that,' Guerin said. 

On the off occasion that Gonzo has run off the trail, Poncho has picked him up out of ditches by dragging him by the collar.

'I've run dogs in a lot of places, all over the country, and it was the most amazing thing I've ever seen sled dogs do,' musher Neil Beaulieu told the Associated Press in 2013. 

While the reliance on Poncho worked for several years, Gonzo eventually had to quit sled running this fall, when a doctor removed the other eye that was giving him limited sight. 

Since then he has become quite accustomed to life as an office dog while his brother continues to exercise with the other 131 dogs at the no-kill shelter.

Retirement-ready dogs at NH Sled Dog Rescue can be adopted for a fee of $250, part of which goes to supporting the shelter. This year they have about 40 dogs up for sale at their Jefferson, New Hampshire facility. 

Alaskan huskies can live to age 16.
