He may be a millionaire professional basketball player, but when it comes to Klay Thompson's finances, his parents have him on a short leash.

The Golden State Warriors guard, who is playing in just his second NBA season, learned a hard lesson after he was involved in an on-the-court skirmish on Tuesday night.

As a shoving match broke out between 
teammate David Lee and Indiana Pacers center Roy Hibbert, players from 
both teams joined in on the melee.

Scuffle: Golden State Warriors guard Klay Thompson, pictured holding the basketball, was fined $35,000 for his role in the on-the-court skirmish on Tuesday night

Trouble on the court: Indiana Pacers center Roy Hibbert, second from left, fights off Golden State players while Klay Thompson, right, approaches. He later shoved Hibbert into the stands

As referees tried in vain to break it up, Thompson could be seen shoving Hibbert into the stands.

His role in the brouhaha earned Thompson a $35,000 fine
from the NBA, but that amount is nothing compared to punishment he
received from his father, Mychal Thompson.

The elder Thompson, a former NBA player himself with the Portland Trailblazers and Los Angeles Lakers, was watching the game from home and was hoping his son would do the right thing.

In an interview with ESPN Radio on Wednesday, Mychal said: 'I was saying to myself, "don't do nothing stupid, don't do nothing stupid, now. Don't throw a punch, don't throw the ball at anybody."

Father and son: Mychal Thompson is a former Los Angeles Laker who now does commentary for the team, while his son plays guard for the Golden State Warriors

'When Roy Hibbert turned his back and he [said] "now's my chance" and hit him in the back with a shove.'

Rookie: Klay Thompson is in just his second NBA season

He admitted that he yelled 'you idiot!' at his TV.

The elder Thompson said that in addition to the NBA fine, he would also be cutting some money from his son's paycheck, which he has the power to do since the checks are made out to him.

He
said that he pays his Klay's bills, including $3,000 in rent, 
and leaves him about $300 a week 'to go to the movies and buy pizza.'

But Klay Thompson, who makes just over $2million a season, might be seeing a little less in his weekly allowance after Tuesday night.

It's not the first time Klay's father, who now works as a commentator with the Lakers, has been so outspoken about his son.

When Klay was suspended as a college hoops star after he was cited for having marijuana on him during a traffic stop in 2011, he was suspended from the team and forced to miss the final game of the season.

Taking to the radio airwaves the next day, Mychal Thompson said: 'He told I thought he was better than that. I want to hug my son and I want to punch his lights out. Or do both,' according to the Los Angeles Times.

He added: 'I'm just so mad. Maybe heâ€™s too old to be spanked, just turning 21 a month ago, but I sure feel like spanking him.'
