Eurostar was last night facing a multi-million pound compensation bill as thousands of passengers were left stranded in London and Paris after a fire shut the Channel Tunnel.

The train company, which operates services from St Pancras station in London to continental Europe, apologised to passengers after it had to cancel 26 trains – each capable of carrying up to 750 people – when a lorry caught fire at the French end of the north cross-Channel tunnel, shortly after 11am.

Services on the Le Shuttle car and freight service, operated by Eurotunnel between Folkstone and Calais, were also cancelled but were expected to resume last night.

Eurostar said discommoded passengers could claim £150 for hotel accommodation and £50 for food for every 24 hours they were delayed and advised that people could rebook or claim a refund

However, Eurostar said its passenger services would not be running again until today at the earliest. In a statement yesterday, it apologised, adding: ‘If you were planning to travel today, we advise you to postpone your journey and not come to the station.’

A spokesman said passengers could rebook their tickets or get a refund if necessary. It also said it was paying for hotel accommodation at £150 per night and letting stranded passengers claim £50 towards food for every 24 hours they were delayed.

He added that at this stage he was unable to say how big the compensation bill would be.

Angry travellers took to social media to complain. Grace Caffyn tweeted: ‘Train back to London delayed due to #Eurostar fire – currently waiting with crowd of Brits at nearest Ibis [hotel].’

And political assistant Amy Rogers wrote: ‘Quite good chance I may be stranded in Paris.’

Last night Kent police confirmed the lorry fire was not being treated as sinister. A spokesman said: ‘The fire was at the French end of the tunnel and is being dealt with by the French authorities. There are no reported injuries.’

In 2008, a fire on a lorry being carried to France meant the tunnel was closed for two days and normal service was not resumed for nearly four months, while in 2012 another truck fire left the tunnel closed for two hours.
