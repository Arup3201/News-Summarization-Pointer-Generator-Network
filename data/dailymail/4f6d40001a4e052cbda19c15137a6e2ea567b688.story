Scott Cam is the most popular personality on Australian television.

The Block host picked up the Gold Logie for Most Popular Personality at the 56th annual awards ceremony held in Melbourne on Sunday night.

The loveable Australian was presented with his trophy by Kylie Minogue, the builder-turned TV star joked after receiving a kiss from the pop princess that his Logies night had been 'pretty good'.

Double trouble! The Block host Scott Cam picked up the Gold Logie for Most Popular Personality on TV for 2014, as well as Most Popular Presenter

Very Australian: The builder-turned-presenter described his wife as a 'corker' and asked 'Can I have a beer now?' to wrap his eight minute acceptance speech

Accepting his second award for the night after also winning the Silver Logie for Most Popular Presenter, the down-to-earth star was sure to share the praise with the crew and creators of The Block.

'I'm not here without a show like The Block,' he modestly admitted.

'I'm so lucky [the show's creators] asked me to look after it for them. And I need to thank the whole Block family.'

Proud as punch: The loveable host was careful to thank The Block 'family', as well as his mother, wife and children after accepting the gong

Proud: The Block host posed with wife Ann and his two Logies after the ceremony

Give us a kiss: The loveable larrikin was more than happy to joke around with his two hefty prizes

Overcome by emotion, the father-of-three had to clear his throat as he made mention of his mother, who has been ill, as well as his children and wife.

'My three beautiful kids Charlie, Bill and Sarah are with my mum right now, I know they'll be going 'berko', he said, using the Australian slang for 'bezerk'.

'They're just such beautiful kids and they make my wife and I look like really good parents,' he said, eliciting laughs from the audience.

Disbelief: Scott put his hands over his face as his name was read out and the audience began to applaud

Congratulations: Scott's wife Ann planted a kiss on him before he headed up on stage

In what became a very typically Australian address, he also described his wife Ann as a 'corker', and wrapped his speech by asking 'Can I have a beer now?'

In the press room after the ceremony the 52-year-old said his down-to-earth demeanour was behind his ever-growing popularity.

'I think Aussies like good old fashioned Aussies, doing normal stuff,' he said.

A kiss from Kylie: Scott was handed his award by pop princess Kylie Minogue

'I try to be myself the whole time and I don’t try to be someone else, because I have been rehearsing that for 52 years.’

Asher Keddie was the other star of the evening, winning two Silver Logies.

The Offspring star picked up Most Outstanding Actress, and also won Most Popular Actress earlier in the night.

Close: Asher's Offspring co-star Kat Stewart congratulated her after the announcement  

The stunning blonde, who recently wed artist Vincent Fantauzzo in a secret ceremony in Fiji, graciously accepted the gong for her role as Nina Proudman in the Channel Ten drama series.

'All I can say is I'm so honoured to be part of this group of women [fellow nominees] ... amazing,' she said to cheers from the audience.

'Oh my god, amazing. I watch you all, I love you all and you inspire me.'

Glowing: The actress just returned from a secret wedding ceremony in Fiji where she wed artist husband Vincent Fantauzzo

Asher made special mention of her Offspring co-star Kat Stewart.

'I have to make mention of Kat, my acting partner of the last few years, you are remarkable,' she gushed.

'You blow my mind every day on set, I am so proud of you and I absolutely share this with you.'

Most Popular New Talent went to Home And Away's Bonnie Sveen.

Role model for women: Home And Away's Bonnie Sveen accepted the award for Most Popular New Talent

Role model: The blonde beauty, who walked the red carpet with Home And Away co-star Kyle Pryor said she was proud to be a realistic representation of women on Australian TV  

In her acceptance speech the curvacious blonde said 'It's progressive of the commercial TV industry to accept a healthier, more natural looking woman on their screens.'

She told the MailOnline she was proud to represent realistic women on Australian television.

‘I think it is important to differentiate storytellers from models,' she explained.

'People at home are able to turn on the television and see someone with an achievable look, or that is at least more of a mirror of themselves.

Controversial: Karl Stefanovic pushed the limit when he made a joke about Home And Away stars 'snorting No-Doz', possibly referring to Johnny Ruffo's recent drug scandal

'I think it does a lot of good to the attitudes of young women to see someone so comfortable in themselves.'

The most controversial moment of the night would have to go to Karl Stefanovic.

The Today host was on stage presenting an award with fellow media personality Amanda Keller when Keller, commenting on their early starts as TV presenters, joked: 'We picked a bad day to give up snorting No Doz,' referring to the caffeine stimulant used to prolong brain activity.

Taking her lead, the 39-year-old hit the ground running and said loudly: 'How good is snorting No Doz?'

Absent: Chris Lilley was overseas for the Melbourne awards ceremony but the eccentric Jamie: Private School Girl actor made his acceptance speech via a pre-recorded video message

On Chris Lilley's behalf: Jamie: Private School Girl actor Albert Mambo accepted the award in character

Grinning he went on to quip: 'I was just talking to the Home And Away kids in the toilet and they were saying the exact same thing.'

Chris Lilley won the Silver Logie for Most Popular Actor.

The Jamie: Private School Girl actor could not be at the ceremony due to commitments in London, so he accepted the award via a pre-recorded video message and sent one of the show's cast, actor Albert Mambo up in character.

Line-up: Footie commentators Bo Scott, Michael Slater, Paul Vautin and Erin Molan

Star studded event: Members of the Home And Away cast gathered for a group shot

'Kwame' had the audience in stitches when he accepted the award with just two words: 'Thank you'.

My Kitchen Rules was the winner in the Most Popular Reality TV Programme category.

Judge Manu Feildel said he wasn't expecting to win.

'I was just waiting at the table just expecting someone else,' he told MailOnline.
