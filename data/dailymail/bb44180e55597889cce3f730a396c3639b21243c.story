Blunder: Victoria Harrison, 17, slowly bled to death in her hospital bed after an artery was severed during a routine appendix operation at Kettering General Hospital

A hospital which suppressed details of the blunders that led to a teenage girl’s death to avoid causing stress to staff was forced to back down yesterday.

Victoria Harrison, 17, slowly bled to death in her hospital bed after an artery was severed during a routine appendix operation.

The trainee hairdresser texted a picture of her blood-soaked T-shirt to her boyfriend shortly before she died.

An inquest in December was told that Kettering General Hospital had uncovered 43 errors in the teenager’s care.

But the Northamptonshire hospital insisted that publishing details of the blunders could ‘endanger the mental health’ of their staff.

It released the internal report to Victoria’s devastated father Andrew Harrison, 57, and mother Tracy Foskett, 42, but said it had a right to withhold information from the public. Details were released – with staff names redacted – after the BBC appealed under the Freedom of Information Act against the hospital’s refusal to release its findings.

An internal panel agreed it was in the public interest to reveal the mistakes and the report’s recommendations.

The report says staff did not check Miss Harrison’s abdomen, routine observations were discontinued, there was no formal pain assessment, there was inaccurate recording of her resuscitation, the wrong surgeon was named on documentation and nurses’ conduct was unprofessional. It reveals that ten staff were disciplined, but none dismissed.

The case comes after recent assurances from Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt that whistleblowers will be protected as part of efforts to create a culture of ‘openness and transparency’ in the NHS, which the minister said was vital to prevent a repeat of the Mid Staffordshire scandal where up to 1,200 patients died needlessly.

Mrs Foskett, from Irthlingborough, Northamptonshire, yesterday called on all hospitals to publish such information to help prevent other tragedies from occurring. She said the hospital had initially told her ‘it would be better to keep the report private’ and that publication of parts of the report would compromise her daughter’s dignity.

‘Victoria hasn’t got any dignity now,’ she said. ‘She’s dead, they took all that away from her. What about my mental health? I have lost my shadow, my youngest daughter.

‘The public have the right to know what happened. My daughter should not die in vain.’

Victoria was given an emergency referral by her GP, who suspected appendicitis, in August 2012 . The surgeon realised he had damaged an artery during surgery and rectified the issue but Miss Harrison lost more than half a pint of blood. She texted her boyfriend with the picture to say she was bleeding later that day, but not all nursing staff were aware of the bleed and some did not routinely read medical notes.

Despite complaining of being in pain nurses gave her morphine until she suffered heart failure and died. Northamptonshire Coroner Ann Pember’s narrative verdict criticised the hospital over missed opportunities and said, had these been acted upon, ‘the outcome may have been very different.’

Peter Walsh, from the patient safety charity Action against Medical Accidents, said the hospital’s original decision to suppress the report did not help public confidence and ran against the requirement for spirit of openness and transparency highlighted by the Mid Staffordshire scandal.

The hospital has disclosed an action plan relating to each of the 43 errors.
