MATT LAWTON: Malky Mackay and Iain Moody investigated by FA over 'sexist, racist and homophobic' text messages during time at Cardiff 

Harry Redknapp has admitted that he gets sent 'sick' and 'stupid' text messages all the time and insists that Malky Mackay deserves his second chance at Wigan.

Wigan have offered Mackay a route back into football just three months after Sportsmail revealed that the Football Association had been handed a dossier of evidence accusing Mackay and Iain Moody of sending a shocking series of racist, anti-semitic, sexist and homophobic text messages.

It was a controversial decision taken by Wigan chairman Dave Whelan, but Redknapp is adamant that Mackay should be given another chance.

The Scotsman took charge of his first training session on Thursday morning

'I would ask people to judge me when they see me. I've apologised for my mistakes I've studied diversity and that's something that's ongoing.

'It has been a difficult period and I have made mistakes. I hope that in my time at Wigan, the people of Wigan and the supporters see who I am and see that I'm someone that desperately wants the club to do well.' 

Redknapp said: 'I get stupid messages from people all the time, silly jokes, sick jokes, I hate them and delete them straight away. But people do tend to do that in life, so he is not the only person who has made a mistake.

'I am sure his life has been hell for the last few months. He realises he has made a massive mistake and hopefully he will not make any more mistakes.

'I am not condoning what he done but he has got another chance. People get second chances in life. Have a look around the world and see what happens, there are people who come out of prison who have murdered people, beat up old ladies - they get second chances.

Mackay keeps a close eye on training as he takes charge of first session since his appointment 

'I have got a lot of time for Malky, I like him. He has made a mistake but lots of people make mistakes in life. Half the people who judge him have probably made more mistakes. 

'It is easy to kick someone when they are down. He has got a second chance now. He has got the backing of the chairman and hopefully he will do well.'

Whelan revealed on Wednesday at Mackay's unveiling that there is a clause in his contract protecting the club if the FA charge him. The FA's investigation is still two or three weeks from conclusion and Redknapp warns that Mackay cannot make the same mistake twice.

'If he does it again he'll be bang in trouble. He knows that,' Redknapp added. 'Whenever I have met Malky, I have thought he was a decent person and a good football manager. He made a big mistake, you can't do what he did, and he has accepted that. He has apologised I am sure he has learned from that.'

'Fkn chinkys. Fk it. There's enough dogs in Cardiff for us all to go around.'
