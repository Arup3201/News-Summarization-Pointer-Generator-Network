He spoke for all dog lovers when he revealed his grief at losing his beloved Labrador, Inca.

Now TV presenter Ben Fogle has broken ranks with them by saying that the BBC was right to axe the popular show Crufts because of the over-breeding of pedigree dogs.

Mr Fogle, who presented the popular show between 2006 and 2008, said he doesn’t agree with the breed requirements set by the Kennel Club, who own the franchise.

He said: ‘I don’t mind saying that I am glad we stopped coverage of Crufts until the Kennel Club change their standards because breeding shouldn’t all be about aesthetics and looks, it should be about health’.

Happy memories: In July, the 38-year-old presenter admitted that he 'couldn't stop crying' after he was forced to put down Inca. They are pictured in 2001

The BBC dropped Crufts from their coverage in 2009 after not being able to agree to the breeding terms with the Kennel Club.

The decision came shortly after a BBC documentary which claimed that over-breeding had caused major health problems in breeds including bulldogs, boxers and pugs.

In July, the 38-year-old presenter admitted that he ‘couldn’t stop crying’ after he was forced to put down his 12-year-old Labrador, Inca.

The loveable dog, which had epilepsy, was Mr Fogle’s trusty sidekick and was with him when he got his first television break.

Twelve years ago, Mr Fogle was selected to be one of 36 unknowns to spend a year on the Island of Taransay for the BBC reality show Castaway in 2000.

Allowed one luxury, he opted to bring Inca, whom he had bought as a puppy for £1,500, picking name that was inspired by his travels in South America.

And Mr Fogle, who also met his wife Marina when he was out walking with Inca, revealed that he believed the Labardor’s illness was ‘pretty much unquestionably’ down to his pedigree breeding.

Speaking to Dogs Today magazine, Mr Fogle confessed that he is still coming to terms with Inca’s loss.

He said: ‘I described Inca as my shadow and, although I like to think about my relationship with Inca was deeper than anyone else’s because she helped me find a job and a wife, I am aware that my story is mirrored all across the UK and all across the world’.

Last month, Mr Fogle released a book the Accidental Naturalist.

In the self-penned memoir which he 
describes as a ‘eulogy’ to Inca, the TV star said he wanted to encourage
people not to feel shy about grieving for an animal.

He said: ‘The brutal reality is that we all outlive our dogs and we will all go through this bereavement.

'I
wanted to share my experience to help people I suppose, so that people 
understand that you shouldn’t be embarrassed to grieve’.

And Mr Fogle added that the unique kind of grief that follows the death of an animal can be difficult to comprehend.

He said: ‘If you’re not an animal person, if you’re not a dog owner, it is hard to understand how a fluffy, furry creature on four legs, who can’t talk, can have this effect on you’.
