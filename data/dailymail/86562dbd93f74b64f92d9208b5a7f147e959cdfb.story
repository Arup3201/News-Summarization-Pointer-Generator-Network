This is the heartwarming moment a wide-eyed kitten is left utterly bewildered when he sees snow for the very first time. 

The tabby cat named Zoofi was filmed at home in Scotland when icy flakes started to drift by a first-floor window.

As the icicles fall down, the feline attempts to pounce on them through the glass. His frustration mounts when he's unable to get his paws on the white stuff.

In a bid to get a closer look at the wintry weather outside he runs along to another section of the window.

He also gets up on his hind legs to investigate.

YouTube user Scdon123, who videoed the scene, said Zoofi was mesmerized by the snow.

He apparently spent a good while observing the downpour before deciding he'd had enough.

Another added: 'Awww! Mine have been fascinated with the snowflakes. 

'They get up in the window and jump around trying to catch them. So cute!'
