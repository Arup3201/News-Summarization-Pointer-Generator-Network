A crew of Saks Fifth Avenue employees have been arrested after going on a  $400,000 shopping spree at the luxury store using customers' credit cards.

The six members of staff treated themselves to hundreds of pairs of designer shoes and handbags through an elaborate scheme that fraudulently used the credit cards of at least 22 customers. 

According to the criminal complaint, police last week uncovered the scam and recovered a number of the stolen items from the ringleader's apartment in Queens, N.Y.

Tamara Williams, 36, is alleged to have stolen customers' credit card data from the store computers and then shared the information with five Saks sales associates.

It is thought she then gave her accomplices specific lists of what they should buy from the store with the stolen credit card information.

The five 'fake shoppers' would buy the high-priced goods using the unsuspecting customers’ credit information, the complaint stated.

Some of the items were returned to Saks and the charges were returned to fake accounts created by the suspects.

The crew were caught on surveillance footage carrying out the elaborate operation, and this was then shown to police.

The process was able to continue for four months until the group were caught on surveillance footage carrying out the elaborate operation, and this was then shown to police.

Williams' apartment was raided on Friday and police found 'over one hundred boxes of shoes... as well as many boxes of handbags and other merchandise', the criminal complaint stated.

Four men and one woman have been arrested in addition to Williams. Kris Rockson, 45; Jason Chance, 25; Michael Knight-Williams, 44; Michael Bright-Asante, 39, and Alaia Harrison, 20, have all been charged with grand larceny and identity theft.
