George Osborne was accused of performing a hasty U-turn last night after agreeing to cap sky-high rates charged by Wonga and other payday lenders.

The Chancellor rushed out plans for a ceiling on the cost of payday loans, which are expected to limit the maximum price of a loan to as little as 10 per cent of its value.

But senior Liberal Democrats accused him of having resisted a tougher crackdown for months, and claimed he decided to act only after realising he faced a likely defeat on the issue in Parliament.

Crackdown: Chancellor George Osborne said he wanted to end the 'legal extortion' of high interest rates imposed by payday lenders

Mr Osborne insisted there was growing 
evidence in support of the move, including the positive effects of a cap
brought into force in Australia.

‘We’ve always believed in properly 
regulated free markets where there is competition but consumers are 
protected,’ he said.

He 
denied charges of a U-turn, pointing out that Labour had done 
‘absolutely nothing’ to tackle payday lenders during their 13 years in 
office.

Rising Labour star 
Stella Creasy has led a long campaign for a legal limit on the amounts 
charged by payday lenders, which critics say can ramp up to as high as 
5,853 per cent a year if supposedly short-term loans are allowed to roll
on.

Pressure on the 
Government to intervene grew earlier this year when the Archbishop of 
Canterbury Justin Welby issued a fierce denunciation of the burgeoning 
industry.

Lib Dem leader 
Nick Clegg, Business Secretary Vince Cable and consumer minister Jo 
Swinson have been urging the Treasury to take a stronger stance ‘for 
quite a long while’, according to a senior Lib Dem source.

Labour MP Stella Creasy, who has led the successful campaign for a cap on sky-high charges by payday lenders, has carved out a higher profile for herself than most of the members of Ed Miliband’s shadow Cabinet.

To the irritation of some of her longer-serving colleagues, the 36-year-old Walthamstow MP, who entered Parliament in 2010, is increasingly tipped as a potential future party leader.

Some senior Labour MPs refer to her sarcastically as ‘Saint Stella’, while others in the shadow Cabinet mutter that she is not enough of a ‘team player’ ever to succeed as party leader.

As well as confronting payday lenders with a relentless zeal, Miss Creasy, who has a PhD, has also campaigned on the issue of Twitter abuse directed at women – reporting ‘trolls’ to the police.

One male Twitter user who called her a ‘dumb, blonde bitch’ received the response: ‘That’s dumb Dr blonde bitch to you, actually.’

Miss Creasy’s youthful appearance is once said to have prompted Tory minister Andrew Robathan to wonder what she was doing in a lift reserved for MPs, apparently because he assumed she was someone’s personal assistant.

A keen indie music fan, Miss Creasy once told applicants for a job as her Parliamentary assistant that ‘knowledge of mid and late 90s indie music is beneficial’.

‘It
has previously been blocked by the Conservatives, specifically the 
Treasury,’ the source said.

‘It has never been total opposition but 
there has been a real reluctance to look at mandating a cap.’

But
Tory sources said claims of resistance from Mr Osborne were ‘totally 
untrue’ and that Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith had been 
making the ‘moral case’ for intervention for months.

The
Lib Dem source claimed the Chancellor had caved in after being warned 
that the Government risked defeat in a vote due to be called in the 
Lords to amend the law to cap the cost of payday loans.

Lib
Dem peer Lord Sharkey proposed a maximum loan of £300, a cap on charges
of a maximum of 10 per cent of the loan value and a bar on people from 
having two or more loans at the same time. 

The
Government has already given the new Financial Conduct Authority the 
power to cap fees and rates on payday loans, but the Treasury is now to 
go further by placing an obligation on the regulator to use those 
powers.

Labour leader Ed Miliband used a speech earlier this month to accuse payday of targetting vulnerable people who are threatened and bullied when they get into financial trouble

The rules are to be included in the Banking Reform Bill, which is proceeding through Parliament.

‘The regulator will go away and decide what is the best form of cap,’ the Chancellor said.

Lord
Sharkey said he was ‘delighted’ by the move. ‘For far too long 
unscrupulous payday loan companies have been allowed to prey on some of 
the most vulnerable people in our society with impunity,’ he added.

‘Far
from leading to a reduction in access to credit, as the payday lenders 
are claiming this morning, evidence has shown that the volume of money 
lent to people actually increased after a regulatory system was put in 
place.

‘People need 
protection from the worst excesses of the payday loan companies, and I 
am glad that the Treasury has seen the light.’

WONGA

Typical APR 5853%

Signed a four-year deal to sponsor Newcastle United.

This
month hired a Bafta-nominated director to produce a film on the 
controversial company to counteract criticism about its huge profits and
sky-high interest rates.

CASH LADY

Typical APR 2670%

Courted controversy when it hired ex-bankrupt reality star Kerry Katona to front ad campaign.

But this summer the Atomic Kitten star declared herself bankrupt for the second time in five years due to unpaid debts.

Her money troubles led to her being dropped as the face of Cash Lady.

PAYDAY UK

Typical APR 2610%

Bought by US giant Dollar Financial in 2011 for a reported $195million.

It is now part of the same firm which owns The Money Shop, which has 550 stores nationwide.

QUICK QUID

Typical APR 1734%

Spent an estimated £3.2 million, advertising during programmes like Friends, Desperate Scousewives and Hollyoaks.

In July it apologised after sending emails threatening to send in debt collectors to people who had not borrowed money.

Allowing people to borrow a small amount of money for a short period of time is a legitimate and useful business.

But those who turn to payday loan firms are sometimes desperate and often disadvantaged.

What they need is protection.

What they have is the Wild West, with companies behaving as they please and charging what they like.

Charities are being swamped by calls from households who thought they would have to repay only a small amount after a few days, but have ended up with crippling debts.

Now, the Government is planning to cap the cost of payday loans.

Currently all companies that offer payday loans are supposed to state their annual percentage rate (APR).

For example, Wonga’s APR is 5,835 per cent.

This is for someone who borrowed £150 for 18 days.

They’d repay a total of £183.49 including interest and charges.

Details of the Government’s plan have not been revealed. Australia already has a cap.

There the maximum a lender can charge is a set-up fee equivalent to 20 per cent of the loan, plus 4 per cent a month.

This provides for maximum charges of $72 (£40) for a $300 (£170) borrowing over one month. But this is still an APR of 1,221 per cent.

Though high, it’s far cheaper than most in the UK.

A similar rule here will do little, however, to stop the perilous rolling over of debt and charges from one month to the next.

And capping APRs for payday lenders will do nothing to curb the high cost of short-term borrowing from banks.

An investigation by the Mail earlier this year found that the equivalent APR for an overdraft with some of Britain’s biggest banks was as high as 53million per cent when borrowing £200 for ten days.

Yet, banks are not forced to use APR for the cost of an overdraft. One solution may be to scrap the APR altogether – it is a complicated calculation not widely understood.

That would mean finding an alternative method of comparing total costs for loans taken over different lengths of time. An APR at least allows an indication of how expensive one type of loan is compared to another.

Perhaps the best solution, and that championed by Lib Dem peer Lord Sharkey, would be to cap the total size of a payday loan at £300 and cap charges at 10 per cent of the amount borrowed.

It’s a calculation that most borrowers could easily understand.

Add in other charges and ban the fees on debts that are rolled over, and the total amount to repay would be £333.

That’s three times cheaper than a similar loan at present in the UK.

In Florida, an identical set of rules has been in place for more than a decade and payday firms there still make a very healthy profit indeed.

Whatever the Government’s rules, the effect must be to slash the cost of short-term borrowing, because every penny that doesn’t make it into the pockets of payday lenders is cash that helps the desperate and indebted.
