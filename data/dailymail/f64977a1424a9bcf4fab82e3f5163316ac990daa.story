The city of Cleveland's police department is set to be overhauled after federal investigators concluded that officers use excessive and unnecessary force far too often and have endangered the public and their fellow officers with their recklessness.

A two-year investigation by the Justice Department, released on Thursday, found that Cleveland police use guns, Tasers, 'impact weapons,' pepper spray and their fists in excess, unnecessarily or in retaliation.

In some cases unnecessary force was 'in violation of the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution,' claimed the report.

Officers also use excessive force on those 'who are mentally ill or in crisis,' the Justice Department said.

Accountability, or the lack thereof, was a reoccurring theme of the report. Of the period reviewed, 2010-2013, the investigation found that officers were suspended on only six occasions for improper use of force.

'Discipline is so rare that no more than 51 officers out of a sworn force of 1,500 were disciplined in any fashion in connection with a use of force incident over a three-and-a half-year period,' the report said.

More disturbing was an admission by investigators carrying out reports into the use of deadly force that they always sought to show the officer involved in the best possible light.

'Deeply troubling to us was that some of the specially trained investigators who are charged with conducting unbiased reviews of officers' use of deadly force admitted to us that they conduct their investigations with the goal of casting the accused officer in the most positive light possible,' said the report.

Last week, hundreds of people blocked a Cleveland freeway at rush hour to protest those killings and the fatal shooting of Tamir Rice, a black 12-year-old boy, by a white officer outside a Cleveland recreation center

Cleveland Mayor Frank Jackson and the U.S. Justice Department signed an agreement on Thursday that said both sides will work toward the appointment of a court-appointed monitor to oversee reform.

'We understand the progress we seek will not come over night,' Attorney General Eric Holder said at a press conference to announce the findings.

The Justice Department found a systemic pattern of reckless and inappropriate use of force by officers and cited concerns about search-and-seizure practices. Jackson was among those who asked the department to conduct the inquiry.

It also said officers frequently violated people's civil rights because of faulty tactics, inadequate training and a lack of supervision and accountability.

Officers' excessive use of force has created deep mistrust in Cleveland, especially in the black community, the report concluded.

'We saw too many incidents in which officers accidentally shot someone either because they fired their guns accidentally or because they shot the wrong person,' the report said.

In November 2012 police officers fired 137 shots into a car killing 43-year-old driver Timothy Russell, left, and 30-year-old passenger Malissa Williams in the parking lot of a suburban middle school

The federal investigation was prompted by several highly publicized police encounters, chiefly the deaths of two unarmed people who were fatally wounded when police officers fired 137 shots into their car at the end of a high-speed pursuit in November 2012.

In that incident, the Justice Department said, police began chasing Timothy Russell and passenger Malissa Williams after officers and witnesses thought they heard a gunshot coming from their car as they drove by a court building.

The report said it now appears that what they heard was the car backfiring.

More than 100 officers engaged in a chase of the two unarmed suspects in violation of division policy. After a 25-minute chase that reached speeds of more than 100 mph and ended in an East Cleveland school parking lot, 13 officers fired 137 rounds hitting Russell and Williams more than 20 times each, the report said.

'The officers, who were firing on the car from all sides, reported believing that they were being fired at by the suspects. It now appears that those shots were being fired by fellow officers,' the Justice Department wrote.

The report comes amid inflamed tensions between police and residents in several cities where white officers have killed young blacks, including in New York City and Ferguson, Missouri.

All those events have raised urgent national questions about the sense of trust between police and communities, Holder said.

Last week, hundreds of people blocked a Cleveland freeway at rush hour to protest those killings and the fatal shooting of Tamir Rice, a black 12-year-old boy, by a white officer outside a Cleveland recreation center.

Cleveland police Chief Calvin Williams has defended Rice's shooting, saying he reached for an air pistol that was 'indistinguishable from a real firearm.'

The Justice Department has opened civil rights investigations into the practices of some 20 police departments in the past five years, and it is reviewing both the Ferguson police department and the chokehold death of Eric Garner, an unarmed black man in New York City.

It's also currently enforcing more than a dozen agreements to overhaul police department practices nationwide.

'We have seen in city after city where we have engaged that meaningful change is possible,' Holder said.

Cleveland and the Justice Department will begin negotiating an agreement that will be submitted to a federal judge outlining the scope of reforms, to include the appointment of an independent monitor.

A joint statement signed by city and federal officials said Cleveland's mayor, safety director and police chief 'will always retain full authority' to run the police department.

Jackson said on Thursday that the city disagreed with some of the facts and conclusion in the report, but he did not dispute the overall findings.

The report notes that the Justice Department first looked at Cleveland officers' use of deadly force in 2002 and that an agreement was reached two years later on how such policies would be changed. There was no court order or independent monitor assigned then.

The Justice Department began its investigation in March 2013 and reviewed nearly 600 use-of-force incidents - both lethal and not - that occurred between 2010 and 2013. The report notes that Cleveland police officials did not provide many of the documents sought by federal investigators.

Cleveland Police Chief Calvin Williams said the details of the 58-page report were difficult to hear.

'People of this city need to know we will work to make the police department better,' he said.
