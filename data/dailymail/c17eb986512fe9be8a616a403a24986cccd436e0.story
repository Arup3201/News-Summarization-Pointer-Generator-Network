It is believed that Jeffrey Bronken and his 15-year-old daughter were travelling to Florida for a spring break trip

Reports from the Pinellas County Sherrif's Office, in Florida, have been released confirming the teenager's death.

The family was first struck by tragedy in 2009 when it is believed that Jeffrey Bronken's daughter Christine was killed during a fatal snowmobile crash.

Christine Bronken's death was listed in records from the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources.

The trio, all from Chicago suburb Round 
Lake, were headed to nearby St Petersburg – Clearwater International 
Airport when the plane crashed around 4 a.m., WTSP reported.

Authorities told Bay News 9 that the single-engine Piper knocked out power to locals after clipping power lines on its way down.

The plane crashed on a busy six-lane road in the town of Safety Harbor, just across the bay from Tampa.

No other injuries were caused by the accident, and investigators have yet to determine a cause behind the crash.

Katherine Bronken fought for her life for four days before her tragic death last night

‘This happened at 4 a.m., so luckily, no one was on the road at that time in this vicinity,’ Pinellas County Sheriff's Office spokesman Sgt. David DiSano told Bay News 9.

The red and white plane left Chicago around 6.30 Friday night, officials said.

The National Transportation Safety Board said that Mr Bronken had reported a fuel problem to air traffic control before the plane went down.

The exact cause of the crash still remains unknown but the fuel problem is being investigated.

Best friends: Both Katherine Bronken (left) and Keyana Linbo (right) were aboard the flight. Miss Linbo is in a stable state at a Tampa hospital. Miss Bronken died on Wednesday

A neighbor of the Bronken’s confirmed to the Chicago Tribune that widow Susan Bronken was already headed to Florida.

A life-long friend of the family Ken Hoxie told WLS: 'It's a shock. It's a shame. It's a fantastic family.

'You don't understand sometimes why these things happen, all we can do is pray.'

People near the site of the crash described the sights and sounds that woke them early Saturday morning to the Tampa Bay Times.

Marina Brown, 20, said she heard a loud noise and saw a flash of light followed by sparks.

It looked like ‘fireworks shooting up from the ground,’ according to Mary Pronesti.

Bill Tregulas said it sounded ‘like a large guitar snapping.’

Another person told Bay News 9 that he head a ‘big boom,’ saw a flash of light and initially dismissed it as a thunder storm.

Emergency responders from several agencies responded quickly to the scene.

Both father and daughter died as a result of the crash. Widow Susan Bronken is believed to have travelled to Florida after the crash

Also injured: Keyana Linbo was also hurt. The 15-year-old is now in a stable state at a Tampa hospital

The cause of the crash which killed Jeffrey Bronken and his daughter Katherine is still under investigation

The aircraft never caught fire, but several small fires along the median where it came to rest nose-first with its tail in the air were put out by firefighters.

More than 1,100 households lost power immediately after the deadly crash, but that numbers was reduced to about 450 by 6 a.m. according to the Tampa Tribune.

The airport the trio was flying to is less than a mile from the scene.
