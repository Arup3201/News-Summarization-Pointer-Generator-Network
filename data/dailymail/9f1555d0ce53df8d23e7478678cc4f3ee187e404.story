Human traffickers are coaching young adult asylum seekers to act like children so they can claim more benefits when they reach Britain, a court has heard.

The claim emerged during a judicial review challenge brought by an Afghan asylum seeker who says he is 16, but is actually thought to be nearly 20.

The immigrant, whose identity has not been revealed due to a court order, claimed he was 14 when he arrived in Britain in 2009.

The claims emerged after an Afghan asylum seeker who claimed to be 16 took his case to the London High Court

However, social workers found his physical appearance to be like that of an adult who had been 'coached' to act younger than his years.

With taxpayer-funded legal help, he has now taken his case to the High Court, insisting his adult appearance is due to his 'ethnicity'.

The Afghan said learning difficulties mean he is entitled to a full-time British education until the age of 25.

The court heard age assessors from Ealing Borough Council interviewed the asylum seeker after his arrival in the UK and came to the conclusion that he was 'over 18'.

Their report stated: 'The social assessors were under the impression that he had been coached and that he was told not to have eye contact with the assessors and not to speak up or demand things from the department.'

Despite his shyness in interviews, he insisted on speaking to a lawyer as soon as he was placed with a foster family, and was later spotted chatting on a mobile phone, the court heard.

His claim for asylum was rejected in May 2010 after a tribunal found his evidence was 'self-serving and rehearsed'.

But his removal from Britain, originally planned for November 2010, has been put off after his lawyers challenged both the age assessment and the Home Office's decision to remove him.

Child migrants have access to a larger range of benefits, which are not available to adults, and their young age can greatly improve the chances of them staying in Britain.

The Afghan migrant's barrister, Azeem Suterwalla, today told the court that Ealing's age assessment overlooked the impact of his ethnicity on his appearance, and youths in rural areas of the Middle East can develop more quickly than British children.

He also claimed his responses in interview were down to his learning difficulties, with his intelligence having since been found to be 'in the bottom one per cent of the population'.

The court was shown a report from an educational psychologist, which states: 'If he remains in the UK then his measured level of learning disabilities would entitle him to a full-time education until the age of 25.'

An Afghan identity document provided to support his age was described as 'mysterious' by Mrs Justice Lang, and cites his date of birth as 1374 in the Afghan calender, translated as being 1995.

After a day of legal argument, Mrs Justice Lang reserved her decision on the case and will now give her ruling at an unspecified later date.
