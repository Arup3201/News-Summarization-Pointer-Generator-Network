Jodi Arias' legal defense has cost Arizona taxpayers more than $2.5 million - and the bill will continue to rise as prosecutors try for a second time to convince a jury to sentence her to death.  

Arias was convicted last year of brutally murdering her ex-lover Travis Alexander, but the jury could not agree on whether to sentence her to death. 

Prosecutors called for a second jury to re-examine Arias sentence. Jury selection began on Monday.

Maricopa County spokeswoman Cari Gerchick said Monday that defense lawyers Kirk Nurmi and Jennifer Willmott have billed the state for more than $2.5million for their fees and to pay for expert witnesses and other defense costs. 

Prosecutors have declined to say how much they have spent on the case. 

Shortly after Arias' arrest in July 2008, a judge found that she she was found unable to pay for her own defense and ordered that two court-appointed attorneys be hired to defend her. 

The shocking figure is dramatically higher than other high-profile cases. Casey Anthony's legal defense cost more than $275,000 - and taxpayers kicked in about $119,000 of that.

Mass-murderer Robert Stewart, who gunned down eight people in a North Carolina nursing home in 2009, cost the state $338,000 in defense costs - of which $229,000 went to his defense lawyers. 

Arias was convicted last year of the brutal 2008 murder of her ex-lover Travis Alexander. Prosecutors are trying to convince a jury to sentence her to death

Last year, it emerged that George Zimmerman, who shot dead unarmed teenager Trayvon Martin, says he spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on his defense and still carries a $2.5million debt from legal fees. 

Last October, after she was convicted of murder, Arias sent the judge in her case a hand-written 12-page letter in which she called Mr Nurmi incompetent and asked to fire him from her defense team. 

She claimed that he had an 'utter poverty of people skills' and had not provided an effective defense. 

Arias' charge came despite her defense team sowing enough doubt among jurors in the highly-publicized case that they could not agree to sentence her to death.  

Prosecutors have one more shot with a new jury to secure the death penalty, otherwise Arias will face life in prison. 

Jury selection began The case is expected to last into December.
