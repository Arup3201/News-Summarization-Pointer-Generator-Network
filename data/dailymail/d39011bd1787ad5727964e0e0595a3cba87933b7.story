A Florida Army veteran accused of stabbing to death a stranger sent a text message an hour after the deadly altercation admitting to the alleged crime, it was revealed in court Thursday.

John Orr, 39, is facing a second-degree murder charge in the October 2011 killing of 63-year-old Jon Wayne Joseph in Naples. 

Orr told police after his arrest that he was acting in self-defense because Joseph rammed him with a bicycle, pinned him to the ground and bashed his head after the two exchanged some words.

Investigators say Orr pulled a pocketknife on Joseph and plunged it into his body 75 times. At the time of his arrest, Orr was covered in blood, Naples Daily News reported. 

In court Thursday, detective Robert Young, who led the investigation into the killing, read a text message sent by Orr to a friend saying: 'I think I just killed a guy, stabbed him.'

Another text read: 'This isn't good.'

The jury panel also heard from Joseph's live-in girlfriend, Roseann Hannigan, who testified that it all started when on October 3, 2011, Orr approached her in the driveway as she was drinking beer with Joseph and asked after his friend Bert Newcombe.

Hannigan replied that no one by that name lived there, and Orr took his leave after apologizing for making a mistake.

But Hannigan said that as Orr was walking away, she overheard him utter the words, 'bitch,' 'whore' and 'liar.'

The name-calling prompted Joseph to mount his bike and go after Orr, but Hannigan insisted in court that the 63-year-old did not appear angry - just frustrated.

Grisly scene: Joseph was found lying on the ground in the Lake Park section of Naples, Florida, October 2011 after suffering 75 knife wounds

The woman told the court that her boyfriend’s last words to her were, 'Hon, I'll be right back. I'm going to see what's going on.' She never saw him alive again.

In his testimony Thursday, Orr's friend Colby Meeks said he was on the phone with the retired soldier when Joseph confronted him, telling the man never to come back.

Meeks added that Joseph sounded 'confrontational,' and he then heard the sounds of a brawl.

‘I could hear just, fighting basically, and at that point, John said, you know, “Don’t ever try that trick on me again” and I heard a gasping voice say, “OK, I won’t, I won’t,”’ Meeks told the jurors.

Defense strategy: Orr told police he was in fear for his life because Joseph pinned him down and bashed his head into the ground

The witness recalled that at that point he hung up because he said it sounded like Orr had the upper hand in the fight.

At a pre-trial hearing in 2012, Orr claimed that his opponent, nearly 30 years his senior, got on top of him, bashed his head into the ground and threatened to kill him.

Orr's attorney, Mike McDonnell, attempted to use Florida's controversial 'stand your ground' doctrine to secure immunity for his client saying that Joseph was in control of the situation and Orr was in fear for his life.

The presiding judge, however, rejected the motion based on physical evidence, namely blood splatter, being inconsistent with Orr's version of events.

Prosecutor Andreas Gardiner pointed out to the jury Thursday that the victim was an elderly man who was unarmed. He suffered 75 knife wounds, while Orr had no injuries to support his head-bashing story.

Orr’s attorney said the 39-year-old defendant will take the stand later in the trial. If convicted of second-degree murder, Orr could face a life in prison.

The trial is expected to conclude next Wednesday or Thursday, after which the case will go to the jury for deliberations.
