Lionel Messi took matters into his own hands and delivered Argentina's team talk following a goalless 90 minutes against Holland.

Manager Alejandro Sabella began the chat but Messi soon took over as his team-mates listened intently.

And although his side couldn’t muster a win in extra time, they edged out Holland 4-2 on penalties to reach Sunday’s final in Rio de Janeiro.

Having scored four goals in the tournament before the semi-final clash in Sao Paulo, Messi had a quiet game against the Dutch.

With the score line still blank after 105 minutes, the captain seemed subdued as the Barcelona forward left the next team talk in the hands of Sabella.

Indeed, it was his Barcelona team-mate Javier Mascherano who was the most animated player, appearing to put his hand up in his manager’s face. He again stepped up to speak to his fellow players before penalties.

Holland and Aston Villa defender Ron Vlaar had kept the dangerous Argentina front line quiet as both teams battled for a place in the final against Germany.

Messi was perhaps missing the creative influence of Angel di Maria who missed the game through injury.
