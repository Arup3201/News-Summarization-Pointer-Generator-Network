Embattled Culture Secretary Maria Miller has been insulted on her own department's official Twitter account.

Whitehall officials believe hackers managed to infiltrate the Department of Culture, Media and Sport's account @DCMS - which has 55,000 followers - just after 7.30pm yesterday.

At least three messages were posted which said: 'Seriously though guys which one of us hasn't embezzled and cheated the taxpayer?? #FreeMariaMiller.

Messages: The posts on the Department of Culture, Media and Sport account were swiftly deleted

Apology: Maria Miller was made to read out a statement for 32 seconds in the Commons on Thursday

'@Maria_MillerMP is like a modern day Robin Hood, she robs the poor to help the rich.

'Is @Maria_MillerMP guilty? We will let the public decide.'

A department spokesman told MailOnline: 'It's been hacked, as far as we know, and we are investigating.

'We have absolutely no idea how it could have happened at the moment. We have got our technical team looking into it.'

The spokesman added there was no indication as to whether the hack had originated from inside or outside the department.

Mrs Miller made a 32-second apology to Parliament on Thursday after a 16-month inquiry into her expenses claims found she had frustrated investigators.

A report by the Commons standards committee concluded she should repay £5,800 overclaimed on her mortgage in 2009.

Under fire: The Culture Secretary leaves the House of Commons after her apology to MPs on Thursday

She had designated a house in Wimbledon, south west London, as her 'second home', claiming a rented cottage in her Hampshire constituency was her main residence.

But critics felt that because her parents lived in the Wimbledon house, it should be designated as her main residence.

The Culture Secretary bought the property with her solicitor husband Iain for £234,000 in 1995, and taxpayers were billed for the interest on the mortgage for four years from 2005 – the year Mrs Miller became MP for Basingstoke.

Taxpayers would not have been billed for the interest in the same way if she had designated it as her main home.

The couple then sold the Wimbledon house in February for £1.47million, making a profit of £1.2million.

Mrs Miller, a 50-year-old mother of three, was appointed Culture Secretary and minister for women and equality in a 2012 Cabinet reshuffle.
