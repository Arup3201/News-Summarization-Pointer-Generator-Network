Defending champions Chelsea cruised into the fifth round of the FA Youth Cup with a 6-1 thrashing of Huddersfield Town on Tuesday night.

The Blues took an early lead through Tammy Abraham and didn't look back, the forward adding the second and Dominic Solanke scoring the first of his three before the half-hour mark.

The Terriers reduced the arrears thanks to Jamie Spencer, but Solanke and another from Kasey Palmer rounded off a straightforward victory at Aldershot.

Chelsea will now face a home tie against either Swansea City or Doncaster Rovers in the next round.

The hosts had beaten Leeds United 2-0 in the last round, while Huddersfield caused a minor shock in beating Premier League Crystal Palace by the same scoreline.

Fielding an attacking line-up, Chelsa were quickly into their stride and had the lead after just five minutes.

Jay Dasilva advanced down the left flank before crossing to the back post where Abraham skilfully directed a header back across the keeper and into the net for his 20th goal of the season.

Solanke came close to doubling Chelsea's lead, while Huddersfield stopper Tadhg Ryan had to produce a save to deny Ola Aina.

It was akin to a siege at times and it came as little surprise when Chelsea doubled their lead just before the half-hour.

Huddersfield failed to clear their lines from a corner and Abraham was left with a simple finish from close range.

Three minutes later, Chelsea extended their lead with Abraham turning provider. He got beyond left-back Jack Senior and crossed low for Solanke to convert from just a few yards out.

The persistence of Spencer meant the Yorkshire side reduced the deficit on 35 minutes after he charged down a clearance from Chelsea goalkeeper Bradley Collins.

But it was merely a brief reprieve for the Championship visitors - Jeremie Boga waltzed past three defenders before crossing from the byline for Solanke to score from close range to make it 4-1 at the break.

With Chelsea's progress pretty much assured, they eased off in the second half but still managed to add another couple of goals.

The in-form Solanke pounced on a loose ball inside the Huddersfield box to fire home left-footed, his seventh goal in his last three appearances.

Palmer finished Chelsea's night with a flourish, smashing the ball into the top corner with three minutes left.
