A 92-year-old grandmother died after waiting five hours for an ambulance to turn up following four 999 calls only to arrive at hospital and wait another 14 hours in A&E for a bed.

Bridget Forde, a former nurse and devoted church-goer, was left lying in agony on a freezing floor after injuring her hip in a fall at her home in Muswell Hill, north London.

Her daughter Helen raised the alarm with emergency services but was forced to watch her mother drift in and out of consciousness for several hours as they waited for paramedics to turn up.

Ms Forde rang 999 a total of four times over a five-hour period until an ambulance eventually arrived at the property to take her mother to hospital. 

Bridget Forde, 92, was left lying in agony for four hours after a delay in getting an ambulance to her when she injured her hip in a fall. After being taken to hospital, she waited 14 hours for a bed and died six days later

Ms Forde, who is almost blind, said she was repeatedly told by operators that no emergency help was available.

Paramedics were said to be 'shocked' at the elderly grandmother's condition when they eventually arrived at her home last month.

The former nurse and care worker was taken to Whittington Hospital in Archway, north London, but was forced to wait another 14 hours in A&E for a bed to become available.

She died of pneumonia just six days later.

Now, Ms Forde, from Hampstead, has said she would rather 'end my life than grow old in the UK' after claiming the slow ambulance response time and 'in crisis' NHS were to blame for her mother's death.

She said: 'The last terrible memory I have of my mother is of her lying on that cold floor in agony.

'It's something I can never nor forget.

'My mum was such a lovely lady - a committed Christian who loved her neighbours more than herself.

'As a nurse, child minder and then carer for the elderly, she spent her entire life looking after others.

'She lived here for 50 years and was the kind of person who would always help others.

'She was so loved that her grateful community gave her an "outstanding neighbour" award.

'But when she needed help herself she was treated like an animal.

'It is clear the NHS is in crisis and it's high time the political point-scoring and fingerpointing stop.

'I have no children of my own to help look after me when I'm old and seeing what happens to the elderly in today's NHS has been truly terrifying.

'When I'm 80, I'm tempted to head to Switzerland [where euthanasia is legal].'

Ambulance waiting times across London have got increasingly worse over the last nine months, with the borough of Haringey being the hardest   hit.

Of the delay in getting paramedics to Mrs Forde, a London Ambulance Service spokesman said: 'We were extremely busy and are very sorry for the delay and for any further distress this will have caused.'

A Whittington Health Trust spokesman added: 'We would like to express our sincere condolences to the family of Ms Forde.

'In common with other NHS trusts we are experiencing high demand for our services.

'We endeavoured to make Ms Forde as comfortable as possible while she was in A&E, and kept her under close and regular observation.'
