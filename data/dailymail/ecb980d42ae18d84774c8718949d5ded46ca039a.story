President Obama's party is nervous that he might face impeachment proceedings â€“ or at least it wants potential donors to think so.

The Democratic National Committee send a fundraising email on Saturday, titled 'Impeachment,' that warned several Republicans have raised the spectre of a move to bounce the president from office.

'Republicans are actually excited about the idea,' the email said. 'Show these Republicans that they are way, way off base and give President Obama a Congress that has his back.'

The email was sent to supporters of Obama For America, the president's political campaign organization, The Daily Caller reported, and sought contributions for 2014 congressional campaigns.

It featured quotes from Oklahoma Sen. James Inhofe, Minnesota Rep. Michele Bachmann, Michigan Rep. Kerry Bentivolio, and Texas Rep. Blake Farenthold, all Republicans who have openly used what Democrats call 'The "I" word.'

Feeling the heat, but it's just Hawaii: Barack Obama is vacationing while his political party floats the threat of impeachment as a fundraising tool

President Bill Clinton denied allegations of a sexual relationship with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky in 1998, and his similar denials in sworn testimony led to his impeachment

Rep. Blake Farenthold (L) predicted that an impeachment vote against Obama would pass easily in the House of Representatives, and  Rep. Kerry Bentivolio (R) salivated about writing the articles of impeachment

Only two U.S. presidents have been impeached: Andrew Johnson and Bill Clinton. Neither was convicted of his charges in the U.S. Senate, a step that's necessary before a president can be removed from office,

In February 1999, after Clinton easily won acquittal on a perjury charge and dodged conviction for obstruction of justice by a single vote, Democrats linked arms and sang the civil-rights anthem 'We Shall Overcome' on the steps of the U.S. Capitol.

Clinton was impeached for lying under oath about an extramarital affair he carried on with a young White House intern.

Obama's troubles, by contrast, are more the stuff of political scandal than of legal jeopardy.

His State Department staff altered CIA-approved talking points that named the terrorist group behind a 2012 attack that killed four Americans in Benghazi, Libya. Tea party groups and other conservatives were targeted for harassment by his Internal Revenue Service beginning in 2010, a program that was later covered up.

Both of those choices, Republicans say, were calculated efforts to secure Obama's re-election in 2012.

The Democratic Party sent out an email with infographics raising the spectre of an Obama impeachment and using the idea to raise money

Obama 'has committed impeachable offenses,' said Rep. Michele Bachmann, the tea party darling that Democrats love to hate

Obama is also under fire for lying to the American public with his assurances that they could keep existing health insurance plans and doctor-patient relationships under the Affordable Care Act.

And his Department of Justice repeatedly spied on journalists, including some at Fox News and the Associated Press, in an effort to ferret out the source of national security leaks.

As Obama struggles to change the subject from Obamacare to jobs and the economy, the Democratic Party is focused on the 2014 congressional elections.

They need to flip 17 Republican seats into their column in order to take back control of the House of Representatives, an outcome that no national pollster has suggested is possible.

But Republicans stand a chance of taking over the Senate, something that would require victory in 6 of the 20 races where Democratic incumbents are defending their seats. The GOP would also have to hang on to the 15 Republican-held seats that are up for grabs.

Texas congressman Steve Stockman warned in 2013 that he would move to impeach the president if he introduced new gun 'unconstitutional' gun-control measures

Conservatives have kept the idea of an Obama impeachment alive since his early years in office, beginning with so-called 'birthers' who believe he is foreign-born and ineligible to be president

Daily Beast columnist Michael Tomasky, a liberal Democrat, warned this year that the Benghazi affair is 'a potential impeachment issue as long as the Republicans are in control of the House'

Fox News host and former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee predicted in May that the president 'will not serve out his full term.'

At present, however, no member of 
Congress has officially filed articles of impeachment against President 
Obama.

A group of conservative lawmakers did, however, file papers 
to impeach Attorney General Eric Holder in November. That bill has not 
yet had a hearing.
