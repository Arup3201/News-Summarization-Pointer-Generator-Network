Prince Harry could not help but grin widely this afternoon as he watched England beat their old enemies Australia at Twickenham.

Dressed in a smart suit and red tie, the Royal cheered the home side to victory during the first game of the Autumn Internationals, which saw the national team win 20-13.

He could be seen frowning at first, as Stuart Lancaster's men gave a poor performance in the first half against their Southern Hemisphere rivals.

Try! Prince Harry cannot help but grin as he watches England beat Australia in the first Autumn International

Smart: Wearing a red tie and suit, he cheers on from the stands as Owen Farrell's try seals the victory for the home side

But his grimace soon turned to smiles as the team, led by captain Chris Robshaw, dominated the 
second half and came away with the win.

The fourth-in-line to the throne, who is the Vice Patron of the Rugby Football Union, applauded as tries from fly half Owen Farrell and 
Robshaw set up the victory.

He is a regular at England's home of rugby, and has often been spotted in the stands with his brother Prince William.

Before the game, he chatted with guests who had joined him in the Royal Box and spoke to fans who were sat in front of him.

It is the second time the Prince has 
visited Twickenham in recent weeks, after his first event as Patron of 'All Schools', the Rugby Football Union's initiative to get 
state school children into the sport.

On the pitch, Farrell endured a mixed afternoon, missing three of his seven attempts from the kicking tee, but he recovered well, producing the match-winning touch down in the 58th minute.

The win means the home side retain third position in the world rankings.

England's
2003 World Cup-winning squad performed a lap of honour at half-time with the likes of Johnny Wilkinson and Martin Johnson celebrating the 10-year anniversary of their triumph.

Turnaround: The Prince's grimace turned into a smile as England recovered from a 13-6 half-time deficit

Charity: The Royal was at the game as part of one of his public roles, the Vice Patron of the Rugby Football Union

Applause: He is a regular at Twickenham and has often attended with his brother, Prince William

Thinking: The Prince looks on as he chats with other guests in Twickenham's Royal Box
