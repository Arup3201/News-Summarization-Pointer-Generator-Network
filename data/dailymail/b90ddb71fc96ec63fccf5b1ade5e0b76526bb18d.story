A man who made international headlines as a 14-year-old for pretending to be a police officer for several hours and fooling his way into a squad car has been sentenced to prison for posing as a cop yet again.

Now 19, Vincent Richardson will spend 18 months behind bars after pleading guilty Thursday to false impersonation of a peace officer after trying to buy police clothing on July 23.

The Chicago man walked into VCG Uniform and told the salesman he was an Englewood District officer and needed a nylon duffel bag, cargo pants, blue duty shirt and duty belt.

Richardson, of the 6300 block of South Mansfield, was dressed in navy cargo pants and a white duty shirt that resembled what police wear and produced his drivers license.

However he abruptly left the store before completing the transaction.

The store employee searched Richardson's name on Google and discovered his infamy for impersonating an officer as a kid.

Catch Me If You Can: Vincent Richardson has been sentenced to 18 months prison after being caught impersonating a police officer while trying to buy an official uniform. It is the second such offense for the 19-year-old, who as a child spent at least five hours 'on duty' in a notorious and embarassing case for the police department

The employee promptly called police and reported him, according to The Chicago Sun-Times

When Richardson came back to get his ID, real officers were waiting for him.

In 2009, Richardson entered the Grand Crossing District station about 1.30pm dressed as an officer and 'reported for duty'.

He was just 14-years-old.

He identified himself as an officer from another district but was detailed for the day to Grand Crossing and also was savvy enough to sign out a police radio and a ticket book.

Richardson was wearing police-issued pants, shirt, vest, sweater and skull cap

He had also used a newspaper under his shirt to give the impression he was wearing a bulletproof vest, which is standard.

At the age of 14 and after being in a police youth program, Vincent Richardson 'reported for duty' at a Chicago police station and spent several hours doing traffic stops, like this one, until the officer he was partnered with became suspicious

Richardson partnered with another officer for about five hours, going on traffic stops.

The ranking officer became suspicious after noticing Richardson did not have a police star but admitted he did not notice he was underage.

His holster was empty as well.

The year before Richardson had been part of a community program that allows youths to interact with Chicago police officers.

Children who take part in the program are known as a 'police explorer'.

It is unknown however how he managed to get a uniform.

The case was a huge harassment for the police department.

In 2009, Vincent Richardson made international headlines as a 14-year-old after walking into this Grand Crossing District station dressed as an officer. He was assigned to traffic patrol for five hours before his identity was discovered toward the end of the shift

A few months later, Richardson dressed up as a businessman and pretended to take a test drive at a South Side car dealership before driving away with a Lexus.

In 2010, he was sentenced to juvenile prison for pushing his mother and stealing his uncleâ€™s car.

A year later, he was charged as an adult in a gun case.

Richardson received one year in prison for aggravated unlawful use of a weapon, according to court records.

This week, Judge Lauren Gottainer Edidin sentenced him to 18 months in prison and issued a $454 fine.
