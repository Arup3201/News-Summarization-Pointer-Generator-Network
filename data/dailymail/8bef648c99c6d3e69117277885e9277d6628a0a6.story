The books are so old that the only safe way to clean them is with a vacuum cleaner.

So each volume in the 40,000-strong library at Longleat House has to be taken down from the shelves and thoroughly dusted down in a process that can take anything up to 15 minutes per book – and years for the whole collection.

But staff at the Marquess of Bath’s home in Wiltshire aren’t using the family Dyson for this spring clean.

Careful clean: A team of workers with mini-vacuums are cleaning the 40,000 books accumulated over 500 years in the 7 libraries of Longleat House in Wiltshire

They’ve been given small hand vacuums that are delicate enough not to damage the books – some of which date back 500 years.

The entire process takes years to complete and so staff at Longleat House near Warminster, have divided it up into sections.

They started by slowly sucking the dust from the pages of the 4,500 books in the Green Library and have now moved on to the Ante Library, where there are 3,000 books.

Each one takes between three and five minutes to clean depending on age, size, and how delicate it is.

The group is focusing on the shelves nearest to the visitors’ areas because crowds walking past have created more dust.

Arduous task: It takes two teams of four staff 3-15 minutes to delicately hoover the dust from each book using specially adapted low suction vacuum cleaners

The first library at Longleat dates back to the 16th century when the house was built by Sir John Thynne and some of his books still feature in the enormous collection.

The oldest tome at the house dates back to 1470 and there around around 130 others printed before 1500.

Other fascinating books include Shakespeare’s First Folio and the earliest English cookbook, the ‘Book of Cookery’ printed by Pynson in 1500.

Matthew Baalham, assistant librarian said: ‘We concentrate on the books which are closest to where visitors walk as this creates more dust.

Slow progress: Staff started with the 4,500 books in the Green Library and have now moved on to the Ante Library, where there are 3,000 books

‘We use special, low-suction vacuum cleaners and it takes between three and fifteen minutes to clean each book depending on age, size and how delicate it is.

‘Some exceptionally large and dirty books take longer.

‘I’d say the key requirements are concentration, attention to detail, and diligence, as well as knowing how to clean the books in a particular way.

‘The main feature of the vacuum cleaners is that they have sensitive suction levels, if they were any stronger the books could be damaged.

‘They also have the technology to stop any mildew spores that are sucked into the vacuum from getting back out and spread around.’
