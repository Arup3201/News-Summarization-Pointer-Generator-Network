Friends of a holiday rep apparently behind controversial Magaluf Carnage events have revealed he's a 'rich kid who couldn't make friends' as he brags on Facebook about his 'easy' life in 'sl** city'.

Gary Maskell from Bognor Regis even joked about revelations an 18-year-old girl was filmed performing 24 sex acts on men at one of the events last month.

But former school friends of the bar crawl’s assistant manager, who uses the Internet to post pictures of himself with celebrities, has revealed he is a ‘rich kid who couldn’t make friends at school’.

The 21-year-old has uploaded photos of wads of cash boasting: ‘Few days graft ;) #easy’ and his latest tweet: ‘What’s 50 grand to a f****r like me…Please remind me!!’

One former student from Felpham Community College in Bognor Regis, West Sussex, said Maskell was desperate to be popular and used bullying as a way of fitting in.

‘He was always boasting about all the stuff he had at home so obviously hasn't changed,’ they told the Daily Star.

‘People would largely laugh at him. Any decent person would be embarrassed to go around like him.

Maskell brags about his 'easy' earnings, on Instagram stating it was a 'few days graft ;)'

‘I certainly wouldn't be boasting if I hadn't worked for the things I had. Everything he's ever had has been given to him. He's a child.’

But Maskell has defended the claims and told the MailOnline the comments by former school friends are false.

He said: 'I have made all my money myself. I've been abroad since I was 18 and have worked 24/7 to get where I am now.

'I am an extremely hard working person hence why I have money and can flash about.'

He has posted photos on social media sites of himself with celebrities from The Only Way Is Essex and Geordie Shore star’s Marnie Simpson and Jay Gardener – who was at the Carnage event when the shocking sex acts took place.

But Maskell posted on his Twitter account at the time the video of the teenager on a Carnage event was leaked: ‘F*****g howling at the Carnage video going around! Carnage all over and we f*****g love it #teamCarnage #s**gcity.’

Just last week he threatened his Facebook followers that if he caught other ticket touts selling for rival bars: ‘I will not politely tell you to get out, I will drag you down the back of the hotel and smash your face in’.

Maskell also uses his Twitter to brag about his plush Spanish villa complete with a private pool, and driving a new Audi stating: ‘Cruising in the Audi #hardlife’.

His internet posts show him complaining about losing a new iPad after two days, treating himself to a new Emporio Armani watch and enjoying nights out inhaling balloons of nitrous oxide.

He is also seen on his Instagram enjoying himself at the resort with ‘White Dee’, who rose to fame after starring in Channel 4’s Benefits Street, as well as cuddling tigers and trekking with elephants.

However, Maskell faces losing the job funding his current lifestyle after council officials in Magaluf ordered the closure of Playhouse bar, where the shocking video was filmed, and the Carnage company.

It also demanded a fine of £43,500, which must be paid jointly between the two and a 12-month closure.

The pair have 15 days to appeal the decision but council bosses say there is nothing to stop Carnage opening up again under a different name.
