A TV commercial for a burger has been banned because it encouraged unhealthy eating habits in move that could force food giants to radically change marketing tactics.

The decision was made because the burger was given to a child who was seen removing the salad before tucking in.

Parents complained that it is difficult enough already to get youngsters to eat healthy salad and greens without a prime time TV commercial suggesting it is okay to push them to the side of the plate.

Ban: An image from the Morrisons advert which has sparked outrage as the child is seen removing salad

The commercial for the Morrisons supermarket chain was in breach of a rarely used section of an industry code which states advertisers ‘must not disparage good dietary practice’.

Campaigners welcomed the ruling announced today by the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) and called on it take a much tougher stand on the advertising of foods, particularly those loved by children.

The complaints centred on a TV commercial for Britain’s fourth largest supermarket and featured the chain’s 100per cent British beef burgers which were being given to a little girl as a reward.

The ASA said: ‘A TV ad showed a mother preparing a burger for her daughter, who was talking about her day at school.

‘The mother stacked lettuce, tomato and onion on top of the burger and sealed it with the top of the bun. She then passed it to her daughter, who had just said ‘My teacher said I was the best in the whole class’.’

Struggle: Parents have berated the advert claiming it is already difficult trying to get their children to eat healthily without adverts telling them not to

However, it said the girl removed the lettuce, tomato and onion from the bun, putting it on the side of her plate, before smiling broadly as she prepared to take a bite.

A voice over then stated ‘Love quarter-pounders. Love them cheaper’ over an image of burgers being cooked.

Before being screened the commercial was vetted and approved by the industry body Clearcast, which thought the images and message were entirely harmless.

It argued that while the girl did take the salad items out of the bun, she ‘did not look disdainfully at the salad items or make a face that implied she did not like them or would not eat them in the future’.

Clearcast said the salad was not thrown away and the girl made no attempt to hide it. It suggested the girl had simply taken it out to make eating the burger easier and might, possibly, have eaten it later.

However, this failed to convince the watchdog. It argued that the message given was that the daughter was so eager to eat the burger on its own that she immediately removed the salad, so ‘choosing the option with less nutritional value’.

The ASA said: ‘We noted the girl grabbed all the salad in her hand and dropped it on the side in a careless manner, before placing her hands around the bun, ready to eat and smiling, which we considered suggested she was not going to eat the salad later.

‘Because we considered the ad placed an emphasis on the burger being the preferable option to the salad, we concluded it condoned poor nutritional habits or an unhealthy lifestyle, especially in children, and that it disparaged good dietary practice.’

This rule is very rarely used. The last time the ASA acted against an advertiser promoting unhealthy foods was in 2012 and involved the Swizzles Matlow sweet company.

At that time it banned a ‘Cola Capers’ online game for irresponsibly encouraging poor nutritional habits and unhealthy lifestyles in children. The use of popular cartoon character, Scooby Doo, on another section of the website, was also banned.

The Children’s Food Campaign has been putting pressure on the ASA to take a much firmer line on the advertising of foods high in sugar, fat and salt to children.

Campaign co-ordinator, Malcolm Clark welcomed the ruling, saying: ‘It is one of the first occasions we have seen the ASA willing to uphold a complaint for an advert condoning or encouraging poor nutritional habits or an unhealthy lifestyle in children.

Claims: Morrisons insists it has made huge efforts to encourage healthy eating with its own-label food

‘We hope this is the shape of things to come, with the ASA taking a more pro-active approach to protecting children from the mass of high fat, salt, sugar foods marketed at them and encourage healthier eating.

‘However, one swallow – in this case an upheld complaint – does not make a summer. The wording of the advertising codes is vague and inconsistent; the rules for non-broadcast advertising are weaker than for TV and contain many loopholes for companies to exploit; and the complaints process can be hard to navigate and is still too often stacked in favour of the food industry.

‘The ASA, the government, retailers and manufacturers still have a long way to go properly tackle the obesogenic environment that is helping to make our children ill.’

Morrisons insisted it has made huge efforts to encourage healthy eating in children, by, for example, improving the recipes of its own-label food. It said the commercial was simply a fun representation of the problems that parents have in getting youngsters to eat well.

A spokesman said: ‘Trying to convince children to eat their fruit and vegetables is something that most parents will identify with. Our aim with the ad was to reflect this in a humorous and engaging way. We’re disappointed with the ASA’s adjudication.’
