Amanda Knox has revealed she still wants to meet the parents of murdered Meredith Kercher and visit her grave - just days before a fresh trial against her begins.

Knox, 26, spoke out in an interview with Italian glossy weekly Oggi in which she again stressed her innocence and insisted that refusing to show up at the hearing was not a 'admission of guilt'.'

The American was initially convicted of murdering and sexually assaulting Meredith with her then boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito, 29, in 2009.

'Abyss of pain': Amanda Knox said an 'abyss of pain' stands between her and Meredith Kercher's family but she one day wants to visit the grave of her murdered friend with Meredith's parents

Two years later they were sensationally cleared but last Mach Italy's Supreme Court ordered a fresh trial which is due to begin in less than two weeks.

In her interview with Oggi, Knox spoke in front of a camera on the side of a hill overlooking her home town of Seattle, dressed in a blue T shirt, ear rings and wearing little make up she appeared tense as she answered questions under a steel grey sky.

She said: 'Contact the Kerchers? I haven't yet tried. There is this abyss of pain that separates us, that has grown during the trial, I haven't had the courage to cross it. Millions of times I've thought about it and millions of times in my own way I haven't done it because I am scared that they will think it a legal strategy or a media one.

'I don't want them to think of me like that. I read what they said about the trial, about Meredith. I've read John Kercher's (Meredith's father) book. I was absorbed and annihilated by the trial, by prison.

'I still don't have the strength to cry, to digest the loss of Meredith. I would like to meet them, one day I would like to go with them to the grave of my friend.

Hitting back: Raffaele Sollecito, who was accused of murdering Meredith Kercher, says the police's handling of his case was 'incompetent'. He claims he was blackmailed into framing Amanda Knox for the crime

Accused: Sollecito says he refused to comply with what police were suggesting because of his 'fondness' for Knox, pictured, and he wrote a letter from his prison cell to his family insisting he would stand by her

Close: Amanda Knox and Raffaele Sollecito can be seen kissing in Italy shortly after they had been named as suspects in the murder of Miss Kercher

'I don't want to impose myself on their pain, I hope that I can meet them halfway, even if for now it is too early, they still think I am guilty and that is something that hurts me a great deal.'

Meredith was found semi naked and with her throat cut in her bedroom of the house that she shared with Knox and two Italian woman, in Perugia in November 2007.

Knox and her then boyfriend Sollecito were arrested just days later and charged with murdering and sexually assaulting the student from Coulsdon, Surrey,who had only been in Italy for two months when she died.

Tragic: Meredith, 21, was killed in 2007. Sollecito and Knox were both convicted of her murder in 2009 and then cleared

Their first trial ended in 2009 with Knox being given 26 years jail, while Sollecito, got 25 years - however in 2011 an appeal court overturned the verdict after it emerged that forensic police had bungled in gathering the evidence against them and as a result it was considered flawed and unreliable.

In March Italy's Supreme Court rejected that ruling and ordered a fresh trial which will begin in Florence and Knox explained why she would not be going.

'I am trying to rebuild my life. I have only one, I cannot risk exposing it to danger and another injustice. I don't have the money to go back to Italy.

'Not going back is an admission of my innocence, it is not an admission of guilt. There is always the fear of another unjust verdict.

'I still have faith in Italian justice. That's why I am still here fighting. There is no trace of me in that room, in the room where my friend was killed. It is impossosble that I could have taken part in such a situation and not exist in that room, that is the proof of my innocence which has been ignored.

'The proof of innocence is the fact that there is no trace of me in that room, I would ask anyone to answer logically, to prove how you can take part in a murder, an orgy, where I supposedly have the murder weapon in my hand and not leave a trace.

'This is proof of my innocence and it is being ignored but I have faith that if people look at this logically without any prejudice they will see I had nothing to do with this.

'They have robbed me of four years of my life, everything that I could say I said in a hundred court hearings, everything that I possessed, happiness, ingenuity, faith in others, was taken away. I was a little girl when they threw me in jail - now I feel as if I am 40 years older than I am.'

Victim: The pair were found guilty in December 2009 of murdering Meredith Kercher but after an 11-month appeal both convictions were thrown out in October 2011

Knox insisted: 'I did not kill Meredith. I did not kill my friend and I even thought about going to Florence because it drives me mad to think that someone can puff out their chest and point their finger at my empty chair and stain me with a crime that I didn't commit.

'I can understand that you can try and build up an allegation, a conviction, even if there is no damning proof and no motive but they have really exaggerated against me.'

Knox also revealed how she had been to see a psychologist and said: 'I've been twice, my mother insisted on it. I didn't want to go because I had been seen by the psychologists in jail and I can't say they helped much, they just wanted to fill me with anti depressants.

'The first time I went I couldn't say a word. The second time I spoke for 15 minutes solid and at the end I had a panic attack. I couldn't and I still can't, get rid of all the sadness and of the sensation of feeling trapped.

Fear: Sollecito, left, said his former girlfriend Amanda Knox, right, was 'out of contol' after their arrest

'I feel like one of those animals that is hunted by a bigger animal. After I was cleared I thought everything would be OK, that things would have returned to what they were like before, happy, carefree. I tried to convince myself that everything was going well, that it was just a question of time and that the sadness would pass.

'But it didn't pass, the sadness went on, the months slipped past and I was still freaked out, exhausted. Now I have accepted this limbo, even if perhaps I will go back to the psychologist - not even writing my book cured me.'

November,  2007  - Meredith Kercher is found dead in Perugia, ItalyOctober, 2008 - Rudy Guede convicted of sexually assaulting and murdering KercherDecember 2009 
- Amanda Knox and Raffaele Sollecito found guilty of murdering Miss 
Kercher. Miss Knox sentenced to 26 years in prison and Mr Sollecito to 
25. October 2011  -  After an 11-month appeal both convictions were thrown outMarch 2013 - Italy’s highest criminal court ruled that an appeals court must re-hear the case against Miss Knox and Mr Sollecito

She added: 'I can understand the investigators. They were under pressure, they had to find the guilty ones quickly. On my part they got a rapid and wrong idea from my behaviour, my presumed coldness and they decided that I had something to do with the murder, they didn't know exactly what but in some way I was involved, I was guilty and I deserved jail.

'I'm very angry with the prosecutor Giuliano Mignini and the investigators but I will forgive them instantly if they admit their mistake.

'They don't have to say sorry, just that they regret it. I don't want revenge. I would feel such a relief if Mignini admitted he made a mistake. To say that I was innocent would signify that not only had a mistake been made but a mistake had been made on top of another and another to cover up a whole bunch of mistakes.

'The investigators, the judges, don't want to admit this to themselves and to the public...it's all a question of reputation but justice is made up of human beings and human beings can make mistakes.'

Knox also spoke of Sollecito in her interview and confirmed what he had told the magazine last week that she was inexperienced in bed and said: 'Certainly I would have preferred him to protect my privacy. I do all I can to be close to him, we speak all the time, I encourage him, I tell th whole world that he is innocent.

'He knows that we have lived through a nightmare. He knows that I can count on him and he can count on me. How can going back help him? He is suffering more than me in all this - the unjustified conviction, they media and the prosecution it's all being carried out by his country, his people but I have no power. I am simply his friend, a proud friend.'

The Kercher family lawyer has slammed Knox and Sollecito's decision not to attend the fresh trial which is expected to last until November with a verdict due by the end of the year. 

Drifter Rudy Guede, 26, was convicted of murdering and sexual assaulting Meredith in 2008 after a fast track trial and originally sentenced to 30 years, this was later reduced to sixteen and he could be freed on parole by 2016.
