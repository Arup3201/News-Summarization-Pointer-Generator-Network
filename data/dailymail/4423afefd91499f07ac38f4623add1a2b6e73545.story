A player for the Jacksonville Jaguars walked away from a play Sunday afternoon with more than a successful tackle when he managed to get a fistful of his opponent's hair.

During the Jacksonville home game against Arizona, a Cardinals running back was slammed after a short run by defensive end Jason Babin.

And when Babin emerged from the pile, he held a fat fistful of Andre Ellington's dreadlocks.

Hair raising! Jacksonville Jaguars defender Jason Babin came out of a pileup in a Sunday game against the Arizona Cardinals with a fistful of hair

Babin, 33, held the hair aloft for a moment like a trophy.

Then, perhaps realizing that hair doesn't bronze well, defiantly chucked it all to the ground.

The hair-raising tackle has occurred in the past--to such tress-sporting players as Troy Polamalu--but not in recent memory has the player lost the hair.

Ouch: Andre Ellington, a Cardinals running back (pictured here during his years at Clemson) is now short several dreadlocks

Limp victory: After the pride subsided, or perhaps after he realized hair doesn't make a great trophy, Babin tossed the locks to the ground

Now 24-year-old Ellington has little to be do short of waiting for it to grow back.

He wore his hair outside his helmet at his own peril. According to NFL rules, yanking exposed hair is fair play.

The rule, implemented in 2003, says that it is legal to grab a player's hair because it's deemed part of the uniform.

Ellinton may have gotten the last laugh, though. His Arizona Cardinals trounced Babin's Jaguars 27-14.

Cold comfort: Ellington can do little but lick his wounds and wait for his hair to grow back. Since 2003, hair has been deemed 'part of the uniform' and legal to pull in a tackle. His Cardinals beat Babin's Jaguars, however, 24 to 14

While tackling a player by his hair is legal and does occasionally happen, it isn't often ripped completely out
