Cleared: Dennis Meighan pictured today

An Antique firearms collector sensationally revealed yesterday that he was hired to murder the male model who claimed he had an affair with former Liberal Party leader Jeremy Thorpe.

But in an interview with The Mail on Sunday, Dennis Meighan, now 68, said his involvement in the most sensational political scandal in a generation was later covered up.

Until now, it was known only that Meighan supplied the gun used in an alleged attempt on former stable boy Norman Scott’s life.

He says he was offered £13,500 – about £140,000 today – by a representative of Thorpe to kill Scott who, at the time, was ‘telling anyone who would listen’ he was in a relationship with the politician.

After initially agreeing to carry out the murder, Meighan changed his mind. He confessed his role in the affair to police in 1975 but was shocked when they later gave him a prepared statement to sign. ‘It was half as long as my original statement and all the references to Thorpe had been removed,’ says Meighan. ‘It also cleared me completely. It was a cover-up, no question, but it suited me fine.’

It meant Meighan never had to give evidence when Thorpe and three others went on trial at the Old Bailey in 1979, accused of conspiring to murder Scott. All were acquitted and Thorpe, who died last week aged 85, always fiercely denied Scott’s claims of a gay affair. The scandal, however, ended his career.

Meighan received numerous calls from journalists after his name was linked to the case.

‘I turned down all the initial requests but finally I arranged to speak to one reporter who said he would come to see me,’ he said. ‘I put the phone down, walked ten paces across the room and then it rang again.

‘A man with a Welsh accent said, “You can still be nicked, boyo”. The line then went dead.

‘It was clear my phone was bugged. I cancelled the meeting.’

Some weeks earlier Meighan had been contacted by old school friend Andrew Newton, who asked if he could supply him with a gun. ‘He knew I had a collection of antique firearms and knew I could get hold of a working gun.’

They arranged to meet at an Italian restaurant in Shepherd’s Bush, West London, and Newton brought along a man who ‘introduced himself as a representative of Jeremy Thorpe’.

Meighan said: ‘They spoke about Scott, said he was a horrible piece of work, and how he was squealing and being a nuisance and had to be silenced. I didn’t believe it at first but eventually they convinced me. They wanted me to get rid of him and offered me £13,500.

‘That was a lot of money then and I agreed. I don’t know why I said yes and I really don’t know if I’d have gone through with it.’

At the time Meighan was in his late 20s with a reputation in West London as a ‘tough guy’. He said: ‘I got in fights and did a bit of thieving, but nothing heavy. I’d never killed anyone before.’

A few days later he went to the pub where Scott was living near Barnstaple, Devon. ‘I went to have a look more than anything, but the gun was in the car. As soon as I opened my mouth and everyone heard my London accent they turned and looked at me. Scott had been saying London gangsters were after him. I knew then I wouldn’t be able to get away with it so I drove back to London.

‘I told Newton I was pulling out and he panicked because he was going to have to do it himself.’

On October 23, 1975, Newton lured Scott out to Dartmoor by pretending to be a minder hired to protect him from a hitman. After shooting Scott’s dog Rinka, Newton then allegedly tried to shoot Scott, only for the gun to jam.

‘Newton was arrested and I was visited by three policemen, at least that’s what they said they were,’ said Meighan. ‘They knew about me from Newton so I admitted it all in a statement.

‘I thought they’d nick me but they just said they’d be in touch. Then I got a call saying I needed to go to Brentford police station where I would be given an envelope containing a statement. He said if I liked it I should sign it and go. I couldn’t believe it.’
