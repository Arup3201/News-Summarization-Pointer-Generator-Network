An upscale suburban Chicago neighborhood was rocked by an explosion Monday afternoon as one its comfortable family homes was leveled by the blast and subsequent blaze.

Jolie, illinois fire crews raced to the scene of a huge house fire after the ground shook and flames shot into the air around 2pm near New Lenox.

No one was in the home at the time the fire broke out, but the outcome looked bleak from the start that the house might be preserved.

Total destruction: Joliet, Illinois firefighters reached this upscale home in a suburban Chicago neighborhood bordering a golf course too late on Monday

According to WLS-TV, a family of five lived in the home, including three school aged children.

'It was a defensive attack the entire time,' said Joliet Deputy Fire Chief Ray Randich.

Randich told Patch that the flames had already engulfed the home by the time they got the call and raced to the neighborhood, where most homes prices start at $300K.

Photos from the scene show firefighters putting in a valiant effort nonetheless. One neighboring house did sustain some damage, though it was minor.

Blast: The blaze broke out following a huge explosion in the home, according to authorities. The source of the explosion remained unknown Monday afternoon

Leveled: Firefighters fought the blaze, but it was no use. Thankfully, though, no one was at home when the blaze broke out

Family: Five people lived in the comfortable home, three of them school aged children

Investigators arrived as well to start piecing together the events leading to the blast.

'It's up to them to piece this together,' Randich said.

The family who lived in the decimated home are now staying with relatives.

'[They're] very distraught, very distraught,' the homeowner's sister Janice Wenzel. 'They can't believe that this happened, their house is just totaled, it's gone. There's nothing left.

A neighboring home was reportedly slightly damaged at some point during the blast or subsequent blaze
