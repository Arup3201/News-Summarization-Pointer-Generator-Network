Chorus leader: Martin Clews, 66, from Sevenoaks, Kent, broke the silence aboard the 12.07am from London Victoria to Ashford International

The pensioner who led
 fellow night train passengers in a sing-a-long has been identified as a
 strawberry farmer whose spirits had been raised by a few glasses of 
champagne.

Martin Clews, 
66, from Sevenoaks, Kent, broke the silence aboard the 12.07am from 
London Victoria to Ashford International by standing up and starting a 
call-and-response chant.

Despite being met with an awkward hush, he persisted until dozens of his fellow passengers began singing along in chorus.

Mr Clews yesterday admitted he had had ‘a couple of glasses’ of champagne before he launched into his singsong.

'It seemed to me that like-minded bon viveurs in my carriage might enjoy a jolly song on their way home,' he told Mason's News.

'So
 I chose a lively number called Beastie, which has become somewhat of a 
favourite in my rugby club and this went down well with the passengers.

'It emanated many years ago when a mate of mine went out to volunteer helping kids on the west coast of America.

'It’s a spiritual song, I don’t know what the Beastie is, but I suppose it goes back to Africa in a way.'

Mr Clews said the song was popular at his rugby club at Old Whitgiftians in South Croydon and Twickenham.

Footage
 of the impromptu singalong on Friday went viral after it was filmed and
 posted online by George Haswell. But the identity of its beige-suited 
chorus leader had remained a mystery until yesterday.

Audience: The grey-haired man in a beige suit attracted awkward stares when he stood up and launched into a rendition of the standard Side by Side

Audience: Around 50 passengers on the service between London Victoria and Ashford International were treated to the impromptu concert

Attire: After the first song, he then found a hat and began a rendition of Side by Side

Dance: His first song was a collection of random words which he got passengers on the Southeastern Train service to repeat

Mr
 Clews, a father of two, runs Stonepitts Farm in Sevenoaks, Kent, with 
his wife Jacqueline, 66. Their son Dan Clews, 34, is a popular 
singer/songwriter who has performed on stage with comedian Tim Minchin.

Dan's
 music career was the reason Mr Clews had been on the train at all. 'I’d
 been celebrating the release of Dan’s new single, That’s Enough For Me,
 over a glass or two of champagne with friends in London,' he said.

Mr
 Clews left London on the 12.10am train and led the chorus until he got 
off at Kemsing. Beginning with Beastie, he moved on to the old old 
favourite Side By Side until the carriage resembled a scene from a 
musical.

'It probably lasted about half an hour. I was persuaded to take it to another part of the train,' he said.

'After a group got off at Bromley South people from Maidstone asked could I do it again.'

Even
 after he got off, remaining passengers were in such good spirits that 
they continued with a spontaneous rendition of Wonderwall.

Chorus line: At points, the man grabbed people from their seats and got them to join him in the aisle

Movements: Unidentified singer made gestures with his hands to keep the crowd entertained

Put your hands together: Passenger George Haswell, 24, who was heading home to Maidstone after a work night out, filmed the whole episode

Mr Clews' love of music is something he shares with his son, Dan, who appears at Glastonbury this month

Mr
 Haswell, 24, a quantity surveyor said: 'It was so funny and 
entertaining. He was so amazing and put the whole carriage in such a 
good mood.

'After he got
 off there were still around 50 people in great spirits. One person 
started singing Wonderwall and everyone joined in.

'We were singing along for the rest of the journey.'

A
 Southeastern spokeswoman said: 'What a fantastic video! It’s great to 
see our passengers having so much fun during their late night journey 
and really getting into the spirit of the sing-a-long led by their 
fellow passenger.

'We 
applaud him for his enthusiasm and think he deserves a big pat on the 
back for his efforts. Clearly there’s some top singing talent among our 
customers.'

Mr Clews' love of music is something he shares with his son, Dan, who appears at Glastonbury this month.

Mr
 Clews said: 'He’s the real musician and has also been seen performing 
on trains returning to Sevenoaks from playing gigs in what appears to be
 a family tradition.'
