Arsenal and Manchester City will be asked to pay a £20m loan fee for Monaco’s Radamel Falcao but both clubs have baulked at the price and will wait to see if Monaco will do business on Sunday.

The 28-year-old Colombian striker wants to leave Monaco after a year and hopes to join Real Madrid - but the Spanish club have thus far been reluctant to commit anymore of their summer transfer budget.

If Falcao can’t move to Madrid he wants a loan move to keep open the option of moving to the current Champions League holders.

High demand: Monaco have slapped a £20million loan fee on Colombian striker Radamel Falcao

High price:Falcao's wages are around £200,000 a week, meaning the loan package could total £30million

But Liverpool could not convince him to come to Anfield, though City and Arsenal would be more attractive.

The player’s wages are around £200,000 a week meaning the entire package comes to around £30m for a player who could leave after a year, making City and Arsenal extremely reluctant to do business at that price. However, Monaco are determined to re-coup some of the £50m they paid for him last summer.

Arsenal are most obviously in need of a striker, with Olivier Giroud out until Christmas, leaving Alexis Sanchez, who is as much a wide player as a centre forward, as their only experienced central striker.
