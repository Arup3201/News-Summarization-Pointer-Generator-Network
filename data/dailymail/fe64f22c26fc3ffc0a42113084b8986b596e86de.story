Lewis Hamilton’s relationship with Nico Rosberg appeared to hit rock bottom on Sunday after the British driver denied being friends with his team-mate.

A seething Hamilton was speaking after Rosberg regained the lead of the World Championship following his lights-to-flag victory in Sunday’s Monaco Grand Prix.

Hamilton and Rosberg have both insisted their friendship, which goes back to their childhood as team-mates in karting, would survive the fierce test of a championship battle.

Agonising: It was a long day for Hamilton, who was still upset over what happened in qualifying

But speaking after today’s race, 
Hamilton, who fought off a late challenge from Daniel Ricciardo to 
finish second and thus securing a fifth consecutive one-two finish for 
Mercedes, said: ‘We are not friends. We are colleagues.’

Hamilton was furious after Rosberg’s mistake during qualifying forced him to abandon his final attempt to snatch pole from his team-mate.

Before the race, Mercedes chief Niki Lauda admitted Hamilton was unhappy in the team's morning briefing, and the Briton's mood rapidly deteriorated on Sunday after he felt he should have pitted one lap earlier than Rosberg before battling the closing stages of the race with dirt in his eye.

‘I had great pace and felt very strong
 but it's a very difficult place to overtake,’ Hamilton, who appeared to
 avoid Rosberg in a tense podium ceremony, added.

Hamilton also revealed that he and Rosberg had not even been in the post-qualifying debriefing together on Saturday.

'Nico
 did his big debrief before I got there, which is not what we normally 
do,' Hamilton said.

'Fortunately the engineers wrote down what Nico 
said.'

Hamilton's dour mood 
was in stark contrast to that of Rosberg who ended his team-mate's 
four-race winning streak by securing his second victory in Monaco in as 
many years.

'We've always 
been friends, we always will be friends,' Rosberg said. 'But friends is
 a big word. What exactly is friends? We have a good relationship and 
work well together.'

Hamilton
 added: 'It's a fierce battle between me and Nico and will continue that
 way. I'm going to keep my head up and keep pushing.'
