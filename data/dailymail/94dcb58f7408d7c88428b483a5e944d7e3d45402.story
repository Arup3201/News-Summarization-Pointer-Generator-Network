A five-year-old boy was thrown out of a moving SUV after his mother and her boyfriend tried to make a quick getaway from a robbery.

Lisa Degerolamo and Daniel McLaughlin, both 29, were driving away from a Walmart in Teaticket, Massachusetts, when the child rolled out of the back seat through a door that was left open so the $700 television they had just stolen could fit inside.

Shocked employees and bystanders watched as the youngster lay helpless in the parking lot as Degerolamo turned around and drove back.

She picked up the boy and managed to flee the scene before cops arrived. 

The horrifying incident sparked a manhunt for the pair with police releasing a picture of Degerolamo fleeing in her car with the door ajar.

They were arrested later the same day at their home in West Yarmouth following a tip from police. 

The boy was said to be 'uninjured and in good spirits'. 

A statement sent to the Boston Herald said: 'As the vehicle was fleeing the scene, a small child was ejected from the vehicle due to an unsecured door that was left ajar due to the size of the television. 

'Bystanders attempted to intervene; however the suspect returned and collected the child then fled the area.'

Degerolamo was charged last night with reckless endangerment of a child, larceny over $250, operating a motor vehicle with a suspended license and negligent operation of a motor vehicle.

She also faces accusations the boy was not in a child seat at the time,  

McLaughlin was arrested for reckless endangerment of a child and negligent operation of a motor vehicle.

Dangerous: The pair left one of the doors of the car open so the $700 television they had stolen from the store (pictured) could fit inside. The pair were arrested the same day at their home
