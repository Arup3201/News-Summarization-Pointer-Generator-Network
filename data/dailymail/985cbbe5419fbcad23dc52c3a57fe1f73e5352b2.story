This is the dramatic moment police drew a Taser as they battled to gain control of the frenzied crowd surrounding the scene of a fatal stabbing on London's Oxford Street yesterday.

As hundreds of shoppers look on in horror at paramedics trying to revive the teenager outside a branch of Foot Looker, several distressed onlookers appeared to try to push past the line of police.

And as emotions ran high, officers had to physically restrain a number of youths, including one teen who appeared desperate to push through towards the victim following the Boxing Day attack.

With throngs of Boxing Day bargain hunters staring in shock, one officer is clearly seen drawing his Taser from its holster and pointing it in the direction of the youth.

On the video soundtrack, what sounds like the distinctive rattle of the electronic gun can be heard over the shouts of shoppers and police, as the youth gesticulates wildly with officers.

The black youth who the Taser was aimed at did not appear to be physically harmed by the gun, and he was eventually forced back into the crowd.

A Scotland Yard spokesman initially confirmed that an officer had discharged a Taser.

But tonight the Metropolitan Police denied that the weapon was fired in anger.

Responding to the YouTube footage, Commander Steve Rodhouse said: 'One of the first units to come across the incident were officers from the Met's Diplomatic Protection Group who were driving past.

'On arrival they were confronted by certain elements of the crowd who were extremely agitated and officers had to protect the victim and those administering emergency first aid to him.

'Officers can be seen in the footage pushing the crowd back and one officer is shown to remove his Taser from its holster, although at no time was it ever deployed.

'Clearly in those initial early stages, officers would have been unaware of what had occurred and where the suspects might be and their priority would have been to prevent further injury or loss of life to those in the area.'

After police shut off the first crime scene, Boxing Day bargain hunters and tourists were going up to the cordon to take pictures and ask officers what had happened.

Shoppers could be seen going in and out of nearby shops, such as Debenhams and Zara, but a number of stores were forced to close.

Other officers keeping order at the crime scene have to shove other youths back away from the victim, who lies lifeless on the floor as paramedics try in vain to save his life.

Met Police officers can be heard several times on the footage yelling at the assembled crowd to 'Get back' and 'Move away' as the horror unfolds in front of central London's Bond Street tube station.

It is thought the 18-year-old may have been stabbed in a row over a pair of trainers.

Witnesses said the teenager was 
amongst a group of black youths, thought to be rival gangs, fighting 
over the trainers at the Foot Locker branch on Oxford Street.

Hours
after the murder, police rushed to a second incident near Oxford Circus
Tube station – 700 yards from Foot Locker – where a young man had been 
stabbed in the leg.

At the scene were a bloodied pair of jeans and a 
pair of Nike trainers.

Last
year, police fired Tasers over 1,500 times, an average force increase 
of 130 per cent and 70 per cent up on the previous year.

The
electronic weapons, which are only used by trained firearms officers, 
send out a 50,000 volt shock from either two darts or by placing the 
stun gun directly on the body.

In
the year ending March 2011, some police forces used Tasers 800 per cent
more than in the previous year, according to the Channel 4 News 
investigation.

Earlier this year the Met Police said it was considering increasing the number of Tasers it issues to officers.

Met
Police commissioner Bernard Hogan-Howe said the force was considering 
having one of the controversial firearms in every police car, so they 
can be deployed more quickly.

Mr Hogan-Howe had commented last week that fewer people are being Tasered by police.

But Amnesty International questioned his comments in light of the figures.

Critics say the electronic stun gun can be fatal and changes the nature of policing.

Police were investigating whether there was any link between the two stabbings.

Detective
Chief Inspector Mark Dunne, who is leading the murder inquiry, said 
yesterday: ‘This is probably the busiest place in the United Kingdom 
right now on the busiest shopping day.’

The crimes brought a large area thronged by tens of thousands of shoppers to a standstill and closed many stores.

Scotland Yard said Oxford Street has 
today fully reopened to pedestrians, buses and other traffic, while a 
small crime scene remains in place outside the Foot Locker store.

Police
commanders had to bring in extra officers to hold back crowds of 
bargain hunters incensed their spending spree had been interrupted.

Yesterday’s murder happened at about 1.45pm – the height of the shopping frenzy.

The
sprawling Foot Locker store, near Bond Street Tube station, was packed 
with shoppers frantically sifting through piles of sales goods.

Witnesses said a group of young men began arguing over a box of trainers before the victim was stabbed in the chest.

It is believed the group may have been on Oxford Street on a shoplifting spree and were arguing over who stole what.

One said the killer said ‘Wallah’, an Arabic slang term for ‘I swear to God’, before plunging the knife into his victim.

The stabbed youth pushed his way through the crowd of shoppers, many of whom did not realise what had happened, before collapsing on the pavement outside.
