A con-artist psychic who scammed her clients out of millions of dollars was jailed for ten years on Monday.

Rosa Marks, 62, was sentenced at a court in Fort Lauderdale, Florida after bilking $17.8million from customers in Florida and New York City. Prosecutors had sought 22 years.

Among
 Marks' victims was multimillionaire romance novelist Jude Deveraux who 
testified at the trial in September after being defrauded out of 
$12million over two decades.

Ms
 Deveraux first sought the help of Marks in the 1990s following the 
death of her eight-year-old son in a motorcycle accident and in the 
midst of a painful divorce.

Marks told the author that she could connect her with her dead son via a 'soul-swapping' treatment and led Ms Deveraux to believe that Brad Pitt was in love with her.

Marks also stole clients' jewellery saying to had to rid it of curses while telling others she could protect them from the IRS.

During sentencing on Monday, the judge told the Palm Beach Post: 'These people for whatever reason wanted to believe these crazy stories.

'I'm certainly not a psychologist and I can't figure out how any rational human being would believe any of the representations made by Mrs. Marks.'

Marks, who called her victims 'dear friends' said that she didn't realize that she had done anything wrong.

Ms Deveraux told the court last year that at the time she met Marks, whom she knew as Joyce Michaels, she was suicidal and trying to get out of a 'horrible, terrible' marriage, according to the Sun-Sentinel.

Ms Deveraux told the court that she did not believe in psychic powers but was really looking for someone to listen to her problems.

She met Marks for the first time in a studio in midtown Manhattan where the psychic claimed to work from a 'special room' in St Patrick's Cathedral on 5th Avenue.

After several meetings, Marks told the writer that she would help her achieve a 'peaceful divorce' - for a fee of $1,200. 

Although the author did not believe in Marks' psychic powers, she came to trust her after several of her prophecies appeared to come true. 

Marks managed to accurately predict that Ms Deveraux's husband would file for divorce - down to the hour that he would do so. The clairvoyant also told the author to leave her apartment for a few days and change her locks because her estranged husband would show up.

Ms Deveraux told the Florida court that this turned out to be the case and 'staff at her apartment building told her that her husband unexpectedly showed up and was angrier than anyone they'd ever seen'.

Marks later asked the author to hand over $1million which she would need to carry out her meditations - but that it would be returned to her.

The psychic told Ms Deveraux that the money would be kept in drawers in the cathedral room of St Patrick's. 

The author was told that 'money was evil' by the psychic and would attract evil if kept in her bank account.

Most of the money that Marks was found guilty of stealing is believed to have come from Ms Deveraux who amassed the vast fortune by selling 60 millions copies of her romance tales, which have titles such as Moonlight In The Morning, The Scent Of Jasmine and Scarlet Nights.

Police swooped on Marks and a gang of psychics, all related by blood or marriage, in August 2011 after a huge cross-state investigation dubbed 'Operation Crystal Ball'.

More than 400 rings, 100 watches and 200 necklaces – many of them from Cartier, Tiffany & Co and Gucci – were seized.

They all billed themselves as fortune tellers, clairvoyants and spiritual advisers and operated from shops in Fort Lauderdale.

The authorities said that many customers came to them as a desperate last resort, for instance hoping that they could be cured of a disease or put in touch with a deceased loved one.

Customers were promised that their money would be returned once it was cleansed of evil spirits, but according to the indictment it was kept for personal used by the fortune tellers.

Victims included a woman with a brain tumour who was told she would receive 'positive energy'. She was reportedly left  unemployed and in danger of losing her apartment.

A person in Japan handed over $496,000 to the psychic readers and a man from Denmark sent about $186,000.
