A third option: Alex Salmond said Devolution Max did not offer all the advantages of independence

Scotland could be given the option to secure greater powers over their own government while remaining in the UK, according to SNP leader Alex Salmond.

During a party conference, Mr Salmond introduced the notion of 'Devolution Max' as a possible third option for Scots who will decide whether to stay as part of the UK.

The politician also warned Westminister to stay out of the issue and pledged that only Scottish voters had the right to vote on the issue.

In a unprecedented concession Mr 
Salmond acknowledged Devolution Max as attractive as it would leave 
Scotland with powers over its government and economy while remaining in 
the UK.

According to the Independent newspaper he described the move as 'all good, 
all necessary, but not good enough' – as it would leave Trident missiles
on the river Clyde, and exclude Scotland from 'the councils of Europe 
and the world'.

He said only complete independence would resolve these issues, 'which is why this party will campaign four-square for [it] in the
coming referendum.'

The first minister also told the conference held in Inverness that he would fight claims that Westminster was planning to take control of referendum preparations.

According to the newspaper he quoted the Irish nationalist Charles Stewart Parnell saying: 'No politician, certainly no London politician, will determine the future of the Scottish nation.

'The Prime Minister should hear this 
loud and clear: the people of Scotland are now in the driving seat. The 
days of Westminster politicians telling Scotland what to do and what to 
think are over.'

An independence referendum will be held at the end of the current five-year parliament.

Mr Salmond also accused coalition ministers in Westminster of trying to prevent Scottish independence, and slashing £16billion from the Scottish budget to reduce the deficit while benefiting from North Sea oil.

He told the conference that London had already gained £300m from Scottish waters and vowed that independence would reclaim profits for Scotland.
