Nearly 10 per cent of the criminals kept in open prisoners are murderers, the Government has admitted.

The revelation comes amid heightened fears over the security at open prisons after the armed bank robber known as the 'Skull Cracker' walked out of one while on day release.

Michael Wheatley went on the run for four days after absconding earlier this month. He was eventually recaptured and charged with robbing a building society at gun point.

Wheatley, who earned his Skullcracker nickname for 'pistol whipping' bank staff with imitation guns, was allowed to stay in open prison despite being given 13 life sentences in 2002 for bank raids and having a history of prison escapes.

Now it has emerged that Wheatley is far from the only dangerous criminal kept in open prison.

In a Parliamentary Written Answer the Coalition said more than 350 murderers and 70 people serving sentences for manslaughter are in open prisons, which have minimal supervision.

In December 2013, figures showed that 363 murderers were housed in such institutions, almost 10 per cent of the 4,092 inmates in open prisons across England and Wales.

Other prisoners include those convicted of attempted murder, wounding, assault and attacks in children.

Wheatley, who was eligible for release after eight years, went on the run for four days earlier this month after leaving Standford Hill open prison on day release and failing to return.

He was arrested, together with another man, in Tower Hamlets, east London, after allegedly robbing a branch of the Chelsea Building Society in Sunbury-on-Thames, Surrey.

The notorious armed robber had a history of absconding since being jailed in 1984 for nine years following a series of shop raids.

In 1988 he escaped while on a hospital visit and went on to commit nine break-ins. In 1989 he was jailed for 16 years for break-ins and robberies, reduced to 11 years on appeal.

Three years later, while on a day release to an optician, he went on the run again and went on to commit several armed robberies.

And in 1993 he was jailed for a further seven years and in 2002 given the 13 life sentences, with a minimum term of eight years.

Last summer he was transferred to open conditions, but was returned to a proper prison in December after concerns were raised about his behaviour.

In February his probation officer approved his return to an open prison before he disappeared on May 3.

Philip Davies, the Conservative MP for Shipley, West Yorks, said people would be 'shocked' that murderers were serving sentences in prisons where 'they are basically free to … walk out of the gates'.

He said: 'Most people thought that the people who were in open prisons were no real threat to anyone, who would not go up to anyone and do anyone any physical harm.

'The prison authorities try and create the impression that these cases are one-offs when you need a one-off inquiry, but this is not a one-off situation, it is general practice. I don’t believe that all of those 363 murderers are safe, fully rehabilitated, no danger to the public.'

Jeremy Wright, the prisons minister, said all inmates housed in such conditions were 'suitably risk-assessed' before they were released into the community under 'appropriate licence conditions'.

Harry Fletcher, an adviser to the probation union Napo, insisted that 'open jails are needed to help rehabilitation'.

He said: 'However, prisoners should only be allocated following a full risk assessment. In this case staff seem to have been worried about further offending and absconding.

'There is a history of running away while on day release. The issue is a failure of government to provide enough secure places and pressure on staff to move prisoners through the system.'
