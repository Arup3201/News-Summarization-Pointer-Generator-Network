Setting the stage for imminent military intervention in Syria, Secretary of State John Kerry said Friday that the U.S. has 'high confidence' that Syrian President Bashar Assad carried out a chemical weapons attack against citizens.

Calling Assad a 'thug' and a 'murderer,' he declared, 'History would judge us all extraordinarily harshly if we turned a blind 
eye to a dictator’s use of chemical weapons.'

'The primary question is really no longer, what do we know,' he said. 'The question is... what are we in the world going to about it?'

Kerry said the credibility and security of the U.S. and its allies are at stake.

'Some cite the risk of doing things,' he said. But we need to ask, “What is the risk of doing nothing?”'

In
 a veiled reference to the British Parliament's vote Thursday to opt out
 of military intervention in Syria, Kerry said the U.S. is not afraid to
 act alone.

President Obama said Friday tha the is considering 'limited, narrow' military action against Syria

'President Obama
 will ensure that the United States of America makes our 
own decisions on our own timelines, based on our values and our 
interests,' he said. 'Now, we know that after a decade of conflict, the 
American people are tired of war. Believe me, I am, too. But fatigue 
does not absolve us of our responsibility.'

He said the U.S. should also feel confident that it has the backing of a number of other nations, including Turkey, Australia, the Arab League and what he called America's 'oldest ally,' France.

Shortly after Kerry's remarks, President Obama said he is considering a 'limited, narrow act' against Syria.

'We're not considering any open-ended commitment,' he told reporters in brief remarks at the White House. 'We're not considering any boots-on-the-ground approach.'

Half of Americans say they oppose taking 
military action against Syria and nearly 80 percent believe Obama should
 seek congressional approval before using any force, according to a new 
NBC poll.

The administration supplemented 
Kerry's remarks Friday with the release of an intelligence report that 
concludes 1,429 people were killed in the attack, including 426 
children.

'It’s findings are as clear as they are compelling,' Kerry said of the findings.

The
 report concludes with 'high confidence,' short of actual confirmation, 
that the Syrian government carried out the chemical weapons attack.

'Our high confidence assessment is the 
strongest position that the U.S. Intelligence Community can take short 
of confirmation,' the report says.

'We intercepted communications involving a senior official intimately familiar with the offensive who confirmed that chemical weapons were used by the regime on August 21 and was concerned with the U.N. inspectors obtaining evidence,' the report continues. 'On the afternoon of August 21, we have intelligence that Syrian chemical weapons personnel were directed to cease operations.'

The findings also claim that Assad is the 'ultimate decision maker' for Syria's chemical weapons program and that his regime has used the weapons on a smaller scale against citizens several times in the past year.

'This assessment is based on multiple streams of information including reporting of Syrian officials planning and executing chemical weapons attacks and laboratory analysis of physiological samples obtained from a number of individuals, which revealed exposure to sarin,' the report says. 'We assess that the opposition has not used chemical weapons.' Sarin is a type of nerve gas.

The report further reveals evidence that the regime had been preparing chemical weapons in the three days prior to the attacks and protected themselves using gas masks.

'Syrian chemical weapons personnel were operating in the Damascus suburb of 'Adra from Sunday, August 18 until early in the morning on Wednesday, August 21, near an area that the regime uses to mix chemical weapons, including sarin,' the report says.

The report also cited evidence that the attacks were launched from regime-controlled areas into opposition territory or contested areas.

Several senior officials related before the release of the report that the intelligence was 'not a slam dunk' in terms of tying Assad's regime to the use of chemical weapons.

The
 term 'slam dunk' is a reference to the then-CIA Director George Tenet's
 assurance in 2002 that assessments showing that Iraq had weapons of 
mass destruction was a 'slam dunk.'

Calling Assad a 'thug' and a 'murderer,' John Kerry declared, 'History would judge us all extraordinarily harshly if we turned a blind eye to a dictator's use of chemical weapons.'

Kerry assured on Friday that the U.S. will not repeat the mistakes of the Iraq war.

'We are more than mindful of the Iraq experience,' Kerry said. 'We will not repeat that moment.'

He later added: 'Whatever decision [Obama] makes in Syria it will bear no resemblance to Afghanistan, Iraq or even Libya. It will not involve any boots on the ground. It will not be open ended. And it will not assume responsibility for a civil war that is already well underway.'

The administration briefed members of Congress on a conference call Thursday evening to explain its conclusion that Bashar Assad's government was guilty of carrying out a suspected chemical attack on August 21.

Following the call, House Democratic 
leader, Rep. Nancy Pelosi of California, sided with Republican Speaker 
John Boehner of Ohio in urging the administration to engage with the 
full Congress on the matter.

She also said that the administration must provide 'additional transparency into the decision-making process.'
