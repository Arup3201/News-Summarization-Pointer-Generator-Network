A four-year-old girl is turning into a ‘human mannequin’ after being diagnosed with rare disorder that stiffens her joints.

Tillie Mae Mawdsley is one of just a handful of youngsters in the world suffering from the rare degenerative disorder Sanfilippo.

It is caused by a missing enzyme, creating a build up of sugar around the muscles, stiffening the joints.

Tillie Mae Mawdsley has the rare  degenerative disorder Sanfilippo syndrome. Caused by a build-up 
of sugar around the muscles, the the condition causes severe muscle stiffness that could leave her totally immobile

Within months, the condition will leave her totally immobile unless someone else moves her arms and legs into position. The condition has now rendered her unable to talk. 

Tillie is expected to die from the cruel illness before she is 14 unless she gets access to a new miracle drug - currently not available through the NHS.

Her parents Michala, 32, and Paul, 36, say medication called Genistein could halt the youngster’s deterioration - but they have no way of getting it in Britain.

Incredibly, the couple are bidding to pay for the £580,000 Department of Health clinical drug trials which could make it available to Tillie Mae themselves.

Mrs Mawdsley, a part-time customer services assistant, has vowed to do everything to help stop her daughter’s deterioration.

She said: 'It is almost worse that Tillie did speak as now I feel like I am losing more of her every day. She is very bright and gets frustrated when she cannot articulate how she feels or what she wants.

'Some days you totally give up and then others she seems to be better. The doctors said she will not know she is ill, which is a comfort.

'She has started to become stiff, her left foot bends in and she cannot lift her arms above her head.

'We try to stretch Tillie’s limbs, but we cannot push her as she does not have a proper understanding of pain and does not cry when she is in pain.

'She will become like a mannequin - so stiff she can only move with our help. The thought of Tillie not being around is unbearable. We just cannot think about it right now. We just have fun everyday and try to be happy.We are so desperate to get this money. The drug would mean the world to us.

'I do not care what happens as long as we have Tillie here with us.'

Tillie, who lives with her mother, construction site manager father Paul and her older sister Lexie, six, in Hatfield, Hertfordshire, was diagnosed with Sanfilippo syndrome when she was two.

Mrs Mawdsley added: 'People always said Tillie looked different to Lexi, but we just said Tillie looks like daddy and Lexi looks like mummy. Now we know Tillie has the coarse facial features of Sanfilippo.'

The little girl had spent 10 months of the year on antibiotics for a cold before she was transferred to a specialist who spotted the syndrome.

Tillie's mother Michala (left) has to move the little girl's arms and legs into position. The condition has also robbed the little girl of her ability to speak

She is now entering the second stage of the condition, which includes loss of speech, mobility and balance as the build up of chemicals attacks the brain and makes the muscles stiff. Children with the condition also cry for no reason and get frustrated and can go on to develop Autism.

In the final stage of the fatal condition children have to be tube fed and are prone to colds and infections, which often kill them.

The drug Genistien, which is found in soy foods, is non-toxic, can be taken by mouth and is relatively cheap, could delay the progression of the disease.

Developed at Manchester Children’s Hospital, it has already been used to good effect in the U.S.

But because the condition only effects a handfull of children in Britain each year funding for clinical trials to appraise the drugs viability for NHS use has not been provided.

A group of families are now trying to raise £580,000 to fund the clinical trial at Manchester Children’s Hospital with the help of new charity Wicked Genes.

The Society for Mucopolysaccharide Diseases has already raised £200,000 for the trial and funded early studies to test the drug on mice.

Tillie's parents say medication called Genistein could halt the youngster¿s deterioration - but they have no way of getting it in Britain

The proposed trial at the University 
of Manchester will determine the correct and safe dose to be prescribed 
to children with the condition.

Christine
 Lavery, chief executive of the society for mucopolysaccharide diseases,
 said the research would only take around four weeks once the funding is
 in place.

She said: “There
 is not much money from government to fund research and the Medical 
Research Council and Welcome Trust did not want to fund the Genistein 
trial.

'It is down to private trusts or people who have an interest to fund it. These children are rare and we need rare money. We have to do the research now or a whole generation of children will miss out.'

A
 Department of Health spokesperson said: 'Government funding is 
available for research into rare diseases including clinical trials.

Researchers are encouraged to apply for funding through the National Institute for Health Research.'Applications are judged in open competition and awards are made on the basis of the scientific quality of the proposal.'To donate to Tillie go to www.shareagift.com/giftpagefortillie1 or wickedgenes.co.uk

Sanfilippo syndrome is metabolism disorder passed down through families. 

It is caused by a missing enzyme, creating a build up of sugar around the muscles stiffening the joints.

Symptoms appear after the first year of life and may include a decline in learning ability between ages of two and six. Normal growth may be followed by a child being a below average height.  Other symptoms include:Stiff joints that may not extend fully; walking problems; behavioral problems; coarse facial features; diarrhoea; full lips; sleep difficulties; heavy eyebrows that meet in the middle of the face above the nose.Most children with Sanfilippo syndrome live into their teenage years. Once the condition progresses, children suffer loss of speech, mobility and balance as the build up of chemicals attacks the brain and makes the muscles stiff.

Children with the condition also cry for no reason and get frustrated and can go on to develop Autism.In the final stage of the fatal condition children have to be tube fed and are prone to colds and infections, which often kill them.
