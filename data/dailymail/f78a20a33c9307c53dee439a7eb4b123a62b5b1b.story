He has hopes of running the country in just 15 months.

But Ed Miliband has been left off a list of Britain the 100 best-connected men in Britain.

To add insult to injury, his brother David and spin doctor Tom Baldwin have both been included on the power list drawn up by GQ magazine.

Labour leader Ed Miliband has not been included on the GQ list of Britain's 100 best-connected men

Ed Miliband's brother David, who lives in New York, has been included on the list along with Labour's chief adviser Tom Baldwin

Space has even been found for Labour’s education spokesman, Tristram Hunt, the TV historian who was only elected to the Commons in 2010.

The list aims to identify men exercising influence by their networking not only in politics, but the media, business, sports, PR and culture.

The top 100 are not ranked in order of importance, but politicians who make the cut include Prime Minister David Cameron and London mayor Boris Johnson.

In a thinly-veiled swipe at Ed Miliband, GQ editor Dylan Jones insisted ‘connection is the new influence’.

His brother David, who he beat in the race to be Labour leader, does not even live in the UK. The former foreign secretary - currently living in the US as president of aid charity International Rescue - is listed for ‘reinventing himself as a world-stage player’ by ‘schmoozing’ with media moguls and bankers, while his brother ‘struggles to reinvent Labour in time for the next election’.

Mr Baldwin, Mr Miliband’s senior advisor on Communications and Strategy, is a former Times journalist who is described by GQ as ‘a cross between Alastair Campbell, Hunter S Thompson and Rasputin’ and ‘a general go-to fixer for every problem facing the leader of the opposition’.

David Cameron, Prince Charles and Boris Johnson all made the grade for the list

Big names from the media include News Corp executive chairman Rupert Murdoch, BBC director general Lord Hall and CNN presenter Piers Morgan - a former GQ interviewer - while sport is represented by the likes of David Beckham and Andy Murray, art by potter Grayson Perry, TV host Stephen Fry and actors Idris Elba and Benedict Cumberbatch, and PR by Matthew Freud, described as ‘probably the best-connected man in Britain’.

The magazine identifies each of the men on the list as a ‘connector’, ‘influencer’, ‘socialite’, ‘leader’ or ‘spider’ - the latter denoting people who ‘operate in more than one sector’.

Mr Cameron, classed as a leader and a socialite, merits his place for ‘forging against all the odds a coalition government’ with Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg - who does not make the list - but ‘now has to get his own house in order and make the public case for a Conservative victory’ at the next election, said the magazine.

Meanwhile, the Prince of Wales is hailed as a leader, influencer and connector who is acting as ‘a modest, but hugely influential deputy head of state, as the Queen, 87, begins to scale down her responsibilities’.

Mr Jones, who once wrote a biography of Mr Cameron and last week collected an OBE, said: ‘The era of traditional, top-down power is over; connection is the new influence and today's achievers operate via a free-flowing exchange of ideas, using social media and personal networks to create value and understanding.

‘In recognition of this we decided to partner with Editorial Intelligence, the knowledge networking business, to co-curate a list bringing together those who embody the power of ideas today in a circle of connections rather than a top-down Who's Who.

‘Surely this is the first list to include both Charles Windsor and Peter Tatchell side by side, as well as Ed Miliband's brother David and spin doctor Tom Baldwin, but not the Labour leader himself.’
