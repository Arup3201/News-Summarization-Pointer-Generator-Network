Police in Scotland are trialling mobile fingerprint scanners to help officers identify people on the streets more quickly.

The scanners, being used for the first time in the country by officers in Aberdeen, are linked to a national database of fingerprints and police can be alerted in seconds if a suspect's prints match a record.

Senior officers believe that the devices will save 'several hours' of police time by cutting out escorted journeys to stations to check identities.

The devices have already been trialled in England, with several forces branding them a success, and they are currently used by more than 25 forces including the Metropolitan Police which launched them in January.

West Midlands Police were able to identify about 2,200 people, including some who were wanted in connection with criminal investigations, during an initial six-month trial.

If they prove a success in Aberdeen, they could be used across Scotland.

Chief inspector Nick Topping said: 'It can be a considerable impact on our time to have to convey people to a police station in order to confirm their identification where there may be dubiety.

'The mobile scanners can quickly confirm this and, ultimately, free up officers to be on the streets protecting the public.

'It will also ensure that members of the public who we need to speak to in relation to our enquiries are not unnecessarily delayed in going about their own business.

'The scanners will also provide opportunities for police to detect the small minority who may attempt to pervert the course of justice by providing false details.

'There are numerous examples where these devices have been used very effectively in ensuring officers have been able to quickly conclude their enquiries and be available to provide further service within the local communities.'

As well as being used to identify people stopped on the street, the technology is being used in England to identify unconscious or fatal victims of road traffic collisions and to identify murder victims.

The scanners are barely bigger than the size of the average mobile phone and check prints against the Police National Computer.
