Keith Olbermann has been suspended from presenting his television sports show on ESPN for a week over comments he made to students on Twitter when they contacted him about their cancer fundraiser.

Olbermann, who is well known for his forthright posts on Twitter and critical view of Penn State, was contacted by a student at the university about their annual pediatric cancer fundraiser, but responded with just one word 'Pitiful.'

In an exchange of furious tweets with students who had been involved in the $13million fundraising effort, Olbermann repeatedly refused to back down and posted a number of critical comments about the school's reputation and branded students stupid. 

Keith Olbermann has been suspended from presenting his show on ESPN for a week after he got into a Twitter spat with students about a cancer fundraiser for children they had done, as he criticised the university 

He later apologised that his comments had come in response to the pediatric cancer fundraiser and was suspended by ESPN. Olbermann had insisted his comments were about the university in general and not the campaign. 

In a statement the sports channel said: 'We are aware of the exchange Keith Olbermann had on Twitter last night regarding Penn State. 

'It was completely inappropriate and does not reflect the views of ESPN.

'We have discussed it with Keith, who recognizes he was wrong. ESPN and Keith have agreed that he will not host his show for the remainder of this week and will return on Monday.' 

The spat began when a student posted a message on Twitter to Olbermann with the phrase 'We Are!' on Monday evening and a link to a story about the fundraising campaign, which takes place every year at the University. 

Olbermann replied with 'Pitiful', and his response inflamed students and alumni who saw the exchange. 

The twitter exchange began when a student at Penn State sent Keith Olbermann a link to a story about their $13million fundraising campaign to help children with cancer, and he replied with one word: 'Pitiful' 

The initial message referred to an annual fundraising campaign called Thon, run by Penn State. It is a three day dance marathon which has been raising money for the Four Diamonds Fund at Penn State Hershey Children's Hospital since 1977. 

Olbermann was highly critical of the university in numerous exchanges, saying his comment was aimed at defining Penn State itself and was referring to students who go there in general.

The host has previously been critical of the institution after its assistant football coach was convicted of sex abuse.  

In one post he said: 'I'd like to thank the students and alums of Penn State for proving my point about the mediocrity of their education and ethics.' 

 A number of people saw Olbermann's tweet and criticised the presenter for his comments about Penn State

At the end of the exchange Olbermann posted further comments outlining his dislike for the university 

And in another message, when a student asked if he had an opinion about the millions of dollars they had managed to raise, Olbermann replied that it still did not change the school's reputation. 

But later on Tuesday evening Olbermann apologised on Twitter. He said: 'I was stupid and childish and way less mature than the students there who did such a great fundraising job.'

Olbermann had previously worked as a news commentator for MSNBC, and was known for his reporting of the Bill Clinton and Monica Lewinsky scandal. He gained infamy when he interviewed Hilary Clinton at the same time he was working on reporting the affair, and later apologised for his actions. 

He was fired from MSNBC in 2011 for donating money congressional Democrats who had been guests on his show.

Olbermann repeatedly refused to back down over the comments he posted about Penn State university 

Olbermann returned to ESPN in 2013 after a 13 year absence, but was forbidden from talking about politics on the show.  

The ESPN host has taken a swipe at Penn State before, placing it in a list of the 'World's Worst in Sports' during an episode of Olbermann in January, Sports Illustrated reported. 

This followed a decision by by NCAA to restore former Nittany Lions coach Joe Paterno's victories, which had previously been vacated as part of the school's sanctions after the Jerry Sandusky scandal. At the time the school was forced to vacate all its victories from 1998 to 2011 after Sandusky, a longtime Penn State assistant football coach was convicted on 45 counts of sex abuse.​
