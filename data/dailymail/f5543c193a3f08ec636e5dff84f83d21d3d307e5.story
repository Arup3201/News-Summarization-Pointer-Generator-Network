The world’s largest gingerbread house has been constructed in Texas and it’s big enough to board a family of five and packs a gut-busting 35 million calories.

Members of the Bryan, Texas Traditions Club pitched in November 30 to snag the Guinness World Record with the help of nearly one ton of butter, 7,200 eggs, and thousands more pounds brown sugar and flour.

‘Basically it has everything but indoor plumbing,’ said Bill Horton, general manager of the Traditions Club.

World's largest: The world's largest gingerbread house has enough room for an entire family and has an exterior made entirely of gingerbread and icing

Butter: 1,800 pounds

Eggs: 7,200

Flour: 7,200 pounds

Brown Sugar: 3,000 pounds

Total Calories: 36 Million

Horton and his festive construction crew did something remarkable: the modest community of Bryan rallied around the fun and charitable cause and made holiday magic happen.

That’s 39,201.8 cubic feet of magic, according to TODAY.com—big enough to muscle out the previous record that was set in 2006 at Minnesota’s Mall of America.

‘I think what impresses me most is the community spirit around the record attempt,’ Horton’s colleague Michael Menchaha told CNN. ‘People came together for this remarkable cause and really worked hard at it.’

The astonishing home was built as a tourist attraction with proceeds all going to the trauma program at nearby St. Joseph Health System.

What’s more, nearly all the supplies used in the construction were donated.

Challenges: The house has seen its roadbumps including melting heat and dissolving rain and humidity that would make any gingerbread man wobble

Sweet deal: Proceeds benefit  the trauma program at nearby St. Joseph Health System

In less than a week, the house has raised $150,000 and attracts 600 people per night.

According to TODAY, a local home builder and architect designed the home, but it was Horton who dreamed it up.

‘I’m both a Food Network junkie and a Google guy, and twelve to fourteen months ago I saw something about gingerbread houses, and it spurred me to find out what the largest one ever built was,’ Horton said.

Once he found that out, there was no stopping him.

Not all sugar and spice: The house contains a skeleton of wood and that holds all the gingerbread together. But the entire facade is edible

Kind souls: The house was built entirely by volunteers and contains a whopping 22,300 pieces of candy

‘In June, I was at a luncheon with St. Joseph’s Hospital, and I got this crazy idea to build the world’s largest gingerbread house and combine it with their drive to build a center for their trauma program, and they bit,’ he explained.

The house construction was not without its kinks. Humidity and heat are issues they’ve had to contest with, but that’s not all.

‘The biggest issue has been bees,’ Horton said. ‘We called in a beekeeper the other night and he said there was a cluster of about 2,000 bees. We’ve worked all around them through the process. They’re not bothering us. They’re just getting drunk on sugar.’

The house costs $2 for children and $3 for adults and will stand through mid-December.
