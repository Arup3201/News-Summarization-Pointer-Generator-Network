Everyone has nodded off in front of a film that were looking forward to watching, only to miss the ending.

But this annoying problem could be a thing of the past as a team of hackers have proved that it is possible to use data collected from a Fitbit to determine if a viewer is asleep and pause a film on Netflix automatically.

The ‘Sleep Tracker’ software was created during an experimental Netflix Hack Day in California but there are no plans at present to roll out the technology.

Some people stay almost completely still while watching films, but the Fitbit can still tell the difference between someone resting and sleeping.

It uses an accelerometer to track a person's movements.

The device compares data so determine the normal amount of activity when a person is awake, with how much they move in sleep.

A video demonstrating the software shows a wearable Fitbit device, which tracks a person’s movements, communicating with Netflix on a laptop.

As the wearer of the Fitbit falls asleep, the device confirms a person's inactivity and 'tells' a the laptop to pause a film or programme.

The Fitbit device detects when a wearer has fallen asleep by using its accelerometer to detect movement.

When it sends data to with the laptop indicating that a person is asleep, Netflix gradually turns down the volume on the device and pauses the film or programme a person was watching so that they can sleep in peace.

The screen also displays a visual prompt so that when the viewer wakes up, they can see at what point they fell asleep during the film and how much is left.

When the user returns to Netflix after
 a break, they can see a series of messages or options so that they can 
resume viewing any programmes or films that they did not manage to stay awake through and 
can choose whether to resume their viewing from an old bookmark or the point at which 
they fell asleep.

While 
many people may be keen for the hack to be made available to the 
general public soon, a note attached to the video said: ‘The hack is the
 result of a fun, experimental and creative event at Netflix and does 
not suggest that Netflix will be pursuing this idea as a product 
improvement.’
