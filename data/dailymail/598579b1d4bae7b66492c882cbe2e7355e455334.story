Three Wall Street CEOs have revealed how finding out that their sons were gay transformed their views on homosexuality.

They all work in a macho environment and admitted to taking a dim view of gay rights. However, they began to champion them once their sons came out of the closet, they explained at a New York conference hosted by Out On The Street, an organization that promotes gay rights in the finance industry.

Paul Singer, the billionaire CEO of Elliott Management Corp, said that he was filled with ‘fear and nervousness’ when he suspected that his son, Andrew, was gay, partly because of concerns about health and grandfatherhood.

Opening up: Three Wall Street CEO's discussed at an Out On The Street conference how they felt when their sons came out. Pictured are Dan O'Connell (far left) and his son Jared, John Mack (center) sitting to the right of his son, Stephen, and Paul Singer (far right) sitting next to his son, Andrew

But when Andrew confirmed that he was indeed homosexual, his mindset changed.

He went from being ‘a solid 2.1’ out of 10, in terms of supporting  lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) issues, to a six. He added: ‘I think I’ve just risen from there,’ the Wall Street Journal reported.

Mr Singer is now a solid supporter of LGBT rights and has even lobbied the Republican Party to support them.

Former Morgan Stanley CEO John Mack went on a similar journey.

He described how he used to be ‘downright cruel’ to gay people in the North Carolina town where he grew up.

But when his son, Stephen, came out in 1997, at the age of 23, his views softened dramatically.

And the conversation was an easy one, in the end – partly because Mr Mack had already figured Stephen might be homosexual.

Mr Mack explained that he just wanted to know if his son was happy. ‘That’s all I cared about,’ he said.

Transformation: Dan O'Connell (left), the founder and CEO of private equity firm Vestar Capital Partners, said his son, Jared (right), coming out has made him much more accepting of gay rights

Dan O’Connell, the founder and CEO of private equity firm Vestar Capital Partners, meanwhile, said that he went from being ‘insensitive’ to homosexuality to being much more accepting, after his son Jared came out.

‘Better late than never,’ he said at the May 1 event.

The CEOs were speaking as a study by Human Rights Campaign revealed that over half of homosexuals in the U.S haven’t come out to their colleagues.
