Doctor Who has faced countless baddies over the centuries – but none quite so cute as this.

This squirrel took on the guise of the Time Lord’s persistent enemies the Cybermen thanks to a novelty feeder created by a devoted fan of the BBC sci-fi series.

Doctor Who ‘nut’ Emma Young spent hours creating it by taking apart a novelty radio, padding the rough edges with felt, filling it with a mix of peanuts and peanut butter, and hanging it at just the right height in her garden in Beaulieu, Hampshire. 

The first squirrel to approach was ‘very nervous,’ Emma said. 

‘But the smell of the peanuts quickly overcame any wariness, and he reached up and got stuck in.’

The 40-year-old mother of two added: ‘It was hilarious to watch. Well worth all the time and effort.’
