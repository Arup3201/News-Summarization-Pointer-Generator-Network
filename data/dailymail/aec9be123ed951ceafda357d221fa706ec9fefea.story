Michael Schumacher filmed the skiing accident which left him in a critical condition in hospital using a helmet camera which investigators hope may provide clues as to the cause of the crash, it is believed.

The seven times Formula One world champion remains in an induced coma in hospital in Grenoble, France, where he has undergone two operations to remove blood clots and relieve pressure on his brain.

Schumacher's family have given investigators the mini Go-Pro camera which was attached to his ski helmet and may contain crucial footage of the moment he lost control and hit his head on a rock.

Investigators are examining footage from a video camera attached to Michael Schumacher's skiing helmet, which they hope could help the determine the cause of the crash which has left him fighting for his life in hospital

The cameras, which are popular among extreme sports enthusiasts, have wide angle lenses that take in much of the view and can show parts of the user's body including the face depending on how it is mounted. The latest models can take up to 30 images a second for six hours.

If there are usable images they should shed light on the circumstances of the accident on a small off-piste section located between two ski slopes - one classed as easy and the other as intermediate.

A spokeswoman denied some reports that his family had been reluctant to hand over the camera - taken by authorities on Friday - because of privacy reasons.

'Michael's helmet camera was voluntarily given to the investigating authorities by the family,' said spokewoman Sabine Kehm in a statement. 'That this should have been done against the wishes of the family is untrue.'

It was not known whether the camera filmed the champion's descent down the slope or whether the images have been damaged by the impact on the rock.

Investigators also interviewed 
Schumacher's son Mick, 14, son, who was with his father at the time of 
the accident on the slopes of the French resort of Meribel last Sunday.

Conflicting
 statements have emerged, notably about how fast Schumacher was going 
when he crashed. Albertville prosecutors and the ski resort say 
Schumacher was skiing at great speed. Kehm has challenged that, saying 
he could not have been going fast 'because it appears he helped a friend
 who had just fallen'.

Investigators
 are tasked with determining responsibility in the accident, with high 
stakes possibly involved regarding any insurance compensation.

Prosecutors
 are also looking at whether the limits of the pistes next to the 
accident site were correctly marked, and whether the safety releases on 
Schumacher's skis operated properly.

'I
 don't think it's normal that between two marked slopes there would be 
this passage with rocks showing that is not fenced off,' said Philippe 
Streiff, a former French racing driver, in the French sports daily 
L'Equipe.

Although 
Schumacher was conscious when airlifted from the unmarked run in the 
Meribel resort, where he owns a property, he was agitated and soon fell 
into a coma, prompting his transfer to the Grenoble hospital.He has undergone two operations to remove blood and pressure from his brain.

Schumacher,
 who holds an unbeaten record of 91 race victories in a career spanning 
more than two decades, is understood to have been travelling off-piste 
at speed when he crashed, hitting his head on a boulder with such force 
that his helmet cracked in two.

His family had initially believed that
 the camera had also been broken, but a subsequent investigation 
revealed some of the footage was intact.

Schumacher was initially conscious before deteriorating into a critical condition.

Rescuers were on hand within minutes of the accident and he was airlifted to Grenoble hospital.

Doctors
 have said the impact caused numerous brain injuries including 
intracranial hematomas (multiple blood clots), bilateral lesions and 
bruising of the brain.

Today Schumacher's manager Sabine Kehm said he remains in a critical but stable condition.

It is believed he lost 
control after hitting a boulder which had been concealed by snow that had 
fallen the night before and was 'catapulted' headfirst into three other 
rocks.

An initial operation carried out on Sunday to 
reduce swelling was followed by a second to remove the largest of a 
number of clots in his brain.

Yesterday
 Schumacher's family say they have been 'utterly overwhelmed' and moved 
to tears by a birthday vigil held by scores of fans and well-wishers 
outside the hospital where he is being treated.

Schumacher should have been celebrating his 45th birthday with his family on Friday.

Some 200 people from Ferrari fan clubs
 based around Europe made the trip to the hospital, where a tribute was 
held in support of the seven-time Formula One world champion.

The scores of well-wishers also held a one-minute silence on Friday afternoon, the racer's 45th birthday.

Schumacher's
 family, who on Thursday said Michael 'is a fighter and will not give 
up' his fight for life, expressed their sincere appreciation following 
Friday's tributes, which were largely co-ordinated by Ferrari, with whom
 the German driver won five of his seven world titles.

'The incredible sympathies shown today by the Ferrari fans outside the hospital has utterly overwhemed us and moved us all to tears,' Schumacher's family said in a statement on his official website.

'We are deeply grateful for it and also for all the heartwarming and heartfelt wishes for Michael to get well soon, which have reached us from all over the world.'

No update was given on Schumacher's condition by the hospital or his management on Thursday and that remained the case on Friday.

Schumacher suffered major brain trauma in the accident which occurred when skiing off-piste in the resort of Meribel in France. It is believed that his life was saved by his skiing helmet, which split on impact.

titles in a row from 2000, has provided about 20 coaches across Italy to
