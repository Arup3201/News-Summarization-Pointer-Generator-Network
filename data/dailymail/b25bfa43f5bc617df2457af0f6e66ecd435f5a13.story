A group of pranksters made a homemade 'ejector seat' with an airbag and videoed their friend being blow up on it - leaving him with a fractured spine.

The men, from Haverhill, in Suffolk, uploaded the video on to YouTube, Facebook and LiveLeak yesterday and it has already received more than 10,000 views.

The video shows Hari Farlie, 19, sitting on two tyres with an unreleased airbag in between them, which is attached by a wire to a nearby car engine.

When one of the pranksters triggers the airbag, causing it to suddenly inflate, the teenager is violently thrown into the air and lands in a nearby bush.

As his friends laugh uproariously the youngster groans and holds his lower back.

The video then shows the now deflated airbag and tyres several feet away from where Hari is lying.

As the young man groans and writhes in agony the video shows his friends continue to laugh.

Kyle Lyons, 24, from Haverhill in Suffolk, posted the video on Facebook, and said that Hari suffered a fractured lumbar vertebra in the incident.

Mr Falrie was taken to hospital and a subsequent picture shows him lying on his side in hospital sucking  on gas and air.

Mr Lyon posted on YouTube last night that Hari fractured his spine in two places and will have to wear a back brace for the next three months, but added that he is now home from hospital. 

He said: ‘We asked him if he wanted to do it and he said he was up for it.’

He said they had the idea after helping a friend remove the airbags from his van and they created the contraption with the tyres, airbags, some wood, a couple of bricks and some jump leads.

Mr Lyon added they did not think Hari would have been seriously hurt in the incident.

He said: ‘We thought he would have bruised his coccyx, we didn’t expect him to break his back! ‘He said afterwards it would have been funnier if he had been standing up.

‘We do normally prank him – last week we put 200mg of Viagra in his cup of tea.

‘He didn’t realise until he got to the pub, he had to go to the toilet sitting down.

‘I don’t think he thought it was going to hurt as much. He couldn’t walk after it happened, he lay in the bush for about half an hour.

‘In the end we picked him up and took him to the hospital in my mate’s van.

‘He got back home yesterday, he only stayed in overnight. He seems to be doing alright, hes got crutches and a back brace.

‘We never thought it would go viral, just thought it would be a little prank.

‘He wanted to do it but I don’t think he knew what it would entail. He didn’t think it was going to hurt – he’s not the brightest one.

‘He’s sort of a guinea pig – we were going to paint him like a crash test dummy but we didn’t have time.

‘But he’s alright, it could have been worse. He could have been paralysed apparently.

‘We won’t be doing any more pranks for a few months.’
