He has spent the past year flying high in a helicopter but now he has taken on a desk job in London Prince Harry has swapped the skies for speed and taken delivery of a flashy new 174mph Audi.

Although his new toy - worth at least £59,530 - sets him apart from many other young men in Britain, the Prince then came back to down to earth by driving the gunmetal grey Audi 5S5 to an evening kick-about with a few close friends.

Last night Harry was seen playing football at a pitch in Battersea Park in the London Borough of Wandsworth on the south bank of the River Thames opposite Chelsea.

He has spent the past year flying high in a helicopter but now he has taken on a desk job in London Prince Harry has swapped the skies for speed and taken delivery of a flashy new 174mph Audi

Although his new toy - worth at least £59,530 - sets him apart from many other young men in Britain, the Prince then came back to down to earth by driving the gunmetal grey Audi 5S5 to an evening kick-about with friends including Tom Van Straubenzee, pictured, part-owns the Bodo's Schloss nightclub in Kensington and is married to Lady Melissa Percy

The Royal family are understood to be benefiting from a leasing arrangement by German car manufacturer Audi which could offer them up to a 60 per cent discount on their cars. As valued customers, the Royals are able to take advantage of the company's VIP terms and conditions - meaning their cars are also personally delivered

With his aggressive studs-up tackling,
 Prince Harry evoked Chelsea legend Ron ‘Chopper’ Harris with some ugly 
tackles in last year's fixture.

His
 robust style of play could have earned a red card if his boots had made
 contact with his opponent in a competitive game

But that didn’t stop 
him making other heavy-handed attempts to win the ball in a festive 
friendly – even if his brother William was on the receiving end.

An
 onlooker at the Christmas Eve game said: ‘William and Harry are both 
fairly reasonable players – but it seemed that Harry had the edge when 
it came to fitness. It is probably not surprising because Harry is a 
serving soldier and has just come back from a 200 mile trek to the South
 Pole.

Commanding presence: Prince Harry was seen playing football with friends in Battersea Park

Healthy and hale: The Royal looked trim as he enjoyed a kickabout with friends under the watchful eye of three royal protection police officers

Under the watchful eye of three royal protection police officers, the prince, wearing a grey T-shirt, black shorts and grey trainers in bright orange laces, dashed after the ball but didn't appear to have many touches.

After the game he was seen driving away with friend, Tom Van Straubenzee, who part-owns the Bodo's Schloss nightclub in Kensington and is married to  Lady Melissa Percy, the eldest daughter of the Duke of Northumberland.

Harry and William are both keen football fans and the younger prince has been snapped playing football at West Ham's Upton Park, with orphaned children during a visit to a children's centre in Lesotho, Africa and even in Afghanistan.

Every year the pair play a game involving estate workers near the Queen’s Sandringham Estate in Norfolk on Christmas Eve.

Trim: Army life appears to agree with Harry. In a football game with royal staff on Christmas Eve, the Prince was noted for his no-nonsense tackling

‘Harry was getting around all over the pitch and was beating his brother in most challenges, but William won his fair share of balls.

‘It was a very good-natured game with no serious fouls or injuries, but they were not shy about steaming into each other.’

In October The Duke of Cambridge kicked off the first football match to be played at Buckingham Palace - after warning that any players breaking windows would answer to the Queen.

Before kick-off, Prince William got involved in a kickabout and was spotted wearing a bright orange pair of boots... that once belonged to Wayne Rooney.

William helped to organise the match between two of England's oldest amateur clubs - Civil Service FC and Polytechnic FC - who took to the pitch marked out in the Queen's garden for a competitive amateur league fixture.

The Royal family are understood to be benefiting from a leasing arrangement by German car manufacturer Audi which could offer them up to a 60 per cent discount on their cars.

As valued customers, the Royals are able to take advantage of the company's VIP terms and conditions - meaning their cars are also personally delivered.

Such favourable leasing arrangements are not available to ordinary motorists and shows why the Royals have favoured the manufacturer over the last decade.

The Prince of Wales owns several models, including an A8 limousine that cost £92,500 and a pair of Allroad estate for personal use by himself and the Duchess of Cornwall.

He has also purchased two A4's for his staff.

Prince William drives a S4 saloon which has a 4.2 litre engine while the Duchess of Cambridge owns a silver A3 model.

The couple now also have a £250,000 Bentley for high-profile official engagements. 

In his first public visit to his prospective in-laws in 2009, William chose a black Audi for the journey to their home in Bucklebury, Berkshire, from his father’s Highgrove estate in Gloucestershire.

The deal with the company may also explain why its head of PR Jon Zamett was invited to the couple's wedding.

The manufacturer is understood to be investing thousands of pounds in boosting its image - and getting close to the Royals. They have made large donations to charities that are supported by the Princes and signed an agreement in 2005 to sponsor the English polo squad.

Marketing experts say that offering their cars at competitive rates could offer unique prestige.

Ian Stephens, of Saffron Brand Consultants, told the Times: 'Giving away cars is a bit sensitive.If you rent them at a discount you get around concerns over bribery or corruptions and still gain the association.'

'Audi are competing against other German and luxury brands that are established in the UK market, and they've always been outsiders. They are trying to buy their way into the establishment.'
