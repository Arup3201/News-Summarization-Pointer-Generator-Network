A man has been arrested by Los Angeles police after he stole the ambulance that had been treating him for hallucinations and crashed it into a minivan.

The unnamed male had been treated to what is believed to have been hallucinations caused by abusing the drug ‘spice’.

However, as Los Angeles Fire Department paramedics were caring for him, he suddenly ran off and stole the ambulance – with the medics still in it.

Thief: The unnamed man is taken into care before being arrested after he stole and crashed an LAFD ambulance while it was treating him for hallucinations

A Los Angles Fire Department ambulance had been called to the scene around 7.20pm on Friday after a man had complained of hallucinations after taking ‘spice’.

Two paramedics treated the man in the back of the vehicle when he suddenly ripped the IVs out of his arm and ran away, KTLA5 reports.

Thinking he had ran off, the paramedics informed LAPD of the incident and began cleaning up the mess left behind.

However, the man returned and before they knew it, he had jumped into the driver’s seat and started the ambulance.

As paramedics cared for the man, he ripped out the IV and ran off, but later returned and stole the ambulance 

Needing care: The man had told paramedics that he had taken drug 'spice' and was hallucinating

The man made it approximately two miles down the road before crashing the ambulance into a minivan 

Fearing for their lives, the two paramedics jumped out of the ambulance through the back doors.

A nearby LAFD vehicle started to pursue the ambulance, and less than two miles down the road, the man crashed into a minivan.

Two people travelling in the minivan sustained minor injuries and the ambulance thief was arrested.

The unnamed man can expect to be charged with carjacking and felony evading, officials said.

Police believe the man had either taken drugs, as he himself told ambulance staff, or that he suffers from mental illness.
