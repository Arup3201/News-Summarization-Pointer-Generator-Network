Chasing suspected thieves through suburban back  gardens, the police dog was merciless when its prey came into sight.

Unfortunately, instead of catching a criminal, the highly-trained canine sunk its powerful teeth into George the rabbit.

The much-loved pet had no chance when the dog ‘simply acted on its natural instincts’.

The 13-year-old rabbit was mauled and died moments later in the arms of his heartbroken owner Melissa Richardson, 20.

Melissa Richardson is seen kissing her pet rabbit George just hours before the pet was killed by a bloodthirsty police dog that was chasing suspected thieves in the vicinity of the family home in York

After letting him out of his hutch to enjoy the fresh air, she had looked through the window to see the dog jump over the fence.

‘George was pottering around but the dog ran up to the hutch, where my three other rabbits were,’ she said. ‘It was barking like mad and scratching at the hutch trying to get at them. That was when it turned and saw George.

‘It ran up and started shaking him. I ran out shouting and that was when the handler jumped over the fence. He shouted at the dog to drop George but it wouldn’t.

‘It went on for about a minute but, at the time, it seemed like forever. I was screaming and sobbing but there was nothing I could do.’

Miss Richardson, a support worker from York, said George was ‘covered in blood’ when the dog eventually dropped him.

‘I picked him up and carried him inside and he died in my arms about a minute later,’ she added.

‘I was inconsolable. I’ve had George since I was seven and can’t put into words how I felt being  unable to protect him. The dog was clearly out of control and had run away from its handler.

‘The men they were chasing hadn’t even been in our garden.

‘I don’t even want to think about what would have happened if there had been kids in the garden.

‘I’ve
been devastated. I haven’t been eating properly and had to leave work 
early because I couldn’t stop crying. Not being able to give George a 
cuddle has left me heartbroken.’

Officers from North Yorkshire Police consoled Miss Richardson and she also received a personal apology from Sergeant Simon Whitby, head of the dog section.

He said: ‘We all feel terrible and  have apologised profusely for the distress this has caused.

‘The police dog simply acted on its natural instincts and grabbed hold of the rabbit.’

Miss Richardson, who buried George in the garden that evening, said she turned down a police offer to buy her a replacement pet.

‘Some people might think that it’s only a rabbit, but I’d had him for so long, he was like family,’ she said. ‘I’d give him cuddles and let him out so he could roam the  garden. I really miss him.’

Police said youths were seen  running into gardens on Tuesday around 6pm after power tools were stolen from a car.

Two 18-year-olds were arrested that evening and released on bail pending further inquiries.

A 19-year-old arrested the next day remains in police custody.
