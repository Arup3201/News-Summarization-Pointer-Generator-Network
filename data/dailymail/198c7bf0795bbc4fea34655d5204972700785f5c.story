Western Europe's lemmings were killed off five times during the last Ice Age because of their inability to deal with rapid climate change, say scientists.

Other small mammal species may have met a similar fate, experts believe.

The finding casts further doubt on claims that humans were largely to blame for the disappearance of large Ice Age animals such as the woolly mammoth, giant deer and cave bear.

Age because of fluctuations in temperature

It suggests that a series of short-lived warm periods led to inhospitable environments for many cold-adapted animals, leading to the collapse of local ecosystems.

Scientists analysed DNA from caves in Belgium and the UK to track the evolution of the collared lemming over a period of 50,000 years.

Previously experts thought the lemming, and other small mammals, only vanished from more southern regions when the climate began to warm around 10,000 years ago.

Scientists have found that the 'greening' of the Arctic many not be solely caused by global warming, as previously believed, but the environmental impact of lemmings, whose presence causes lichens to be replaced by grasses and sedge.

Scientists still do not know what the net effects of this greening might be on climate.

They fear greenhouse gas being released byÂ  bacteria responsible for plant decomposition. But, on the other hand, the plants act as important 'sink' soaking carbon up from the atmosphere.

A U.S. study last year found that when lemmings are absent, the Arctic tundra is likely to be more barren and covered in lichens and moss. But where lemmings live there is a surprising increase in grass and sedge.

One reason for the trend may be the waste products of large numbers of lemmings fertilising the soil, say the researchers.

'By focusing on a small mammal, we could
remove the possibility that humans were having any significant impact 
on their population size - lemmings are just too numerous and prolific,'
said lead researcher Dr Ian Barnes, from Royal Holloway, University of 
London.

'So any changes in the population had to be linked to wider environmental changes.'

Colleague Dr Selina Brace, also from Royal Holloway, said: 'While lemmings have an undeserved reputation for leaping off cliffs, in reality they are critical prey species for many arctic animals, and removing them from the ecosystem would have massive knock-on effects for predators.'

Scientists have known for a long time that the Ice Ages led to diversification and speciation in many animals.

However, the new study, published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, is one of the first to demonstrate that climatic change during the last Ice Age was an important driver of extinction.

During this period, lemmings in western Europe were wiped out five times. Each extinction was followed by a recolonisation of genetically different lemmings.

'That the lemmings in western Europe became extinct five times during the last Ice Age is unparalleled among mammals,' said co-author Eleftheria Palkopoulou, from the Swedish Museum of Natural History.

'We were really surprised by this finding.'
