Strikers can be the difference between Champions League qualification or twiddling your thumbs for the next season and, as the transfer window closes, clubs now know what they have at their disposal.

Chelsea, Liverpool, Arsenal and the two Manchester giants have chosen their deadliest finishers, but how do each of the big five shape up just three games into the new campaign?

Here, Sportsmail examine and rate the three key strikers of the top five Premier League clubs.

Manchester City (rated 24.5 out of 30)

Born: Argentina, June 2 1988 (age 26)

Premier League record: 90 apps (54 gls)

Sergio Aguero (9/10)

A name synonymous with that unforgettable piece of commentary as Aguero's 95th-minute winner against QPR saw City crowned Premier League champions of 2011-12. Deadly, composed, and there when he's relied upon.

Nine out of 10: Striker Sergio Aguero has proved himself deadly for Manchester City in the Premier League 

Born: Yugoslavia, March 17 1986 (age 28)

Premier League record: 108 apps (46 gls) 

Edin Dzeko (8/10)

The towering Bosnia striker's impressive goal record somewhat creeps up on you. The under-rated centre forward, while not always first choice, can be world-class on his day at the age of 28.

He's gr-eight: Edin Dzeko is an under-rated striker with a record to prove worthy of the Premier League giants

Born: Yugoslavia, Nov 2 1989 (age 24)

Premier League record: 13 apps (5 gls)

Stevan Jovetic (7.5/10)

Jovetic gave a glimpse of what he can do with a brace against Liverpool. Must put his injury-plagued debut season last year behind him and compete to be in the starting XI. Not a bad problem for Manuel Pellegrini to have.

Coming to the fore: Stevan Jovetic's Premier League career is just 13 games old, but he looks the part

Born: Brazil, October 7 1988 (age 25)

Premier League record: 3 apps (4 gls) 

Chelsea (24 out of 30)

Diego Costa (9/10)

Costa got life in the Premier League off to a better start than Aguero, Ruud van Nistelrooy, Fernando Torres and more. Already looks the answer to Jose Mourinho's prayers, and never a dull moment with the La Liga winner on the pitch.

Super start: There is never a dull moment when Diego Costa plays and Chelsea look glad to have the striker

Born: France, January 2 1987 (age 27)

Premier League record: 41 apps (20 gls) 

Loic Remy (7.5/10)

A proven goalscorer in the Premier League with QPR and Newcastle, and nominated to fill Fernando Torres's barely-worn shoes. Could be considered a steal at £8million, should Mourinho make use of his new forward.

Bargain buy: Loic Remy, former QPR and Newcastle striker, could prove a steal at £8million

Born: Ivory Coast, March 11 1978 (age 36)

Chelsea record: 229 apps (100 gls) 

Didier Drogba (7.5/10)

A Chelsea hero for his exploits against Bayern Munich in the Champions League final of 2012. Those at Stamford Bridge need not fret if the strong striker is occasionally relied upon, even at the age of 36.

Ideal foil: Didier Drogba, at the age of 36, can provide cover for Costa and Co in the Chelsea strike force

Born: England, October 24 1985 (age 28)

Premier League record: 375 apps (174 gls) 

Manchester United (26 out of 30)

Wayne Rooney (8.5/10)

The England and United captain looks very much part of Louis van Gaal's plans for the reconstruction period at Old Trafford. Ten years since signing, on £300,000-a-week and at the age of 28, Rooney must repay the faith.

Leading role: Wayne Rooney signed 10 years ago and must prove worthy of his captaincy

Born: Holland, Aug 6 1983 (age 31)

Premier League record: 272 apps (144 gls) 

Robin van Persie (8.5/10)

It was United's new utility player Daley Blind who assisted that iconic diving header from Van Persie at the World Cup in Brazil. Can prove clinical for Van Gaal - if fitness persists - and is knowingly feared by opposition defenders.

Dutch destroyer: Robin van Persie can be as deadly as ever for Louis van Gaal, if fitness keeps up

Born: Colombia, February 10 1986 (age 28)

La Liga record: 68 apps (52 gls) 

Radamel Falcao (9/10)

Not the signing United, nor the footballing world, expected. Yet Van Gaal couldn't resist. The Premier League debutant is a classic modern-day striker - big, fast-paced, quick-footed and strong, big. With United's seemingly weak defence, a frighteningly-good front line may be necessary.

Loan star: Radamel Falcao is new to the Premier League but has every chance of fulfilling his potential

Born: England, September 1 1989 (age 25)

Premier League record: 142 apps (58 gls)

Liverpool (24.5 out of 30)

Daniel Sturridge (9/10)

Shouldered the responsibility at Anfield following Luis Suarez's departure, and doesn't look deterred. The England striker, packed with talent, knows how to influence a game. Forever a threat with Sturridge on the pitch.

Main man: Daniel Sturridge is forever a threat in front of goal and is now Liverpool's go-to guy up the top

Born: Italy, August 12 1990 (age 24)

Premier League record: 55 apps (20 gls) 

Mario Balotelli (8.5/10)

A bad boy, a liability, an unpredictable character, what else? Call him what you will, but Balotelli will excel if Brendan Rodgers can curb the striker's behaviour that earned him his infamous reputation. Easy to forget he's still 24.

Unpredictable: Mario Balotelli, known as a bad boy, can excel under new manager Brendan Rodgers

Born: England, February 16 1982 (age 32)

Premier League record: 77 apps (28 gls)

Rickie Lambert (7/10)

Yet to get off the mark for his boyhood club - both in pre-season and the Premier League - but more often than not in the right place at the right time for Southampton. The goal should come, if the minutes follow under Rodgers.

Looking to kick on: Rickie Lambert should get off the mark for Liverpool soon  if he gets sufficient game time

Born: France, September 30 1986 (age 27)

Premier League record: 72 apps (28 gls)

Arsenal (20.5 out of 30)

Olivier Giroud (7.5/10)

Injury aside, Giroud knows how to outwit a defence. The striker, out for four months after having surgery on a broken leg, will  be key to Arsene Wenger's  push for a coveted top-four spot. Pressure to hit the ground running.

Focal point: Olivier Giroud knows how to outwit a defence but his injury will keep him frustrated

Born: France, January 27 1993 (age 21) 

Premier League record: 10 apps (0 gls) 

Yaya Sanogo (5/10)

Wenger hoped Sanogo would be a worthy replacement for Giroud. Sadly, he looks anything but. The former France Under 21 striker doesn't look Premier League material as of yet. Still just 21, though, but has competition up front now.

Weak link: Yaya Sanogo is yet to look Premier League material at Arsenal with no goals in 10 matches

Born: England, November 23 1990 (age 23)

Premier League record: 116 apps (26 gls)

Danny Welbeck (8/10)

A Marmite character. You either love him or hate him, but Wenger files himself in the former category after splashing £16m on the forward. Given a run in the Arsenal first team, though, and we may see a more noticeable Welbeck.

Marmite: Danny Welbeck's £16m move to Arsenal from Manchester United gives him a real chance
