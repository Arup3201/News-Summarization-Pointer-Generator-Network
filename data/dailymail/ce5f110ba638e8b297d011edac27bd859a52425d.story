Paul Nicholls still regards Zarkandar as his No 1 World Hurdle hope despite bookmakers having Saturday’s Cleeve Hurdle winner Saphir Du Rheu shorter in the betting.

Ladbrokes, sponsors of the Cheltenham Festival target run over three miles, make Saphir Du Rheu the 7-1 second favourite behind defending champion More Of That after his successful switch back to hurdling following a mixed foray into the novice chase arena.

Saphir Du Rheu received 4lb and beat Reve De Sivola a neck at Cheltenham.

In contrast, Zarkandar, a 10-1 shot, was beaten a head on level terms by the same rival in last month’s Long Walk Hurdle at Ascot when he appeared to throw away victory when idling after jumping into the lead at the last flight.

Quoted of his website, Nicholls said: ‘Long term I still see Saphir Du Rheu as a top-class chaser who could well be heading for the Cheltenham Gold Cup in March next year.

‘First though comes the World Hurdle in which we also run Zarkandar, who is arguably our No 1 contender as he is more streetwise and has much more experience.

‘But Saphir Du Rheu has a decent chance, too. There is plenty of improvement to come as I was a little worried that he might be a bit short of fitness going to Cheltenham after a stop start campaign. The race will have brought him on and we know now that he stays the trip well.’

Meanwhile, Nicholls has entered Irish Saint in this Saturday’s big race at Sandown, the two-and-a-half mile Grade One Scilly Isles Novices’ Chase.

The six-year-old, a winner at Ascot last month, has already run twice at Sandown, winning in November before finishing third to stablemare Vibrato Valtat in the Grade One Henry VIII Novices’ Chase over two miles.

Other entries for the Scilly Isles include Nicky Henderson’s Josses Hill, last season’s Supreme Novices’ Hurdle winner who has not convinced with his jumping in his first two starts over fences.

Alan King has entered Grumeti, Nigel Twiston-Davies put in Splash Of Ginge while Willie Mullins has three possibles including Gitane Du Berlais.
