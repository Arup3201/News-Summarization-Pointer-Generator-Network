The Syrian president Bashar Assad has vowed to 'cleanse' the country of Muslim extremists whom he blames for a suicide blast that killed dozens of people, including a top Sunni preacher who was a staunch supporter of his regime.

Today British scientists working for MI6 were 
testing soil smuggled out of Syria following reports the Assad regime 
used nerve gas in an attack on rebel soldiers.

A team at Porton Down, the Ministry of Defence's chemical research centre in Wiltshire is testing the soil for traces of the nerve agent Sarin, the Daily Telegraph reported.

Rebels claim forces loyal to 
President Bashar Assad used the gas during an attack near Aleppo on 
Tuesday. The US and the UN have announced they are also investigating the claims.

If Syria is found to have used 
chemical weapons it will increase the pressure on the UN to approve 
military intervention in the country.

In a warning to rebels battling 
to topple his regime, the Syrian leader pledged that his troops will 
'wipe out' and clean the country of the 'forces of darkness'.

Assad's statement came as the Syrian 
Health Ministry raised the death toll from the Thursday night bombing in
Damascus to 49, after seven of the wounded died overnight in hospital.

In the attack, a suicide bomber blew 
himself up inside a mosque in the heart of the Syrian capital, killing 
Sheikh Mohammad Said Ramadan al-Buti as he was giving a sermon. The 
blast also wounded 84 people.

Killed: Sheikh Mohammad Said Ramadan al-Buti, an 84-year-old Sunni cleric and longtime supporter of President Bashar Assad was killed in a suicide bombing in the Eman Mosque in Damascus

It was one of the most stunning 
assassinations of the two-year civil war and marked a new low in the 
conflict: while suicide bombings blamed on Islamic extremists fighting 
with the rebels have become common, the latest attack was the first time
a suicide bomber detonated his explosives inside a mosque. The grandson
of the 84-year-old al-Buti was among those killed in the attack.

In
the statement carried by Syria's state SUNA news agency, Assad said 
al-Buti represented true Islam in facing 'the forces of darkness and 
extremist' ideology.

'Your
blood and your grandson's, as well as that of all the nation's martyrs 
will not go in vain because we will continue to follow your thinking to 
wipe out their darkness and clear our country of them," said Assad.

Syria's
crisis started in March 2011 as peaceful protests against Assad's 
authoritarian rule. The revolt turned into a civil war as some 
opposition supporters took up arms the fight a harsh government 
crackdown on dissent.

The U.N. says more than 70,000 people have been killed since.Â  It was not immediately clear when al-Buti's funeral would take place.

The government declared Saturday as a
day of mourning and state-run Syrian TV halted its regular programs on 
Friday to air readings from the Muslim holy book, the Quran, as well as 
speeches of the late cleric.

Al-Buti was the most senior religious figure to be killed in Syria's civil war and his slaying was a major blow to Assad.

The preacher had been a vocal 
supporter of the regime since the early days of Assad's father and 
predecessor, the late President Hafez Assad, providing a Sunni cover and
legitimacy to their rule. Sunnis are the majority sect in Syria while 
Assad is from the minority Alawite sect - an offshoot of Shiite Islam.

In a speech earlier this month, al-Buti had said it was "a religious duty to protect the values, the land and the nation" of Syria.

'There is no difference between the army and the rest of the nation,' he said at the time - a clear endorsement of Assad's forces in their effort to crush the rebels.

The mosque bombing was also among the most serious security breaches in Damascus. In July, an attack that targeted a high-level government crisis meeting killed four top regime officials, including Assad's brother-in-law and the defense minister.

Last month, a car bomb that struck in the same area, which houses the headquarters of Syria's ruling Baath party, killed at least 53 people and wounded more than 200.
