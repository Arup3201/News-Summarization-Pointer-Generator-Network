The entire U.S. fleet of Boeing 787 Dreamliners have been temporarily grounded after a second battery failure caused one of the massive aircrafts to make an emergency landing in Japan.

The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration said on Wednesday it would temporarily ground the fleet until airlines could demonstrate that the lithium ion batteries involved were safe.

However, the FAA's emergency order affects only United Airlines, the lone U.S. carrier to operate 787s; in all, it has six Dreamliners.

Boeing said in a statement it was confident the 787 was safe and that it stood by the plane's integrity.

The FAA decision was another setback for a plane that was supposed to establish a new standard for jet travel but has instead been beset by one mishap after another.

The latest trouble arose when pilots for Japan's All Nippon Airways smelled something burning and received a cockpit warning of battery problems on a flight from Yamaguchi Ube airport in western Japan to Tokyo.

They made an emergency landing Wednesday at Takamatsu airport in western Japan, and passengers had to evacuate using inflatable slides.

An inspection found that a flammable liquid had leaked from the main lithium-ion battery below and slightly behind the cockpit. Investigators found burn marks around the damage.

Japan's Kyodo News agency quoted a transport ministry investigator as saying that the liquid leaked through the electrical room floor to the outside of the aircraft. The transport ministry said the leak could have led to an accident.

That problem followed a January 7 battery fire aboard a Japan Airlines plane parked at Boston's Logan Airport.

Both incidents involved the same type of battery, raising worries that the jet's electrical problems could be more dangerous than previously thought.

Aviation authorities in other countries usually follow the lead of the country where the manufacturer is based.

Celebrated: The Dreamliner was celebrated in Long Beach, California in March; each plane costs more than $200million

Behemoth: The Dreamliner seats 210 to 330 passengers, depending on variant. Boeing states that it is the company's most fuel-efficient airliner

Boeing said in a statement that it is working 'around the clock' with its customers and investigative authorities. Chief Executive Jim McNerney said that the company is 'committed to supporting the FAA and finding answers as quickly as possible.'

The 787, which has a list price of $207 million, represents a leap in the way planes are designed and built, but the project has been plagued by cost overruns and years of delays.

Some have suggested Boeing's rush to get planes built after those delays resulted in the recent problems, a charge the company denies.

According to flight tracking website FlightAware, some seven Dreamliners were in the air Wednesday night as the FAA order came down, including a United Airlines flight that left Los Angeles for Houston just a few minutes before the order.

United said the planes already in the air would land as scheduled and that it would immediately comply with the FAA order.

The use of new battery technology is among the cost-saving features of the 787, which Boeing says burns 20 percent less fuel than rival jetliners using older technology.

Lithium-ion batteries can catch fire if they are overcharged and, once alight, they are difficult to put out as the chemicals produce oxygen, Boeing's chief engineer for the 787, Mike Sinnett, told reporters last week.

QATAR AIRWAYS uses its five Dreamliners for services to London, Munich, Zurich and Frankfurt.AIR INDIA has six Dreamliners which it uses on domestic routes as well international services from India to Dubai, Frankfurt and Paris

ETHIOPIAN AIRLINES operates four Dreamliners on flights from to Johannesburg, Washington D.C., Toronto, Frankfurt, Beijing, Lusaka and Harare

LOT POLISH AIRLINES has two Dreamliners used on flights between Warsaw and London Heathrow and Warsaw and Vienna

ALL NIPPON AIRLINES had been operating 17 Dreamliners on domestic routes as well as international flights including a service from Tokyo to San Jose in the U.S.

JAPAN AIRLINES has seven Dreamliners which had been used on services between Haneda and Singapore, Narita and Boston, and Narita and Singapore

UNITED AIRLINES has six Dreamliners operating on domestic services mainly from their Houston hub to destinations such as San Fransisco, Chicago, Newark, Cleveland and Washington Dulles. An international service between Houston and Amsterdam was scheduled to begin on December 4.

Services between L.A. and Tokyo, Houston and Lagos, Nigeria were expected to begin early this year

He said lithium-ion was not the only battery choice, but 'it was the right choice'.

In Asia, only the Japanese and Air India have the Dreamliner in service, but other airlines are among those globally to have ordered around 850 of the new aircraft.

Boeing has said it will at least break even on the cost of building the 1,100 new 787s it expects to deliver over the next decade.

Some analysts, however, say Boeing may never make money from the aircraft, given its enormous development cost.

Any additional cost from fixing problems discovered by the string of recent incidents would affect those forecasts and could hit Boeing's bottom line more quickly if it has to stop delivering planes, analysts said.

In the latest incident, All Nippon Airways Co Ltd said instruments aboard a domestic flight indicated a battery error, triggering emergency warnings.

The incident was described by a transport ministry official as 'highly serious' - language used in international safety circles as indicating there could have been an accident.

That led ANA and Japan Airlines Co Ltd to ground their 24 Dreamliners pending checks.

Japanese transportation officials said they could not immediately comment on the FAA decision, as did a spokesman for JAL.

An ANA spokeswoman said the FAA's order meant the airline could not use its 787s on its U.S. routes.

Review: Boeing will work with the FAA to discern the root of the problem with the massive aircraft

But barring a prolonged grounding or a severe and uncontained crisis, aircraft industry sources say there is no immediate threat of cancellations for the plane, even after the FAA's decision to halt 787 flights.

Among other reasons, they cite the heavy costs of retraining and investing in new infrastructure, as well as a shortage of alternatives in an industry dominated by just two large jet suppliers.

The Dreamliner's problems could sharpen competition between Boeing and its European rival Airbus, which itself experienced a dip in sales for its A380 superjumbo following problems with wing cracks a year ago.

The A380 crisis has since eased and most airlines report the aircraft are flying full.
