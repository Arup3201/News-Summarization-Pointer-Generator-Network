In a surreal new set of fashion images, models dressed in couture appear dazed and ethereal, floating upside down on streets and in shops in the Far East.

Photographer Martin Tremblay, aka Le Pinch, shot the images for a British fashion magazine. Each portrait blends reality with surrealist settings in a curious, inverted world.

In an MailOnline exclusive, the photographer here reveals the secret behind his surreal, gravity-defying shoot.

Topsy-turvy: Models appear suspended upside down in an unusual magazine shoot

He explained how the mind-boggling images were created using computer trickery.

'First I shot many backgrounds with a little lighting punch of flash,' says Tremblay, 44, from Montréal, Quebec. 'After, we shot the models In studio with a trampoline to make it fit on the selected images.

'I made a ceiling with cardboard to flatten down the hair. I shot the shoes after and put everything together in Photoshop.'

Despite seemingly floating at zero gravity, models retain utmost elegance, and the surreal compositions in Far Eastern urban settings compliment the beautiful clothes.

Tremblay plays with ideas of reality, creating wacky hair styles and using props (and even pets) to add to the optical illusion.

Innovative: The photographer said he wanted to do 'something different'

Tremblay pushes the boundaries of 
traditional fashion photography by (literally) turning it on its head, 
forcing viewers to do a double take.

'I simply wanted to do something different by creating a link between two opposite worlds,' he says.

'As
 one woman has one experience in the world we see, something else is 
happening to someone else in exactly that same moment at exactly the 
opposite end of the globe.'

Tremblay, who has been shooting for more than 20 years, thought up the concept and pitched it to Schön! magazine, who commissioned him for the photos.

The series, dubbed 'Fortune Cookie', is now gaining widespread acclaim.

All creative teams involved would settle for no less than stunning, timelessness, perfect execution

The project took two years to research 
and required 160 hours of retouching. All creative teams involved would 
settle for no less than stunning, timelessness, perfect execution down 
to the slightest detail.

'It was my idea. My motivation was to create a non conventional fashion shoot,' Tremblay said.

The photographer studied his subject for three years after making a drastic career change. He has previously worked as an 
underground miner driller-dynamiter in the north of Quebec.

He now enjoys a career shooting mainly advertising campaigns, corporate projects and art.

'I
 am very perfectionist and understanding light for me is capital. I find
 very interesting to create different worlds,' he says.

'Despite
 the fact that the world I create are often surreal, I always look for 
truth, high standard in execution, design and detailing.'
