Shinji Kagawa is said to be 'hugely relieved' at escaping his Manchester United nightmare and returning to former club Borussia Dortmund.

The Japan international struggled to convince a succession of managers that he was worthy of a regular starting place after arriving at Old Traffford for £12million in 2012.

The 25-year-old was eventually offloaded by Louis van Gaal for a cut price £6.3million in the summer to be reunited with coach Jurgen Klopp - who has claimed the playmaker's treatment at United reduced him to tears.

Dortmund teammate Sebastian Kehl has backed Kagawa to rediscover his form in the Bundesliga after seeing him score 13minutes into his comeback during a behind-closed-doors match between Dortmund and their Under 23 side.

'You could see that it was a huge relief for Shinji Kagawa [to have left Manchester United for Dortmund],' Kehl was quoted as saying by Sport Bild.

'It was not an easy situation for him at Manchester in the past few weeks. And then there were some comments from his coach that prompted him to return to Dortmund.

'He gets a lot of faith here. Everything that he's been missing in the past few months, he'll get back here again.'

Meanwhile, Kagawa appeared equally enthused about his return when he spoke last week.

He said, 'The day I left, I said in an interview that the chapter Borussia Dortmund was not closed in my life. I wanted to fulfill my dream of playing in the Premier League.

'Now I am simply delighted to be back in Dortmund with this fantastic team and set-up and these unique fans.

'BVB is like a family and I am proud that they did not forget me and that I can belong to it once more.'.
