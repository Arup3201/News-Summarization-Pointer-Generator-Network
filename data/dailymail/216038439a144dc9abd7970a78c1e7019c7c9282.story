An intriguing set of pictures reveals the hidden emotional lives of subjects who agreed to have their portrait taken.

The work of international photographer Christopher Dodd, the photo series aims to show a side of the citizens of London usually kept locked away.

Sixteen very different individuals were cast to sit for a portrait on the proviso that they, in turn, gave up one secret to sit beside their portrait, with some moving and poignant revelations coming out of the project.

Ceci, 35, confesses she kept a tooth of her late father's before burying him in Shanghai

Many of the secrets reveal a huge about of inner pain on the part of the subject, with the secrets adding an additional depth and significance to the accompanying pictures.

Gary 24, confesses: ‘I am in love with my best friend who does not feel the same. It has put a strain on our friendship which I feel guilty for. I suffer in silence with this secret with no one to talk to.’

One boy, identified only as Ali, 17, writes: ‘There is one person I hate most of all, it’s myself. Don’t know why, I just don’t like him.’

Another woman, aged 35, confesses to a dark secret regarding the remains of her dead father.

‘This is Ceci. Back in 2008 I buried my father’s urn outside the city of Shaghai. Approx 9200km away from where I’m right now...That box is missing one thing; a tooth of him. I took it with me the night before. Cos just being his daughter having his blood in me isn’t enough for me to keep it going. I didn’t know how to deal without him.’

Priscilla, 62, admits she owns a stolen cat, and that her husband still thinks that it was an orphan

London based photographer Christopher, who posted the pictures to his website says that he undertook the project due to his belief in the power of photography to help people open up.

‘The
 project idea comes from years of shooting. I have worked with an array 
of people, sitting for various situations from all walks of life. Each 
person always had a story to tell which made them comfortable when 
sitting for the photo,’ he explains.

‘So
 this led onto the idea that people when put into an uncomfortable 
situation always tend to reveal more than they would usually to relax 
themselves.

‘From that
 detail, I thought up the project and asked people to sit for a portrait
 but in turn they must tell me a secret that nobody else knows and the 
use of photo would help them release that secret to the public.

Many of the secrets reveal inner pain, such as Will, 43, who says he tried to kill himself 25 years ago

‘The secrets where so vast it was incredible to hear each and every one. Some very moving, some very shocking and the rest very rude, but I take this as a slice of London and what you see on the surface is not always what you actually get.

‘Everyone has secrets; we just need to be brave to unlock them sometimes.'

In one photo a 43-year-old man confesses that at 25 he tried to kill himself after being seduced by an older man.

Another subject, confessed that after neutering and vaccinating a cat she thought was a stray - it then came back with a collar and a phone number which she promptly threw away.

The project follows the growing trend of telling, rather than repressing, our darkest innermost thoughts.

Website Post Secret and the Whisper app have both created a worldwide following on their 'secret sharing' premises, with thousands combining art with revealing their secret, creating a sense of community artwork as well as lessening the feeling of solitude so many feel when holding onto a secret.

Christopher's project, of course, removes the anonymity that the other secret sharing projects grant, which is perhaps why it carries such an emotional weight for those who view the photographs.
