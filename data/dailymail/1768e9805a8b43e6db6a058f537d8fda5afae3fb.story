A 15-year-old schoolgirl who died after falling from a historic monument following an argument with her boyfriend sent him a text message in which she threatened to 'jump off the tower' prior to her death, an inquest heard.  

Ashli Blake, who was born with the surname Cook, was found dead by her boyfriend Marcus Webb on land close to a historic monument, near Rockbourne, Hampshire, in the early hours of September 21.

At an inquest into her death today, the coroner heard how the schoolgirl sent a text message to Mr Webb, who was five years her senior, prior to her death in which she threatened to kill herself.

The message read: 'I am going to jump off the tower. If we can't be together, I don't want to be here anymore. Bye.'

At an inquest into her death today, the coroner heard how Ashli, 15, sent a text message to her boyfriend Marcus Webb (pictured together above) prior to her death in which she threatened to 'jump off the tower'

The coroner was also told how she had suffered 'some bullying problems' at the Burgate School in Fordingbridge, in the lead up to her tragic death. 

A post-mortem examination found that she died of multiple injuries, the inquest at Winchester Coroner's Court was told.

The inquest heard how Ashli had spent the day prior to her death with Mr Webb, but ended up storming out of his mother's home following an argument. 

The coroner was told she stormed out of the house yelling 'I'm going to f****** kill myself' following a row in which she accused him of trying to get close to one of her friends. 

Mr Webb, who discovered her body after launching a desperate search when he and her family failed to get hold of her, told how he had not believed her threats because she had made similar comments previously.

In a statement read to the inquest, Mr Webb said: 'I feel so guilty and I feel like it was my fault, she told me she was going to kill herself and even told me where she was going to do it and I laughed at her because I didn't believe her.

'Ashli meant more than life itself to me, I would do nothing to hurt her, I now feel there's no reason being here.'

Mr Webb said he had visited the tower several times with Ashli and it was where they had taken their photograph together when they started going out three years earlier.

Her mother, Canasta Blake, 37, who has another daughter and a son, told how the young couple had made plans for the rest of their lives together.

She said in a statement: 'They had made plans for the rest of their lives together - at 16 she was going to move in with him.

'She was besotted with him. She was always worried about him and what he was doing.

'I do not understand why she did this, she had everything to live for and often spoke of the future. 

An inquest into her death in Winchester heard she was battling bullying at school prior to her death

'I think, for her age, she was immature, in her laughing, giggling and making up silly words. Ashli was a lovely young girl, was imaginative, different and quirky, she had her own special dress sense.

'She would have grown up to be a lovely person.'

She said Ashli had suffered from some bullying problems with other girls at her school but she had not expressed any wish not to attend school because of it.

Ms Blake added that Ashli was working hard at her studies and had told family members she wanted to become an art therapist or an accountant.

Ashli's GP, Dr Charlotte Hillsley, at Fordingbridge Surgery, said she had suffered from low moods and sleeping problems.

She had previously been referred to the Hampshire Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services but had been discharged.

However, in July she had returned to the surgery and was referred again to the clinic and was placed on its waiting list.

In a statement read to the inquest, Dr Hillsley said: 'Ashli had low mood and poor sleep and was struggling with bullying at school.

'Her mother had told me she had removed razor blades from the house and taken them to work with her because she was concerned that she may self-harm.'

Ashli's mother Canasta Blake was supported at the inquest by her partner Craig Warrilow while pathologist Dr Eleanor Jaynes told the inquest the schoolgirl had taken no alcohol or drugs prior to her death

Deer stalker John Powell, who was out hunting near the monument on the night of Ashli's death, was the last person to see her alive.

As he watched for deer with his rifle, he told the inquest that he spotted a young girl leaping over the stile into the field and walking towards the monument alone and with purpose.

Pathologist Dr Eleanor Jaynes told the inquest the schoolgirl had taken no alcohol or drugs prior to her death and had died of multiple traumatic injuries due to a fall from a height.

Central Hampshire Coroner Grahame Short recorded a verdict that she had intended to take her own life.

He said: 'Ashli was a deeply troubled girl but I find that she chose to end her life on this occasion.'

He added: 'It's clear that she had a boyfriend, Marcus Webb, and I find that she was very much in love with him to a degree that only a teenager can be.'

In the wake of her death, staff at The Burgate School said they were 'shocked and saddened' to hear of the tragedy.

A school spokesman said: 'We are shocked and saddened to hear the tragic news that one of our Year 11 students has died.

'Ashli was an absolutely delightful, caring and mature young lady.

'She was working hard at school and was very well regarded and respected by staff and students alike.

'The school is pulling together as a community and supporting each other.

'Our thoughts and prayers go out to Ashli's family at this most difficult time.'
