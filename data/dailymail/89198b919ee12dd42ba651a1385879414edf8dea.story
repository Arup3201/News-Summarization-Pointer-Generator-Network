Spring was finally in the air in Britain today and the Queen aptly reflected the change of season in her choice of outfit for the annual Observance of Commonwealth Day service.

Her Majesty was pretty in pink as she arrived at Westminster Abbey this afternoon with the Duke of Edinburgh.

The Queen smiled and waved to the crowds before meeting religious dignitaries, choir boys and school children who handed her a bunch of flowers.

Blooming: The Queen arrived at Westminster Abbey in a pretty pink ensemble

All smiles: The Queen arrived with the Duke of Edinburgh

For you: A school girl hands Her Majesty some flowers

Rosy: A bouquet of flowers she was handed matched the one in her hat

Wearing a pink dress with matching coat, the Queen had fully colour co-ordinated her outfit down to her hat which was adorned with a large pink rose.

She also wore pearl earrings and a necklace. And she wasn't the only one. The Duchess of Cornwall teamed her cream ensemble with pearl earrings and a necklace that were remarkable similar to her mother-in-laws.

Double take: The Duchess of Cornwall, left, and Countess of Wessex both wore cream outfits with matching clutch and shoes and eye-catching hats

Elaborate: Sophie's bespoke hat was designed by milliner Jane Taylor complete with lace, sequins and twirls

Not to be out-done, Camilla's hat also stood tall adorned with leaf shapes

But Camilla's jewellery wasn't as eye-catching as her choice of head wear. She wore a side hat embellished with leaf shapes that rose above her head by at least an inch.

She arrived her husband the Prince of Wales who had opted for a royal blue suit and tie.

The Earl of Wessex, who celebrated his 50th birthday today, was also among the royal party and was joined by his wife the Countess of Wessex.

Like Camilla, she also wore a neutral outfit of a cream skirt suit with a striking bespoke hat designed by milliner Jane Taylor.

In fashion: The three royals all wore similar style pearl earrings

Birthday boy: Prince Edward went for a pin stripe suit

One quick change: Earlier Sophie had worn a white Alexander McQueen jacket and the same LK Bennett nude Sledge heels favoured by the Duchess of Cambridge while the prince wore the same suit and tie

The outfit was Sophie's second of the
 day as earlier she had visited
 Robert Browning Primary School in Walworth, south east London, dressed 
in a white Alexander McQueen jacket and the same LK Bennett nude Sledge 
heels favoured by the Duchess of Cambridge.

Before the Commonwealth service began the Queen unfurled a banner outside the Abbey's great west door.

In the Abbey a recording of the Queen's Commonwealth Day message was played for the congregation in which she praised the family of nations as a "powerful influence of good for the future".

Sporting heroes: Sebastian Coe and Tanni Grey Thompson meet the Queen

She stressed that experiences across the Commonwealth may be different but everyone was focused on the same goals.

In her message the Queen highlighted this year's Commonwealth theme - Team Commonwealth - and how nations understood they could achieve more by working together.

The congregation also heard personal testimonies, including one from Lord Coe, Olympic gold medallist and a former middle distance runner:

He said that the word Commonwealth took his mind to sport and he highlighted the Commonwealth Games being staged in Glasgow in the summer, traditionally known as the "friendly games".
