Charged: Dorice 'Dee Dee' Moore is accused of befriending and then murdering lottery winner Abraham Shakespeare

A woman accused of befriending a $30million lottery winner, swindling him of his cash and killing him began her trial for murder today.

Dorice 'Dee Dee' Moore, 40, allegedly became close to Florida lottery winner Abraham Shakespeare by claiming she was writing a book about him.

His body was found under a concrete slab behind a home detectives say was owned by Moore's ex-boyfriend in Hillsborough County.

He had been shot twice.

Moore is accused of killing Shakespeare, of Polk County, in April 2009. He won a $30million lottery jackpot in 2006.

Hillsborough Sheriff David Gee alleges she tried to dodge suspicion by using Shakespeare's phone to send family members text messages saying he was OK and also writing letters pretending to be him, according to 10 News.

Moore denies the murder and says she took over Shakespeare's assets, about $3.5million and a mansion, authorities say, so he could get away from people pestering him for money.

'The money was like a curse to him. And 
now it's become a curse to me,' Moore told reporters in 2010. 'God knows
I would never take another human being's life.'

But investigators claim Moore turned to a man called Greg Smith to cover up the crime.

He was already signed up as a sheriff's informant and was working with detectives to get close to her and gather information.

Sheriff Gee allege Moore trusted Greg
Smith so much that she asked him for help to find a prisoner willing to
take the blame for killing Shakespeare in exchange for $50,000.

The trial is expected to last two weeks. A pool of 100 prospective jurors was screened yesterday.

10
News reported that more than half raised their hand when asked if they 
were familiar with the case and will now each have to be quizzed on the 
extent of their knowledge of the case.

After his win Shakespeare, a 43-year-old truck driver, won a court challenge from a fellow trucker who accused him of snatching the winning ticket out of his wallet while the two were delivering meat to Miami restaurants.

Shakespeare's family reported him missing in November 2009, telling the Polk County sheriff's office they hadn't seen him since April.

Speaking at the time, Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd said when their investigation began they had hoped to find Shakespeare alive.

When the body was found, his brother Robert Brown was quoted by 10 News as saying: 'I'm missing my little brother, what ain't gonna be back no more.

'Dead and gone, and everything. He ain't coming back.'
