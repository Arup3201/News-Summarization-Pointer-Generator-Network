More people would vote to stay in the European Union than exit for the first time since David Cameron became Prime Minister.

Downing Street today announced Mr Cameron will deliver his long-awaited and much-trailed speech on Britain’s’ EU membership on Wednesday. He is expected to promise a referendum on severing ties with Brussels.

As the debate about Europe rages, a new opinion poll shows that the number of voters who want to remain part of the EU has suddenly overtaken those calling for withdrawal.

In-out question: For the first time since David Cameron became PM more people would vote to stay in the EU than leave, according to a series of opinion polls by YouGov

In the latest YouGov survey, people were asked how they would vote if there was a referendum on Britain's membership of the European Union.

Forty per cent of people said they would vote to remain while 34 per cent would vote to leave, according to the poll carried out on January 17 and 18.

It is a dramatic reversal of opinion since November last year when 51 per cent said they would back withdrawal while just 30 per cent wanted to stay in.

The shift in public attitudes to Brussels comes after months of speculation about Mr Cameron’s long-awaited speech on how he wants to claw back powers to London.

It suggests the widespread public debate has focused the minds of voters on the merits of remaining in the EU.

Labour's lead over the Conservatives has been slashed to just five points, according to an ICM poll released today.

The survey for The Guardian put Ed Miliband's party on 38 per cent (down two points since a similar poll last month), David Cameron's Tories on 33 per cent (up one), with Nick Clegg's Liberal Democrats on 15 per cent (up two) and the UK Independence Party on 6 per cent (down one).

Labour's advantage is the narrowest recorded by ICM since August last year, and follows a period in which the party has consistently racked up double-digit leads over the Conservatives.

It is likely to spark speculation that Mr Cameron's standing has been boosted by his handling of the crises in Algeria and Mali and by reports he is planning to offer an in/out referendum on future British membership of the European Union.

(ICM Research interviewed 1,001 adults between January 18 and 20.)

YouGov's Peter Kellner said: 'As 
always with sharp movements in public attitudes, we shall not know for 
some time whether we are seeing a blip or a trend.

'Britain
and the EU has been the top domestic political news story for the past 
fortnight. Maybe, when it recedes from the headlines, views about the EU
will revert to their normal "peacetime" default position in which the 
centre of gravity lies somewhere between scepticism and hostility.'

Last
week a separate YouGov survey showed half of people would vote to stay 
in the European Union if Mr Cameron succeeds in negotiating a new 
relationship, repatriating powers to Westminster.

He had been due to deliver the speech 
in Amsterdam on Friday but it was called off at the last moment as the 
PM reacted to the Algeria hostage crisis.

He will instead deliver it in central London on Wednesday morning. However,
extracts released in advance showed how he will use the speech to warn 
EU leaders that Britain could leave the 27-nation bloc if three key 
concerns are not resolved.

And
there is growing speculation that he will announce an in/out referendum
to be held after the 2015 general election, but rule out legislation 
during this parliament.

Mr 
Cameron today briefly met Estonian Prime Minister Andrus Ansip in 
Downing Street, and was expected to brief him on the contents of the 
speech.

He has already 
spoken to European leaders including Germany’s Angela Merkel, French 
President Francois Hollande and Dutch PM Mark Rutte.

When
Mr Cameron outlined his plans to Barack Obama on Thursday night the US 
President warned Britain must remain part of a 'strong European Union'.

The
US President used a call to London to stress the EU's role in spreading
'peace, prosperity, and security' around the world. Downing Street was 
forced to deny a rift, insisting the call was 'friendly'.

The survey will be a welcome boost to Mr Cameron on the eve of his speech when he is expected to promise voters a say on continuing to remain part of the EU

Mr Cameron will use his speech to warn that Britain could ‘drift towards the exit’ from the EU unless there is real change in Brussels.

He identified the crisis in the eurozone, the challenge of economic competitiveness and the issue of democratic legitimacy as key issues which must be resolved in negotiations on the future shape of the EU.

Asked why Mr Cameron would now be delivering his speech in London, his spokesman said: ‘We were planning to give it in Amsterdam. Unfortunately, that didn't prove possible and Wednesday morning in London fits better with the Prime Minister's schedule.’

The spokesman added: ‘There is a debate going on across the EU. There is also an active debate going on here in the UK. The Prime Minister's speech will be reflecting both those aspects.’

Communities Secretary Eric Pickles said today he had seen Mr Cameron's speech and was ‘very happy’ with its content.

Asked whether the Prime Minister could quell unrest over Europe among his backbenchers, Mr Pickles said: ‘I think so. I think there is a willingness and a desire to come together.’

Earlier this month, Mr Pickles said he hoped Britain could remain a member of the EU, but suggested it should not do so ‘at any price’.

Former defence secretary Liam Fox, a leading Tory Eurosceptic, said yesterday that he was ‘broadly satisfied’ with what he has been told.

‘If that is the speech that is finally delivered, a great many of us will think that it's a speech that we've been waiting a long time for any prime minister to deliver.’

Labour's Douglas Alexander, the shadow foreign secretary, said: We understand and support the Prime Minister’s decision to cancel his speech on Friday because of unfolding events in Algeria.

'The truth is the reason this speech has now been delayed for over 6 months is because David Cameron simply doesn’t know what to say.

'The gap between what his backbenchers demand and what the country needs has literally left him speechless, stranded between national and party interest.'

David Cameron said it was vital 
Britain never forgets the events of the Holocaust as he signed a 
memorial book to commemorate the lives of those killed in the genocide.

The
Prime Minister met Auschwitz survivor Freda Wineman, 89, who said 
future generations should continue to honour those who died at the hands
of the Nazis.

Mrs Wineman, from Lyon in France, has 
previously spoken of how she was separated from her mother for the final
time by Dr Josef Mengele, dubbed the Butcher of Auschwitz.

Mr Cameron wrote: 'We commemorate the lives lost in the European Holocaust and think also of those killed more recently in Rwanda, Cambodia, Darfur and Bosnia.'

Today, Mr Cameron said: 'It must be very harrowing to bring all those memories back.'

Mrs Wineman replied: 'It is very necessary. We must remember and we must never forget what happened.'

They were joined in Downing Street by representatives of the Holocaust Educational Trust, which works to raise understanding of the atrocity.

In a note to the Trust at the front of the memorial book, Mr Cameron wrote: 'Your work is absolutely vital in making sure that we always remember what happened in the Holocaust - and that we never stop learning the lessons.

'We commemorate the lives lost in the European Holocaust and think also of those killed more recently in Rwanda, Cambodia, Darfur and Bosnia.

'The tragedy is that so many did suffer from persecution and prejudice, but your work will make sure we never give up this fight and build a better world.'
