Lost and afraid, wandering aimlessly through nine miles of trails and hitting any one of 400 dead ends, the 911 calls of the baffled people stuck inside the world's largest corn maze have been released.

Numerous times over the past six months, the Solano County Sheriff's Office has had to respond to calls from frantic visitors to the Cool Patch Pumpkins in Dixon, California, mostly in the dark to rescue people from the 60-acre maze.

Indeed, the number of those getting lost inside the maze became so bad that the owners announced they would reduce the size next year to stop it swallowing paying customers whole.

Lost and scared: Worried visitors call 911 after getting caught in the The Cool Patch Pumpkins corn maze in California that spans a whopping 63 acres 

'I don't know what to do anymore. We've been in here like four hours,' one desperate caller says down the phone to the dispatcher.

While another woman tells 911 that she has been inside the Cool Patch Pumpkins for hours with her two kids and would appreciate leaving.

Another caller rang 911 and told them that he was concerned the maze would close and leave him overnight inside.

'We're stuck and they close at 10,' he said in a 911 call according to ABC News. 'We're very worried and we can't find a way out.'

Deputy Daryl Snedeker of the Solano County Sheriff's Office said that he gets these calls every year.

'We have a good working relationship with the owner of the corn maze, so our dispatch finds him and he goes out and finds them,' said Snedeker.

The Cool Patch Pumpkins corn maze in Dixon, near Sacramento California spanned 63 acres this year, 20 more acres than last year. They've even been named largest corn maze in the Guinness Book of World records.

Open late: The maze stayed open until 8pm and frightened navigators of the maze made calls to the Solano County Sheriff's Department after sunset

The maze stayed open until 8pm, and NBC reports that frightened navigators of the maze made calls to the Solano County Sheriff's Department after sunset.

Over the month that the maze was open, we got maybe seven calls, and in only three of those cases did the people actually call 911,' an officer told SF Gate.

'We tell them to relax and we put a call into the owner rather than send out a deputy.'

Matt Cooley who has been running the maze for over 12 years and said that the 911 calls might be a sign that the labyrinth has become too large for people to explore.

'My brother, who designs the maze, always wants to make it bigger and better,' he said.

'But we might scale it back a little next year.'

Despite the fact that maze explorers have been calling 911, this year has been quieter than others.

In previous years people have passed out in the middle of the maze.

'In past years we’ve had people who have passed out in there,' he said.

'Nothing like that this year though — just a bunch of people who have gotten confused and called 911,' Cooley added.

Cooley also told SF Gate that visitors are instructed not to call 911 but despite being warned, someone always gets frightened in the middle of the maze and makes the call.

'Sometimes you just know people will get out anyway so you let them figure it out, and sometimes we’ll get their number and talk them directly,' Cooley said.

'We’ve got guys who can navigate that thing in the dark,' Cooley added.

'So as a last resort, we’ll send in one of them to show them the way.'
