A British soldier has been killed in an explosion in Helmand, Afghanistan, on the same day Ed Miliband visited the area.

The soldier is the 415th member of UK forces to die since operations began in Afghanistan in October 2001.

He was from the 1st Battalion, The Royal Welsh.

His death coincided with the Labour leader's visit to the area where he called for new laws to prevent discrimination of soldiers upon their return to Britain.

Speaking about the treatment of returning soldiers Mr Miliband said: ‘I think it is wrong that any of our troops face discrimination, disadvantage or unfair treatment because they have served in the military or because they are serving.

He added that the international community desperately need to ‘up its game’ on political progress in Afghanistan – or risk wasting a decade of sacrifice by British soldiers.

The died in a blast on Saturday when the vehicle he was travelling in was struck by an improvised explosive device.

He has not yet been named although his next of kin have been informed.

This improvised explosive device was discovered by Afghan National Army soldiers in Afghanistan's Zabul province

He was on mobile patrol in the Nahr-e Saraj region of Helmand Province, and the attack which resulted in his death was carried out on the same day that Ed Miliband and Shadow Defence Secretary Jim Murphy visited a memorial to fallen British troops.

Spokesman for Task Force Helmand, Major Ian Lawrence, said: "It is with great sadness I must inform you that a soldier from 1st Battalion, The Royal Welsh has died of wounds sustained in an IED (Improvised Explosive Device) strike while on a mobile patrol in the Nahr-e Saraj District of Helmand Province.

'The thoughts and prayers of all in the Task Force are with his family and friends at this sad time.

'The soldier's next of kin have been informed.'

Figures for returning military personnel are bleak. More than a quarter are refused a mortgage, loan, credit card or mobile phone despite having a full-time job with a reliable income.

Speaking at the British Embassy ahead of his talk with president Hamid Karzai Ed Miliband said: ‘'I think the best way we can honour the sacrifices our troops have been making is to make sure that they have the best support when they come back

He continued: 'In this final phase it is very important that we don't take our eye off the ball. I do not think the Government is, I am not criticising the Government.

'The Prime Minister is right to set a timetable. I think we should stick to the timetable.

'We have invested a lot. Many of our troops have made huge sacrifices, including the ultimate sacrifice. The best way we can honour that is to ensure the political settlement we need.'
