Few images can beat those of Earth from space, which can display its magnificent vortices, stunning colours and abstract patterns in a way we rarely see.

But its beauty can also highlight some of the world’s problems including pollution, desertification, urban sprawl, farming and natural disasters.

In this series of images, Paris-based environmental activist Yann Arthus-Bertrand aims to explore some of the world’s biggest environmental and sociological challenges using satellite imagery.

These rows of oppositely spinning vortices, caused by the unsteady separation of flow of a fluid around blunt bodies, can be seen over the United States, Alaska, Aleutian Islands. This phenomena is known as Kármán Vortex Street

Compiled as part of his book, Earth from Space, Mr Arthus-Bertrand probes scientists and activists on how satellites can draw attention to some of these problems.

Among the images is one of the Mississippi delta that is notable for its stunning red and blue patterns.

But beneath its beauty the satellite picture reveals the devastation the Deepwater Horizon oil rig caused in April 2010.

An explosion on the semi-submersible drilling unit killed 11 workers and injured 16 others. It caused the Deepwater Horizon to burn and sink, resulting in a massive offshore oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico.

Bombetoka Bay, the Betsiboka River's sludgy estuary, reached six miles on Madagascar's west coast. Islands stretch out in the direction of the current and are covered by mangrove trees, seen in red in this image. In the surrounding area, the cleared forest gives way to brush and cassava and rice plantations

The image was released months after the explosion of the Deepwater Horizon oil rig. Oil slicks increase reflection on the surface and therefore appear as brighter white. 

It reveals the extent to which hydrocarbon pollution penetrated the delta's marshlands, which are so rich in biodiversity.

Mr Arthus-Bertrand, who is also an environmental activist, arranged the scenes pictured in his book into themes including pollution, desertification, urban sprawl, farming and natural disasters.

Grid patterns of fields and pastures surround the whirlpools created by the Mississippi, the largest hydrographic basin in North America. A number of oxbow lakes are shown as the river moves south of Memphis, Tennessee

The Ebro is Spain's most powerful river. Stretching for more than 550 miles (900 km), it flows into the Mediterranean through a vast delta that juts far into the sea. Abundant alluvium and an ingenious system of irrigation channels favour rice plantations, notably the famous bomba rice

The Lena River flows north for over 2,800 miles (4,500 km) through Russian Siberia to the Arctic Ocean. As the Lena enters the ocean, it divides into many channels and forms a large delta. The Landsat 7 satellite took this image in July 2000

Impressive phytoplankton blooms are also seen from space off Sweden’s Gotland Island.

Most Phytoplankton are too small to be individually seen with the unaided eye. However, when present in high enough numbers, they may appear as a green discoloration of the water.

Phytoplankton plays an important role in the ocean's carbon cycle by removing half of all CO2 from the atmosphere during photosynthesis and storing it deep under the sea.

Recent research has revealed that water temperature has a direct impact on maintaining the delicate plankton ecosystem of our oceans.

The new research means that ocean warming will impact plankton, and in turn drive the cycle of climate change.

Other images include that of the Ebro, Spain's most powerful river, the Senegal River dividing Senegal and Mauritania, and the urban sprawl of Detroit.

Mr Arthus-Bertrand also recently directed two films for the United Nations: the film Forest, official film of the 2011 International Year of the Forest, and the film Desertification. Both were screened during UN General Assemblies.

The Senegal River is a 1,790 km (1,110 mile) long river in West Africa that forms the border between Senegal and Mauritania. In the Early Middle Ages (c. 800 CE), the Senegal River restored contact with the Mediterranean world with the establishment of the Trans-Saharan trade route

Detroit, the 'automobile capital of the world,' lies west of Lake Saint Clair and the Detroit River

These impressive phytoplankton blooms as seen from space are shown off Sweden's Gotland Island. Most phytoplankton are too small to be individually seen with the unaided eye. However, when present in high enough numbers, they may appear as a green discoloration of the water

Lützow-Holm Bay is a large bay, about 120 miles wide, indenting the coast of Queen Maud Land in Antarctica. It was discovered by Captain Hjalmar Riiser-Larsen in two airplane flights from his expedition vessel, the Norvegia, in 1931
