Bank manager: Maria Rodriguez of Mount Kisco has pleaded guilty to systematically stealing over $1.4 million from two customers in suburban New York

Maria Rodriguez of Mount Kisco entered guilty pleas Monday, Westchester County District Attorney Janet DiFiore said in a news release.

46-year-old Rodriguez was a branch manager for M&T Bank in Ossining.

Rodgriuez pleaded guilty to one count of third-degree criminal tax fraud, as well as one count of first-degree grand larceny and one count of second-degree grand larceny, DiFiore said.

The district attorney said in the release 'We entrust our money and investments to our financial institutions and their employees. Both victims put their trust as well as their money in the hands of someone who they had faith in, but ultimately took advantage of that trust and stole from them.'

Several of Rodriguez's subordinates called the bank's whistleblower hotline. The bank contacted authorities.

DiFiore said the thefts began in June 2008.

The first victim 'trusted the defendant to assist her with her personal banking and banking for her business,' the news release said. 'Over the course of five years, the defendant stole money from the victim by writing unauthorized checks to cash, making unauthorized cash withdrawals, and requesting an ATM card and making unauthorized ATM withdrawals.'

The first victim had $1,112,127.40 stolen from her, DiFiore said.

The 92-year-old victim used to a be a police officer in Ossining Village, according to DiFiore, and reportedly lost $256,644.

DiFiore said in the release that the man thought he was withdrawing interest alone from his bank account. Rodriguez was instead making unauthorized withdrawals, she said.

Rodriguez faces up to 25 years in prison when she's sentenced on May 20.
