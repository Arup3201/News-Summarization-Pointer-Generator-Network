When Adrian Bayford said he'd carry on working after pocketing £148million on the lottery, you probably had a wry smile on your face.

But true to his word, here he is at the music shop he runs, grafting away as normal.

Mr Bayford, 41, who built the Suffolk Music Centre from a market stall, is regularly seen manning the till and doing odd jobs. And it's not uncommon to see him up early to open up the premises of the store he runs with business partner Richard Hudspith.

Shoppers saw the big-hearted family-man - officially the 516th richest person in Britain after his win - moving stock, collapsing boxes, and chatting with his regulars.

He was even up before the rush on Friday morning to open up the store he runs with Richard Hudspith just after 8.30am.

Adrian and his wife Gillian celebrate winning their huge win in August this year. Despite their vast fortune they have stayed remarkably down to earth living in the same house and splashing out on a modest Ford car

Chatting with the locals: Mr Bayford enjoys a spot of banter with a passer-by

He was spotted popping out for a 
snack and enjoying friendly banter with locals before dutifully heading 
back behind the counter - just like any other worker on the high street.

A close friend said: 'Adrian drifts 
in and out of the shop but is still working behind the counter - it is 
his business too after all.'

One shopper said: 'When I was in there he was carrying boxes and breaking boxes down.

'He was behind the counter it just seemed perfectly normal, he's obviously such a nice guy.

'There were a couple of local kids in there. They seemed to be chewing the fat.

'They've got a couple of couches in there. It's a really laid back atmosphere.

'The shop seemed quite busy. Whether that's because they want to buy a guitar, or because they want to look at the lottery millionaire - I don't know.

'They all certainly seemed to be interested in guitars.

'He seemed to be having a good laugh with his pal. It was really nice to see him enjoy work because, let's face it, he doesn't have to.

You can see why he has gone back.'

Adrian and wife Gillian, 40, scooped the second largest lottery jackpot in British history in August with a ticket Adrian bought at his local newsagents.

The first evidence of the start of their spending spree was spotted this week in the shape of a modest Ford family car.

The Bayfords have so far stunned Britain with the warm, laid back approach to super wealth and appeared to have continued the modest trend by opting for a £17,000 4x4 Kuga.

The sensible buy is a far cry from the dream car Gillian admitted to craving when she discovered the win - a £60,000 Audi Q7.

Millions of admirers were surprised to hear the Bayfords celebrated their fortune by having takeaway pizzas from Dominos.

Next they shunned exclusive resorts and the tropics by jetting off for a caravaning holiday with Gillian's parents in Scotland.

Gillian has worked in ward D2 at Addenbrooke's for three years but said she intended to leave the job to spend more time with her family.

The couple are still living in the same four bedroom, detached house, they owned before the win with children Cameron, four, and Aimee, six.

According to The Sunday Times Rich List, the Bayfords now have a fortune to rival Jamie and Jools Oliver (£150m), Sir Tom Jones (£140m) and Eric Clapton (£130m).

Their win shot them to 516th in the Sunday Times Rich List.
