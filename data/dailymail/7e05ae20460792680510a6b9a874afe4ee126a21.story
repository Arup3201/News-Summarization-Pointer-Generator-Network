A retired welder has described how he came within hours of an agonising death after contracting all three deadly forms of bubonic plague from a cat bite.

Paul Gaylord, 61, relived in vivid detail how the horrifying symptoms of the Black Death began to take over his body - gradually turning his hands black. 

Mr Gaylord, who lives in a remote part of Oregon, 12 miles from the small town of Prineville, spent nearly a month attached to a life support machine as his body battled to fight the deadly illness.

The plague began to consume his vital organs - causing his long to collapse and his heart stop beating.

Doctors had discussed switching off his life support machine the day before woke from his coma, he said as he revealed how close to death he had come.

Now on the mend following the infection, he told the Guardian about the moments after he was rushed to hospital.

He said: 'Hooked up to a dialysis machine, I had collapsed lungs and at one point my heart stopped... Technically, I shouldn't be here.'

'My doctor told me I had developed all 
three stages of the plague: bubonic (the least lethal form, which 
infects the lymphatic system), pneumonic (which infects the lungs) and 
septicaemic (the bloodstream). Some people have survived bubonic plague,
 but not all three, apparently.'

Horrifying: Mr Gaylord's symptoms included his hands and feet swelling up and turning black as the infection killed his flesh

Gaylord was infected in June, 2013, 
when he tried to remove a mouse from the throat of a choking cat.

The 
plague-stricken animal bit him. Within 48 hours he began to suffer flu-like symptoms. Soon his skin started to turn grey and the glands under his arms swell to the size of lemons.

Recent research suggests that the bubonic plague is on the increase in affluent communities in the U.S..

It used to be associated with squalor, unsanitary conditions and rodent infestations.

But as more people move to natural environments where carriers such as ground squirrels and woodrats live, infection increases

The disease is caused by the bacteria Yersinia pestis that is spread through flea bites.

About 11 cases of plague a year have occurred in the U.S. since 1976.

17 people have been infected by the disease in Oregon since 1934.

Mr Gaylord is still coming to terms with how serious his illness was and how miraculous his recovery has been.

Told
 he faced a life of dialysis because his vital organs were too badly 
damaged, Mr Gaylord underwent one treatment before his body regained its
 functions. 

But it was too late to save his long-dead fingers, which surgeons have now amputated.

'I
 still have my hands and part of my thumbs. They took off all the toes 
on my left foot, and about a third of my right foot is gone', he added.

'It's
 hard to believe it happened to me, but rather than feel depressed, I've
 always felt positive and happy to be alive.'

Mr Gaylord retired as a welder and now spends much of his free time indulging in his hobby making knives in his garage.

Although the plague is generally connected to the Middle Ages, the woman is the 18th person sickened by the disease in Oregon since 1934.

A seven-year-old girl, Sierra Jane Downing, also contracted the disease while on a camping trip in Colorado this month.

Recovery: Paul Gaylord, 61, who lost all his fingers and toes and the top halves of his thumbs after contracting bubonic plague from a cat bite, works on making a knife at his home workshop near Prineville, Oregon

It is believed she caught it from a dead squirrel, who she had asked her parents if she could bury.

They said no, but she knelt beside it and doctors believe fleas could have jumped on to her sweater.

Days after they returned from the trip, her parents found her in the bathroom having a seizure.

She was rushed to hospital and treated with antibiotics once doctors realised what it was.

She will make a full recovery and has been released from hospital.

Without treatment the plague kills around two thirds of infected humans within four days. It causes an infection that kills cells, causing gangrene which also often results in amputation.

Symptoms of the plague in humans, which typically appear within four days, include fever, chills and a bloody or watery cough.

In animals, it presents itself with enlarged lymph nodes under the jaw, as well as fever and tiredness.

Research suggests that the bubonic plague, which used to be associated with squalor, is on the increase in affluent communities in the U.S.

As more people move to natural environments where ground squirrels and woodrats live, infection increases.

The disease, associated with the medieval period and made famous by historic etchings, similar to the one below of a London town crier in1665 calling for plague victims to be brought forward, is caused by the bacteria Yersinia pestis that is spread through flea bites.

Symptoms usually appear between two and five days after exposure to the bacteria.

They include gangrene of the extremities such as toes, fingers, lips and tip of the nose; fever; muscle cramps; seizures; lymph gland swelling.

Other potential symptoms include heavy breathing, continuous vomiting of blood, aching limbs and extreme pain, usually caused by the decay of the skin while the person is still alive.
