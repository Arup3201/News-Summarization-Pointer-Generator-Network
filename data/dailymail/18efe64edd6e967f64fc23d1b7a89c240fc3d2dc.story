When a media team devised a social experiment asking the Indian public to support their campaign to kill poor people, they expected much more of a backlash.

But far from being disgusted, they found that some were more than willing to support the cause after taking their bogus appeal far too literally.

Wearing a billboard declaring 'kill the poor', actor Nick Arya took to the streets of Connaught Place, a wealthy district of New Delhi, to gauge the public's reaction.

Testing the social divide: Indian actor Nick Arya wears a billboard saying 'kill the poor' as part of an experiment to gauge the public's reaction on the streets of Delhi to their spoof campaign

Getting on board: One member of the public tells Mr Arya that the 'poor are responsible for all the crime'

Insensitive reaction: The man then takes the campaign all too literally when he agrees to support Mr Arya in his bogus quest to kill the poor

In a video posted on YouTube created by YTV Network India, he is 
seen explaining their appeal to one man who readily agrees, adding: 
'Poor are responsible for all the crime.'

Two
 other men appear unmoved when Mr Arya details how they can donate to 
the fake organisation and then they would 'kill them (poor people).'

He
 also struggles to gain the attention of two police officers, who do no 
more than ask him politely to leave without taking any further action.

This was even after Mr Arya explained to them how the group would use poor people's body parts to their advantage.

Supportive: Another member of the public appears to side with the campaign by admitting the idea was 'really good', although it's not clear whether he was thought it was either a metaphor or tongue-in-cheek

Political statement: When Mr Arya explains to the man that he is trying to spread the message, he replies that 'Congress has been doing this for 40-60 years'

Naman
 Sharma, the CEO of media company U'th Time, which devised the 
experiment, told MailOnline: 'The purpose of this social experiment was 
to test whether citizens of India had genuine concern and care for the 
poor.

'We knew that people would react strongly if our actor became a human billboard asking people to "Kill The Poor".

'But to our surprise a lot of people didn't seem to be appalled by the idea of an organisation trying to kill the poor.

'Instead, some of them even agreed with us and gave us ideas to execute our social experiment.'

Nonplussed: Police officers listen in as Mr Arya explains how his fake group can use poor people's body parts

Told to move on: Police officers ask Mr Arya to leave the area, but take no other action over his campaign

People DO care: This man was among the few citizens who took issue with the experiment, swearing at Mr Arya and accusing of him of being 'mad'

Some do, however, take issue with Mr Arya, with one man swearing at him and calling him 'mad'.

Later
 in the video, he swaps his 'Kill The Poor' billboard for one saying 
'Help The Poor' while rattling a tin to test the public's reaction to a 
more positive appeal.

But the team found that only one person donated any money.

Mr
 Sharma said: 'We were in for a big surprise when people reacted 
insensitively to killing the poor and didn't even donate when we asked 
them to help the poor.

Role reversal: Later in the video, Nick swaps his 'Kill The Poor' billboard for one saying 'Help The Poor' while rattling a tin to test the public's reaction to a more positive appeal

'Hypocritical of the public': The team found that only this man donated any money to the 'Help The Poor' appeal

'This was, in a way, extremely hypocritical of the general public of our nation.'

The campaign was similar to that carried out by a charity on the streets of London last month.

It
 featured a member of the The Pilion Trust, which helps the most 
vulnerable in society, wearing a sandwich saying: 'F*** the poor'.

The charity found that while Londoners did care about the plight of the poor, they weren't likely to stop to help.
