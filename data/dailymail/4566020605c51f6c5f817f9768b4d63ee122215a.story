A schoolgirl who sparked an outcry over nutrition by posting pictures of her school food online has been inundated with pictures of school dinners from around the world - and has chalked up a million hits.

Nine-year-old Martha Payne started posting photographs of the pathetic plates of food she was offered at school and rated them as part of a writing project she and her father started.

It sparked a media storm and over the past few weeks her blog NeverSeconds  has attracted a million hits, while children from America to Taiwan, Japan and Spain have emailed shots of the food they have to endure.

Writing on her blog, Martha said: 'Whilst I was having my tea my blog went through 1 million hits! 'When I started writing this I thought only my family and friends would see it so it's amazing so many people have visited and you all care about school food.'

Pupil's from the 4th grade class at Arlington Elementary School in Spokane, Washington, U.S. were among the youngsters who sent a photo of their very healthy lunch.

They wrote: 'We had a crunchy salad consisting of lettuce, cabbage, turkey, ham, cheese, tomato, cucumbers, radishes and carrots.

Colourful: Kimberley from Glenview School, near Chicago, Illinois, U.S. sent in this picture of her school dinner of spaghetti bolognese, fruit and plenty of vegetables. Martha thought it looked tasty

Healthy: A school meal from Yokohama, Japan which includes rice, pickled daikon radish and sour plum and steamed sliced okra. It was rated 8/10 by the pupil although Martha didn't recognise many of the foods

'On the side we were able to have peaches, kiwi, cauliflower and pickles. We have milk everyday - your choice of chocolate, strawberry or white (which is boring). For desert we were given fruit snacks.

'The vegetables were crispy and full of juice.'

Meanwhile, Jamie, from Yokohama, Japan, sent a picture of his dinner which he rated 8/10 for taste and healthiness.

It included pickled daikon radish and sour plum, steamed sliced okra, green beans, carrots and garlic, white fish wrapped in a leaf and steamed as well as vegetable and egg cooked with a soy glaze and a container of white rice.

Pol Elia from Spain sent in a picture of her vegetable stew, which she rated 7/10 while Kimberley from a school in Chicago sent in her lunch of spaghetti bolognese with vegetables and fruit.

Average: Martha's latest school dinner which she ate yesterday included a sausage and bean pitta pocket - which she didn't order - and rated it 5/10

Meanwhile, Martha posted a picture of her latest school dinner but criticised the ordering system and rated it 5/10.

She said: 'I ordered an enchilada but I got a sausage and bean pitta pocket. My pineapple ring didn't even make it to the table, I ate it on the way!

'Inside the pitta bread are baked beans and mini sausages. It's quite difficult to eat because it all falls out as you pick it up!

'I'm not a fan of sweet milkshakes and mine today wasn't sweet, or chocolatey. The cupcakes today were all iced with strawberry icing and I liked that off first!'

Food for thought: Martha posted this picture on an internet blog and began to add daily snaps of her lunches, rating and commenting on them

Martha's miserable school dinners look set to spark an outcry over nutrition for the nation's children

Martha's blog has even proved popular with school dinners campaigner Jamie Oliver who sent her a signed copy of his book encouraging her to keep up the good work.

It all began a few weeks ago with a snap of ameasly meal she was given – a slice of pizza and a potato croquette, alongside a sprinkling of sweetcorn, a cupcake for dessert and a lot of empty space.

When she first checked her  website for reaction, it boasted only three hits.

Because Martha’s home is on the west coast of Scotland, however, standards for school meals differ and widespread improvements in the rest of Britain appear not to have been applied.

But Martha’s fearless exposé of daily fare at her (unnamed) school prompted global discussion about shockingly unhealthy food being served.

One nutritionist branded the lunches ‘scary’. Another praised her for ‘speaking out’.

Martha, whose mother Rebecca is a GP, began the blog because she is interested in writing. 

With permission from teachers, she photographed her £2 lunches and wrote about them.

Speaking about one school dinner on her blog: ‘The pizza in the first pic was alright but I’d have enjoyed more than one croquette. I’m a growing kid and I need to concentrate all afternoon and I cant do it on one croquette. Do any of you think you could?’

Martha's NeverSeconds blog has chalked up a million hits. She is supervised by her father David (left)

She awards it six out of ten on the ‘Food-o-meter’ but it scores only four for health.

And later she wrote: ‘Today’s meal was on the menu as cheeseburger and ice cream/biscuit but as you can see I got an ice lolly. I prefer ice cream. I wish they had stuck to the menu.’

Her father Dave, who manages a smallholding at home, said: ‘It really seems to have touched a nerve. I joked that it would probably go viral. I really didn’t believe it would.’
