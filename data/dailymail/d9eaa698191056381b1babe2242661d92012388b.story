A family in Illinois have created their very own ice kingdom modeled after Disney's Frozen - with a 45-foot-tall icicle being the piece de resistance.

Katherine Ragel, 56, from St. Elmo recruited her son, Garrick Moreland, to help make the giant structure.

The arbor man climbed into a tree in minus degree weather with a hose and turned on the water. It took eight days for the icicle to reach the ground.

The mother-son duo completed their winter wonderland with a mannequin of Princess Esla.

They also dotted other characters from Frozen around the front yard including Anna, Kristoff, and the Olaf the snowman. 

Despite being proud of her display, Ragel is worried here might be an accident because passing traffic sometimes stops in the 'middle of the road' to catch a glimpse of it.

'People honk and wave,' she told The Effingham Daily News.

Ragel's idea for the giant icicle originally came from her late husband, Alan, who liked to build smaller ones along the driveway.

Head-turner: The widow recruited her son, Garrick Moreland, to help make the giant icicle which is also decked out with night lights

He did attempt making one before his death in 2012 but it only grew to only about 30 feet.

Ragel posted an image of her son's new 45-foot sculpture to Facebook this week.

She wrote in the caption field: 'Hopefully weather lets it stay a while. 

'I enjoy seeing little kids faces plastered against the windows as they drive by.'

She and her son are now working on adding the Frozen theme music after wiring up night lights.
