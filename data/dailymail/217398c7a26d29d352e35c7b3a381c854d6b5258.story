Andre Schurrle bolts in his chair, pupils dilated. The conversation has moved on to how much it really means to pull on a Germany shirt. ‘It’s the most important thing for us, without doubt,’ he says. ‘Look at the players who have pulled on that jersey throughout history. You are one of them.’

And so the Chelsea man recounts the names. Beckenbauer, Muller, Matthaus, even Ballack. ‘It means so much to me. When I was young I saw the national team with this pride and history.’

In the build-up to what should prove to be a World Cup to beat any of the previous three, the Germans know what they are and know exactly what they ought to achieve.

Joachim Low’s side are off to Brazil with the sole intention of becoming the first European side to win it in South America. Looking at the 23 they’re taking, it’s difficult to argue with Schurrle when he bluntly offers: ‘Our goal is the title – it must be with this team.’

Into the final four of the last three tournaments since Jurgen Klinsmann left eight years ago, the belief now is that it’s time to stop falling at the last.

There are, Schurrle divulges, compelling reasons why; key men including Philipp Lahm and Bastian Schweinsteiger have reached their peak, while the emergence of younger supplements makes Germany a very exciting prospect indeed.

‘The team is quite young,’ he adds. ‘We’ve got Mario Gotze, Marco Reus, myself… Thomas Muller is still young too.’

Focus immediately pins on Reus.  It hasn’t been difficult to see why Manchester United remain so desperate to add the Dortmund forward. The 24-year-old - who singlehandedly beat Real Madrid in a Champions League quarter-final second leg in April - has now added consistency in front of goal to his ingenuity on the ball, making him one of the most revered talents on the continent.

‘The way he played during the last few months for Dortmund was quite incredible - he scored or assisted every match. Technique, pace and that right foot – it’s fantastic. He’s a very intelligent footballer as well.

‘I know him well – Marco is one of my best friends in football.’

And with that Schurrle reveals just why the Germans are so dangerous, beyond their obvious charm in possession and doggedness without it. This team has grown up together. ‘It feels like a family,’ the 23-year-old says. ‘We’ve played together for the last four years. We’ve got big players of great quality and have two players for each position.

‘You build partnerships. You know what he wants on the pitch and how you should play a ball. That’s going to be an advantage for us.

‘Everybody sticks together and knows each other. It’s been a long time now and we’ve a good mix.’

Roy Hodgson’s defiant line that there’d be no point England travelling to Brazil not believing they could win it was admirable, but it’s questionable whether he himself really feels Steven Gerrard will be tootling up the Maracana steps to collect silverware. For Germany – with the undisputed talent at Low’s disposal – the time is now. Twenty-four years is too long.

That’s the message from above, driven by the silent patriarch Lahm and radiating down.

‘He isn’t the one to motivate everyone,’ Schurrle reasons. ‘Philipp is calm and has seen everything, even in the most difficult situation. He plays every game brilliantly, so easy, as if it’s nothing. He never makes mistakes – exactly what a captain needs to do. Everybody looks towards him.

‘He has his own ideas and knows what he’s talking about. If he talks to you it always makes sense.’

Talk then turns to Germany’s group: very tough on paper, and potentially more difficult in reality. Portugal are first up before Ghana and Klinsmann’s America.

Does the opening game set the tone for the tournament, particularly if Cristiano Ronaldo is kept quiet?

‘You can’t think like this,’ Schurrle replies. ‘We’ve two games to go after that. It’s important to remain calm. If you lose then you start thinking everything’s over already and it isn’t. It’s a difficult group, but we should win all three games.

‘I don’t 
think you can stop Ronaldo for the whole 90 minutes because of his 
individual class. We have the players of our own though. Philipp plays 
against him and knows him quite well after the games between Real Madrid
 and Bayern Munich.

‘Philipp
 is the best full back in the world. He can play in midfield, too, but 
for me if Ronaldo plays on the wing Lahm has to be there.’

How long left? Bastian Schweinsteiger could be playing in his last World Cup for Germany this summer

It appears he may have a point. Pep Guardiola opted to play his skipper at left-back against Madrid. Ronaldo up against David Alaba was on the other flank and took Bayern apart in the Allianz Arena, scoring twice to book their place in Saturday’s final against Atletico.

Recent painful memories for Lahm and Schweinsteiger could either inspire or cripple. Schurrle is left in no doubt which.

‘I think they’re even hungrier now because they want to win a big title,’ he claims. ‘I don’t know how many World Cups Philipp and Bastian are going to play in the future, so they want to win this.

‘It’s something they don’t have.’ Not yet at least. If any side are to break the South American stranglehold, it’s Germany.
