Pacifiers which feature a miniature moustache are being recalled over fears that babies could choke on them, while strollers being withdrawn because of concerns it could amputate fingers.

Britax is recalling approximately 216,000 B-Agile strollers after eight reports, including one partial fingertip amputation, one broken finger, and several severe lacerations.

Around 200,000 Fred & Friends pacifiers, which feature fake moustaches, volume controls, and panic buttons, are also being recalled after fears that the small parts could fall off and cause babies to choke.

There are also concerns that the breathing holes in the front of the pacifiers are too small. The majority, 187,000, were bought in the U.S., with the rest being sold in Canada.

While no injuries have so far been reported, the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission advised parents to stop using the products immediately.

The same advice is being given to owners of The B-Agile, B-Agile Double and BOB Motion single strollers.

Britax customers are being told that the injuries, which have all happened to adults, have occurred because of a hinge on the right hand side of the stroller which could become dangerous if the fold release button was being pressed and at the same time as pulling the fold release strap.

According to the Washington Post, Fred & Friends has received one report of the knob on the volume pacifier coming off.

At the same time the pacifiers are being recalled (left), owners of Britax's B-Agile strollers (right) are being given repair kits to fix a problem with a hinge which can cause amputations, broken fingers and lacerations

Consumers can return the pacifiers for a $12 refund by calling (855) 346-6372 or going online at fredandfriends.com.

Britax is offering consumers who bought its strollers from May 2011 to June 2013 a free repair kit by calling (866) 204-1665, or visiting www.britaxusa.com or www.bobgear.com.

Last June, Fred & Friends recalled nearly 57,000 baby rattles that also posed a choking risk.

Britax have enjoyed a surge in popularity after William and Kate were pictured carrying Prince George out of hospital this summer in one of their car seats.
