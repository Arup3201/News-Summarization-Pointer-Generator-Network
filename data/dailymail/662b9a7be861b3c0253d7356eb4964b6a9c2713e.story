An admin worker believes she has found the world's longest Hula Hoop after pulling a version of the snack measuring almost five inches from her bag of crisps.

Vicky Worrall, 26, from Runcorn, Cheshire, discovered the mammoth morsel when she picked up the bag of cheese and onion-flavoured Hula Hoops during her lunch break. 

Despite describing herself as a 'hopeless dieter', the mother-of-one was able to save the snack, and now plans to sell it on eBay to raise money for charity.

'I bought the crisps from the man with the sandwich van, because I'm hopeless at dieting and fancied a treat,' said Ms Worrall.

'I couldn't believe it when I opened the packet and found that whopper. I kept laughing - we all did - it's just funny.

'I've put it on eBay because I've been wanting to raise some money for charity for a while but didn't know what to do.'

Ms Worrall's crisp measures four and a half inches long, and she decided to sell it after learning that a three-inch version discovered by musician Stuart Hampton, 31, from Darnhill in Greater Manchester sold for £712 in October last year.

Ms Worrall now faces a battle to keep the crisp away from boyfriend Lee Schon, and her three-year-old daughter Kaiyla, in case one of them eats it.

'He thinks I'm going a bit mad, but also that it's hilarious,' Ms Worrall said of her partner.

'He keeps threatening to eat it - I would be so angry if he ate it.

'We only give Kaiyla crisps as a very rare, occasional, treat, but I know it would be gone in a flash if she got hold of it.

'Hula Hoops aren't even my favourite crisp, I just fancied a bag.

'Whoever would have thought crisps would be so funny?'

Ms Worrall, who found the crisp on Friday, is yet to decide which charity the money raise will go to, but the crisp has already attracted a bid of £30.

In the listing, she wrote: 'I have what I believe to be the world's longest hula hoop ( cheese & onion ), beating a previous eBay seller who's hula hoop was measuring in at 3' long.

'On measurement mine is a staggering 4 and a half inches. Please see pictures.

'Only serious bidders please. Happy Bidding!

'I will send via special delivery.'

There is currently no official longest Hula Hoop as such finds are not covered by any Guinness World Records record category.

However, a spokesman told MailOnline that the closest would be the record for the largest bag of potato chips which weighed 2,515lb 7.52oz, and was made by Corkers Crisps in Pymoor, Cambridgeshire, UK, on  September 13, 2013. 

Record categories involving large food only cover scaled-up versions of the items, which must be made in the same way as the ordinary sized versions, but on a grand scale.

'Guinness World Records does not monitor cases where people find unusually large versions of an item of manufactured food that has been made in a factory,' the spokesman said. 

'These aberrations are not uncommon and finding them does not involve the challenge of record-breaking.' 

KP Snacks, the Hula Hoop parent company, is yet to comment on the find.
