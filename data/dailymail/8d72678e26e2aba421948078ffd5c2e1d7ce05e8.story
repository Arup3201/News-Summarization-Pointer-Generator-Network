Investigators sifting through the wreckage of a Boeing 747-400 cargo plane that crashed in Afghanistan on April 29 have found that several of the straps used to tie down the 16-ton MRAP fighting vehicles broke after takeoff.

This has led to speculation that the massive armored vehicles shifted shortly after the civilian cargo plane took off from Bagram air base, sending it careering out of control.

Seven American crew members, all civilian employees of National Air Cargo, were killed in the crash. A passing motorist captured dramatic video of the plane plummeting to Earth on a dashboard camera.Â

Secured: A Boeing 747-400 like the model that crashed on April 29 in Afghanistan can carry five 16-ton MRAP armored vehicles tied down with chains and heavy nylon straps

Something's wrong: The plane, described as a cargo flight, then starts to twist and quickly

Crash: The Taliban claimed that it shot down the aircraft, a claim NATO denies

ABC News reports that crash investigators believe that some of the heavy-duty nylon straps holding the Oshkosh M-ATV MRAP vehicles in place aboard the plane snapped shortly after it took off.

If the heavy cargo shifted dramatically as the pilots tried to climb, the crew would have been helpless to control the aircraft, aviation experts told ABC.

The last words the pilots radioed out was 'weight.'

It is unknown how many of the vehicles the 747-400 was carrying, though the maximum load that model airliner can carry is five.

The Aviation Herald reported that the crew of the plane reported that a load shift caused the plane to stall moments before the crash.

The crewmen killed were: Pilots Brad Hasler of Trenton, Michigan, and Jeremy Lipka of Brooklyn, Michigan; first officers Jamie Brokaw of Monroe, Michigan, and
 Rinku Summan of Canton, Michigan; maintenance crewmen Gary Stockdale of 
Romulus, Michigan, and Timothy Garrett of Louisville, Kentucky; and loadmaster Michael Sheets of Ypsilanti, Michigan.

Casualties: All seven crewmembers aboard the cargo plane were killed in the crash

Explosion: The terrifying crash sent flames shooting into the sky

Hasler married his longtime 
girlfriend just two weeks before his death. The couple had a 2-year-old 
child and another on the way, his 
brother said.

The brother, Bill Hasler, told WDIV-TV: 'If I could trade places with him so that he could be with his family, I would in a heartbeat.'

In a statement to NBC News,
 Bill Hasler added: 'Brad was a wonderful father to two young children, a
 beloved husband to a wife who is expecting another child, a loving son,
 and the most loyal and supportive brother I could have ever asked for.

'His influence in the lives of all of us who loved him is immeasurable, and our grief is indescribable.'

The station reported that fellow crewmember Sheets was engaged, and was to get married later this year.

In
 a statement to WDIV, Mr Sheets' family said: 'While there were inherent
 risks involved in his position, Michael assumed these risks to provide 
for his family.

'Michael was a loving and devoted son and brother.'

It
 was revealed last night that Stockdale had predicted he would die in 
ball of flames, and believed that flying was a huge risk, his older 
brother said.

Heavy truck: The Oshkosh M-ATV MRAP (Mine Resistant Ambush Protected) vehicle was designed to offer troops more armor than Humvees

Tragic: Plane crash victim Michael Sheets was engaged to be married

Stockdale, 55, said: 'He always said it was dangerous,' NBC reported.

'He would always say, "You either will die in a car crash or a ball of flame in a plane".'

A horrifying dashcam video captured the Boeing 747-400 appearing to take off normally as it gained altitude.

But suddenly, the plane appears to stall, twisting and dropping rapidly before crashing to the ground in a fireball.

In a statement, the Taliban claimed responsibility for the crash, but NATO's International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) said there were no reports of insurgent activity in or around the base, which is one of the largest in the country and located about 25 miles north of Kabul.

National Airlines president, Glen 
Joerger, said in a statement: 'Safety is always our top priority at 
National Airlines. This is a devastating loss for our family and we'll 
work diligently with authorities to find the cause.

'Most importantly, our thoughts and prayers are with our crewmembers and their families.'

The
 Afghanistan Ministry of Transportation and Commercial Aviation is 
leading the investigation. The NTSB has also sent officials to assist in
 the probe.

One of Brokaw's friends described him as a skilled navigator with significant flight experience.

'He
 was a very good person and very smart person,' Chris Connerton told The
 Associated Press Tuesday by telephone from Rochester, Minnesota.

Connerton credited Brokaw with helping 
get him through flight school, as well as a harrowing flight two years 
ago from Toledo, Ohio, to an international flight expo in Lakeland, 
Florida, Connerton said ice had built up on the plane to the point that 
he could no longer get it to climb.

'If it wasn't for Jamie's navigation 
and know-how ... we wouldn't have made it,' Connerton said. 'I don't 
know that I would have had the capacity to handle the situation on my 
own.'

Brokaw leaves behind a wife and young step-daughter.

Gary Stockdale, 51, from Romulus, Michigan, was a member of the maintenance crew

Jeremy
 Lipka's stepfather Dave Buttman said that his stepson had toured Iraq 
and Afghanistan and escaped near-fatal incidents, but continued to serve
 his country.

He said: 
'Basically, you're taking your chances flying in there and he was just 
happy to be one of the pilots to do it,' NBC reported.

Hasler was a high school hockey star who lived in a tidy neighborhood in the suburbs outside Detroit.

The
 district governor for Bagram, Abdul Shukor, described the plane as 
having reached an altitude of about 1,312 feet before suddenly 'falling 
out of the sky,' he said, citing witness accounts.

Coalition forces said that the official cause of the crash is under investigation, but it is believed that the plane's cargo - which included mostly military vehicles - moved as the flight took off, causing it to spin out of control.

Bad weather is also being weighed as a possible cause.
