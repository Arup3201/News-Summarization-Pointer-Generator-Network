They say there is no place like home, but this cat might beg to disagree.

After disappearing shortly before the new year, Cookie was found 270 miles away from her owners' house living it up in a luxury hotel.

The feline somehow travelled from Skewen, near Swansea, South Wales, to Gomersal, West Yorkshire.

Owners Andrew and Samantha Buchanan and 
their two young daughters had given up hope of finding their pet after 
she went missing on December 29.

But while they were searching in vain, Cookie was lapping up gourmet meals at the Gomersal Park Hotel.

The cat turned up at the back door of the hotel where staff took pity on her and took her in.

One employee, Claire Brogden, took her to the vets and discovered that Cookie was chipped.

The Buchanans were contacted and drove to collect the cat, which is thought to have been accidentally driven there in the hotel’s laundry van.

Hotel spokesman Keith Joplin said: ‘We have our laundry cleaned in Cardiff, so she could have jumped in while they were loading the van, travelled all the way up north, and then leapt out again once it got to Gomersal.’

Mr Buchanan, 33, said: ‘We have been out looking for her every day, we weren't a complete family without her.

‘We had told the children, Lucy and Abigail, that Cookie was being looked after, but little did we know she was being looked after in a hotel in West Yorkshire.

‘On Wednesday we got a call from a vet to say Cookie had been found. I thought “brilliant” and then the vet said she was in West Yorkshire.

‘Abigail had told her teacher her cat had gone missing and she'd handed out flyers and posters all round town.’

He added: ‘On Friday the school has a “show and tell” and she's going to tell the big story of how she got her cat back.’

The Buchanans reported their cat missing on Gumtree before she was found thanks to an electronic chip
