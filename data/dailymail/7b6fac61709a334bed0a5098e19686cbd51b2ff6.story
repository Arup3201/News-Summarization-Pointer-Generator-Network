A model who has been linked to golf ace Rory McIlory has walked away from a motorway crash with barely more than a sore head after flipping her car eight times.

Nadia Forde, who was spotted on a night out with the Northern Irish sportsman earlier this month, has told friends she is ‘lucky to be alive’ after the horror smash on the M40 motorway, headed towards Birmingham from London.

The singer was taken to hospital with ‘bumps and bruises’ on Sunday when her car – a Fiat 500 – hit the central reservation during a heavy downpour.

Emergency services were called to the M40 London to Birmingham motorway just outside the capital, but the 25-year-old surprised medics by walking away from the crash virtually unscathed.

Miss Forde, who is launching a pop career, is believed to have been introduced to McIlory at a Dubai bar.

McIlroy and Danish tennis star Caroline Wozniacki ended their relationship in May. The Northern Irish golfer and his 23-year-old former fiancée were due to wed in November.

But McIlroy, 25, is said to have ended their three-year relationship in a 180 second phone call because he was not prepared for 'all that marriage entails'.

Miss Forde was discharged yesterday morning and was resting when contacted by the Irish Daily Mail.

According to her spokesman, Joanne Byrne: ‘She was so lucky. The car flipped seven or eight times. It is completely written off and the fact that she was able to walk away without any broken bones or serious injuries is nothing short of a miracle.

‘When she climbed out of the wreckage, the woman in the car behind her couldn’t believe that she had escaped. She was shaken up by the whole ordeal. She has a bump on the head and was taken to hospital to have it checked out but apart from that she seems okay.

‘She is thanking her guardian angel because she knows she is lucky to be alive.’

Miss Forde is in the UK to promote her debut pop single, BPM, in cities such as Cardiff and Newcastle, before she flies to Ibiza for a performance.

A British spokesman for the singer said: ‘Apart from a few minor bumps and bruises, Nadia is fine. She feels very lucky to be alive and to have escaped with such minor injuries and relieved that no one else was injured.’

In 2009, Miss Forde was had another lucky escape just a few months after her then boyfriend, FM104 DJ Mark Noble was involved in a serious smash.

She was left shaken but uninjured after her Peugeot skidded on a wet road near Dublin’s East Link toll bridge and smashed into the car in front of her.

Miss Forde has poured cold water on suggestions of a relationship, claiming she was ‘young, free and happily single’ despite being spotted leaving a Dublin nightclub with the Co.Down sportsman at 3am last month.

The FHM model admitted last week that she had met the golfer but insisted: ‘He doesn’t  even have my phone number and I don’t have his.’

She said: ‘I met Rory last year through friends. He’s a lovely guy. We have mutual friends who introduced us and we’ve been in each other’s company.

Asked if Rory was her type, she replied: ‘I don’t really have a type, to be honest. For me it’s not about looks. It’s about the person. I think whoever I end up with, I will be friends with first.

‘The important thing is having somebody with ambition and drive who is hard-working. That for me is a massive turn-on.’

Miss Forde said she was enjoying her promotional tour of Britain.

Speaking at the Irish premiere of Transformers: Age Of Extinction earlier this month, she said: ‘I’ve loved music for years and I was kind of afraid that there would be no reaction so any kind of reaction is great for me and I’m so happy.

‘And I have dancers. I’m picking the dancers – I want them to be hot for the girls and hot for the boys. I’m loving the whole process.’

Asked if she would date a dancer, she said: ‘They’re not into females so no.’
