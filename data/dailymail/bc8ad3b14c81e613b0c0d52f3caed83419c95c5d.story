Cristiano Ronaldo hiked up his shorts in Real Madrid's training session to show the secret behind that incredibly powerful shot.

The Portuguese, who is looking to win back-to-back Ballon d'Or titles, showed off his muscular legs in the session at Madrid's Valdebebas training base ahead of their match against Celta Vigo on Saturday. 

Ronaldo has been shortlisted alongside rival Lionel Messi and Bayern Munich goalkeeper Manuel Neuer for this years Ballon d'Or - and the Madrid man is favourite.

The Champions League holders looked relaxed in the training session as loanee Javier Hernandez and Marcelo were in fits of laughter as they entered into a race with the lightning-fast Gareth Bale. 

Real Madrid lead La Liga by two points ahead of the weekend games but they are closely followed by rivals Barcelona and Atletico Madrid. 

Arrigo Sacchi was a visitor to the training session. Madrid boss Carlo Ancelotti and captain Sergio Ramos took a break to chat with the former Italy coach, and the trio was seen sharing a joke.
