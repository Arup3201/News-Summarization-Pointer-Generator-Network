Worries: Valerie Amos, U.N. Under Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator, voiced the concerns

The United Nations is investigating reports that aid has yet to reach remote parts of the Philippines a month after a devastating typhoon, the U.N. humanitarian chief said today.

Valerie Amos, U.N. Under Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator, said she had expected that aid had been delivered by helicopter to survivors in even the most remote outlying islands following the disaster on November 8.

Her remarks come amid claims that much of the aid is being siphoned off by corrupt local officials and sold for personal profit.

Emergency
supplies delivered by military helicopters have even turned up on the 
shelves of shops in affluent districts of the capital Manila  – hundreds
of miles from the disaster zone.

'Although we've got significant aid now coming in to the major centers, we still have a little bit of a worry that in a couple of the smaller islands that there may be needs there that we haven't managed to meet yet,' she said.

'I'm still hearing worrying reports in
the media - indeed I heard one this morning - where people said they 
hadn't received any aid as yet, and we're looking into that,' she said.

Typhoon
Haiyan and its tsunami-like storm surge plowed through Tacloban and 
other coastal areas, leaving more than 5,700 dead and more than 1,700 
missing throughout the region. About 4 million people were displaced.

Amos, in Australia for aid talks with 
the government, defended the Philippine government against criticisms 
that it was too slow to deliver aid to victims.

She said the Philippines responded to more than 20 typhoons a year and was well prepared for storms.

'But the scale and severity of this was something which none of us could have anticipated,' Amos said.

On Saturday it was revealed crucial aid sent from Britain to help 
the victims of typhoon-ravaged areas of the Philippines is being 
siphoned off and sold for profit by corrupt local officials.

Desperate: Filipinos rush to get relief goods during a helicopter aid drop. Evidence has emerged that much-needed supplies are being stockpiled by corrupt officials rather than being distributed to those in need

On top of the food seen for sale in shops in Manila, shelter equipment purchased using British donations has also been locked up 
in government warehouses and stockpiled alongside rice and other food 
intended for victims of last month’s catastrophe.

The Disasters Emergency Committee 
(DEC) – an umbrella group representing 14 UK charities – expressed 
concern about evidence that suggests not all the £60 million of aid 
given by Britain is reaching those most in need.

Alarming
evidence of the thefts was provided by expat Keb Darge, 56, who 
said he faces death threats for stopping local officials stealing aid in
Eastern Samar, one of the worst-hit areas.

Mr
Darge, a disc jockey originally from Scotland, said: ‘The aid isn’t 
getting through to where it’s needed. I’ve seen the deliveries arrive 
and I’ve seen them disappear.

‘Only
a tiny percentage of the aid is getting through. The situation isn’t 
going to improve unless there’s an investigation. Someone needs to go 
and find out exactly what is happening. It is British aid coming in. Why
give it to untrustworthy officials to steal? It is ludicrous.’

Mr
Darge photographed supplies being locked up rather than distributed in 
Eastern Samar, where he used to live with his Filipino wife and their 
nine-year-old daughter. Now he has gone into hiding in Manila, fearing 
reprisals after receiving threats from the corrupt officials he has been
trying to expose.
