Jon Whiteford, pictured, collected his mother's benefits for three years after she died

A man kept his dead mother in a freezer for three years while spending her social security money - and then killed himself as police unraveled the mystery.

Police in Kentucky suspect Jon Whiteford dumped the body of his mother, Faye, who would have been 96 this year, at an empty house after he was forced to move out of the home they had shared.

A detective found the body in the garden on April 23 and wrapped in plastic.

The grim case began to unfold in February, when federal investigators contacted Sheriff Todd Wood for help in locating Faye Whiteford, a retired school teacher, and her son.

The Social Security Administration was paying monthly benefits to Faye Whiteford, but she had not logged a medical claim in her name for about three years - an obvious red flag, given her age.

Federal agents told sheriff's detectives that Whiteford's son had access to her finances.

Jon Whiteford decided to continue drawing his mother's Social Security and retirement benefits, making the 'fateful decision' to hide her body in a freezer until he was forced to move out of their home, according to Wood's office. 

Detectives went to Whiteford's home in Science Hill, Somerset Hill, but it was empty.

The Columbus Dispatch said in early March, police located the 59-year-old son when he went to the Social Security office in Somerset to apply for benefits in his name.  

Whiteford told police that his home had been repossessed and that he had been living in his car.

He also confirmed that his mother was dead, but he refused to say how or when she died or tell them where her body was.

Faye Whiteford, who would have turned 96 this year, was kept in a freezer and found wrapped in plastic

As police investigated, they learned that Jon Whiteford was staying at a house next door to where he had lived with his mother in Science Hill.

A deputy went to the house on March 29 to talk to Whiteford again. As the deputy stood at the door, Whiteford pulled a pistol and killed himself, said Lt. detective Brett Whitaker.

Police kept trying to find out what had happened to Faye Whiteford. 

They eventually received information suggesting that her son had been trying to rent a house in neighbouring Wayne County. 

On April 23, Whitaker went to that house, an older structure in need of repair in a rural area.

Whitaker found a tied-up tarpaulin lying in the yard beside the driveway at the house, with Faye Whiteford's body inside.

The body's identity was confirmed this week, state police said.

The investigation indicated that Faye Whiteford had been bedridden for several years, and that her son was her primary caregiver and had control of her finances. 

She didn't have other close relatives nearby, Whitaker said. 

People who knew the family said Whiteford died of natural causes sometime in 2011.
