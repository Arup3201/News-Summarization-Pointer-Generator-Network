An artist has transformed discarded Christmas trees into green 'monsters' by adding googly eyes and facial expressions.

Dean Stockton was shocked at the number of festive trees that had been thrown out after the festive period so decided to give them a new lease of life.

He hung a pair of white baubles with hand-painted eyes on at the top of the trees and used a piece of tinsel for a smile or frown.

He made some look like they are staring at each other or at passersby while others look happy and sad. One dead tree was even given 'crossed out' eyes.

Some of the wacky creations resemble Oscar the Grouch from children's TV show Sesame Street. They are now providing great amusement of the people of London.

Dean, 35, said: 'Every year I've always noticed the huge number of trees that are thrown out after Christmas.

'While I appreciate these cut down trees are generally replaced by seeds or saplings, there's something incredibly wasteful about them just being thrown out.

'So the idea sprung to mind that I could 
recycle them, give them a second life and hopefully get people to 
associate to them differently.

'Part of the rule on how I work is the trees have to be found, they can't be staged, and it has to be how they have been thrown out and found.

'They say "eyes are the window to the soul" and it's pretty easy to give any inanimate object emotions with a pair of eyes.

'As an added expression on some of the trees I included a piece of tinsel to create a mouth, frown or smile.

'People have loved them. The response is generally one of amusement and enjoyment.'

Dumped: Dean set himself a rule that only trees he came across by chance would be decorated with bauble eyes
