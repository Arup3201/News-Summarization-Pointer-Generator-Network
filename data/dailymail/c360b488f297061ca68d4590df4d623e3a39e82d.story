Linda Parkin told the family of a deceased man she would help close his post office account when he died then plundered the vulnerable victim's account

A care home manager stole money from a dead patient's post office savings after telling the victim's family she would help them close the account. 

Linda Parkin, 55, spoke to the family after the elderly man who died in September and offered to help them with his affairs. 

However, Parkin withdrew more than £13,000 from the dead man's account, with £10,000 of this covering fees.

She also took £2,000 from an ex-smoker for cigarettes, even though they had given up the habit. 

Newcastle Crown Court heard that Parkin took the cash because she had been financially mismanaging the Bowland Lodge care home, Western Avenue, Grainger Park, Newcastle. 

Christopher Rose, prosecuting, said she used the rest of the money to pay off other residents' debts which she had allowed to build up, and to buy shopping for the home.

Parkin, from Sunderland, was arrested at home on Christmas Eve and went on to admit theft and fraud.

Judge John Evans sentenced her to a community order for two years with supervision and 160 hours of unpaid work.

The judge told her: 'This is an unusual case of its kind.

'It is not suggested that you personally benefited, had that been the case, the position would be very different.

'It may be that you found yourself out of your depth.'

Rachel Hedworth, defending, said Parkin had put considerable amounts of her own money into the business in a bid to keep it running smoothly.

Miss Hedworth said: 'She was expected to carry out the role of numerous other employees as well as manager.

'She was entirely over stretched and wished she had resigned years ago but was very fond of the residents at the home.'

Miss Hedworth said the married mother of three was deeply ashamed of what she has done.

Newcastle Crown Court heard that  Parkin used the funds to pay off the debts of other residents and to buy food for the home. The court heard that Parkin did not personally benefit after taking any of the cash
