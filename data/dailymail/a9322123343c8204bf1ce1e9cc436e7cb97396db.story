Melting ice from the coast of Greenland could make a much bigger contribution to rising sea levels than was first thought.

Scientists believe a previously overlooked side-effect of global warming - the formation of lakes on top of glaciers - could greatly increase the rate of melting of the vast Greenland ice sheet. 

Previous predictions said Greenland would contribute eight inches (22cm) to global sea levels by 2100, but the new findings   indicate this figure is significantly too low.

University of Leeds researchers say sea levels could rise more quickly. They say lakes on top of glaciers - called supraglacial lakes - could cause Greenland's ice (shown) to slip into the sea more rapidly. This will increase Greenland's contribution to sea levels above the eight inches (22cm) predicted by 2100

The ice in Greenland covers 656,000 square miles (1.7 million square kilometres) - an area three times the size of Texas.

If all the ice melted and flowed into the sea, oceans around the world would rise by as much as 20ft (six metres), causing extensive damage to coastal communities.

While such a disaster is not expected to happen, ice losses from Greenland were predicted to contribute eight inches (22cm) to global sea levels by 2100.

But the new findings related to lakes formed from melted ice and snow indicate that this figure is off the mark. 

Scientists have created a new type of ice that could help geologists better understand the planet’s inner workings, as well as combat climate change.

Named Ice XVI, it is the least dense of all known forms of ice and has a delicate cage-like structure that can trap gaseous molecules.

These molecules can be anything from methane to carbon dioxide, and are contained in ‘clathrate’ cages beneath the sea floor.

By uncovering the intricate structure of these clathrates, scientists hope they can use it for carbon capture and storage, by removing methane from the sea floor and replacing it with CO2.

Scientists at University of Göttingen in Germany and the Institut Laue Langevin in France suspected that the structure of an empty clathrate may look like, but up until now it was hypothetical. 

The study shows that as Arctic temperatures rise, Greenland will develop a rash of these 'supraglacial' lakes, expected to spread much further inland.

By 2060, the amount of land they cover could be double what it is today.

One key effect the lakes have, once they reach a critical size, is to drain through fractures in the ice to reach the ice sheet base. 

Like a lubricant, the lake water causes the melting ice to slide more rapidly into the ocean.

The lakes also have a direct impact on ice sheet melting because, being darker than ice, they absorb more of the sun's heat.

Lead researcher Dr Amber Leeson, from the University of Leeds' School of Earth and Environment, said: 'Supraglacial lakes can increase the speed at which the ice sheet melts and flows, and our research shows that by 2060 the area of Greenland covered by them will double.

'When you pour pancake batter into a pan, if it rushes quickly to the edges of the pan, you end up with a thin pancake. 

'It's similar to what happens with ice sheets: the faster it flows, the thinner it will be.

'When the ice sheet is thinner, it is at a slightly lower elevation and at the mercy of warmer air temperatures than it would have been if it were thicker, increasing the size of the melt zone around the edge of the ice sheet.'

Shown here is a supraglacial lake in Alaska. These form on top of glaciers and can cause ice to slip into the ocean more quickly, leading the scientists to predict that Greenland may contribute more to rising global sea levels than previously thought

Shown here is a simulated distribution of supraglacial lakes in 2050 to 2060 under projections of climate change. Coloured shapes indicate new lakes that appear in each scenario. Likely subglacial drainage pathways are indicated in blue, highlighting how much additional ice could be dragged into the water

The scientists based their findings on observations of the ice sheet from Esa satellites and predictions of future ice melting from a climate simulation model.

Until now, supraglacial lakes have been restricted to a 62-mile (100km) wide low-lying band around Greenland's coastline. At higher elevations further inland it has been too cold for lakes to form.

The new results suggest that warmer temperatures will cause the lakes to spread up to 68 miles (110km) further inland by 2060, doubling the size of the area they cover.

Dr Leeson added: 'The location of these new lakes is important; they will be far enough inland so that water leaking from them will not drain into the oceans as effectively as it does from today's lakes that are near to the coastline and connected to a network of drainage channels.

'In contrast, water draining from lakes farther inland could lubricate the ice more effectively, causing it to speed up.'

The research is published in the journal Nature Climate Change.

Professor Andrew Shepherd, director of the multi-institution Centre for Polar Observation and Modelling (CPOM), who is also from the University of Leeds, said: 'Because ice losses from Greenland are a key signal of global climate change, it's important that we consider all factors that could affect the rate at which it will lose ice as climate warms.

'Our findings will help to improve the next generation of ice sheet models, so that we can have greater confidence in projections of future sea-level rise.

'In the meantime, we will continue to monitor changes in the ice sheet losses using satellite measurements.'
