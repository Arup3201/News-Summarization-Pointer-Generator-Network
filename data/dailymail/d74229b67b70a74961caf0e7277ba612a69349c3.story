A filmmaker and scientists believe a 'huge' super shark could have eaten a three-metre great white shark that was being tracked in a satellite program.

The tracking tag washed up on a Western Australia beach with signs it had been bleached by stomach acid and its data showed rapid changes in depth and a rise in temperature reflecting the animal that ate it.

Filmmaker Dave Riggs was part of the crew documenting the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation's white shark satellite tagging program in 2004 when the three-metre animal was identified about four months before the tag washed up in the Bremer Bay area.

'There was no algae growth and it (the tag) was white - it looked like it had been bleached in stomach acid,' he told MailOnline.

The tag showed an abrupt 580-metre-deep fall down a continental shelf and huge temperature rise, indicating the shark had become prey to a much larger creature.

'The data contained on the shark showed at least the tag had been ingested with an animal with the internal temperature of 26 degrees,' Mr Riggs said.

After talking to sperm whale hunters in the Bremer Bay area, Mr Riggs learnt of sightings off of an animal about 10-and-a-half metres long and others that were tracked travelling at up to 4.5 knots but did not surface.

Filmmaker David Riggs has been trying to solve the mystery of what killed the shark

Through crowd funding, Mr Riggs has been completing expeditions to an area 60 kilometres off the Bremer Bay coast where the shark was tagged.

He has invited scientists to go with him and said none had discounted his theories.

Mr Riggs believes it is most likely that the shark was eaten by another large shark of the mackerel species. 'But by the same token, I'm not 100 per cent convinced,' he added.

'Looking at the profile of the animal that ate it, 26 degrees, that's pretty high but not enough to be a mammal but it's something seriously huge to sustain that temperature - the larger the animal, the more capable it is of an elevated temperature,' he said.

Mr Riggs added that based on the tag data, the animal that ate the device had a stomach area at least one-metre wide.

There have been reports of a 10-and-a-half metre animal in waters near where the shark vanished

'The notion of gigantismis well documented in species, to me that plausible,' he said.

But Mr Riggs said he was not alluding to some mythical creature. 'I'm not going down to notion of a prehistoric beast roaming out there,' he said.

'This is nature at work and we are just trying to get to the bottom of something that happened years ago.'

'I don't know that we will ever know what happened to that animal, but if the reports are true (from the whalers) we may get a glimpse at what they saw.'

With the mystery sparking Mr Riggs' interest, he sought production funding with his project partners to create The Search for the Ocean's Super Predator for the ABC, which has recently been re-cut for the U.S. audiences.

The shark disappeared about 60 kilometres off Bremer Bay on the Western Australia coast

For about eight years Mr Riggs observed the area, 60 kilometres off Bremer Bay, Western Australia,Â  where the shark was believed to have been taken.

The filmmaker observed large numbers of killer whales and also a deep sea hydro carbon system leak in the same area.

He also noticed a large aggregation of animals, including sperm whales, pilot whales, blue fin tuna, oceanic sun fish and other species of shark in the area during summer.

'I started joining the dots - it appears to me likely that the incident has something to do with this multi-spieces aggregation,' he said.

But Mr Riggs questioned the likelihood of the shark being eaten by a killer whale, because the mammal has a similar temperature to a human and too high for that recorded by the tag.

But the filmmaker did develop a theory that the impact of the hydro carbon leak and that it was fertilising the ocean canyon where the shark went missing.

'There's something happening out there that's causing the aggregation of life - there are 36 underwater canyons between Western Australia and South Australia but this is the only one located with this intensity of life,' he said.

He hopes to be able to complete a sequel to the original documentary in the future.

The great white shark is found on all of Australia's coastline and can range between three-and-a-half to five metres long and weigh on average 1,300 kilograms
