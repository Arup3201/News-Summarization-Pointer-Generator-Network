Mr Hovey said: 'My sculptures are about the things that I enjoy - wildlife, welding and humour.

'It is my goal that the animal's appearance is appreciated first for its form. Then, on closer inspection, the details of the forks, knives, and spoons bring enjoyment on a whole new level.

'The different patterns add texture and interest to each piece. I also like the way the stainless steel reflects the surroundings so that it looks at home in nearly any situation.'

Mr Hovey learned his metal-working skills in Tulsa, Oklahoma, where he coordinated the metal shop at Turkey Track Bronze Works.

He also has experience as a skilled welder and a metal fabricator.

In 1978 Mr Hovey saw a sculpture made of welded car bumpers.

Quarter
 of a century later he decided to turn his hand to something similar but
 smaller in the hope of bringing art into people's homes.

He said: 'I like to incorporate movement and attitude into my art, and, where possible, a story.

'I decided to work with spoons. Old cutlery is abundant and comes in so many different patterns.

'Soon I was developing intricate figures of stainless steel flatware.

'I
 was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease in 1994 so my art is a challenge
 for me, but my workshop is right by my house so I can just go and work 
when I feel up to it.

'I find producing and showing my work acts as a type of therapy for me.'

Mr Hovey has participated in solo and group exhibitions and has won awards for his art.
