A new reality series that charts the lives of teen and young adults who have never had sex is stirring up controversy among parents and viewers.

Virgin Territory, which premieres on MTV on Wednesday at 11pm, features 15 virgins between 18 and 23 who are either saving themselves or actively looking to have sex.

But while the network says the aim is to 'elevate the discussion of responsible sexual health,' some are concerned that it might send the wrong message by putting virginity in a negative light.

Touchy subject: A controversial new MTV reality series called Virgin Territory charts the lives of 18 to 23-year-olds who have never had sex

Divisive: The network has said the aim is to 'elevate the discussion of responsible sexual health,' but some are concerned that it might send the wrong message by putting virginity in a negative light

'Based on the way it's being advertised - and, let's face it, based on MTV's history with their programming - we're not anticipating that they are going to treat the subject respectfully,' Melissa Henson, who works on the Parent's Television Council, told Fox News.

In a trailer for the show, each star explains the reasons that they have not yet had sex.

'The first relationship is the most important, and that's my relationship with God,' says a boy named Luke, who was raised by his pastor father in a small town in Minnesota.

'The toughest part about being a virgin is not being able to have sex,' he laughs, before adding: 'Sex is something that you want to save for your wife.' 

Drama: 'Messy love lives, awkward parental sex talks, sexually active friends, and the pressure to give in to their temptations - all can make for a very tumultuous journey,' reads the MTV website

Another boy explains earnestly: 'I'm waiting for that special someone,' echoing the sentiments of many of the other stars.

But the show also features 20-somethings who are desperate to lose their virginity - like Mikaela, 'a virgin on the prowl for a nice tattooed, alternative hipster to lose her virginity to,' according to her bio.

'Messy love lives, awkward parental sex talks, sexually active friends, and the pressure to give in to their temptations - all can make for a very tumultuous journey for these abstinent adolescents,' reads the MTV website.

Variety: Each hour-long episode will follow four different castmembers from across the country as they navigate their lives and all the complications they face

Each hour-long episode will follow four different castmembers from across the country as they navigate their lives and all the complications they face.

'MTV has a legacy of documenting the lives of young adults and openly talking about sex with thought-provoking programming,' said senior vice president of series development Lauren Dolgen.

'Through our ongoing partnership with the National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy, MTV will continue this tradition by elevating the discussion of responsible sexual health to include the topic of virginity in a way that our audience might find surprising.'

Still, some Twitter users have voiced their disgust at the show's invasion of privacy, with one person writing: 'Wow... they have no taste left!'

Backlash: Some people have taken issue with the moral behind the show, with one critic tweeting: 'I don't think @MTV helps young teens and adults with these types of shows'

Surprising: 'You're going to see women who want to lose it, women who want to keep it, men who want to lose it, men who want to keep it,' said one of the stars. 'It's going to change the way that we look at sex'

Another 
person wrote: 'Virgin territory comes on after teen mom 2.  What 
happened to television.' And a third person said: 'I don't think @MTV 
helps young teens and adults with these types of shows.'

'It' will change the way we look at how each gender wants sex'

But 
according to one of the castmembers named Alex, who grew up in a small 
town where he felt he couldn't be openly gay, viewers of Virgin 
Territory are in for a surprise.

'You're going to see women who want to lose it, women who want to keep it, men who want to lose it, men who want to keep it,' he said in a statement.

'It's going to change the way that we look at how each gender wants sex.'
