They're there to study - but it must be hard when you live in Britain's biggest student house.

Regent House in Plymouth, Devon, is home to 32 undergraduates who host parties around the clock in monster digs made up of four huge terraced homes knocked into one.

Each week they collectively down 500 cans of beer, watch 1,300 hours of daytime TV, and eat 100 tins of beans.

The tenants, all Plymouth University students, spend between £75 and £100 per week to live in the property just a short walk to campus.

Making a mess: Eight females and 24 males live in the house, and it needs three cleaners six days a week to keep the place in good shape

Student meals: Charlotte uses a hob in one of the house's four kitchens. The residents have a loose schedule of who cooks and when

To meet their needs it is kitted out with 22 toilets and four kitchens.

But, in a house where around 50 Pot Noodles and 150 takeaways are eaten a week, they produce quite a lot of rubbish - 20 bin bags worth.

No wonder they have a team of three cleaners on site six days a week just to take care of the mess.

Photos taken by housemates of life inside the house show endless parties - with people asleep in corridors and students drinking beer from a bin.

The 24 males and eight girls are supposed to attend 320 hours of lectures a week, on everything from civil engineering and business to fine art and midwifery.

But that figure is dwarfed by the estimated 1,300 hours spent watching student TV favourites like Countdown - and the 900 hours spent on one of the numerous PlayStations.

Student Thomas Riggs, 20, has managed to keep up with his studies while living in Regent House for three years. 

Party time: The students dressed up before a party inside the sprawling property. Even former students return to let the good times roll

Drinking games: Ed Joseph downs a 'beer bong' while his mates cheer him on. Constant partying can make the place distracting and 'crazy'

Gentle pursuits: When students aren't studying, cooking or partying, they can be found playing pool or darts - or hide and seek with the lights out

The third-year English and Creative Writing student said: 'We go on several nights out a week and pretty much every night we have a drink in the house - so it pretty much feels like one big party.

'The house is crazy and intense but at the same time it's a lot of fun. We're like one very, very big family.

'We all get on really well and it's great to have so many different personalities and characters in one house. Christmas is my favourite time of year - last year we had over 50 people over for dinner.'

Knocked through: Regent House started life as four separate terraced houses, which were knocked through into one complex of rooms

Heavy night? While many say that the non-stop drinking can be exhausting - these pale and bloodied faces are not the results of hard partying - but make-up ahead of a Halloween party

No need for furniture: When the fun kicks off in earnest, any part of the enormous property - including halls and floors - are used

Floor plan: An architectural drawing of Regent House shows multiple rooms, many of them en-suite, 22 other toilets, seven showers, one bath and three kitchens

The cavernous accommodation started out life as four Victorian properties in the city's Mutley suburb, which were originally knocked together into a nursing home.

In the 1990s it was converted into communal accommodation and is now marketed by a private landlord as an 'A Graded Student Letting'.

Most rooms have en-suite loos and washbasins, and there are 22 other toilets and seven shower cubicles dotted over two floors.

Passed out: Not all the rooms in the property are always in use, as one student can be seen here preferring a hard cold kitchen floor to a nice warm bed

Keeping clean: One of the seven shower rooms, this one is a dual one. But students who prefer a bath might need to be a little more patient - as there is only one in the property

Student life: A world exists outside the property, of course, as can be seen in this photo of students watching the sunrise over Plymouth, Devon

Every now and then, they do some study: George Daykin, 21, in his room - showing that some serious work does get done

Multicultural: The students, who come from countries across the globe and are aged between 18 to 24, study subjects ranging from civil engineering, to fine art to business to midwifery

It boasts just one dining room but three separate kitchens equipped with five freezers, five fridges, four ovens and four washing machines.

Students can also laze around in two spacious lounges equipped with flat-screen TV's and Sky satellite television, or use a dart board and full-size pool table.

The property is full from September to July, raking in around £11,520 a month and about £126,000 a year in rent for the owner.

Feeling woozy? A student with bins full of booze, about to take a gulp. Little wonder, then, that the photograph is out of focus

Cupboard is almost bare: Many former university students will look at this image with a pang of nostalgia, and a pang of hunger

How many of these freezers contain vodka? The property also contains five fridges and four washing machines - all being in full use befre and after one of the many parties

On average each week the 32 students get through:

40 loo rolls; 20 bin bags of rubbish; 100 tins of baked beans; 20 large bags of pasta; 500 cans of beer; 150 cans of cider; 50 Pot Noodles; 150 takeaways.

Each week they collectively spend:

320 hours at lectures; 311 hours partying at nightclubs; 1,300 hours watching TV; 900 hours playing PlayStation; 224 hours playing pool.

The sprawling house is comprised of:

32 bedrooms; 22 toilets; two living rooms; three kitchens; one utility room; seven showers (four of which are duo); one bath; a pool table; a dart board; four washing machines; five fridges; five freezers; four ovens.

Regent House has a warden who works in
an office in the property five days a week, and when he's not there 
Thomas deals with complaints and other issues.

Students
cook throughout the evening in unofficial shifts from 5pm to midnight, 
often teaming up for massive stir-fries before taking turns to do the 
washing up.

There's one space going spare at the moment because two people are a couple - and have moved in to the same room.

Mr Riggs added: 'We almost have a system in place whereby the longer people have lived in the house, the nicer their room is.

'As I've lived here for three years, I've upgraded from one of the smallest rooms in the house to a large room with bay windows and an en-suite.

'The great thing is that it's like living in halls but for three years.

'I thought about moving out for my third year, as I thought it would be too distracting, but I knew I'd miss it a lot so decided to stay. It's not for everyone, but I love it.'

Doing a 'starfish': George Streets is ably helped by a number of assistants as he completes a tricky stunt that - of course - involves drinking beer

Dietetics student Sara Jones, 19, said: 'It's so much fun living in the house. It can be noisy and hectic but I'm pretty noisy, so it's fine.

'The house can be a big distraction and it's often really hard to stay in when there's so many people drinking, as it feels like a house party, so I'll normally end up joining in.

'After nights out we'll often discover people who don't live here who've slept in the house. It can be pretty crazy.

'Hide and seek in the house is a lot of fun. We turn all the lights off then hide in random places.'

Old housemates who have left university visit the property regularly to relive their student days.

Rachael Warren, 20, who graduated last year and now works as a waitress, said: 'I live down the road but come here a couple of times a week.

'I felt it was best I moved out of Regent House once I decided to leave uni and get a job, because of how distracting it can be, but I still come for all the nights out - there's no better place for it.'
