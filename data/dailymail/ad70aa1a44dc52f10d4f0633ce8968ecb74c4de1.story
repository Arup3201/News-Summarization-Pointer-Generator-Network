She's famous for her conservative sense of style but that didn't stop Spain's Queen Letizia from flashing a glimpse of thigh during a reception at the Zarzuela Palace today.

The 42-year-old opted for an unusually short cream shift dress for the event, which was held to honour members of the Academia de las Artes y Las Ciencias Cinematograficas - the Spanish cinema association.

Letizia's daring new look represented a departure from her usual midi length, although she did take some precautions, teaming the dress with neat courts and a pair of opaque black tights.

With her at the event was 46-year-old King Felipe who was dapper in a black suit and who, at one point, put his arm around his wife as he helped her into position.

The Academia de las Artes y Las Ciencias Cinematograficas is one of the biggest champions of Spanish cinema and is responsible for the annual Goya awards - Spain's equivalent of the BAFTAS.

The current president, film producer Enrique González Macho, was among the guests to greet the Spanish royals at the Zarzuela Palace this morning, while his predecessors include Álex de la Iglesia, a pioneering director who mentored Pedro Almodóvar.

This is not the first time the Spanish royals, who are currently in mourning for the late Queen Fabiola of Belgium, have shown their support for the arts in recent months.

Letizia in particular is known to be a fan and travelled to Vienna at the beginning of October to open an exhibition dedicated to Spanish court painter, Diego Velázquez.

Stop! King Felipe stepped in to help his wife at one point, when she appeared to be going the wrong way

Later the same week, she and King Felipe were both on hand for the launch of a new Spanish dictionary and have consistently championed the arts since ascending to the throne in June.

The two have also overseen a sea-change in the way the Spanish royal family does business, with Felipe banning private employment and accepting lavish gifts last week.

The new rules, which also apply to former King Juan-Carlos and his wife Queen Sofia, come into effect on New Year's Day and are intended to avoid 'compromising the dignity of the institution'.

Felipe's move comes after his father's reign was blighted by accusations of extravagance - not helped by his habit of accepting gifts that included an €18m (£14m) yacht.

Fortuna, which Juan-Carlos was forced to stop using last year in a nod to austerity, became a regular plaything of the Spanish royals, who used it during summer holidays in Mallorca.

Felipe's new-look Spanish monarchy is closer in style to the Scandinavian system, which sees members of the royal family live relatively low key lifestyles.

As part of his drive to modernise the institution, the 46-year-old royal also banned members of his family from working in the private sector and insisted that all must behave in an 'exemplary manner' likely to 'earn citizens' appreciation, respect and trust.'

Despite boasting fewer staff and less money than their British and Spanish counterparts, the Norwegian, Danish and Swedish monarchs and their families do accept gifts, although like the British royals, most have to be declared.

In the case of the UK royal family, gifts either become part of the Royal Collection and are displayed during the summer exhibition season or are donated to the relevant museum or institution.

Although the Queen is yet to benefit from a free flight or a yacht like Juan-Carlos, she has received a number of unusual gifts on state visits, including a collection of shells, a set of lacrosse sticks, sunglasses, a pair of sandals, pineapples, eggs, a box of snail shells, a grove of maple trees, a dozen tins of of tuna and 7kg of prawns.

The Queen has also been given a number of horses, among them her Trooping the Colour mount, Burmese, and a series of exotic animals, including a canary, jaguars, sloths and an elephant called Jumbo - all of which were given to London Zoo.
