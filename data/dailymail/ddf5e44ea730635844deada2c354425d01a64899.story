Scottish Labour leader Johann Lamont quit last night, with a bitter attack aimed at Ed Miliband.

After weeks of infighting, with the Scottish party in ‘meltdown’, Miss Lamont stood down with a shock denouncement of the Labour leadership.

She accused colleagues of trying to run Scotland ‘like a branch office from London’, saying she had been left no choice but to resign.

Johann Lamont is understood to be angry with Mr Miliband for failing to support her following the referendum

The 57-year-old had faced weeks of pressure to quit following her disappointing referendum performance and is understood to be angry with Mr Miliband for failing to support her.

Sources say she has grown sick of internal party sniping and believes she has become a ‘scapegoat’ for party failures in Scotland. Rumours had been circulating that former Prime Minister Gordon Brown and Blairite Jim Murphy were being lined up to take over.

But the final straw was said to be a row over the UK party’s decision to axe Scots Labour General Secretary Ian Price.

Her resignation is a double blow for Mr Miliband, as it leaves Labour without a Scottish leader only six months from the General Election and with no obvious successor.

Following the announcement, incoming First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said Scottish Labour was ‘in meltdown’.

Miss Lamont told the Daily Record: ‘Scotland’s place is in the UK and I do not believe in powers for power’s sake. For example, I think power should be devolved from Holyrood to communities.

‘But colleagues need to realise the focus of Scottish politics is now Holyrood, not Westminster.’

Miss Lamont described some Labour MPs as ‘dinosaurs’ who failed to recognise that ‘Scotland has changed forever after the referendum

She added: ‘Any leader whose general secretary can be removed by London without any consultation is in an untenable position.

‘That has to change. The Scottish Labour Party must be a more autonomous party which works in partnership with the UK party.

‘We must be allowed to make our own decisions and control our own resources.

‘I believe the Scottish Labour Party is a family – it is my family. And I hope it is led by someone who knows how to treat family members properly.’

She said she was forced to quit after her attempts to reform the Scottish party were thwarted by Labour’s Westminster leadership.

Miss Lamont described some Labour MPs as ‘dinosaurs’ who failed to recognise that ‘Scotland has changed forever after the referendum’.

She had faced pressure to step down following the referendum. The Yes campaign triumphed in Labour’s heartlands of Glasgow, Dundee, North Lanarkshire and West Dunbartonshire and won in her own seat of Glasgow Pollok.

Miss Lamont was elected as party leader in 2011, having acted as its deputy leader and having represented her constituency since 1999.

Her official resignation announcement is expected today, with immediate effect, and her deputy, Anas Sarwar MP, will become acting leader.

Earlier this week, former Labour First Ministers Lord McConnell and Henry McLeish suggested the party needed to be renewed.

Lord McConnell said the party must ‘rediscover our sense of purpose, our vision for Scotland’. His predecessor, Mr McLeish, said: ‘Labour has to realise every vote has got to be fought for.’

Miss Lamont’s resignation will be a blow to Mr Miliband, who faces losing Scottish Labour votes over proposals to resolve the West Lothian Question.

After losing ground to the SNP, the Scottish Labour Party has been torn between those who want it to move to the Left and centrists such as Mr Murphy, who is believed to have fallen out of favour with Mr Miliband. Shadow Scottish Secretary Margaret Curran, on the Left of the party, has said it must return to its ‘socialist principles’.

There had been suggestions Mr Murphy could become Scottish leader. But he has resisted the call, with Mr Brown also refusing entreaties to become ‘father of the nation’.

Criticising bosses in the Labour Party for failing to allow Scotland more autonomy, Miss Lamont told the newspaper some in Labour circles in Westminster ‘do not understand the politics they are facing’.

She said: I am proud of what we have achieved over the last three years. We held Alex Salmond to account.’

Miss Sturgeon tweeted that if reports of divisions between the Scottish and UK Labour parties were accurate, then ‘@scottishlabour really is in meltdown’.

Green MSP Patrick Harvie said: ‘Scottish voters deserve to have the option of an effective Labour Party which can advocate the values and principles which its UK leadership has long ago surrendered.’

A UK Labour Party source paid tribute to Miss Lamont, saying: ‘Ed [Miliband] regards her as an honourable woman who has served the party well and we hope will serve the party again in the future.’
