A woman who posted a photo of sleeping Patriots star Julian Edelman following their Tinder hook-up has apologised after suffering a backlash of abuse.

The woman, known only as Sabrina, posted a selfie of herself next to the New England Patriots wide receiver while he was fast asleep in bed following his team's Superbowl victory. 

The caption on the photo, which she then added to her Tinder profile, said: 'Just f***** Edelman no lie'.

Julian Edelman acknowledges cheers from the crowd gathered for the New England Patriot's Superbowl parade on Wednesday. A woman has now posted a photo of the player sleeping next to her in bed

But she has since apologised for what was labelled a gross violation of the player's privacy after she suffered a backlash of abuse and was banned from Boston nightclubs.

Michael Winter, one of the biggest nightclub promoters in Boston, told TMZ he would blacklist her from the city's nightclubs.

He added: 'You're a five if that and he was blackout. I'm sure I speak on behalf of many Boston industry ppl to not show your face in this city.'

However, she has since apologised for sneaking the selfie and said she 'made a mistake'.

She told TMZ: 'He passed out and I was bored I guess. Some of the players were texting me that they were really disappointed. I obviously made a mistake and I can't take it back.'

Sabrina also said it was unlikely that the nightclub ban would last, claiming she had friends who worked in Boston nightclubs who said she was still welcome.

Edelman, 28, scored the winning touchdown in Sunday's Superbowl XLIX in the fourth quarter against the Seattle Seahawks.
