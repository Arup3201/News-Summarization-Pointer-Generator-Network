An Illinois woman drowned on Tuesday after saving a nine-year-old boy who was swimming in a Wisconsin lake near her family's summer home.

Karen Wessel, 47, died in Star Lake near the Michigan border after rescuing her friend's grandson, who became tired while swimming across a narrow channel with two other children, according to the Vilas County Sheriff’s office.

'She gave her life,' said Chuck Altamore, grandfather of the nine-year-old. 'If it wasn’t for her, my grandson wouldn't be here.'

Before the accident, Wessel was enjoying a hot summer day with her sister, Janice Potocki, and friend Karen Altamore, wife of Chuck Altamore, who live in the area, according to an account in the Chicago Tribune. Three of the couple's grandchildren were also there, along with Wessel's son.

'It's our summer home that we've been going up to for our entire lives,' Potocki said.

The three women went to the water for a swim when, according to Karen Altamore, three of the children began wading across the a narrow channel dividing the main shoreline from a sandbar. They became too tired to swim back, and the women swam out to save them, becoming exhausted as well.

'The three kids were in trouble,' Chuck Altamore said. 'Each adult picked a kid. Janice went for (Wessel’s son); my wife, Karen, went for my granddaughter, and Karen (Wessel) went for my grandson.'

Wessel reached the boy and used her weight to keep the child above the surface, but she eventually vanished into the water. 

A boat came by and grabbed the boy, but Wessel couldn't be immediately spotted. She was later seen floating below the surface.

Wessel and the boy were taken to a nearby hospital, where she was pronounced dead. The boy was

'He flatlined for a few minutes,' his grandfather said. 'He was clinically dead for three or four minutes.'

He's now recovering at home and there are no signs  of permanent injuries.

'Brain activity is fine,' Altamore said. 'Motor skills are fine. I’ve spoken to him for 20 minutes straight.'

Chuck Altamore wasn't at the scene Tuesday but said his wife was too distraught to discuss it.

'She lost her best friend, and we almost lost our grandson,' he said.

He said he's known Wessel for more than two decades.

'It’s been rough couple of days,' he said, becoming emotional. 'She was a very caring and understanding person. Her children were life.'

Wessel and Potocki grew up in Arlington Heights and moved back to the village as adults. Potocki said she took over the house they grew up in after their parents died and bought the house next door for Wessel.

'It was always the two of us,' Potocki said. 'Where there was one, there was the other.'

Wessel, a secretary at a law firm in Chicago, is also survived by a daughter.

Don Bussey, a family friend who lives in the neighborhood, said Wessel was a selfless woman who loved her children deeply and overcame the struggles of being a single mom.

'That’s who Karen was,' he said. 'She was a hero.'
