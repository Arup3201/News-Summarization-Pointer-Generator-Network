Sergio Aguero is a monumental figure within the Argentina squad, but the star striker might have met his match, figuratively speaking, on Monday.

The 26-year-old took to Twitter to upload a sight-seeing picture during his travels with his international team-mates.

Accompanied with the caption: 'Con @Argentina en Washington DC//With @Argentina in Washington DC,' Aguero can be seen standing in the American capital beset with the backdrop of the Washington Monument.

Aguero is in USA at the moment ahead of Argentina's friendlies against El Salvador and Ecuador later this month.

The Manchester City striker is among a host of European-based stars included in Gerardo Martino's squad - which also Barcelona superstar Lionel Messi and Napoli forward Gonzalo Higuain.

The double set of fixtures are part of Argentina's plans ahead of this summer's Copa America.

And Martino has complained about the scheduling of the European Champions League final which could involve a number of his players five days before the Copa America kicks off in Chile.

The Champions League final in Berlin is scheduled for June 6 and a large number of South American internationals play for the eight clubs that have reached the quarter-finals. 

'We need to have the players from the first day and they are very keen to take part in the Copa America but they are also going to want to play the Champions League final after preparing all year,' Martino said.

'It's going to be a tough decision, the fact I don't have to take it (yet) is because we haven't got there yet. Martino told a news conference at Argentine FA headquarters.

'It seems to me that little thought is given to the needs of what happens on this side of the world,' he said in a veiled dig at European body UEFA.'
