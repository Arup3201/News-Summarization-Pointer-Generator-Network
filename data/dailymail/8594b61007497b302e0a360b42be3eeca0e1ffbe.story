As her bills stacked up, this artist turned her credit card statements into a canvas for her beautifully detailed bird drawings to relieve her financial stresses.

While she was looking for work during the recession, Paula Swisher, 37, began sketching birds such as owls and vultures on her bills and paper ripped from books to save on art supplies.

She says drawing on her bills is a playful commentary on the predatory financial institutions and the stress of managing her finances as a freelancer.

Ms Swisher has drawn hundreds of birds in her lifetime and puts her love of ornithology down to the nature walks she went on when as a youngster.

Some of her favourite birds include herons, sparrows, crows, red-winged blackbirds and warblers.

Ms Swisher, from Racine in Wisconsin, America, drew her first bird when she was seven and reckons she has drawn hundreds since.

She said: ‘In a good week I'll work on several different bird drawings - it takes several hours to complete a single piece.

‘My mother was an avid nature lover and took my siblings and I on nature walks teaching us the names of all the birds, trees and plants around us. That appreciation for nature has stayed with me.

‘During the recession I was struggling to scrape together enough freelance design projects.

‘Wanting to draw but needing to focus my time on seeking freelance work I made a deal with myself that I could only draw if it was with non-art materials.

In flight impact: Ms Swisher said she 'tends to draw the bird that will have the best impact with the page I am drawing on rather than the bird that I like the most'

‘I started tearing out pages from old books and working in ball-point ink and white-out. I enjoyed working with the content of the pages, transforming the meaning of the text with what I drew on it. 

‘The drawings on bills explores a common stressor among creative people - paying bills and managing finances.

‘But it also makes a playful commentary on predatory businesses and the role of lending institutions in the financial collapse which was when I started drawing.

‘I tend to draw the bird that will have the best impact with the page I am drawing on rather than the bird that I like the most.’
