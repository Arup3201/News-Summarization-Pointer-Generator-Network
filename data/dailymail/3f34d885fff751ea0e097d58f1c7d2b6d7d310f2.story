Police have ruled out a militant or criminal attack as the cause of death of an American religious student in Israel whose body was found in a wooded area in Jerusalem.

The body of Aaron Sofer, of Lakewood, New Jersey was discovered yesterday after he disappeared after going out hiking last week.

An extensive search was launched to find the 23-year-old ultra-Orthodox Jew, who was attending a yeshiva, a Jewish religious school in Israel named after its founder Rabbi Tzvi Kaplan.

Police had said that at one point they were pursuing all avenues in their investigation, including the possibility that Mr Sofer may have fallen victim to an attack by Palestinian militants, in their search for him.

However, police spokeswoman Luba Samri confirmed today that the body found was that of Mr Sofer but added 'there is no suspicion of foul play'.

There were no further details on how the student died.

According to 7online his body was found in a shallow two foot ditch with his hat and glasses 150 yards away.

Paying tribute to the student Brooklyn Assemblyman Dov Hikind said in a statement: 'All of us were hoping and praying that there would be a happy ending and that Aaron would be found safe.

'We are stunned, saddened and pained by this tragic discovery.'

Volunteers also joined in with the search for Mr Sofer, who has last been seen by a friend as they hiked over a wooded slope 

It is thought that Mr Sofer was with a friend when they decide to go hiking last Friday in the Jerusalem Forest, which is said to be just the third of the size of Central Park in New York City.

It had been reported that he only took with him a jacket and a hat.

But he failed to return home after becoming separated from a friend on a wooded slope, near to where a Palestinian boy was found burned last month in a revenge attack for the murder of three Israeli students in June.

It came on the same day a ceasefire was declared between Israel and Hamas.

His parents, Chulda and Moshe Zvi then flew to Israel to help with the search for their son after making an emotional plea for help to find their son.

A news conference was held in Mr Sofer's hometown of Lakewood, New Jersey to draw attention to the plight of the missing student 

A large gathering of people turned up to the conference on Tuesday, which was addressed by Mr Sofer's brother Yaahkov 

Fighting back the tears his mother said: 'I beg you if anyone has seen Aaron please call the police immediately.' 

On Tuesday New Jersey politicians attended a news conference to draw attention to the plight of the missing student.

At the event Mr Sofer's brother Yaahkov pleaded, 'Please bring him back' but declined to speak further about his brother, who is one of 10 children in the family.

While another brother Yoel said: 'He came to take a little walk. He had his shoes, his hat and jacket, he just needed a little fresh air.

'We just want him back. Whatever anyone can do to get him back. Please pray for him..
