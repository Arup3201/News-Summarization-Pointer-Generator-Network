The brother of Stuart Hall, pictured outside Preston Crown Court on Thursday, was cleared of indecently assaulting a 13-year-old girl in 1991

Stuart Hall’s younger brother was cleared of indecently assaulting a 13-year-old girl after a three-day trial in 1991.

Within minutes of the verdict, Keith Hall quit his job as deputy director of Essex Social Services, which he had held for 12 years.

It was alleged during the trial that Mr Hall, then 56, fondled the girl in his office in Chelmsford and on another occasion while her mother, with whom he was having an affair, sat unaware in the same car.

The girl alleged that Hall tried to kiss her up to 20 times between July 1989 and February 1990.

Summing up at Norwich Crown Court, Judge Michael Hyam told the jury: ‘It is dangerous for you to convict on the evidence of the girl alone in the absence of corroboration.

'You have to decide whether it is likely a man of Mr Hall’s character would commit the offence.’

Mr Hall, of Stanway, near Colchester, who was chairman of the Essex child protection committee for two years, was unanimously acquitted.

He had denied the allegations, describing them as ‘nonsense’.

He said his relationship with the girl had been ‘normally affectionate’ and fatherly.

His wife Marjorie, who stood by him, said they had received tremendous support from friends and family, including his brother.

After the case, Mr Hall said: ‘I am delighted with the result. Justice has been done.

'I had the confidence of a man who was innocent and I was confident in British justice.’

He said he felt no bitterness to the girl and that his marriage was still strong.

‘I think most marriages have problems from time to time,’  he said.

‘My marriage has always been strong and will continue to be.’
