Stan Wawrinka qualified for the semi-finals of the end-of-season ATP World Tour finals as he quickly secured the three games he needed in 13 minutes against Marin Cilic on Friday.

When Wawrinka broke the Croatian's serve to move into a 3-1 lead in the opening set of their final round-robin match, it guaranteed that he would make it to the last four for a second successive year.

Wawrinka then went on to clinch a 6-3, 4-6, 6-3 victory and the Swiss will now play compatriot and great friend, Roger Federer, in Saturday's semi-finals at the O2 Arena.

'It was a tough match, it's never easy to play against Marin, he's been having an amazing year,' said Wawrinka. 'To win is important for me.'

Wawrinka has played Federer 16 times and won only twice, but one of those came this year in the final of the Monte Carlo Masters.

He said: 'I hope I can get a little bit of support because I know people love him here. It's going to be tough for me, but I need to trust myself and go for it.'

Earlier, champion Novak Djokovic had defeated Tomas Berdych 6-2 6-2 to ensure he would meet Japan's Kei Nishikori in Saturday's first semi-final.
