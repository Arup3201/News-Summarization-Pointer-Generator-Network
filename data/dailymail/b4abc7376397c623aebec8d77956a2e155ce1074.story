Most of us welcome the beginning of summer, with its brighter weather and longer days.

But for one teenager, it spells the beginning of virtual hibernation - for fear of agonising pain. 

Autumn Everitt-Brick, from Welwyn Garden City, Hertfordshire, suffers an extremely rare reaction to UV light and heat.

Exposure causes immediate reddening and blistering to her skin, leaving her confined to her home for fear of a painful attack.

She has since been diagnosed with multiple allergies and conditions including Solar Dermatitis, Vasodilation Disorder and Chronic Actinic Dermatitis

The 18-year-old said: 'Being allergic to the sun and heat has meant I can't lead a normal life like any other teenager.

'Instead I've become nocturnal to escape the sun.

'People often think I'm lying, but it's absolutely devastating.

'All I want to do is simple things in life like walk to the shops or learn how to drive.'

While she had always suffered from skin problems, Autumn's condition began to cause severe complications when she was 13 - and suffered a severe reaction to the sun.

'I'd only been out there for ten minutes but my shoulders burnt so badly that my dad compared me to a human candle,' she recalled. 

'It was as though my skin was melting and I was inconsolable - the pain was horrendous.

'That's when I think we all knew that something was really wrong as no-one burns like that, it wasn't normal.'

Autumn went to see various doctors and dermatologists before undergoing dozens of tests - including one to see if she was allergic to the family's pets.

She has since been diagnosed with multiple allergies and conditions including Solar Dermatitis, Vasodilation Disorder and Chronic Actinic Dermatitis.

She said: 'All of the different allergies and conditions combined are crippling and make life extremely difficult.

'Even when I go to the hospital or doctors I go beetroot red, because the lights in the waiting rooms are so fluorescent.'

Indeed, any UV light or temperature change can cause her skin to dry, crack and come out in hives and lesions which are extremely painful.

While she had always suffered from skin problems, Autumn's condition began to cause severe complications when she was 13 - and suffered a severe reaction to the sun

After 10 minutes in the sun as a young teenager, she suffered a severe reaction. 'It was as though my skin was melting and I was inconsolable - the pain was horrendous,' she said 

She added: 'It took a long time for me to be diagnosed and I had to wait over six months to see a leading specialist.

'In this time I was prescribed steroid tablets but disastrously they made me put on six stone in a really short space of time.

'I was unrecognisable and developed two near fatal conditions on top of everything else.'

As Autumn's condition became worse her parents had to make the tough decision to home school her.

She said: 'School became hard as no-one understood what was wrong and people judged me.

Matthew Gass, spokesperson for the British Association of Dermatologists said: 'Solar urticaria describes a relatively rare type of urticarial (also known as hives and weals) which is induced by exposing your skin to sunlight.

'While it can start at any age, it appears to be those aged between 20 and 40 who are most affected.

'Solar urticaria is caused by the release of histamine from cells in the skin called mast cells.

'The main symptoms of solar urticaria are itching, stinging and burning. 

'Rarely the rash is accompanied by symptoms such as headache, nausea, vomiting, breathing difficulties and low blood pressure.

'Taking measures to avoid to sunlight exposure is important to prevent its occurrence and you can do simple things like wear sun cream, sensible clothing, gloves, photo protective window films and take antihistamines.'  

'I began to miss most lessons as the florescent lights everywhere were causing me to react and I couldn't escape the daylight.

'It was easier to learn from home and over time we've managed to get my allergies somewhat under control.'

Her typical day now consists of waking up at 5pm. 'My dinner has become my breakfast and I stay up all night chatting to people from Australia,' she explained. 

'I paint a lot to pass the time while everyone else sleeps and it's become a real passion of mine.

'I can't really remember life before my allergies, but I wish I could do normal things other people are doing my age.'

She has been told that as she gets older, the allergies should calm down - but she still worries about the future. 

Even as a child, Autumn suffered with skin problems.

She had eczema by the time she was just six weeks old, but her parents, Andy and Sally, dismissed it and thought it was just irritated skin as she was born healthy with no complications.

Mr Everitt-Brick, 45, a freelance software developer said: 'From the age of three, Autumn's skin gradually became more and more irritated.

'We just didn't know what was wrong with her, we tried everything to sooth her skin but it would always dry out again and become really sore.

'It's horrible watching your little girl grow up and not being able to help or know what's wrong.

'It's so tragic as Autumn is now 18 and she should be able to go out and socialise and not be stuck in her room hiding behind curtains.' 

He added that despite being well educated, his daughter has been unable to sit her exams due to the fluorescent lighting in exam halls. 

'She's really bright but it means she has minimal chances of employment, as well as her being asleep all day and awake all night,' he said

Autumn's family has now begun fundraising to try and help Autumn lead a normal life.

'Until now we've worked extremely hard to do support our daughter on our own,' her father said.

'But being self-employed is tough sometimes and we can't afford the small things that would make a huge difference to Autumn's life.

'We would like to get UV films for the windows so we can all look outside and know she's safe.

'Even UV safe clothing would mean she could go outside in the day when her friends are out.

'There are a number of things that could help.

'Despite all of this though Autumn is brilliant, she always puts other first, she even donated her hair to The Little Princess Trust last year.

'We are so proud of her, we just want to do everything we can to help her.'
