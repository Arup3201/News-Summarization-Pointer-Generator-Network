Commons Speaker John Bercow has been criticised after it emerged he charged taxpayers £1,300 to attend an MP’s funeral.

Mr Bercow was one of a host of MPs at the Manchester service for popular Labour backbencher Paul Goggins who collapsed and died while out running in January.

He charged £239.10 for a return train journey to Manchester for him and two staff, plus £112.50 for a car from Parliament to Euston station and back the next day.

Taxpayers also picked up the £500 tab for him to ‘travel around Manchester’ by car - as well as £364.28 for him and his two staff to stay at city centre hotel, the Park Inn by Radisson. The total bill was £1,290.

The funeral expense revelation, exposed by the Sun today, is not the first time Mr Bercow has been criticised over his expense claims.

Last year MailOnline revealed he had run up a £100,000 bill in just three years on a taxpayer-funded tour of Britain and the world.

Details of the huge costs included jetting off to almost 20 countries, trips to have his portrait painted and an official car to take him just one mile up the road to tour the offices of the MPs' expenses watchdog.

The revelations sparked a furious response from MPs.

Details of the Speaker’s travel costs since the general in May 2010 were obtained by MailOnline under Freedom of Information laws.

Total travel and accommodation bill comes to more than £96,000, including £16,000 for journeys in a chauffeur-driven car and flights for him and aides costing £63,000.

The huge sums are on top of £9,200 claimed by Mr Bercow on expenses in the last three years as the MP for Buckingham.

Mr Bercow was today accused of treating taxpayers with contempt over his lavish claims.

Dia Chakravarty, of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘This seems like an extraordinary bill for an overnight stay.’

Tory MP Rob Wilson told the Sun: ‘It is right that a Speaker should attend the funeral of a former MP.

‘That said, at first look, it seems extravagant to spend over £1,000 of taxpayers’ money.’

A spokeswoman for Mr Bercow said: ‘The Speaker, representing the House of Commons, attended a church service the evening before Mr Goggins’ funeral, as well as attending the funeral.

‘This was a mark of respect to Paul Goggins and to his family. The funeral was in Manchester, so travel costs from Westminster were incurred.’
