This fighting fit four-year-old was branded overweight following the results of a barmy health test.

Skinny Thomas Marston, of Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, was deemed fat by NHS bosses - despite weighing just 3st 4lbs - under the Government’s Change 4 Life campaign aimed at tackling child obesity.

The active youngster, who is 3ft 7ins tall, was also warned of the long term serious implications of his weight - including cancer and heart disease.

Mother Wendy Brinkworth, 30, was stunned 
when she got a letter from his school saying: 'You may be surprised your
child’s result is in the overweight range.

'It can sometimes be difficult to tell if your child is overweight as they may look similar to other children their age.

'Research shows that children who are overweight or very overweight have higher risk of ill health during childhood and later life.'

The furious mum-of-three has blasted the campaign and fears it could do more harm than good, leading to youngsters developing eating disorders like anorexia and bulimia.

She said: 'I was quite shocked.

'He is not overweight.

'He is a really active boy and eats healthily - he eats healthier that the rest of the family. He loves his fruit and veg.

'He gets up at 6am and eats an apple nearly every day.  He doesn’t really snack and when he does it is fruit or a yoghurt. He is one of those kids that is always on the go.

'He is really physical and always outside lifting things and helping his dad in the garden. He doesn’t sit playing computer games all day. He is outdoors and active. He is a little boy - it is absurd.'

Fit
as a fiddle Thomas is one of thousands of British children in reception
classes and year six having their height and weight taken to work out 
their body mass index (BMI).

His BMI was between 91 and 97 - putting him in the overweight category. Wendy, a self-employed beauty therapist, added: 'It is taking childhood away from children.

'I don’t want my children worrying about their weight - that is my job.

Explanation: The letter given to Thomas Marston explains how his body mass index of between 91 and 97 made him overweight

'I don’t think it is right, particularly at that age, to put that pressure on parents and children.

'They should let children be children.

'Obviously there are certain children that are extremely overweight but look at him.

'There is nothing wrong with him.

'He doesn’t have a big belly or big arms, just a big head.

'He is quite muscly and stocky.

'He is just a big boned strong lad.

'There’s no fat on him.

'He runs around like a headless chicken.

'It is hard enough getting children to eat.'

Wendy said her son is already ‘anxious’ about his weight and has salad, yoghurt, and fruit for his packed lunch.

She added: 'I have tried to keep it from him because he is quite concerned about that sort of thing.

'It could effect his self-esteem.

'I don’t think it is fair.

'There is too much concern all of a sudden on this from the NHS.

'It is over the top.'

An NHS Suffolk spokesman said: 'The National Child Weight Management Programme is part of a national initiative to tackle the problem of overweight and obese children, and informs parents of their child’s weight with possible underlying health conditions.

'In Suffolk we know that nearly a third of children are overweight or obese.

'Families are encouraged to take action to improve their lifestyle through the Alive N Kicking programme, which gives support and advice on eating more healthily and taking plenty of exercise.

'Tackling weight issues earlier in life will help prevent longer-term health conditions such as type 2 diabetes and heart disease, which reduce quality of life and life expectancy.'
