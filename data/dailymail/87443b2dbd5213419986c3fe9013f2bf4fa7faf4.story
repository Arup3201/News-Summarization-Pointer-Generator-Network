It's no secret that Australia is blessed with some of the most contemporary and breathtaking cities in the world. 

From Sydney's iconic harbour to Perth's bustling  bar scene and Hobart's undeniably beautiful scenery, there's somewhere to suit just about every city dweller.

But one city has taken out the top prize when it comes to the number one location Australians would most like to visit for a leisurely holiday.

Travel and lifestyle website lastminute.com.au surveyed over 4100 Australians and the majority of voters would pick the cobbled streets of Melbourne to explore over any other Australian city.

lastminute.com.au spokesperson, Louise Ryan says Melbourne is number one for many reasons beyond it's well known characteristics of culture and European style.

'Melbourne is best known as the cosmopolitan mecca of Australia, however, it's much more than that; it's an intoxicating mix of sophistication and guilty pleasures.

'It's the ultimate Aussie city to 'play up' in. Whether that is maxing the budget by shopping till you drop, late night espresso Martinis at an inner city rooftop bar, or lazy days drinking coffee and people watching in one of the city's hidden laneways,' Ms Ryan said.

With Australia's style, fashion and coffee capital Melbourne taking out the top spot, we took a look at the top five cities in Australia and the best of what they have to offer.

1. MELBOURNE 

Find your own in the bustling laneways and arcades of Melbourne, a city known for its rooftop bars, many of them hidden above discreet city buildings

Let’s be honest, Melbournians have an impeccable sense of style. Find your own in the bustling laneways and arcades of the city. Melbourne is a city known for its rooftop bars, many of them hidden above discreet city buildings. Some lastminute.com.au favourites include the retro tennis inspired Madame Brussels on Bourke Street, Naked In The Sky overlooking the ultra-cool Brunswick Street in Fitzroy and beachside Captain Baxters in St Kilda. Hit up hip inner city restaurants such as local favourites Chin Chin, Bomba, Tonka, Mamasita and Supernormal. If a long relaxing luncheon is your thing, take a day trip to the Yarra Valley wine region, just an hour north-east of Melbourne and enjoy local food and wine flavours in a relaxed vineyard setting. After a fun filled day, relax at any of the inner city hotels such as the world’s first dessert hotel Adelphi or live it up at the glamorous Crown Metropol Melbourne. Alternatively, if Melbourne’s inner city precincts are more to your taste, Art Series has a great selection of artist-inspired rooms at several chic properties.

2.  PERTH  

When Summer rolls around in Australia, there is nowhere better to be than on one of Perth's immaculate white sand beaches while the city is a sun-seekers's dream

When Summer rolls around in Australia, there is nowhere better to be than on one of Perth's immaculate white sand beaches. From City Beach to Cottesloe and further down towards Fremantle and Margaret River, the city is a sun-seekers's dream. After a hard day working on your tan, head to Hillary's Boat Harbour where you can enjoy oysters and cocktails at the Breakwater. Alternatively, the city's ever evolving bar scene is sure to throw out a few surprises, with the Print Hall, The Aviary and The Lucky Shag being some of our favourite locations to enjoy a tipple and some light snacks. If it's a night on the tiles you're after, Northbridge is the place to be. Lined with hopping nightclubs and fast-food eateries, Northbridge is a party animal's dream. Take a day trip to Rockingham where you can enjoy epic views of pristine water and swim with dolphins. Alternatively, spend your day cycling around Rottnest Island searching for quokkas and snorkelling. 

 3. HOBART  

Often forgotten by many Australians, Hobart offers up a world of unrivalled scenery and culture

Often forgotten by many Australians, Hobart offers up a world of unrivalled scenery and culture. Located at the entrance to the Derwent River, Hobart is an adventurers dream. Take a guided tour of Battery Point which is within walking distance of Hobart’s waterfront. Dive or take a tour of the summit of Mount Wellington for amazing views of the city. If it’s raining, try the nearby Mt Nelson Signal Station instead. Award winning restaurants line the streets with fresh produce oozing from the seafood cafes and eateries. A perfect trip for chocolate lovers would be a visit the Cadbury’s factory. On route, you will pass by landmarks and mountain ranges. Alternatively, you could sail away the hours, taking a sailing day trip around the peninsula. 

4. SYDNEY  

The world famous Sydney harbour is breathtaking in itself. Stop by the Opera Bar to take in the iconic Opera House and the mighty Sydney Harbour Bridge with a cool drink

Sydney's streets need no introduction. The world famous Sydney harbour is breathtaking in itself. Stop by the Opera Bar to take in the iconic Opera House and the mighty Sydney Harbour Bridge with a cool drink. If you have time, book yourself in for a place on the bridge climb. You will get unrivalled views of the magnificent harbour and even get in some exercise at the same time. Catch a boat from Circular Quay and visit Taranga Zoo. The giraffes have been known to have the best view in Sydney. The city definitely caters to tourists and what tourists don’t love  fireworks? Every Saturday night at Darling Harbour there is a pretty spectacular fireworks show which attracts an impressive crowd. While we all know about Sydney’s most famous beach at Bondi, venture further into the eastern suburbs and stop at Coogee Beach or Bronte. Coogee’s Pavillion bar and restaurant is the newest outdoor bar to take over the city and the rooftop views will not fail to impress. Alternatively take a stroll through Surry Hills or visit the market at Glebe.

5. DARWIN 

Filled with amazing water pools and refreshing waterfalls, this city is closer to Bali than it is to Bondi

The tropical climate of Darwin makes it one of the most attractive cities in Australia. Filled with amazing water pools and refreshing waterfalls, this city is closer to Bali than it is to Bondi. Sail across the harbour from Darwin to the Tiwi Islands, glide across wetlands and spot local wildlife, or cool off under a waterfall in Litchfield National Park. There are more crocodiles in the Northern Territory than anywhere else in the world, so jump in a boat or visit a park and meet the real locals. When it's time to relax, catch a movie in one of the twilight cinemas or watch the sunset at the world famous Mindil Beach. Market stalls are huge in Darwin and are where some of the best produce in Australia is sold. Pop into one of the stunning restaurants on the main strip and after dinner hit the party scene for some dancing.
