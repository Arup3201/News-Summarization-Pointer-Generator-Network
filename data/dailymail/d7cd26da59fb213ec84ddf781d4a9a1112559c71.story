We all know Britain’s weather is up and down, but the last few days of January will see it at its topsy-turvy best.

After the freezing temperatures of the last week, it’s going to get as warm as Spain.

Some of us might even venture out without a coat as bright sunshine helps temperatures climb to 10C (50F) from today.

But be warned, by the end of this week, you may be building a snowman or cursing traffic chaos caused by an icy whiteout.

The Met Office has issued a yellow weather alert ahead of the cold snap with wintry showers expected in northern England, Scotland and Northern Ireland on Wednesday and Thursday.

The warning urges drivers to be safe on the roads and to be prepared for possible weather-related delays. 

Some areas could see snow of up to 2in on low levels and more than 4in on higher ground. By the weekend, temperatures will again dip below zero.

The Met Office has issued a 'level two' cold weather alert, which warns of an 80 per cent chance of severe weather between Wednesday and Sunday. 

John Lee, a forecaster at MeteoGroup, said: ‘There is a definite trend for it getting colder as the week goes on.

'There will be an increased risk of snow towards the end of the week. 

'We will already see wintry showers from Wednesday in some parts of the country. 

‘By the weekend there is a risk of snow anywhere. It will definitely be cold enough.’ 

The predicted snow at the end of the week combined with strong winds could mean reduced visibility for drivers.

The Met Office said: ‘An active cold front is expected to push south-east across the UK during Wednesday introducing an increasingly cold and unstable air mass.

‘Showers will become frequent and heavy, increasingly falling as snow in the North and West, and driven well inland by strong to gale force north-westerly winds. Accumulating snow is likely, especially overnight.’

People have been advised to stay indoors and look out for friends and family who may be vulnerable to the cold as the chill factor sets in because of northerly winds.

Dr Angie Bone, head of extreme events team at Public Health England, said: ‘Although many parts of the country have already seen colder weather this winter, it does look like we're in for a further spell with bitter winds and snow showers likely to make it feel particularly cold.

‘In this sort of weather we know that older people and people in poor health tend to stay indoors.

‘While this is sensible, it's worth remembering these people may need help getting to a hospital or GP appointment, with shopping or prescription fetching, or just someone to talk to.

‘If you know someone in this situation, and most of us do, think about what you can you do to help out.

‘Contrary to popular belief, it's actually working age adults who have most slips and trips outside in cold and icy weather, not older people, which is why it's important to wear shoes with a good, slip-resistant grip to prevent any accidental falls.

Peaceful: Despite the chilly weather and snowfall in some northern regions, there were some spells of sunshine across Cambridge yesterday

Cosy: One group made the most of a red, fluffy blanket to keep warm as they enjoyed their tour of Cambridge along the famous River Cam

‘Although most of our advice on keeping warm and well in cold weather may seem like common sense, it's important to remember that cold kills, even in places where the temperatures aren't at their lowest.’ 

The drop will be a sharp contrast to the mild temperatures of around 10C (50F) – the same as those predicted for Madrid – at the beginning of this week.

On Wednesday night many will begin to feel the cold again with temperatures falling to -2C in the North and -1C in the South.

In the North, sleet and snow are expected to cover the ground overnight with wintry showers and winds blasting the South.

Despite the cold snap, nature experts say spring is already well on the way. 

Sightings of snowdrops, hazel catkins and even ladybirds and butterflies have been submitted to the Woodland Trust’s Nature’s Calendar scheme, which asks the public to report natural events which mark the changing seasons.  

Wake up call: This man appeared rather refreshed after joining swimmers who took to the sea off Brighton yesterday for an early morning dip

So far in 2015, there have been reports of snowdrops at 120 locations across the country and hazel catkins in 74 areas.

In November, the Trust received a record of frogspawn on the Lizard Peninsula, Cornwall, the earliest such incidence for nine years.

Research looking at nature records stretching back to the 18th century has found flowers over the last 25 years blooming up to 12 days earlier than previously.

This year’s sightings come after the warmest year on record for the UK. 

The current freezing conditions may halt the march of spring, but conservationists say that causes less of a problem than a late cold snap, as happened in 2013, when more species are likely to be awake from hibernation or already flowering.

Today : Overnight rain will clear away south-eastwards during the morning. There will then be sunny intervals but a good deal of cloud too for most with also wintry showers in western Scotland, northern England and northern Wales. The best of the sunshine should be in eastern areas of England and Scotland. Rather windy in northern areas of Scotland with a moderate to fresh westerly wind.

Tuesday: Grey skies with outbreaks of light rain or drizzle in northern areas. Largely dry elsewhere but with a good deal of cloud in many areas. Southern areas of England will see sunny spells for a time.

Wednesday: Turning very unsettled, windy and wet with heavy showers or longer spells of rain. The showers will turn increasingly wintry as the day progresses with the risk of hail and thunder in the North West.
