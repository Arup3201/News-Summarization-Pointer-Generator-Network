Estadio Mineirao represented Dante's very own circle of hell in Belo Horizonte, as his Bayern Munich team-mates ran riot during Germany’s crushing victory over Brazil.

The centre-back, who was standing in for suspended captain Thiago Silva, will dread returning to Bavaria for pre-season after Germany’s Bayern contingent - particularly Thomas Muller and Toni Kroos - tore through Luiz Felipe Scolari’s side, who were also without star forward Neymar.

Below, Sportsmail takes a closer look at where and when it all went wrong for Dante and his team-mates against Joachim Low’s ruthless team...

Crestfallen: The Brazilian could do nothing as Germany swept past their opponents at will

8mins - Dante shepherds Muller away from goal well after the German received the ball on the right-hand side. It was the second time in quick succession Muller lost the ball, having been tackled by Oscar on the halfway line not long before.

9mins - Marcelo nicks the ball from Muller on the edge of the Brazil box and the German resorts to a cynical foul to stop Brazil breaking, by pulling on the Real Madrid full-back's shirt.

11mins - GOAL: BRAZIL 0-1 GERMANY - After a poor start Muller notches his fifth goal of the tournament, sweeping home at the back post after a corner from Kroos was allowed to bounce all the way through to him. David Luiz, who was supposed to be marking him, was nowhere to be seen.

14mins - Having begun the game terribly Muller has burst to life, scoring the opening goal and then winning a couple of free-kicks by drawing fouls from Brazil's defenders.

23mins - GOAL: BRAZIL 0-2 GERMANY - Klose nets his 16th World Cup goal to double the Germans' lead. Dante was partly to blame in the build-up, as he raced out of defence to try and dispossess Kroos.

24mins - GOAL: BRAZIL 0-3 GERMANY – This one was made on the Bayern training ground. Lahm whipped a teasing ball across the box that Muller missed but Kroos was there, waiting at the edge of the box, to ping a fierce effort past Cesar with his left foot. 

Record-breaker: Klose surpassed Ronaldo's tally of 15 with his calm finish in the first half

Record-breaker: Klose's calm finish made him the all-time top goalscorer in World Cup tournaments

Disbelief: Bayern midfielder Kroos cannot believe the scoreline after making it 3-0 to Germany

26mins - GOAL: BRAZIL 0-4 GERMANY – Khedira robs Fernandinho of possession 35 yards from Brazil's and draws Cesar and Dante out of position before cutting it back to his midfield team-mate Kroos, who calmly slots a finish into the bottom left corner for his second of the game.

29mins - GOAL: BRAZIL 0-5 GERMANY - Dante is left to defend against three Germany players after Brazil's stand-in skipper Luiz goes haring out of defence with not a care in the world. Khedira is the man who gets Germany's fifth, after Ozil and Klose work the ball cleverly to him in space inside the box.

Composure: Kroos slides home to make it 4-0 to Germany in the 26th minute in Belo Horizonte

HALF-TIME: BRAZIL 0-5 GERMANY – The pre-tournament favourites are booed off at the break by their own fans after an abject half that saw them ship five goals in the space of 18 minutes.

Brazil’s defence was all over the place without suspended skipper Silva, with Luiz in particular at fault on a number of occasions.

Bayern provided three of Germany’s goals, with Kroos netting twice and Muller grabbing his fifth of the tournament.

51mins – Brazil force Neuer into a string of impressive stops, as Ramires, Oscar and Paulinho pepper the Germany goal at the start of the second half. The Bayern goalkeeper, so impressive throughout this tournament, stands firm, parrying each of their efforts away to safety. 

61mins – Only a brilliant save by Cesar keeps out Muller's rising strike from 15 yards as Germany look to increase their already emphatic lead.

Forced into action: Neuer stops Paulinho from grabbing a goal back for Brazil on the hour-mark

Distribution: The Bayern shotstopper performed well when called upon in Belo Horizonte

Booking: Dante was booked for a late challenge on Muller in the second half

68mins – Dante picks up the first booking of the game for a foul on Muller after the Germany forward had moved the ball quickly to a team-mate with his back to the Brazil goal.

69mins – GOAL: BRAZIL 0-6 GERMANY – Lahm grabs his second assist of the game after being afforded far too much space inside the Brazil box. He pulls a pass back to the onrushing Andre Schurrle, who makes no mistake from close range.

79mins – GOAL: BRAZIL 0-7 GERMANY – It’s Schurrle again! The Chelsea forward grabs his second of the evening with a thumping finish in off the crossbar from a tight angle on the left side of the penalty area.

Hit for six: Schurrle scores from close range shortly after being introduced in the second half for Germany

Seventh heaven: He then added another with 11 minutes left, crashing a left foot shot in off the crossbar

How many more? Dante looks on after Schurrle made it 7-0 to Low's side in the 79th minute

90mins - GOAL: BRAZIL 1-7 GERMANY - Oscar scores a consolation goal for the hosts after cutting inside and calmly finishing past Neuer.

FULL-TIME: BRAZIL 1-7 GERMANY - Joachim Low's team brought Brazil's unbeaten run of 62 competitive home games to a crushing end as the hosts fell apart without their captain Thiago Silva and talismanic forward Neymar.

In the middle of the rout Miroslav Klose broke Brazil legend Ronaldo's all-time World Cup goalscoring record of 15, while Bayern Munich players Toni Kroos and Thomas Muller shone throughout.

Bayern full-back Phillip Lahm set up two of Germany's seven goals, while Manuel Neuer made a handful of strong stops after the break.

Brazil crash out, while Germany await the winners of Wednesday's semi-final between Holland and Argentina.
