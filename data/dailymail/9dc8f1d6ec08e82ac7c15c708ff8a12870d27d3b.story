A Mother-to-be died after trainee surgeons took out an ovary instead of her appendix in a weekend operation.

Maria De Jesus was five months  pregnant when she was admitted to hospital with serious abdominal pain.

Doctors correctly diagnosed appendicitis only to remove the wrong organ on the operating table.

They discharged their 32-year-old 
patient from hospital but – two weeks after the initial operation – 
readmitted her because she was still in great pain.

Maria De Jesus, 32, pregnant with the the baby she miscarried days before she died of multiple organ failure. She was suffering from appendicitis but unsupervised trainee surgeons removed one of her ovaries by mistake

By now, a pathology report revealing 
the failure to remove her dangerously inflamed appendix had been 
available for a week. Yet, incredibly, doctors had not read it.

They only looked at the report, and realised their mistake, two days later – when Mrs De Jesus had a miscarriage.

By now she was suffering sepsis, a severe blood infection caused by the untreated appendicitis.

She had an emergency operation to 
remove septic fluid but died 48 hours later on the operating table when 
surgeons finally removed her appendix. She had suffered major organ 
failure.

Yesterday her husband Adelino said a 
‘litany of errors’ had been made during his wife’s treatment and he 
planned to take legal action against Queen’s Hospital in Romford, East 
London.

‘My wife’s death could have been 
prevented, I am sure of it,’ said the 53-year-old. ‘By the time they 
realised how serious the situation was – and they promised us all the 
best consultants – it was too late.

‘This is neglect, this is an unlawful 
killing. If my wife had been given treatment by fully qualified staff 
and people were informed of the mistake earlier she could still be 
alive.

‘She went to hospital with stomach pains and we were told she needed to have her appendix out.

‘She had the operation, and left 
hospital eight days later, but the pain continued. We wouldn’t have ever
 imagined what they had done.’

Mrs De Jesus' condition failed to improve after the mistake was noticed and she died on the operating table at Queens Hospital, Romford (pictured) after medics finally removed her appendix - 19 days after the wrong procedure. She had developed severe sepsis as a result of the appendicitis

At an inquest last week, coroner 
Chinyere Inyama spoke of a ‘lost window of opportunity’ that could have 
saved Mrs De Jesus’s life.

The hearing in Walthamstow, North-East
 London, was told the operation was carried out on Sunday, October 23, 
2011, by two trainee surgeons without the supervision of a consultant.

Eight days later tests showed they had
 bungled but it was not until November 9 – and when Mrs De Jesus had 
been back in their care for two more days – that doctors read the report
 and realised the appendix had not been dealt with.

Dr Sunita Sharma told the hearing she 
examined the pathology results because she was ‘puzzled’ that Mrs De 
Jesus was still in pain.

‘It didn’t make sense that a healthy 
young woman with appendicitis wasn’t recovering after the appendix had 
been removed,’ she said.

‘I looked at the results and it showed
 that her ovary had been removed and not her appendix. I could not 
believe it, I was shocked.’ Barking, Havering and Redbridge Hospital 
Trust has admitted liability for Mrs De Jesus’s death on November 11, 
2011.

Chief executive Averil Dongworth said:
 ‘The trust fully accepts the inquest verdict. I would once again like 
to apologise unreservedly to Mrs De Jesus’s family for their loss.

‘We have admitted liability in this case. The staff involved in Mrs De Jesus’s care have been deeply affected by her death.

‘An extensive trust-wide action plan 
was drawn up following Mrs De Jesus’s death in 2011 to ensure that such a
 tragic incident will not happen again.

‘We have kept Mrs De Jesus’s family 
fully informed about the investigation into her death and the subsequent
 wide-ranging work which has taken place to improve systems and patient 
safety.’

Liability: Mrs de Jesus's husband said 'My wife could still be alive'

The General Medical Council is 
investigating eight hospital staff, including senior surgical consultant
 Dr Babatunde Coker over the case.

Mrs De Jesus, a teaching assistant from Dagenham, East London, would have been 34 this month.

Her daughter Catarina, ten, said: ‘We 
have put the balloons up because it was mum’s birthday and it’s good to 
celebrate it.’ Her son Pedro, 16, said: ‘It feels like such a big 
injustice.’

The coroner recorded a narrative verdict.

Shocking findings published last month
 revealed that patients who have planned operations at the weekend 
rather than a Monday are 82 per cent more likely to die.

Researchers from Imperial College 
London looked at four million elective operations in NHS hospitals in 
England between 2008 and 2011 with at least one night spent in hospital.

Elective surgery normally involves 
procedures such as heart bypass, hip and knee replacements, gastric 
operations and hysterectomies. Altogether 27,500 patients died within 30
 days of surgery, with the risk lowest for those having it on Monday and
 rising on each subsequent day of the week.

The extra risk on Tuesday was minimal,
 but went up to 15 per cent on Wednesday, 21 per cent for Thursday 
patients and 44 per cent on Friday – all compared with Monday. Almost 
one in 20 operations was performed at a weekend, when the increased risk
 reached 82 per cent, said the study published online at bmj.com.

Further pressure on hospitals at 
weekends has come from patients flooding casualty units because of the 
problems accessing out-of-hours GP care.
