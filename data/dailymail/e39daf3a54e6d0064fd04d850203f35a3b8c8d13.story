Jailed Pussy Riot singer Nadia Tolokonnikova dramatically ended her hunger strike yesterday after Russian officials promised she could move to another prison.

The 23-year-old anti-Vladimir Putin campaigner was rapidly deteriorating when she agreed to eat her first food in nine days.

Human rights ombudsman Vladimir Lukin said Tolokonnikova had been assured her demands would be met after she wrote an open complaint alleging a threat to her life by a senior jailer, and 'slave labour conditions' in her penal colony.

'We agreed that she would end her strike, and that the prison service would treat with understanding her request to be moved to a different correctional facility,' he said.Â 

Agreement: Pussy Riot punk band member Nadia Tolokonnikova, 23, has agreed to end her nine day hunger strike on the condition she is moved to a new jail

She and fellow band member Maria Alyokhina were jailed for two years in August 2012, after being found guilty of 'hooliganism motivated by religious hatred' over a protest against the Kremlin strongman in a Moscow cathedral.

MP and human rights campaigner Ilya Ponomaryov, who yesterday visited her in Penal Colony No. 14 in Mordovia region, said she had 'stopped her hunger strike for medical reasons'.

The prisoner's husband Pyotr Verzilov said she was in a stable condition but vowed she would restart her hunger strike if she was not moved to a new prison.

The prison camps in Mordovia are remnants of Stalin's gulag labour camps.

In an open letter, Tolokonnikova complained of 17 hour days in sewing workshops making uniforms, with humiliating punishments, officially-sanctioned bullying, and filthy sanitary conditions.

One of her lawyers yesterday filed a complaint about the conditions at her prison to the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights.

'The situation in which Ms Tolokonnikova finds herself in the correctional colony no. 14 in Mordovia, Russia constitutes one of the abhorrent contemporary 'slave-like' practices,' lawyer Sergei Golubok wrote in English.

Tolokonnikova's open letter ignited a fresh debate about filthy jail conditions and prisoner abuse in Russia.

Rights activists have for years sounded the alarm over prison conditions in modern Russia, but few complaints from female jails have previously been made public due to what activists describe as a culture of violence and intimidation.

Several prominent figures called on the young mother to stop her protest.

'Unfortunately, our society only reacts to extreme situations,' veteran rights activist Lyudmila Alexeyeva said on Moscow Echo radio.

Pressure: Supporters of Pussy Riot have attempted to apply pressure on the Russian government to release the jailed members

In April, Tolokonnikova appeared before a court to argue for her prison sentence to be suspended or reduced.

The labour camp where she has been held for more than a year argued against her release.It said she was 'decisive, insensitive to ethics and conscience and thinking only about herself' and also reports that she once failed to greet a prison official during a hospital stay.

One of the three Pussy Riot women jailed for hooliganism, Yekaterina Samutsevich, had her sentence suspended on appeal.

Russia law does not make repentance a condition for an early release but the court is supposed to take into account the convict's behaviour in jail.

The prison colony listed a penalty that Tolokonnikova received for failing to say hello to a prison official while she was in hospital and was once reprimanded for her refusal to go out for a walk while she was held in a Moscow jail.
