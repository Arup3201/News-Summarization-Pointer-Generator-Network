Argentinian bombshell, Luisana Lopilato, 26, looks stunning in Ultimo's new campaign shots. The model, who is married to singer Michael Bublé, gave birth to a son, Noah, on August 27.

New mums will be relieved to know she hasn't sprung back into shape in a record three weeks - these pictures, for Ultimo's AW13 collection, were actually taken months ago.

Ultimo recently celebrated its 14th birthday, and show no signs of slowing down with a show-stopping new range.

Priced from £10 for briefs and £20 for 
bras, the new Ultimo line features wintery, jewel shades and 
sophisticated statement detailing.

Luisana became a mother for the first time last month.

She and her husband Michael, 37, welcomed son Noah into the world after the 26-year-old beauty gave birth in the early hours of the morning of 27 August in Vancouver, Canada.

And the singer wasted no time announcing the news, posting a picture straight from the delivery room of the happy couple and their newborn baby in the hospital.

He wrote: 'Overjoyed and filled with gratitude at the arrival of our son.'
