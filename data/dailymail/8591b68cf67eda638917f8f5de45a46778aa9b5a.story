Angry locals in a small outback town today questioned the motives of British teenager Sam Woodhead who set out for a desert run and then had to be rescued.

Mr Woodhead, 18, was lost in the outback for three days after setting out for a late afternoon run last week and was just a few hours from dying when rescued by a helicopter crew.

And while residents of the town of Longreach are delighted that he was found and is now recovering in Brisbane with his mother, Claire, they were critical today of his motives when he set out for the ill fated run.

'Life-threatening': Sam Woodhead was reunited with his mother Claire Derry in Longreach, Queensland, when he was rescued after spending three days missing in the Australian outback

'Just a few things don't add up,' said Norman Philp, who had been involved in other outback rescues. 'You get a feeling he wanted to go bush.'

Mr Woodhead's mother and his family in the UK have already said that the teenager is a Bear Grylls fan and wanted to go into the Marines.

Survival expert Bob Cooper told Brisbane’s Courier Mail that visitors must be told that the outback is life-threatening – and that there are rarely any second chances.

He said local people should try to ensure that visitors to the outback are warned of the dangers.

‘We need ourselves to be more responsible in our attitude to visitors and visitors to the outback, whether they’re from the city or overseas,’ he said.

‘They make it into a challenge and it’s more than that. It’s not challenging – it’s life-threatening.’

Mr Philp and Mr Cooper are among Queensland residents who have questioned whether Mr Woodhead had deliberately set out to challenge his endurance when he left the Upshot cattle station where he had been staying for the previous 10 days.

When he jogged off in his shorts and running shoes, he was also wearing a backpack containing clothes.

He said after his rescue that he had been using the bag to add weight to his body while he was on his jog – a run, he said, that was ‘just a run that went wrong.’

He has already told how he became lost and after drinking all the water from a bottle he had carried he resorted to drinking small bottles of contact lens solution he had in his backpack. He had also tried drinking his own urine.

The run, he had chosen, he said, had seemed more interesting than running around the small airfield that he had been going around on previous days.

Local resident Adrian Roots has joined several others in questioning Mr Woodhead’s motives.

‘From what his mum told us about him wanting to be in the Royal Marines and being a big fan of Bear Grylls, that’s probably why people are angry, thinking that’s what he was doing,’ Mr Roots told the newspaper.

‘There’s just the unanswered questions.’

Lloyd Mills, who is based in Longreach as the general manager for Outback Queensland Tourism, said it was the responsibility of tourists to research the dangers of the outback.
