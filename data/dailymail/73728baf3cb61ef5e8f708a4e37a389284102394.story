A wind-up iPhone case that can charge a phone simply by spinning a handle on the back could spell the end of 'battery anxiety'.

Designers claim the Ampware CrankCase can provide up to three hours of power by winding the handle for just five minutes.

It also includes a USB port that allows users to charge accessories, or a friend's mobile phone.

The Ampware Crankcase (shown above) will be available for the iPhone 5, 5S and 6 models.Designers claim it can provide up to three hours of power by winding the handle for just five minutes

Mark Gabriel, co-founder of Ampware who is based in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, said he was inspired to develop the device after being separated from his family by Hurricane Katrina in 2005.

He said: 'I realised that without access to power, there was no way I could stay in touch with my friends and family.

'With millions of people facing the same issue during events like Katrina, and more recently during Hurricane Sandy, I knew there had to be a way to keep people connected regardless of access to a traditional power source.

'CrankCase leverages existing technology in a new way to generate power to keep mobile devices charged without having to depend on traditional power outlets.'

CrankCase uses a magnetic dynamo generator to produce  power. Designer Mark Gabriel said he was inspired to develop the device after being separated from his family by Hurricane Katrina in 2005.

The handle on the back of the case can also be used as a support to prop up the phone for watching videos. Mr Gabriel has  launched a campaign on Indiegogo to help fund development of the case. The team plans to begin shipping the device, which costs $59 (£39.50), in October 2015

 Apple has said that the 'all day' battery in its new Watch lasts 18 hours with 'typical use'.

However official tests have revealed this equates to just 90 time checks, 90 notifications, three hours of talk time and 6.5 hours of music playback. 

Music can be played via apps on the Watch when connected to a phone, and this can be done either using the timepiece's built-in speaker or via Bluetooth headphones. 

Apple defines the battery on its Watch product page and said a time check typically lasts four seconds. It is likely that a notification illuminates the screen for a similar time. 

This means 90 time checks and 90 notifications equate to 12 hours of screen activity. When this is added to app use and workout time the total usage is 13 hours and 15 minutes. 

This leaves 4 hours and 45 minutes on standby. 

When used just as a watch, Apple said the device will last 48 hours if checked  five times an hour.

CrankCase uses a magnetic dynamo generator to produce the power needed to charge the phone.

This uses a rare earth metal spinning inside a magentic field to generate electrical current inside a coil of wire spun around the magnet.

Mr Gabriel said that spinning the handle on the back of the case for one minute can provide enough battery life for 40 minutes of standby use for an iPhone, and 20 minutes for an iPad mini.

He has now launched a  campaign on Indiegogo to help develop commercial products from the prototype he and his colleagues have created.

They plan to begin shipping the device, which costs $59 (£39.50), in October 2015.

A USB port in the CrankCase also allows other devices or accessories to be charged using the handle (above)

The handle of the case can be folded away when it is not in use so that it can be slipped easily into a pocket
