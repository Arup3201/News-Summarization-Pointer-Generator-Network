Jerry Hall poised to step out on the catwalk in 1995, Catherine Deneuve captured during a glamorous front row moment in 1988 and a dapper Yves Saint Laurent in a dicky bow surrounded by an array of striking models.

These are just a few of the dazzling images in a new book about the legendary Yves Saint Laurent.

The book is packed with photographs of the famous designer and his world of fashion, shot by New York-based fashion photographer Roxanne Lowit, a pioneer of backstage fashion photography.

YSL’s muses and admirers including Jerry Hall, Grace Jones, Paloma Picasso and Catherine Deneuve have also contributed to the book with their personal tributes to the king of fashion.

'I had barely left Texas when I found myself modelling haute couture for Yves Saint Laurent,' writes Jerry Hall.

'It was the beginning of a great relationship. I count my lucky stars I was able to work with him for so many years.

'I might have been too exotic for Texas, but not too exotic to be the Opium girl for eight years, starting when Yves Saint Laurent launched the perfume in 1977,' she says.

The model adds: 'Yves was a darling, gentle man, who always wanted everyone around him to be happy!' 

Screen legend Catherine Deneuve writes: 'I suppose I am not the first to say he was very shy.'

She says: 'Sometimes his shyness was innocent, like a child's, and like a child he liked having fun.

'When he designed something specifically for me they were always elegant and sophisticated clothes. Very feminine.'

As the tributes attest, few couturiers were as influential as Yves Saint Laurent. He pioneered ready-to-wear and draw inspiration from diverse cultures and contexts. He was a master at telling new stories through his designs.

Roxanne Lowit photographs and celebrity tributes create a glittering portrait of YSL

The designer made a lasting impression on the world of fashion and the people within it - not least photographer Roxanne Lowit.

Roxanne Lowit's book 'Yves Saint Laurent' is a personal photographic history of the legend from 1978, the year Lowit first met him, to the last show he gave in 2002.

Whether surrounded by beautiful models or peeking at the catwalk from the wings, Lowit says every moment with Yves Saint Laurent was a magnificent photo opportunity.

The book comes ahead of a biopic, due out this November.

Roxanne Lowit started taking pictures in the 1970s. 

Before long she was covering all the designers in Paris, where her friends, including models such as Jerry Hall, would sneak her backstage.

Her photographs have appeared in many magazines, including Vogue, Vanity Fair, Elle, and Glamour.

She has also worked on advertising campaigns for, among others, Dior, Barney’s and Vivienne Westwood.

Yves Saint Laurent by Roxanne Lowit  (Thames & Hudson), £29.95 is out on 27 October
