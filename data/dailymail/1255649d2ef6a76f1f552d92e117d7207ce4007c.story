The parents of a four-year-old with a fatal degenerative illness are desperately trying to raise enough money for a clinical trial into a potential cure.

Eliza O'Neill, from South Carolina, has Sanfilippo Syndrome Type A, which means she will stop speaking in about six months time.

She will then lose the ability to walk and look after herself and she is unlikely to survive into her teens.

Eliza O'Neill, four, has a rare degenerative condition which will soon leave her unable to speak or walk unless a cure can be found in the next six month

However, she is currently healthy and a hospital has a potential cure for her illness.

But, there is no money to pay for the treatment to be produced and trialled.

As a result, Eliza's parents, Glenn, 41, and Cara, 39, are trying to raise the necessary $1 million before it is too late to save their daughter.

On the fundraising video, which has gone viral, Mr O'Neill says: 'You know where it's heading - it's heading towards suffering, it's headed towards pain for her and as a father you want to be able to protect your children.

'This trial really is the only chance she has.'

Eliza seemed completely health for the first two or three years of her life but then her parents and teachers began to notice her development was slightly delayed.

Glenn and Cara O'Neill have raised more than half a million dollars in the past two weeks thanks to a viral video which helps explain their plight of their 4-year-old daughter Eliza. They are pictured with Eliza and her older brother, Beckham

Until Eliza was about three, she was thought to be perfectly health. She was only diagnosed after starting to show signs of developmental delay. Currently she is healthy but will soon start to deteriorate

They thought she might have autism or a mild learning disability.

However, a geneticist friend of Mrs O'Neill suggested that it was worth having a genetic test done just in case.

Sanfilippo Syndrome is a metabolism disorder which is passed down through families.

It occurs when the enzymes that are needed to break down heparan sulfate sugar chains are missing or defective.

This causes the toxic substance to build up in the body and brain.

Sufferers are initially healthy but start to show signs of a decline in learning ability between the ages of two and six.

They then slowly deteriorate and those with Type A - the most severe form - often do not survive into their teens.

Children can only inherit the condition if both of their parents are carriers - in that situation, the child has a 25 per cent chance of being a sufferer.

Mr and Mrs O'Neill were so unconcerned at
 this stage that Mr O'Neill did not even attend the appointment when the
 results were given.

However, Mrs O'Neill, herself a paediatrician, was told the horrifying news that Eliza had Sanfilippo Syndrome.

She said: 'This is really bad, this is really bad.'

But she added: 'We don't just have hope, there is something very real that exists that with enough money will happen and will happen in time for our Eliza.

'It's not a question of if this can happen, this will happen.'

She explained that Nationwide Children's Hospital, in Ohio, has developed a treatment that is thought to be able to cure the illness.

The hospital is ready to go ahead with a clinical trial - which Eliza could be part of - but needs $1 million to fund it.

Children with Sanfilipo Syndrome have a mutation of a gene which allows for the production of an enzyme essential for normal cellular function.

Because the children lack this enzyme, over time a toxic material called heparan sulfate builds up in their brains and bodies leading to severe disability and death before they even reach their teens.

If Mr and Mrs O'Neill can raise enough money, Eliza could take part in the clinical trial which could mean a one-off treatment prevents her ever developing symptoms

The response to the Eliza video has surpassed her family's wildest expectations as news of their daughter's plight has spread around the globe

However, the hospital has developed a treatment which involves the child being given just one intravenous treatment.

They are given a substance that diffuses throughout the brain clearing the build up of heparan sulfate and preventing the development of symptoms.

The treatment also prevents further build up of the toxic substance meaning one treatment could be enough to prevent the child ever developing symptoms.

On learning about the treatment, Mr and Mrs O'Neill launched a fundraising campaign.

A Canadian photographer and filmmaker called Benjamin Von Wong heard about their plight and offered to help them by making a video about Eliza.

The video was released on YouTube on April 2 and has helped the family raise nearly $400,000 to date.

'We don't want to be two years from now and say as parents that we left anything on the table,' said Glenn O¿Neill about the plight of their young daughter

The money being raised is going towards trials to be run at the Nationwide Children's Hospital in Ohio

It has been viewed 140,000 times on YouTube since being posted.

Mr O'Neill told MailOnline: 'The comments we are getting from around the world are just amazing. The outpouring is just incredible.

‘It's unbelievable – we are completely overwhelmed with emotion. We could say thank you a million times over and it wouldn’t be enough. There are no words.’

He added: 'I was absolutely moved by the video but had no idea people are willing to help.

'It’s just people are good – they want to help.

'We are going to know by the end of the year whether this will work – it’s a miracle story in the making. If we can stop it, and stop it soon – wow.’
