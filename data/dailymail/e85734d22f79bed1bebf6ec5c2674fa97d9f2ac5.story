The mother of a 23-month-old baby boy who died from a heroin overdose has admitted playing a part in his death.

Daniel Jones was found dead at the family home in Wolverhampton in May last year. Tests later revealed that he died from a heroin overdose and his parents were arrested in December.

Today, Emma Bradburn, 33, pleaded guilty to causing or allowing his death at Wolverhampton Crown Court.

The child’s father, Simon Jones, 29, denied the same charge as he stood alongside her in the dock during the short hearing.

Both defendants pleaded not guilty to a separate charge of manslaughter in the case. They will stand trial later this year.

Paramedics were called to the couple’s house in Penn at 6.15am on May 29 last year.

After Daniel’s death it emerged an inquiry would be held by Wolverhampton social services, police and the Probation Service.

The Wolverhampton Safeguarding Children Board is carrying out the serious case review.

Concerns have been raised about how organisations or professionals worked together to protect Daniel.

Neighbours speaking when the news broke said Daniel’s death had been ‘devastating’.

At the time, Anthony Baker, 67, and daughter Natalie, 38, who lived next door, described Daniel as an 'ordinary child'.

Mr Baker added: 'I used to have a laugh with him over the fence.'

Miss Baker said: 'He was a normal happy child.'

Pictures from Jones' Facebook page showed a smiling Daniel in a car seat and the couple posing with him as a baby on a bed.

Previously, Penn ward councillor Martin Waite, who lives nearby, said: 'I’m massively surprised to hear that something like this has happened here. We have meetings with police every month and Penn is generally a low crime area.'

Jones and Bradburn were remanded in custody and will return for a plea and case management hearing charges on May 17.

They will be tried for manslaughter at Nottingham Crown Court in July.
