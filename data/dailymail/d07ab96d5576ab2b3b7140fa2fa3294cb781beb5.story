The father of the Indian diplomat at the center of a slave wage controversy has now accused the housekeeper of being a CIA mole.

Uttam Khobragade, a former bureaucrat, accused daughter Devyani's housekeeper of the espionage during a bizarre press conference Thursday in Mumbai.

Sources also confirmed the family's suspicions of maid Sangeeta Richard's spying to Mail Today hot on the heels of revelations she enjoyed working for Ms Kobragade.

Concerned: Uttam Khobragade, father of arrested Indian diplomat Devyani Khobragade, has accused her former housekeeper of being a CIA mole

Scapegoat: Mr Khobragade railed against the US government, saying the ordeal was a plot to ruin his daughter Devyani's reputation

The worried father told reporters gathered in the Indian capital that he believes Ms Richard's accusations are part of a plot to ruin his daughter.

'Going by the developments that have taken place over the last one year, the government of India feels that it appears to be a conspiracy,' Mr Khobragade said, according to the Economic Times.

'Also from the given circumstances, we suspect that Sangeeta Richards is an agent of the CIA,' he continued. 'We were made scapegoat in the whole case. Devyani is a brave woman and she has been performing all her duties regularly.

His comments just before sources told Mail Today the housekeeper was 'unusually curious during her stay with Devyani in the US.'

Ms Khobragade, 39, wasn't carrying any high-value information, sources said, but she was living at the Indian mission to the United Nations - where diplomats posted to both the Indian Consulate and the UN also stay.

The accuser could have been 'a live bug planted inside the residential building of India's mission to the UN,' sources suspect.

Many believe Ms Khobragade's 'ties to a senior diplomat,' as well as her mother's work for another diplomat, made her a prime target.

A spokesperson for Safe Horizon, the victim assistance agency working with Ms Richards, told the New York Daily News that his client is not a CIA agent.

This bizarre turn came after  a leaked letter home written by the disgruntled housekepper revealed her to have given her 
family in India a very different account of her life in New York to the 
one of ‘virtual slavery’ she has now alleged.

The
 letter was posted by diplomat Devyani Khobragade’s sister, Sharmistha, 
on her Facebook page as part of passionate defence of her sibling and 
rebuttal of the allegations leveled against her.It was written in December 2012, just one month after her arrival in New York.

Mrs Khobragade does not say how she came to possess the text in which Mrs Richard described the Khobragade family and Dr Khobragade in particular as ‘very nice.’

She wrote: ‘This family is very nice. I’m not feeling I’m her servant. Children call me “Thai” – that means elder brother’s wife. They call me Sangeeta Thai. Madam is very nice.

‘Every day she has a smile.’

Mrs Richard, 42, who is originally from Kerala, went onto claim that she received helped with her maid work allowing her ‘spare time’ and described the house into which the family were about to move: ‘Four bedroom, big sized and one big hall downstairs two rooms, upstairs two rooms.

‘My room is separate. Downstairs is lawn.’

She explained that until the family moved in their new home on the Upper East Side they were staying at The Beekman Tower Hotel and added: ‘Their window looks out at very nice buildings.’

She said that every day she prayed for her mother before going to sleep and promised to call and talk on Facebook ‘when master gives me a new SIM.’

'She ended the letter, written in Hindi, with the admission: ‘I am trying to talk in English but I can’t – I forget. So bad :) Sangeeta.’

Attorney Dana Sussman, is representing Sangeeta Richard, she says the real story of the alleged fraud has been lost in the diplomatic row

Earlier her mother-in-law Agnes, told the Indian Express, that Sangeeta had 'always wanted to work abroad.'

She said: 'I had reservations about the marriage but my son was in a hurry.'

The couple courted for three years before marrying. Agnes, claimed Mrs Richard left the marital home after just three days - returning only when she learned she was pregnant.

Following the birth of a daughter the couple moved to Fatehpur Beri in southwest Delhi.

Mrs Richard has not responded directly to the letter. 

But attorney Dana Sussman, who is representing her though the non-profit victim assistance agency Safe Horizon last night spoke of her ‘frustration and disappointment’ that focus had slipped from ‘crimes that were committed’ to ‘the criminal defendant.’

She pointed out that the case was about Dr Khobragade allegedly lying to the federal government about the wages she was paying Mrs Richard.

Mrs Richard has claimed she as paid just $3.31 an hour, below minium wage.

In a statement to the Press Trust of India Mrs Sussman said: ‘Dr Khobragade did not pay those wages, she grossly underpaid my client and required that my client work far more than she had expected.

‘My client worked for her for quite a while and eventually she decided she could not tolerate the situation any longer.’

She refused to comment on her clients and her family’s whereabouts. Mrs Richard’s husband Philip, and parents flew into America two days before police swooped on Dr Khobragade and arresting her at the gates of her daughter’s Upper East Side school.

Since then the case has escalated to a state of international crisis.  News that a female diplomat had been strip-searched and held in a cell with drug addicts and sex workers before posting bail of $250,000 incensed the Indian government and public.

US diplomats in India swiftly found many of their privileges rescinded and safety barriers removed from their embassy in New Delhi.

Secretary of State John Kerry expressed his ‘regret as well as his concern’ over the incident in a telephone call to Indian National Security Advisor Shivshanker Menon. He spoke of his hope that the ‘close and vital relationship with India’ remain unharmed.

But nothing short of dropping the charges – one count of Visa Fraud one of False Statement – against Dr Khobragade seems likely to satisfy Indian authorities in the case which has now been raised in the nation’s parliament.

Against this backdrop Mrs Sussman’s statement continued: ‘Mrs Richard is not on trial here and we think that the message here has been lost in the fact that there are charges against Khobragade for violating US law and those charges relate to the underpayment of wages to a domestic worker.

‘That is the story that has been lost in the diplomatic row that has erupted between US and India.’
