A retired Wisconsin sheriff's deputy accused of murdering his wife and her sister appeared in court and plead not guilty to the crime, blaming it on the side effects from ALS.

Andrew Steele, 40, of Fitchburg, claims that the terminal disease - which he was diagnosed with in June - amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), affected his brain making him unable to obey the law.

Steele argued that he was not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect to first-degree intentional homicide charges because he could not resist impulses, according to TwinCities.com

The former cop spoke in court, briefly, for the first time since he was charged with first-degree intentional homicide for the murders of his wife, Ashlee Steele, 39, and her sister, Kacee Tollefsbol, 38, of Lake Elmo, at the Steele home in Fitchburg on August 22, 2014.

Tollefsbol called 911 and told a dispatcher that her brother-in-law had shot her before she died. 

Ashlee Steele, 39, was found shot in the head in the master bedroom and cops found Andrew Steele sitting in a laundry room with a pistol.

The former deputy had started the dryer and vented it back into the room and he had set up a grill loaded with hot charcoal in the room. 

The killings came just days after the victims and the suspect's friends took part in the ALS ice bucket challenge, raising $23,000 towards the ailing deputy's medical expenses. 

However, the motive for the slayings remains a mystery.

The sisters have left six children behind.

As he addressed the court, Steele's speech sounded slurred as he waived his right to review the statements of potential jurors claiming to be unable to serve during his three-week trial.

Around 15 jurors will be picked from 120 potential jurors for the trial which is scheduled to begin with jury selection on April 13. 

It will be a two-phase trial, the first to establish guilt, the second to decide whether he was legally responsible for his actions.

The dramatic case saw Steele wheeled into the courtroom by bailiffs at the start of a status conference before Circuit Judge Nicholas McNamara.

Challenge: His wife, Ashlee Steele spearheaded the effort to raise money for her husband dubbed 'Tough as Steele', posting videos of the ice bucket challenges on her Facebook account

Family: The couple, pictured, had two children, and had been together for 26 years

His lawyer, Jessa Nicholson, said that Steele can still walk and that his speech has been affected by his ALS, but that otherwise he was doing well. 

ALS does not affect the brains of most people who are diagnosed with the disease, but Nicholson said about 20 percent experience dementia.

Nicholson wrote that Steele has suffered damage to his hippocampus, the emotional center of the brain, causing poor impulse control and loss of memory. 

His frontal lobe was also damaged, which can cause loss of inhibition, personality changes and loss of the ability to conform his conduct to the law.

Steele will be back in court for what is expected to be an all-day motion hearing on March 27.
