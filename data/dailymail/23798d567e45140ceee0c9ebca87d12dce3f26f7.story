This talented pianist is going to be a tough act to follow the next time a traveller sits down at a public piano at Prague’s international airport.

Maan Hamadeh wowed a crowd of passengers when he put his own spin on Beethoven’s Für Elise and Celine Dion’s theme, My Heart Will Go On, from the film Titanic.

Hamadeh performed the Beethoven classic in several different styles, throwing down a gauntlet for airport musicians.

Bored-looking passengers perked up and looked away from their smartphones, tablets or books when Hamadeh began his impressive performance at Vaclav Havel Airport in the Czech Republic’s capital.

He brought smiles to their faces as they waited to board their flights, clearly relishing every moment in the spotlight.

Passengers filmed him as he switched styles and transitioned from a Beethoven medley into one of the most popular love songs in recent decades.

Hamadeh was met with applause and cheers when he finished his impromptu concert.

The nearly six-minute video, filmed by Rami El Ghosseini, has more than three million views on YouTube alone.

Hamadeh, from Lebanon, told the Beirut-based Daily Star newspaper that he has been playing piano for 21 years.

He said: ‘I spent 12 days in Europe without playing music, so I missed playing and became very excited about it.

‘While we were looking for the gate to board our next flight, my friend stopped me and he pointed toward a piano, and so like a baby who has found his mother after getting lost, I ran to it.’

He added: ‘First people where indifferent listening to a normal Für Elise version, but after I started with my remixes they were very engaged.’
