A girl of two died in a fire started by a young boy playing unsupervised with a cigarette lighter.

Libby-Jayne Hornsby and the boy were being looked after by other boys aged 12 and 15 while her mother was at a majorette marching band practice.

Kelly Hambrey, 25, had left eight disposable cigarette lighters scattered around the rented house in Conisbrough, South Yorkshire – which was not fitted with smoke alarms – last October.

Ms Hambrey had been practising with her majorette band when the fire started at around 7.20pm on October 17 last year.

Libby-Jane Hornsby died from smoke inhalation when a fire was started in her home in Conisbrough, South Yorkshire by another child playing with a lighter, an inquest heard

The inquest heard how a child picked up a lighter left around the house and started playing with it in the room where Libby slept. Within minutes, a fire started on the bed and the room went up in flames

Neighbour Gary Keeling described seeing flames hitting the roof of the property as he tried to save the girl

A teenager had been hired to babysit Libby.

The inquest heard there were five disposable cigarette lighters around the house, all within easy reach of children.

Another child - who cannot be named for legal reasons - picked up one of the lighters and started playing with it, the hearing in Doncaster was told.

Within minutes, a fire had started on the bed and the room was soon engulfed with flames and thick smoke.

A neighbour tried to save Libby, the inquest heard, but couldn't get close to the bedroom. The child received 70 per cent burns, but was killed by 'thick and noxious smoke'

A post-mortem examination carried out after the child's death revealed 70 per cent of Libby’s body had been burned in the fire - which experts believe would have burned at around 200 degrees Celsius.

But it was the 'thick and noxious' smoke from the fire which killed the infant.

A statement written by the teenage babysitter, who also cannot be named,  was read out in court.

He said he had been babysitting for the mother for around two months while she went to band practice.

Recalling the events leading up to the fire, the statement read: 'About 7.20pm [the child] ran downstairs and said there’s a fire.

'I ran upstairs, but couldn’t get close to the bedroom door. I could see flames hitting the roof so we ran outside and we heard a window crack.'

Two neighbours were alerted to what was happening, and emergency services were called.

Neighbour Gary Keeling tackled the blaze in a bid to save Libby, who was still trapped in the bedroom.

Giving evidence, Mr Keeling said he made three attempts to get to the bedroom but could not tackle the 'thick wall of smoke' and the heat.

He said: 'I could hear the burning; things cracking, things falling. But I could not see because of the smoke.

'Soot was falling down like snow on my bare flesh and it was quite painful.'

Emergency services arrived shortly after and firemen, using special breathing apparatus, managed to pull Libby out of the house.

She was immediately taken to Rotherham Hospital but could not be resuscitated.

Recording an accidental death as a result of smoke inhalation, Coroner Nicola Mundy said: 'Within the property there were a number of disposable lighters.

Investigators work at the scene shortly after the tragedy in October last year. Libby was rushed to hospital following the fire, but could not be saved by medics

'[The child] was playing with one of those lighters and in doing so caused the bed clothes to ignite.

'The fire took hold very fast. As well as intense heat, this also produced thick and acrid smoke.

'Attempts were made to get Libby from the bedroom but it wasn’t until emergency services arrived that they were able to get her out.'

Ms Mundy also raised concerns that there were no smoke alarms in the house and said she would write to the Chief Fire Officer’s Association about the fact there is no legislation which requires private landlords to provide the life-saving devices.
