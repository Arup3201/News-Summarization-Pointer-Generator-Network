Fashion forward: YSL have unveiled their new logo to accompany their rebranding as Saint Laurent Paris

As an exercise in rebranding it has not gone exactly according to plan.

And disgruntled fans of Yves Saint Laurent have not been afraid to let the luxury brand know just how upset they are.

Facebook users have taken to the social networking site to express their displeasure at YSL's new packaging logo since the company rebranded their ready-to-wear collection as Saint Laurent Paris.

The new packaging - simple white 
block font lettering reading Saint Laurent Paris on top of a black 
background' has ruffled some online feathers, with Facebook users 
slamming the design as 'boring', 'disrespectful' and 'a cheap 
knock-off'.

The luxury brand's new creative 
director Hedi Slimane decided on the makeover, swapping the company's 
iconic monochrome logo of interlocking YSL letters (that has been around
for more than half a century) with the fresh look.

And although the famous signature 
will remain unaltered on handbags, lipsticks and shoes, there is no 
certainty that it will continue to be used as widely.

Disparaging comments on YSL's Facebook page include
those from Albie Gonzalez ('BAD, BAD, BAD IDEA. Reminds me of the 
change to Christian Dior to DIOR... It takes from the integrity of the 
original creator and what the fans are used to!!'), and Cheryl Phillips:
'NoNoNoNoNoNoNoNo! Yves MUST stay in the logo!!!! The color and fonts 
are great but you are killing an iconic brand by excluding Yves.'

Elegant or boring? Yves Saint Laurent's new ready-to-wear logo has not pleased the brand's Facebook fans

Classic lines: YSL's interlocking lettering has always been popular

Others remark that the new image is 'boring', 'confusing', 'too Chanel-esque', 'ridiculously stupid', 'senseless' and 'disrespectful to Yves'.

There are fans, however, who disagree with the mass displeasure, expressing their admiration for the new design.

With one user commenting: 'LOVE! Yves would be proud' and 
another describing it as 'simplicity and elegant.'

One user comments that the new logo is set to be 'the Marmite of the fashion world' because of its ability to divide opinion.

Facebook fury: YSL fans have taken to the social networking site to comment on the brand's new logo

Yves Saint Laurent was founded by designer Yves Saint Laurent and his partner, Pierre Bergé in 1962, and the current logo was created by the graphic designer Cassandre.

Over the years it has become as recognisable as Chanel's interlocked Cs or Louis Vuitton's LV and the recent announcement that Yves would be eliminated has provoked outcry from a number of commentators.

'It's like when they changed Opal Fruits
to Starburst only 10 times worse,' British vintage clothing store Rokit
Tweeted, while style website Fashion156.com stated the new name 'sounds
like a chain of downmarket budget hotels'.

Paying tribute: The new house logo bears a strong similarity to the label's original branding from 1966

However a spokesperson for Slimane said 
he was drawing inspiration from 1966, when the ready-to-wear line was 
launched as Saint Laurent Rive Gauche.

Earlier this month it was announced that he would be moving the French label's design studio from Paris to his adoptive city of Los Angeles.

While fittings would still in Paris and YSL ateliers will continue to work from the label's Avenue George V offices.

Slimane
relocated to LA in 2007 after he left  Dior Homme to concentrate on art
and photography. While it is traditional for creative directors of 
French houses to live in Paris, Slimane follows in the footsteps of 
Phoebe Philo, who leads Paris-based Celine from London.

Saint Laurent died in 2008 and produced the label's last haute couture collection in 2002.
