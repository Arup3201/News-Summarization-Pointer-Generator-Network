Two out of three families are resorting to a ‘staycation’ this summer as the squeeze on household budgets makes foreign holidays unaffordable, a study has found.

The number of Britons holidaying in the UK rose from 35 per cent to 41 per cent between 2011 and 2012, and this year is expected to jump to 65 per cent.

The study found Cornwall had been overtaken as a staycation hotspot by London, Edinburgh and the Lake District.

London, with sights including St Paul's Cathedral, tops a new poll of where those holidaying at home want to go

The survey found 42 per cent of 
staycationers will holiday for one week this summer, 15 per cent for two
 weeks, and a third will have three short domestic breaks.

Those in Wolverhampton, Liverpool, 
Cardiff, Chelmsford and Manchester were most likely to stay in Britain, 
according to the study, commissioned by Travelodge.

The hotel chain says the staycation 
surge will boost the UK tourism industry by £3.3billion compared with 
last year, making it worth a total of £12billion.

However, a separate study published by Thomas Cook suggests Britain is not the cheap option many believe it to be.

It found that in the UK, a basket of 
typical holiday purchases – from a glass of wine to a meal and ice cream
 – costs £125.74, making it the second most expensive destination after 
Sydney, Australia, at £157.96.

However, the survey did not include travel and accommodation, which is where those who holiday at home make big savings.

The charms of the Lake District mean that it is near the top of the list for those choosing to stay in the UK

The staycation research was 
commissioned by Travelodge, which has an interest in people staying in 
the UK, however it was based on an online poll of 3,000 people conducted
 by a third party company called OnePoll.

The boost in 'staycations' could make for a very different set of holiday snaps

The
 hotel chain claims that the surge in people taking a holiday at home 
will boost the UK tourism industry by £3.3billion compared to last year,
 taking the total to £12 billion.

The study found that 42per cent of the staycationers will taking a one week holiday in the UK this summer, 15per cent are indulging in a two week break and a third will take three short domestic breaks.

People in Wolverhampton, Liverpool, Cardiff, Chelmsford and Manchester were most likely to say they are holidaying at home this summer.

Chief executive of Travelodge, Grant Hearn, said: ‘The staycation trend accelerating to record levels and boosting our economy by £12 billion this year, is a  very welcome sign, and hopefully this is the start of our 2012 Olympics legacy gain.

‘During 2012, our capital city was showcased in its true glory to all corners of the UK and the world, and it’s a great result that London has been crowned as the top staycation destination for 2013.’

However, he said the government is failing to capitalise of the UK’s tourism potential and suggested the Department for Culture, Media Sport, which is run by Tory Secretary of State Maria Miller, it at fault.

He said: ‘We are not yet near to 
unlocking the true potential of our industry. British tourism needs to 
be treated like a serious business sector and  the Government needs to 
move our industry from the ineffective Department of Culture Media &
 Sports to the Department for Business, Innovation & Skills.

The success of last year's London Olympics has encouraged more people to stay at home for their holiday

‘Lack of immediate action is costing jobs, growth and investment.’

The Thomas Cook study put the cost of a basket of holiday purchases in the UK at £125.74, which was the second most expensive behind the £157.96 for Sydney, Australia.

The cheapest short-haul option was Tenerife at £47.28 for the same basket of goods. Tunisia came in at £52.86, while Egypt is also cheap at £54.07 and even Florida was much less than Britain at £59.25.

The holiday companies have seen a big increase in the sale of all-inclusive packages, where all meals and drinks are included in the headline price, as a direct result of the squeeze on household budgets.

Joanna Wild, the Thomas Cook retail director, said despite the nation’s money troubles: ‘An overseas holiday offers exceptional value for money, whatever board basis our customers choose, given that prices in many resorts abroad are considerably cheaper than in the UK.’

She said all-inclusive deals now account for more than half of all holidays they sell and are particularly popular with families.
