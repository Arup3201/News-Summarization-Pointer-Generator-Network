For thrifty suitors who believe it is the thought – not the expense – that matters, it could be a godsend.

With Valentine's Day looming, a supermarket price war has broken out over the traditional favourite statement of love: a dozen red roses.

Instead of the £70 that it could easily cost for a hand-tied bouquet of top-quality long-stemmed Grand Prix red roses, a chap can nip to Lidl and snap up a bunch for just £3. 

That offer even undercuts its rival Aldi, which is charging £5 for its cheapest bunch. 

Major supermarkets are preparing for Valentine's day by offering roses for as little as £3

Tesco, Asda and Morrisons have also slashed the price of their cheapest red roses to £5 for 12, while Sainsbury's has a dozen Fairtrade red roses for £7.

Lidl's £3 bouquet consists of 12 Sweetheart red roses, which have smaller blooms. Aldi is also offering a dozen 'Luxury Freedom Roses' for £15 and a dozen 'Premium Naomi Roses' for £20.

Tesco is selling its premium bunch at £10, a luxury bouquet at £15 and its Finest red roses at £30. Prices at Marks & Spencer range from £12 for a dozen red Kenyan roses to £40 for its 'Freedom' variety.

Of course, that works for lovers who can deliver their flowers to the lady of their desire in person.

Those having blooms delivered via Interflora could pay anything from £44.99 to £139.99.

Most of the red roses sold around Valentine's Day are imported from Africa. There are many varieties, from cheaper blooms with small tight heads to Red Desire, which have long stems and luxuriant deep red blooms. 

A Lidl spokesman said: 'The Sweetheart roses come from both Uganda and Zimbabwe. The head is about 2cm and they would be classed as short stem at around 35-40cm. 

'We're able to offer an unbeatable price because we have a long-standing relationship with the supplier and are buying in generous volumes.'

But the price war is bad news for the nation's independent florists, who cannot possibly compete.

A spokesman for the British Florist Association said: 'Independent florists are finding it harder and harder to survive.'

They warned that 8,000 florists shops could disappear in the face of competition from supermarkets.

For men agonising over whether to go for the cut-price or the extravagant, a survey commissioned by Morrisons has troubling news. While 85 per cent of bunches bought on Valentine's Day are red roses, 46 per cent of women say they are a lazy choice... and would rather receive a more imaginative variety of flower.

Tesco are also offering 12 roses for £5, along with Morrisons and Asda. Sainsbury's cheapest bunch is £7

At the more luxury end of the market, Marks & Spencer offer between £12 for a dozen red Kenyan roses to £40 for its 'Freedom' variety
