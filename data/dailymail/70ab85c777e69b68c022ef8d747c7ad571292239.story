She has faced some of the most turbulent times of her public life in recent weeks.

But Nigella Lawson, 53, is still a fashion icon to many, it is revealed today.

The striking figure-hugging dress she wore to promote her US TV show The Taste has completely sold out, confirmed British fashion house Diva Catwalk.

This is the dress worn by Nigella - blue has now sold out but other colours are available

Those planning to buy the £85 cobalt blue Midhurst dress will now have to wait until January 15, when the firm re-stocks, as every size has now been snapped up.

'Nigella knows the kind of fabrics that we have and she knows what she likes,' a Diva spokesperson tells MailOnline.

'Most recently she's worn the Midhurst 
style and the New Chevy style. She's worn the swing Chevy style in the 
past as well as many of our other designs.

'Her stylist came in and bought the dress, took it back for Nigella to have a fitting and then brought it back and asked us to shorten the sleeves.

'We
 produce ready-to-wear items and have designers in house. We tend not to
 alter a lot of styles due to the volume of work but we altered the 
sleeves of the Midhurt dress especially for her.'

The sexy frock is just the latest in a string of ensembles Nigella has helped shift.

This time last year the curvy TV chef caused a stir after wearing a £175 red stretch-dress dubbed Billion 
Dollar Babe from British store Deadly Is The Female.

It sold out within hours as fashionistas flooded to the boutique in Frome, Somerset.

A third label, The Pretty Dress Company, experienced a similar surge after its Forties-style Mistress Black Day Dress with white Peter Pan collar and cuffs, at £95, flew off the shelves after Nigella stepped out in it.

The voluptuous cook certainly knows what suits 
her hourglass figure, frequently opting for form-flattering slinky 
numbers with plunging necklines and demure hems from smaller British labels.

For her latest style success Nigella has returned to Diva Catwalk, whose New Chevy wiggle dress she wore in a photo shoot for the Mail's Event magazine.

The £125 fitted design featured check material with stylish black lapels and pocket details.

Carol Vorderman and Lorraine Kelly also frequently wear Diva's designs on TV.
