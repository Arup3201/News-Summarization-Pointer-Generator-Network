A video showing a cow being dragged behind a truck has caused outrage among animal lovers in Russia.

The video, filmed with a car dashboard camera, show the large animal being pulled down a highway outside the port city of Rostov-on-Don in the Rostov region, in the west of Russia.

The cow’s owner, a local farmer, has defended the decision to transport the animal behind the truck, claiming it was the only way to save her life.

Dangerous moove: Animal lovers were outraged after this video of a cow being dragged down a road in Russia was posted online

The true story behind the cow-dragging came to light after police, forced into action by a wave of complaints, tracked down the truck driver and the farmer, Ivan Kladov.

Mr Kladov, 66, said he had received a call from a neighbour to say that one of his cows had strayed out of its field and was walking beside the road.

By the time he arrived, the animal had been struck by a speeding vehicle, and was lying injured beside the road.

‘The cow probably weighed a ton and it was impossible for me to move her on my own,’ he said.

‘I couldn't leave her in the road to go back and get help or get my tractor, so I had the idea of seeing if I could drag her there, and I managed to persuade the driver of a truck to stop and help me out.

‘We managed to drag the cow onto a piece of plywood and he dragged her slowly down the road to my farm, where I managed to get her into the stable using a tractor.’

The user that posted the video said he had thought the animal was dead until he saw it moving its tail and had been shocked at the way it was being treated.
