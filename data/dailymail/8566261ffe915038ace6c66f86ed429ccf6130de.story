Three victims of what is believed to be the largest outbreak of hepatitis C in U.S. history have been awarded $24million (£15m) in compensation.

A jury in Nevada found the state's largest health management organisation liable for damages after patients were infected during treatment at Las Vegas clinics.

The outbreak became public in early 2008 when the Southern Nevada Health District in the city notified more than 50,000 patients to get tested for blood-borne 
diseases including AIDS.

Health investigators later traced 
hepatitis C infections of nine people to procedures conducted in 2007 at
endoscopy clinics owned by doctor Dipak Desai.

A further 105 patients were found to have the disease, but they weren't conclusively linked to Desai's clinics.

After the verdicts in the negligence lawsuit were read out, plaintiffs Bonnie Brunson, 70, sobbed as she clasped hands tightly with her 
72-year-old husband, Carl.

A third victim, Helen Meyer, 76, whispered 'I'm in shock' to a friend at the end of the liability phase of what has been a 
six-week civil trial in Clark County District Court.

'This country needs for people to know they can trust their health insurance company,' Mr Brunson said later.

The Brunsons' attorney, Robert Eglet, 
said he'll ask the jury of three men and five women today to hold Health
Plan of Nevada and Sierra Health Services responsible for another 
$1billion in punitive damages for what he called 'reckless disregard' 
for patients' health and safety.

'This case is the example of what is wrong with health care in our country,' Eglet said after the jury was dismissed for the day.

'The insurance companies are making 
hundreds of billions of dollars every year and yet the public is not 
getting quality health care.

'And doctors aren't being fairly paid, so they have to take on too many patients to make a living.'

Judge Timothy Williams asked them to reconvene for proceedings on the punitive damages question.

Lead defense attorney, D Lee Roberts Jr., declined to comment.

But
the two companies issued a statement promising an appeal and repeating 
their lawyers' complaint that they were prevented from showing the jury 
that company executives didn't know about allegations that Desai was 
endangering patients with unsafe endoscopy practices at his outpatient 
clinics in Las Vegas.

'We 
are disappointed, but not surprised, by this verdict given the volumes 
of essential evidence the jury was blocked from hearing during this 
trial,' the statement said. 'We look forward to presenting our case on 
appeal.'

Since the civil lawsuit was filed, 
Health Plan of Nevada and Sierra Health Services have become part of 
United Heathcare, part of publicly traded UnitedHealth Group.

Roberts,
who argued that Desai was responsible for the hepatitis outbreak, not 
the companies, is expected to ask the jury and the judge to limit any 
damages to the Brunsons and Meyer.

Meyer
and Bonnie Brunson were infected with hepatitis C during treatment at a
Desai clinic in 2005, according to evidence at trial.

Hepatitis literally means the inflammation of the liver. It is usually caused by a virus, although alcohol excess can also be to blame.

The most common types of liver inflammation and infection are Hepatitis A, B and C.

Hepatitis C is a blood borne virus, which can be passed on through sexual contact, but is most commonly spread through the sharing of drug needles. There is no vaccine.

It is known as 'the silent killer' because it often has no symptoms and goes undetected for decades.

While most people recover from hepatitis A with no lasting liver damage, B and C can cause long-term liver disease, leading to cirrhosis and even liver cancer. 

In many cases there are no early warning symptoms until liver damage is advanced. 

Hepatitis A is spread by eating contaminated food or drinking water.

It's most common in countries with poor hygiene standards. There is a vaccine.

Hepatitis B is usually passed on by exposure to infected blood. In developing countries it is mostly passed from mother to baby.

In developed countries it's spread through sex and sharing drug needles.

It is 100 times more infectious than HIV, yet there is a vaccine to prevent infection.

Carl
Brunson's claim for damages was for loss of consortium, which gives the
plaintiff the right to compensation for the deprivation of benefits of a
family relationship due to their injuries or impairment.

During closing arguments, Eglet accused the companies of ignoring warnings before quitting a contract with a competent doctor to sign Desai to a low-bid contract.

Eglet sought $20 million in compensatory damages for Bonnie Brunson and $5 million for Carl Brunson.

Meyer's lawyer, Will Kemp, asked jurors to be 'fair and reasonable.'

Bonnie Brunson was awarded $12 million, Carl Brunson $3 million and Meyer $9 million.

One juror looked long at the Brunsons and Meyer as she was seated, and dabbed at her eyes with a tissue as the verdict was read.

Desai, once a powerful member of the state Board of Medical Examiners, wasn't named in the civil lawsuit.

He has denied wrongdoing, declared bankruptcy and surrendered his medical license, but faces trial in state court in April and federal court in May on separate criminal charges stemming from the outbreak.

His lawyers have fought for years to prove that he is so incapacitated by strokes and other physical ailments that he is unfit for trial.

State prosecutors accuse Desai of faking his medical conditions in an attempt to escape prosecution.

Eglet and Kemp also won hundreds of millions of dollars in civil judgments in 2011 against pharmaceutical companies they blamed for supplying recklessly large vials of the powerful anesthetic propofol to Desai clinics.

Jurors were told in that case that the large vials were unsafely reused from patient to patient.

Desai and his clinics reached undisclosed settlements with plaintiffs before trial in those cases.
