A 22-year-old teacher in New Jersey was arrested on Friday for allegedly having sexual contact with one of her 15-year-old students at Wall Township High School, where she is a 9th-grade English teacher.

A complaint filed against Warnick - who in addition to teaching at Wall Township High School, also graduated from the school - accuses her of aggravated criminal sexual contact and 
endangering the welfare of a child.

Warnick, who has been working as an at-home summer instructor since June, was arrested July 30 and released after posting $50,000 bail.

According to the criminal complaint, the incident was reported on July 14.

Monmouth County prosecutors would not provide further details.

Charlie Webster, spokesman for the Monmouth County Prosecutor’s Office, told the Asbury Park Press that his office could not release any information as to how police were 
made aware of the alleged sexual contact between Warnick and the student.

'It’s an ongoing investigation. The complaint will have to speak for itself,' Webster said.

Wall Township Board of Education President Eva Applegate said she is 
aware of the allegations against Warnick, but  also declined comment.

'The board will be discussing the employee’s contract renewal in a closed session next week,' Applegate said.

The teacher's attorney, Alton Kenney says she will plead not guilty 'because she is, 
in fact, not guilty.' He says he expects her to be exonerated and return
to work as a teacher.

Attorney James Maggs, who is assisting the boy's family, says he has gone through a 'horrible ordeal.'

Warnick is due in court Aug. 6.
