Syrian President Bashar al-Assad has revealed he is kept informed of US-led coalition strikes against ISIS through 'third parties' such as Iraq.

Speaking in a rare interview, the defiant tyrant also denied using barrel bombs against his own people - something human rights groups have accused him of doing throughout the four-year civil war.

Assad has always denied claims of such atrocities, including allegations that chemical weapons were used in an attack outside the capital in 2013 that killed up to 1,400 people.

But it is the first time he has revealed details of how information about coalition strikes is passed on through the 'back door'.

'Sometimes, they convey a message, a general message,' he said in the interview  in Damascus.

'There is no dialogue. There's, let's say, information, but not dialogue.

'There's no direct co-operation,' he added, saying the messages came to Damascus through third parties.

'More than one party, Iraq and other countries. Sometimes they convey messages, general messages. But there's nothing tactical,' he said.

His comments came as yet more victims were rushed to hospital after what activists said were airstrikes from forces loyal to Assad in the Douma neighborhood of Damascus yesterday. 

'We have bombs, missiles and bullets,' he added, dismissing claims that his forces were using indiscriminate weapons.

'There are no indiscriminate weapons. When you shoot, you aim, and when you shoot, when you aim, you aim at terrorists in order to protect civilians.

'I haven't heard of (the) army using barrels, or maybe cooking pots,' he said, laughing, in an interview with the BBC published today. 

Referring to the alleged 2013 gas attack, he said: 'Who verified who threw that gas on who?'

And asked if his government was responsible, he said 'definitely not,' adding that the reported death toll was 'exaggerated.'

He also said his forces were 'definitely not' using chlorine as a weapon.

Since Syria gave up its chemical arsenal in a Russian- and U.S.-brokered deal after the 2013 attack, there have been persistent reports of the use of chlorine gas.

In many of those instances, residents reported hearing helicopters, suggesting the involvement of government forces. 

Damascus has grudgingly accepted the strikes against ISIS on its territory that began on September 23 last year, but has repeatedly criticised the coalition for failing to coordinate with it.

It says the raids cannot defeat ISIS unless the international community starts cooperating with Syrian troops on the ground.

Assad said the US-led strikes had the potential to help his government if they were 'more serious.'

'Who threw that gas on who?' President Assad also denied claims that Syria's government had used chemical weapons against its own people in August 2013 in an attack outside the capital that killed up to 1,400 people

'Yes, it will have some benefits, but if it was more serious and more effective and more efficient. It's not that much.'

Washington has ruled out co-operating with Assad's government against IS, and the Syrian leader said Damascus had no interest in joining the coalition.

'No, definitely we cannot and we don't have the will and we don't want, for one simple reason - because we cannot be in an alliance with countries which support terrorism.'

The comment appeared to be a reference to coalition support for other rebels groups fighting to overthrow him, all of which his government derides as 'terrorists'.

Assad said U.S. officials 'easily trample over international law, which is about our sovereignty now, so they don't talk to us, we don't talk to them.'

More than 210,000 people have been killed in Syria since the conflict began with anti-government protests in March 2011.
