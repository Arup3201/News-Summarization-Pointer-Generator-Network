Accused: Phil Gannon, 58, who was held over the alleged racial abuse during Liverpool's match with Manchester United

A father-of-four accused of making 
racist 'monkey' gestures during Liverpool's weekend FA Cup tie is a 
member of a Facebook group 'Luis Suarez is innocent'.

Phil Gannon, 58, was caught on camera apparently aiming abuse at Patrice Evra 
during the match against Manchester United.

Race row striker Suarez, 25, was banned for eight matches for abusing Evra during a match at Anfield earlier in the season.

Liverpool fans complained that the 
forward, 25, had been harshly treated after he was given a suspension - and campaigned for his name to be cleared.

Gannon, 58, was held after footage from Saturday's match, which was shown on ITV, apparently showed him making a racist gesture at the defender.

Police are still reviewing the footage and yesterday released him on bail after questioning.

Liverpool won the game 2-1.

The father also wrote on Facebook that his interests include 'inter-continental rioting' and 'global regime change'.

A Merseyside Police spokesman last night confirmed a 58-year-old man had been bailed until April in connection with the incident.

A neighbour of Gannon, from Barmouth, North Wales, confirmed that he was the person who had been held.

Yesterday his wife Karen, 50, told The Sun that Phil was 'no racist'.

Police stressed the incident during Saturday's game was an isolated one and the the crowd had been generally well behaved.

It is the third 
incident of this kind in a few months at Anfield, which began with 
United defender Patrice Evra accusing Luis Suarez of racial abuse, for 
which the Uruguayan was banned for eight matches.Â 

Oldham player Tom 
Adeyemi was also reduced to tears over what he believed was racial abuse
during the third-round tie at Anfield earlier this month.

A spokesman for Merseyside Police said: 'A 58-year-old man from North Wales who was arrested on suspicion of a racially aggravated public order offence yesterday following the Liverpool and Manchester United match has been released on police bail pending further inquiries.'
