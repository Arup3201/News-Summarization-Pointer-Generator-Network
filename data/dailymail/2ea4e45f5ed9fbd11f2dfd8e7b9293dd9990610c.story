Can I get a witness? Slobodan Milosevic during his trial at the Hague in 2004. A key witness against him wants to sue over her protection arrangements 

A key witness in the trial of Slobodan Milosevic wants to sue the Metropolitan Police after its witness protection scheme left her living a miserable double life.

The  former lawyer in Serbia, who now works in Marks & Spencer in a northern English town, says her entire former life was erased and she was left living in a council house on benefits.

A decade after testifying against Milosevic, she she wants to sell her old flat in Belgrade and use the money to sue the Met and the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia.

But to do that she must first re-establish her former identity as a key aide to Serbian warlord Arkan, which she abandoned after an attempt on her life in 2003 following her testimony against Milosevic.

She told The Times: 'I'm not thinking about the risk because I would like to speak clear and loud; victims and witnesses should be protected. Anonymity makes me the criminal, not them.'

Known as witness B129 during the trial against Milosevic for war crimes, her testimony gave evidence of the links between the him and Arkan - aka Zeljko Raznatovic - leader of the brutal militia known as Arkan's Tigers.

That irregular unit cut a bloody swathe through the Balkans during the ethnic tensions of the Nineties and is said to have been deeply involved in the ethnic cleansing of Bosnian Muslims during the violent break up of Yugoslavia.

Although B129's identity was obscured at the trial, a court technician mistakenly released a recording of her real voice which led to an attempt to run her over as she walked the streets of Belgrade.

After that, according to The Times, B129 and her husbnand were placed on a witness protection scheme organised by the ICTY and managed by the Metropolitan place.

Their former identities were erased and they were housed on a council estate in the north of England and given £100 a week benefits to live on. All their previous qualifications went too.

'My husband had to take his driving test again, I could not practise,' B129 told The Times. 'I am still trying to finish my qualifications as a solicitor here.'

The couple soon found work and have since raised a family under their new names in the UK, but even that wasn't the end of B129's involvement in attempts to bring war criminals from the former Yugoslavia to justice.

She told Times reporter John Simpson that in 2010 the ICTY and the Met 'bullied' her with threats of subpoena and even possible detention to testify again, this time against two Serbian officials who were subsequently cleared.

Now B129 wants recognition of the struggle she has faced in trying to help convict suspected war criminals, which has left her living on the margins of British society.

She says she has been left living a double life, one in her home and a totally different one when she goes outside.  And she is disillusioned by Hollywood portrayals of U.S. programmes which give relocated witnesses a house and car.

B129 was once so close to the highest echelons of Serbian society that she was a guest at Arkan's wedding to pop star and actress Svetlana Velickovic, a regional megastar.

Arkan was himself indicted by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia in 1999 for crimes against humanity, but was assassinated before he could be brought to trial.

After Yugoslavia crumbled in 1991, Arkan formed the Serb Volunteer Guard paramilitary group - also known as Arkan's Tigers. They were blamed for some of the worst atrocities of a conflict for which the term 'ethnic-cleansing' was coined.

B129 refused to condemn Arkan and denied his unit had been responsible for ethnic cleansing, claiming they were a special forces unit that did not aim to attack civilians. 

She added: 'I'm not defending any party. War is the last and worst solution.' 

A team of Serbian security agents who held top positions in the regime of Slobodan Milosevic have been linked with the unsolved murder of Jill Dando.

In a bizarre claim, it is said the tyrant held a grudge against the BBC presenter because she made a successful TV appeal to get help for the millions of Kosovan refugees displaced by his murderous regime.

The four men accused of being involved are wanted over a string of political murders in their home country.

A widow of one of their alleged victims said Miss Dando's execution in April 1999 has all the hallmarks of her own husband's murder, which was two weeks earlier.

Serbian historian Branka Prpa was with her husband, Slavko Curuvija when he was shot dead outside their home in Belgrade on April 11, 1999 - 15 days before Miss Dando was killed outside her home in Fulham, west London.

She believes that the same people who killed her husband came to London to kill Miss Dando. Both were high-profile journalists who were returning home when they were assaulted, then shot in the head.

There has been a long-running link between Serbia and Miss Dando's murder. In the immediate aftermath of the 1999 killing an anonymous caller phoned the BBC claiming he had killed the Crimewatch presenter over Nato action in the former Yugoslavia .

However, senior Scotland Yard sources have said there was 'not a shred of evidence' that Miss Dando killed by Serb assassin.
