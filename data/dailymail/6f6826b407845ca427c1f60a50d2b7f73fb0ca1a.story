Rio Ferdinand has suffered unfair abuse over his QPR performances due to his celebrity status, according to Harry Redknapp.

Rangers boss Redknapp believes summer recruit Ferdinand has been singled out for undeserved criticism as the Loftus Road club fight for a Premier League foothold.

Ferdinand became embroiled in a war of words with the chairman of anti-racism group Kick It Out Herman Ouseley this week after the publication of his latest autobiography, '£2sides'.

The former Manchester United defender has clashed with Kick It Out over John Terry's trial for alleged racist abuse against Anton Ferdinand.

Chelsea captain Terry was cleared in court in July 2012, but issues around the case resurfaced with Ferdinand's new book.

Redknapp defended his centre-back, claiming the 35-year-old's off-field interests do not hurt his top-flight prowess, ahead of his 500th Premier League appearance this weekend.

'You'll always pick on the big players,' said Redknapp.

'I didn't see him make too many mistakes last week. He clipped a ball that got turned over and they ended up scoring a world class goal.

'It's probably because he's high-profile. That's the biggest problem.

'Joey's on Twitter and Rio wrote a book. It happens all of the time. Lots of footballers do it, like Wayne Rooney. What can you do? They are high profile now. It's part of the game.

'I don't think it's fair. We've been a bit open and we need to tighten up. I've got no problems with Rio.'

Redknapp will lead a clutch of ex-Hammers returning to Upton Park for QPR's Premier League clash with West Ham on Sunday.

The former West Ham manager said he expects Ferdinand, Bobby Zamora, and Rob Green to relish their East London return.

'Hopefully we can go back there and pick up a good result,' he said.

'I'm sure there's an added motivation. They go back there and want to play well.

'All my memories were from going there as a kid. It's a special football club for me.'

Ferdinand was at the Mayfair Hotel in London to launch his #2sides

Redknapp first managed Ferdinand at West Ham and said the ex-England defender was always destined for the top.

'He was only 15 and I saw the potential in him then,' said Redknapp.

'I said he would be the best defender in Europe because he was on another level. I knew he was going to be a big player.'
