Pixar has changed the ending to its upcoming ‘Finding Nemo’ sequel.

In response to the controversy surrounding ‘Blackfish,’ a documentary about SeaWorld orcas, Pixar reportedly rewrote the ending to ‘Finding Dory,’ the much-anticipated sequel to the box office smash ‘Finding Nemo.’

The movie’s ending reportedly involved a marine park similar to SeaWorld before being modified.

As a result of the sometimes harsh ‘Blackfish’ … and the resulting publicity battle SeaWorld has had to fight, Pixar decided to restructure that part of the story so that the fish and mammals taken to its aquatic center have the option to leave,’ the New York Times reported.

Though it’s not uncommon for movie scripts to change prior to the final cut, it is uncommon for plot changes to be made public before the premiere.

The notoriously secretive Pixar is known to keep quiet about films until they are ready for release, according to the Times, which noted that this reported change is the only known part of the story line.

‘Blackfish’ has caused a raft of problems for SeaWorld since its release earlier this year. The documentary tells the tale of Tilikum, the orca who caused the 2010 death of trainer Dawn Brancheau, according to NBC News.

The film then delves into how SeaWorld treats its stable of orcas, also known as killer whales, portraying the park as exploiting the giant orcas.

Gabriela Cowperthwaite, the film’s director didn’t expect it to have as big an impact.

‘I don't have one end goal for this film,’ Cowperthwaite told NBC News "I didn't want the film to ever feel like it was telling you what to do or how to feel... if you were moved by it, that feeling is yours.’

The beleaguered marine park lashed out at the film Friday in a written statement.

‘Blackfish is billed as a documentary, but instead of a fair and balanced treatment of a complex subject, the film is inaccurate and misleading and, regrettably, exploits a tragedy that remains a source of deep pain for Dawn Brancheau's family, friends and colleagues,’ the statement said.

‘To promote its bias that killer whales should not be maintained in a zoological setting, the film paints a distorted picture that withholds from viewers key facts… that SeaWorld rescues, rehabilitates and returns to the wild hundreds of wild animals every year, and that SeaWorld commits millions of dollars annually to conservation and scientific research,’ the statement continued.

The rebuttal was the latest in a back and forth between the filmmaker and SeaWorld, which has even seen the theme park chain release a series of objections to the film that were then posted to the documentary's website and addressed on an individual basis.

Despite the bickering, Pixar has green-lit the script change. The film is due out in 2015.
