Turning back the clock to your youth might seem appealing.

But when 34-year-old Naomi Jacobs woke up convinced she was 15, it was the start of a terrifying ordeal.

The mother of one had been struck by a rare form of amnesia brought on simply by stress.

Naomi Jacobs developed a rare form of amnesia that caused her to lose 17 years of her life

The last thing she could remember was falling asleep in her bunk bed as a schoolgirl, dreaming about a boy she had a crush on.

When she woke, she thought it was 1992, John Major was prime minister and she was about to sit her GCSEs.

Mobile phones and the internet were a total mystery, and worst of all she had no idea who her 11-year-old son Leo was.

'I looked in the mirror and had the 
fright of my life when I saw a woman with wrinkles staring back at me,' 
said Miss Jacobs yesterday.

'Then this little boy appeared and 
started calling me mum. That's when I started to scream. I didn't know 
who he was, I didn't think he was much younger than I was, and I 
certainly didn't remember giving birth to him.

Transient global amnesia (TGA) is a type of amnesia involving the sudden, temporary disturbance in an otherwise healthy person's memory.

The leading hypotheses are
some form of epileptic event, a problem with blood circulation around, 
to or from the brain, or some kind of migraine-like 
phenomenon.

TGA attacks are associated with some form of precipitating event in at 
least one-third of cases.

In females, this event is more often of a 
strong emotional character; in males, it is more often related to some 
physical exertion.

The most commonly cited precipitating events 
include sexual intercourse, swimming in 
cold water or enduring other temperature changes, and emotionally 
traumatic or stressful events.

TGA is most common in people between age 56 and 75, with the average age of a person experiencing TGA being approximately 62.

'I began sobbing uncontrollably. To 
say I was petrified was an understatement. I just wanted my mum. I 
couldn't get my head around going to bed one night and waking up in a 
different century.'

Miss Jacobs had Transient Global 
Amnesia, a form of memory loss brought on by stress. It affects five in 
100,000 people inÂ  Britain, rising to 23 in 100,000 in the over 50s.

Before her attack, Miss Jacobs, of Manchester, was worrying about a homeopathy business she ran.

She was studying for a psychology 
degree and had her final exams approaching, and had recently split up 
with the father of her child.

The condition caused the 'episodic' part of her memory to shut down, meaning she had lost all her emotional memories.

But her semantic memory was still 
intact, meaning she could remember things she had repeated over time 
such as how to drive and phone numbers she had regularly dialled.

This meant she was able to ring a friend and her sister to ask for help, and they took her to a doctor.

There is no specific treatment other than support and reassurance from family and loved ones.

Fortunately, Miss Jacobs had this, and after eight weeks her memory began to return to normal.

Looking through old diaries further 
helped her piece her life back together, and now she has finally 
regained most of her memory.

Jacobs' last memory was of falling asleep as a 15-year-old dreaming about a boy

Yesterday she told of her ordeal ahead of publication of a novel she has written based on her experience in 2008.

'It has taken three years of hard 
work to piece most of my memory back together, and it just helps me to 
appreciate all I have,' she said.

'At 15, I thought I would have 
conquered half the planet by my thirties. It was a massive shock to 
discover I was just an ordinary, single mum and driving a battered old 
Fiat Brava.

'My best friend and sister had to 
take over all communication for me. I had no idea how to work my mobile 
phone, and had no concept of email.

'For the first few months, I was 
desperately trying to make sense of my life. At night, I'd lie awake and
cry, longing to be back at school.'

She added: 'At first, I struggled to leave my home, and venture out into the world.

'It wasn't fun, like Michael J Fox in
Back To The Future. I'd fallen asleep in a world of endless 
possibilities and woken up in a nightmare.

'My best friend and my sister had to 
sit me down and painstakingly explain 9/11, 7/7 and the war on terror. 
Facebook, Google and YouTube sounded like they were completely made up. 
The first time I saw Leo play on his X-box and interact with the TV, I 
was so shocked I spat out my tea.

'Although it was traumatic, I'm 
really grateful for being thrown forward through time now. It's made me 
re-evaluate my life and decide to follow my childhood dream of becoming a
writer.'
