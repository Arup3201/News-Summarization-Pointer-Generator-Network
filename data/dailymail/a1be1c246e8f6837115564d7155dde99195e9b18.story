The Government was accused of caring more about ‘bean-counting than national security’ after it emerged the Ministry of Defence employs more accountants than senior Army officers.

Figures show the MoD has 2,490 civilian staff working in the ‘Finance Job Family’, compared with 2,300 senior officers.

These include generals, lieutenant generals, major generals, brigadiers and colonels put together.

The Ministry of Defence employs more accountants than senior Army officers, figures reveal

The number of accountants at the ministry has sparked outrage at a time when thousands of frontline servicemen are being axed amid crippling military cuts.

The MoD, in the midst of one of the toughest cost-cutting drives in its history, is axing 30,000 troops, fleets of warships, warplanes and armoured vehicles to save £4.7billion and plug a £42billion black hole in its equipment budget.

Some 25,000 civil servants are also losing their jobs.

Shadow defence spokesman Kevan Jones, who uncovered the statistics, said: ‘It sums up Defence Secretary Philip Hammond that the Ministry of Defence has more accountants than senior Army officers.

‘These figures confirm suspicions that he cares more about bean-counting than he does about defence and UK national security.’

Commander John Muxworthy, a Falklands veteran who is chief executive of the UK National Defence Association – which campaigns to ensure the Armed Forces have the right equipment – said: ‘This seems to be excessive. There is a complete imbalance within the MoD. To have so many accountants at a time when the numbers of officers and other ranks are being decimated seems astonishing.’

Mr Jones has also learned that 820 military number-crunchers axed in the past three years have been paid £23million in compensation. Around £2.8million was then spent on external accountants.

Mr Jones said: ‘Millions have already been wasted on botched procurement reform and a failed IT project, and the public will be justifiably angry at yet another example of incompetence on Philip Hammond’s watch as Defence Secretary.’

The MoD insists it needed them to deal with complex contracts. Yet the huge arsenal of financial expertise has still seen the MoD hit by a series of damaging blunders and accusations of waste.

A withering National Audit Office report earlier this year found the cost of Britain’s biggest military programmes are £6.1billion over budget because wasteful defence chiefs have failed to live within their means.

Defence minister Anna Soubry said: ‘The figures need to be seen in the context of the tough financial decisions made by  this Government.

‘We estimate that by 2021-22 we will have achieved cumulative savings of some £23billion as a result of reductions in service and civilian personnel and greater efficiency in the conduct of non-frontline activities.’

A spokesman for the MoD said: 'Since 2010, we've cut the number of civilian finance staff by a quarter at the same time as balancing the budget and eliminating the £38 billion black hole in the Defence budget inherited from the previous administration.

'MoD finance staff make up just one per cent of our workforce, but the idea that we don’t need them to manage a £34billion a year budget, some of the most complex procurement projects in the country, and the smooth-running of the MoD’s bases and locations around the world is absurd.'
