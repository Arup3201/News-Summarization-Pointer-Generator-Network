These days the Cheltenham Festival is a marathon not a sprint but Willie Mullins appears to have an outstanding chance of establishing a big lead in the trainers’ title with four stellar chances on Tuesday.

Sky Bet Supreme Novices’ Hurdle favourite DOUVAN (Cheltenham, 1.30) is the first of the Mullins battalion to leave the blocks before the baton is passed to powerhouses UN DE SCEAUX (Cheltenham, 2.05) in the Arkle Chase and the exciting FAUGHEEN (Cheltenham, 3.20), who boasts an outstanding chance in the Stan James Champion Hurdle.

Many feel Annie Power will complete the victory parade with her coronation in the OLBG Mares’ Hurdle, but she will be priced prohibitively to do so and her task may not be as straightforward as it seems after a year’s absence.

Of the quartet, Faugheen arguably faces the most competition with last year’s winner Jezki and The New One, an unlucky third following an interrupted passage, in opposition along with National Hunt legend Hurricane Fly. However, Faugheen’s potential is as yet untapped, whereas the level his rivals have reached is known — albeit a lofty standard.

The selection destroyed the opposition in the Christmas Hurdle at Kempton with the form receiving a boost when third-home Blue Heron, beaten 17 lengths by Faugheen, hammered Irving at Wincanton in Grade Two company.

That performance poured scorn on the theory Faugheen has beaten nothing in his unbeaten eight-race hurdling career, although it is worth noting he also boasts a 22-length mauling of Josses Hill in a Punchestown bumper and a 12-length demolition of the talented Valseur Lido on his record.

In short, the son of Germany could prove to be a class apart, especially if The New One continues to drift right at his hurdles, a habit which threatens his hopes of becoming a champion.

Jezki is solid and comes to himself at this time of year on spring ground, but his limitations have been somewhat exposed by Hurricane Fly in Ireland this winter and he remains vulnerable to an emerging talent like Faugheen.

Hurricane Fly has been done few favours by the drying ground, but the third of Mullins’ representatives, Arctic Fire, could sneak into the places.

Tuesday’s nap vote goes the way of CAUSE OF CAUSES (Cheltenham, nap, 4.40), who appears to have undergone an interesting preparation for the National Hunt Chase and was a fine second in a handicap at the meeting 12 months ago when an error at the last fence denied him victory.
