The unburied body of legendary radio host Casey Kasem remains at a funeral home in Tacoma, Washington, a month after his death.

A spokesperson for the DJ’s daughter Kerri, said Kasem's children from his first marriage hope he will be buried at Forest Lawn cemetery in Glendale, California, as he wished.

Kasem died June 15 at a hospital in Washington state. Danny Deraney said the celebrity's second wife, Jean Kasem, has the rights to his body but has not yet arranged for him to be buried.

A month on from his death, the unburied body of legendary radio host Casey Kasem remains at a funeral home in Tacoma, Washington

Hospital spokesman Scott Thompson with St. Anthony Hospital said Kasem's wife collected his remains from the hospital after he died, but Thompson did not know what arrangements she made.

A call to Jean Kasem's attorney was not immediately returned on Tuesday.

Kerri Kasem told The View last month that the bitter feud between her siblings from her father's first marriage and their step-mother had deepened over what to do with the dead body.

Miss Kasem said: 'I don't know what's going on with [Jean] and why she makes the decisions she does.'

Battle: Casey's widow Jean has accused his children of trying to get their hands on the former DJ's life insurance following his death earlier this month

Widow Jean Kasem has accused the DJ's children of making a desperate grab for his life insurance following his death.

Mrs Kasem 
accused his daughter Kerri of calling his funeral home to ask how 
quickly a death certificate could be issued so his sizeable policy could
 be cashed in.

However,
 Kerri hit back, saying that Jean hadn't had Casey body flown out to
 L.A. for burial because she was trying to deflect attention from an 
imminent investigation into elderly abuse.

Kerri Kasem also told The View that she could not remember why the feud started.

She said: 'If I knew I would tell you. I would try and make amends. I would say, ''I'm sorry Jean. What happened? ...Why do you hate us so much?'''

The legendary DJ died on June 15 - Father's Day -  aged 82 from Parkinson's disease, dementia and sepsis.

Kerri Kasem claimed Jean took him out of his rest home and moved him 
around the U.S. at the end of his life to keep him away from his family.

During the trip he developed a bedsore which contributed to his death, his children have claimed.

Jean is now arguing that the whole saga is a ploy by his children to get their hands on his money.

According to TMZ,
 Jean said: 'Their impatience for Casey to die was obvious... and now 
their impatience to collect on the life insurance is even more telling.'

The DJ's eldest children held a memorial service for him a week after his death which was attended by 200 people including his brother, but excluding Jean and her daughter Liberty, who she had with Casey.

Jean
 has put Casey's Beverly Hills mansion, complete with eight bedrooms, 14
 bathrooms, tennis courts, and a piece of the Brooklyn bridge, on the 
market for $42million.

According to reports, 
Jean will be handling funeral arrangements for the late DJ after his 
daughter Kerri agreed to her request to hand over his remains.

Kerri
 Kasem had been granted custody in May over her father’s medical 
care, but that role expired when her father died on Father's Day morning.

An attorney for Kerri told TMZ that Jean's attorney had reached out to request the body be released to her. The pair didn’t speak directly.

According to a recent filing of Casey's health directive he wanted a burial. Jean Casem will act as the executor of Casey's will. 

His death was announced on social media by his children, Mike, Kerri and Julie Kasem. The message didn't include the name of
 his second wife, Jean Kasem, who had been fighting them in in an ugly 
court battle over his medical treatment.

'Early this Father’s Day morning, our dad Casey Kasem passed away surrounded by family and friends,' the message read. 'Even though we know he is in a better place and no longer suffering, we are heartbroken.

'Thank you for all your love, support and prayers. The world will miss Casey Kasem, an incredible talent and humanitarian; we will miss our Dad. With love, Kerri, Mike and Julie.'
