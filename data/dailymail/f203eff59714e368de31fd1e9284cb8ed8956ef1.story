Social media giant Facebook has announced that several company computers were victims of a cyber attack that occurred sometime last month.

‘Our systems had been targeted in a sophisticated attack,’ read the statement dated February 15.

Warning signs: Often accused of being loose with user data, Facebook recently announced it recently came under a 'sophisticated attack'

The company says the infiltration occurred when ‘a handful of employees’ visited a website that, in turn, infected their laptops with security compromising malware.

This, the statement says, despite the laptops being ‘fully-patched and running up-to-date anti-virus software.’

According to the statement, the compromised site installed software that bypassed internal security through a so-called ‘zero-day,’ or previously unseen, vulnerability and exploit the company’s built-in protections.

Under investigation: Reports say Facebook knew about the attacks, which likely exploited a Java software flaw, well before the announcement

As reported by the New York Times on Friday, the security hole was a ‘well-publicized vulnerability in Oracle’s Java software.’

Facebook says they immediately quarantined the affected laptops and alerted authorities.

‘We have no evidence,’ the company stated on a blog post announcing the incident, ‘that Facebook user data was compromised in this attack.’

All atwitter: On Feb. 1, Twitter announced a breach and 250,000 of its users' data was potentially accessed

Weeks before the announcement, on February 1, Facebook was provided a patch for the software from Oracle, the makers of Java.

That same day, ubiquitous microblogging site Twitter announced its security had been breached and 250,000 of its users’ data potentially accessed.

Twitter then suggested that other companies had fallen victim to similar attacks.

Today's Facebook’s announcement made similar claims.

‘Facebook was not alone in this attack,’
the statement read. ‘As one of the first companies to discover this 
malware, we immediately took steps to start sharing details about the 
infiltration with the other companies and entities that were affected.’

Dark forces: Twitter and Facebook have named not their attackers, but both have claimed that multiple organizations were similarly affected

Facebook, says a New York Times source close to the investigation, has known of the problem for at least a month.

A Facebook spokesman says the company chose to wait longer than the companies it claims were also ‘attacked and infiltrated’ made their own announcements in order to fully investigate the origin of the breach along with authorities.

Facebook’s announcement does not cite Twitter or what other specific companies were affected along with them.

Nonetheless, the events come at a conspicuous time for high-profile cyber attacks.

In late January, both the New York Times and Wall Street Journal announced they’re systems had been infiltrated by Chinese hackers in apparent attempts to monitor the outlets’ coverage of that country.

Meanwhile, neither Facebook nor Twitter have suggested who might be responsible for their security breaches.
