It is the moving, funny video that has made millions smile in the last 48hours.

But the simple video, which shows Jennifer LaFace dancing alone in her bedroom to the hit song 'Teach Me How to Dougie' has been viewed over four million times since it was re-posted on Facebook.

Part of the videos appeal is not just the unbridled fun Jennifer is clearly having but the fact that she made it to inspire her sister, Colleen Madeya, who has ovarian cancer, as she began her seventh day of chemotherapy.

Speaking to camera at the end of her dance, Jennifer, from Pennsylvania, tells her sister: 'You're going to kick cancer's ass today because you're a badass sister. … I love you with all my heart and my soul. 

'That's about it for today! I admire you. Later, gator.'

Speaking to Right This Minute, Jennifer jokes: 'In my head I'm like Justin Timberlake's back-up dancer.'

Talking about how she began making the videos for her sister the mother-of-two says: 'She was going into surgery when they diagnosed her with stage four ovarian cancer. 

'I just put on some dance music and I thought she loves to dance so I made a video and sent it to her. It makes her laugh, it keeps her mind off it.

'My sister inspires me to be a better person. She's my wonder-woman.'

Jennifer says she does her own dance to the song because she's not very good- but the comments left on the video seem to disagree

Despite Jennifer starting the video with the disclaimer that she isn't doing the real 'Dougie' dance associated with the song becasue she is 'not very good' at it', many of the comments disagree. 

'I just kind of do my own dance selection because I'm not a follower, I am the leader of my own weird band,' Jennifer jokes before beginning her moves dressed in a simple stripy T-shirt and jeans. 

'She's actually really good!' one person comments while another agrees saying 'I like her. She knew the words and she was on point. Go girl.'
