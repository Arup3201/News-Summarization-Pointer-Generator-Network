A woman whose breast exploded after she had a boob job in Tunisia has warned others not to travel abroad to go under the knife. 

Alison Chapman, 45, said that she has suffered a 'horrendous and humiliating' ordeal after the surgery went wrong. She has now successfully claimed compensation after one of her implants exploded in the shower when she returned home.

She said: 'I took a hot shower to try and 
relieve the pain and was absolutely horrified when my breast burst open.
I couldn't believe what was happening to me.'

The mother-of-one was rushed to hospital where she 
underwent surgery to close the wound and fight the infection. She then 
needed two further operations to replace the implants and repair the 
scar.

Ms Chapman said she deeply regrets having the breast enlargement abroad.

'I hope my story acts as a warning to anyone else considering having cosmetic surgery abroad,' she said. 'If I could turn back the clock I 
would not have had the operation there and would have spent more time 
looking into the potential risks that come with having surgery at a 
foreign clinic.'

Ms Chapman said she had wanted a boob job because she had suffered from low 
self-esteem due to the size and shape of her chest throughout her life.

'I'd been deeply 
unhappy about my figure for years and didn't take the decision to have 
the breast surgery lightly,' she said. 'I looked on the internet and, when I 
came across the clinic in Tunisia, it seemed professional so I made the 
decision to go.'

However, she now admits this is  'one of the biggest regrets of my life'.

After returning to her home in Southampton after the first procedure in 2009, she was disappointed with the results, which she felt 
had left her breasts uneven.

She returned to the clinic for a corrective procedure but this only made matters worse.

'After both operations, the staff 
seemed more bothered about getting cash from me than providing me with 
any after-care or support,' she said.

'I was in absolute agony after the 
second operation and knew something wasn't right, but when I called the 
clinic for advice no-one could help. It was horrendous.'

After her breast then exploded in the shower, she has had to undergo further procedures in the UK.

She said: 'It's taken three years of 
reconstructive surgery to repair the wound and reduce the scarring and I
now feel more self-conscious than ever before, it's been very 
humiliating.'

Sandeep Aujla, a specialist in injury abroad cases at Irwin Mitchell solicitors, said that they had secured a five-figure compensation claim from the credit card company that Ms Chapman used to pay for the surgery.

She said: 'Unfortunately, we see many clients who have travelled abroad to undergo surgery and suffered problems.

'The problems suffered by Alison are increasingly common and can have terrible consequences.

'Patients can be left paying out thousands more than private surgery in the UK would cost as a result of a foreign clinic's mistakes.'
