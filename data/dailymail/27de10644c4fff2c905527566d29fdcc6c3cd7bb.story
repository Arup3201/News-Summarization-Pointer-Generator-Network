Bolton are attempting to sign young Liverpool winger Jordon Ibe on a season-long loan from Liverpool.

The 18-year-old is a highly-rated prospect at Anfield but has the likes of Raheem Sterling, Philippe Coutinho, Lazar Markovic and Adam Lallana blocking his path to the first-team.

So struggling Bolton, who are 21st in the Championship following Tuesday night's 2-1 defeat by Middlesbrough, are trying to persuade Liverpool to give them Ibe for the rest of the campaign.

Impressive: Jordon Ibe shone against AC Milan in pre-season but his first-team chances are limited

And Wanderers manager Dougie Freedman is set to put the jet-heeled wing merchant straight into the side as he looks to turn around his club's sorry start. He has also taken Crewe striker Max Clayton, 20, on trial.

Ibe knows the Championship after a loan spell with Birmingham last season and was part of the team that avoided relegation on the final day after a dramatic draw with Bolton at the Reebok.

The England Under 19 star has featured for Liverpool in pre-season, impressing against AC Milan and coming on against Borussia Dortmund and his style of play is similar to Sterling's.

He made his Wycombe debut at just 15 and 244 days and is the club's youngest ever player in the Football League. He joined LIverpool aged 16 for an undisclosed fee.

Struggling: Dougie Freedman's Bolton are 22nd in the Championship after the 2-1 defeat by Middlesbrough

Joy: Ibe is lifted up by Lee Clark as Birmingham avoid relegation on the final day at Bolton
