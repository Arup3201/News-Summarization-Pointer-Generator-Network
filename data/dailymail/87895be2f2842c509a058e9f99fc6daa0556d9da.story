They're agile creatures, known for their ability to get in - and out - of the smallest of spaces.

However this kitty needed help to get out of this tight squeeze after she became wedged between two garage walls.

Tiger the tabby cat was stuck fast in the two-inch gap between the bricks walls - and apparently used up one of her nine lives in the process.

Stuck fast: Tabby Tiger had to have help getting free from this tight squeeze after getting trapped between two garage walls

A team of RSPCA officers, fire crews 
and a vet were all called to come to the aid of the trapped cat after 
her owner Samantha Harper raised the alarm.

After sedating the confused animal, 
firefighters then mounted a delicate operation to remove bricks from 
inside the kitchen at one of the properties to reach her.

The one-year-old cat suffered only a scratched paw after the accident near her home in Stourbridge, West Midlands.

Ms Harper, 27, said: 'When I saw where she'd got stuck I just couldn't believe how she'd got in there.

'We only went out for a couple of hours and came home to find Tiger had caused havoc in the street.'Nobody thought she would survive and when I saw the gap she was in it is unbelievable that she did.

'She only stayed at the vets one night as she was completely fine except for scuffed claws.'

RSPCA inspector Jackie Hickman tried to get to the distressed pet but was unable to reach her so she dialled 999.

She said: 'We were all baffled about how the cat got into such a small gap and even more baffled at how we were going to get her out.

'We did fear we may have to remove part of the external wall which would have been major work but after much thought we decided to try and remove some bricks from inside the kitchen of the property.

'After removing the bricks we could actually touch the cat but she was still wedged solid.

'After more discussion the cat was sedated by the vet in the hope she would fully relax and become easier to move.

'We were all thrilled when this strategy worked.'
