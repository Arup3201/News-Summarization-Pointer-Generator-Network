Felix Magath admits he told Brede Hangeland to use cheese to nurse his knee injury, but the former Fulham manager remains adamant the allegations are 'laughable'.

Magath, sacked  on Thursday with Fulham currently bottom of the Championship, believes the accusations are because Hangeland is 'not performing on the pitch' and 'not in the spotlight'.

Despite it being Danny Murphy who confirmed Hangeland was told 'to put a lump of cheese soaked in alcohol on his thigh and to leave it overnight' on Match of the Day 2 Extra, the German manager aimed his retaliation at the now-Crystal Palace player in question.

Felix Magath lasted just 18 games in charge of Fulham before being sacked by the Championship strugglers

20 - Birmingham (P8, W1, D4, L3 - 7PTS)

21 - Bolton (P8, W1, D2, L5 - 5PTS) 

22 - Huddersfield (P8, W1, D2, L5 - 5PTS)

23 - Blackpool (P8, W0, D2, L6 - 2PTS)

24 - Fulham (P8, W0, D1, L7 - 1PT) 

'(Hangeland's) portrayal of what was actually said, is so far from the truth, that it becomes laughable,' Magath wrote in a 300-word post on Facebook.

'He had an injury to the knee (inflammation) and I mentioned that he could try using an old technique of wrapping the knee with quark, which is used to decrease the inflammation. 

'I would never tell a doctor how he should manage the injury to a player, but it seems that this story has been wrongly told and blown completely out of context.'

Magath, replaced by Kit Symons at Fulham, labelled Hangeland's statements 'completely wrong'. 

He continued: 'It seems to me, that often players who are not performing on the pitch and are not in the spotlight, will make such ridiculous accusations. 

'A world class player in the mold of Michael Ballack or Raul, would never ever make such statements, class speaks for itself.'

And Magath hit back at his 'apparent tough handling' of the Fulham squad and staff, too.

He added: 'Steve Wigley a former employee and ex-coach of Fulham and current coach of Nottingham Forest, who worked with me at Fulham, stated recently: "I liked Felix, he was during my time with him, very good to me."

'It is very important in my profession to be judged objectively, as I can imagine all of you would also expect. I have no problem with constructive criticism, but malicious gossip just goes too far in my opinion. 

'And I will most certainly defend myself against a defamation of character, which is put out to damage my reputation.'

Fulham currently sit bottom of the Championship, having lost seven of their eight matches so far, drawing the other. 

Hangeland joined Premier League outfit Crystal Palace during the summer on a free transfer.
