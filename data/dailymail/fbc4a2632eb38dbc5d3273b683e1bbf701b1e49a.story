Disgraced AFL star Josh Bootsma, 21, propositioned a young fan for sex on social media within 15 minutes of the pair connecting, the Herald Sun has reported.

The damning allegations against the 21-year-old also include claims he sent explicit images, constantly invited her to his house and reassured her he was single even though his girlfriend was heavily pregnant.

On Tuesday, Carlton sacked the up and coming Blues player after a mother of a teenage girl came forward with images the 21-year-old had been sending to her daughter's friend.

Adults who send sexually explicit messages to anyone aged 16 or under can face criminal charges, and in Bootsma's case, police have not ruled out investigating.

In the wash up since the player's sacking, The Herald Sun has claimed to have seen five months worth of social media activity between Bootsma and the women he allegedly sent lurid and explicit material to.

In one case, it has been reported that Bootsma groomed at least one Carlton fan before asking her for sex. He allegedly sent to the fan: 'I think you are a sexy girl who deserves to be treated like a princess.' In another, he asks the fan if she is 'up for a sex session on Tuesday.'

One image viewed by The Herald Sun also appears to show Bootsma pictured in the bath from the waist down asking the intended recipient to 'join' him.

A 23-year-old woman has spoken to the Sun Herald on anonymity, claiming Bootsma added her on Facebook after she started following him and other Carlton Blues supporters on Instagram.

It is alleged their communication started as early as August last year, and continued until November only to end when Bootsma's girlfriend became aware of his online activities.

The pair met in person at an open training day last year and he started sending her messages on social media platform, Kik, the next day.

She said she wasn't fooled by Bootsma's attempt to court her into having sex. 'I caught on pretty quickly what he was about,' she said.

Carlton terminated the 21-year-old's contract on Tuesday, saying the player had been repeatedly counseled and warned for his inappropriate behaviour.

This is not the first time Bootsma has been in breach of the club code, and when Carlton football manager Andrew McKay addressed the media on Tuesday he said Bootsma had been known to arrive late to training and skip appointments.

'That was the final straw that broke the camels back for us to decide to terminate his contract,' Mr McKay said.

When asked about the nature of the inappropriate content, Mr McKay said he didn't believe it was necessary to go into the details.

'The point is he's put something on social media that's highly inappropriate, and it really does not meet the standards of the football club.'

The football manager also said that the club had tried to help Bootsma by offering him support and welfare but he had continued to let the side down.

'The Carlton Football Club has high expectations of its players and staff; we expect them to uphold certain standards,' he said.

In a statement Carlton said the defender had been offered counseling and welfare but had not met the club's behaviour standards, according to the Herald Sun.

Bootsma had a contract with the club until the end of 2015, and is currently coming to an agreement with Carlton in regards to it, with The Age reporting that he will not be paid out.

He hasn't taken to the field for the club this year, and his last game was played in round 21 of 2013.
