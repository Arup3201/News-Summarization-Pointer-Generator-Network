A dyslexic designer has redesigned a range of household objects to reflect and explain how his mind works.

Henry Franks’ 'dyslexic objects' range contains upside down inverted mugs, double-hooked coat hangers, an elevated coaster, and a pen pot that holds just two pens at a time.

Mr Franks, who has recently been crowned Designer of the Year for his topsy-turvy creations, says that he created the range to put a dyslexic perspective on everyday household items.

The 23-year-old, who is graduating from Northumbria University with a First-Class degree in 3D design, said: ‘I looked at the traits of dyslexia and applied them to objects.

‘I've had problems with reading because of the letters inverting so I applied it to a redesign of mugs.

‘The Muglexia products are more stable and balanced in the hand because the handle position is upside down and lower than normal.

‘The inverted shape also keeps tea and coffee hotter for longer.

‘Through these designs I wanted to provide alternatives to mundane products that don't often see new design innovation.’

Dyslexia is a common type of learning difficulty the mainly affects reading and spelling.

Mr Franks says he looked at the traits of dyslexia and applied them to objects. He created double-hooked coat hangers so that a dyslexic person would not have to worry about which way round to hang them

A person with dyslexia has difficulty 'decoding' words and symptoms can range from mild to severe.

Someone with the condition also tends to struggle with their verbal memory and their verbal processing speed - the time it takes to process familiar letters and digits.

There is no link between dyslexia and intelligence.

It is estimated that four to eight per cent of all schoolchildren in England have some degree of dyslexia.

Mr Franks’ range of designs includes a 
wooden toilet seat with a toilet roll holder attached to make it easier 
for a dyslexic person to find it, and a raised coaster which means that a
 dyslexic person is more aware of the mug and is, therefore, less likely
 to knock it over.

It also includes a double-hooked coat hanger which would help a dyslexic person by allowing them to hang their clothes either way around, and a pen pot which only holds two pens so as to avoid clutter and prevent the dyslexic mind becoming confused.

Mr Franks, from Oxford, said: ‘I set out to design and make a range of objects which utilise the characteristics of dyslexia to provide emotionally engaging alternatives to the often bleak world of contemporary products.

‘I wanted to encourage the user to question the form or function of an object and not just take it for granted.

‘Making the user think about the object and form new positive connections with the product is the overriding aim of this project - to provoke thought.’

He also designed door stops which are the shape of penguins because he believes that giving inanimate objects an emotional function helps a dyslexic mind
