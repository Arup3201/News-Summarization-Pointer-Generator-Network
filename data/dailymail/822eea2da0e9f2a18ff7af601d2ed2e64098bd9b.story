Nigel Farage has given up drinking alcohol for January, he admitted today.

The Ukip leader, who has built his reputation on being seen with a pint glass in his hand, wearily conceded that after a festive season of boozing: 'I need a break.'

He plans to spend the rest of the month supping orange juice, but refused to give up his treasured cigarettes.

Nigel Farage has revealed he has given up drinking alcohol for January, shedding his image for posing with a pint glass

Almost everywhere he went in 2014, Mr Farage was seen with a pint, including in Belfast (left) and London

Mr Farage has previously argued that the works so hard as an MEP in Brussels that he is 'entitled' to a lunchtime pint.

But now he has confessed that his body needs a respite from downing pints of ale.

'I started before the new year,' he told Sky News.

'I am not being particularly virtuous about this. I just… I need a break. It does us all good to have a break every now and again.'

Asked if it was a total break from alcohol, he replied: 'Oh yes, absolutely.'

During a visit to Yarm in April he even went behind the bar to pull his own pint while campaigning in the European elections, with Ukip went on to win

But pressed on whether he has also given up smoking, he admitted defeat: 'Oh no, I will think about that later in the year.

In the last year he was frequently pictured in celebratory mood, raising a glass – or several – to the latest Ukip triumphs.

His party won the Euro elections in May, secured two defections from the Tories in the summer and went on to win two seats in the Commons for the first time.

The pubs of Clacton and Rochester did well out of visits from Mr Farage on the campaign trail.

Last month Mr Farage appeared on a Channel 4 show with Gogglebox favourites Steph and Dom Parker, where the trio quaffed champagne, beer and wine

Last month he appeared on a Channel 4 show with Gogglebox favourites Steph and Dom Parker, where the trio quaffed champagne, beer and wine.

Mr Farage had to change his trousers after smashing a glass and spilling his drink and ended up borrowing a pair of Mr Parker's ripped jeans.

During a 'rip-roaring' evening, he told the Radio Times he had 'two pints, about five or six glasses' of wine and champagne during the encounter.

'I like a drink, but crikey, these guys are professionals,' he said.
