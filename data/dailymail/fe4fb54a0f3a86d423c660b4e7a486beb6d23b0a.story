Britain will shiver into December today as temperatures plunge.

Frost will cover the country and flurries of snow may reach as far south as the Chilterns.

Yesterday an icy blast blanketed the entire country as the mercury struggled to get anywhere above freezing.

Still, these horse trainers in Surrey were happy to ride it out as temperatures dropped below zero.

In Shap, Cumbria, it was as cold as -7C (19F).

Meanwhile the 
village of Ravensworth in North Yorkshire saw the mercury freeze at 
-5.8C.

The first snow of winter is expected to fall this morning followed tomorrow by further heavy rain in the West.

The threat of more rainfall – up to an inch – will be another desperate 
blow to those already struggling to recover from the floods of earlier this week.

The Met Office said it had extended its yellow warning for further ice across large swathes of the country amid the threat of more rain and sub-zero temperatures.

‘There’s going to be a widespread frost on Saturday morning across large parts of the country and a few icy stretches,’ warned Met Office forecaster Charles Powell.

‘That risk will continue. We’ve extended our yellow warning for much of northern England advising people to be aware and remain vigilant and that’ll stay in place over much of the weekend.

‘There will also be one or two showers across the Cornish coast.

‘We have a little bit of snow on the way and that clump of rain, sleet and snow will gradually make its way southwards from Scotland.

‘By Saturday morning the snow will have reached the Pennines and the North Yorkshire moors with up to 4cm falling in places.

‘It will continue southwards throughout the day but it will get increasingly weak and light. There could be a sleet or snow flurry across parts of the Chilterns.’

Temperatures are predicted to drop 
well below freezing throughout the weekend – as low as -5C (23F) in many
 parts of the country.

The Met Office warned of a ‘90 per cent probability’ of a severe cold snap lasting until at least noon on Sunday.

By then the snow will be replaced by
 heavy and persistent rain, particularly in the South-West where flood 
waters have already wreaked havoc. As much as 20mm could fall.

The Environment Agency is said to be closely monitoring the situation amid fears of further flooding.

 By Monday milder temperatures are 
expected to give a little light relief before another cold front hits 
the country on Wednesday.

‘Next week will begin with relatively mild temperatures,’ added Mr Powell.

‘We could get as high as double figures, that’s up a couple of degrees on what we have had recently.

‘By Wednesday it will get a lot colder, the snow showers will return and temperatures will drop below freezing again.’

Forecaster Stephen Davenport of 
MeteoGroup, the weather division of the Press Association, added a front 
of rain was moving south, bringing wintry conditions with it.

'There’s going to be a mixture of rain, sleet, hail and snow showers,' he said.

'In the northern parts of the country, over the hills, there will be a 2cm to 3cm covering of snow with up to 4cm in some spots.

'There may be snow showers down the 
eastern side of the country. The northern areas will certainly see a 
covering and further south you are likely to see a dusting on the 
verges.'

Those who brave the cold should wrap up warm, as temperatures are unlikely to rise more than 5C 
to 7C throughout Saturday.

And while Sunday is expected to start
 dry, a band of clouds moving in from the Atlantic could bring more snow
 in the evening - although the Met Office stressed this was likely to be
 'transient' snow which would not settle.

Forecaster
 Charles Powell said: 'Drivers may see snow flurries as they drive, but 
we do not expect this to settle and it should not be around for Monday 
morning's rush hour.'

The 
Met Office has urged motorists to remain vigilant ahead, while councils 
have stockpiled 1.3million tons of road salt and have hundreds of 
gritters on standby.

But it
 is feared that standing water left by this week’s devastating floods 
will continue to run off the fields and verges and wash away the salt.

It
 is unlikely to fall in any great quantity but the combination of 
sub-zero temperatures, further rain and snow could result in treacherous
 driving conditions.

The Government announced £120million new funding for flood defences today, as families in parts of the country face the aftermath of more flooding.

Ministers said £60million would be targeted at areas where improving defences against flooding could unlock investment and growth in the area, and the rest would go to speed up delivery of up to 50 schemes already in the pipeline.

The Government estimates the money, which will be delivered between next year and 2015, will improve flood protection for up to 60,000 homes and provide one billion pounds in economic benefits.

Potential projects which could benefit from the funding targeted at unlocking economic benefits include Leeds, where the riverside area is regularly threatened by floods and defences could protect 250 businesses, employing more than 100,000 people, and more than 3,100 homes.

The Government said the money was in addition to the £2billion being spent on flooding and coastal erosion this spending period up to 2015, more than one billion pounds of which is for capital projects such as flood defences.

There are also fears that up to an 
inch of rainfall could cause further damage to flood-hit areas, 
particularly in the South West. Among those rivers at threat are the 
Thames, Trent and Severn, which all remain at very high levels.

‘By Sunday morning we could see some 
quite heavy rain, up to an inch in places,’ added Mr Powell. ‘As that 
hits the cold air it will turn into snow.

‘It
 will last for about two hours before turning back to rain. As we go 
into Monday it’s going to remain pretty wet and windy with further 
outbreaks of heavy rain in places.’

The
 Met Office also warned that while temperatures would recover by the 
start of next week it would remain unsettled for much of December with 
wintry showers and further outbreaks of rain.

Downpours across the country have caused widespread devastation in towns and communities.

It
 has even led to deaths, with a 21-year-old homeless woman was killed 
when a huge spruce tree fell on her as she slept in a tent in the 
storms.

Michelle Conroy was
 killed by the fallen 50-foot spruce as she huddled against the rain and
 gales in her sleeping bag on a main road in Exeter, Devon.

Friends
 yesterday said she was a 'sweet and caring' person and a canon 
missioner at Exeter Cathedral said she was a 'quiet and polite' person 
who had suffered a 'sad and broken childhood'.
