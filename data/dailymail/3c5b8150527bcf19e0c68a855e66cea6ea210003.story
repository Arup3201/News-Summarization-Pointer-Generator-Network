The daughter of an an 83-year-old woman who went missing from Ronald Regan Washington National Airport last week, and whose body was later found in the Potomac River, says if she had turned around her grandmother might still be alive.

'I’m devastated,' Joy Anderson said to the Washington Post. 'I’m just torn to pieces by the stupidity. It could have been avoided. The way she died, no one deserves to die like that.'

Victoria Kong, 83, had made the return trip to Barbados at least 10 times before but when she got off American Airlines Flight 1094 last Friday at Reagan National Airport she was in a state of confusion.

Disappearance: Surveillance footage shows Victoria Kong, 83, as she walks through the terminal after arriving at Reagan National Airport around 4pm on May 3

Found: Sniffer dogs were used to track Victoria Kong whose body was found within sight of the airport perimeter at Reagan National Airport in Washington

Tragic: Mrs Kong's body was found a short distance from the airport, in the Potomac River

Mrs Kong, who suffers from dementia, 
walked past an American Airlines representative her family had sent to 
meet her at the gate as she off the plane, and then walked past her own 
daughter and granddaughter who were waiting downstairs.

Surveillance video shows Mrs Kong walked through baggage claim while daughter Joy, was facing in a different direction.

By 4:12 p.m., the family said, video showed Kong leaving through a door, never to return.

Searchers, volunteers and Mrs Kong's family spent the weekend combing the area around the airport.

Missed connections: It seems a series of chance errors led to grandmother Victoria Kong (pictured) walking out of the airport and ultimately to her death

Her body was found on Monday huddled in a heavily wooded area, in a park just up the road from the airport terminal.

Her daughter said Mrs Kong had 
been showing some early signs of dementia and that they were worried 
about her safety. She had been experiencing memory loss and confusion 
since her husband died last year but had never wandered off before.

Kong’s family had arranged for wheelchair service with American Airlines and an agent helped Kong get to her flight.

Relatives have said that they 
requested for the airline to escort Mrs Kong both to and from her seat, 
but American said the family only requested service to the gate.

Upon arriving in Washington, Mrs Kong
never made contact with the escort from the airline who duty it was to 
wheel her down to baggage claim.

The family can only assume that she either didn't see the sign or was confused about who was picking her up.

One level below in the arrivals area,
her daughter Joy, had no idea what was going on. She was excited 
to see her mother and had bought her a new cardigan to keep her warm.

The family had recently renovated the
house and added handrails in the shower so she could get around easier.
Reservations had been made for Mother's Day lunch.

Looking over the surveillance video, 
authorities said that she was not visibly in distress or disoriented. 
She is seen talking with people and sitting calmly on a bench.

In the meantime, her daughter 
was still patiently waiting. Luggage from the flight began to arrive 
along with other wheelchair passengers.

After a little while longer she began to grow concerned. She had mother paged and even asked at the ticket desk.

Nobody seemed to know anything. One 
employee told her that Mrs Kong was still by the gate whilst another 
said that she was in the bathroom.

Ms Anderson called American's 800 number. 'Please help me find my mom,' she begged. 'I’m screaming mad right now.'

An hour and a half later, she approached the airport police.

Confusion: Mrs Kong's family had been waiting to collect her in the baggage claim area of the DC airport but she never appeared

Concerns: Mrs Kong's family said that she was suffering from early signs of dementia

Alone: Mrs Kong was supposed to be escorted off the American Airlines flight by wheelchair but appears to have wandered off

It marked the start of a three day 
search for Victoria Kong that involved a boat, dogs, a helicopter, 
volunteers and CCTV video of several different parts of the airport.

At the weekend, tracking dogs, who 
had sniffed Kong’s luggage manage to follow her scent to a wooded area 
about 200 yards from the airport perimeter.

The area where she was found is just off the walking path where it drops off at a steep angle into an area of growth and leaves.

She was still long flower-print dress she wore on the flight. She had her purse, and there were no signs of foul play.

U.S. Park Police are waiting for an 
official cause of death, but relatives said that it appears Kong died 
from the chilly weather.

Her family are devastated but are now planning her funeral.

Her granddaughter Alexandria Anderson still has the cardigan she was going to give to her grandma.

Her death has left family members and friends in the United States and Barbados in shock, she said.

'In Barbados, the house is full of people reading the news ... they’re just devastated' Alexandria said.

'We only anticipated she would be a little slower but would still be grandma.'
