A New York news station committed a major nerd-foul on Friday.

Rather than putting heads in toilets or giving flag pole wedgies, WABC-TV did something much worse to nerds everywhere: identified Mr Spock as a Star Wars character.

Amid news coverage of the recent death of actor Leonard Nimoy, 83, who played Spock in 'Star Trek,' the news station tweeted and pushed an alert through its mobile app saying that the actor starred in 'Star Wars.'

Oops! New York's WABC-TV news station tweeted and pushed an alert through its mobile app saying that Leonard Nimoy starred in 'Star Wars.'

The alert read: 'BREAKING NEWS: Legendary 'Star Wars' actor Leonard Nimoy passes away at age 83.' 

Recognizing its mistake, the news station sent a new alert  correcting the inaccuracy.

Though the snafu was corrected, the damage was already done. 

A photo of the mobile alert surfaced online and was quickly passed around social media online.

As Spock himself taught, 'Insufficient facts always invite danger.' And so it did.

The photo received more than 100 shares as Facebook users flooded the comment section with critical memes.

'Journey:' The news station posted a follow-up tweet to its correction wishing the actor a 'journey free of incident

Of course, the news station deleted the inaccurate tweet and, not only did it tweet the correct information, but a follow-up tweet said 'RIP' to the actor and wished the 83-year-old a 'journey free of incident.' 

Nimoy died at his Los Angeles home Friday after a battle with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. 

The actor became an iconic figure with his portrayal of Spock, a logic-driven, half-alien science officer in the Star Trek television series and movies.
