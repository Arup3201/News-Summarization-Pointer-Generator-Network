A 14-year-old girl died after trying out 'huffing,' a dangerous trend that involves inhaling household cleaners to get a high.

Aria Doherty was found dead at her home in Northridge, Los Angeles on Monday after inhaling computer keyboard cleaner

Her body was discovered by her older sister - she was lying in bed with a can of compressed air attached to her mouth.

Killed: Aria Doherty, 14, died after inhaling computer keyboard cleaner as part of a new trend called huffing

The trend of huffing also known as bagging or dusting is growing among pre-teens.

A recent survey showed one in five children have tried to get high by huffing chemicals before the eighth grade.

But Aria's devastated parents believe it was their daughter's first time at inhaling the chemical and insist she had meant to kill herself.

'I'm positive my daughter didn't realize it had the potential to kill her,' said Carolyn Doherty told NCC.

'This was not that she had done it so many times that the chemicals had finally caused her brain damage or she’d gotten too much into her system.

Tragic: She died after inhaling computer keyboard cleaner

'This is about her having a heart attack from just the very moment that she did the inhaling,' Mrs Doherty told CBS L.A..

The couple had talked to their daughter 
about drug use before and said they had never found any evidence that 
she had huffed at all.

Aria, a straight A student, had been at home alone for a few hours before the discovery was made.

She attended Nobel Middle School and 
teachers there are now planning an inhalant education awareness programme
for her fellow students. 

Last week a 12-year-old girl searching for a high died after she collapsed in her grandmother's bathroom when she huffed freon from the air conditioner outside.

Kristal Salcido, a seventh grader in Victorville, California, was declared brain dead after the incident. Her family took her off life support four days later.

Kristal's horrifying death is a nightmare for her parents and a warning for families everywhere about the dangerous trend of teenagers tapping air conditioning units to inhale the freon gas.

As well as death, the terrifying trend can cause long-term effects including damage to the kidneys, liver and brain.

An autopsy is pending, but it is possible that the computer cleaner caused cardiac arrest or the teen asphyxiated.

Huffing is the common term for 
inhalant abuse, whereby vapors or aerosol gasses are breathed in to 
produce an intense high using a variety of methods.

Substances such as glue, 
petrol or other solvents are often placed in plastic bags which are held over 
the mouth and nose and breathed in.

Aerosols, such as whipped cream cans, hairspray and non-stick frying 
spray, contain nitrous oxide gasses, which can be inhaled straight from 
the can.

Propane and 
butane gasses are also inhaled giving the user an instant and intense 
rush that some have compared to the intravenous injection of class A 
drugs. 

Sometimes rags or clothes are soaked with a substance which are then sniffed.

Balloons may be filed with gasses which are then inhaled and occasionally substances are heated to release noxious vapors.

Effects depend on the substance being 
abused, some solvents taken in small doses will cause a similar 
sensation to being drunk, larger doses are known to cause 
hallucinations, violent behaviour and loss of consciousness.

Youngsters can die trying huffing for the first time, or on any subsequent occasion,  known as Sudden Sniffing Death Syndrome.

This has been linked in particular with air conditioning coolant, butane, propane and aerosol chemicals.

Police
say huffing is a growing trend across the country and experts believe 
there are several hundred deaths each year from Inhalant Abuse.
