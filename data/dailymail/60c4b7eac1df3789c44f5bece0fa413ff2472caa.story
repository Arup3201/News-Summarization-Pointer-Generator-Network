Police were called to a Seattle apartment on Sunday after a woman reported seeing a drone outside the window of her 26th-floor apartment.

Lisa Pleiss was not fully dressed when she spotted the unmanned drone, with a video camera attached, hovering outside at about 7.45am.

She contacted the building's concierge who reported the incident to the authorities after two men were seen packing up film equipment outside the building.

Shocked: Lisa Pleiss says she felt violated after seeing a drone hovering outside her 26th-floor apartment

Exposed: Lisa, who was not dressed when the drone was outside, said she thought her apartment was private

Despite having floor-to-ceiling windows, Ms Pleiss thought her 26th-floor apartment would have more privacy, so she was shocked to see a drone.

'It was freaky. You don't
 expect to be walking around indecent in your apartment and then have 
this thing potentially recording you,' she told KGW8.

She described the encounter as 'nerve wracking' and said that she had tried to get a picture of the drone, which was carrying video cameras, but that it moved too fast.

'It was really scary and just felt really violating. Here I can normally go around my house anyway I want and by no means did I feel that way,' she said.

After local media reported on the incident on Monday, the drone's owner came forward to deny he was spying on residents in the building.

Business: Joe Vaughn says his company was using the drone, right, to film for a property client

The drone, which had a video camera attached, was spotted outside the Seattle apartment building early Sunday morning

Joe Vaughn of Skyris Imaging said the drone belonged to his Portland company, and explained that it was being used to photograph the city's skyline for property developers.

He said he contacted police immediately to give them details of his company, and said his company also sought permission before filming.

Mr Vaughn called Ms Pleiss to apologize on Tuesday morning, and said his company planned to send her a copy of the picture of her building's view.

He denied that the drone was used to spy, and said if the company accidentally filmed inappropriate images, they blurred them.

'People who want us to collect information about other people, they 
aren't our clients,' Mr Vaughn said.

The use of drones have been a contentious issue in Seattle after the police announced plans to use them last year.

The proposal was later dropped on the orders of the mayor, Mike McGinn, after protests from residents.

Former FBI agent Jonathan Gilliam said that the legality of drone use was becoming a problem.

He told Q13Fox: 'Youâ€™re already getting a great amount of these out there and safety is going to become an issue along with legalities of people looking at their neighbors, spying on things.'
