He may be one sixth of showbiz's most famous family and the star of Burberry's Christmas campaign, but  Romeo Beckham proved he's just the average excitable 12-year-old at heart last night.

The young model was at Burberry's Regent Street flagship store to preview his new campaign film and the proud youngster turned it into a family affair.

Clearly chuffed with his starring role for the iconic British brand, Romeo invited his mother Victoria, father David, both sets of grandparents and his school friend along to watch.

FEMAIL went along to watch the youngster make his second campaign appearance for the brand and it was hard not to notice what a proud and down-to-earth family the Beckhams are - despite the immense fame and fortune that's come their way over the years.

Having a blast: Romeo Beckham made headline news when he was unveiled as Burberry's Christmas campaign star and as these behind the scenes shots prove, he had a brilliant time in his starring role

After making his solo red carpet appearance, Romeo and his entourage, waited patiently in a side entrance where Burberry boss Christopher Bailey greeted them.

Obviously happy to see his new campaign star, Christopher showered Romeo with a warm welcome and knelt down to give him a quick pep talk before Romeo made his way through the crowd.

Delightful: Christopher Bailey said that Romeo was an 'utter joy' to work with on his new campaign and brought along some serious style and charm

Clearly unphased by the 500 guests waiting for the man of the night, Romeo strode confidently ahead of his entire entourage and smiled broadly as he walked through the room.

He and his family made their way up to a VIP balcony where they enjoyed a musical performance by British songwriter Ed Harcourt, who wrote the score for the From London with Love film.

Romeo was seen giggling proudly as his campaign film was revealed and watched the entire thing in the arms of his mother, who tenderly whispered into her young son's ear throughout.

Unlike a lot of celebrities, who often show up to an event just for the photocall and quickly dash off, the Beckhams stayed for the entire evening.

Stealing the show: Clearly unphased by the 500 guests waiting for the man of the night, Romeo, pictured behind the scenes on his new campaign, strode confidently ahead of his entire entourage and smiled broadly as he walked through the room at last night's launch

Budding model: Following his mother into the fashion world, the youngster was hand-picked by the British label's Chief Creative Officer, Christopher Bailey, for the second time

Romeo confidently mingled with VIP guests and was seen having a photo taken with his equally dapper young school friend, who was enjoying a mocktail.

David's mother Sandra proved to be the proud grandmother and was seen taking snaps of her grandson on her mobile phone, whilst Victoria engaged in an intimate - and probably fashion-related - chat with Christopher Bailey.

Another star of the evening was Hannah Dodds, the blonde model and dancer who features alongside Romeo in the campaign.

She was congratulated on her role by fellow guests, who included Benjamin Clementine, George Ezra, Sophie Ellis Bextor and some of the Made In Chelsea cast.

Just another day in the office: Romeo may only be 12 but he's already following in his successful parents' fashionable footsteps 

Romeo, who is the second eldest son of David and Victoria, steals the spotlight in the Burberry Festive campaign and judging by these behind the scene pictures, he had a blast doing it.

Following his mother into the fashion world, the youngster was hand-picked by the British label's Chief Creative Officer, Christopher Bailey, for the second time.

Speaking about the campaign and working with the young Beckham, Christopher Bailey said: 'This festive campaign is a celebration of everything we love at Burberry; the trench coat, the cashmere scarf, incredible music, our British weather, and working with great and talented people.

'It continues to be an utter joy working with Romeo - he has charm, style and great energy! I’m delighted that he’s the lead role in our festive campaign.' 

Time for bed: Romeo left the event at 8pm - no doubt to get an early night before school today

He's a pro! Romeo proved he knows how to work the camera as he made his appearance with his family last night
