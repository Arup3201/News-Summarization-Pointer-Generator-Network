Adrian Peterson has been indicted on a charge of reckless or negligent injury to a child in North Montgomery County, Texas.

They relate to the Minnesota Vikings running back allegedly disciplining his young son with a tree branch - referred to as a 'switch' - according to NFL Network's Ian Rapoport.

Peterson's attorney Rusty Hardin released a statement, saying: 'Adrian is a loving father who used his judgment as a parent to discipline his son. He used the same kind of discipline with his child that he experienced as a child growing up in east Texas. Adrian has never hidden from what happened.'

Hardin said Peterson has cooperated fully with authorities and voluntarily testified.

'This indictment follows Adrian's full cooperation with authorities who have been looking into this matter. 

'Adrian will address the charges with the same respect and responsiveness he has brought to this inquiry from its beginning,' Hardin said. 

'It is important to remember that Adrian never intended to harm his son and deeply regrets the unintentional injury.'

The Vikings also released a statement, saying: 'The Vikings are in the process of gathering information regarding the legal situation involving Adrian Peterson. At this time, we will defer further questions to Adrian’s attorney Rusty Hardin.'

Peterson has been deactivated from the Vikings' game against the New England Patriots on Sunday.

The 2012 MVP missed Thursday's practice for what coach Mike Zimmer called 'a veteran's day off', but the 29-year-old was at Winter Park  earlier today and conducted interviews.

Peterson said he had two children who live with their mother in Texas in a 2009 ESPN interview. 

Last year, a two-year-old son of Peterson was murdered in South Dakota. Robert Patterson, who lived with the boy's mother, was charged with the offence. 

Peterson married his wife Ashley Brown in Minneapolis in July.
