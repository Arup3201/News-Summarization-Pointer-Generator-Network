A post-exams house party ended in chaos after 100 dancing students felt the floor collapse beneath their feet.

Revellers at the rented student house in Fallowfield, Manchester, were plunged into the basement after the living room floor fell through under their combined weight.

Guests described how 'everyone was screaming' as the floorboards caved in, throwing up clouds of dust.

Scene: After the house had been evacuated, broken floorboards and sinking furniture could be seen in the room

English student Ella Dix Nagra told student website The Tab: 'I was stood on the edge of the room next to the patio doors, and the floor heaved and started to crumble, and everyone started sliding down.

'As soon as this happened I tried to get out through the patio door but the floor lurched down again and then this dust cloud came up and I got some in my mouth and it was minging.

'Then everyone started to push forward to get out through the patio door and no one could actually get out. I got really squashed because I was right on the edge. Everyone was screaming just proper going it for trying to escape.'

Nobody was seriously hurt in the accident, though some students were cut and bruised and emergency services had to be called in.

Local fire crews came to the scene and also searched the building in case anybody had not made it out after the collapse - though they quickly found that nobody was unaccounted for.

A spokesman for Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue said it was lucky nobody was badly hurt in the collapse - thought to have been caused by rotten timber.

The basement in the house was only three
 feet deep - unlike many of the surrounding properties - meaning 
revellers avoided the 'far more serious' consequences of a further fall.

The spokesman told the BBC: 'We had to evacuate people and search the building to check that nobody was trapped.

'Other houses in the street had basements that were much deeper, so if it'd happened in another house, it could've been far more serious.'

The house's landlord - who asked not to be named - added that there had never been a problem before during the 20 years he had owner the house.

He also said a recent safety inspector found no problems, and that an 'unprecedented' number of people had been inside at the time.
