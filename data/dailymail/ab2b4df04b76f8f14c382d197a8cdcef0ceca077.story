The Premier League are keeping on a fast track with their expected £5billion TV rights auction despite attempts by broadcasting regulator Ofcom to derail the process.

Ofcom are investigating how the Premier League sell their domestic rights following Virgin Media’s complaint that not enough matches are made available for live screening, leading to the sky-high cost of buying TV matches.

An interim report by Ofcom is expected by the end of March, by which time the League would have completed their sales tender. The bid deadline is next Friday for the highlights package and a week later for the seven lots of live games.

The Premier League do not want to wait for Ofcom’s deliberations as it is not known whether the decision in March will be definitive or merely a progress update. And if the PL are told by Ofcom to unravel their sale and start again, a mighty legal battle will ensue.

Graham Bean, the former FA compliance chief accused of fraud after allegedly obtaining £100,000 of unauthorised payments from a family pension scheme, had his case committed to Manchester Crown Court. 

Bean, who is held in such high regard in football that he represented Sir Alex Ferguson at six FA hearings, claims he was the unwitting victim of a pension scam by a financial adviser who has left the country after being struck off by the Financial Services Authority.

Jose Mourinho’s decision to rest captain John Terry  for the FA Cup tie against Bradford will be a blow for midfielder Billy Knott. The former Chelsea junior had taken the premature swapping of shirts to a new level by attempting to book Terry’s shirt to exchange before the fourth-round clash. 

Knott has contacted former team-mate Josh McEachran to help out. He said before Terry was left out of the line-up: ‘I put my request in early and hope Josh can sort it.’

RFU chief executive Ian Ritchie has tried to justify his rampantly commercial organisation bringing out six England shirts within 15 months by saying: ‘We have to have two shirts per season so we have to change kit.’ No they don’t. The RFU chose to sign the lucrative deal with kit suppliers Canterbury that stipulates two new shirts per season — even in a World Cup year when two non-branded shirts have to be worn as well.

Meanwhile the RFU, who used to have a firm agreement with Ticketmaster that their secondary market site Get Me In did not trade seats for England rugby at Twickenham, have seemingly let that deal slip. They confirmed there is now nothing to stop GMI selling England tickets.

MCC vote ‘not cricket’

The beleaguered MCC management committee — described by the Financial Times as starting to make Sepp Blatter look saintly — are now facing demands from members for the 2015 committee election process to be ruled invalid.

This follows MCC, who have seven candidates for four committee vacancies, putting stars on the ballot paper next to the four people they want elected. Those snubbed include Mark Williams, nominated by Mike Atherton and Sir John Major, who opposes the committee stance on Lord’s redevelopment.

Campaign leader Laurence Dillamore called it a ‘rigged election and an insult to MCC’s spirit of cricket’. MCC say no rules are being broken.

The FIFA presidential election is becoming yet more of a circus, with volatile Italian agent Mino Raiola, who represents Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Mario Balotelli, considering joining bookmaker-funded David Ginola on the hustings. No wonder FIFA are having their ethics committee examine the authenticity of the five nominations from national associations required by each candidate.

Adrian Bevington, the former managing director of Club England, has bravely agreed, following his FA leaving party this week, to be a guest pundit on 5 Live’s irreverent quiz show Fighting Talk on Saturday. If Bevington has to ‘defend the indefensible’ what about the FA taking an 88-strong party to the World Cup in Brazil?
