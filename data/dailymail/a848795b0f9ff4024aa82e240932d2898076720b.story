Adding some extra sunshine to the frying pan this winter, one deli in New York is selling double-yolk eggs by the dozen.

Gourmanoff in Brighton Beach, Brooklyn, sells each case of 'Double Yolkers' for $2.89.

It means customers can produce two sunny side ups or poached eggs with a single crack.

The jumbo eggs are produced by the wholesale egg company, Sauder's.

A spokesperson for the Philadelphia-based company told Grub Street that the process is an 'enormous operation'.

Each egg goes through an electronic candling facility where inspectors check for cracks and blood spots.

Double yolks can usually be spotted because of their large size and weight.

When they are discovered they are set aside before packed up in special-sized boxes.

They are usually produced by young chickens, according to  Sauder's because their reproductive systems have not fully matured and they periodically release two yolks instead of one.

Overall, roughly one in 1,000 eggs produced is double-yolked.

The Double Yolkers produced by Sauder's have been sold locally for years but now they are being shipped further afield as customer demand grows.
