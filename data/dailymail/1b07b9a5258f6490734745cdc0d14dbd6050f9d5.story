Glen Johnson will turn down the chance to join Roma and sign a new three year contract with Liverpool.

The 30-year-old was heading for the Anfield exit this summer after an impasse over contract talks allowed Roma to step in and offer the England international a Bosman transfer.

Johnson was free to talk to foreign clubs as his Liverpool deal was due to expire in July.

Inter and AC Milan also showed interest but Roma were most keen and Johnson was interested after hearing good reports back from former England teammate Ashley Cole.

Liverpool had looked unlikely to return to the negotiating table until manager Brendan Rodgers intervened. He called in Johnson for a chat about his future and insisted he still had a role to play.

Rodgers is wary that the loss of Steven Gerrard will leave him short of experienced players in the dressing room while recent success playing a 3-4-2-1 system has reaffirmed his belief that formation would suit Johnson's attributes better.

After speaking with the manager at length, Johnson has been convinced he can continue his career at Anfield.

Rodgers said: 'The intention will be to keep everyone – we can't have three or four leaving next season. Steven will obviously be a loss. When you are losing someone of that calibre of man and player it would be a loss to any club.

'For the younger players to develop their potential they are going to need that seniority around them. You can't just have a whole group of young players.

'Glen is not the marauding full-back of six or seven years ago but he is still a quality player and he has a lot to offer with his experience. His game will adapt over the next couple of years and we want to keep him.

'Like every player he will want that security and to get it sorted earlier than it is now, but when he looks at it and realises he is at one of the biggest clubs in the world, with a team which is developing and growing, he would want to be a part of that.

'I know the club and his agents spoke towards the beginning of the season and I am hopeful we can find a solution and he will stay.'
