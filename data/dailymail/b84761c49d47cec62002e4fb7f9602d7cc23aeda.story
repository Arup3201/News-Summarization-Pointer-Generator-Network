The historical Schonbrunn Palace in Vienna, Austria, has just opened its doors for overnight guests in the former emperor's suite

The suite that will be available for guests to rent offers two opulent bedrooms, a salon, kitchen and two bathrooms, and was once home to Emperor Franz Joseph's private chambers, according to GoUnusual.com, which has listed the property.

Guests in the top-floor suite will also have access to their own private cook, limousine service and butler during their stay.

'At the end of the 17th century Emperor Leopold I commissioned the gifted Baroque architect Bernhard Fischer von Erlach to built a palatial hunting lodge for the heir to the throne,' a spokesperson for the palace said.

'On the site of the old imperial château de plaisance a splendid edifice was to arise.

'Half a century later under Maria Theresa, Schonbrunn Palace was to become the magnificent focus of court life.

'From that time onwards it played host to the leading statesmen of Europe.' 

The stunning estate boasts 1,441 rooms and is currently one of the nation's most-visited tourist attractions

The property has long hosted top international statesmen, including US President John F Kennedy in 1961

A great deal has changed in Austria today, with the country now a republic, but Schonbrunn Palace has remained a place where high-level political meetings still occur.

'The magnificent architecture and the exquisite decor of its state rooms marks Schonbrunn out as a cultural treasure and tourist attraction of the first order,' the spokesperson said.

'In an imperial setting, guests can wine and dine like an emperor and bed down like a princess.' 

The property was first purchased in 1569 by Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian II to serve as a recreational hunting ground.

The palace got the name Schonbrunn, which means 'beautiful spring', thanks to an artesian well on the grounds.

Schonbrunn Palace was first built and remodelled between 1740 and 1750, during the reign of Maria Theresa, who had received it as a wedding gift.

Franz I redecorated the estate in its now-signature neoclassical style.

Franz Joseph, a former Austrian emperor, spent a great deal of time at Schonbrunn until his death in 1916.

When the Habsburg Monarchy fell in 1918, the newly-founded Austrian Republic took control of the property and turned it into a museum.

After World War II, the palace served as offices for British military officers, before being turned into a museum once again in 1955. 

Since the mid-1950s, it's been a major tourist attraction and the location of some important historical events, such as a meeting between US President John F Kennedy and Soviet premier Nikita Khrushchev in 1961.

In 1996, UNESCO inducted the Schonbrunn Palace onto the World Heritage List. 

Although the Baroque decor is remarkable in its own right, these sweeping panoramic views might be the palace's best feature

During a guest's stay in the palace, all services will be provided by the nearby Austria Trend Parkhotel Schonbrunn

From the suite, the Gloriette, Neptune Fountain, the Kronprinzengarten and the palace park are visible, sprawled across 400 acres

The project is unique for Europe and can be booked in partnership with Austria Trend Hotels.

During a guest's stay in the palace, all services will be provided by the nearby Austria Trend Parkhotel Schonbrunn, which itself used to function as the emperor's guest house.

And while plenty of luxurious, regal amenities are on offer, the highlight is undoubtedly the property's unparalleled view.

From the suite, the Gloriette, Neptune Fountain, the Kronprinzengarten and the palace park are visible, sprawled out as far as the eye can see across nearly 400 acres. 

A listing on GoUnusual.com says a one-night stay starts at just under €1,400.
