A former stock broker was arrested early Monday on charges he directed an elaborate fraud on Broadway starring fictitious investors — a scheme that doomed the musical adaptation of Alfred Hitchcock's psychological thriller 'Rebecca.'

Mark Hotton, his wife and three associates also were charged in a separate money laundering scheme on Long Island. They were awaiting a court appearance later Monday.

Federal prosecutors in Manhattan accused Hotton of conning the 'Rebecca' producers by convincing them he had lined up $4.5 million in financing and the possibility of a $1.1 million loan for the show. In return, they said, he collected tens of thousands of dollars in commissions.

Theatrics: Rebecca was due to open on Broadway in November but the arrest of one of the producers has lead to doubts

'Mark Hotton perpetrated stranger-than-fiction frauds both on and off Broadway,' Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara said in a statement.

'Hotton concocted a cast of characters to invest in a major musical - investors who turned out to be deep-pocketed phantoms. To carry out the alleged fraud, Hotton faked lives, faked companies and even staged a fake death, pretending that one imaginary investor had suddenly died from malaria.'

The planned Broadway production of the 1938 novel collapsed earlier this month amid questions about its financial backing, and a growing suspicion that one of its primary investors — a secretive businessman named Paul Abrams who had supposedly pledged $4.5 million, then suddenly died — never existed.

Lead producer Ben Sprecher 'is extremely gratified that Mr. Hotton has been taken into custody,' said his attorney, Ronald Russo, adding that Sprecher has 'cooperated completely with the investigation.'

'Mr. Hotton's fraudulent conduct did enormous damage to Broadway and to 'Rebecca,'' Russo said. 'Mr. Sprecher is totally committed to bringing 'Rebecca' to New York.'

Hotton was charged with two counts of wire fraud, each punishable by up to 20 years in prison. His attorney, Heath Berger, did not immediately return a call for comment.

According to the criminal complaint unsealed Monday, Hotton tricked the producers into believing he had secured the money from four overseas investors, who weren't real.

The producers agreed to pay Hotton $15,000 in fees and commissions between March and June 2012, prosecutors said. He was also paid an additional $18,000 'advance' against his 8 percent commission, they said.

The final curtain? Although Broadway productions are always cloak-and-dagger operations, the financial wrangling behind Rebecca has left many in the theater community stunned

When it became obvious that investors' commitments would fall through, Hotton allegedly tried to broker a $1.1 million loan for the producers, prosecutors said.

The prosecutors say Hotton 'enlisted his same cast of invisible men to carry out a real estate scam.' They did not name the Connecticut real estate company.

Hotton also was accused of using a similar scheme to con a Connecticut-based real estate company into paying $750,000 to him and entities he controlled, Manhattan prosecutors said.

Drama: Ben Sprecher's production of Rebecca has been left with a $4.5million shortfall

In the separate Long Island case, federal prosecutors in Brooklyn accused Hotton and his wife of cheating business partners out of $3.7 million.

An indictment alleges that the couple, while operating three electrical contracting companies, created fake invoices showing money owed by third parties. They then allegedly sold the purported debts to other companies.

It was revealed last week, according to the New York Times, that Mr Sprecher had never even met Abrams.

Mr Sprecher confirmed to the Times 
that his cast would be paid this week but rehearsals delayed until new, 
unnamed investors paid up.

Sprecher, a seasoned off-Broadway 
producer, had dealt with Abrams only by phone after his leading investor
canceled a trip to New York for a face-to-face meeting.

After Abram's death, Mr Sprecher flew to London to try and extract money from his investor's estate.

However he never met any representative in person, dealing only with 'Wexler' by email.

The disappearance of such a wealthy investor left a huge hole in funding for the $12million musical. 

It also left Sprecher's companies liable for millions of dollars to other investors.

Robert E. Wankel, a major Broadway 
player, invested a vast sum 
in Rebecca and owns the Broadhurst Theater where it is intended to be 
staged come November.

He told the Times: 'Broadway does business in its own 
strange way, I’ll grant you. But this is the 
strangest bit of show business to come along in a long time.'

On the show's website it states that rehearsals for Rebecca have been postponed due to the 'tragic death of one of Rebecca's key investors'.

The musical version of Rebecca opened
in September 2006 in Vienna, Austria where it played for more than three years.

Productions have been staged across Europe and at the Imperial Theater in Tokyo to great success.

Four years ago, plans began to 
move the entire production to the Broadway stage but complications in 
sets and special effects saw the effort cancelled.

Mr Sprecher's production is due to open on November 18, starring Jill Plaice, Ryan Silverman and Karen Mason in the lead roles.

Ben Sprecher is behind The Sprecher 
Organization which had worked on projects including the theatrical 
adaption of The Exorcist, a new musical called Havana and the stage 
version of Little House On The Prairie.

Rebecca, a gothic mystery, was written by Daphne Du Maurier
in 1938 and tells the story of a female protagonist, known only as 'I',
who agrees to marry a wealthy English widower, Maxim de Winter, after 
only knowing him a short time.

When she arrives to set up home at his Manderley Estate, she finds the housekeeper Mrs Danvers devoted to de Winter's last wife Rebecca who died in mysterious circumstances.

Du Maurier adapted her own book for the stage in 1939, leading to a successful London run of more than 350 performances.
