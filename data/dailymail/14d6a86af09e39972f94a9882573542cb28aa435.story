A freak stroke of bad luck turned a Florida high schooler's serious but treatable injury into a situation so severe it required the boy's leg to be amputated.

Leshawn Williams, a 17-year-old defensive lineman at Northeast High School in St. Petersburgh, was injured  in a game against Clearwater High School on Friday night.

He was rushed to an area hospital, where doctors would discover that the injury had caused a circulation-strangling clot behind his knee that would soon cost him a limb.

Tense moments: It was clear from the start that Williams' injury would require immediate treatment Friday, but no one would have guest just how serious as he was wheeled off the field. Here, Williams is seen being wheeled off the field as his teammates looked on Friday

Couldn't feel his toes: Blood clots in the defensive lineman's knee caused blood to stop flowing to Williams' right lower leg

His injury was serious from the start and caused a half-hour delay in the game before Williams was taken off the field in a stretcher.

When he arrived at the hospital, he complained he was in pain, but more importantly that he couldn't feel his toes.

Doctors spent the weekend attempting to get the blood flowing back into the limb, the Tampa Bay Times reports.

The decision to amputate below the right knee was made Sunday.

Williams' mother Bonita Copeland said she didn't tell her son about the amputation until the surgery was over and that he continues to come to terms with the loss of his leg.

'It was a freak accident and it could've been something worse,' Copeland said. 'Even though my son lost his leg, I'm happy he's still here.'

So what was so freakish that a teenage athlete lost a limb?

One expert told the Tampa Bay Times that Williams' injury sounded like 'compartment syndrome.'

Compartment syndrome develops when swelling or bleeding occurs within a compartment, which are groupings of muscles, nerves and blood vessels within joints.

Broncos safety Rahim Moore nearly lost his leg from such an injury in 2013. 

However, compartment syndrome is rarely seen in football players.

Williams' coach Jeremy Frioud told The Tampa Bay Times on Monday that the surgery was successful.

His teammates planned to wear stickers bearing his number '69' at the next game in his honor. 

Williams mother first believed her son had injured his medial collateral ligament or MCL, which would not have been uncommon for a football player. She said she didn't reveal the amputation to her son until after the surgery. Here, a gurney is seen before it was used to wheel Williams off the field

Though only rarely seen in football players, an injury-induced ailment called 'compartment syndrome' has been known to cause athletes to lose a limb.

Compartment syndrome develops when swelling or bleeding occurs within a compartment, which the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons says can be caused by athletic exertion or an impact injury.

Broncos safety Rahim Moore underwent emergency surgery in 2013 to staunch bleeding in the muscle sheath in his lower left leg, a condition known as lateral compartment syndrome.

Moore's surgery was successful and he's since returned to the field.

Some fare better: Broncos safety Rahim Moore (26), here catching an interception against the San Diego Chargers, suffered from a form of compartment syndrome that nearly cost him his leg in 2013
