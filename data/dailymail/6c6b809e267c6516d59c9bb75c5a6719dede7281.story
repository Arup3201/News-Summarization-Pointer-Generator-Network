Though the recession all but left the housing market on its knees, new home sales are being driven by an unlikely factor – the rise in demand for new, larger housing.

These houses - dubbed McMansions - are being built in order to appeal to homeowners who might be hesitant to buy a new home in feeble economic times.

Often over 3,000-square-feet, these homes also feature high ceilings, more space, and an overall luxury, but at the same price of other homes on the market.

Numbers released Wednesday shows rising sales and prices provided evidence that a housing market recovery was gaining some traction.

The housing sector has been the Achilles' heel of the economy ever since the home-price bubble burst. Data this week, however, has painted a relatively upbeat picture for the market and underscored the economy's resilience.

'The recent buoyancy in housing market activity has raised hopes that this beleaguered sector may finally be on the verge of a rebound,' said Millan Mulraine, senior macro strategist at TD Securities in New York.

New home sales increased 3.3 per cent to a seasonally adjusted 343,000-unit annual rate, the Commerce Department said on Wednesday. Compared with April last year, sales were up 9.9 per cent.

The report came on the heels of news on Tuesday that home resales hit a two-year high, with the sector getting support from investors who are increasingly seeing value.

Even more encouraging, the median price for both new and previously owned homes surged last month, a further sign of life for a market that has struggled to come back from its 2006 collapse.

The median price of a new home rose to $235,700 last month, up 4.9 per cent from a year ago.

While the data does not indicate the size of new homes built or sold, SmartMoney points out that the average square footage of any given home size has gone up – not down – in the recession, in part because developers are trying to attract potential buyers.

Despite the rise in sales, the market continues to be hamstrung by an oversupply of previously owned homes - especially from foreclosures, many of which sell well below their market value.

McMansions are large luxury houses that are found within subdivisions, often in suburbs. What they offer in space they lack in personality and architectural style, as many are made to blend into the ‘theme’ of the subdivision.

A typical McMansion boasts more than 3,000 square feet, though construction work is often shoddy or cheap.

Because the mansions are so large, developers cut corners with other things like insulation or distinguishing details.

They originated in California around the 1980s as a bridge between more modest suburban homes and luxurious estates.

Many homeowners chose to get rid of their large homes during the recession because they are expensive to heat and cool.

New home sales account for about 7.6 per cent of the overall housing market and face stiff competition from previously owned homes, even though builders are carefully managing inventory.

'As sales pick up, we should start seeing better levels of starts and that would mean more construction jobs,' said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pennsylvania.

'Nevertheless, with the all-clear sign on foreclosures now out, the pressure on the newly built portion of the market will remain high for a long time.'

While the inventory of new homes on the market rose 1.4 per cent to 146,000 units last month, it remained near record lows. At April's sales pace it would take 5.1 months to clear the houses from the market, down from 5.2 months in March.

New home sales last month were buoyed by a 28.2 per cent jump in the Midwest.

Sales in the Northeast rose 7.7 per cent, to the highest level in over a year, while in the West sales soared 27.5 per cent. Sales were down 10.6 per cent in the South.

A separate report from the Mortgage Bankers Association showed applications for loans to buy houses fell for a second straight week last week, even though mortgage rates dropped to a record low.

Signs of recovery in the housing market have spurred interest from some big-name investors. Oliver Chang, the head of U.S. housing strategy at Morgan Stanley, announced this week that he was departing to start a buy-to-rent housing fund.

The appetite for private label residential mortgage-backed securities has strengthened among investors rattled by broader market volatility.
