Prince Charles has fought back against speculation that he intends to be a ‘meddling monarch’.

In a rare move, his most senior aide has written a public letter rejecting claims that the Queen is concerned her son will be an ‘activist’ king.

A new biography, Charles: Heart Of A King by Catherine Mayer, says the prince wants a different model for his role as sovereign.

But in a letter to The Times, which is serialising the book, Charles’s principle private secretary William Nye calls the claims ‘ill-informed speculation’.

Charles, he insists, is ‘inspired’ by his mother’s example and understands the ‘necessary and proper limitations’ on the role of a constitutional monarch.

Clarence House declined to comment further, saying the letter ‘spoke for itself’ but it is clear it would not have been sent without the prince’s agreement.

Officials also stressed that ‘no one has any way of knowing the content of the private conversations between His Royal Highness and Her Majesty’.

Miss Mayer’s book, published today, portrays the prince as ‘driven by guilt’ and flying into fits of ‘royal rage’, leading some to dub his court ‘Wolf Hall’ – after Hilary Mantel’s best-selling novel about the court of Henry VIII. 

In his letter, published yesterday, Mr Nye says: ‘There has been ill-informed speculation recently, in your columns and elsewhere, about the attitude of the Prince of Wales to the role of sovereign.

‘His Royal Highness has always preferred not to comment on matters which relate to a future whose date is unknown and would arise only after the death of his mother.

‘In half a century in public life, few could be better placed than His Royal Highness to understand the necessary and proper limitations on the role of a constitutional monarch. 

'Should he be called to the throne, the Prince of Wales will be inspired by the examples of his mother and grandfather [George VI], while drawing also on his own experience of a lifetime of service.’

Sir, There has been ill-informed speculation recently, in your columns and elsewhere, about the attitude of the Prince of Wales to the role of sovereign. His Royal Highness has always preferred not to comment on matters which relate to a future whose date is unknown, and would arise only after the death of his mother.

After half a century in public life, few could be better placed than His Royal Highness to understand the necessary and proper limitations on the role of a constitutional monarch. Should he be called to the throne, the Prince of Wales will be inspired by the examples of his mother and grandfather, while drawing also on his own experience of a lifetime of service. He will seek to continue his service to this country and the other realms, to the Commonwealth and to the wider world.

Miss Meyer, editor at large for Time magazine, claims that she was given ‘remarkable access’ to Charles and secured ‘exclusive interviews’ with his inner circle.

Stung by the less-than-flattering portrayal of the prince, however, Clarence House made clear the book is not an official biography and claimed Miss Mayer exaggerated the level of access she enjoyed. 

Yesterday the author insisted her book was much more sympathetic to the prince than the extracts suggest.

A spokesman for Charles told the Mail at the weekend: ‘The Prince of Wales cares deeply about this country and has devoted most of his working life to helping individuals and organisations to make a difference for the better – and not for his personal gain. 

'He takes an active interest in the issues and challenges facing the UK and around the world through his own work and that of his charities.’

Vernon Bogdanor, professor of government at King’s College London, has dismissed claims the prince has already forfeited his political neutrality.

‘[Charles] might comment on matters which are controversial, but he has never done so in a party political way,’ he told the Mail. 

‘He knows what being monarch requires, and he will I am absolutely sure observe all the rules of constitutional monarchy.’
