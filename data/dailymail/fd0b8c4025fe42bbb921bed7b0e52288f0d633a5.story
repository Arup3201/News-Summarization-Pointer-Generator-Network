Gisela Triana, 48, says she's 'disappointed in herself' following her drunk driving arrest

A Texas judge has been arrested for drunk driving following a party with several local lawyers at a taping of 'Jimmy Kimmel Live' in Austin. 

Travis County civil judge Gisela Triana, 48, had an empty bottle of Mike's Hard Lemonade in the center console of her Chevy Suburban when she was pulled over for speeding Friday night, police said.

Triana has been on the bench since 1999, when she was appointed to fill the seat of another judge who resigned in the wake of a drunk driving arrest, according to the Austin Chronicle.

The judge told cops that she had been with several other Austin lawyers and judges at a taping of 'Jimmy Kimmel Live,' who was in town for South By Southwest.

The officer who pulled her over said she was driving 47mph in a 30mph zone. 

Police say Triana refused a breath test and claimed she had only four drinks before getting behind the wheel, the Austin American-Statesman reports. 

She claimed she had two drinks at the Jimmy Kimmel show and two more drinks at Zax Restaurant & Bar. She was pulled over less than two miles from the bar.

Triana allegedly could not walk a straight line during a field sobriety test. The officer said her eyes were glassy, she smelled of alcohol and slurred her words.

Triana says she was at a taping of 'Jimmy Kimmel Live' with several lawyer friends, including other judges. She claims she had four drinks throughout the night

Triana, a mother of four, was first appointed to the bench in 1999 to replace a judge who resigned over a drunk driving arrest

The cop took the judge in for a blood draw - the results of which are still pending. 

She was arrested and released the next morning on bail.

Triana, who is a former misdemeanor court judge and former prosecutor with the Travis County Attorney's Office, issued a statement saying she is 'disappointed in herself.'

'Regardless of the outcome of the pending investigation, I am very disappointed in myself and am sorry for any conduct that has made this legal process necessary. Whether it is determined that I was legally intoxicated or not, the investigation itself indicates that I have not met my own standards of careful conduct,' she said. 

The results of the blood test will determine whether Triana faces formal criminal charges.
