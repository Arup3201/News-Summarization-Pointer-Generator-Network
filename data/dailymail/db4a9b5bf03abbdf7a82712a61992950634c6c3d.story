Gareth Bale was in trouble again for not passing to a team-mate and then booed by a small section of the Bernabeu crowd after the Real Madrid star missed a string of chances on Saturday night

Other supporters in the stadium sang his name in support and both his manger Carlo Ancelotti, club director Emilio Butragueno and Real Sociedad manager David Moyes leapt to the player’s defence after the game.

Bale provided a superb assist for Karim Benzema in Real Madrid’s 4-1 win over Real Sociedad, a week after winning and scoring a last minute penalty to clinch a 2-1 victory at Cordoba.

But there was still a smattering of jeers inside the stadium on Saturday after he missed a one-on-one with Real Sociedad goalkeeper Geronimo Ruilli and then took a chance off the toe of James Rodriguez before putting the opportunity wide.

Rodriguez showed his frustration at Bale. But when the former Tottenham forward later squared to Benzema for him to score, the delighted Frenchman ran straight to Bale to celebrate.

Carlo Ancelotti said: ‘I don’t want anything more from Bale. He put in a great performance. It is true that he missed a couple of chances but he also provided a great assist to Benzema.’

Butragueno added: ‘Bale had a real presence in the game and in the way the team played. He could have scored several goals. Sometimes he gets it right, sometimes not but the importance is that he is creating the chances and is very involved.’

Real Madrid won with the suspended Cristiano Ronaldo watching from his private box. Bale came into the game having scored 11 goals in 11 games when Ronaldo has not been in the side alongside him but he couldn’t find away past Real Sociedad keeper Rulli.

David Moyes also defended him saying: ‘If he didn’t score them in this game then he will score them in the next one because he is a fantastic player.’
