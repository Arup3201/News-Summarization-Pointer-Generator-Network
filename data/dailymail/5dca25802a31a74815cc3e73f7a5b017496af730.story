A 60,000 tonne stone structure has been discovered at the bottom of the Sea of Galilee in Israel.

The giant cone-shaped cairn, which is made of basalt cobbles and boulders up to one metre long, has left archaeologists baffled as to its purpose and age.

Heavier than most modern-day warships, the structure is nearly ten meters high and 70 metres wide.

The structure, which is more than 200 meters below the surface of the water, is made from rocks stacked on top of each other

A 60,000 tonne stone structure has been discovered at the bottom of the Sea of Galilee in Israel

The Sea of Galilee is the largest freshwater lake in Israel - it is approximately 13 miles long and eight miles wide.

It has a total area of 64 square miles and a depth of 141 feet at its deepest point.

It is the lowest freshwater lake on Earth and it is fed partly by underground springs and partly by the Jordan River.

It was first discovered in 2003 by researchers carrying out a sonar survey of the sea, but divers have now been down to investigate further and have published their findings in the International Journal of Nautical Archaeology.

They believe that the structure, which is more than 20 meters below the surface of the water, is made from rocks stacked on top of each other which could indicate that it was design to mark a grave.

It is thought that it was made on land and then submerged as sea levels rose.

However, there is also a theory that it could have been created below the water as a fish nursery -similar smaller structures have been discovered in the past which were built for that purpose.

The researchers will now carry out underwater archaeological excavations in an attempt to find associated artefacts that could tell them more about it.

Researcher Dr Yitzhak Paz, of the Israel Antiquities Authority and Ben-Gurion University, told LiveScience that it could date back more than 4,000 years making it an Early Bronze Age artefact.

The giant cone-shaped cairn, which is made of basalt cobbles and boulders up to one meter long, has left archaeologists baffled as to its purpose and age (the map shows where it was found)

He said: ‘The most logical possibility is that it belongs to the third millennium B.C., because there are other megalithic phenomena [from that time] that are found close by.’

If it does prove to be from this era, then it could be connected to the city Bet Yerah which was one of the biggest sites in the area at the time.

Many
of Jesus's sermons were preached on the shores of the lake at a time 
when there was a string of villages around the water's edge.

In the time of the Byzantine Empire the lake's significance in Jesus's life made it a major destination for Christian pilgrims.

Its importance declined when the Byzantines lost control and the area came under the control of the Umayyad Caliphate.

At this time all of the major cities in the area, other than Tiberias, were abandoned.

In
1187, Saladin defeated the armies of the Crusades at the Battle of 
Hattin, largely because he was able to cut the Crusaders off from the 
valuable fresh water of the Sea of Galilee

Dr Paz told LiveScience: ‘It's the most powerful and fortified town in this region and, as a matter of fact, in the whole of Israel.’

While details about the structure remain sketchy, the researchers are confident that it was created by a well-organised society and that it’s building was a community effort.
