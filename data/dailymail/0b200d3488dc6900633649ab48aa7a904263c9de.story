Alan Dershowitz (above)  said the allegations against him are 'totally made up' and 'provably untrue'

A Harvard law professor named alongside Prince Andrew in his 'sex slave' case has said he is 'fighting back' against his accusers and is confident any success will help clear the royal's name.

Alan Dershowitz was named in court documents by a woman who says she was forced to have sex with friends of U.S. billionaire and convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein, including the Duke of York.

Professor Dershowitz has today said the allegations against him are 'not only totally made up' but also 'provably untrue' and is now challenging the claims with 'all the resources he can muster'.

He said the prince is not able to make the same kind of public defence as being a member of the Royal Family limits his freedom to pursue legal action.

But he added that any legal success he has against the woman - named by Buckingham Palace as Virginia Roberts - will work in the prince's favour as it will establish his accuser lacks credibility.

He has previously urged the Duke of York to fight back against claims the woman made that she was forced to have sex with the royal while she was a minor in the state of Florida.

She claims she had sex with the Prince, a former friend of Epstein, in New York, London and the U.S.Virgin Islands while she was a 'sex slave'. Buckingham Palace has denied all allegations.

Writing in The Times today, Professor Dershowitz, who was part of O.J. Simpson's 'dream team', sets out the accusations levelled against him, offering his alibi for each alleged encounter. 

In each instance, he explains what he was doing at the same time Jane Doe #3 - who was 17 at the time, making her a minor - has accused him of having a sexual encounter with her.

He pointed out that the woman claims they had sex on Epstein's Caribbean Island and at his New Mexico ranch, but Dershowitz said he had only ever been there briefly with his wife and daughter. 

In a third - when he is accused of having sex with Jane Doe #3 on a private plane - he said flight manifests would prove he was never on a private plane with her or any other under-age women.

Again, Dershowitz, who represented Epstein against sex crime charges, denies any sexual encounter with any under-age person.

These claims are included in a sworn statement filed by Dershowitz in a Florida court - one of a number of legal filings he has made in an attempt to publicly clear his name. 

Dershowitz is not currently a target of the latest proceedings but is seeking to intervene in order to defend himself. Buckingham Palace officials have denied the allegations against Prince Andrew. 

Dershowitz said any legal success he has against the woman - named by Buckingham Palace as Virginia Roberts (pictured with the prince) - will work in the royal's favour as it will discredit his accuser

Last week, Dershowitz filed defamation suits in both London and the U.S. based on the lawyers' public statements about the case and he urged Prince Andrew to do the same.

In them, he said the allegation against him was a 'deliberate lie.'   

He has also challenged his accuser and her lawyers to sign sworn statements repeating their charges.

Also last week, Dershowitz filed a motion in federal court to enter in a lawsuit brought against the U.S. government by his accuser and other women who say Epstein sexually abused them.

The court has yet to decide whether to grant his motion.

The two lawyers representing Jane Doe #3, former federal judge Paul Cassell and Florida plaintiffs attorney Bradley Edwards, have now filed counter-defamation charges against Dershowitz.

Dershowitz slammed his accuser's lawyers, Brad Edwards (left) and Paul Cassell (right), for naming him in the lawsuit. He claims that they failed to carry out proper investigations - which they have denied

In his article today, he explained that this will subject them and their client to sworn depositions. 

If they repeat the charges under oath, and if they are untrue, they will be subject to prosecution for perjury.

Finally, Dershowitz has also challenged his accuser to file formal rape charges against him. If she were to file a false rape charge, she would be committing a crime. She has not done so.

The lawyer said the prince's decision to pursue legal action - he has the right to sue his accuser - will depend on whether the Palace is willing to subject him to depositions about his private life.

But Dershowitz said his extensive legal action would be beneficial to Prince Andrew as it would serve to discredit his accuser.

It comes just days after Prince Andrew's ex-wife Sarah Ferguson slammed reports that he had sex with an underage girl as 'salacious lies' and defended him as a 'humongously good man'.

In a passionate rebuttal on the Today show on Tuesday, the Duchess of York said that she was standing by 'my best friend and my best ex-husband ever' amid the allegations.

Prince Andrew has come under fire over his friendship with convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein, who has been accused in court documents of supplying the royal with the underage girl. 

In a strongly-worded statement, a palace spokesman said: 'It is emphatically denied that the Duke of York had any form of sexual contact or relationship with Virginia Roberts.

'The allegations made are false and without any foundation.'
