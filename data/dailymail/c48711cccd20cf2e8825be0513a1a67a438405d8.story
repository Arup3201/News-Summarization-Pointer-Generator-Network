'One of life's beautiful people': New mother Kirsty Treloar was stabbed 29 times by violent ex-lover Myles Williams

A young mother was stabbed to death by her 'violent and controlling' ex-lover in front of their baby daughter, just hours after he promised not to hit her again.

Myles Williams, 19, broke into Kirsty Treloar's family home and stabbed her dozens of times on January 2 this year, after she told him she did not want to see him.

The teenager knifed his victim's sister and brother as they tried in vain to protect their 20-year-old sibling at the house in Hackney, east London, before dragging Miss Treloar into his car and driving away.

A court heard how Williams, of Clapton, pulled up when he came across a friend a short distance away and told him: 'I just stabbed my girl and she ain't breathing,' before casually smoking a cigarette.

He then dumped Miss Treloar's body behind some wheelie bins, abandoned his car and fled.

Mere hours before the attack, Williams had sent Miss Treloar - who had given birth to their daughter weeks earlier - a text message to tell her his new year's resolution was not to hit her again.

Williams is facing a life sentence after being found guilty of murdering the trainee nursery nurse following a trial at the Old Bailey.

The jury was told how the teenager sent a text to Miss Treloar on New Year's day which read: 'Okay wer all gud now and my new yrs ressy is that i aint going to hit u again and i won't hit u 4 this yr next yr the yr after that the next yr after that.'

Crispin Aylett QC, prosecuting, said of the message: 'This can only be described as a conditional new year's resolution. It ended the following morning.'

Miss Treloar - who had tried 'many 
times' to cut all ties with abusive Williams - replied to his text at 
6.30am on the morning of January 2 and told him she did not want to see 
him.

The teenager then
forced his way into her east London home and launched himself at Miss 
Treloar, who was holding their baby daughter.

After
hitting his ex-girlfriend several times Williams launched a frenzied 
knife attack, stabbing Miss Treloar 29 times and wounding her sister 
Gemma, 24, and brother Dean, 23, as they tried desperately to intervene.

The court heard how Gemma Treloar was stabbed in the arm as she pleaded with Williams not to take her sister - described by the Sheffield University student as 'one of life's beautiful people'.

When Dean Treloar tried to defend his sisters Williams stabbed him three times in the chest.

Williams then dragged his wounded ex-girlfriend to his car, drove a distance of two miles, then stopped to speak to a friend and buy cigarettes. The pair stood next to the car smoking before Williams dumped the young mother's body and fled.

The court was told how Williams and Miss Treloar met in early January 2011 while he was working sweeping the streets outside Hackney Job Centre.

Miss Treloar briefly moved in with the 19-year-old but the relationship quickly turned sour due to his 'violent and controlling' nature and she returned to the family home in Hackney.

In a witness statement read out in court, Miss Treloar's mother Pamela Dabney said her daughter had obtained a child care qualification and was looking forward to her life as a new mother and to working with children.

'Myles Williams has taken a decent, loving, close family and ripped us up,' she said.

'The last year of Kirsty's life was made a living hell by someone who was jealous of her relationship with her family and friends.

'Kirsty tried many times to cut all ties but unfortunately she felt she had no means of escape.'

Williams was found guilty of murdering Kristy Treloar and of wounding Gemma Treloar and Dean Treloar.

He is due to be sentenced on Wednesday.
