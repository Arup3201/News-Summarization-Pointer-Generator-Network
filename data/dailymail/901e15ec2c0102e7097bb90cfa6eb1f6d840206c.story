A proud grandmother delivered her daughter's baby at home on Christmas Day minutes after the family woke up to open presents.

Kath Boucher, 49, called round to see her pregnant daughter Leah Walters, 25, at 6am to share stockings before heading to the hospital.

But within an hour, they were lying on the hallway floor cradling the best present of all: 7lb 9oz baby Millie.

Within an hour, Leah, 25, was lying on the living room floor cradling 7lb 9oz Millie Holly after her mother called 999

Mrs Boucher said: 'It was very nerve-racking at the time - I knew nothing at all about delivering a baby.

'But the paramedics told me what to do down the phone and thankfully it all went very smoothly.

'The baby was breathing but she didn't cry so I turned her over and rubbed her back and she let out a little squeal.

'I also made sure the cord wasn't around her neck.

Ms Boucher said she was wracked with nerves as she called 999, knowing Millie (right) was on her way

The family had got up before sunrise with Leah's eldest daughter Ellie, seven, to open presents

By 7.10am, the family from Nelson, South Wales, were celebrating the best Christmas present ever

'The baby was the best Christmas present we could have wished for - and I'm proud to say I delivered her myself.'

Mrs Walters had woken up early on Christmas Day to open presents with her daughter Ellie, seven.

Nearing her due date, she and husband James, 19, had planned the day meticulously around visiting the hospital in case her waters broke.

But just minutes after waking up, Mrs Walters' contractions started.

The whole family is delighted by the surprise. James and Leah (right) were planning to go to the hospital

Chaos: They said it was hectic, with blankets and presents everywhere, and even a new baby

As the rest of the family panicked, grandmother Kath new they were too far along to go anywhere, and leaped into action.

She called 999 and following the guidance of paramedics over the phone, acted as midwife for her own daughter.

At 7.10am, baby Millie was born in the living room.

Mr and Mrs Walters, of Nelson, near Merthyr Tydfil in South Wales, gave her the middle name 'Holly' in a nod to the festive day.

Mrs Walters said: 'It was hectic - people were everywhere, presents were everywhere, baby stuff was everywhere.

'But my mum did a great job - she helped to give us the best Christmas present ever.'
