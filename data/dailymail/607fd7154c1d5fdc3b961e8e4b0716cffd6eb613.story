For alligator handler Jason McDonald, being mere inches from the jaws of alligators is all in a day's work.

But for those of us not quite so fearless, we can see what's it's like to wrestle one - without the danger - thanks to the GoPro he wore to capture this footage.

Mr McDonald wore the camera as he caught Bertha, a 10ft female gator who weighs 500lb, at the Colorado Gator Farm in Mosca, Colorado.

Experienced alligator handler Jason McDonald wore to GoPro to show what's it like to wrestle the creatures

Thanks to the camera, we can see the handler's point of view as as he caught 500lb female gator Bertha

He uses his hands to keep the gator's mouth shut and his whole body to hold the large creature down

In the clip, Mr McDonald approaches Bertha, the largest gator at Colorado Gator Farm, and holds her down

He is seem jumping on top of the large creature and using just his weight to hold her down.

The 34-year-old even opens the reptile's mouth with his hands while an awestruck crowd watch.

Mr McDonald, who treats and cares for the rescued animals, said he became involved with Colorado Gators 10 years ago, when he signed up for a wrestling class.

And his work at the farm is in stark contrast to his day job as a crematory manager. 

He said: 'I wanted to get a pet gator and I had heard that the farm offered classes.

Mr McDonald, pictured with Bertha, prefers the larger, but slower reptiles to the smaller ones who are faster

'I really enjoyed the rush I felt catching them and the experience of helping treat them for wounds and seeing them recover.'

Colorado Gators started out as a fish farm, but in 1987, its owners decided to buy 100 baby gators, as a means of disposing of guts and carcasses. 

'While we don't breed gators, we have saved over 200 and currently have a population of around 400,' he added.

Surprisingly, he has never sustained a serious injury from handling gators - and insists he prefers catching the larger ones compared to the smaller ones, which are more mobile. 

He said: 'The bigger gators the less flexible and much slower as they have more mass to move.

'Bertha is one of the original gators we got from Florida and she is extremely large - with the average size for a female being around eight foot.

'We have geothermal wells that keep the water hot - that's the reason we can have gators in one of the coldest places in the US - and it's also why we have such big and healthy gators.'
