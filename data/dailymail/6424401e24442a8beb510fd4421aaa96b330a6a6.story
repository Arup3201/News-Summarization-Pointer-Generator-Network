With autumn frosts well under way, it is hardly hosepipe ban season. Yet, just six weeks before Christmas, the public is being urged to ration its water use.

The year’s topsy-turvy weather has seen several counties remain in drought for months after the lowest rainfall on record.

Now water companies are urging householders to cut back on water use, amid concern that if reservoirs do not fill up, reserves could reach a critical level next summer.

The east of England had only half its usual rainfall in September and October, following the driest Spring for 80 years.

In March and April just one inch of 
rain fell – a fifth of what is normal for the season and about the 
typical level for North Africa.

Northamptonshire, Cambridgeshire and 
South Lincolnshire have had their driest year on record. Other 
drought-stricken areas are parts of Bedfordshire and Norfolk.

Anglian Water, which serves six 
million homes and businesses, yesterday applied to the Environment 
Agency for a permit to drain extra water from the River Nene to feed 
reservoirs in Pitsford and Rutland Water which are half-full.

It has applied to drain an extra 17million litres a day between December and April.

Spokesman Ciaran Nelson said: ‘You usually think of having to save water when it is hot.

‘But this is the time of year when we
need to save water the most as the reservoirs should be filling up 
ready for next spring.’

He said householders should take 
measures such as lagging pipes so they don’t freeze, as well as basics 
such as not keeping water running while brushing their teeth.

Farmers are also irrigating at night to reduce the amount of water evaporating.

Another spokesman for the firm explained: 'Last year's winter 
was the most severe since records began over 100 years ago. If that 
wasn't enough, we saw an average 20 per cent less winter rainfall in our supply 
region, followed by the driest spring in over 80 years.

'Despite these exceptional challenges we kept water supplies secure, and
by the start of spring we had replenished our reservoirs.

'However, 
through spring, rainfall remained exceptionally low, particularly in the
west of the region.

'If the dry conditions were to continue throughout this winter, storage 
levels at Pitsford would not recover and would remain very low.

'That's 
why we're taking prudent action now, applying for a drought permit to 
try to keep water supplies secure and customers' taps flowing.'

Environment Secretary Caroline Spelman: 'Despite our reputation as a rainy country, planning for unreliable rainfall is something we all need to do'

The last time such a permit was applied for during the autumn or winter months was in 2003, the Environment Agency said

David Hawley, a manager for the 
Agency, said: 'Balancing the needs of people, businesses and
the environment for water has been a difficult job this year.

'Farmers
have been working hard to make the best use of the water they have and 
we've been busy planning supplies and monitoring what's going on.

'But if we have a dry winter, this could make next year far more difficult for everyone than this year has been.

'That's
why we're asking everyone to look at their water use and see how it can
be reduced now so that there's enough to go around next year too.'

Environment
Secretary Caroline Spelman said: 'Farmers, water companies and other 
abstractors have worked really hard over the summer to help keep our 
rivers flowing and head off any threat of hosepipe bans.

'Northamptonshire
and South Lincolnshire are amongst a number of areas taking steps now 
to safeguard the water supply next summer and, despite our reputation as
a rainy country, planning for unreliable rainfall is something we all 
need to do.'
