A hiker who broke his leg in a deep ravine in rural Washington state on Tuesday was hoisted 420 feet to safety by firefighters.

The daring rescue saw emergency personnel lowered into the gorge below the aptly-named High Steel Bridge in Olympic National Forest - 110miles east of Seattle. 

Raymond Horton, 25, broke his leg sliding down an embankment along the Skokomish River on Tuesday.

Daring: The High Steel Bridge spans a 420-foot ravine in the remote Olympic National Forest in Washington

Rescuers used ropes to lower themselves into the ravine, and then hoisted the hurt hiker to the bridge above

The ravine is the equivalent of 42 stories deep - or three times the height of the Statue of Liberty

Firefighters determined that the safest and fastest way to get Mr Horton to safety was to lift him 420 feet - the equivalent of 42 stories - to the bridge above the ravine.

Incredible video footage from CBS News shows rescuers using ropes to lower themselves to the floor of the ravine.

One of the rescuers secured Mr Horton to himself via a harness. The rescuers were then lifted to High Steel Bridge, where he was taken to a local hospital.

Mr Horton suffered a broken leg and a few bumps and bruises, authorities say.

Rescuers rigged the injured man, identified as Raymond Horton, with a harness and attached him to one of the firefighters before hoisting him to safety

The High Steel Bridge was built by a logging company in 1929 and is the highest bridge in the state of Washington.

Three Statues of Liberty would have to stand toe to torch to reach the span from the floor of the ravine below. 

It was originally designed as a railroad to carry logging trains - but has since been converted to carry cars.

It is located in a remote part of Olympic National Forest, 20 miles from Shelton, Washington.
