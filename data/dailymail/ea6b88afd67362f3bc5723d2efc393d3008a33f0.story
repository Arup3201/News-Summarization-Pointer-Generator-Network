Manuel Pellegrini has challenged Manchester City star Sergio Aguero to prove he is one of the best players in the world by winning the Ballon d’Or.

Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi have shared the prestigious award between them for the last six years, but Pellegrini believes that Aguero can break their grip on the trophy if he stays fit.

The Argentina striker finished as City’s top scorer with 28 goals last season despite spending a third of the campaign on the sidelines, and has scored four in seven games so far even though he has started three of them on the bench.

Pellegrini said: ‘Aguero is among the best players in the world. Now it is up to him to make it and fight for the Ballon d'Or as best player, because he has all the qualities you can ask of a football player.

‘He is technically very strong, he is fast and has a lot of power. He is very intelligent, able to play in his position inbetween midfield and attack.

‘We hope we will see Sergio back in the form he demonstrated in the Premier League before his injuries hit him. I believe he will make a difference this season.’

Ahead of Tuesday night’s Champions League clash with Roma at the Etihad, Pellegrini also warned his players that they cannot afford to let their defence of the Premier League title suffer as they pursue success in Europe.

Pellegrini hopes his star man can challenge Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi for the top award 

‘It is important to progress in the Champions League, but not by forgetting the domestic league,’ he added. ‘We won’t focus all we have on the Champions League and see what happens in the Premier League.

‘If we can fight for the Premier League title and get further in the Champions League, that would be progress.

‘But if we have to leave behind the Premier League to win the Champions League, then for me that isn’t progress.’
