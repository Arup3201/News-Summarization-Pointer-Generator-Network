When the World Cup draw was made USA v Portugal looked a shoo-in for Cristiano Ronaldo’s team.

But after being crushed by Germany, relying too heavily on a not fully fit Ronaldo and with a crumbling squad Portugal could well be eliminated on Sunday.

And history shows that the USA - who can clinch qualification with a win - have a good record against the Portuguese.

So far it is two wins a piece in five encounters betweent the two sides. However, the Yankees have won the last two encounters including the 3-2 group stage victory during the World Cup 2002.

Spain seek to restore some pride against Australia on Sunday night but that won’t be easy against a Socceroo side who have been unlucky to lose both of their games against Holland and Chile.

And it’s not only the fallen world champions who face a period of transition with Barcelona also expected to experience some changes this summer.

Until recently, the Catalan giants were regarded as the best club team on the planet.

Xavi, who has for so long been the heart beat of Spain and Barcelona, is set to quit the La Liga club this summer and move to the USA or Qatar.

End of an era? Following Spain's horrendous World Cup campaign, Barcelona star Xavi looks set for a move

South Korea v Algeria - on air during ITV’s prime time slot at 8pm on Sunday - is hardly one to woo viewers. Even up against Antiques Roadshow or Casualty (There’s a few England jokes in there somewhere).

But it could be worth watching just to see blunder prone presenter Adrian Chiles come out with some crass joke about either country, or roll out an old gag like who the first Korean player to appear in the Premier League.*

For the record South Korea had three English-based players last season - recently-released Arsenal striker Park Chu-Young, who spent part of last term on loan at Watford last season, Bolton's Lee Chung-yong  and QPR's Yun Suk-young.

Algeria have two in Tottenham’s  Nabil Bentalab and Leicester’s Riyad Mahrez.

*It was of course Young Lee Sharpe of Manchester United (boom boom!)

Tim Cahill, scorer one of the greatest World Cup goals of all-time with his 'Van-Bastenesque' volley againjst Holland, bows out of international football on Sunday night in Australia's 'dead rubber' clash with Spain.

But it may not be the last we see of the 34 year-old midfield marauder. When he finishes the MLS season with New York Red Bulls I hear Cahill could be tempted back to the Premier League for one last hurrah. West Ham and QPR are interested.

Pick that one out: Tim Cahill netted possibly the best goal of the tournament so far in Porto Alegre

In an attempt to put a bright spin on it all at the post-mortem press conference Wayne Rooney suggested that England have a bright future ahead of them.

Not sure such soothing words were worth the headlines. After all what was he going to  say: 'It’s time to pack up, go home and turn of  of all the lights… we’re doomed.'

Some might have hoped he'd added: 'It’s now time to give the next generation a go… so I’m stepping aside. Good luck lads'

Here is a possible team to play at Euro 16… without Rooney.

Hart; Flanagan, Stones, Tomkins, Shaw; Barkley, Wilshere; Oxlade Chamberlain, Morrison, Sterling; Sturridge. And yours?

That said there is every chance that Wayne Rooney will be given the England captaincy.

But it understood an alternative is goalkeeper Joe Hart.

Talisman: Some might hope Wayne Rooney walks away from the national team but there is every chance he could be captain for England's Euro 2016 campaign

I-Say

The FA must surely review the near £2 million cost of their Brazil training camp which included a staggering support staff of 77… one for every three players.

Yet incredibly despite all the back up, luxury hotel and superb training pitch, I hear that some players still found time to complain about the drive time on the team bus from the hotel to the training ground. That was largely due to traffic.

The moans illustrate the pampered nature of yet another England squad at a major tournament where egos outweighed energy.

If one of the most high profile of the backroom staff, sports psychiatrist Dr Steve Peters, couldn’t solve that problem or confront the mental fragility of some of the players then his inclusion in the 'party' was a waste of time and money.

Bet of the Day

It’s been a high-scoring tournament so Belgium to beat Russia and four our more goals to be scored in the game is at 5-1… a decent price given Belgium are 10/11 to win.

Both South Korea and Algeria need to win - the unwanted draw is an attractive 21/10

World Cup moment

Ghana stole a march on Colombia with their dancing celebration after scoring against Germany.

So it's appropriate to pay homage to the man who started it all… Cameroon striker Roger Milla who, at the age of 42, took the 1990 World Cup storm with his goals and corner flag jives.
