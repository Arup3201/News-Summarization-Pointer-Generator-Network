She spent most of her recent holiday in Cornwall barefoot. But back in London and back to business, Samantha Cameron today chose to slip into some footwear that would let her hit the ground running. Literally.

The PM's wife stepped out today in a snazzy pair of Nike Air Max trainers, pairing the trendy £85 sport shoes with black trousers and a casual top.

Of course, SamCam
is no stranger to keep-fit wear. Both she and David are 
frequently seen on their bikes cycling around Westminster or working 
out with their personal trainer Matt Roberts.

But today, it looked like Samantha was wearing the shoe for aesthetic reasons rather than for any sort of sporting activity.

And she wouldn't be the first either.  The Air Max is no longer a shoe that is reserved for sport. Since its release in 80s, the chunky-soled trainer with its 
distinctive air pocket has been a stalwart in the Nike stable, with new models released regularly.

But this year the Air Max has really soared in popularity.

Helped
along by the recent surge in 80s and 90s fashions, the Air Max has been
seen on the feet of everyone from Rita Ora and Rihanna to Barack Obama.

Now it would be a crime to buy them in white when there are myriad finishes, patterns and prints available.

Proving she has her finger firmly on the fashion pulse, SamCam went for camouflage with neon orange flashes.
