Prince Andrew was tucked away with his closest friends and family in an opulent £22,000-a-week Swiss chalet when the sex scandal broke.

The Queen's son heard news of the serious challenge to his reputation while staying in the exclusive ski resort of Verbier with his former wife Sarah Ferguson and their younger daughter Eugenie.

Prince Harry’s ex-girlfriend Cressida Bonas, a close friend of Eugenie, and Eugenie's boyfriend, nightclub boss, Jack Brooksbank were also staying with the family.

Located in one of the most exclusive and remote parts of Verbier, the chalet boasts seven bedrooms, its own heated indoor swimming pool with an opulent entertaining area and a sauna.

Prince Andrew  was staying at a £22,000-a-week ski chalet when news of the sex scandal broke. He was seen leaving the mountain retreat with his daughter Eugenie yesterday afternoon ahead of his flight back to Britain

The Duke has used the chalet to host his own birthday parties in previous years and it is also the location where Prince Harry romanced Miss Bonas.

The 54-year-old Duke of York is understood to have paid for the hire of the chalet out of his own private fortune.

Looking pensive and deep in thought, he left the chalet yesterday afternoon and was driven to a nearby airport where he boarded a private plane back to Britain with Eugenie, 24, and her boyfriend Jack Brooksbank.

During Prince Andrew's most-recent stay, the royals were guarded by five protection officers – funded by taxpayers – who regularly drove them to the ski lifts and to restaurants.

The grand, old-fashioned wooden chalet hired by the Queen’s son boasts an extensive terrace area with stunning views of the Swiss Alps.

The master bedroom has its own en-suite bathroom and is draped in fur throws. It also boasts a sumptuous living room, littered with antiques and artworks, in which a roaring fire is lit each afternoon to welcome guests home from a hard afternoon on the slopes.

Afternoon tea and cakes are provided by the property’s on-site chef.

In February 2013 Prince Harry was spotted hugging Cressida on the nearby ski slopes and the pair are understood to have shared a room at the chalet.

Harry splashed out £300 on a pair of designer snow boots for Cressida during that trip.

As well as a sauna and party room, the huge chalet boasts a swimming pool with windows onto the snow

And although the pair have since split, Cressida was invited back for the most-recent trip because she remains a close friend of Eugenie’s.

The chalet where the group stayed also has its own ski changing room so visitors can ski from the slopes to the privacy of their own home, without mixing with hoi polloi.

The piece de resistance, however, has to be its 650 foot square pool room with floor to ceiling windows offering unrivalled views out over the mountains.

This stunning room has its own bar where the royals have held several lively house parties on previous visits. 

In the same year Sarah Ferguson lost more than two stone during a 12-week stay at the chalet.

The Duchess of York showed off a svelte figure after embarking on a relentless regime with her personal trainer Josh Salzmann.

The 55-year-old stuck to a strict diet of blended foods and intensive workouts, including daily running and mountain hikes.

At the time the mother-of-two said: ‘I went up to the mountains, and I ran every day. That’s how I got fit.’

Prince Harry has often visited the chalet and was spotted there with ex-girlfriend Cressida Bonas last year

The Duchess is understood to have stayed behind at the chalet after Andrew and Eugenie left yesterday.

Like her former husband, she too has kept a low profile since the under-age sex scandal broke on Friday.

Prince Andrew and Fergie married in 1986 but separated in 1992 and divorced four years later. But they have remained on good terms and have brought up their daughters together.

Commenting on their relationship earlier this year, Andrew said: 'I just see it as illogical not to be a friend at the end of the day, regardless of what your circumstances are.'

Princess Eugenie is believed to have met long-term boyfriend Jack Brooksbank while stating at the Swiss ski resort four years ago.

The son of an accountant, Jack was educated at £10,000-a-term Stowe school in Buckinghamshire and at one point considered a career in the City. But, with the support of his parents, he chose to work in hospitality.

He took a job at Chelsea’s Admiral Codrington, a pub and private dining room, before being poached by Piers Adam to work at The Markham Inn, also in Chelsea, where he spent three years 

He recently took a job helping to manage the tropical island-themed Mahiki in Mayfair.
