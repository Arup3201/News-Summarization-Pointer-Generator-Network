Uruguay spoiled Javier Aguirre's debut as Japan coach, after beating the Asian champions 2-0 in a friendly on Friday.

Edinson Cavani gave the visitors, without the suspended Luis Suarez, the lead in the 34th minute, taking advantage of poor defending by Tatsuya Sakai and beating goalkeeper Eiji Kawashima with a sliding kick.

Another weak defensive clearance allowed Abel Hernandez, who became Hull's record signing after completing his £9.5million switch to the KC Stadium on deadline day, to make it 2-0 in the 71st minute with a close-range effort through the legs of Kawashima.

Japan's best chance came with three minutes remaining when Yoshinori Muto hit the post with a left-footed shot from the edge of the area.
