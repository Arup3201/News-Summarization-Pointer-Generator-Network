Rugby league great and one of the Palmer United Party's star recruits, Senator Glenn Lazarus, is on the back foot today amid claims he has been ripping off information from Wikipedia to inform followers about his state of Queensland.

The accusations of plagiarism stem from his personal website senatorlazarus.com, where details about the state's primary industries appear to have been simply cut and pasted onto his page.

Local media reports suggests the new senator has been sidestepping questions about his party leader's controversial comments about China.

Senator Glenn Lazarus, the footballer they called 'the brick with eyes' is now in the eye of a political storm amid allegations he has plagiarised Wikipedia's Queensland website

The Courier Mail in Queensland reports that Senator Lazarus has refused to respond to questions about Australia’s economic future, what his plans for the state were and the comments made by party leader Clive Palmer and fellow Senator Jacqui Lambie.

As a Senator, Glenn Lazarus, enjoys a base salary of more than $195,000 plus a raft of entitlements including travel.

It's been a tough initiation for one-time football great, heckled during his maiden speech, accused of going to ground by sections of the media and now this.

It remains unclear as to who actually posted the content for the 'About Queensland' dropdown on his website.

And the words used to describe the role of the Senate and a member's role in it, strike a remarkably close resemblance to the details provided on the site of South Australia's Independent Senator, Nick Xenophon.

What a week to forget for the Palmer United Party. Clive Palmer (right) and Senator Jacqui Lambie have been embroiled in the war of words of Australia's relationship with China and now PUP Senate leader Glenn Lazarus is in hot water

The following are the second and third paragraphs on Senator Lazarus' website:

'Queensland is the largest state and the third most populated with a population of some 4,560,059 people. The capital and largest city in the state is Brisbane, Australia’s third largest city. Referred to as the ‘Sunshine State’, Queensland is home to 10 of Australia’s 30 largest cities and is the nation’s third largest economy.

The state was named in honour of Queen Victoria, who on 6 June 1859 signed Letters Patent separating the colony from New South Wales. The date 6 June is now celebrated state-wide as Queensland Day. Queen Victoria, who went on to become Britain’s longest reigning monarch, chose an eponymous name for the colony over Cooksland, which had been suggested by the influential local Presbyterian minister John Dunmore Lang in honour of navigator James Cook. Queensland achieved statehood with the Federation of Australia on 1 January 1901.'

Palmer United Party senators Jacqui Lambie (left) and Glenn Lazarus are making headlines for the wrong reasons

Before entering politics in 2013 with the Palmer United Party, Glenn Lazarus (pictured playing for NSW against Queensland) enjoyed a stellar rugby league career, considered one of the code's greatest players

And the following are excerpts from Queensland - Wikipedia:

'Queensland (abbreviated as Qld) is the second-largest and third-most populous state in Australia.

'Queensland has a population of 4,560,059, concentrated along the coast and particularly in the state's South East.

'The capital and largest city in the state is Brisbane, Australia's third largest city.

'Referred to as the 'Sunshine State', Queensland is home to 10 of Australia's 30 largest cities and is the nation's third largest economy.

'The state was named in honour of Queen Victoria, who on 6 June 1859 signed Letters Patent separating the colony from New South Wales. The date 6 June is now celebrated state-wide as Queensland Day. Queen Victoria, who went on to become Britain's longest reigning monarch, chose an eponymous name for the colony over Cooksland, which had been suggested by the influential local Presbyterian minister John Dunmore Lang in honour of navigator James Cook. Queensland achieved statehood with the Federation of Australia on 1 January 1901.'

Apart from some re-ordering of sentences, there appears to be very little differentiation between the two pages. Reading further, there are arguably too many similarities to be a coincidence.

As the Queensland Wikipedia site appears today

The words on the Queensland page of the Glenn Lazarus site senatorlazarus.com strikes a remarkable resemblance to those on Wikipedia (top)

With Senator Lazarus now facing the first real test of his political career, questions are being asked whether the pressure will prove too much to bear, as was the case for his former football team-mate Mal Meninga.

Meninga, another rugby league great who starred for the Canberra side, is remembered for perhaps the country's most short-lived of political careers. In September 2001, just a few days after deciding he would run as an Independent in the ACT elections, he pulled out of the race while in his first political interview, saying quite simply: 'I'm buggered, I'm sorry. I have to resign'.

Daily Mail Australia has sought comment from Senator Lazarus about the allegations but is yet to receive a response.

@highlight

He's the Palmer United Party (PUP) leader in the Senate

@highlight

Almost 500 words appear to have been lifted from the Wikipedia site onto his own to describe his home state of Queensland

@highlight

Claims too that the description of the role of Senate and those voted into it, are replicated from the site of fellow Senator, South Australian Independent Nick Xenophon

@highlight

Continues a week of woe for the PUP, the much-publicised newcomers to Australian politics, after Clive Palmer's scathing criticism of China and Jacqui Lambie's assertions on the same issue

@highlight

Glenn Lazarus entered politics just last year to head PUP's Senate ticket and was voted in on less than 10% primary votes

@highlight

Lazarus won rugby league premierships with three different clubs - Canberra, Brisbane and Melbourne
