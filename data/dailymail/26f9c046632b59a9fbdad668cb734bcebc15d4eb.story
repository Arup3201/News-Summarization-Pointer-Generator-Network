A new light bulb which can be controlled from your smartphone has launched after raising million in crowdfunding in just six days. 

The LIFX is much more than just illumination.

It will also be Wi-Fi enabled, have multiple colors, and an LED light bulb, all of which can be controlled with a tap on your smartphone.

The bulb also promises a 25 year life span, and is installed as easily as replacing your current light bulb.

An app to control the light bulb can be downloaded at no charge.

A single bulb retails on the company's site for $99 while a pack of four can be purchased for $380.

Users can match the bulb's color to match their mood, set a timer to turn the lights on in the morning without getting out of bed, and even match your home's mood to your playlist.

'Your light switch needs to remain on for the smartbulb to be accessible with the LIFX app,' the Kickstarter noted. 'However you can use any light switch to turn your smartbulbs on and off like you do with traditional bulbs.'

The prototype puts out illumination equivalent to a roughly 60 watt incandescent bulb or a 50 watt halogen downlight.

The LIFX took Kickstarter by storm  and was successfully funded by September 2012 without any marketing or PR help, says co-founder Phil Bosua.

Still, more than 9,200 backers were so intrigued by the idea that they were happy to contribute some cash.

'It was probably a combination of many things,' Bosua told the I Can Be Society. 'If I had to pick one, I'd say through LIFX, people discovered a new way to look at the light bulb. We wanted to create a light bulb that was fit for today's connected world very different from a traditional light bulb that had not really been innovated in over 100 years.'
