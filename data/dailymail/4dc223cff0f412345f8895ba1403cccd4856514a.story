One of three pro footballers named by a woman who 'blacked out' in a hotel suite had called 911 to say she was naked and refusing to leave, according to a newly-revealed police report.

San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick, 26, blasted claims he was being investigated for sexual assault as 'completely wrong' after his name appeared in a Miami police report.

Now a second report has emerged which appears to show Seattle Seahawks wide receiver Ricardo Lockette - another of the trio - had already called police about the 25-year-old woman on the night of the incident.

Fresh information: A new report appears to show Seattle Seahawks wide receiver Ricardo Lockette (right) had already called 911 about a woman in the hotel suite of 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick (left)

Scene: Police were called to an apartment in the luxury Viceroy Hotel and Spa in the early hours on April 2

The report, revealed by Miami talk show host Andy Slater, said the woman was 'completely naked laying on comp(lainant)'s friend's bed ref(using) to leave'.

A crisis intervention team was dispatched and arrived at the luxury Viceroy hotel at less than 20 minutes later, the report said.

The woman was then taken to hospital - by the Miami Fire Department.

Miami Fire Lt Ignatius Carroll told the Miami Herald: 'At 12:32, Miami Fire Rescue was dispatched to the Viceroy and transported a 25-year-old female from the Viceroy to the Jackson Memorial Hospital emergency room.'

The trio made headlines last week when their names appeared in Miami Police's previous report.

It carried her claim that she
 had woken up in hospital saying she was unable to remember how she got 
there after spending time with Mr Kaepernick, Mr Lockette, 27, and 49ers
 wide receiver Quinton Patton, 23.

Under the spotlight: San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick, 26, was named in the report

Denial: The football player issued a three-part statement on Twitter after allegations around sexual assault

Denial: Mr Kaepernick wrote that he takes 'great pride in who I am and what I do' and people invented facts

Heartfelt: He finished by thanking fans and saying 'I assure you that your faith is not misplaced'

The report said her last memory was of being naked on Mr Kaepernick's bed at an apartment in the Viceroy after drinking and smoking marijuana in his company.

Noting that she had a 'sexual relationship with Mr Kaepernick in the past', the report said the trio watched a basketball game but the woman went to a bedroom to lie down after feeling 'light headed'.

Kaepernick then came into the bedroom and kissed her and undressed her, leaving her naked - before walking out and saying he would return, it continued.

She was waiting in bed naked when the two other players allegedly peeked inside the room, to which she replied: 'What are you doing? Where is Colin? Get out!'

She said the men left - and she could not remember what happened after that.

Investigation: Quinton Patton, pictured right with Kaepernick, was also named in the police report

Star footballer: Colin Kaepernick, quarterback for the San Francisco 49ers, was named in the report

However, speaking after the report was revealed, a police spokesman said: 'There's no evidence of a crime or a sexual assault. This report is simply an incident report taken at the woman's request.'

Mr Kaepernick spoke out on Twitter on Friday to deny claims, first reported by TMZ, that he was being investigated for sexual assault.

'The charges made in the TMZ story and other stories I’ve seen are completely wrong,' he wrote. 'They make things up about me that never happened.

'I take great pride in who I am and what I do, but  I guess sometimes you have to deal with someone who makes things up.

'I want to thank all of the people who have shared their encouraging sentiments. I assure you that your faith is not misplaced.'
