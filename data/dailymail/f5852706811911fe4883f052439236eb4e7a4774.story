Do you always take the lift rather than climb that flight of stairs? Or struggle to eat any fruit or veg?

If so, you could be dramatically increasing your risk of cancer - and using the quiz below, you will be able to gauge by how much.

There is strong scientific evidence to suggest that lifestyle is a big factor when it comes to developing cancer.

Scientists say about 89,000 cases of cancer could be avoided if we took measures such as eating a healthy diet that includes a variety of fruit and vegetables, wholegrains and pulses

Just today it was announced there has been a steep rise in rates of lifestyle-linked cancers in England.

Liver cancer rose substantially over the past decade - by 70 per cent among men and 60 per cent among women between 2003 and 2012, according to new figures by the Office for National Statistics (ONS).

Rates of malignant melanoma, the most dangerous form of skin cancer, have risen by 78 per cent among men and 48 per cent among women over the same period.

The main causes of liver cancer are tobacco, infections with hepatitis B and C ,and excess alcohol consumption.

But being
 physically active, maintaining a healthy weight and eating a diet rich 
in plant foods, such as cereals, pulses, fruit and vegetables, have all
 been proven to cut the risk of developing cancer,  scientists at World 
Cancer Research Fund say.

Kate Mendoza, the organisation’s Head of Health Information at the charity, said many people still don’t realise that the way that they live – from what they have for breakfast to how active they are – could help save them 
from developing the devastating disease.

She added that about 89,000 
cases of cancer could be avoided if we ate a healthy diet that includes a variety of fruit and vegetables, 
wholegrains and pulses, were as physically active as we could be and maintained a healthy weight.

This includes 20,100 bowel cancer cases, 
21,000 breast cancer cases and 8,300 prostate cancer cases.

Now the charity has developed a short quiz that can show you whether your 
lifestyle is helping protect you from cancer - or increasing your risk.

It asks about your job, your shopping habits, what you eat and 
other lifestyle choices, before estimating whether you need to make any 
changes to help reduce your risk of the disease - and advising what these should be.

Ms Mendoza added: 'Even small changes to lifestyles can make a big difference.

'It can be confusing knowing what to do to avoid developing cancer, but our research has shown that there are some clear choices people can make to help protect themselves against the disease.'

PHYSICAL ACTIVITY QUIZ

The World Cancer Research Fund’s top recommendations for cancer prevention are:

Be a healthy weight – Be as lean as possible without becoming underweight

Physical activity – Be active for at least 30 minutes a day

Plant foods – Eat a variety of vegetables, fruits, wholegrains and pulses

Energy
 density – Avoid sugary drinks and limit consumption of energy-dense 
foods (particularly processed foods that are high in fat, low in fibre, 
or high in sugar)

Meat – To reduce your cancer risk, eat no more than 500g (cooked weight) per week of red meat, like beef, pork and lamb, and avoid processed meats such as ham, bacon, salami, hot dogs and some sausages. As a rough guide 500g of cooked red meat is the same as 700 to 750g of raw red meat.

Alcohol – Limit alcoholic drinks to two for men and one for women a day

Salt –Salt is linked to 14 per cent of stomach cancer cases in the UK. Our daily intake of salt should be less than 6g (2.4g sodium) – we actually need much less than this.

Supplements – Don’t rely on supplements to protect against cancer

Breastfeeding – Best for mothers to breastfeed exclusively for up to six months and then add other liquids and foods

Cancer survivors – Those who have survived cancer should follow these recommendations for cancer prevention where possible.
