There was mounting anger on Tuesday night as the prospect of franchise-based professional rugby union moved a step closer with former London club Wasps completing a multi-million pound purchase of Coventry City’s Ricoh Arena.

One Wasps stalwart described the move, which will see the two-time European Cup winners leave their current Adams Park ground in High Wycombe and relocate to the 32,000-seat stadium next season, as ‘crossing a red line’ while posts on social media predicted a ‘toxic’ atmosphere at this Sunday’s Aviva Premiership clash with Bath.

Rob Smith, who spent 40 years at the club as a player and then a coach, said: ‘I want the club to be financially secure, but there is a time when you draw the line and say I prefer the club to stay even if that means going down the leagues rather than be transported elsewhere. You get so attached to a club and stay with them. Coventry isn’t a million miles away but it might as well be.’

The move to Coventry, two years after Wasps were saved from bankruptcy by businessmen David Thorne and Derek Richardson, has sparked fury among Wasps fans, who feel betrayed after early promises of a move back to their original north-west London base.

Mailsport understands Wasps are also set to announce a new sponsorship deal worth close to £500,000 with Jaguar Land Rover, whose global headquarters are in Whitley on the outskirts of the city, but no amount of financial sugar-coating can appease diehard fans.

As the local council was braced to rubber-stamp the move, Wasps fans took to social media websites to discuss possible protests at this Sunday’s Adams Park fixture against Bath with a growing sense they have been let down by the RFU and Premier Rugby.

One Wasps fan @thewaspsblog tweeted: ‘Atmosphere on Sunday at Adams Park is going to be toxic’ while another post read ‘what a sad day to be a Wasps fan’.

Despite the fans’ anger, the move is a commercial necessity less than two seasons after Wasps’ financial situation became so dire that players sometimes went unpaid as the club was unable to meet the monthly wage bill.

With average attendances of only around 6,000 at Adams Park, where Wasps have played their home fixtures for 12 years, the Ricoh move will see the club attempt to build an almost entirely new fan-base in a catchment area historically targeted by the likes of Leicester, Northampton and Worcester.

 Councillors also confirmed in the meeting that Wasps plan to build a new training base in the city

 ‘It’s an odd one,’ said Leicester director of rugby Richard Cockerill. ‘From what I understand, they are staying in Acton and will recruit from that area.

‘They will just travel 100 miles for their home games!

‘I am from Coventry so it’s going home for me. Another game down the M69 instead of going to Wycombe? Perfect.’

Professional Game Board regulations mean Wasps are unable to move their academy to the Coventry area but moves are already afoot to build a new training ground close to the Ricoh with plans to relocate their current Twyford Avenue facility in Acton within three years.

On Tuesday night it was unclear how, if at all, Wasps players and backroom staff, who signed contracts to live and work in London, will be compensated for being asked to move 100 miles north.

‘We will be watching the Wasps situation with considerable interest,’ said Rugby Players Association chairman and former Wasps player Damian Hopley. ‘It will be fascinating to see how it pans out.

‘Will Wasps play in Coventry but still train in Acton? That is important because players have families, mortgages and children in local schools.

‘It would be madness not to consider the implications of what is being proposed. Personally, I’m a sentimentalist and find talk of a move quite sad.’

The club is set to hold a press conference on Wednesday.
