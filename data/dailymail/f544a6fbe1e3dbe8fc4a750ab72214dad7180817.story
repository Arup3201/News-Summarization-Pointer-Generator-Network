It's fairly commonplace for a mother to do her daughter's hair, but one particularly talented mom has made a name for herself thanks to her very unique styles.

Mindy McKnight, from Salt Lake City, Utah, told Today.com that parents always used to ask how she styled the hair of her twin girls Brooklyn and Bailey, now 14, in such an elaborate way.

So she began posting instructional videos online, which caught the attention of so many parents that she now has her very own channel called Cute Girls Hairstyles, with more than 1.6million subscribers.

Despite her videos' incredible popularity, Mrs McKnight - who has five daughters and one son - says her intention was never to reach a wide audience or make money from her talent.

'I am a mom,' she said. 'My point was to document hairstyles and [I] 
thought it would be a cute way for my girls to have it. I had no idea it
 would resonate with so many people.'

But resonate it did; a video for her most popular hairstyle, the waterfall braid, has been viewed more than 23million times.

The 'do involves creating a braid along the crown of the head, with pieces of hair that hang down like a waterfall.

Surprise success: 'I am a mom,' she said. 'My point was to document hairstyles and [I] thought it would be a cute way for my girls to have it. I had no idea it would resonate with so many people'

Big family: Mrs McKnight and her husband hhave six children, two of whom were adopted, giving her plenty of practice and time to hone her hairstyling skills

Other popular styles are the Katniss, named after the Hunger Games character, and the Ponytail Bow, a cute and back-to-school-friendly update on the Lady Gaga bow.

Mrs Knight writes on her website that she first came up with the basic idea for Cute Girls Hairstyles in 2001, when her oldest daughters were 18 months old.

She said she quickly became tired of the typical 'waterspout' pigtails often used on toddlers, so she began trying out new hairdos.

Runs in the family: Now, even Mrs McKnight's husband Shaun is getting in on the hairstyling activities, starring in videos in the 'Daddy Do's' section, which provides instructions on how to do slightly simpler styles

In the following years, she and her husband had four more children, two of whom were adopted, giving her plenty of practice and time to hone her hairstyling skills.

Now, even Mrs McKnight's husband Shaun is getting in on the hairstyling activities, starring in videos in the 'Daddy Do's' section, which provides instructions on how to do slightly simpler styles.

Throughout all their success, Mr and Mrs McKnight have continued to prioritize their family, and to remember how their popularity came about in the first place.

'It's just mostly a cute story (about) a mom and a family doing our thing,' she said.
