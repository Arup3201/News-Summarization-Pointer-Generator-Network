Three years after their first transatlantic visit, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are returning to the US.

The Mail on Sunday can reveal that William and Kate – who visited Los Angeles shortly after their wedding in 2011 – will embark on a three-day trip to New York next month to unveil their new charity, United For Wildlife.

And it seems likely they will take 16-month-old Prince George with them.

Pregnant Kate, who was forced to withdraw from a visit to Malta in September because she was suffering from acute morning sickness, has now been cleared to travel 

She is said to be 'very excited' about the forthcoming trip – her first visit to the city – having been desperate to see New York since she was a young girl.

The Duke and Duchess will meet conservationists to discuss illegal poaching and will also sit down with officials from international charities, including the World Wildlife Fund. 

A spokesman for the charity said: 'We will be in New York to talk about our Wildlife Crime Project, which is why the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are involved.'

The couple's representatives from United For Wildlife have just returned from a reconnaissance trip and an announcement about the visit will be made imminently.

'Kate has never been to New York and she is really looking forward to it now that she is over her illness,' a source tells me.

Another source adds: 'Kate was upset she had to cancel her tour of Malta, but now she is over her morning sickness and really excited about America.'

Kate visited an oil refinery in Wales yesterday, her modest baby bump just visible beneath her elegant double-breasted sky-blue wool coat.

She was at the Valero facility in Pembrokeshire with Prince William to mark the 50th anniversary of its opening.

She is due to make two public appearances this week – the Royal Variety Performance at the London Palladium on Thursday, and a reception for her charity Place2Be.

A Palace spokesman said: 'Any overseas visit will be announced in the usual manner in due course.'
