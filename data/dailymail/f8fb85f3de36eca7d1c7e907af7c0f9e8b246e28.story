Midfielder Darren Ambrose has re-signed for Ipswich Town, 11 years after being sold by the club for £1million to Newcastle.

The 30-year-old was a free agent after leaving Birmingham at the end of last season, and has signed an initial deal that runs until January.

He had spent the last three weeks training with Mick McCarthy's side, who currently sit 19th in the Championship with five points after just one win in five games.

This will be Ambrose's third spell at Portman Road after he made nine appearances for the club on loan in 2008-09.
