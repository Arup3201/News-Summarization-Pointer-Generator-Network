Bosses at the FBI-style agency shut down last year for failing to catch ‘Mr Bigs’ have shared massive payoffs and bonuses.

One senior executive at the Serious Organised Crime Agency (SOCA) chose to resign but was still rewarded with more than £200,000 – and has now walked into a well-paid job in another policing body.

Meanwhile, the head of the discredited unit – accused of letting crime barons off the hook and failing to investigate a hacking scandal – was handed a £12,500 bonus.

Last night the Home Office was facing calls to explain why it had rubber-stamped the payments at a time when forces are having to cut bobbies on the beat to save money.

Keith Vaz MP, chairman of the Home Affairs Select Committee, told The Mail on Sunday: ‘In a time of austerity it is unacceptable to use taxpayers’ money to reward those leaving an organisation that had been accused of under-performance and failure to achieve objectives.

‘We have made it clear a number of times that the public will not accept senior figures in policing who leave one job and obtain a huge amount of money, before going on to take up another publicly-funded job in the same area.’

Police Federation chairman Steve White said: ‘At a time of severe cuts which have put the entire service under strain and affected the pay of all police officers and staff, it seems farcical that huge sums of public money are used to pay off already well-paid executives.’

SOCA was set up in 2006 as a national force to tackle the growing threats of drug smuggling, human trafficking and fraud run by crime syndicates.

But a whistleblower told The Mail on Sunday it had decided it was ‘too difficult’ to catch its top targets.

Then, it emerged that in 2008 the agency had a list of 102 organisations and individuals suspected of employing rogue private investigators to use illegal methods such as phone-hacking against rivals and customers – but failed to act.

The ‘blue-chip hacking scandal’ led, last year, to the resignation of SOCA’s chairman Sir Ian Andrews, who failed to declare he had set up a private company with his wife, who also worked for a security firm.

In October SOCA was taken over by the National Crime Agency, but the final set of accounts, published last week, show many of its top bosses were handsomely rewarded as the failed agency was abolished.

Malcolm Cornberg, who earned £150,000 as its Executive Director Capability and Service Delivery, resigned last July but was given  a payoff worth £189,600 ‘which was agreed with and funded  by the Home Office’. He also received a payment in lieu of leave of £14,100.

Last month he joined the College of Policing as Director of Corporate Services on a salary of £115,000.

Two other SOCA directors, Gerry Liddell and Bradley Jones, received compensation payments of £184,500 and £82,400, respectively, and director-general Trevor Pearce got a £12,500 bonus.

He was accused of treating Parliament with ‘absolute contempt’ by giving different accounts of when SOCA took action in the industrial espionage case.

A spokesman for the Home Office said: ‘The settlement  with Malcolm Cornberg was reached in accordance with  Treasury rules.’
