Mary Evans, who was last night stabbed to death in Luton. Her brother-in-law has been arrested for her murder

A 70-year-old woman has been stabbed to death in her car just yards from her home.

Mary Evans, who remarried six weeks ago, was attacked on the way to pick up her grandson from school.

Neighbours heard shouting and raced outside to see a man with a blade and her slumped at the wheel of her crashed car.

Two of them brought the knifeman to the ground while others tried to save Mrs Evans’s life.

She was pronounced dead by paramedics and police who had raced to her bungalow in Luton.

Last night a relative said she understood Mrs Evans had stopped her car when a man flagged her down.

‘All we know is that there was an argument and Mary was screaming,’ she said.

‘The neighbours on the street were fantastic. Two people stopped him from running off and kept the knife for police as well as calling the ambulance.’

Friends said Mrs Evans, a retired cashier known as May, had finally found happiness with her third husband David, who she had lived next door to for 20 years.

She had lost her second partner in 2007, a son to spina bifida in 2003 and two other children in infancy.

Mrs Evans, who was a volunteer at the local hospital, was described by her younger sister as a very caring person.

Shirley Vincent told ITV Anglia: ‘She 
was my big sister and she liked to be called the matriarch of the 
family, being the eldest.

'She
 could be quite odd – but she didn’t like to think she was an old lady, 
she was 70. She lived for her daughter and her grandson. She was there 
for everybody.’

A local 
resident, Punita Sonagra, 37, said: ‘She was a big inspiration as a 
person of her age looking after so many people. I feel sad.’

A man in his 50s was last night being held on suspicion of murder.

Neighbour
 Punita Sonagra said: 'May was really happy after a long time. She had a
 disabled son who passed away and her husband had some problems and he 
died too. She had a daughter and grandchild and she always helped out.

'She
 was a big inspiration as a person of her age looking after so many 
people.I feel sad. Nobody deserves to be treated like that.

'She has suffered all her life. Where is the justice? That she has been treated like that, really upsets me.'

Mrs Evans was treated by paramedics at the scene but was pronounced dead shortly afterwards

This morning one resident described the scene: 'I came out and saw the paramedics were attending to the woman driver. At first I thought she had just lost control of the car and crashed into a fence.'

During the course of the morning, bunches of flowers and a teddy bear and card were left at the scene.

Mrs Evans' family visited the floral tributes, but were too upset to talk.

Family liaison officers continue to 
support Mrs Evans's family and Detective Chief Inspector Jonathan 
Hutchinson of the major crime unit (MCU) is keen to trace anyone who may
 have information relating to this inquiry.

He
 said: 'This was a terribly distressing attack on a defenceless woman 
who had recently married and should have been enjoying life with her 
family.

'We are in the 
process of trying to piece together exactly what happened prior to the 
stabbing and although we have arrested a man in connection with this 
incident, this inquiry is not solved and we do want to hear from anyone 
else who can help with information about what happened.

Stabbed in daylight: Forensic officers were at the scene throughout the afternoon and evening

'You may have been walking past just before or after the incident, or saw something or someone that was unusual, as you drove or walked along Trent Road.

'You may have already dismissed this information as insignificant or thought that the arrest of a person made it less important to us.

'Please don't assume that someone else has told us, or that we already know. Please come forward if you were in the area so that we have the fullest picture possible to help us complete this inquiry.

Anyone with information relating to this investigation is urged to contact officers from the MCU in confidence on 101, or text information on 07786 200 011.

Alternatively independent crime-fighting charity Crimestoppers can be contacted anonymously on 0800 555 111.

A post-mortem examination is due to be carried out on Mrs Evans' body this afternoon.
