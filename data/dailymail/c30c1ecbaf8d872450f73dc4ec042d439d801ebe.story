A dog that mauled a one-year-old boy to death is finally set to be put down after animal-rights activists pleaded for it to be spared.

Jeremiah Eskew-Shahan had just celebrated his first birthday when Onion, a six-year-old mastiff-Rhodesian ridgeback mix, launched a lethal attack on the boy.

Jeremiah, from Henderson, Nevada died after the 120lbs dog clamped its massive jaws over his head and violently shook the child for less than 30 seconds.

Onion was set to be put down following
a Nevada ruling in May, but The Nevada Supreme Court is set to hear the
final arguments today.

The court, in Carson City, is expected
to follow the ruling by Nevada Judge Joanna Kishner and sign the final 
order to euthanize Onion.

Onion, owned by Jeremiah’s grandfather, shook Jeremiah as he bit down, breaking the boy's neck and mangling his face.

Onion's owners willingly turned him over to animal control officials in May following the April 27 attack.

‘For what he did to my son, he 
deserves to be punished,’ Jeremiah's father, Christopher Shahan, told the Las Vegas Review-Journal. ‘I’ve already accepted the fact that he’s 
dead.'

Jeremiah's grandmother, Elizabeth 
Keller, watched in horror as the dog bit her grandson in the head.

She 
sobbed as she told the Review-Journal that the public legal fight over 
Onion's fate is putting even more strain on the family.

'I don't care if they save the dog or not. We need to get past this,' she said.

The family had just helped Jeremiah celebrate his first birthday at their Nevada home.

The boy was learning how to walk, and tried to help himself up by grabbing on to Onion.

Onion latched on to Jeremiah’s face and neck and began shaking him back and forth.

‘I tried everything I could think of to do to try and get him off our baby,’ Ms Keller recalled to WXIX.

However, she was unable to pry Onion 
off of her grandson. Mr Shahan, rushed to help, saying that his son’s 
jaw was loose and half of his face was missing.

Jeremiah was rushed to St Rose Dominican Hospital, where he was pronounced dead.

According to the coroner’s report, he sustained blunt force injuries of the head and neck.

After the family handed the dog over 
to be put down, a judge put a temporary stop to euthanising the dog 
after a group called the Lexus Project filed a legal petition to keep 
the dog alive.

The organization had said it found a dog sanctuary near Denver where the animal could spend the rest of his life.

'There is nothing vicious about the 
attack,' Richard Rosenthal, the head of the group that is fighting to 
save Onion, told the newspaper.

'Killing the dog will not bring back the baby,' said the New York lawyer.

Animal control officers in Henderson said Onion was a ‘vicious’ dog and requires euthanasia.

‘The dog attacked and killed a child,’
animal control spokesman Keith Paul said,’ adding that it would be 
‘irresponsible’ to allow Onion to continue living.

The final ruling on Onions fate will come Wednesday afternoon.
