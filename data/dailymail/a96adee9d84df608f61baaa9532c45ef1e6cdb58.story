David de Gea believes playing behind Manchester United’s continually changing defence has helped improved him as a goalkeeper.

A series of injuries to key players has seen United’s back line alter almost game-by-game this season under Louis van Gaal.

Van Gaal’s squad been crippled with injuries this season and they finished the match against Crystal Palace on Saturday with midfielders Daley Blind and Michael Carrick at centre half.

De Gea believes playing behind United’s changing defence has helped improved him as a goalkeeper.

Midfielder Daley Blind (left) lined up at centre back against Palace due to United's ever-growing injury list 

vs Crystal Palace: De Gea, Valencia, McNair, Blind, Shaw

vs Manchester City: De Gea, Valencia, Smalling, Rojo, Shaw

vs Chelsea: De Gea, Rafael, Smalling, Rojo, Shaw

vs West Brom: De Gea, Rafael, Jones, Rojo, Shaw

vs Everton): De Gea, Rafael, McNair, Rojo, Shaw

vs West Ham United: De Gea, Rafael, McNair, Rojo, Shaw

vs Leicester City: De Gea, Rafael, Evans, Blackett, Rojo

Even 19-year-old reserve Paddy McNair, who started that match against Palace as the only natural central defender, had to come off because of injury. 

‘I have never known this in the past,’ said De Gea.

‘We’ve had so much bad luck and it’s made it difficult to maintain the high level of consistency and performance that we need.

‘As a keeper it’s important to form a good understanding with your back four and become familiar with each other’s positions on the pitch.

‘It’s difficult when the players aren’t there but you have to adapt and concentrate on your job.

‘The experience has definitely helped me improve.’ 

Other high-profile United defenders currently out include Jonny Evans and Phil Jones.

This chopping and changing at the back (out of necessity) has contributed to their worst start to a league season since 1986.
