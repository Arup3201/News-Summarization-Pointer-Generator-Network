Meeting the first grandchild is an important and moving occasion for any grandparent. But for Carole and Michael Middleton, it was more momentous than most.

For as this middle-class couple from Buckinghamshire gazed down at their own flesh and blood, they were looking into the scrunched up face of the future King of England.

Carole and Michael arrived at St Mary's hospital in Paddington just after 3pm today. And of course Carole, an attractive 
woman with a keen fashion sense, was sure to look perfectly polished for this high profile moment.

Perhaps giving a nod to the gender of the baby, Carole chose a belted silk tea dress in a muted blue shade by Irish designer Orla Kiely.

The dress was the Dancing Girl tea dress from the Orla Kiely 2012 spring/summer collection. It is no longer on sale at the store, but is likely to have cost around £160.

Carole paired the dress with, what else, nude pumps. Though while Kate favours the LK Bennett sledge, Carole wore the Russell & Bromley Chic Pump mid-heel court, £175.

The Middletons became the very first members of the family to meet the Duke and Duchess's new 
son, almost 23 hours after the infant was born.

Until then the new parents had spent time bonding together with their baby. 

‘He’s beautiful. They are both doing really well. We are so thrilled,’ Carole told the gathered Press outside the Lindo Wing after their hour and a quarter-long visit.

She said the new parents were doing ‘fabulously’ - but wouldn't be drawn over the issue of naming the baby. No suggestions from them, them? ‘Absolutely not!’ said Carole.

Carole and Michael arrived a short while after Kate's hairdresser, Amanda Cook Tucker, unofficially confirmed that the Duke and Duchess would be departing today by arriving at the back entrance of the Lindo Wing wheeling along her kit bag.

The Middletons paused only for the briefest of moments at the top of the steps at the front entrance of the Lindo Wing before disappearing inside, no doubt eager to meet the new arrival.

The boy, who is third in line to the throne, will be the first monarch of the 22nd century, and will succeed his father William, making him third in the line of Kings that will follow on from the Queen's lengthy reign.

Kate, William and the new baby are expected to make their own appearance on the steps of the Lindo Wing, just like Charles and Diana did before them, at around 6pm today.

A member of the Royal household 
arrived at the same time as the hairstylist, carrying an opaque dress 
bag that looked to be holding at least three garments, thought to be the
selection of dresses Kate will choose from to make her first appearance
as a mother.

Speculation raged over what the Duchess might wear - but the odds were on her choosing a blue dress by a British designer.

As for other visitors, Royal watchers initially said we were unlikely to see any of the major Royals arrive at the hospital, mainly owing to the increased security it would demand.

Early reports suggested police presence would have to be upped sixfold if the Queen were to attend St Mary's - and the Royals would likely deem there had already been enough disruption to the running of the hospital and the areas around it.

But over the past hour, onlookers 
outside St Mary's have reported an increase in police presence that 
could either herald the departure of Kate and William - or the arrival 
of Royal visitors. 

Charles and Camilla are thought to be the most likely to be the next to arrive.

On Royal duties elsewhere, Sophie Wessex said she feels 'ridiculously happy' about the birth.

'It is a wonderful event. I'm hoping in the next few days to catch up with them,' she said.

'I
have sent messages but haven't visited. Having had babies myself I know
you really want to close down the hatches and be with your immediate 
family for the first few days and weeks. 

'I never expected to feel quite this happy but I've had a big smile on my face every since the news broke. '

It was one of the first clues that the Duke and Duchess would be leaving the hospital with their little prince today: Kate's hair stylist arriving at the Lindo Wing.

Accompanied by her assistant - who was carrying a baby car seat and a dress bag - the royal hairstylist, who also does the hair of Prince William and Prince Harry - arrived at St Mary's Hospital in Paddington shortly before Kate's parents Carole and Michael Middleton.

Amanda Cook Tucker, 50, often styles Kate's hair at home and has been cutting William and Harry's hair for years.

Amanda Cook Tucker has been Kate's hairdresser since the couple visited the Far East on a Diamond Jubilee Visit in September last year.

The blonde stylist was credited with giving Kate heat-proof hair that defied the humid Asian weather.

Previously Kate was a long-term client of the Richard Ward celebrity salon in Chelsea.

A source told the Mail on Sunday's Katie Nicholl last year: 'Amanda is an expert at what Kate loves – full glossy blow dries that hold.'

Mrs Cook Tucker’s ex-husband Neville Tucker also has Royal connections.

His Knightsbridge salon held the Royal Warrant from 1980 to 1994 and he worked closely with the Queen’s longest-serving hairdresser, Charles Martyn.

The Prince of Wales paid the cost of Mrs Cook Tucker throughout the tour last autumn, believed to be £300 a day plus travel costs.

A spokesman for the Duchess at the time said: ‘The Duchess’s hairdresser on the tour is a private individual paid for privately.'

A far cry from the throne he will one day occupy, the seat retails online for as little as £80
