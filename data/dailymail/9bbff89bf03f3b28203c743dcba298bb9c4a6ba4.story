Once again, this was a Liverpool performance that lacked conviction. Once again, this was a Liverpool performance that made you wonder just what their defensive training entails at their Melwood training ground. Once again, this was a Liverpool performance that posed more questions than answers for their manager Brendan Rodgers.

At half-time, Liverpool had seemed well on their way to a third win in a row and although this particular showing remained lightyears away from the dynamic and eminently watchable performances of last season, it would have taken them only five points behind Manchester United and within touching distance of the top four.

Rodgers’ side, however, do not resemble a team capable of challenging for Champions League football, despite the best efforts of Arsenal and Manchester United to invite them back into the race.

Leicester City's Jeffrey Schlupp celebrates after scoring the goal to make it 2-2 against Liverpool at Anfield

Schlupp strikes the ball past Simon Mignolet on the hour mark to equalise for Leicester

It is a measure of Liverpool’s difficulties this season that a victory here - following successes over Burnley, Swansea City - would have represented their longest winning sequence in the Barclays Premier League this season. In truth, they were lucky to escape from this game with a point.

Leicester hit the post inside the opening exchanges when Simon Mignolet was caught cold and a Riyad Mahrez free-kick cannoned off the inside of the post. Liverpool failed to heed the warning. Further chances passed Leicester by before their hosts were granted the initiative by a referee decision that Gary Lineker described as the ‘worst ever’ on Twitter. Certainly, Wes Morgan did not help his cause by sliding in, arms outstretched and flailing like an octopus but it did strike his head and Leicester have justification to be aggrieved.

For a while, there were signs that Liverpool were discovering the zest and rhythm of happier days, particularly in the speed and skill of Raheem Sterling and Coutinho. 

They remain the two Liverpool players most eminently capable of raising this Liverpool team when they feel the need. It was this combination that combined so beautifully to slice open the first goal, as Coutinho received the ball on the half-turn, pirouetting into space and zipping a reverse ball into the run of Sterling.

After the second penalty, we wondered briefly whether Liveprool may steam into overdrive. There was one wonderful effort from Jordan Henderson who arrowed a volley inches past the juncture of post and bar, almost replicating the Paul Scholes effort at Bradford City all those years. 

In the second half, however, all that momentum dissipated. The vulnerabilities of the 3-5-2 system were exposed by a direct Leicester outfit. Gaps appeared between the defence and midfield, defenders backed off as Gerrard and Lucas were caught too high up the pitch. At 2-2, Liverpool were the side that appeared edgy, short on confidence and unable to seize the initiative.

There was a telling moment when Steven Gerrard had possession on the right flank and with those in front of him stood like statues, he gestured furiously for some movement. A familiar groan rang out from those fans around the Press box. They have seen this ordinary level of performance far too often this season.
