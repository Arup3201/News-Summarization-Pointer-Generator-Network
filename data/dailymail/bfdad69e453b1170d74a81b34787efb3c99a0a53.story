Jews in eastern Ukraine are so concerned over their safety after last week's alleged anti-Semitic incidents that they are seeking advice on repatriation to Israel, it was claimed today.

This follows fears over a leaflet distributed in the city of Donetsk which demanded that people over 16 of Jewish origin should register with the authorities, a sinister development that smacked of the Nazi-era.

It has since been branded a fake by the pro-Russian separatists it claims to represent, as well as one of the city's rabbis.

But some local Jews are also concerned about a Russian invasion, with tens of thousands of troops within striking distance of the Ukrainian frontier, said Alexander Ivanchenko, who runs Sohnut, an organisation assisting people to go and live in Israel.

The leaflet distributed in Donetsk, Ukraine, calling for all Jews over 16-years-old to register or face deportation, sparked concern among the area's 15,000-strong Jewish community. Now many are looking at fleeing Ukraine for Israel

Pamphlets circulating in Donetsk demanded
 'citizens of Jewish nationality' over the age of 16 pay $50 to register
 and be issued special passports 'marking the confession of faith'.

'We are talking about Jewish people returning home to Israel,' he said. 'It is hard to talk about numbers now but I see that there are more people who come for advice asking how to apply for repatriation.

'I cannot say for sure that they will make a decision to leave for Israel, but I do see a rise in the level of interest. People call the Israeli embassy in Kiev. They start gathering the documents.'

Recent anti-Semitic incidents, including the controversial leaflet in the name of the breakaway Donetsk People's Republic - which strongly denies any role in it - have led to some of the local 17,000 Donetsk Jewish population considering fleeing to Israel.

'Most essential is, of course, the safety issue,' he said, as well as the chronic economic demise of Ukraine.

'People fear that war will start. They realise that the mythical "Banderovtsi" (so-called Ukrainian nationalist supporters of Stepan Bandera, who Russians associate with fascism) are not a threat - but Russian troops are.

'Now you add to that the anti-Semitism which has become an issue for some people. It's hard to say how many people would apply to move to Israel because of anti-Semitism.

'We will see the statistics later, maybe in a month or two, but it is clear that such anti-Semitic provocations have not happened here since World War Two, and no matter who was behind the leaflets, the message itself and the fact that they appeared, do scare people.'

Meanwhile, a Holocaust survivor has urged Jews in Ukraine to flee the country.

Sam Pivnik, 86, who was 14 when his family were rounded up in Bedzin, western Poland, and sent to Auschwitz, says Ukraine is still a hotbed of anti-semitism.M

Mr Pivnik, who now lives in Golder Green, London, told the Daily Express: 'Jews have no place in Ukraine, because nothing has changed,and as long as Jews remain there, nothing will change.

'They had no business staying in that country after the atrocities of 1939-1945. Jews in the Ukraine should leave.'

Before the Second World War a little under one-third of Ukraine's urban population consisted of Jews. In 1941 there were an estimated 2,700,000 Jews in Ukraine.

Nearly a million were murdered by the Nazis, often with the complicity of Ukrainians, and they were persecuted under the Soviet regime. In 1959 just 840,446 remained and numbers have declined steadily since then, leaving 65,000 today.

Ivanchenko said some Jews in Donetsk were pro-Russian, others pro-Ukrainian, and there was 'no united position', but the flare-up of anti-Semitism was a concern.

'A month ago I saw small posters hanging in Pushkin Boulevard in the city centre with anti-Semitic content.

'The poster said that Zionists want to unite Ukraine with Europe, to break the country away from its Slavic brothers, how wrong this was, and there were quotes from the bible. It clearly had an anti Jewish message.

'I'm not sure who's doing it, including those posters that appeared last Tuesday, but I do not think that it is the representatives of the Donetsk republic.

'You have to be really crazy to make such statements and I personally think that it is a provocation, but the problem is that it is very easy to do such a thing.

'And it will destabilise the situation. You can play any political game here and use it in any context.

'And what worries me is not the leaflets because they are forgeries. It is 99.9 per cent that it is just provocation.

'Who can guarantee that it will not move further and someone will be killed, for example.

'We have a lot of people brought into the town now, some criminal elements who are here to destabilise the situation. Some have weapons.

'And if some side decides to play the Jewish card, it can just fly out of control. 'People in balaclavas can come into the synagogue beat someone up or rob them.

'We do have fears that it can actually happen and there are talks about it in the synagogue. I think it can also motivate people to think more about repatriation.'

US Secretary of State John Kerry branded the leaflet 'grotesque' while he was in Geneva as part of peace talks. But the handout may have been a fake aimed at stirring up trouble in the region

The Ukrainian prime minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk demanded that those responsible for the flyer - calling on Jews to register and pay a fee - are found.

He urged 'the Ukrainian military and security forces and Ukrainian Department of Homeland Security urgently to find these b******* and to bring them to justice', he said.

The incident happened as around 20 Jews were leaving the synagogue earlier this week. The three hooded men handing out the pamphlets were carrying a Russian flag and the symbol of the separatist Republic of Donetsk. The leader of the breakaway republic Denis Pushilin - whose name was on the flyer - strongly denied any role.

However, the flyer has been branded a fake by religious leaders, including the area's rabbi.

The flyer, described as 'grotesque' by US Secretary of State John Kerry, has now been classed by the leader of the city's Jewish community as a hoax, aimed at stirring up trouble.

Russia has a long and unfortunate history of the persecution of the Jewish people.

In the late 18th century, Catherine the Great created the Pale of Settlement, which dictated where in Imperial Russia Jews were allowed to reside, an area of about 20 per cent of then-European Russia which today is part of Poland, Lithuania, Belarus, Moldova and, notably, Ukraine.

Tsarist Russia also saw a wave of anti-Jewish  riots, known as pogroms, which took off with the violent persecution in Odessa in 1821, now the third largest city in Ukraine, which had one of the highest percentages of Jewish population in the Pale of Settlement.

Decades of pogroms followed, with a peak between 1881 to 1884 when more than 200 anti-Jewish events occurred in the Russian Empire, notably in Kiev, Warsaw and Odessa.

The trigger was the assassination of Russia's Tsar Alexandr II, for which many blamed 'The Jews'.

Between 1903 and 1906 thousands of Jews were killed in pogroms, including the 1905 pogrom of Odessa which saw up to 2,500 Jewish men, women and children killed, according to historic reports.

The pogroms,  harsh conditions and wide-spread poverty in the Pale of Settlement saw some two million Jews emigrate, mainly to the U.S. in the late 1800s and early 1900s.

During the Soviet era, the Soviet Union and countries within its sphere of influence were accused of persecuting Jews.

Josef Stalin was said by numerous sources to despise Jews and under Brezhnev, Jews faced discrimination.

'Perhaps you got Ukraine confused with Russia, where Jewish organizations have noticed growth in anti-Semitic tendencies last year.'
