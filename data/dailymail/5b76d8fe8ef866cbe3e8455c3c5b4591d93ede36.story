A spectacular mansion in rural Scotland has gone on the market for £1.1million - the same price as an ordinary one-bedroom flat in central London.

Stracathro Mansion House, which has more than 80 rooms, is being sold by artist Francis Convery, who has been using it as a personal gallery since 2003.

However, he has now decided that the Grade I-listed house - near the city of Brechin in Angus - is too big for him, as he does not take advantage of its full 28,000 sq/ft and is frequently embarrassed when visitors comment on the size of his home.

For sale: Stracathro Mansion House is currently on the market for £1.1million - even though it has more than 80 rooms

Luxurious: But the property only costs as much as a one-bedroom flat in central London

After a planned sale fell through, the property has returned to the market with a £1.1million asking price - or £1.68million including a coach house and row of cottages on the eight-acre grounds.

The Palladian-style mansion is dominated by magnificent Corinthian columns, while inside the walls are dominated by the artworks of its current owner.

'In total there are 87 spaces in the house and you can go for a walk inside,' Mr Convery said. 'People are dumbstruck when they go inside. They don't know what to say. It can be a bit embarrassing.

'The proportions are really energising and I have really enjoyed living here but it is time for a change. The basement and top floor are left on their own at the moment but the middle two floors are used.

'I think the mansion has got great commercial potential. There is room for a bar and spa and it would be excellent for weddings and conferences. People are attracted to the period feel.'

Ornate: The home was built in the early 19th century for a Scottish family which had made its fortune in Jamaica

The £1.1million price tag is the same as a 420sq/ft flat in Mayfair which was recently advertised on the market.

That tiny home has just one bedroom, one reception room, a tiny kitchen and a shower room - but central London homes now attract such demand that it was sold for seven figures.

Stracathro House was built between 1824 and 1827 for the Cruikshank family, who had made their fortune in Jamaica during the heyday of the British Empire.

After the home went into decline in the 20th century, it was acquired by the Government and turned into a military hospital during the Second World War.

View: The reception rooms of the home overlook its eight acres of grounds in a beautiful area of Scotland

Garden: There is a pond in the grounds which in itself is larger than many people's homes

The house spent several decades providing flats for doctors and nurses, then in 2003 Mr Convery bought and refurbished the property.

The home has a number of spectacular features, including marble floors and fireplaces, enormous French doors, high ceilings and ornate carvings.

Each of the three principal reception rooms flow along the northerly aspect and are connected by magnificent double doors.

The rooms are highly decorated and have floor-to-ceiling sash and case windows overlooking the terrace.

Home: Francis Convery has been living in the house for a decade but has now decided that it is too big for him

Gallery: Mr Convery partly used the mansion as a venue to display his artworks

Julia Willett, from estate agent Strutt & Parker, said: 'Stracathro House is one of the most beautiful properties we have ever marketed in this office.

'It is grand and elegant and everywhere you look there is something beautiful.

'It is a shame that the earlier sale has fallen through but on the other hand this is a great opportunity for someone else to buy this great house.'

While £1.1million may be much more than most people can afford for a home, it will go a lot further in rural Scotland than elsewhere in Britain.

In the heart of central London, that amount will only buy you a one-bedroom Mayfair flat with a tiny kitchen and shower room.

The property market in super-prime areas like Mayfair, Kensington and Knightsbridge has been soaring faster than anywhere else in the country thanks to an influx of wealthy new buyers from Russia and the Middle East.

Modest: This one-bedroom flat in central London is on the market for £1.1million

In the up-and-coming east of the capital, £1.1million can get you a four-bedroom terraced house in Hackney, an early 20th-century home spread over three storeys.

One of the reasons for the high price tag is that the home comes with a garden - but it is a small patch of lawn not comparable to the eight-acre estate which surrounds Stracathro Mansion House.

A more spacious family home can be found in the suburbs, where a four-bedroom semi-detached house in Ealing is currently on the market for £1.1million.

This property boasts four bathrooms, an office and a large open-plan living space, but is comparatively cheaper because of its distance from central London.

Flat: A penthouse in Sandbanks, Dorset costs the same as the gigantic house in Scotland

Anyone interested in joining David Cameron's 'Chipping Norton set' might take a look at a five-bedroom farmhouse in Oxfordshire, expected to fetch upwards of £1million.

The home shares the rural charms of Stracathro, but is rather more modest in scale with just a small front garden and a 'delapidated pigsty' around the back of the house. 

And for the super-rich in need of a holiday home, £1.1million is the price of a two-bedroom flat in Sandbanks, the Dorset resort which has become the country's most exclusive seaside retreat. 

The penthouse apartment owes its asking price to a sun terrace overlooking Poole Harbour, as well as Poole's reputation as a favourite hang-out for the rich and famous.
