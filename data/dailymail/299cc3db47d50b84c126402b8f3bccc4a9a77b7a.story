Street artist Banksy is known for being elusive, but he surprised even his most ardent fans by secretly selling his authentic artworks near Central Park for just $60 each on Saturday.

On his 13th day in New York City, the UK-based artist displayed dozens of original, signed canvases at a pop-up stall attended by an unknown man.

The graffiti painter is in the middle of a month-long residency in New York, producing one piece of street art per day until October 31.

Sneaky: A stall selling original, signed Banksy art popped up near New York's Central Park on Saturday, but passersby had no idea the works were authentic

Surprising: For his 13th day in New York, Banksy pulled a fantastic prank by setting up an unannounced art stall with dozens of 100% original signed canvases for $60 each

The artwork stand opened about midday with an inventory value estimated in the hundreds of thousands of dollars. Each small to medium-sized canvas is worth at least $30,000.

Yet over seven hours, just three people bought eight canvases - a total haul of $420.

The first sale was at 3.30pm to a woman who bought two canvases for her children - and she managed to wrangle a 50 per cent discount.

Half an hour later, a New Zealand woman purchased some art. Video shows the vendor embracing her warmly and kissing her cheek.

Bemused: The stand was manned by an unknown man who seemed completely uninterested in what he was doing

First customer: The store made its first sale at 3.30pm on Saturday. A woman bought two canvases for her children but negotiated a 50 per cent discount

Sale no. 2: At 4pm, a woman from New Zealand bought two artworks, to the delight of the merchant

At 5.30pm, a Chicago man rocked up seeking art for his new house: 'I just need something for the walls.' He left with four original Banksys.

The disinterested-looking vendor shut up shop at 6.30pm.

But don't expect a repeat performance. Banksy's website points out that the pop-up stand was a one-off: 'The stall will not be there again today.'

Each day during his Better Out Than In residency, Banksy has posted a snapshot of his latest project and includes the location for fans to check out. The work varies from simple stencils to large, detailed murals.

Final sale: The last sale of the day was at 6.30pm when a Chicago man rocked up looking for art to decorate his new house. Judging by the big man hug, it must have been an emotional sale

Dismal: The merchant shut up shop at 6.30pm, taking in just $420 after more than six hours on the job
