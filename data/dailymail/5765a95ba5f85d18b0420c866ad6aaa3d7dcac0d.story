Didier Drogba has revealed he will continue his playing career next season.

The Ivorian made a shock return to Chelsea last summer after leaving the club in 2012, signing a 12 month deal.

But the Blues legend's future remains unclear with the club still to offer him a new contract.

However, Drogba, 37, insists he has no intention to retire at the end of the season - whether he is at Chelsea or not.

'I have made a decision, it's not my last season,' said Drogba.

The veteran striker has been forced to settle for a bit-part role at Stamford Bridge this season after the summer arrivals of Diego Costa and Loic Remy.

And he admits he finds sitting on the bench frustrating, saying: 'It's difficult when you don't play and then have to go into these kind of games. But I try to give my best.

'I tried to give the best of my physical capacity against QPR, so if the manager needs me I'm ready.'

Despite his lack of action, Drogba looks certain to pick up his fourth Premier League title this season.

And the forward, who started Sunday's win at QPR, added: 'We are only looking forward. We just wanted to win at QPR to get closer to the title.

'We still have those games against Manchester United and Arsenal to play. But we try to only think about our game.

'We are top of the league. They are maybe thinking about us and hoping we make a bad result. But we are more positive that we want to win.

'You want to feel that it's comfortable at the top, but when you look at the game against QPR, you know the gap can be closed easily within a game or two.

'So you have to stay focussed and give everything like we did.'
