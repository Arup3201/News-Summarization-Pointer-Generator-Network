Chelsea attacking midfielder Willian has shown he is just as capable of showing off his football skills in a swimming pool as he is on the Stamford Bridge pitch.

The Brazil international has pulled off a stunning piece of trickery by flicking the ball over his head and into a basketball net while standing in a swimming pool.

Willian, who has scored three goals for Jose Mourinho's side so far this season, turns around to watch his shot land in the net.

The 26-year-old uploaded the video on to his official Instagram account with the caption 'LeBron Willian James!!! Hahahaha,' in reference to NBA superstar LeBron James.

Former Anzhi playmaker Willian, who picked up a minor injury knock in Chelsea's 1-1 draw against Manchester City on Saturday afternoon, bursts into laughter after executing the trick shot with flying colours.

Mourinho will be hoping Willian can hit the back of a different kind of net when Premier League leaders Chelsea take on Aston Villa at the weekend.
