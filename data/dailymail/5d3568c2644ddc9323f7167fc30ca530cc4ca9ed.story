A stalker obsessed with a former beauty queen was jailed for four months today after he ‘tagged’ a Facebook photograph of her with the word 'slut'.

In July last year Anthony Mantova was sentenced to 18 weeks in prison after pleading guilty to harassing 21-year-old singer Chloe Hopkins.

Magistrates imposed an indefinite restraining order banning Mantova, who had the Welsh beauty queen’s name tattooed on his chest, from contacting her or creating any communication about her.

The court heard that Mantova, who suffers from multiple schlerosis, fell out with Miss Hopkins and sent her numerous text messages and emails, made sexually motivated Facebook comments and followed her.

In November he was jailed for another 28 days after admitting breaching the restraining order.

But prosecutor Richard Edwards told Caernarfon crown court that in March her boyfriend received a Facebook request from Mantova asking to ‘tag’ a photograph and he accidentally allowed this.

Mantova wrote ‘slut’ across Miss Hopkins’ forehead.

Frances
Hertzog, defending, said that when 35-year-old Mantova, of Meliden, 
Prestatyn, Wales, was last imprisoned he left jail in a wheelchair.

‘His grave concern is incarceration is going to have a detrimental impact on his health,’ she said.

Judge Peter Heywood told Mantova : ‘I have a victim impact statement that indicates the significant effect your conduct in harassing Miss Hopkins has had.

‘It has affected her health significantly. She’s had to undergo counselling and lost time at work.’

He added: ‘Your actions have had a devastating effect on her.’

He admitted breaching the restraining order again.

The original case heard that while she was Miss Prestatyn in 2010 Mantova suggested her tiara and sash ‘would look good on his bedroom floor’.

Mantova had four names tattooed on his chest of the victim and her friends, sent unwanted birthday, Valentine’s and Christmas cards, and placed a lewd comment on the Miss Prestatyn website.

He even had a picture of Miss Hopkins printed on a T shirt which he wore in public.
