With her showstopping hourglass physique and savvy style, Michelle Keegan is the envy of women worldwide.

Fashion brand Lipsy wanted to tap into the Michelle magic and called on Weatherfield's most stylish export to collaborate on a collection.

After months of hard work, the range is finally here - all modelled by the former Coronation Street star herself, of course.

Want her wardrobe? Now you can have it thanks to Michelle's new range for Lipsy, which is full of all the things she loves to wear herself

Michelle couldn't be prouder of the 30-piece Autumn 2014 
collection, which is available online at Lipsy.co.uk and across all UK 
Lipsy stores today.

Speaking at the launch of her range last night, the 26-year-old told MailOnline: 'Coming in here and seeing the clothes and my name up in lights is amazing, it's made it really real now and I keep having to pinch myself.

'I have been working on it for so long and created collages of my favourite red carpet looks and colours and shapes that I love so it's full of things I wear myself. I would describe it as quite minimalistic, classic and tailored with a girly edge.

'It's my dream come true and I hope to design for many years to come.'

The chic range of figure-hugging dresses, cosy coats and on-trend totes was based around Michelle's own fashion choices and outfits she's worn in the past. 

Too much choice: The 30-piece range is full of glamorous gowns, cute playsuits and winter coats and lands in stores and online today, dress, left, £60 and, right, sleeveless dress, £65

Love her look: Michelle told MailOnline that she loves all the jumpsuits, which are both sexy and smart, jumpsuit, £75

Flattering designs: The range has been created with women's varying shapes in mind and is designed to flatter the female form, dress, £65

Wide range: Michelle couldn't be prouder of the 30-piece Autumn 2014 collection, which is available online, skirt, £40

Party spirit: A lot of Michelle's key designs are perfect for a night out on the town with the girls, playsuit, £55

Michelle added: 'I have spent a lot of time over
 the last few months working closely with the Lipsy design team to make 
sure that each piece in my collection is something I am excited about 
wearing.

'My collection is classic, unfussy and feminine in style, and I can’t wait for it to hit the high street and see everyone wearing it.'

Michelle was sure to show off some of her key designs at last night's launch. 

Her hard work paid off! Michelle said she's spent a lot of time over the last few months working closely with the Lipsy design team to make sure that each piece is perfect, dress, £50

Classy styles: Michelle says that she worked hard to ensure that each piece in the range is something that she would love to wear herself, dress, £75

The
 actress arrived in a feminine pale pink skirt, black cami and leather 
jacket, before changing into a masculine yet sexy looking black suit.

At
 the Rosewood Hotel in Central London, Keegan was joined by her fiancé 
Mark Wright, who turned up an hour later than his wife-to-be to no doubt
 to let her enjoy being the centre of attention as she launched her 
capsule collection.

Michelle’s
 soon to be sister-in-law and bridesmaid Jessica Wright was also in 
attendance wearing a white and nude dress with a black waistline and 
matching handbag.
