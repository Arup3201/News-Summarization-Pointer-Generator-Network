The Met Office has issued an amber warning of rain for England and east Wales for throughout today.

It said: 'Several areas of heavy, thundery showers will develop over England and Wales from Friday night before moving northwards during Saturday.

'Not everywhere within the warning area will see thunderstorms, and indeed some spells of warm sunshine are expected at times, but where thunderstorms do form, some torrential downpours are likely with frequent lightning, large hail and locally strong gusts.

'Significant flooding is possible where these do occur from surface water as well as from small, fast-responding watercourses. The public should be prepared for the risk of disruption from any of these elements.'

The Environment Agency warned 30mm of rain could fall in an hour in some areas during the torrential downpours, increasing the risk of localised and flash flooding.

Environment Minister Dan Rogerson said the EA was working closely with local authorities to prepare for any localised flooding.

He said: 'Our priority is public safety. I urge people to be prepared and act on the advice from the Environment Agency and local emergency services.'

While John Curtin, director of incident management at the Environment Agency, added: 'Intense heavy rainfall this weekend brings a surface water flood risk for England throughout the weekend.

'Flooding can happen very quickly and the public are urged to keep checking local weather forecasts and the Environment Agency website for information on a regular basis.

'We will continue to monitor the situation closely and support local authorities, who will respond to any reports of surface water flooding. We will also continue to monitor river levels closely and issue warnings where flooding is likely.'

It comes after storms hit part of the country on Thursday night.
