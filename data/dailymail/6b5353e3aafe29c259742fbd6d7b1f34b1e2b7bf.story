A foster mother has escaped jail despite scolding a two-year-old boy with boiling water that left third-degree burns.

Lan Huyhl Le, 29, was found guilty of second-degree cruelty after the child in her care sustained burns that scaled six inches up his legs, as well as bruising to his ears, face and arm.

The boy required skin grafts for the severe blisters, which were uniform and without splash marks, investigators said.

But her sentencing today at Calcasieu Judicial Center in Lake Charles, Louisiana, sparked outrage in the court room as Judge Ron Ware handed Le a five-year suspended prison term and three years' supervised probation.

Just six months ago, Ware found Le guilty of child cruelty and told the jury her account of the incident did not match the forensic evidence. 

Le, who was not burned in the incident, claimed the child climbed into the tub himself and she later rushed in to pull the plug.

However,  Ware said in May that she would have been scolded if that were the case.

The American Press reports  Le wept when Ware said he was not going to sentence her to serve time. 

He told the court she still had 'plenty of good' to give and said he felt she acted negligently.

Controversial: The same judge that found Le guilty of cruelty said she 'still has plenty of good' to give

After the sentencing, Ware hugged Le, who now lives in Florida, and her family in the hallway.

Ware found Le guilty of second-degree cruelty to a juvenile after a six-day trial in May. 

Le had requested he hear the case instead of a jury. 

Blasting the verdict, District Attorney John DeRosier told KPLCtv: 'A two year old child was scalded in this case.

'I think it is inappropriate for the defendant to walk away from this they way that she has. However, that is not for me to decide.' 

Defense attorney Cliff Newman said Le is a 'good lady.'

War of words: The DA John DeRosier (left) felt it was an inappropriate sentence but her attorney described Le as a 'good lady' who took in children when nobody else wanted them. She has received a suspended sentence

'When nobody wanted those children, Lan Le wanted them and raised them,' he said, asking Ware for a suspended sentence.

Le, who did not testify during her trial, said the incident was an 'accident.'

'I loved all my foster kids,' she told Ware. 

'What happened was everybody's worst nightmare and something I have to live with every day of my life.'

It hurt her that she could not be there for the boy during his recovery, she said. 'Not a day goes by that I don't think about [him],' she said.
