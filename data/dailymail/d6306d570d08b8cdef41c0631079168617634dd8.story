Furious: Angela Godwin, 34, with her daughter who was illegally tattooed aged 14 by a man using a kit he bought online

An unlicensed tattooist who illegally branded a 14-year-old girl has been let off with only a £40 fine.

Ross Richardson used a kit he had bought online to mark the stomach of the teenager, who was four years below the legal minimum age of 18.

The schoolgirl paid him £20 for the tattoo – designed to commemorate her late grandfather – which was done at his flat on a ‘dirty mattress on the floor’.

Richardson, 23, was later fined £40 after he pleaded guilty to tattooing a minor.

Yesterday the girl’s mother Angela Godwin, 34, said: ‘I think it is disgusting he has got away with just a £40 fine.

‘It’s pathetic. My daughter was vulnerable and she was put in a compromising position by this man.’

The mother-of-three, who works as a midwife, said: ‘I’m so angry and so upset with what has happened and the tiny amount of punishment he received.

‘It was an unforgivable act of selfish greed. I despise him.’

Miss Godwin, who did not want to reveal her daughter’s name, said the teenager – now 15 – had been ‘scared to death’ after realising she could have become ill from unsterilised tattoo equipment.

Speaking at their family home in Gloucester, she said: ‘She had blood tests and they are clear but it has petrified her.

‘She hates it and regrets it entirely. She is desperate to have it removed and is really upset she has this horrible mark on her.’

Angry: Miss Godwin, left, was horrified when she saw the design on her daughter. Ross Richardson, right, was fined just £40 for the offence at Stroud Magistrates' Court on Monday

She added: ‘She can’t have it removed until she is 18 and even then it could cost £2,000 so I see this as her punishment.’

The design shows a set of rosary beads with the letter J underneath, for her grandfather John who died in March.

Miss Godwin first spotted the tattoo, inked in June, while her daughter was playing with her younger sister, and demanded an explanation before calling the police.

She said: ‘He never asked her age [or] gave her any information on safety and just did not seem  to care.

‘He asked her who knows about it and she lied and said her dad, to which he apparently replied “That’s good enough for me”.

'At the age of 14 I do not see how it can be her fault. She didn’t have the capacity to make her own decisions. He had a responsibility to say no to her.'

Richardson was fined £40 and ordered to pay a £20 victim surcharge as well as £20 costs at Stroud Magistrates’ Court in Gloucestershire on Monday.

Prosecuting, Teresa Perry said: 'No questions were asked of age or consent. Her mother was aghast.' She said he admitted not asking the girl’s age but assumed she was 18.

Richardson refused to comment at his Gloucester flat yesterday.
