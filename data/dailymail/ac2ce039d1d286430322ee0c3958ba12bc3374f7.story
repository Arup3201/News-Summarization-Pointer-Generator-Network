Tennis great Martina Navratilova today stole the show at the US Open as she proposed to her girlfriend on the big screen of Arthur Ashe Stadium between the  men's semifinals. 

After Kei Nishikori's stunning win over world number one Novak Djokovic in the semi-finals, Navratilova appeared on the big screen on Arthur Ashe Stadium to pop the question.

Navratilova, 57, said: 'I have been waiting for the right time to ask Julia to marry me. I thought this was the right place and the right time to pop the question and thankfully I got a 'yes'.'

Proposal: Martina Navratilova proposed to her partner Julia Lemigova at the US Open

The crowd at the Arthur Ashe stadium roared as they watched the proposal on the jumbotron as Navratalova presented her partner with a diamond ring.  

The couple have been together for six years and live in Miami with Russian Lemigova's two daughters. Lemigova now runs a skin care company.

The 42-year-old businesswoman said: 'We are very happy together and Martina has made our family complete.'

Miss Lemigova is a mother of two young daughters from a previous marriage for which the couple have decided to share parenting duties.

When the tennis ace announced her retirement back in 1994 at the age of 37, helicopter skiing and hanging out at her 100-acre hotspot in Colorado were the top priorities.

Now, she splits her time between Aspen and Miami. 

Martina has had difficult relationships with ex-girlfriends in the past, including Toni Layton and former beauty queen Judy Nelson, but it seems the sportswoman has finally met her match.

Lemigova was also at the tennis star's side when she successfully fought off breast cancer in 2010.
