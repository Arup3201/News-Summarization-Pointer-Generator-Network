Rumours of Harrison Smith following Earl Thomas as safety-turned punt returner are greatly exaggerated.

But anyone who witnessed his 81-yard interception touchdown against the St Louis Rams cannot fail to be impressed.

'Those days left me in high school, I guess,' Smith says after his dart into the end zone put the gloss on the Minnesota Vikings' crushing 34-6 win.

As starts go, it was impressive. But the level-headed 25-year-old is rightly refusing to get carried away.

'It’s a confidence-builder. It’s a great place to start and we did a lot of good things but there’s still a lot to improve on and a lot to correct so we just need to focus on getting those things done and getting better.

'For starters getting the yards down in the passing game. Especially being a defensive back. I think we gave up like 250/260 yards which is too much for us. But getting turnovers was big, getting sacks was big and keeping points down is the overall goal.'

Smith missed half of last season with turf toe - a major factor in the Vikings conceding an average of over 30 points a game. And as he enters his third NFL season, he agrees he is one of the leaders of Mike Zimmer's aggressive, confusing new defensive scheme.

'I would say my approach to the game and my approach to everyday showing up is being a guy that is accountable. Of being a guy that coaches can rely on.

'Watching other guys has helped me. Chad Greenway is a guy on the team who’s an obvious leader on the defense, he’s a guy I’ve learned a ton from and continue to learn from. So I'm still trying to grow with that role and get better at it.'

Zimmer and general manager Rick Spielman began their overhaul of the defense in March, with the free agency additions of run-stuffing defensive tackle Linval Joseph from the New York Giants and cornerback Captain Munnerlyn from the Carolina Panthers.

'Both huge additions,' Smith says. 'Linval, not only is he a great run-stopper - he kind of clogs up that middle - he’s a real athletic guy. Gets a lot of pressure on the quarterback and that showed up on Sunday.

'Captain, not only can he play corner but he comes into that nickel spot. He’s an aggressive player. Physical. Makes plays on the ball, tackles really well. So when he’s out there he’s going to make his presence known. I’m just happy to have him on our side.'

Smith's score was the third of his career from 25 games - trailing Munnerlyn's five from 78.

'He’s got a little bit of a lead on me. We were joking about that after the game, so I’m trying to catch him,' he laughs.

After joining the Vikings from Notre Dame in the 2012 draft, he knows the path from the first round (selected 29th) to starter well. He praised lockermate Anthony Barr, the giant linebacker who came from UCLA as the ninth pick in May's draft.

'Obviously Anthony Barr is a guy who you know, he’s a ballplayer. That was obvious as soon as he stepped onto the field. And him being in our defense too, you really don’t think of him as a rookie.

'He’s going to get his job done, he’s going to make plays not a lot of people can make and it’s going to be exciting to see what he really becomes after he gets a few games under his belt because he’s already doing things that not a lot of people can do.'

'He gets pressure on the quarterback, makes tackles in space, great in the coverage game and put some pretty good hits on the quarterback on Sunday, so it’s nice having him as an addition.'

In Smith's first season, a Vikings team packed with defensive stalwarts such as Kevin Williams, Jared Allen and Antoine Winfield won their final four regular season games to reach the play-offs. Smith remembers his time with the now-retired Winfield fondly.

'I learned how to be a pro really from him. Just sitting in a room with him, just seeing how he shows up does his job. Great guy on and off the field and somebody to really look up to.'

A keen student of the game, Zimmer has spoken in glowing terms of the disruptive Smith's willingness to learn. 

Before his injury last October, he looked set for the Pro Bowl, and his conscientious approach to the game is to be admired. 

'You want to improve on things that you have control over,' he says. There’s times when you can do extra. Times when you need to watch extra film. Times when you need to spend extra time getting your body right, working out, so I think part of learning to be a pro and to be efficient is knowing when to work on those things. Because you can’t just work yourself into the ground in all areas: you’re not going to last very long - it’s a long season. So you need to know what to improve on. And get it done and that’s something I’ve tried to learn more and more every season.'

'There’s guys I have a ton of respect for and like watching on film. [Troy] Polamalu, obviously. Brian Dawkins. I got to watch [Eric] Weddle last night. Guys all over making plays. Ed Reed was a guy who made unbelievable things happen. So you try and learn stuff from guys watching films every week. You can pick up some things that a guy will do here and there and just try and add things to your game.'

'Growing up I remember one of the first guys I was excited to see play the position was Steve Atwater. It was toward the end of his career at Denver. He was a guy, I remember watching the Broncos against the Packers and he hit one of the Packers receivers and one of the Broncos corners on the same play. He was a guy that was fun to watch when I was really young.'

Next up, the Vikings welcome the might of the Patriots to the TCF Bank Stadium. Stinging from a 20-33 defeat against Miami Dolphins, Smith knows facing the learned mind of Bill Belichick and a modern great in the shape of Tom Brady will be tough. But that's why he plays the game.

'Obviously, he’s one of the best to play that position. I’m excited to go against a guy of his calibre, which there are not many of. Just even to play against them it’s kind of what we look forward to; playing against the best. We’re going to get ready to play and we’ll see where the chips fall after Sunday.'

And as well as being a major part of a new look team, the hard-hitting Smith also has a new nickname. Christened 'Harry the Hitman' by ebullient play-by-play caller Paul Allen, it is a moniker he is embracing.

'I like it. He asked me if it was OK to call me it. And I gave him the go-ahead. PA does a great job. And it’s fun to hear him get excited on the play-by-plays.'

And if the Vikings go to 2-0 on Sunday, both Smith and Allen will have much to be excited about.
