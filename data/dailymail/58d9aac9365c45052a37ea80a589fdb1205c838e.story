Warren Gatland has warned George North that he must make more of an impact at club and international level if he wants to keep his place in the Wales starting XV.

The Kiwi coach yesterday fuelled speculation that North, 22, will be named on the bench for the RBS Six Nations opener against England, suggesting that Scarlets winger Liam Williams could be handed the starting jersey

North burst on to the international scene as a teenager and has since started 47 out of his 48 Tests. However, Gatland has hinted he could stick to the winning formula that beat South Africa in November, when North was sidelined with concussion.

Wales boss Warren Gatland has said he wants to see more of Northampton's George North on the ball

‘Northampton have the same issues with George, having spoken to [backs coach] Alex King about touching the ball more,’ said Gatland. ‘We want to see more touches and have the ball in his hands. When he does that, he is dangerous and makes some metres for us.

‘If you are a player who has won against South Africa and started the game, then it’s sometimes difficult for that player to be dropped. We won’t sit down as a coaching team until Monday or Tuesday and start talking about a team. We will see how players front up. It’s a nice position for us to be in and we have options.’

North has been a key component in Wales’s physical style of play – commonly referred to as ‘Warrenball’ – while Williams is a much less powerful athlete. Collisions are getting bigger in the Test arena and Gatland admitted that his side will direct their heavy ball-carriers, especially inside-centre Jamie Roberts, towards fly-half George Ford, who is one of England’s smallest players.

‘People target the 10 channel in modern international rugby,’ said Gatland. ‘Outside-halves are physically one of the smallest players on the field. We are no different to anyone else and it’s part of the game now.

‘Jamie Roberts was outstanding on the weekend against Northampton. One of the positives about our players in France is they have not played too much rugby, so they are pretty fresh and looking forward to the Six Nations.’

Gatland is ‘hopeful’ that tight-head prop Samson Lee will recover from a neck injury in time for the opening Test at the Millennium Stadium. The 22-year-old has emerged as one of the world’s best young scrummagers, with his fitness becoming increasingly important following the shock retirement of veteran Adam Jones.

‘I was surprised at the timing [of Jones’s announcement],’ said Gatland. ‘I thought he might have waited until the end of the season, because the door wasn’t closed for him. He has made the decision and his contribution to Welsh rugby has been immense.

‘What he has achieved in our game is tremendous and there was a time where he was the first name on the team sheet. He has won three Grand Slams, another Six Nations Championship and a Lions tour.’

Plying his trade in France, the Racing Metro 92 player will be fresh heading into the Six Nations
