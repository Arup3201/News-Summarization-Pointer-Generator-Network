Rikki Lea Mynott was jailed for four months after being convicted of two assaults, being drunk and disorderly and breaches of previous court orders

A feckless father has been banned from every single pub and club along an entire 13 mile stretch of coastland after going on a six year drinking binge funded by state handouts.

Jobless Rikki-Lea Mynott, 25, terrorised police, bar staff, paramedics and the public after blowing his benefit money on marathon drinking sessions in Blackpool and other towns and villages bordering the Lancashire seaside resort.

In the latest incident, Mynott got drunk again and was said to have behaved like a 'wild animal' biting a nightclub doorman before kicking a policewoman called to the scene to restrain him.

In previous incidents he abused paramedics trying to help him after he was found collapsed and injured in a drunken stupor - and in another stormed round a taxi rank shouting: 'I’m going to kill someone.'

Since November 2007 Mynot thas been a familiar figure at Blackpool magistrates court for his booze binges where he was given fines or supervision orders.

He claimed to be getting treatment for his heavy drinking and vowed to go tee-total.

But in a message posted on his Facebook page only last week he admitted: 'Hate remembering what I said - drunk last night.' and added: 'F***in (sic) defo lost my bank card.'

Today Lancashire Police said Mynott, who has a young daughter, had been issued with a year long Drinking Banning Order barring him from all pubs and clubs in at at least 16 different towns and villages across the Fylde Coast.

The order was imposed as he was jailed for four months after being convicted of two assaults, being drunk and disorderly and breaches of previous court orders.

It means he is barred from buying, drinking or possessing alcohol in public and from entering certain establishments that serve alcohol.

The DBO will come into force once he is freed from jail. If he is caught inside a pub or club he faces a maximum fine of £2,500.

Blackpool JP Mark Cowburn told him: 'We feel we have a duty to protect the people of Blackpool Fylde and Wyre. These offences you have committed and previous offences, show you are a dangerous individual.'

Afterwards a pub boss in the area said: 'This man has been a total menace to bars and clubs up and down the coast.

'The problem is he gets barred from one premisis and then he simply goes to another - not even worrying about travelling from town to town.

‘What amazes us is how is able to aford his drinking. He’s supposed to be unemployed yet it seems he can gallivant around funding his life of drinking with his welfare handouts. It’s a disgrace.'

Mynott was initially before the court in November 2007 for disorderly behaviour after he insisted on shouting and swearing in the street - despite pleas from officer for him to go home.

A woman at a taxi rank was so concerned about Mynott’s behaviour she asked a police officer to stay with her until her cab arrived as he yelled: 'I’m going to kill someone.'

At the time Mynott claimed he was angry because his girlfriend’s former boyfriend had allegedly beaten her up and insisted he was trying to stop drinking.

But in June 2009 he was back in court after being seen staggering along the street with a pint glass full of beer.

Although an officer grabbed the glass and poured the alcohol away, Mynott was allowed entry into a nightclub.

At drinking up time, the same officer who had been keeping watch on Mynott told him to get rid of it, only for Mynott to start flailing his arms and push the officer.

The following November Mynott was back in court again after he was drunkenly throwing punches in the air and threatened a group of people saying he was going 'to kick their heads in'.

He promised again he was trying to sort his life out and had been on an alcohol rehabilitation course and said on the night of the offence he had a row with someone who owed him money.

But in July this year he abused paramedics who were called to a street where he lay drunk and injured.

The medics and police officers were trying to help him into the ambulance but he was so abusive he was arrested.

Mynott claimed he had been to a party then fell over in the street banging his head and losing consciousness.

But later police answering a report of men and women fighting on the beach near Central Pier found Mynott drunk again with cuts on his face.

The latest incident occurred in the early hours of September 29 when police were called to the Loft nightclub in Lytham St Annes after Mynott was seen 'bouncing' around on the dance floor with a wine bottle in his hand.

A doorman tried to eject him but he was bitten on the forearm. Police arrived and had to grapple with Mynott who was handcuffed and put in leg restraints and in the melee kicked a woman officer twice in the leg.

In a separate incident, while on bail, Mynott drunkenly threw himself on the bonnet of a police car.

In mitigation Mynott said he had problems with the police and people in authority after drinking. He was vowing to get more treatment for his alcohol problems.

After the case Sgt Niamh O’Donoghue, of Blackpool Police’s Licensing Unit said: 'Mynott has assaulted two people for doing their jobs. The doorman was trying restore order in the nightclub by removing Mynott when he started being abusive to those around him.

'And then Mynott has assaulted an officer responding to Mynott’s assault of the doorman during the lawful execution of her duty.

'These actions are completely unacceptable, and we welcome the magistrates’ decision to imprison Mynott. As both of these assaults were fuelled by alcohol, we also sought a Drinking Banning Order.

She added: 'We will continue to seek Drinking Banning Orders in a bid to reduce the amount of alcohol-fuelled offenders who are harming others, as they are a great way to protect the public and licensed says that he studied 'at the streets' and claimed to have money.

His last post read: 'I’m getting mad that the people in the estate agents just keep saying they dont have any properties that will suit me - even though I got the cash to move in today. F***in' k****.'
