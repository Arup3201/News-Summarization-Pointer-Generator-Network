Violence is a bigger threat to the health of European women than cancer, according to Bianca Jagger, the campaigner and first wife of rock star Mick.

While her former husband was playing with The Rolling Stones in London’s Hyde Park, Miss Jagger, 68, gave an impassioned speech calling on world leaders to prevent physical and sexual assaults.

‘The stark reality is women and girls are still a vulnerable group.

'We face unconscionable levels of discrimination and violence,’ she told an audience in Berlin, which included actress Nicole Kidman, a goodwill ambassador to the UN. 

‘Across Europe, violence is a bigger danger to women than cancer, with 45 per cent of women experiencing some kind of physical or sexual violence.’

According to the UN, up to  six in ten women around the world experience physical or sexual violence in their lifetime. In South Africa, one is killed every six hours by her partner.

In Guatemala, two are murdered, on average, each day.

However, the developed world is not exempt, Miss Jagger said. ‘Last year in the UK, 60,000 women were raped, over 400,000 were sexually assaulted and 1.2 million suffered domestic abuse, according to the Home Office,’ she added.

Yet despite this, she pointed out, there were only 5,651 rape prosecutions and 111,891 for domestic violence in England and Wales.

‘Failure of governments to protect the rights of women continues to hinder gender equality all over the world.

'It is a grave injustice which holds us back as a society,’ she said.
