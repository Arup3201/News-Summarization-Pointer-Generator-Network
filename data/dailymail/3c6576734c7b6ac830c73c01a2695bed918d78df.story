There may be times when you really want to tell your colleagues what you think of them, but are left biting your tongue.

Knozen offers a solution.

The free app lets you anonymously pit co-workers against each other based on how good they are at their job, and their personality traits - and will rate them on each quality.

The Knozen app pits two people against each other using a range of questions. Some are work related, while others assess personality traits, such as 'Who would leave work early for a date?' (pictured left) and 'Who would pack for a trip way in advance?' Each time a user is rated (pictured right), they are sent a notification

Examples include ‘Who would leave work early for a date?’, ‘Who is more assertive?’ and ‘Who would pack for a trip way in advance?’

Researchers at the University of Illinois and University of Pennsylvania recently discovered that people who moan a lot may be better at their jobs.

This is because the so-called 'haters' may be more skilled because they spend time on fewer activities.

In contrast, people with a sunny disposition tend to spread their time over lots of activities.

This, the researchers claim, makes them a 'Jack-of-all-trades' and a master of none.

The user then selects the best match, before being given another question and two possible colleagues.

Colleagues are selected at random.

Each of the questions are designed to be ‘positive and upbeat’ – meaning users can't be brutally honest with people they don’t like.

However, they could rate other colleagues higher at the detriment of those they don’t get on with.

Each time a user is rated, they get a notification saying what they were rated for.

These ratings are saved and shown on their profile, which reveals their strongest traits, based on the answers.

At least seven people from a firm need to
 sign up to the app before they can begin rating each other. This is 
done to protect each user’s identity.

Knozen was developed by New York-based Marc Cenedella.

The app has already received $2.25 million in funding and launched on the app store last week - although it is rolling out gradually to different regions so may not be available in some locations yet.

A recent survey found that having the 
right skills is an important part of being considered for a job, but 
possessing the right personality traits is apparently even more 
essential.

In
 digital education company Hyper Island's study of 500 business 
leaders, 78 per cent cited 
'personality' as the most desirable quality in an employee.

And the top traits in this category were found to be 'driven', 'creative' and 'open-minded'.

The
 most important quality after personality, according to the survey, is 
'cultural alignment'.

A person's skill-set was rated the third most important quality, 
with just 39 per cent of the vote.
