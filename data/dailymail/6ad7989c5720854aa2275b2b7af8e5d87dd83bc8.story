A Georgia hunter has captured one of the largest alligators ever found in the state.

The trophy behemoth — 13 feet, 660 lbs. — was caught at Lake Blackshear on Thursday night after struggling against Chad Young and his hunting buddies for more than four hours, WALB reported.

'Basically it was like taking a full size truck and hooking it to your 
boat,' Young told the station.

'He had plenty of power and he didn't slow down for a 
while.'

A Georgia hunter has captured this massive alligator. The incredible stats: 13 feet, 660 lbs.

It took a truck and six men to move the alligator

Hunter Chad Young had to shoot the alligator at least six times and struggled with it for hours before it was finally brought down

At first, Young and his companions thought the gator was only about 7 or 8 feet 
long. 

'We pulled him up to put another line in him and we seen the size of his head and he actually pulled his head over into the boat,' Young told WALB. 'That's when we knew we had to have way more help.'

In the end, it took Young six bullets to get the alligator down  — and a total of six men and a truck to move the beast.

'I
 wouldn't say scared, but I was more nervous about losing him than 
anything,' Young, who plans to have the animal's head mounted, told WALB.

'The amount of power he had for the 
length of time he had. It was ridiculous.'

The largest alligator captured in Georgia in the last 12 years measured 13 feet, 11 inches long and was hunted last year, according to the Georgia Department of Natural Resources.
