Burnley's players have been seeing a psychologist to prepare them for the mental battle of staying in the Premier League.

Sean Dyche’s team were promoted against the odds in April and are favourites to go straight back down again ahead of their opening game against Chelsea at Turf Moor on Monday night.

Burnley captain Jason Shackell revealed that Dyche has called in sports psychologist Simon Clarkson since taking over nearly two years ago, and the players are now ready for what promises to be a season of struggle.

Simon says: Burnley captain Jason Shackell revealed manager Sean Dyche has called in a sports psychologist

‘He delivers a little presentation with quite powerful messages and I think the lads buy into everything he’s done,’ said Shackell.

‘There are key messages and he thinks a little bit outside the box, which is nice.

‘The general message is we’re not going to get it all like we did last year, but it’s not getting too low with the lows and not getting too high with the highs. It’s just trying to keep it on a nice even keel and take one game at a time.’

Burnley were strongly tipped for relegation from the Championship last year as well before going up in second place, and Shackell believes his side thrive when they are written off.

‘It brings a certain freedom and freedom can be a powerful thing,’ he said.

‘With the pressure off, there’s no weight on our shoulders.’
