Warning: Dr Connie Mariano, former head of the White House Medical Unit, said that Christie should lose weight if he wants to run for president

The former White House doctor who Chris Christie told to 'shut up' after she criticized his weight said she also received an angry phone call from the New Jersey Governor.

Christie attacked Arizona physician Connie Mariano during a press conference earlier in the week but the woman has revealed he called her and yelled at her over the phone.

'It was essentially the tone of the press conference, only louder,' she told 3TV. 'It was hard to get anything across.'

Mariano said Christie's behaviour had made her consider withdrawing her support for the politician, who is a potential presidential candidate for 2016.

'The way he acted lately I don't think so. He wasn't very nice to me,' the doctor said.

'Politically, if this is the way (he handles) stress... is this presidential? I'll have to think about that. Is this a presidential way to behave? C'mon.'

Mariano said she had received a barrage of harsh comments from Christie supporters after her remarks.

'I've gotten lots of hate mails, lots of threatening, mean stuff. My intention wasn't to hurt anybody,' she said.

The woman, who was the White House doctor for nine years, encompassing both Bush administrations and Clinton's time as president, said she thought Christie may have gotten her mixed up.

'I don't think he realized who he was talking to,' Mariano told 3TV. She said that it was common for medical experts to give their opinions on the health concerns of potential presidential candidates.

'I think I'm qualified to make a comment,' she added.

The fierce row was sparked when Christie made a joke about his size on Late Night with David Letterman, at one point whipping out a donut from his pocket to drive the self-deprecation home.

Hungry man: The doctor's comments came just two days after the Governor poked fun at himself by pulling a donut from his pocket halfway through his interview with David Letterman

The Republican rising star then lashed
 out at the former White House doctor after she labelled his stunt 'sad'
 and said that he should lose weight before considering a run for the 
presidency.

'Iâ€™m worried about this man dying in office,' Mariano said in an interview with CN.

'I can understand why his doctors and 
other people have had trouble getting him to lose weight. This is an 
issue that will haunt him if he decides to run for office,' she said.

She even said that she would like to see him go for the top job, but that didn't help to soften the blow.

But Christie's backlash was harsh, claiming on Wednesday that since 
Dr Mariano hasn't given him a physical exam or heard anything about his 
family history, 'she should shut up'.

'I
 find it fascinating that a doctor in Arizona -- who's never met me, 
never examined me, never reviewed my medical history or records and 
knows nothing about my family history -- could make a diagnosis from 
2,400 miles away,' he said.

Good taste: Letterman has poked fun of Christie's weight in several late-night monologues and the Republican showed that he could take a joke, but he wasn't as light hearted when it came to issues about a possible run

On Letterman's show, a
 good portion of their conversation was dedicated to the talk show 
host's habit of making fun of the 50-year-old governor's girth.

He joked, following a recent 
physical that showed his blood sugar and cholesterol levels to be in 
acceptable ranges: 'I'm basically the healthiest fat guy you've
 ever seen in your life.'

That remark was off-putting for Mariano, who responded in a live phone interview on CNN saying: 'I 
thought it was very sad that he made fun of that.'

'I'm not a hack. If you look up my 
resume, I've been in the White House for nine years. I'm a retired Navy 
rear admiral. I'm board-certified in internal medicine.'

She ended the interview abruptly as she said that the Governor was calling her at that very moment.

He admitted that his size was 'fair 
game' for comedians, but he followed their night of laughs up with a 
more serious admission the next day.

Christie told reporters on Tuesday 
that even though he is 'remarkably healthy', his doctor 'continues to 
warn me that my luck is going to run out relatively soon.'

This is far from a new issue, as the 
questions began to arise about whether his weight would hinder a 
possible presidential run when he was suggested as a potential Republican
 candidate early on in the 2012 race.

It came up again when he was thought to be a front-runner for Mitt Romney's running mate.

He
 directly addressed the issue when he sat down with Barbara Walters in 
December after being selected as one of her 'most fascinating people' of
 the year.

She asked the governor and possible Republican presidential nominee if he agrees with the criticism that he is too fat to run for the position of Commander in Chief.

'That's ridiculous, I mean that's ridiculous- I don't know what the basis for that is,' he said in the interview.

One of the concerns often cited by his critics is that the 50-year-old politician's obesity increases the risk of health problems like possible Type 2 diabetes, heart disease and certain types of cancers.

'I've done this job pretty well, and I think people have watched me for the last number of weeks with Hurricane Sandy doing 18 hour days and getting right back up the next day and still being just as effective in the job, so I don't really think that would be a problem,' he said in response.
