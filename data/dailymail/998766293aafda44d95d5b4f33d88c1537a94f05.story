From Terry Wogan to Britney Spears, the stars were out in force to audition in Channel 4's 'Andy Murray: The Movie'.

The short film, which was part of Friday's Stand Up To Cancer telethon, featured a string of high-profile names from the sporting world to the music industry.

Chelsea's Spanish midfielder Cesc Fabregas auditioned for the lead role but was stopped short after claiming Rafael Nadal was the 'greatest player of his generation' instead of 2013 Wimbledon champion Murray.
