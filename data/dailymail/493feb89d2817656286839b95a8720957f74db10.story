The Blues striker scored during the 2-1 defeat at Newcastle last weekend, continuing his fine recent form for Jose Mourinho’s side.

With a flurry of fixtures on the horizon, Mourinho has decided to rest captain John Terry and midfielders Eden Hazard and Willian for the Champions League tie with Sporting Lisbon on Wednesday evening, having already qualified for the last 16.

However Mourinho confirmed striker Diego Costa will start against the Portuguese side despite concerns over his fitness, leaving Drogba’s participation in doubt.
