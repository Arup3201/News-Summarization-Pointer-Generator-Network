He is portrayed as a brutish ape-man, prowling around for prey to spear for dinner.

But scientists now believe Neanderthal man was actually more of the stay-at-home type.

Researchers at Cambridge University have found evidence our early ancestors may have spent most of their time carrying out tedious domestic chores.

Their remains show they had very big right arms - some 50 per cent stronger than their left arms - which has previously been put down to hunting big game with spears.

Mighty hunter or domestic God? Researchers at Cambridge University have found evidence our early ancestors may have spent most of their time carrying out tedious domestic chores

Hunters - or home-makers? ¿For much of the time Neanderthals might have been performing other tasks, such as preparing skins, which changes our picture of their daily activities.¿

However a new analysis suggests hunting would not have had this effect, and their bone structure is more likely to be the result of hours spent scraping animals hides to make clothes.

It was the Ice Age when the Neanderthals roamed Europe and they would have need to wear furs to survive.

Dr Colin Shaw, an archaeologist, said: ‘The skeletal remains suggest that Neanderthals were doing something intense or repetitive, or both, that had a significant role in their lives. The question is what was it?

‘The main theory until now is that it was hunting of mammoths and deer, which has coloured our view of the Neanderthal as a hunter. But we have shown it would not have had the effect we have seen on the bones.

‘For much of the time Neanderthals might have been performing other tasks, such as preparing skins, which changes our picture of their daily activities.’

The researchers say the shape of the humerus bones which have survived – the long bone which runs from the shoulder to elbow – show the Neanderthals right upper arms were unusually strong.

Most right-handed people have arms which are 10 per cent stronger than the left. The disparity in Neanderthals arms is only seen in people such as tennis players.

An international team of researchers led by the Universitat Autònoma 
de Barcelona and the University of York, has found the first molecular 
evidence that Neanderthals not only ate a range of cooked plant foods, 
but also understood its nutritional and medicinal qualities.

Until recently Neanderthals, who disappeared between 30,000 and 
24,000 years ago, were thought to be predominantly meat-eaters.

However, researchers from Spain, the UK and Australia combined pyrolysis 
gas-chromatography-mass spectrometry with an analysis of 
plant microfossils to identify material trapped in calcified dental plaque from five Neanderthals from the north Spanish 
site of El Sidrón.

Dr Shaw’s team used right-handed volunteers to carry out spear throwing and scraping tasks, while the muscle activity in their chest and shoulder – which influences the movement of this upper arm bone - was measured using electrodes.

He said: ‘We found that not only was it unlikely that the Neanderthals were throwing spears as regularly as a tennis player hits the ball, but it was not having this effect on their right arm.

‘Although it was thought the right arm would have been holding the back of the spear and doing the thrusting. It was making their left arm, which was closer to the target, slightly stronger.

‘However during the scraping task we saw activity consistent with their arm shape, so that is a plausible explanation.’

One of the tools most often found with Neanderthal remains in Europe is a ‘side scraper’ used to scrape soft tissue from the underside of animal hides, which needed to be removed so it did not rot.

The researchers said Neanderthals would have needed around six skins to make one outfit and needed to make one for each member of their family every year.

It was a laborious task, as studies of Eskimos and African hunters shows even experienced people would take about eight hours to scrape a single hide.

Dr Shaw, from the PAVE research groups and McDonald Institute for Archaeological Research, said: ‘Preparing several hides for each member of the community would have require exactly the sort of repetitious activity attested to by the overdeveloped arms of Neanderthal skeletons.’

It paints a new picture of our caveman ancestors who, if they spent a lot more time at home, could have got involved in cooking, child care, butchering and tool making.

Neanderthals, who roamed Europe and the Middle East for around 100,000 years, are generally thought of as uncivilised creatures who were out-witted and out-hunted by modern humans around 35,000 years ago.

But recent studies have increasingly suggested that they were actually far more sophisticated than previously thought, living in communities, eating cooked food, making complex tools and even interbreeding with humans.
