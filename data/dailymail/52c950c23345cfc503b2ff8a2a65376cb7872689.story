The Prince of Wales has concluded his trip to the Middle East by meeting members of the Royal Navy who are fighting pirates off the coast of Africa.

On his last day in Oman, Charles visited HMS Northumberland, which is currently docked in the capital Muscat.

He was given a tour of the 436ft (133m) long ship and shown the various aspects of its mission, and also awarded medals to two crew members for long service and good conduct.

and successful job.

'I also want to say how much, for what its worth, I admire what you do and the way you carry out your duties all over the world.

'To keep providing the service that you do with shrinking resources is truly remarkable.
