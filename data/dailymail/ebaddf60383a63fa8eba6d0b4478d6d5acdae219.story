The makers of the latest edition of FIFA 15 have promised it to be the most realistic ever, with the new 'Parking the Bus' mode a welcome addition to the game - especially if you're Jose Mourinho.

The brand new feature will allow you to set all of your players to drop back into their own area and frustrate the opposition, all with the click of a button.

Mourinho has previously criticised the likes of Sam Allardyce and Tim Sherwood for adopting the tactic.

However, the 51-year-old, who all the way back in 2004 famously vented his frustration at Tottenham for parking the bus at Stamford Bridge in a 0-0 draw, may well be a fan of the new feature after masterclassing the tactic in the past.

The most prominent example of that was when his Inter Milan side produced a defensive masterclass to hold on at the Nou Camp and earn a place in the 2010 Champions League final.

He also utilised it effectively last season as Chelsea secured a 2-0 win at Anfield in April, as a result stemming criticism from his counterpart and friend Brendan Rodgers.

Whether Jose likes it or not it is bound to be a hit with people playing the game who are holding out for a draw or better holding on to a 1-0 lead.
