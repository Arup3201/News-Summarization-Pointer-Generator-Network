He might be only 3ft 5ins, but the world’s champion arm wrestler has started his gruelling training regime to conquer Mount Everest.

Joby Matthew, 36, from Kerala, in southern India, has severely under-developed legs, a condition caused by Proximal Fimoral Focal Deficiency, but that hasn’t stopped the father-of-one.

He has achieved a long list of accolades that most able-bodied people struggle to achieve.

Determined: Joby Matthew, 36, from Kerala, in southern India, has severely under-developed legs, a condition caused by Proximal Fimoral Focal Deficiency, but that hasn't stopped the father-of-one

In August this year he won two gold medals in badminton and one each in javelin, discus throw and shot put at the 6th World Dwarf Games, held in Michigan, USA.

And now, he has just returned home after a month in New Zealand for a gruelling training regime in his quest to climb to the top of Mount Everest.

He said: ‘I have a few dreams left but the most important one is to climb Mount Everest. I am preparing for it and I’ve started the training. I will accomplish it. I’m determined.’

Mr Matthew, who is married to 5ft 6ins Megha and has a four-year-old son Jyothis, has always had a very positive outlook.

As a child he always focused on things he could do and not the things he couldn’t do.

But now Mr Matthew is attempting his biggest challenge yet.

He added: ‘This is going to be harder than anything I’ve ever done in the past. I’ve always concentrated on sports that my body has been able to withstand but this trek will be something that my body will not necessarily be comfortable with. It will take immense strength, endurance and commitment but I’m ready.’

Mr Matthew, who weighs 9st, found his determination in life from experiencing many difficulties from a very young age.

At school he became determined to overcome his disability when he was unable to play sports with other students.

He said: 'I had many painful experiences being left out of games and sports growing up and so I was determined to have some achievements of my own and I concentrated on the things I could do with my body. My arms were the key.’

Mr Matthew spent years going to see doctors but they were always very clear that there was no medicine or cure available for his condition.

‘At times I used to be sad about my condition and I was desperate to be normal,’ he said. ‘But as soon as I accepted that nothing was going to change I committed myself to changing my own future.  

‘I’ve worked very hard for the last 22 years to develop my upper body and thankfully I have been successful.’

Mr Matthew, who hits the gym for an hour every day before swimming in a local river, started entering arm wrestling competitions locally when he was in school but it wasn’t always a success.

‘I remember one of my first district competitions. I was very excited and was confident I’d win but I lost. I was broken. I remember going to the bathroom and I cried for half an hour. I was very angry with myself but then I realised the sadness wouldn’t get me anywhere and I decided to fight back. The next competition I entered I won.’

His wife Megha, a classical dancer, met Joby in 2005 and they got married in 2008.

She said: ‘His so-called disability never bothered me. Right from the day I met him I was amazed with his physical and mental capabilities.

‘If anything his determination often makes me a little nerbous. In 2008, when his flight was cancelled last minute, he drove his scooter the 550 km distance from Kochi to Chennai to participate in a sports event. This year he drove his car about 2,000 km to reach Odisha in just 48 hours for another.’

Mr Matthew is now the current World Champion of five different sports - arm wrestling, badminton, shot put, and javelin and discuss/

‘I have won over 16 international and national competitions and I’ll keep on striving for new titles,’ he added.

‘Reaching the top of Mount Everest will be by far the best.’
