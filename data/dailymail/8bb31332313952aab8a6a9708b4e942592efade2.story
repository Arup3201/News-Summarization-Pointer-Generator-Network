Saved by first aid: Talk show host Matthew Wright nearly choked to death

I’m A Celebrity star Matthew Wright is the latest personality to sign up to support Everyday Heroes, the St John Ambulance awards – run in association with The Mail on Sunday – that honour those who have given life-saving first aid.

The Wright Stuff chat show host, pictured right, who will be a guest at  the awards, knows only too well the value of survival skills.

His life  was saved by first aid when a friend stopped him choking on a piece of steak.

Matthew was eating dinner at a pub when a piece of meat became lodged in his throat, blocking his windpipe.

‘I really thought I was a goner,’ says Matthew, who tried drinking water in a futile attempt to clear his throat.

He then started losing colour in his face as he struggled for air.

Thankfully, someone in the pub knew what  to do and dislodged the food using abdominal thrusts.

‘If it wasn’t for first aid, I’ve no doubt what the outcome  would have been,’  says Matthew.

‘I was really lucky that  I wasn’t one of those people who die each year because no one around them knew  basic first aid.’

There is still time to nominate your own  hero before entries close on December 13, and Mail on Sunday readers will be invited to vote in our special category, the Guy Evans Young Hero Award, with the finalists being featured in these pages.

There are nine categories, recognising both individuals and organisations. Winners will be honoured at a glittering event in March hosted by Strictly Come Dancing’s Tess Daly.

James Middtleton said recently he wanted ‘Movember’ extended into ‘Decembeard’ – so he’ll be pleased to know it already exists.

Men are being encouraged to grow some whiskers this month by charities Beating Bowel Cancer and Bowel Cancer UK to raise funds for and awareness of the disease, which is on the rise in Britain.

James has a major head start – he’s been modelling his beard for months.

New research by Bowel Cancer UK shows greater awareness of bowel cancer is badly needed. Almost half of men can’t name two symptoms of the disease – these include rectal bleeding, stomach pain and weight loss. Diagnoses have increased by  30 per cent in the past 35 years.

Knee replacement surgery is now  more popular than hip replacement operations. Last year, 90,842 knee ops were performed in the UK, compared with 86,488 for hips.

Professor Alan Silman, medical director of Arthritis UK, says: ‘It is because the population is getting older and more  obese but also because they are increasingly being carried out on people under the age of 50.’

Twenty-eight per cent of the UK population is reported to suffer knee pain.

OJ OK: Drinking orange juice could help you live longer

The high natural sugar content in fruit juice usually gives it a bad press, but new research suggests that orange juice could lead to a longer life.

It was one of a number of foods linked to longevity during a study at the University of Athens.

Researchers also identified wine, nuts, probiotics, olive oil – and chocolate.

Drinking orange juice during a meal was found to have a beneficial effect on insulin, as well as being linked to a reduced risk of heart disease and stroke.

‘Diet may play a substantial role in promoting human health and prolonging life,’ say the researchers, who report their findings in the journal Maturitas.

Sitting down for long periods has been linked to illnesses  ranging from diabetes and high blood pressure to high cholesterol and cardiovascular disease.

As many people are employed in deskbound jobs, inventive manufacturers are coming up with solutions.

Hot on the heels of the Treadmill Desk (£1,999, lifespan-fitness.co.uk) comes the FitDesk, a folding exercise bike that boasts a sliding platform to hold your laptop.
