Robert Pires has followed former Arsenal team-mate Freddie Ljungberg in signing up for the inaugural Indian Super League.

It was announced last week that former Sweden midfielder Ljungberg had penned an ambassadorial contract with the ISL, while Pires is expected to line up for one of the league's eight teams.

The 40-year-old Frenchman spent time with Villarreal and Aston Villa following his six-year spell at Arsenal and will now ply his trade in Asia, although details of which team he will play for are yet to be released.

'It will be great to play in front of enthusiastic Indian fans as well as share my knowledge with my team-mates.'
