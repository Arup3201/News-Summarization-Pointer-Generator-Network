The federal government has shut down, closing national parks and monuments and furloughing hundreds of thousands of employees, including airline safety inspectors.

The closings and furloughs are the result of Congress's failure to come to a budget compromise that would have kept the government funded beyond Monday's midnight deadline.

The Statue of Liberty has closed its doors, trash could soon begin piling up around the nation's capital and even the fountains on the National Mall will run dry. Among the 800,000 furloughed employees are nearly 3,000 airline safety inspectors and 90 percent of workers at national museums.
