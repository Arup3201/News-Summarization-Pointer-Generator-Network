Martin Samuel's attack on the Champions League seeding system 

UEFA have confirmed a revamp to their seeding allocation for the Champions League.

From the 2015-16 campaign, the champions from the top seven leagues in Europe will feature as top seeds along with the holders of the competition. 

Sportsmail's Chief Sports Writer Martin Samuel attacked the current seeding system, highlighting the absurdity of Arsenal, who finished fourth in the Premier League last season, being in Pot 1 while title winners Manchester City were in Pot 2.

Manchester City would be top seeds in the Champions League if they retain their Premier League title

But for Arsenal, the new rules leave them on the cusp of losing their top seed place in the Champions League having not won the Premier League title in over 10 years

Were the new rules in play this season, here's how Pot 1 would have looked:

1 Spain - Atletico

2 England - Manchester City

3 Germany - Bayern Munich

4 Portugal - Benfica

5 Italy - Juventus

6 Russia - CSKA Moscow

7 France - PSG

8 Holders - Real Madrid

But Sky Sports News has revealed that talks  took place earlier this year and the plans over seeding - which are the same as Samuel outlined in Sportsmail - were approved by the club competition committee in May.

UEFA president Michel Platini hopes the rules would stop domestic champions in the major European leagues being ranked lower than other clubs from their nations.

It would also prevent situations like in this season's Group A where the champions of Italy (Juventus), Spain (Atletico Madrid), Holland (Ajax) and Sweden (Malmo) are all in together. 

The system currently works on the co-efficient system, where clubs' previous Champions League performances and the ranking of their domestic league is taken into account.

The latest seeding rules will come as bad news for the likes of Arsenal and Manchester United, should they qualify for the Champions League but not win the Barclays Premier League or, in Arsenal’s case, not land the biggest prize in European football this season. 

Both clubs have previously enjoyed top-seed status due to their high UEFA coefficient.

Under the new rules, only the Premier League champions would go into pot one next season.
