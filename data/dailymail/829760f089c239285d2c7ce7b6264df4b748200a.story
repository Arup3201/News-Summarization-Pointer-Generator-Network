Steven Caulker was taken to hospital with a cut head after QPR and Crystal Palace players met up at a London pub.

Rangers officials confirmed that the one-cap England defender needed treatment – although they insisted the 22-year-old was not involved in any sort of fight, and it is claimed that he slipped and fell.

Reports claimed trouble broke out on Sunday afternoon when players from both sides were out to celebrate good results from the day before.

The incident is said to have occurred at the Ship Inn, in Wandsworth, London

Rangers manager Harry Redknapp had forbidden his players from having any sort of Christmas party – but did agree they could meet up for Sunday lunch.

A witness told the Sun: 'Caulker split his head open and blood was pouring down his face. There was claret everywhere. The players piled out of the pub but the bouncers stopped us leaving.

'Joey Barton was the peacemaker. When it all kicked off, he was in the middle trying to break it up. It was horrible.

'We saw a woman in her early 20s spill a drink on Rio. Rio got up and was clearly angry. Shaun Wright-Phillips was telling him to calm down,' the witness added.

'Jody Morris was also saying to take it wasy. It all escalated into a load of shouting. Rio then left in a cab before Steven went outside.'

A statement released by the club said: 'Following Saturday's Premier League win versus Burnley & with no further fixture for nine days the club can confirm players were allowed to have a Sunday lunch together.

'Steven Caulker was not involved in an altercation. He did suffer a cut to his head, which he received treatment for at hospital before being discharged on the same evening.

'The club will be making no further comment.'

QPR owner Tony Fernandes took to Twitter to play down the reports.

He wrote: 'I'm aware of some headlines appearing in tomorrow [Tuesday's] newspaper. After a great win boys were given permission for a Sunday lunch.

'Team is very united and really playing for each other. Steven Caulker slipped over and hurt his head and is fine. Nothing else to report.

'Great team spirit. We are one. Best I've seen since being chairman. A few sensational headlines but team has done us proud.'
