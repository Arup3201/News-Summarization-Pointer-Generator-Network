A five-pound chihuahua showed up at a California animal shelter limping and was given an X-ray. To the shock of veterinarians, the scan showed nine sewing needles lodged in his abdomen.

Yoda, a stray, underwent emergency surgery at Orange County Animal Care after vets discovered the needles.

Even more astonishing was Yoda's miraculous return to life after the removal of one pin piercing his heart stopped his heartbeat during surgery for 15 minutes.

Shocking: A stray chihuahua in California was found to have nine sewing needles lodged in his internal organs

Heart-stopping: Dr Diane Craig performed the surgery on Yoda and managed to save the little dog

‘[The needles] had just left the 
stomach and were going through the liver, through the diaphragm and were
headed into his chest,’ Dr Diane Craig, who operated on the dog, told 
CBSLA.

Craig said in 30 
years of veterinary surgery, she's never seen anything like Yoda's case.
The needles were poking holes in the dog's lungs, and she knew that if 
she didn't operate swiftly, Yoda would die.

The vet said she has no idea how the needles ended up inside Yoda, but she suspects it wasn’t an accident.

'It’s hard to imagine a dog would voluntarily eat nine sewing needles,' she told CBSLA.

The force is with him: Yoda's heart stopped for 15 minutes before he came back to life when the vet used a defibrillator

In surgery, Craig required the assistance of another veterinary surgeon and a support staff of five to try to save the little dog.

'We had this dog's chest and abdomen open at the same time,' she she said of the unprecedented surgery.

All sewn up: Yoda's chest and abdomen were cut open to allow vets to remove all the pins from his system

Lifesaver: Dr Diane Craig has 30 years veterinary surgery experience, but even she was taken aback by Yoda's X-rays

At one point, she used a magnet to remove a pin piercing Yoda's heart, after which it stopped beating.

Craig worked for fifteen minutes massaging the tiny heart to no avail.

In an unusual move, the vet chose to defibrillate the tiny dog.

Remarkably, Yoda came back to life.

Little miracle: Yoda is now looking for a permanent home

'That, for us, kinda makes him a miracle,' said a shelter staff member.

Yoda is expected to fully recover as he waits at a foster home to be adopted.

Those interested in giving to the shelter to offset the $9,000 surgery costs may do so through OC Animal Care.
