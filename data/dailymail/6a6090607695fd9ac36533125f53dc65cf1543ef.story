It is a sight which will be the envy of teenagers up and down the country.

Arguments between children and their parents over eating healthy meals is a daily occurrence in many households.

But for 15-year-old Lee Jones, it isn't an issue. 

Teenager's dream: Lee Jones, 15, has to eat an enormous plate-full of fry-ups every day just to survive

That's because he has to eat an enormous plate-full of fry-ups every day just to survive.

The teen has a rare condition which means his body cannot process glucose.

So rather than being made to eat his greens like other teenagers, he has been told to eat regular fatty meals.

Fatty: Each week he eats an incredible 56 sausages, 24 burgers, 24 rashers of bacon and three jars of peanut butter

Each week he eats an incredible 56 sausages, 24 burgers, 24 rashers of bacon and three jars of peanut butter,.

He will also eat seven tubs of double cream, a jar of mayonnaise and a litre -and-a-half of olive oil.

Lee, who lives in Croydon, South London, cannot eat anything sugary, so sweets are banned along with bread and pizzas. 

Speaking to The Sun, he said: 'Most of my friends are jealous that I get to eat loads of fried stuff.

'I'm glad I never have to eat mashed potato again but I miss chips and chocolate and crisps.'

Lee's one-in-14-million condition is called GLUT1.

Without his special diet - called 'ketogenic' - it would result in brain damage which could lead to seizures and other problems.

At the age of three he was diagnosed with autism and by seven, doctors told him he had epilepsy. But he still suffered from crippling seizures as he got older.

Eventually, a neurologist identified his condition, which less than 500 people suffer from worldwide.

After he was told to eat his high-fat diet, his condition improved and he has been able to perform better in school.

His mum, Ayse Parker, 34, said she has to put double cream and mayonnaise in everything that her son eats.

She added: 'He will be sat at the dinner table with a big pile of sausages and burgers while I try to cook healthy meals for the other kids.'
