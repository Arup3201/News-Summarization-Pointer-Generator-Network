How long before your baby made his Facebook debut?

Whether Instagrammed, tweeted about or used in cutesy Facebook photo updates, most newborn babies are now making their international photographic debut on social media sites within one hour of their birth.

More than two-thirds of newborns now appear online within 60 minutes, while the birth of Prince George encouraged 74 per cent of parents to increase the amount of baby and children snaps they uploaded, according to research.

Parents were asked how soon it was after 
their child was born that an image appeared on social media, and the 
average time period was 57.9 minutes.

When questioned on who specifically 
uploaded these images, only 62 per cent of parents acknowledged they did
 it themselves, with other family members (22 per cent) and friends (16 
per cent) responsible for posting the remaining images.

Most newborns have their photo posted on social media site less than 60 minutes after being born, with Facebook the most popular place to show off your new child

The most popular outlets for displaying these images were Facebook (77 per cent), Instagram (48 per cent) and Flickr (32 per cent)

The poll by print site Posterista, which surveyed 2,367 parents of children aged five and under, aimed to discover the impact social media have had on the way new parents share information and images of their offspring.

Of the individuals polled in the study, 64 per cent admitted that they upload images of their children to social media outlets at least three times a week, while 21 per cent said at least three times a month, and only 6 per cent said they never upload pictures of their children to their social pages.

The top five reasons cited for sharing these images online included keeping distant family and friends updated (56 per cent), expressing love for their children (49 per cent), describing it as an ideal location to store memories (34 per cent), saying it is a great way to record children's early years (28 per cent), and to brag to and 'better' other parents' photos (22 per cent).

Almost three-quarters of those questioned admitted that the recent hysteria and buzz surrounding the royal birth led to them noticing an increased amount of pictures uploaded of children from themselves, as well as their friends and family on social media pages.

Marc Phelps, the site's co-founder, said: 'The fact that a picture of the average newborn is now online within an hour just goes to highlight the enormous impact social media has had on our lives in the past five years, and how prevalent these pages are in helping to keep loved ones informed on the special occasions in our lives, such as the birth of a new child.'
