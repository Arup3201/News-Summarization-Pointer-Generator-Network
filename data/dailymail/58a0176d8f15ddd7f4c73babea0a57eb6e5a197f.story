Energy and vitamin-enhanced drinks do not boost mental or physical health, a damning study has claimed.

In fact, many of the benefits being claimed have no foundation in nutritional science either, said the report by university academics.

The drinks boast of being packed with various nutrients and vitamins making claims to improve everything from concentration to improving mood.

But many young people get their daily intake of many of these vitamins in other ways, researchers told the journal Applied Physiology, Nutrition and Metabolism.

Nutritional scientists from Canada's University of Toronto and Ryerson University, looked at the ingredients and claimed benefits of brands from local supermarkets. 

These included energy drinks, vitamin waters and juices with added nutrients, most commonly the vitamins B6, B12, C and niacin.

But with the possible exception of vitamin C, most young adults are already getting their daily recommended levels of these nutrients anyway, said researcher Naomi Dachner.

She said: 'While our findings suggest that consumers stand to reap little or no benefit from the nutrient additions in novel beverages, most products were being marketed as if they provided a unique benefit to the consumer through the nutrient additions.'

The brands are, typically, aimed at young adults claiming to give them renewed vigour and energy, help them to focus or revive them after a late night, for example.

Ms Dachner said the ingredients of such drinks do not 'address existing nutrient inadequacies in the population'. 

The report said: 'Labels 'highlighted nutritional attributes such as immune support and antioxidant properties, and some made claims related to specific nutrients.

It added: 'In addition, nutrients were often juxtaposed with messages related to performance and emotional well-being, benefits that go beyond conventional nutritional science.'

And 'young adults - the likely target group for these products - are already consuming enough of these nutrients to meet their needs.'

The researchers said measures were needed to 'ensure that consumers of [such] beverages are not misled or exposed to unnecessarily high nutrient loads with no potential benefit.'
