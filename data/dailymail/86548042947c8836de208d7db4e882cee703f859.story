There was a time when wine-lovers would turn their nose up at a bottle of English rosé.

But now, for rosé makers, it seems everything's looking... rosy.

According to Marks & Spencer sales of its pink plonk are soaring this summer. 

This year's English Pinot Noir rosé, produced just a few miles from the M25, has been particularly popular with more than 500,000 bottles being sold at £11.99 in just a month in June and July.

Garry Brooking, of M&S, said customers had shown a particular taste for dry rosé wines, including the English Pinot Noir.

'We always expect rosé sales to increase during the summer, but the fact that our English rosé has sold out so rapidly is testament to how far the country's wines have come, as well as changing consumer taste,' he said.

'Sales of rosés from Europe have dominated this year, showing that our customers are starting to prefer the lighter, drier styles produced in these countries.'

The wine is produced at Denbies wine estate on the North Downs in Surrey which, at 265 acres, is the UK's largest single estate vineyard.

M&S stocks 44 different rosés and its winemakers are continuously exploring different countries and blends to bring new and exciting wines to its customers. 

The top-selling rosé wine at M&S was a Spanish Raso de la Cruz, at almost £7 a bottle, followed by an Italian Monferrato Chiaretto rosé at £7.49 and the French Domaine de la Navarre Côtes de Provence rosé.

Among the more unusual introductions to the British market this year was the Jewel of Nasik Indian Zinfandel rosé.
