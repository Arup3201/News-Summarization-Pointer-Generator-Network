America's fattest and thinnest places have been revealed in a new survey which highlights the continuing national obesity crisis.

Huntington-Ashland, a metropolitan area which covers parts of Ohio, West Virginia, and Kentucky, has been revealed as the nation's fattest location with 39.5 per cent of adults classed as obese, based on data collected between January 2012 and December 2013.

In a separate survey last month, Hutington was also named as the most miserable place in the US, largely thanks to residents' poor health. Boulder, Colorado, scooped the award for thinnest area in the U.S. with just 12.4 per cent of the population tipping the scales as obese.

Named and shamed: A survey has revealed the fattest and thinnest places in America, with Huntington-Ashland faring the worst, with nearly two in five adults being obese (map shows main city in each area surveyed)

Huntington-Ashland, Ohio, has been named the fattest place in America as a separate survey reveals it is also the second-most miserable location. Boulder, Colorado, has been the thinnest place in the States since 2011

The new figures reveal that, since the last survey was done in 2011, Huntington-Ashland residents have become heavier. In 2012 the area had an obesity rate of 36 per cent and ranked third in the table.

Of all 10 locations featured in the top 10 in 2011, it is also the only place to have moved up the rankings.

McCallen, Texas, remains in the top 10 but has dropped one place to second, while Charleston, West Virgina, has stayed at number 6.

In 2011 Boulder was also the thinnest location, although on that occasion only 12.1 per cent of people were obese, meaning the city's residents have also become fatter over the last two years.

In a separate survey Huntington-Ashland was also revealed to be the most miserable area in the U.S., just in front of Charleston, West Virginia.

Nearly one in ten residents has previously had a heart attack. They also reported the lowest levels of emotional health, had lower evaluations of their own lives than any other US city, and were more likely to feel worried or depressed than other Americans.

Researchers for the Gallup-Healthways Well-Being Index noted that the least happy cities tended to be those with higher obesity rates, and lower exercise rates.

The most miserable also tended to smoke more, earn less money and have a lower level of education.

Boulder was listed as the second happiest place in the U.S., only beaten by the cheery residents of Lincoln, in Nebraska.

On the obesity tables, Charlestown has held its position in 6th place between 2011 and 2012/13 with an obesity rate of 34.6 per cent, up from 33.8 per cent in the last survey.

The surveys were conducted for the annual Gallup-Healthways Well-Being Index, which tracks obesity levels across the country using Americans' Body Mass Index scores.

The indexes are calculated based on a person's self-reported height and weight radio, with scores of 30 or above considered obese.

All seven other places in the most obese table are new, with Haggerstown, Maryland, taking third place, Yakima, Washington, coming in fourth and Little Rock, Arkansas making up the top five.

Gallup attributes this to the state's vast 'outdoor spaces and activities,' that helps promote residents' active lifestyles.

The study found that more than 15 per cent of adults are obese in all but one of the 189 cities surveyed.

It also found that last year, the national obesity rate increased to 27.1 percent, which is the highest on record since the annual surveys began in 2008. In 2010 the government set 15 per cent as the national obesity target.

'Rising obesity rates have significant health consequences,' Janna Lacatell, Healthways Lifestyle Solutions Director said.

'In order to combat the trend and encourage individuals to make healthier choices, community-based policy and environmental approaches can, and should, be used,' she added.

However, other factors could include exposure to sunlight, as last week U.S. researchers revealed that just 20 to 30 minutes of exposure to morning sunshine had an effect on BMIs.

Researchers from Northwestern University believe this is because daylight sets our body-clock, meaning we feel less hungry and use energy more efficiently.

Founded in 1775 as 'Holderby's Landing' by Collis P Huntington, quite a rotund man himself, Huntington (the largest city of the Huntington-Ashland area), was originally a river trading post, cited near where the Guyandotte River and Ohio River join one-another.

It also served as the terminus point for the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway, and its early industry depended heavily on producing steel and manufacturing. The town went into decline after the Second World War, with residents moving away in droves.

America with almost forty per cent of residents registering as obese

Since obesity records started being kept in 2008, the area has featured highly ever single year, coming in third place in 2011, and now topping the table for 2012/13.

As a result Huntington formed the backdrop for ABC's Food Revolution, featuring British chef Jamie Oliver as he tried to persuade American schools to feed children healthier food.

The Huntington area also came first in a table of the most miserable places in the US published last month, with respondents among the most likely in the US to report physical health problems including high blood pressure and high cholesterol.

Nearly one in ten residents has previously had a heart attack. They also reported the lowest levels of emotional health, had lower evaluations of their own lives than any other US city, and were more likely to feel worried or depressed than other Americans.

Just 19 per cent of residents have a college degree, one third of adults smoke, and the average household income is $38,000 a year.
