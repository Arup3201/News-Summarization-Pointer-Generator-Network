Is this Australia's coolest place to work?

The employees at Atlassian seem to think so with the software provider being named the best place to work in the country from a national survey of workers. 

Atlassian's Sydney office comes complete with a drink fridge, beer on tap, table tennis, a pool table, video and board games and a pick 'n' mix station.

But it's not just the fun and games that have earned the company its winning workplace culture vibe. 

New employees are paid to take a holiday before they start at the company, they are given time out to help their chosen charity and executives have an open-mic session with their employees.

Graduates at the company spend a week at the beach with colleagues and all employees have access to a Mood-App' that quickly identifies problems and dissatisfaction. 

The Sydney offices of Atlassian took out the title of best place to work in Australia as part of BRW's annual Best Places To Work list earlier this year.

Great Place To Work Australia surveyed more than 28,000 workers across the country to come up with a list of the top 25 work places with 100 or more employees. 

Atlassian was founded in Australia by university friends Mike Cannon-Brookes and Scott Farquhar 12 years ago.

This year the tech company, which is known for its quirkier style of management, was valued at about $3.3 billion.

They currently employ 900 people in offices across the world and plan to hire 600 more in the next financial year.

Great Place To Work Australia managing director Zrinka Lovrencic told the Financial Review that creating meaning in an employee's work was the strongest trend in people-management.

'That is what Atlassian do a really good job at. Apart from the fact they are really cool and fun... their employees really buy into what they are doing,' she said. 

'Individuals can't create their own meaning. You would be surprised how many organisations we work with outside the study whose senior leadership ask why their employees need to know what the strategy is and what the goals are. They know what job they have to do and that is it.' 

Cannon-Brookes and Farquhar started Atlassian after meeting at the University of New South Wales in 1998 where they were both studying business information technology fresh out of high school.

The co-founders, now 34, still live in Sydney despite having offices in San Francisco, Austin, Amsterdam, Yokohama and Manila.
