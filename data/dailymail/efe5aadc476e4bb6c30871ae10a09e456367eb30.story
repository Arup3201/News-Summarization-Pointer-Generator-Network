The remains of Ned Kelly have been a mystery to Australian's for 136 years but now scientists say they have uncovered the truth of his burial through a major forensic investigation

The missing skull of the infamous Australian bushranger, Ned Kelly, has been a mystery to Australians for 136 years.

It was a question that had been left unanswered until an unidentified skull first emerged in 1979 at the grounds of Old Melbourne Gaol - near where Kelly was buried.

Scientists were convinced that it belonged to the outlaw who was hanged on November 11, 1880 at the prison.

Yet the discovery proved too good to be true, after DNA testings found that the said skull was not in fact Kelly's.

Now scientists have revisited the enigma - this time claiming to have uncovered the secrets behind Kelly's burial and what ultimately became of his skull.

The major forensic investigation has been documented in the book 'Ned Kelly: Under the Microscope' with answers to the unsolved mysteries of one of Australia's most renowned criminals, according to Business Insider.

Through a comprehensive scientific analysis the truths behind Ned Kelly's death and mysterious skull have been revealed by editor Craig Cormick who collaborated contributions from more than 30 experts.

Mr Cormick said the investigation answers what became of his skull, a myth that has been argued for over a century.

'The book explores the science undertaken by researchers at the Victorian Institute of Forensic Medicine, including identifying skeletal remains, analysing DNA samples from Ned Kelly’s blood-soaked possessions and physically matching injuries on bones to known bullet wounds that Ned Kelly sustained,' he said.

Back when the unearthed skull was believed to be Kelly's, it was placed on display at the Old Melbourne Gaol but was stolen in 1978. 

Eventually that same skull was returned in 2009 by Thomas Baxter, a Western Australian farmer.

The investigative book published by CSIRO reveals that skull, also known as the 'Baxter Skull', looks similar to Kelly's head shape but a DNA examination revealed that it did not belong to the Australian bushranger. 

So who is the owner of this skull? And where is Ned Kelly's skull? These questions still remain.

Kelly, who's had Australians debate whether the family man was more of a Robin-Hood character or a notorious criminal, was buried at a mass grave in Pentridge Prison in Victoria.

Another corrupt identity - Frederick Deeming - was said to be buried close to the bushranger, according to the Sydney Morning Herald's Good Weekend magazine.

Deeming, believed to be Australia's first serial killer, was hanged and buried at the prison in 1892 - 12 years after Kelly's death.

Forensic odontologist Dr Richard Bassed told the Good Weekend that he had a 'hunch that the skull belonged to Fred Deeming'.

'His head [from the mask] was the right shape to fit the skull and we did several photo-superimpositions of the death masks,' he said.

'The only ones that fitted were Ned Kelly and Fred Deeming.'

He said because Deeming was buried near Kelly, it is possible that the remains 'could have been mixed up'.

Testings are underway to identify whether the skull is of the serial killer's.

But while DNA samples in 2011 identified the 2008 discovery of bones as Kelly's, his skull remains lost.

Mr Cormick told news.com.au there are three theories that attempt to answer the mystery of Kelly's skull: During an excavation of the Old Melbourne Gaol it was crushed; it has been buried in secret by a senior member of the Catholic clergy; or it was stolen by craniologist Archibald Hamiliton.
