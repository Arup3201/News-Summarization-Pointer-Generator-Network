Superfan: Mother-of-one Jayne Bailey, 47, has 20 tattoos dedicated to her favourite band - One Direction

She might be four times the average age of a typical One Direction fan, but that hasn't stopped 47-year-old Jayne Bailey from covering her body with 20 tattoos dedicated to the band.

The mother-of-one, from Wolverhampton, West Midlands, has been following One Direction since they were on the X Factor in 2010.

And her obsession with the five teenage band members - Liam Payne, Niall Horan, Zayn Malik, Harry Styles and Louis Tomlinson - has only increased.

The former pub manager now has 20 One Direction tattoos across her arms and chest - and even a comedy moustache on her index finger.

She has an identical replica of Harry Style's tattoo of two swallows on his chest and Louis Tomlinson's stag on her arm and has each member's date of birth and their signatures inked on to her body.

Ms Bailey has spent £350 so far on the inkings and 10 hours under the needle but has vowed she still wants more.

Her latest tattoo is dedicated to the boys' film 'This Is Us' released last month.

Ms Bailey's 13-year-old daughter Aisling is also a One Direction fan and the pair have covered their home with One Direction posters.

But Ms Bailey admits she sometimes does get criticism for her obsession with the band.

Ms Bailey, who is 28-years-older than Harry Styles, said: 'I love the band. I think they're great, it's something me and my daughter can do together

'People stare but I just get used to it. I've had abuse on Twitter - even from 13 and 14 year old girls.

They say things like: "They will think you're stupid, they'll hate you".

'But I'm mature enough to know whether or not I want a tattoo. I had two before I got the 1D logo tattooed on my wrist.

'Some people look at me strangely but the people that know me, know that it's who I am. I'll be devastated if they break up, but I'm old enough to know what I'm getting myself into.'

Ms Bailey got her first One Direction tattoo last April and her collection has grown from there.

Her aim is to get more tattoos and turn her One Direction montage into a full sleeve.

She said: 'I do want more but I'm a single mum, so often it's a choice between a tattoo and shopping - and we need to eat.

'I only watched the X Factor to support Liam because his parents drink in my local pub.

'But I got hooked. When Liam came in for a drink over Christmas it made our year. He signed a hoody for my daughter and a £10 note for me. He turned my £10 note into a million pounds. I have it framed.'

Ms Bailey has even joined her daughter camping outside venues to get tickets for concerts.

She said: 'We camped outside the Civic Hall in Wolverhampton for a night and managed to get front row tickets so it was definitely worth it.

'Then we spent two nights in a tent for the tickets for the LG Arena in Birmingham.

'Aisling's dad used to drop us off and we'd put up the tent and be fine. We actually made some really good friends that way.'
