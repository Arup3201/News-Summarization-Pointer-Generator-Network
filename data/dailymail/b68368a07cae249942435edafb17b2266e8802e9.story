British taxpayers are forking out almost £1million a year for pregnant Polish women to go home and give birth in their native country, it emerged yesterday.

Under European Union rules, set up to provide emergency healthcare between member states, hundreds of Polish women are returning to their families to have their children, with the NHS picking up the bill.

Last year around 500 Poles living in the UK went back to their native land to give birth.

Given that the average cost to the NHS
 per birth is £1,631, Polish births alone cost the British taxpayer 
around £850,000 in 2012.

The situation has become more acute 
following the influx of immigrants into the UK from Eastern Europe over 
the past decade. Under EU regulations, anyone who comes to Britain to 
earn a living can fill in an S2 or E112 form, which entitles them to 
free treatment in any other member state or Switzerland.

The same applies to British women living in a European state.

Latest figures reveal that there were 
1,132 cases last year where Britain paid for treatment in European 
Economic Area countries or Switzerland. Some 995 cases, or around 90 per
 cent, related to maternity care.

Of these, 519 were for treatment in 
Polish hospitals, with 174 cases in France and 90 in Germany. There were
 74 cases in Slovakia, 49 in the Czech Republic and 21 in Hungary.

Romanian hospitals claimed for 18, Lithuania for 12, four from Bulgaria and one claim from Latvia.

The figures are more than double that of 2010 when just 442 of the 1,498 cases related to maternity care.

Gerard Batten, UKIP spokesman on home 
affairs, said: ‘This is yet another example of how membership of the EU 
means the UK public purse is being plundered. People fleece us for 
whatever they can get. Unfortunately all these things are totally legal.
 We can only put a stop to it by leaving the EU.’

To obtain an E112 form, an NHS consultant must first agree that treatment abroad is right for the patient.

The patient must also gain approval from the local health authority and the Department of Health.

Patients are treated under the same 
care conditions as residents of the country they go to. In nations where
 state healthcare is not free, the patient may have to pay a percentage 
of the cost.

Tory MP Chris Skidmore said: ‘When this scheme was set up it was meant to cover for emergency treatment.

‘This particular EU area should be renegotiated when the Prime Minister sets out a repatriation of powers.’

A Department of Health spokesman said:
 ‘Under EU rules, anyone working and paying tax where they are living, 
including Britons living abroad, can request treatment in another EU 
country.

‘This is particularly common in maternity cases where some people prefer to be around family and friends.’

E112 form means NHS pays for those who pay tax in UK to go abroad

We would like to make clear that the cost of £1m has been calculated on the assumption that the cost billed to the NHS of a birth in Poland under the E112/S2 scheme is the same or similar to the average cost of a birth in the UK which is £1,631
