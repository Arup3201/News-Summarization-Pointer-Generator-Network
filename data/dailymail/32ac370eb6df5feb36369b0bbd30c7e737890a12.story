Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard’s future looks increasingly uncertain as discussions over a new contract drag on.

Fears are growing at Anfield that the Kop legend’s career at the club is drawing to a close, with the American owners unwilling to match the 34-year-old’s current £140,000-per-week contract. The former England captain’s deal expires in the summer, when he could leave on a free transfer.

Gerrard came on as a 75th-minute substitute in Saturday’s 1-0 win over Stoke City, the 16th anniversary of his debut. He is believed to be open to offers from January when he can hold talks with overseas clubs. A cut in wages is likely to be a significant factor in whether Liverpool and Gerrard can agree fresh terms.

Liverpool are in the middle of a contract renewal drive to tie down a clutch of their stars. Jordan Henderson has been offered a new five-year deal worth £80,000-per-week, but has yet to put pen to paper.

The club have also opened talks with starlet Raheem Sterling, who said last week he expects to sign an improved deal. Glen Johnson, yesterday’s goalscorer, has been offered a two-year deal but is believed to be reluctant to agree terms worth only half of his current £120,000-per-week contract.

Manager Brendan Rodgers admits no announcement over Gerrard is imminent. ‘There’s no update I am aware of. I think the club is talking with Steven’s representatives,’ he said.

Rodgers added that he had not been aware of the significance of the date when he decided to rest Gerrard, who was told of the plan on Friday.

‘I wasn’t aware it was 16 years until I walked into the dressing room and saw the programme,’ said the manager. ‘I spoke to him yesterday and he didn’t mention it. I felt bad when I saw the programme and saw about 20 pictures!

‘He’s been brilliant for me here but Steven’s in a part of his career when he is not going to play every minute of every game.

‘We have good players that are fresh. But he came on and made a great contribution.’
