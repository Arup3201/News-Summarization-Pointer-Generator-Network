She was the quintessential perfect nanny who every child dreamed of floating into their lives under her magical black umbrella.

Now a real Mary Poppins has emerged in the form of Brenda Ashford, a 92-year-old nanny who has cared for over 100 children over her 62 year career.

Speaking on This Morning she described being a nanny as ‘a calling rather an occupation’ she attended the prestigious Norland Nanny School.

One of six children, Brenda says her love of children says started at age 9 when her little brother was born.

Brenda Ashford appeared with her surrogate daughter Susanna, who she cared for from 10 days old

At an impressive age of 92, Brenda has cared for over 100 children in her 62 year career

‘I just adored babies, and my youngest brother was a special baby to me because I was able to do things for him.

‘I used to help my mother with him and do things like put him in my doll pram and push him around.’

She attended the Norland College when she was 18, inspired, she says, by her own mother, who had wanted to be a nanny.

‘Mother had 6 of us in 10 years. She wanted to be a Norland nanny but at the time it wasn’t considered quite the ‘right thing’ and her father did not want her to be a nanny.

Brenda talks of how at Norland College, as well as learning all about childcare, the student nannies first did 3 months of training in domestic work.

‘We learnt everything from cleaning shoes to cleaning lavatories.’

Brenda appeared on This Morning to discuss her new book 'Tuppence for Paper and String' which chronicles Brenda's experiences

Susanna says that Brenda helped to shape her into the woman she has become, and brought her in to help care for her own children

Her love of her job means she has 
never married or had children herself, but many of the children she 
cared for have become surrogate children to her.

Appearing
with her as she spoke on This Morning to talk about her new book 
Tuppence for Paper & String, was one of her many former charges 
Suzanna Morris.

Brenda cared for Suzanna from the age of 10 days old, and remained with the family for 15 years.

Suzanna,
who calls Brenda ‘Nana’ spoke of her me memories of her, and said 
Brenda has helped to shape her into the woman she is today.

Mary Poppins, famously played by Julie Andrews, was the quintessential perfect nanny who every child dreamed of floating into their lives

Describing why Brenda was such a 
special nanny Suzanna says: ‘She knew everything, she was always there 
and it was always very calm.

‘You knew that she loved you completely and utterly.’

Their bond is so strong that when Suzanna had her own children, Brenda, became their nanny.

Speaking about how parenting styles 
have changed from her early days she says although there is much more 
leniency these days, mothering has because more active.

‘More mothers are more hands on now.

‘When I started my train, a lot of 
mothers, before they got married, hadn’t had anything to do with 
children and knew very little about what to do.

‘It was just me there  to help  them for the first 6 weeks.’

However Brenda doesn’t think that all changes in child rearing has been positive, saying she disagrees with the current trend of sending children to a ‘naughty step’ when they misbehave.

‘I don’t like the naughty step, I think they get more attention that way.

‘My theory would be I send them up to their room until they are ready to come down and apologise.

‘Then when they do it’s important to get down to their level and explain it to them.’

‘And love. Smiling and love I think are the most important things.’Tuppence for Paper and String chronicles Brenda’s experiences of 62 years of nannying, and is her second book.
