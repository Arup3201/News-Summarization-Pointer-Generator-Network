NHS hospitals are becoming ‘dangerously’ overcrowded and staff do not have enough time to clean-up between patients, experts warn.

Some wards are more than 95 per cent full - well over the 85 per cent considered safe – placing patients at far higher risk of infections and neglect.

A report by the Kings Fund today also warns that standards across the NHS including hitting waiting times and financial targets have slipped for the first time in 20 years.

NHS hospitals are becoming ‘dangerously’ overcrowded and targets for waiting times are slipping, experts warn

The think-tank predicts there is a ‘real risk’ patient care will worsen next year because the health service is running out of money. 

Its experts are particularly concerned that many hospitals are becoming so overcrowded their wards are unsafe.

Figures show that the average NHS hospital is 90 per cent full but in the last three months to December almost a fifth were more than 95 per cent occupied.

This is partly because many hospitals have lost beds and closed wards as part of a long-term drive to treat more patients at home.

John Appleby, chief economist at the Kings Fund, called the report 'worrying'

The numbers of beds has halved in 26 years from around 300,000 in 1987/8 to 150,000 last year.

But over that time, the numbers of frail patients being admitted to hospital from A&E has increased and they are being packed onto crowded wards where there is a high turnover.

John Appleby, chief economist at the Kings Fund said: ‘That is very worrying.’

‘There is clearly pressure in the system to use beds more intensively as the money is tighter, but patients keep turning up at the front door.

‘If they are used too intensively you haven’t got time to clean up between patients.

‘The pressure is building and bubbling out in terms of bed occupancy levels which are getting dangerously high.’

‘There are potential dangers with infections and not having enough time to clean beds.’

The report also warns that targets for waiting times in A&E, cancer treatment and other operations and procedures have been repeatedly missed over the last year.

And it predicts the waits may well get even longer next year as hospitals just do not have enough money to ensure patients are treated promptly.

The NHS will have overspent its budget by more than £800 million by the end of this financial year and half of hospitals will be in the red.

Mr Appleby added: ‘The next Government will inherit a health service that has run out of money and is operating at the very edge of its limits.

‘While the NHS has performed well in the face of huge challenges, there is now a real risk that patient care will deteriorate as service and financial pressures become overwhelming.

Andy Burnham MP, Labour's Shadow Health Secretary, said the report was proof that David Cameron had ‘broken’ his promise to protect the NHS

‘Our assessment is it's going to be very difficult indeed next year.

‘My speculation would be that once the system is under pressure financially next year as well, we're going to see some real problems with waiting times and that's going to have to be addressed, and patients will really feel that.

Andy Burnham MP, Labour's Shadow Health Secretary, said the report was proof that David Cameron had ‘broken’ his promise to protect the NHS.

‘What this report reveals, is that he is on course to create a large deficit in the NHS.

‘Hospitals are now trapped in a financial vicious circle with bills for agency staff running out of control and staff failing to keep pace with demand.’  

Clive Turner, 74  died last year after waiting five hours for an ambulance only to be misdiagnosed at hospital

Lilly Baxandall, 95, died after waiting four hours in a queue of ambulances at Glan Clwyd Hospital, North Wales.

A coroners hearing was told Miss Baxandall’s cleaner dialled 999 on September 1 last year when she found her on the floor after a fall. She had a cut on her head but was still conscious.

Paramedics arrived soon after and she was transported to hospital in an ambulance two hours later.

But Coroner John Gittins said, there was evidence to suggest 11 ambulances were queuing outside A&E waiting to discharge patients.

‘Over the course of the next few hours she began to decline and paramedics were becoming concerned at the delay in admission,’ he said.

By the time she was finally admitted to the Bodelwyddan hospital, four hours later, her family said it was too late.

A post-mortem examination found she died of pneumonia due to bleeding on the brain, caused by the head injury.  

The coroner also referred to the death of Clive Turner, 73. In March 2014, retired engineer Mr Turner called an ambulance after  suffering internal bleeding. 

But it was five hours before he was admitted to hospital where he was then misdiagnosed. He died the following day.
