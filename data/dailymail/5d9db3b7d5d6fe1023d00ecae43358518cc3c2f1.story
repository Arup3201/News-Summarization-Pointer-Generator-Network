Candid photographs of Anzac troops at Gallipoli have captured moments which reflect true experiences of war.

The Australian War Memorial has released 39 images as part of a travelling exhibition to commemorate the centenary of the First World War.

The photos were taken by leading Melbourne surgeon Sir Charles Ryan while he was serving with the Australian Imperial Force in Turkey in 1915.

The exhibition - A Camera on Gallipoli - shows the reality behind the 1915 Gallipoli campaign, director of the Australian War Memorial Dr Brendan Nelson said.

'In 1914, at the age of 61, Sir Charles Ryan was appointed consulting surgeon to the AIF, embarking from Melbourne in October for the Middle East and on to Gallipoli,' he said.

'Sir Charles Ryanâ€™s photographs reflect the Australians' true experience of war, depicting the dry, forbidding landscape, tired troops in the trenches, and squalid dugouts.'

But while the images illustrate the realities of war, Dr Nelson says the photos also portray 'true spirit of the Australian soldiers who fought at Gallipoli'.

'Their mateship, stoicism and endurance underpin the photographs and embody the meaning of the Anzac spirit,' he said.

Dr Ryan served as a doctor with the Turkish army in 1877 to 1878, treated Ned Kelly at Glenrowan - north-east of Melbourne - and gave long service as a senior military officer, Dr Nelson said.

'He was extended high civil and military recognition by his peers,' Dr Nelson said.

The photos will be displayed in three formats: a framed exhibition, a pop-up banner exhibition and a digital exhibition.

They will be travelling across NSW from August to October.
