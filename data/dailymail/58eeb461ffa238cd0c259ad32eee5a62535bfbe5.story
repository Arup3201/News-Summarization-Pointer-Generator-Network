A man who murdered his estranged wife by cutting her throat when she refused to go for a drink with him has been jailed for life.

Robert Tiffin, 46, pleaded guilty to stabbing and slashing Lisa Banks 27 times in the North Shields barber shop where she worked.

Newcastle Crown Court heard how the 46-year-old mother-of-two had already left Tiffin after growing tired of his violent and controlling behaviour, including a recent threat to behead her.

Murder: Robert Tiffin pleaded guilty to stabbing and slashing Lisa Banks 27 times in the North Shields barber shop where she worked. The 46-year-old mother-of-two had already left Tiffin over his violent behaviour

The court heard how, after Ms Banks refused to go for a drink with her husband, he waited until she was alone in the Sole'O barber shop on Nile Street in North Shields, before carrying out a frenzied knife attack.

He left a trail of blood leading from the barber shop to his flat over the road, from where he would regularly watch Ms Banks while she worked.

Prosecutors claim Tiffin attempted to carry out his threat to behead Ms Banks during the attack, as she suffered multiple wounds to her neck.

After the murder he stole from Ms Banks' body and then met a friend for a drink.

Tiffin, who muttered obscenities at Ms Banks' grieving family and complained they were looking at him in court, was jailed for life with a minimum of 24 years.

Judge James Goss QC told Tiffin: 'It was a savage and sustained attack and you subjected her to pain and suffering before her death.

'No sentence of this court can undo or compensate for the loss you have caused.

'Not only has a good life been horrifically cut short but those left behind will suffer that loss for the rest of their lives.”

Ms Banks, who was expecting her first grandchild at the time of her murder, met Tiffin in 2011 and they were married within months.

Her family disapproved of the relationship, however, and tried to persuade her to leave him, the court was told.

Eventually Ms Banks did move out of their flat on Nile Street, North Shields, and went to live with her daughter nearby.

But Tiffin continued to bother her, with Ms Banks telling her family that retained contact in order to keep the peace.

The court heard how, on September 7 last year, Tiffin waited for Ms Banks' employer to leave the shop before attacking her.

It is thought he may have used a kitchen knife from his flat to brutally murder his wife, with most of the wounds inflicted while she was lying on the ground.

She had 11 slashes to her neck and head, two stab wounds to her chest and 14 to her arms.

Nicholas Lumley QC, prosecuting, said the owner of the barbers, Bruce Jeffrey, found Ms Banks' body the next day.

He said: 'There she was lying in the staff room, very obviously dead...The hot tap was running and there was a trail of blood leading from the shop to Tiffin’s flat.'

Prosecutors said Tiffin went back to the murder scene afterwards, stealing Ms Banks' £130 wages and jewellery.

After the murder Tiffin tried to pay for a bus fare to Newcastle with a blood-soaked £5 note, before visiting a former parter in Whitley Bay and then going drinking. He was arrested the next day.
