A suburban Los Angeles school district has paid a private firm to monitor its students' social media activities.

The Glendale Unified School District last year hired the firm Geo Listening to snoop the social media postings of the 14,000 or so students in the area to screen for any signs of bullying, self-harm, drug-use or violence, at a cost of $40,500.

Critics believe the screening sets a dangerous precedent and stifles free speech, but school district authorities and Geo Listening say the purpose of the exercise is student safety.

Geo Listening provides Glendale district officials with a daily report based on students' post from social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Tumblr and YouTube.

The firm's analysts search for terms that indicate violence, drug-use, 
bullying, self-harm or suicidal thoughts, racism and sexual harassment and alert the school district to anything untoward.

However, the firm does not engage in hacking or tracking private correspondence, only monitoring public posts and comments.

'All of the individual posts we monitor on social media networks are already made public by the students themselves. Therefore, no privacy is violated,' a Geo Listening spokesperson told RT, adding that the company does not 'monitor email, SMS, MMS, phone calls, voicemails or unlock any privacy setting of a social network user.'

Geo Listening CEO Chris Frydrych says his firm was not given a list 
of children's names, but the firm doesn't disclose how the company deduces whether 
teens are students of the Glendale district.

Frydrych told CNN that the way kids communicate is different nowadays, and 
that the firm doesn't spy on kids, but rather listens more effectively.

Two area students committed suicide last school year, including a 15-year-old from Crescenta Valley High School in the Glendale District.

Following the tragic deaths, the Glendale Unified School District hired Geo Listening for a pilot monitoring program of students from its three high schools, Glendale, Hoover and Crescenta Valley.

According to Frydrych, the pilot program helped prevent the suicide of a student after the company alerted the district to worrying posts on social media, resulting in an intervention.

Following that success, the district contracted the firm for a full year.

'We think it's been working very well,' Superintendent Richard Sheehan told the Los Angeles Times.

'It's designed around student safety and making sure kids are protected.'

High school spies: According to Geo Listening, students' privacy is not invaded by the practice of social media monitoring, but some students disagree

Students were unaware their social media accounts were being spied on until media reports of the practice emerged.

Herbert Hoover High student Christopher Chung told the Los Angeles Times that he found out about the monitoring program on Facebook.

'I heard rumors that GUSD was doing a little bit of monitoring - but nothing as official as this,' he said.

'The only way students were finding out about it was through social media. Our principal hasn't said anything about it.'

Free speech advocates say school districts reading students' social media posts is an invasion of the students' privacy - especially if they're punished for activities engaged in outside of school hours.

Lee Tien, senior staff attorney for the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a nonprofit that defends privacy, free speech and consumer rights. told the Los Angeles Times the program is essentially 'stalking' school kids.

'People say that's not private: It's public on Facebook. I say that's just semantics. The question is what is the school doing? It's not stumbling into students - like a teacher running across a student on the street. This is the school sending someone to watch them.'

Communication skills: Teens do a lot of their communicating online these days - which is why the Glendale district says it's necessary to monitor what students are saying on social media

The response from Glendale district students themselves are mixed. Some feel anything that helps prevent bullying is a good thing.

Others expressed outrage that the district spent money on a monitoring program when other areas need funding.

'GUSD instead of paying 40k to stalk students uh can't y'all spend it on things that matter like SOAP for the bathrooms and quality food,' tweeted one.

Another Twitter user said, 'GUSD payin 40,500 for monitoring but we have like the worst campus, no class set textbooks, AND TEACHERS HAVE US PRINT OUT OUR OWN PAPERS?'

Superintendent Sheehan will make an appearance at the school district's PTA meeting later this month to discuss the program with parents and address any concerns.
