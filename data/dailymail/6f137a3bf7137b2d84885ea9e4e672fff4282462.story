He has been looking for love online since splitting from Good Morning Britain presenter Susanna Reid.

And it appears Dominic Cotton’s search may have come to an end.

The 46-year-old was spotted outside his home with mother-of-two Adela Straughan, just days after Miss Reid left the house to go on holiday.

Romance: Susanna Reid's ex-husband Dominic Cotton was seen with new girlfriend Adela Straughan this week

Miss Straughan, 43, joined Mr Cotton on Saturday, and they were also seen together later in the week.

Miss Straughan, who is in the process of divorcing her husband, and Mr Cotton appeared to be going on an afternoon jaunt as they loaded up his car with padded jackets and bags last Sunday. An onlooker saw them kiss before heading off to their destination. 

Yesterday Mr Cotton said Miss Reid, 43, was aware that he was in a new relationship – admitting it was ‘odd’ because they still live under the same roof in South London. 

The pair, who have three sons, were together for 15 years before parting earlier this year in February in what was dubbed the ‘curse of Strictly’ as it came just after her appearance on the BBC show which has seen numerous couples split. 

He said: ‘Susanna knows I’ve got a girlfriend. This is an odd situation living together, but we get on really well.’

Mr Cotton then set up a profile on dating website Match.com in which he said he was looking for a woman aged 35 to 45 and added: ‘Underneath my blokeish exterior I am a sensitive soul.

‘I enjoy sharing things and am someone who doesn’t shy away from commitment. Life is for living with someone special.’

Things aren’t so bright for Miss Reid this week. Viewing figures for her ITV breakfast show are down 13 per cent on the same slot last year.
