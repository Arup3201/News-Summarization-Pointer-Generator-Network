Benefits claimants who cannot speak and write English will be ordered to take language classes or have their handouts stopped for up to three years.

The measure, announced by the Prime Minister and Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith, is expected to apply to about 67,000 people on Jobseeker’s Allowance.  It is designed to target a hardcore of claimants whose language skills are so poor they have little or no chance of ever being offered a job and are doing nothing to improve their skills themselves.

But despite David Cameron’s stance, cynics are likely to suggest the measures will join a raft of tough-talking announcements that lose their teeth in practice.

Under the plans, anyone who refuses 
to start an English course or fails to turn up to classes will face a 
sliding scale of sanctions.

Most of the group of 67,000 claimants
are immigrants with a right to work in this country, but a significant 
number are British-born people whose education has been so dire they are
barely able to communicate.

However, Government officials themselves admit they expect the sanctions to be little used.

Many claimants, they say, are often 
keen to take up the offer of free  language classes, while even those 
who are not are expected to be motivated by the threat of having their 
benefits stopped.

Speaking on a visit to Brixton, South
London, Mr Cameron said: ‘We are getting rid of the old idea that you 
can get your welfare without conditions being put on that.

‘We’re saying that if there’s 
something you need to help you get a job, for instance being able to 
speak  English and learn English properly, it should be a requirement 
that you do that study in order for you to receive your benefits.

‘That’s good for you because it’s 
going to help you get a job, it’s good for the taxpayer because we won’t
be wasting money on welfare that’s unnecessary, and it’s good for the 
economy because we want more people in work creating a bigger, more 
productive economy.’

Jobcentre Plus advisers will be able 
to mandate people to take part in training courses if they judge they 
lack the correct skills to get the jobs on offer in the local labour 
market.

People with poor English skills, 
which are preventing them from getting into employment, will be referred
to English language training courses run by local colleges and funded 
by the Department for Business.

If claimants refuse or fail to attend
any of the classes recommended to them, they will have their 
Jobseeker’s Allowance stopped for three months.

A second offence will mean benefits being withdrawn for six months and a third three years.

The measure extends ‘conditionality’ in the welfare system, meaning conditions are attached to receiving handouts.

In a similar example of this, Mr 
Cameron has asked the Government’s social policy review, announced in 
the wake of last month’s riots, to look into whether the parents of 
children who constantly play truant  should have their benefits cut.

Speaking as the Welfare Reform Bill 
was debated in the House of Lords, Mr Duncan Smith also announced that 
benefit claimants will receive their money in monthly payments under the
Coalition’s new Universal Credit system, which will replace a host of 
out-of-work benefits.

Since 75 per cent of people who work 
are paid monthly, Mr Duncan Smith said it was only sensible  benefits 
are paid in the same manner, to help claimants get used to managing 
their money and bills on a  four-week basis to smooth the transition 
into work.

‘People get benefits on a fortnightly basis, yet most people in work are paid monthly,’ the Work and Pensions Secretary said.

‘This change can cause anxiety and dissuade people on benefits from entering the workplace.
