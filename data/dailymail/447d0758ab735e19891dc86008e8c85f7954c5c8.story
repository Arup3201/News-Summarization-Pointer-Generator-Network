The lawyer for one of James Bulger's murderers today revealed the 'living nightmare' of representing the notorious child killer.

Speaking ahead of the 20th anniversary of the toddler's death, Laurence Lee recalled how he was convinced that 'angelic-looking' Jon Venables must be innocent of the brutal crime.

He also claimed that were it not for the malign influence of Robert Thompson, whom he compared to 'the Pied Piper', Venables would never have taken part in the killing.

The 10-year-old was on his way to school to pick up some gerbils which his teacher had asked him to look after, but was apparently led astray by Thompson telling him: 'Forget the gerbils, let's go robbing.'

Mr Lee represented Venables, now one of the most notorious criminals in Britain, from the moment the boy was arrested on February 18, 1993.

He and Thompson had been caught on CCTV six days earlier holding two-year-old James by the hand and leading him through the Strand shopping centre in Bootle, near Liverpool.

Over the following hours, they beat and tortured him before leaving him for dead on a nearby railway line.

But Mr Lee said today that in his first meeting with his client, he found it impossible to believe that he could be guilty.

'He was like an angelic-looking eight-year-old,' said the solicitor, who now runs his own law firm in Liverpool.

'I thought, "What am I doing here? He couldn’t be capable of anything like this." He was so convincing in his first interview that he had been nowhere near the Strand.'

Venables claimed that he had been near Goodison Park with Thompson, and said neither of them had been at the shopping centre where the toddler went missing.

Mr Lee, 59, said: 'I believed him. He was convincing. And it was only after there was a time-out and the officers who interviewed Thompson had a briefing and came back for the second interview.

'And again I was in blissful ignorance thinking, it’s the easiest money - I felt guilty, actually, because this boy had had nothing to do with anything, I thought - until having got him cosy with his little space pens and his can of Coke, they kept him nice and relaxed and they said: "Look we’ve spoken to Robert and he says you were in the Strand."'

After a silence Venables responded: 'Well OK, we were in the Strand but we never grabbed a kid.'

Mr Lee said: 'He got up and he grabbed his mum and he was crying and I thought, "Oh my God, what have I let myself in for here?"

'The walls came crashing in at that moment and I knew what he was like, and it was like a living nightmare.'

He said that from that point he was 'caught up in a maelstrom of massive criminology' which he could never have prepared for, and described how police had to check his car to ensure he was not targeted by vigilantes in a reprisal attack.

'I had never been in this position before,' he said. 'I thought I was going to get assassinated or something at first because the public’s feelings - including my own - were running high.'

Mr Lee sympathised with Venables' parents, whom he described as 'very respectable people', saying that the boy's upbringing was 'no worse than any kid in Liverpool'.

He put the blame for the murder squarely on the shoulders of the other 10-year-old: 'Thompson had this kind of hold. He was like the Pied Piper.'

According to Mr Lee, Venables had been asked by his teacher to look after the class pets: 'He was on his way to pick up the gerbils from the school, and it was only because he bumped into Thompson who said, "Forget the gerbils, let's go robbing".'

The lawyer criticised officials for choosing to hold the children's trial in the main courtroom at Preston Crown Court, saying: 'They couldn’t have found a more daunting venue than Court One at Preston. It is scary.'

However, Mr Lee also expressed sympathy for the Bulgers, and said he would have been willing to prosecute Venables and Thompson.

'My number one sentiment is for Denise [James’s mother] - still is and always will be,' he said. 'The wounds re-open for that lady every time this comes up and now must be horrendous for her.'

The solicitor has not seen Venables since 1994, and said he was shocked to hear that his client had been jailed again in 2010 for downloading child pornography, while Thompson had managed to stay 'under the radar'.

'Venables couldn’t handle being out,' he said. 'He was always looking over his shoulder. They may be at liberty but they will never be free.'

Peter Kilfoyle, who was MP for the area where James was killed, has used the 20th anniversary of the case to call for new measures to deal with children who commit serious crimes.

'I think people would have been more prepared for an older person being held responsible for James’s murder,' he said.

'The fact that the perpetrators were also young children, for so many people that blew their minds. They couldn’t understand how this could happen.'

The 66-year-old Labour politician added: 'What we didn’t have, and I’m not sure if we have them today, are the appropriate facilities to deal with these exceptional circumstances.

'Admittedly a small cohort of youngsters, who commit terrible crimes or have got horrendous problems. I don’t think that we have worked out properly how we deal with these children.'

James's father Ralph Bulger is releasing a new book called My James, in which he reveals how in his darkest moments he blamed then wife Denise for letting their son get out of her sight.

He also speaks about how he downed two bottles of whisky a day to blot out the pain, and how he considered suicide in the wake of the tragedy.
