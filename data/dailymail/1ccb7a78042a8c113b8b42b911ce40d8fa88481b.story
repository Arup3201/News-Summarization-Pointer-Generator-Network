The biopic about the most lethal sniper in American history was right on the money, earning more during its opening day Friday than any Eastwood flick has in an entire weekend, the studio reported.

'American Sniper,' which stars Bradley Cooper in the role of US Navy SEAL sniper Chris Kyle, drew $30.5million in Friday box office receipts, according to Deadline.

That take has already ensured the movie will have the best opening weekend of any Clint Eastwood movie to date, his previous best being Gran Torino, which took in $29.5million.

On Thursday, it was announced the film was up for six Oscar nominations, which included one for best actor for Cooper and one for best adapted screenplay.

Eastwood took on the directing role of 'American Sniper' shortly after Steven Spielberg and DreamWorks pulled out of the project in 2013.

A distant second was Sony's 'The Wedding Ringer,' which brought in $7million according to the studio's estimates.
