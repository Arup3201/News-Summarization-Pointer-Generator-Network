School-leavers are damaging their career chances by spending too long fiddling with their smartphones and making social calls at work, a survey of firms has revealed.

They are leaving bosses unimpressed because they often display poor attitudes to work including using their phones while on the job.

Employers are also concerned that new recruits are taking long lunch and coffee breaks and failing to turn up for work on time.

The poll is the latest in a spate of studies to question the skills and suitability of school-leavers to start work.

The CBI warned earlier this year that economic prosperity is being put at risk because large numbers of teenagers are leaving school and college ‘underequipped for life’.

The latest survey – covering 500 small and medium-sized businesses - showed that many employers believe youngsters have little idea how to behave appropriately at work.

More than four in 10 – 43 per cent – were worried about young recruits using their mobile phone while at work or taking too long on their breaks.

A similar proportion – 41 per cent – believed young people lacked time management and punctuality skills.

It also emerged that 55 per cent of employers felt school-leavers lacked relationship skills, leaving unable to handle clients, customers and suppliers.

The survey – by the LifeSkills programme aimed at boosting youth employability - concluded that ‘young people at entry level lack a range of basic skills when they start work’.

Following the research, LifeSkills today demanded a greater focus in schools on preparing children for the world of work.

It made a series of proposals to ministers including long-term tracking of school-leavers to monitor their success in the workplace.

It said programmes such as LifeSkills, which offers web resources and lesson plans and facilitates work experience to smooth pupils’ transition to work, helped youngsters with skills such as handling new people and situations confidently and conveying their strengths to others.

Kirstie Mackey, head of LifeSkills at Barclays, which supports the programme, said: ‘Small and medium sized businesses are an incredibly important source of employment, yet this research shows they perceive a disconnect between the skills they need and those of young people at entry level.’

Standards in schools and universities are a recurring concern among business leaders, several of whom have publicly aired their views.

Sir Terry Leahy (above), then chief executive of Tesco, lamented that standards were ‘still woefully low in too many schools’ and that companies were ‘often left to pick up the pieces’

Sir Terry Leahy, then chief executive of Tesco, lamented that standards were ‘still woefully low in too many schools’ and that companies were ‘often left to pick up the pieces’.

Meanwhile Sir Stuart Rose, the former Marks and Spencer boss, said too many school-leavers struggled with reading, writing and arithmetic.

The CBI report earlier this year found that standards of basic skills among young staff are so poor that more than a quarter of companies now run their own remedial training courses in the three-Rs.

The study, carried out jointly with the publisher Pearson, said that ‘too many young people leave school underequipped for life’ outside the classroom.

Almost three-quarters of businesses criticised school leavers’ ‘business and customer awareness’, while 61 per cent said they had poor ‘self-management and resilience’.

More than half cited concerns over communication skills, 50 per cent criticised a lack of problem-solving skills, 38 per cent said students struggled with basic numeracy and 36 per cent claimed ‘basic literacy and use of English’ was a problem.
