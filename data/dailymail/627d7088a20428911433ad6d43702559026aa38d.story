The gummy party python weighs in at 27lbs

We all like to tuck into a sugary treat every now and then. But an American retailer has launched the ultimate snack for those with a sssweet tooth.

Manufacturers Vat19 claim that this 27lb monster - known as the 'gummy party python' will kill you if you attempt to eat it in one sitting.

And at a staggering 36,000 calories per snake - or nearly 18-and-a-half times an adult's recommended daily calorie intake - it's hardly surprising that you'll get more than a sugar rush if you choose to part with the $150 price tag.

Vat19's website says: 'Actually, you probably couldn't ingest 26lbs of candy, if you did your stomach would probably burst.'

Slithering in at almost eight feet long, this slippery snack is described as 'as ridiculous as candy can get'.

The giant sweet contains 27lb of sugar - more than a dozen bags of sugar - but makers of the candy say that it can be kept for up to a year as long as it is kept out of direct sunlight and extreme heat.

It's recommends that the treat is to be shared, or eaten alone in 306 separate sugary servings.

The hand-made treat comes in two flavours, either blue raspberry with green apple or red cherry.Â 

Generously described as the Lamborghini of the sweet world, the gummy party python has proved a hit already, with the website currently out of stock.

Manufacturers claim that it has lifelike details including including intricate eyes, blended colouring, ridged coils, and thousands of individually carved scales.

Vat19 appears to be no stranger to producing oversized candy - the company also produces the world's largest gummy bear, which at 5lb is the equivalent of 1,400 regular bears and the largest gummy worm, which is a whopping 4,000 calories.

The company also produces a giant gummy cola bottle which is 90 times the size of a regular sweet.

The snake is not the biggest sweet treat ever produced.

A 9,702lb chocolate bar was put on display in the Armenian capital Yerevan back in 2010.
