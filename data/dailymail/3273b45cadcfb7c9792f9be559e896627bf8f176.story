A man battered his ex-girlfriend to death with a rolling pin to ensure he had custody of their baby girl, a court heard yesterday.

Jilted Adam Singer, 30, is said to have stolen the murder weapon from his work as a galley assistant on a Royal Navy base.

The prosecution claims he then used it to launch a 'cold blooded and extremely brutal attack' on Sally Ann Harrison, 24.

Adam Singer, 30, has gone on trial accused of beating his ex-girlfriend Sally Ann Harrison (pictured) to death with a rolling pin after she threatened to move out of their home and take their daughter Isabella with her

She suffered fatal head injuries during the onslaught in their maisonette in Devonport, Devon which they shared despite no longer being a couple.

Bristol Crown Court heard that Singer ‘rehearsed’ the killing, asking workmates at the HMS Drake base if they thought a rolling pin would kill and whether it would be better to hit someone on the side or top of the head.

Court heard that Singer 'rehearsed' the killing at the galley kitchen where he worked, asking colleagues whether a blow from a rolling pin could kill

Simon Laws, QC, prosecuting, told how Singer was determined to ‘get his way’ after the couple split following a five-and-a-half year relationship.

They continued living with each other despite finding new partners but Sally was planning to leave, taking their 21-month-old daughter Isabella with her.

Mr. Laws said: 'Sally was killed in a cold-blooded and extremely brutal attack which left her with head injuries she could not possibly survive.

'The evidence in this case shows that Adam Singer killed her. He and Sally had been in a relationship and they had a child together. The relationship was at an end and he wanted custody of the child.

'Sally was not going to agree to that under any circumstances, so he killed her to get his way.'

He added: 'His thoughts had turned to custody of Isabella. That was what he wanted and he knew he was not going to get it by other means.

'He is a large and powerful man, he was armed with a weapon and Sally stood no chance.'

The court heard the pair met in November 2006 and moved in together in May 2010.

Their daughter was born two months later, but early in 2012 the couple split up.

In the days before the murder the court heard how Singer brandished a rolling pin and asked workmates about killing Sally and also spoke of killing himself.

Mr. Laws said: 'He was holding up one of the four rolling pins in his hand and he was waving it around.

'By accident he caught the peak of Keith Johnson’s cap and this gave him a shock.

'He asked Mr Johnson if he was alright, and the next thing he remembers him saying is this, "do you think this would kill someone?"

'Mr Johnson replied that he thought it would, and he was right. Mr Singer continued, "how would you hit someone? Would you hit them on the head or to the side?"'

Mr. Laws added: 'It was, in effect, a rehearsal. There are some moments in a case when the truth is plan for all to see.

'There Adam Singer contemplated the murder or Sally Harrison and identified the weapon from his work place.

'A day or two later the very implement was used to kill Sally by striking her to the top of the head and to the side.'

Bristol Crown Court heard that Singer confessed to a friend he had 'stood at the end of Sally's bed with the rolling pin but did not have the balls' to carry out the attack

Mr Laws said Singer originally denied taking the rolling pin and tried to trick police by leaving their home after the murder and returning around 3am to 'play the part of the bereaved boyfriend'.

He later changed his story to admit taking the cooking utensil but told officers he took it to do some baking with Sally and his daughter.

Friend Simon Gotham told police Singer had 'stood at the end of Sally’s bed with the rolling pin but did not have the balls' to carry out the act, the court heard.

Singer, of Salibsury, Wilts., denies murdering Sally on April 4 2012 and the trial continues.
