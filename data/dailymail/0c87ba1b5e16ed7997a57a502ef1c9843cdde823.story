The radio station behind the tragic prank call to the Duchess of Cambridge’s hospital broke the law, an Australian court was told.

2Day FM acted illegally by recording and broadcasting a conversation with nurse Jacintha Saldanha last December without the consent of the hospital, according to the Australian Communications and Media Authority.

In the call to London’s King Edward VII hospital, hosts Mel Greig and Michael Christian posed as the Prince of Wales and the Queen and duped Mrs Saldanha into revealing details about the Duchess’s health.

Controversy: The 2 Day FM radio presenters Christian and Greig were behind the prank-call which reportedly broke the law

The nurse, 46, was found hanged three days later.

Jacintha Saldanha was duped by the prank call and put the DJs through to the ward

The interim findings emerged in a court hearing yesterday after the station took legal action to try to block the watchdog’s investigation.

The broadcaster faces having its radio licence suspended or even revoked altogether.

One of the Australian DJs behind the prank sparked outrage 
again after accepting a national award for the stunt.

Michael
 Christian, who paired with Mel Greig during the hoax, was named the 'next top jock' of the station in June.

Meanwhile Greig reportedly planned to sue the radio station for 'failing to provide a safe workplace' in wake of the incident.

It was reported earlier this year while Christian returned to work Ms Greig was planning to attend the inquest into Mrs Saldanha's death in London.

Christian and Greig called King 
Edward VII hospital where the Duchess of Cambridge was being treated 
last December pretending to be the Queen and Prince Charles.

Mrs
 Saldanha failed to see their poor impersonations and transferred them 
through to another nurse who revealed some details about her condition.

The stunt drew widespread criticism with the the hospital's boss John Lofthouse saying: 'This was a foolish prank call that we
all deplore.'

Only two months ago, it emerged that 
in one of the three letters she left, Mrs Saldanha directly accused the 
two Australian DJs of driving her to her death. 

Receptionist: ‘Hello, good morning, King Edward VII Hospital’

Female presenter (Mel Greig, impersonating the Queen): ‘Oh, hello there. Could I please speak to Kate please, my granddaughter?’

Receptionist:  ‘Oh yes, just hold on ma’am’

Male presenter (Michael Christian, impersonating Prince Charles): ‘Are they putting us through?’

Greig: ‘Yes’

Christian: ‘If this has worked it is the easiest prank call we have ever made. Your accent sucked by the way, I just want you to know’

[Both laughing]

Greig: ‘I’m not used to playing old an 80-year-old’

[Phone picked up]

Greig: ‘Kate, my darling.  Are you there?’

Nurse: ‘Good morning ma’am, this is the nurse speaking, how may I help you?’

Greig: ‘I’m just after my granddaughter Kate. I want to see how her little tummy bug is going?’

Nurse: ‘She’s sleeping at the moment and she has had an uneventful night. And sleep is good for her. She's been given some fluids [part removed due to patient confidentiality].  She's stable at the moment.'

[Part removed due to patient confidentiality]

Greig:
 ’I’ll just feed my little corgis then. When is a good time to come and 
visit her, because I’m the Queen and I need a lift down there?’

[In background: Mummy, mummy]

‘Charles! When can you take me to the hospital, Charles?’

Christian: ‘When will it be alright to come down and see her?  Maybe in the morning or something if that’s OK?’

Nurse:
 ‘I would suggest that any time after nine o’clock would be suitable 
because the doctor will be in in the morning and will just be getting 
her freshened up. I would think any time after nine.’

Christian: ‘Is Wills still there or has he gone home? I haven’t spoken to him yet.’

Nurse:  ‘He went home probably at about nine o’clock last night, to be fair.’

Christian: ‘Lovely, but are they all ok? Everything is alright?’

Nurse: [Removed due to confidentiality]

Christian: ‘Of course, it’s hardly the palace is it?’

Greig: ‘ It’s nothing like the palace, is it Charles? When are you going to walk those bloody corgis?’ 

Christian: ‘Mumsy, I’ll go and take the dogs outside’

Greig:  ‘I need to go visit Kate in the morning. My dear, thank you so much’ 

Nurse: ‘You are very welcome’

Greig: ‘Goodbye’

Nurse: ‘Goodbye’

[Both presenters burst into laughter]

Greig: ’She was giving real information’

Christian: ‘Mummy I think they just believed everything we just said’
