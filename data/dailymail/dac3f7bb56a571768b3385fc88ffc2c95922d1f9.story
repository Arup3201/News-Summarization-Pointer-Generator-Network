Real Sociedad captain Xabi Prieto has revealed he went straight to Mikel Arteta when he learned that David Moyes would be the club's new manager.

The former Manchester United boss arrived at the Basque club following the departure of Jagoba Arrasate, but the Scot is yet to take charge of a game. 

Moyes took Arteta from Sociedad to Merseyside in 2005. The pair went on to spend six successful years together at Everton, and Prieto insisted the Arsenal man has nothing but praise for the 51-year-old.

'He's a coach with a great track record,' Prieto told Marca. 'He spent eleven years at Everton and signed with a very big club like (Manchester) United, although it didn't go so well. 

'I talked with Arteta who played under him for many years at Everton, and all he had to say was good things about him.

'He (Mikel) told me that he is very demanding and committed to making good relationships with his players. We will try to make him feel comfortable as soon as we can here and hopefully that will allow him to help the team grow.

'It's clear that football in England is different to over here, but hopefully he can adapt quickly and we can get to learn the nuances he will bring here. Most of all, it's important for us to feel the benefit of his arrival.'
