Alexis Sanchez has given the thumbs up to Arsenal's new Christmas jumper as the club raise money for charity.

The £30million summer recruit was all smiles as he posed in the Gunners' red Christmas sweater, which features a football snowman, while a cream version featuring a reindeer in a red Gunners' scarf was modelled by Arsenal Ladies pair Rachel Yankey and Danielle Carter.

Twenty per cent of proceeds from the jumpers' sales will go to the Arsenal Foundation's global charity partner 'Save the Children'.

Having previously plied his trade in Spain and Italy, the Chile international perhaps won't be used to the cold, chilly English wintertime and may find the jumper comes in handy as he enjoys his first Christmas in north London.

Arsenal's clash with Swansea on Sunday will have prepared Sanchez for what's to be expected over the coming months, however, as the rain lashed down during the Gunners' 2-1 defeat in south Wales.

The 25-year-old opened the scoring at a soaked Liberty Stadium but Arsene Wenger's men failed to hold onto their lead as Gylfi Sigurdsson and Bafetimbi Gomis replied for the Swans to claim victory.
