Anthony Weiner was spotted in Union Square Park with he and Huma Abedin's son, Jordon Zain in New York City on Thursday.According to a witness, another child in the playground peed on a swing. The child's father grabbed a napkin to clean up his son's little mess just as Weiner walked over to that same swing.The witness claimed that Weiner yelled, 'Thanks for leaving this thing soaking wet'

He also claimed that the dad was going to clean up the mess and that he allegedly told Weiner, 'It's funny you're the one talking about other people's self control'Anthony Weiner recently lost in the mayoral primaries and attributed his loss to the texting scandal with Sydney Leathers. When he went on the Geraldo Rivera show on Friday he said, 'Of course, Iâ€™m not an idiot, I know it succeeded in derailing my campaign.'

Weiner was seen flipping off a NY1 reporter just days before after a party he had in midtown New York. Leathers crashed the party.

Whether or not Wiener will be able to clean up after his own messes remains unclear.

Wow.  Very good comeback from the other parent.  If I were huma, I would worry about him being alone with the child.  If I were humas parents, I'd worry about her staying with him.

This guy is seriously on his way to getting knocked out by somebody.

That's funny, just the other day he said it was his last name that derailed the campaign. He denied it was the scandal. I can't believe his wife is sticking by him. He couldn't be a bigger joke.

Wouldn't be the first time a child peed on a swing! At least the kid's father made an effort to clean it up. And really, Weiner should be the last person to criticize people.

This idiot needs to be put in an asylum.

He's a joke.

This guy has serious anger issues as well as a problem with taking responsibility for his actions.

He needs help as he is losing it.
