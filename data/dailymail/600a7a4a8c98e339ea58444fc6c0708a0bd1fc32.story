A-level student Zoya Anwar who vanished after saying goodbye to friends at her school gates has been found following a nine day search.

She was spotted by security guards in Birmingham City Centre late last night and was taken to Birmingham Central police station where specially trained officers were interviewing her.

Four men and a woman arrested in connection with her disappearance were yesterday released without charge.

West Midlands police said the decision to release the 
five was taken following a number of sightings of King Edward VI 
student, Zoya Anwar, in the Digbeth area of Birmingham yesterday.

Found: Zoya Anwar, who had not been seen for more than a week, has been found safe and well in Birmingham City Centre by security guards who recognised her from the police appeal

Zoya was last seen more than a week ago at the gates of her school King Edward VI

The A-Level student had not been seen 
since saying goodbye to friends outside her school in Handsworth, 
Birmingham, last Tuesday.

A spokesman for West Midlands Police said: 'Missing teen Zoya Anwar has been found in Birmingham city centre.

'She was 
spotted by security guards who called police after seeing our appeal.

'Zoya has been taken to Birmingham Central police station where specially
trained officers will speak to her to make sure she is ok.

'It goes without saying that we thank everyone who helped the search for 
Zoya by sharing our appeal. You have yet again helped save the day.'

Staff at Zoya's school reported her missing to police on Friday as she had not been seen since the previous Tuesday.

House-to-house inquiries and forensic searches were carried out over the last few days.

A dedicated call centre was also been set up to allow people to pass on information about Zoya' disappearance.

Detectives released three images of Zoya - one in her school uniform and the other two in normal clothes.

Det Supt Chilton said Zoya had never gone missing before and 'it is very out of character for her' and said officers were 'working around the clock' to find her.

Friends of Zoya from inside and outside school were spoken to as part of the investigation.

In a statement, the headmistress of the selective grammar school Elisabeth Wager, said: 'Zoya joined the school in the sixth form with an exemplary school record.

'She has continued to achieve at a high academic standard and has a bright future ahead of her.

'She has firm friendships in the school and we are providing support as required to her friends and the wider school community.'

The school, which has been listed as one of the top 30 state schools in the country, is co-operating fully with the police.
