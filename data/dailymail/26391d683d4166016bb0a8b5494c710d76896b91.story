An entrepreneurial 11-year-old girl had her business dreams dashed after local council staff forced her to shut down her lemonade stall.

The child, who has not been named, whipped up a delicious range of treats to sell near her house but someone reported her to the red-tape enforcers at Bunbury City Council, in Western Australia, The West Australian reports.

Lemon meringue pie, lemon butter cupcakes and fresh organic lemonade were all on offer from ‘11am until sold out’ on 19 December, said the girl in a handwritten poster.

Her outraged mother posted on Facebook that her daughter had her pop-up stall shut down by the council.

Environmental health manager at Bunbury City Council, Sarah Upton, told The West Australian the girl’s stall was ‘high risk’.

‘Unfortunately the stall was selling food without a permit and the young girl in charge was preparing food without approval,’ Ms Upton explained.

The council worker also complained that the girl had no ‘temperature control’ and her location was posing a problem for cars to pull over safely on the side of Brittain Road.

The story comes after a new bill was announced across WA to cut through council red tape and help local governments become more sustainable.

On November 28, Nationals' Member for Moore, Shane Love, told the ABC: 'Councils right throughout the state will be able to now come together and work more closely together, not just with their neighbours but with any other council they want to share a service or an enterprise with.'
