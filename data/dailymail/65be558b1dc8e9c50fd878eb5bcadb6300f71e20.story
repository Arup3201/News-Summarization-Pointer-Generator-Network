The stakes are high for Manchester United as they aim to secure a place in the Champions League next season and Louis van Gaal's men showed their gambling instincts of a different kind on Monday.

Fresh from Sunday's comfortable 3-0 win over top four-rivals Tottenham Hotspur on Sunday, United stars Ashley Young, Juan Mata, Chris Smalling and Phil Jones were present at the club's official launch of their bwin casino app.

The quartet were all smiles with club ambassadors Denis Irwin and Bryan Robson as they promoted the new groundbreaking technology at Manchester's 235 Casino.
