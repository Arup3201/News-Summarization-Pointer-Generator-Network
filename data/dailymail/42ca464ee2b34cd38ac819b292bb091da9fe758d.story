Jonathan Marray claimed his first title since his 2012 Wimbledon triumph as the British doubles expert and Yen-Hsun Lu claimed the Aircel Chennai Open on Sunday.

Marray and Lu, of Chinese Taipei, upset top seeds Raven Klaasen and Leander Paes in straight sets 6-3, 7-6 (7-4) in one hour and 17 minutes.

It ends Marray's long 30-month wait for a tournament win since his shock victory with Dane Freddie Nielsen in the gentleman's doubles at the All England Club.

The 33-year-old from Sheffield has had a number of different partners since then after Nielsen opted to focus on his singles career, and he will team up with Ukrainian Sergiy Stakhovsky at the Australian Open.

Marray is not taking part in either of the doubles events in Sydney and Auckland this week, instead heading straight to Melbourne to prepare for the first Grand Slam of the year,

Marray's victory comes on the same day that fellow Brit Jamie Murray claimed the Brisbane International title, teaming up with Aussie John Peers to beat Alexandr Dolgopolov and Kei Nishikori in the final.
