Melbourne photographer Jonas Peterson has shot weddings in some of the most idyllic parts of the world but his recent assignment to Masai Mara in Kenya has blown some of the most romantic locations off the top of his impressive list.

The destination wedding photographer, originally from Sweden but has called Australia home for the past decade, has travelled to at least 300 jobs around the globe but nothing could have prepared him for the magic of the African savanna.

'Some places stay with you forever. When Nina and her Sebastian asked me to shoot their wedding in Masai Mara in Kenya, I didn't know this land would touch me so deeply,' Peterson said.

'It sung to me in a way I didn't know possible, found new chords and played on strings I didn't know I had inside me.'

Swedish couple Nina and Sebastian got married in September and Melbourne photographer Jonas Peterson captured the occasion

The romantic mood was further enhanced by the dark storm rolling in which made for the perfect backdrop

Nina, a wildlife photographer, has had a close connection to the Masai Mara after spending a couple of months a year in Kenya following one pride of lions for a project about the world's last wild lions

But it did not rain on the parade as the bridal party and guests made it uncover just five minutes before the brooding skies opened up

The traditional Masai Mara elements incorporated into the wedding added to the emotion on the day.

'It was very interesting to see how these cultures came together - it was beautiful and made it all the more powerful,' Peterson said.

The mood was further enhanced by the storm rolling in which made for the perfect backdrop - but it did not rain on the parade as the bridal party and guests made it uncover just five minutes before the sky opened up.

The wedding was held during the migration of wildebeest from Serengeti National Park in Tanzania to the Masai Mara in the neighbouring country of Kenya.

'There animals everywhere which caused a bit of a problem. We needed to have guards at the wedding so animals such as lions didn't wander in,' Peterson said.

'It was like the Garden of Eden with thousands, and probably even millions, of animals as far as the eye can see.'

Peterson described the national park as 'The Garden of Eden'

Nina says it was very important to the couple to incorporate some of the traditions of the Maasai culture into the ceremony

The 42-year-old, who has visited Africa a couple of times before but never to Kenya, was so blown away by the scenery that he had to keep reminding himself to take photographs.

'It was such a powerful experience - it's surprising how nature and vast savannah will do things to you.'

Peterson said the location doesn't necessarily make a great wedding - it's all about the feeling. 

'I've had amazing weddings in Geelong and then terrible weddings in Mexico,' he said. 'If the emotion isn't there it doesn't really matter.'

Rating California, Sri Lanka and the volcanic islands outside of Sicily as some of his favourite weddings, Peterson admits that the Masai Mara is the 'most amazing place he has ever been to'.

'It was the perfect storm in many ways - it was absolutely perfect - culturally, emotionally and location-wise.' 

'It sung to me in a way I didn't know possible, found new chords and played on strings I didn't know I had inside me' Peterson says

The tradionational Masai jewellery, called enkarewa, was also very special aspect of the magical ceremony

The lucky couple made it undercover just before the storm hit across the vast plains

Nina, a wildlife photographer, has had a close connection to the Masai Mara after spending a couple of months a year in Kenya following one pride of lions for a project about the world's last wild lions.

'During this time I have become very close friends and almost family with the Maasai who have welcomed me into their lives,' she said.

'Therefore and because we were planning to hold our ceremony on the land of the Maasai it was very important to us to incorporate some of the traditions of the Maasai culture into the ceremony,' 

'For example the arch built is a traditional symbol of the entrance to a boma – the typical house construction of the Maasai, and after the announcement a traditional Maasai song and dance followed according to tradition.  

'Some places stay with you forever. I didn't know this land would touch me so deeply': Peterson says

The occasion was made even more special by the fact the couple got to share the special day with their two-year-old daughter

The jewellery, called enkarewa, was also very special aspect of the magical ceremony.

'When I first told my closest friend in the Maasai community about our wedding early in 2014 he came back to me with a necklace and bracelets as a special gift made for me by his family, Nina said.

'The stick carried by Sebastian was also a gift from the local Maasai community.'

'But even more generously my friend then offered to bring warriors from the Maasai community to the celebration. So in the end our two cultures and nature merged in the perfect moment and the best day of our lives.'

Peterson could not have asked for a more magical backdrop as the storm drew closer

Peterson spent another five says at Masai Mara after the wedding and fell in love with the incredible sunsets and sunrises

Peterson says the destination can be pointless if there was no emotion which was not a problems on Nina and Sebastian's big day

'It was such a powerful experience - it's surprising how nature and vast savannah will do things to you': Peterson says
