The family of a murder victim have hit out at the 'odious' Jeremy Kyle Show after they say they were twice invited to confront the wife of his killer on television.

Timmy Wallace, 24, was brutally beaten and tortured by his friend Kevin Gibson before his body was bundled into a suitcase and dumped in the Water of Leith in 2003.

Mr Wallace's family say they were first contacted by producers of the ITV show when Gibson, who is serving a 15 year sentence, was allowed to marry and again when he announced he would sue for the right to have conjugal visits with wife Louise Kennedy.

Mr Wallace's stepfather, Martin Edmunds has criticised the attempts to convince his family to appear on television with Ms Kennedy, describing the show as 'odious'.

He said the family would never agree to go on the controversial programme and discuss Mr Wallace's murder.

Mr Edmunds said he had first been approached by producers working for the Jeremy Kyle Show in 2012 when Gibson was allowed to marry Ms Kennedy.

He was contacted again by a production company, who he understood to be working for the show, when the issue of conjugal rights surfaced.

'To be honest, I didn’t give the matter much thought as I was not interested in doing it whatsoever,' he told the Daily Record.

'I do not mind speaking to newspapers and giving my views on the issue 
but when it is used for cheap TV entertainment then it’s not for me.'

A spokesman from the Jeremy Kyle Show said there was no record of Mr Edmunds being asked onto the programme.

'We have no record of approaching Mr Edmunds to appear on on the show,' she said.

'Furthermore, we do not use outside profuction companies to approach potential guests on our behalf.'

This week Gibson was awarded financial assistance, enabling his lawyers to launch a full legal aid bid to fund his fight for the right to have sex with his wife in prison.

He has argued that Scottish Prison Service’s refusal to allow conjugal visits breaches his human rights to have a child with 32-year-old Ms Kennedy and start a family.

He was engaged to Ms Kennedy when he was on remand for the murder, but they split up after he was sentenced.

The couple rekindled the relationship and were married last year at a service inside Addiewell Prison, West Lothian, where Gibson is serving his sentence.

Gibson has been awarded taxpayers’ money for 'advice and assistance' so the couple's lawyers, Taylor & Kelly, of Coatbridge, Lanarkshire, can start preparing a case for legal aid support.

Mr Edmunds, from Galashiels, 
Selkirkshire, Scotland, has hit out at the Scottish Legal Aid 
Board, accusing them of failing crime victims and their families.

'I find the show odious but having heard about the legal aid award perhaps I should have gone on TV,' he said.

The family have not received any compensation for the death, and Mr Edmunds said he will fight to stop Gibson's legal battle.

He said it was wrong that Gibson should be allowed to start a family, having denied Mr Wallace the same opportunity, and that the state should not help to create single parent families.

He added: 'I find it laughably ironic that a killer will receive thousands of 
pounds in public money to pursue this disgraceful action which, if 
successful, will open the floodgates for other criminals to have access 
to conjugal visits, which are currently not allowed in Scottish jails, 
or IVF treatment.'

Mr Edmunds, who works as a JobCentre clerk said that as a civil servant his employers would not approve of him agreeing to appear on the programme.

He said he believed the shows had not been made, and he had not discussed the issue of payment with the production company.

Heroin addict Gibson was living in 
the same homeless hostel as 'trusting and vulnerable' Mr Wallace when he
attacked him; punching, kicking and stamping on his victim as well as 
hitting him with a belt.

He
then threw boiling water over Mr Wallace, who walked with a limp after 
suffering meningitis as a child, before putting the body into the 
suitcase, which he threw over a bridge.

He was found guilty of murder in April 2004 after a trial at the High Court in Edinburgh.

Mr Edmunds, who attended court every day during the trial said he had written to his MP Michael Moore and MSP Christine Grahame, asking them to support his campaign to stop Gibson from being allowed the right to start a family. 

A spokesman from the Scottish Legal Aid Board told MailOnline: 'Advice and Assistance has been granted by Kevin Gibson’s solicitor to prepare an application for legal aid.

'The Scottish Legal Aid Board has not received an application for civil legal aid in regard to this case.

'When considering the grounds for approving a legal aid application of this kind, we look at whether there are fundamental human rights issues that have not been heard before in a Scottish court.

'The background of applicants is not a part of the process to test how the case sits with European Court of Human Rights provisions.'
