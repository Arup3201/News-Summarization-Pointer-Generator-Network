Questioned: Richard Wallace, former editor of The Daily Mirror, was questioned by detectives from Operation Weeting, Scotland Yard's phone hacking investigation, today

The Daily Mirror's former editor Richard Wallace, 51, has been interviewed by police investigating an alleged phone hacking conspiracy at the Mirror Group.

Wallace becomes the latest senior figure with links to Trinity Mirror to be questioned by detectives.

His long-term partner Tina Weaver, former editor of the Sunday Mirror, was one of four executives at the newspaper who were yesterday detained in dawn raids in relation to Scotland Yard's phone hacking investigation.

Wallace was taken to a police station in south London at lunchtime and was questioned under caution by detectives from Operation Weeting before being released without charge.

Weaver, who is heavily-pregnant, was woken at 6am yesterday to be arrested over the allegations.

Speculation is growing that police 
have found a new witness who worked both at Mirror Group Newspapers, the
 Trinity Mirror subsidiary that publishes its national titles, and News 
International.

The surprise development brought the 
Mirror Group for the first time into the Scotland Yard inquiry into 
alleged phone hacking, codenamed Operation Weeting.

Shares in the media group fell by 
more than a fifth when the arrests were revealed. Profits fell 75 per 
cent last year to £18.9m after writing down £66m from past acquisitions 
of websites which failed to shine.

Last night shares closed 24.75p lower than 24 hours earlier at 95.5p - a 21 per cent drop.

The arrests – which centre on an alleged hacking conspiracy ten years ago – are likely to concern Piers Morgan.

The
 former Daily Mirror editor, who now works as a TV host, denied any 
knowledge of phone hacking when he gave evidence in 2011 to the Leveson 
Inquiry into Press standards.

Masthead: James Scott, who is now the editor of the Sunday People, was said to be among those arrested

But later in the inquiry, Newsnight presenter Jeremy Paxman accused Morgan of telling him how to hack into a mobile phone during a lunch at Mirror HQ in 2002. He also said Morgan teased TV presenter Ulrika Jonsson about private conversations she had with Sven-Göran Eriksson.

Earlier that year the Daily Mirror had revealed Miss Jonsson’s affair with the then England football coach.

Miss Weaver, a member of the Press Complaints Commission, is seven months pregnant and in a long-term relationship with another ex-Daily Mirror editor, Richard Wallace.

She also denied any knowledge of phone hacking when she gave evidence at the Leveson Inquiry. But yesterday she was arrested at the couple’s home in South-West London as police detained Sunday People editor James Scott, his deputy Nick Buckley and former Sunday Mirror deputy editor Mark Thomas.

The four were bailed to return to various London police stations next month. Scotland Yard said the alleged conspiracy is being treated separately from the two plots being investigated at the now defunct News of the World, and its inquiry is focused on the Sunday Mirror in 2003 and 2004.

Statement: Scotland Yard said its officers have 'identified and are investigating a suspected conspiracy to intercept telephone voicemails at Mirror Group Newspapers'

In a statement, Scotland Yard said detectives had ‘identified and are investigating a suspected conspiracy to intercept telephone voicemails at Mirror Group Newspapers’.

Simon Fox, chief executive of Trinity Mirror, sent an email to staff confirming the arrests. He said the publisher was ‘co-operating with police’ and has provided Mr Scott and Mr Buckley – who are still with the company – with legal support

Media lawyer Mark Lewis is dealing with civil claims against Mirror Group for four high-profile individuals including Sven-Göran Eriksson, alleging phone hacking.

The three other claimants are Coronation Street actress Shobna Gulati, a former nanny for the Beckhams, and Garry Flitcroft, former captain of Blackburn Rovers.

The latest arrests were seen as a significant widening of Operation Weeting, which had focused mainly on the News of the World and had been expected to be scaled down this year.

A former Sussex Police sergeant will be charged with selling information to the Sun newspaper for £500, prosecutors said today.

James Bowes is accused of misconduct in public office for allegedly passing information on three high profile investigations to the tabloid in 2010. He will appear at Westminster Magistrates' Court on March 26.

The charge he is facing alleges that between April and July 2010 he 'without reasonable excuse or justification, wilfully misconducted himself to such a degree as to amount to an abuse of the public’s trust in that office'.
