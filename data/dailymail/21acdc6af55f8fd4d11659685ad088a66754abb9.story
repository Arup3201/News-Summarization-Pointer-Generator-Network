Belgium plan to exploit Argentina’s over-reliance on Lionel Messi when the two nations meet in Brasilia on Saturday in the World Cup quarter-finals.

Belgium coach Marc Wilmots said: ‘We are not favourites against Argentina but there is a lack of balance in their team. We will make sure we play well against a stronger opponent.’

Chelsea forward Eden Hazard added: ‘We know the best player in the world is in this team, who can make the difference every game. But we are not afraid. If we can stop him we have a chance.’

The fixture has evoked images of 1986 when Argentina legend Diego Maradona terrorised the Belgian defence in the semi-final. But Hazard claims his side will meet the South Americans on the front foot this time.

‘We can win if we attack,’ he said. ‘The whole team is tranquil. We do not feel pressure, we play like we do in training, and that is why we are there.

‘It is a big game for this generation. It is very important. We can make history. This is maybe the biggest game in my life.’

Argentina right back Pablo Zabaleta admitted that his side’s World Cup hopes rest on the shoulders of Messi.

‘We know he is our main player, our captain and the best player in the world,’ he said. ‘This team is playing for him, as we know how important Messi is for us.

‘Every time we recover the ball we try to pass to him. We’re so lucky to have him.’
