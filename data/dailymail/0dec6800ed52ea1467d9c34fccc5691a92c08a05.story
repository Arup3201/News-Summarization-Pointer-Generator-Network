Swiss scientists said they plan to launch a ‘janitor
satellite’ designed to 'clean' the space near Earth of space junk.

The satellite will 'grab' lumps of orbiting debris and throw them back into Earth's atmosphere, where they will burn up on re-entry.

The 10-million-franc - $11-million satellite - called CleanSpace
One is being built by the
Swiss Space Center at the Swiss Federal Institute for Technology in Lausanne.

EPFL said Wednesday its launch would come within three to five
years - its first tasks are to grab two Swiss satellites launched in 2009 and
2010.

The U.S. space agency Nasa says over 500,000 pieces of spent
rocket stages, broken satellites and other debris are being tracked as they
orbit Earth.

The debris travels at speeds approaching 17,500 miles per hour, fast enough to destroy or inflict costly and
time-draining damage on a satellite or spacecraft. Collisions, in turn,
generate more fragments floating in space.

‘It has become essential to be aware of the existence of this
debris and the risks that are run by its proliferation,’ said Claude Nicollier,
an astronaut and EPFL professor.

Building the satellite means developing new technology to
address three big problems, scientists say.

The first hurdle has to do with trajectory: The satellite has
to be able to adjust its path to match that of its target. EPFL said its labs
are looking into a new ultra-compact motor that can do this.

Next, the satellite has to be grab hold of and stabilize the
debris at high speeds. Scientists are studying how plants and animals grip
things as a model for what would be used.

And, finally, CleanSpace One has to be able to take the debris,
or unwanted satellites, back into Earth’s atmosphere, where they will burn on
re-entry.

Swiss Space Center’s director, Volker Gass, said it hopes to
someday ‘offer and sell a whole family of ready-made systems, designed as
sustainably as possible, that are able to de-orbit several different kinds of
satellites.’
