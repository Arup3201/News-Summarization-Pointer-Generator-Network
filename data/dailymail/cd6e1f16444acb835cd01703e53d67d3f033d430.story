Sunderland supporters have raised more than £18,000 in memory of the two Newcastle United fans killed in the Malaysia Airlines crash.

John Alder, 63, and Liam Sweeney, 28, were on their way to New Zealand to watch the Magpies in action on their pre-season tour when flight MH17 was shot down over Ukraine on Thursday.

And followers of Sunderland have now put their traditional rivalry to one side to donate funds for a floral tribute with any extra money going to charities including the Sir Bobby Robson Foundation and Marie Curie.

Support: Sunderland fans have now raised more than £18,000 in memory of Mr Alder and Mr Sweeney

That figure had passed £18,000 on Sunday and the gesture has been applauded by Newcastle fans.

Respected supporter website nufc.com wrote: ‘That is a genuinely heartening story and those involved deserve enormous credit for this incredible gesture.’

Sunderland fan Gary Ferguson created the fundraising page at gofundme.com, and he wrote: ‘We may be Sunderland fans, who traditionally have deep rivalry with Newcastle, but there are things far more important than any football games.

‘The incredibly sad news that has emerged this week about two Newcastle fans who have passed has left us all shocked and deeply saddened.

‘Donating here will help pay for a floral tribute to those fans and to unity between the two clubs. Any extra money will be donated to a charity that has yet to be decided.

‘Thank you for your time, effort and donations.

‘RIP to John Alder and Liam Sweeney, who were both far too young.’

Following news of the loss, Newcastle manager Alan Pardew said: 'Myself and all the players are deeply shocked and saddened by this terrible news. We all knew how passionately John and Liam supported the team and the club.

'They were with us just earlier this week for our first pre-season friendly against Oldham and their dedication to travel all the way around the world to support us in New Zealand tells you all you need to know about the passion they had for Newcastle United. Our hearts go out to their families and friends.'

Respect: Mr Alder and Mr Sweeney were popular and well known among the Toon Army

Meanwhile, Mr Alder's niece Karen Robbins, who lives in Australia, released a message on behalf of the family.

'We would like to thank everyone for their thoughts and wishes and incredibly generous gestures, particularly those who have been able to share personal memories of John,' she said.

'We are struggling to comprehend what has happened but we are touched and moved by your kind words, acts and the knowledge that so many people saw John for who he was, a kind, courteous man who was much loved as a son, brother, uncle and fan.

'Newcastle United was his life and we are proud of his dedication to the team.

'Our thoughts are with Liam's family and the families of the other passengers at this terrible time.'
