A body has been found in woodland close to the Washington home of a six-year-old girl who went missing at the weekend.

The remains, which were discovered by a K9 team at about 11.30am on Thursday, have not been formally identified, but police believe they belong to Jenise Wright.

After her parents reported her missing on Sunday, more than 100 people, including a FBI team, had joined the search for Jenise.

No arrests have been made, and the cause of death has not been revealed but formal identification and results from the autopsy are expected to take place Friday.

In a statement, the sheriff's department 
said a coroner will make official confirmation but 'it 
appears that the body is that of Jenise.'

At a press conference on Thursday afternoon, Kitsap County Sheriff's Deputy Scott Wilson said: 'This is going to be a criminal investigation. There's no doubt about that.'

Wilson confirmed that police were waiting on
 the autopsy results to determine the manner of death, but added: 'We
 suspect that she just did not go off by herself and fall into some 
bushes and die.'

Dozens 
of officers from more than 15 law enforcement agencies had been involved in a door-to-door search at the mobile home park where Jenise lived near 
Bremerton, on the west side of Puget Sound, across from Seattle.

She was last seen when she went to bed Saturday night. Her parents waited a day before calling for help because they say the girl had wandered around the Steele Creek Mobile Home Park on her own in the past.

Wilson had said the family felt it was relatively safe for Jenise, who was described as being outgoing and unafraid to talk to anyone, because the mobile home park is fenced

Police have taken surveillance video from nearby businesses and checked in with sex offenders in the county.

After the search began for Jenise, state child welfare workers removed two other children, an eight-year-old boy and 12-year-old girl, from the home.

Court records show Jenise Wright's father, James Wright, was charged more than a decade ago with molesting two girls, ages 8 and 15.

He eventually pleaded guilty in Whatcom County Superior Court in December 2001 to a misdemeanor assault charge related to the older girl.

It was not immediately clear why the molestation charges were dropped. Prosecutors there did not return calls from the Associated Press.

A judge in Whatcom County Superior Court sentenced Wright to a year in jail but suspended the entire jail term on the condition that he follow certain conditions, including paying fees.

Wilson said at a news briefing on Wednesday that authorities were aware of the past charge against the father, but that officers are focused on finding the girl.Â 

'That has nothing to do with this investigation right now,' he said.

Authorities searched all 103 homes and every outbuilding and vehicle in the Steele Creek Mobile Home Park.
