It appears Bristol Palin is using every platform she can to take a swipe at rival conservative daughter Meghan McCain.

Not content with criticising her in her upcoming memoir Not Afraid of Life: My Journey So Far, when she accused her of complaining and felt she had to 'watch her back' around her, the 20-year-old criticised Ms McCain again when she was interviewed for Sean Hannity's Fox news programme.

When asked about her 'suspicions' and 'problems' with Meghan McCain, Palin replied: 'Yeah I just want to note that we come from two very different worlds, I mean her dad's a politician and my mom's a politician, but that never defined me.

Candid: Bristol Palin talks to Sean Hannity about her 'problems' with Meghan McCain saying that they were very different people and that they do not speak

Family: Bristol said that Meghan let her father's job define her and has never had a job

'We don't talk, we are not friends, nothing like that but I just want to note that we are two very different people.

'I've had a job since I was really little and, um, I don't know if she does stuff like that.'

Bristol Palin's memoir has just been released and has already attracted a lot of controversy for her candid remarks surrounding her teenage pregnancy and ex-boyfriend Levi Johnston as well as her rivals on Dancing with the Stars and Ms McCain.

She recalled one incident when they were in hair and make-up getting ready for  a speech during the McCain campaign and the senator's daughter stormed in, demanding to be done.

Palin wrote: 'As Meghan looked at us, you could tell she was supremely irritated. "I need to be worked on," she barked.

When she was told she had to wait because the others were getting 'more air time' than she was, Palin claims she then screamed: 'If anyone had told me I had to do my own hair and make-up, I would've done my own f***ing hair and make-up.'

In a final dig at her rival, the former Dancing with the Stars contestant then wrote: 'Surely she wasn't so self obsessed that she believed everyone else should scoot over so she could take priority.'

Frenemy: Bristol slammed Meghan McCain in her memoir and said she was always complaining and 'checking them out'

Speaking about Cindy McCain - who is the senator's second wife and heir to a beer fortune - she referred to her as being 'like a Queen' and said: 'I'd never seen people with so much Louis Vuitton luggage, so many cell phones, and so many constant helpers to do hair and makeup.'

She said that Meghan wore thousand dollar dresses and seemed to be 'constantly checking us out, comparing my family to hers and complaining. Oh the complaining.'

She also said she felt like she had to 'watch her back around her.'

Royalty: Bristol said Cindy McCain held herself 'like a queen'

In the years since 2008, Ms McCain has fostered her own time in the limelight, appearing frequently as a young conservative pundit in media, blogging for The Daily Beast and constantly updating her 112,000 Twitter followers.

On June 17, in response to Bristol's remarks, the firebrand tweeted: '"Hi, I'm Meghan McCain" is in no way, shape or form a pickup line. Trust me honey, you'd know it if I was hitting on you.'

Ms Palin wrote that she was mystified when Mrs McCain offered to be a godmother to her unborn baby Tripp: 'I had just met her and I wondered why she wanted any type of guardianship over my child'.

Though the McCains can rest east that Ms Palin seems to have saved her deepest jabs for former fiancée Levi Johnston, who has his own tell-all book scheduled for release this fall.

She refers to her baby's daddy as a 'gnat' who 'cheated on me about as frequently as he sharpened his hockey skates'.

She writes that while her parents allegedly 'accepted' her pregnancy, he wasn't so supportive, saying the child 'Better be a f**king boy'.

Ms Palin claims that Mr Johnston plied her with wine coolers before taking her virginity, then promised it wouldn't happen again until they were married.

That apparently didn't go as planned, as she would become pregnant with his child shortly after.

Later, she claims he admitted to seeing another woman while he was staying at the Palin home with her, and eventually, that he had gotten another women pregnant.
