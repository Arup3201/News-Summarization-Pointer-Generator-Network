David Cameron is facing a Tory rebellion of up to 20 MPs today as he tries to head off calls to hold a referendum on Europe next year.

Maverick Tory Adam Afriyie last night indicated he would defy the Prime Minister and force a Commons vote as he tries to make the PM hold a referendum before the 2015 general election.

Mr Cameron has pledged to hold the referendum by the end of 2017.

In a letter to MPs, Mr Afriyie said: ‘This is Conservative MPs’ last chance to try to secure a  referendum. If we don’t take this opportunity we risk sleepwalking to election defeat by driving voters to Ukip.’

Mr Afriyie has come under intense pressure from Downing Street and some Eurosceptics to drop his amendment to James Wharton’s private member’s bill, which aims to enshrine in law Mr Cameron’s pledge to hold an in/out referendum on Europe by the end of 2017.

Senior Tories fear his intervention could reduce the chance of the legislation becoming law and fuel public perceptions that the Tories remain divided on Europe.

His decision to push for a vote today means Tory MPs now face the prospect of being asked to vote against a potential referendum next year in order to keep the Prime Minister’s plans on track.

A number of prominent Eurosceptics rounded on Mr Afriyie during a stormy meeting of the backbench 1922 Committee on Wednesday night, urging him to back down for the sake of party unity.

His decision to push for a vote today means Tory MPs now face the prospect of being asked to vote against a potential referendum next year in order to keep the Prime Minister’s plans on track.

One source said as many as 20 Tory MPs could vote with Mr Afriyie.

Conservative Peter Bone: 'It's not a Tory split - we all want a referendum'

‘The trouble is there are people in marginal seats, with Ukip breathing down their necks, who don’t want to be seen voting against a referendum in any circumstances,' the source added.

A poll last night showed one third of Tory members support Mr Afriyie’s plan.

The survey by the grassroots website ConservativeHome found that 35 per cent of members want a referendum on Europe to be held in October next year. A further 22 per cent want the referendum held before the Prime Minister’s planned date of 2017. Just 35 per cent fully back Mr Cameron’s timetable.

Tory MP Peter Bone last night said: ‘It’s not a Tory split – we all want a referendum, this would just bring it forward before the election.’

But veteran Eurosceptic Bill Cash warned the amendment could derail the Conservative Party’s concerted bid to finally hold a referendum on Europe.

Mr Cash said: ‘It is a very difficult issue. Many people would like to see a referendum before the election - I am one of them.

‘But there are a number of practical difficulties and there is also the issue of party unity. We have been united from top to bottom on this - how will it look if we end up looking disunited again?’

The Liberal Democrats have refused to support Mr Cameron’s plans, forcing the Conservatives to use a private member’s bill to try to get his pledge into law.

Labour opposes Mr Cameron’s plan to hold a referendum in 2017 but has so far abstained in votes on Mr Wharton’s bill.

However, the legislation faces a difficult route to becoming law, as it could easily be blocked in the House of Lords.
