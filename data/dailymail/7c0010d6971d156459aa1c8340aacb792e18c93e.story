A motorbike rider accidentally created a hilarious YouTube video when the wheelie stunt he was performing went wrong. 

While teetering on the bikes back wheel the rider mistakenly accelerates and goes flying into the fence. 

The rider no doubt hoped his tricks would go viral because people were admiring his stunt prowess, but YouTubers are watching the video, which is gaining momentum online for quite different reasons.

Instead those sharing the amusing clip seem to be doing so only in order to laugh at the fallen show-off. 

Commenters repeatedly label the rider an 'idiot', while one user, Michael B, gets a sense of schadenfreude from the funny film. 'Having a bad day? Get to work, click on a Jukin video and it cheers you right up', he says. 

The rider, luckily, seems not to come to any harm, that's more than you can say for the fence, which takes the full brunt of the gaffe and collapses under the sheer force of the bike.

The rider seems to have things under control...
