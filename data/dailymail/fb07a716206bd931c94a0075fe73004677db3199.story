Michael Winner has revealed he may choose to take his own life at the Dignitas clinic in Switzerland.

The film director and restaurant critic, 76, said he has researched services at the assisted-dying institution.

Earlier this year he revealed that liver specialists had told him he has 18 months to live.

Decision: Michael Winner has said he may go to the Dignitas clinic in Switzerland to end his life

He talked about his research into assisted suicide in a newspaper interview – before telling his wife.

He said: ‘I checked Dignitas on the computer and you need to go through so much. It’s not a walk-in death.

'You don’t just go in and say “Here I am, do your worst”.

‘You have to go through a whole series of papers and re-examinations just to die. 

'You have to fill in forms and things and you have to fly there, go back twice.’

He
said his wife Geraldine, who he married last year after first meeting 
her 55 years ago, ‘would be shocked to know I’m even talking about it’.

More than 150 Britons have travelled to Switzerland to end their lives since the clinic opened.

Winner, whose films include the Death Wish series, has struggled with ill-health since eating a bad oyster on holiday in Barbados in 2007.

He was almost killed by the bacteria Vibrio vulnificus.

He was on the brink of death five 
times and underwent a gruelling 19 operations, one of which removed his 
Achilles tendon, leaving him with mobility difficulties.

But he insisted he was not frightened of death and believes he should be able to end his own life.

‘I think the idea that people should be able to have an assisted suicide is absolutely, highly proper,’ he said.

‘Why should people elongate life when it’s no good for them?

'People should have the right to terminate their own life. I’m very happy to snuff it. I’ve had enough time on Earth.

Dignitas was founded in 1998 by Ludwig A. Minelli, a Swiss lawyer.

Swiss laws provide that assistance to suicide is only illegal if it is motivated by self-interest.

The person who wishes to die meets several Dignitas personnel, in addition to an independent doctor, for a private consultation.

The independent doctor assesses the evidence provided by the patient and is met on two separate occasions, with a time gap between each of the consultations.

Finally, a few minutes before the lethal overdose is provided, the person is once again reminded that taking the overdose will surely kill them.

Dignitas assisted well over 1000 people to commit suicide, since 1998

More than 150 Britons are believed to be among that number

Some 85 per cent of clients come from outside Switzerland

The largest groups, by nationality, are German, then British, then French

'I’d be happy if someone gave me the plug to pull.’

Winner first met his wife in 1957 when she was an aspiring 16-year-old actress and ballet dancer and he a 21-year-old film-maker. They began dating after she auditioned for a role in his first film.

However, they split after several months and she moved to France, where she married and had three children, while he moved to Hollywood when his film career took off.

It was during this time that Mr Winner claimed he enjoyed 40 lovers every year, admitting he was ‘grossly unfaithful’.

His numerous girlfriends have included actress Jenny Seagrove, whom he was with from 1987 to 1994. He dated ex-Benny Hill girl Lorraine Doyle between 1984 and 1986 and also actress Vanessa Perry, who is 30 years his junior, for five years until 1999.

He always claimed he never wanted to marry, blaming his reluctance on a ‘mental deficiency’.

In 2005, he rekindled his romance with Miss Lynton-Edwards and asked her to move into his palatial London home. However, shortly afterwards, he evicted her and took up with his secretary, Paola Lombard, 39.

The affair only lasted a number of weeks and he and Miss Lynton-Edwards got back together soon after.
