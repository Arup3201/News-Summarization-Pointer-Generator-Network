With their legs outstretched and bodies artfully poised, these male praying mantises look as though they are about to bust a move on the insect version of Strictly Come Dancing.

But these other-worldly insects should be warned, because if they attract a female of the species it could be their last dance.

If they are deemed worthy by the female they will begin mating, but she-mantises are renowned for chewing off their partner's head after, or even during, the act.

This act of sexual cannibalism surprisingly increases the success and duration of copulation as males have been observed thrusting more vigorously after decapitation. 

The dancing mantises were captured by Polish research scientist Igor Siwanowizc, who spends hours each day caring for his pets.

There are more than 2,400 different species of mantises, or mantodea, who have been given the prefix 'praying' due to their prayer-like posture.

Mantises have two spiked forelegs in which prey items are caught and held securely and they can have a visual range of up to 20 metres.

Praying mantises can effectively blend into the background, which can be used for both attack and defence, with some going as far as looking like leaves, grass or even stones.
