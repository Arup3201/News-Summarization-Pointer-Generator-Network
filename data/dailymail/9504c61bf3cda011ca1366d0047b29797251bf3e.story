She tipped the scales at 132kg when her husband of four years dumped her over the phone.

But it proved to be a godsend for Brodie Adriaens who decided to use the devastating breakup as inspiration to shed the morbidly obese title and lose a whopping 60kg.

Fast forward two years and the Perth 33-year-old now weighs a healthy 72kg and says she's happier and healthier for it.

'I was always a big girl throughout my entire childhood – I always struggled with my weight but it got worse as I got married. I was very unhappy so food was my comfort,' Ms Adriaens told Daily Mail Australia.

'I put on 18kg during my four-year marriage. My heaviest was 140kg while we were together.'

While Ms Adriaens doesn't believe her marriage broke down because of her weight, she says her ex-husband essentially fuelled her weight gain. 

'In some ways I think he wanted me bigger and unhappy so I wouldn't leave,' she said. 

'We used to eat Maccas all the time. I would eat a double quarter pounder, a big mac and a McChicken burger all in one sitting. I'd always have a shake or a frozen coke.

'The quantity of what I ate was just ridiculous. I just wouldn't stop eating.'

Ms Adriaens said while she had tried to lose weight while she married, the turning point was when that relationship ended. 

'I thought if I'm going to be single, I'm going to be skinny,' she said. 

'Changing your body is fairly easy I've found, but changing the mind is the difficult part.

'I've always known what's healthy but my mindset was wrong. I used to tell myself I didn't like salad so I just wouldn't eat it.'

Brodie said while she tried to lose weight while she married, the turning point was when that relationship ended

Ms Adriaens cut out the junk food, introduced fruit and vegetables into her diet and started exercising for an hour every day.

'I've found a love for running, going to the gym and swimming. I'd wake up early everyday and mix it up. I even ran a marathon in August, which was a massive milestone,' she said. 

'I also eat salad everyday now. They're the best. I play around with them and get creative by chucking in heaps of raw veggies.'

But her change in eating and exercising has had a flow on effect to other areas of her life.

'I feel awesome. I don't get sick anymore, I'm confident and happy. I've got so much energy I never want to stand still,' she said. 

Brodie took up running to shed the kilos and has since competed in a half marathon and marathon

She now has a new partner, father-of-three Trevor, who was a friend for several years before they dated

'My outlook on everything is completely different. I was so negative all the time, I had a victim mentality. Now if anything bad happens I brush it off – I can do anything I want.'

Ms Adriaens now has a new partner, father-of-three Trevor, who was a friend for several years before they started dating.

'I knew he had a crush on me for ages, but I had to learn to love everything about myself before I could start dating,' she said.

'It's been a whirlwind ever since. He really has opened my eyes to true happiness.' 

Ms Adriaens' long term goal is to open a family-orientated gym in a bid to combat childhood obesity. 

'I went through it and I know how unhappy I was. I don't want other children to feel like that. It's a parents job to teach their kids about health and nutrition and I want to help,' she said.
