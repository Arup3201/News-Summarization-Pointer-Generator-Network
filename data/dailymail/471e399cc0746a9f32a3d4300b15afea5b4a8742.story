Best-selling author and self-styled weight loss guru Kevin Trudeau was sentenced Monday to 10 years in prison for bilking consumers through late night infomercials.

Trudeau's book 'The Weight Loss Cure 'They' Don't Want You to Know About' sold more than 850,000 copies at $30 a piece through oft-played tv infomercials a federal judge decided were part of a con. A $37million judgement was also entered against him.

The pitchman's lawyer argued the sentence was too harsh and said the most anyone lost through his commercials was $30, but the judge disagreed, calling him a habitual fraudster.

Trudeau has been an 'unrepentant, untiring, and uncontrollable huckster who has defrauded the unsuspecting for 30 years,' said U.S. District Court Judge Ronald Guzman.

Guzman even noted a time he once even used his own mother's Social Security number in a scheme.

'Since his 20s, he has steadfastly attempted to cheat others for his own gain,' the judge continued, adding that Trudeau is 'deceitful to the very core.'

Trudeau's trademark dyed black hair turned partially gray while sitting in jail, he showed little emotion as the stiff sentence was handed down at the hearing in Chicago.

He insisted he's become a changed man while addressing the judge just before sentencing, saying he's meditated, prayed and read self-help books while locked up at Chicago's Metropolitan Correctional Center.

'I have truly had a significant reawakening,' said Trudeau, who was dressed in orange jail clothes. 'If I ever do an infomercial again ... I promise: No embellishments, no puffery, no lies.'

A Trudeau supporter interrupted Guzman as he read his judgement. That person then cut the judge short a second time and was carried out by a U.S. Marshal.

Neither Trudeau's pleas for leaniency or the supporter's words were enough to sway the judge after jurors convicted Trudeau of criminal contempt in November for defying a 2004 court order barring him from running false ads about the weight-loss book.

Despite the order, he aired the infomercials at least 32,000 times, according to prosecutors.

He sold more than 850,000 copies of the weight-loss book, generating $39 million in revenue, prosecutors say. And the judge agreed with prosecutors that the amount of loss stemming from Trudeau's deception was more than $37 million — nearly the amount in revenue.

But in remarks Monday asking for a sentence of less than two years for his client, defense attorney Tom Kirsch said the harm Trudeau caused was minor compared to fraud in which some people are cheated out of their life savings.

'A 10-year sentence might be appropriate 
for a defendant who destroyed lives,' Kirsch said. '(But) Trudeau — if 
he swindled anyone — swindled them out of $30 (the price of the book).'

Kevin Trudeau made late-night infomercials for more that 20 years.

Doctors have expressed concern in the past about his book Natural Cures They Don't Want You To Know About which has sold more than five million copies and appeared at the top of non-fiction bestseller lists.

His claims include: 'The sun does not cause cancer. Sun block has been shown to cause cancer.'

Another one of his statements is that Aids is 'one of the greatest hoaxes and deceptions ever perpetrated on the American public'.

The FTC first came after Trudeau in 1998 for making false claims on TV.

He claimed his alternative medicines could cause dramatic weight loss and cure addictions to alcohol, cigarettes and heroin.

He even said the herbal remedies could give users a photographic memory.

More than 25 million Americans have purchased products from Trudeau.

A look at some of the steps Trudeau recommended to people looking to lose weight might provide some insight into why the judge felt otherwise.

Trudeau's 'Weight Loss Cure 'They' Don't Want You to Know About' involved a three step process detailed in a WebMD critique.

Step one involved switching over to an all-organic diet, colonics and liver cleanses, among other steps.

Step two was to take daily injections of human chorionicgonadotropin, an enzyme found in urine that has not been approved for use as a weight loss treatment in the United States.

Step three involved eating anything the dieter wanted, as long as it was organic, while continuing the cleanses but stopping the injections.

The fourth and final step includes cleansing of the kidneys and liver, as well as ridding one's body of parasites and metals.

It is notable that Trudeau has no medical certifications and has written other books touting the benefits of holistic medicine.

'He preys on the fears of consumers, giving them someone to blame for their overweight or obese conditions,' RD, LD Kathleen Zelman writes on the site.

Another defense attorney, Carolyn Gurland, added that Trudeau's legal troubles had already cost him his businesses and his home, and nearly all his other worldly possessions.

'He has a suitcase containing his personal artifacts. That's what he has left,' she said.

But Guzman showed little sympathy, appearing angry as he said that Trudeau had thumbed his nose at the justice system by violating multiple court orders since the 1990s

'He has treated federal court orders as if they were mere suggestions ... or impediments to be side-stepped, out-maneuvered or just ignored,' the judge said.

Trudeau's weight-loss book describes a grueling, 500-calorie-a-day diet, as well as hormone treatments. The deception, Guzman explained, came in Trudeau's infomercials that misrepresented the contents of the book as laying out 'a simple, no hunger... diet-free method of losing weight,' which enticed more people to buy the book.

Trudeau became rich selling millions of books with titles such as 'Natural Cures 'They' Don't Want You to Know About' and 'Debt Cures 'They' Don't Want You to Know About,' touting them in commercials using sometimes hour-long news-interview formats.

As legal scrutiny intensified over the years, Trudeau claimed the U.S. government was out to get him, and he accused agencies and other vested interests of conspiring to suppress low-cost, common remedies to diseases, including cancer.

His weight-loss book, which once topped best-seller lists, was the focus of the criminal conviction for which he was sentenced. It also was the subject of related civil case brought by the Federal Trade Commission, in which Trudeau was ordered to pay a $37 million judgment.

In that civil case, Trudeau said he couldn't pay the judgment because he's broke. But FTC lawyers balked at that claim, accusing him of hiding money in shell companies. Trudeau, they noted, has spent lavishly in recent years, including $359 on two haircuts.
