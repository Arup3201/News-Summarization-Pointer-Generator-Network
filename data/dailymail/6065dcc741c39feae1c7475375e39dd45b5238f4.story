Picture this: a sprawling three-level apartment 17 storeys above the stunning cityscape, where you can gaze down on the hustle and bustle of the street below from the comfort of your rooftop infinity pool.

Arguably Sydney's most luxurious apartment, the penthouse apartment of the Eliza - 141-143 Elizabeth Street in Sydney - has finally hit the market and is listed at a cool $15 million.

Overlooking Hyde Park and occupying the 15th - 17th floors of the stunning and architecturally unique creation that is the Eliza building, the apartment boasts 3.8 metre high ceilings and even comes with a passenger lift for those who don't wish to take the stairs.

The Eliza penthouse, which looks over Sydney's bustling CBD, is on the market for $15 million

There are four bedrooms and six bathrooms spread across the 499 square metre property, and also included in the skyhouse are a private lobby and huge open plan living areas, Property Observer reported.

The top level of the penthouse is designed for entertaining, with a large terrace, an outdoor kitchen and an enormous infinity pool. 

The master bedroom boasts its own study area, as well as a walk-in-wardrobe and a dressing 'chamber'.

The kitchen, with its limestone floors, marble benchtops and splashbacks has a 'fully-integrated' $50,000 fridge. For some that's more than the price of a brand new luxury vehicle or the deposit on a property.

And apart from that the apartment is also home to a $350,000 marble staircase, a working fireplace and electronically-controlled curtains.

All living and dining spaces - as well as at least one of the bathrooms - feature floor to ceiling glass giving way to breathtaking views of the city from many parts of the house. 

There are three car spaces available underneath the spacious property accessible via a private driveway.

The Eliza was designed by architect Tony Owen before being built and developed by construction company Ceerose, founded by Edward Doueihi.

It features sweeping views of the city, overlooks the iconic St Mary's Cathedral plus Sydney Harbour and beyond

Floor-to-ceiling windows in almost every room give way to spectacular views, even from the bathtub 

'We wanted to create a building with an architectural point of difference that did justice to our landmark site in arguably Sydney’s most beautiful street,' Doueihi told Property Observer.

Renowned real estate agent John McGrath also spoke to the website about the stunning property, which he said was an important addition to the area.

'It makes use of the world’s finest materials and finishes in a technologically brilliant way, and everything is over-specified, including double glazing and acoustic innovations to ensure whisper-quiet interiors,' he said.
