Angel di Maria is delighted with his start to life at Manchester United after bagging his first goal and assist in the club’s 4-0 win over QPR on Sunday.

Di Maria, a British record move for £60million from Real Madrid, helped United pick up their first three points of the season, receiving the man of the match award in the process.

The Argentine is on top form having impressed for his country last week, and says manager Louis van Gaal’s style suits him.

He told Fox Sports: ‘I have made a great start and I think people are happy with me. I hope I can go on to score many more goals so that people remain happy with me.

‘I was really looking forward to the arrival of this special day. You can always dream or imagine that you are going to score a goal but it is not always easy. To get a goal and an assist brings me immense happiness.’

Van Gaal’s new ‘Gaalacticos’ finally brought a smile to United fans’ faces, and Di Maria is desperate to push on this season under the Dutchman.

‘Van Gaal at the end of the day is what every coach is like. He demands a high intensity from his players and wants us to press high up the pitch and score goals.

‘I like his style and we proved that we can perform what he wants us to do. He wants us to keep the ball and pass and move it around. To keep possession throughout the game and all over the pitch.’
