Canadian parents who have suffered the loss of three of their sons are sharing their heartbreaking story.

Anne and Clifford Arnall raised their six children on a farm near the tiny community of Ravenscrag, Saskatchewan.

Then, on March 25, 2008, tragedy struck when their son Blake, just 14, was killed while out on an all-terrain vehicle.

The already suffering parents then had to deal with this nightmare again on July 23, 2014 when their sons Sean and Lyndon died in a tractor accident.

Three deaths in just six years.

'It destroyed an entire generation that should be running that farm … There’s no future there now that they’re gone,' Clifford told the National Post.

Clifford has now left the farm and taken a construction job five hours away, saying he does not know if he will ever return to the farm after burying two of his sons this summer as the 'loss is too much to bear.'

Sean and Lyndon were laid to rest in the same coffin. 

Anne drives the five hours once a week to go be with him.

'I could never imagine how or why I would be asked to have to do this,' Anne says of the deaths.

'You try to figure out whether you’re supposed to gain something or whether you’re supposed to change somehow or what you’re being tested for … and I don’t have the slightest idea.'

The couple also take time to address the belief held by some that they are responsible for their children's death and for allowing them to ride these vehicles and work on the farm at such a young age. 

Anne said the boys now working on the farm was not an option, saying that 'Sean and Lyndon were energetic boys and she didn’t want them growing up in a bubble, playing video games in the basement.'

Now, with no one left on the farm and her three older children, daughters Chantal, 26, and  Olivia, 18, and son Dylan ,24, out of the house, Anne gets very lonely she admits, and sad - but only briefly, making sure to keep it in an imaginary box.

'I open it a little bit every day and I have my little bit of sad time and crying and whatever I need to do. Then I shut that box … I don’t have to throw it open and cope with it all right now,' she says.

'I’ll carry that box forever.'
