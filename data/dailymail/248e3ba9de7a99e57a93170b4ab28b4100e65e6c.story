Growing problems: Will Young is rumoured to be getting a hair transplant

Singer Will Young is planning to have a hair transplant, according to a source close to the star.

The Pop Idol winner has previously spoken about taking anti-baldness medication Propecia as a preventive measure.

Now a West End star, Young is sensitive about his thinning locks and an insider on his touring production of Cabaret says he fears that harsh theatre lights highlight his receding hairline.

Young has said  of going bald: ‘It’s a horrible thing – it’s emasculating. You just feel you aren’t sexy any more.’

He can take heart from the experience of actor James Nesbitt, who says that his hair transplant in 2010 won him a new legion of male fans.

‘A lot of men have come up to me and said it inspired them,’ says the Cold Feet star.

‘I have no embarrassment about what I did.’

The painstaking process involves extracting hairs from the back of the head and implanting them follicle by follicle into the thinning areas.

Sun creams may provide excellent protection against harmful UVB rays but they are less effective against UVA – yet these rays trigger the release of iron and free radicals, which can cause cancer.

Now scientists at the University of Bath have created an innovative, light-sensitive ingredient that is activated by UVA and then releases antioxidants to neutralise free radicals.

The product also frees molecules known as ‘caged-iron chelators’ to capture excess iron in the skin. The release of iron has been shown to play a key role in skin ageing. It is hoped  the new product may be commercially available within three years.

Yonanas! No, it’s not another slang term used by teenagers but the new must-have device among celebrities.

Able to turn frozen bananas into guilt-free ‘ice cream’, it was invented by a personal chef and is especially popular with people who want to lose weight, diabetics and those with a lactose intolerance.

Costing £45, Yonanas was also spotted being used by Kourtney Kardashian on her reality show, Keeping Up With The Kardashians.

The
key to beating migraines could be losing weight, according to a new 
study. US researchers found that those who were obese were 81 per cent 
more likely to suffer migraines than those of a healthy weight.

One
theory is that fatty tissue releases inflammatory substances that may 
cause attacks. Another explanation is that the region of the brain 
responsible for migraines also affects appetite.

‘Patients
with infrequent migraines are at a high risk of developing chronic 
migraines if they are obese,’ says consultant neurologist Dr Fayyaz 
Ahmed.

‘We also know that obesity is a high risk for blood clots in the brain, of which migraines can be a symptom.’
