The last thing England need is Andrea Pirlo with added inspiration, but the Italian playmaker is plotting a meeting today with Brazil’s free-kick maestro Juninho Pernambucano, the man he studied to perfect his own dead-ball style.

Juninho, who spent eight years in Europe at Lyon, has been invited to Italy’s training base two hours west of Rio de Janeiro to meet Pirlo, who wrote in his autobiography how he would spend hours scrutinising the Brazilian’s free-kick technique.

‘That man made the ball do some quite extraordinary things,’ wrote Pirlo. ‘He never went wrong. Never. I checked out his stats and realised it couldn’t just be chance.’

Pirlo scoured video clips and old photographs of Juninho in action and eventually cracked the puzzle.

‘The search for Juninho’s secret had become an obsession with me,’ he confessed, but he did finally unearth the magic formula. ‘It was all about how he struck the ball, not where,’ he added.

‘Only three of his toes came into contact with the ball, not the whole foot.’

Pirlo was the architect of England’s Euro 2012 downfall in Kiev, dictating a game his team somehow failed to win in 120 minutes of total domination before scoring in the penalty shootout with a ‘Panenka-style’ chip against Joe Hart.

He will again be a central figure in Manaus, where the heat and humidity will make possession more valuable than ever.

Key: Italy have not been at their best in the warm-ups, but Pirlo will strike fear into the English team

Mario Balotelli should face England on Saturday with an extra spring in his step after announcing his engagement to model Fanny Neguesha.

She posted the news on Instagram, along with a snap of her new ring.

‘There are two different styles of play: Italy more technical and England more physical,’ said Juventus’s Claudio Marchisio.

This feeling supports the quiet confidence in evidence at Casa Azzurri, the Italian World Cup camp, in Mangaratiba, steaming yesterday after hours of rain.

Marchisio appears in good shape heading into the World Cup. Yet he smiled when this suggestion was put to him, shook his head and dabbed his brow with a napkin.

‘It is so hot,’ he said.

Cesare Prandelli’s side have not won since September and failed to beat Luxembourg last week, yet this is shrugged off as a typically Italian form of preparation.

Prandelli is vexed by the team’s defensive frailties, which is leading him towards fielding a single striker.

Confident: Claudio Marchisio believes Italy will flourish despite less than convincing preparations

Even when winning a practice match against Fluminense on Sunday — a game beamed into England’s hotel for the benefit of Roy Hodgson and his coaches — the Italians conceded three goals.

Centre half Giorgio Chiellini was not risked because injury was such an unbearable thought and his Juventus team-mate Andrea Barzagli is managing a sore heel. He is expected to start against England but could be rested for Costa Rica as Prandelli plans for a potentially crucial final group game with Uruguay.

A fever has ruled PSG’s Marco Verratti out of training for three days, fuelling fears he may miss Saturday’s game in Manaus, but traditionally Italy are seldom more dangerous than when approaching a big tournament in utter disarray.

Russia beat Italy 3-0 ahead of Euro 2012 and still Prandelli’s team reached the final. The world titles of 2006 and 1982 were won while corruption scandals raged at home.

‘That is a very dangerous route to go down,’ declared Hodgson last week, when he detected optimism infiltrating the English press corps after the Luxembourg result.

Italy don’t do friendlies, was basically Hodgson’s argument and it was echoed by Marchisio. ‘We know we have put hard work into our legs in these preparation games,’ said the Juve midfielder.

‘We will be OK. Against England, it’s always a great match. England are a different team from two years ago, but we have changed, too. We have more experience. This will talk on the pitch.’

At Casa Azzurri, briefings with Marchisio and Napoli striker Lorenzo Insigne were followed by pasta, espresso and the deep notes of a Bontempi organ which drowned out the competitive noise of several table football games.

Italy are quietly confident ahead of what they view as the pivotal game in the group. Win this and a draw will be enough against Uruguay.

That, at least, is the theory and that is before Juninho Pernambucano pops in to give Pirlo a lift.
