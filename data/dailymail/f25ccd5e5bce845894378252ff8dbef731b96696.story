Jamie Vardy once nearly caused a riot in Luton. Three years later and four leagues higher, his presence sparks crowds into a frenzy in the Far East.

Having ascended from Fleetwood Town to Leicester City, this summer he was flown to Bangkok by the club’s Thai owners to celebrate promotion and meet hundreds of fans. ‘The attention is mad over there,’ says Vardy. ‘Loads of people welcome us and give us Thai bracelets and stuff like that. They have dancers, everything.’

Quite different from a memorable occasion in non-League football in November 2011 when the crowd had more hostile intentions.

Jamie Vardy scores Leicester's fourth goal during their demolition of Manchester United in September 

Vardy was in sensational form during his side's 5-3 victory over Louis van Gaal's side 

The Leicester City striker bagged four assists on top of his goal on a memorable day for the Foxes 

‘In my year at Fleetwood, we played at Luton and that was just carnage,’ recalls the 27-year-old striker. ‘We were winning 1-0 at half-time, I’d dinked the keeper and obviously celebrated a bit madly.

‘Their fans were rocking the tunnel and all their players were trying to get hold of one of our strikers. The police came into the dressing room and told us if we were going to start a riot they’d lock us up.’

Such events explain why Vardy says he pinches himself every day to believe he has risen so far, so fast. He sprung to attention in late September by bullying Manchester United in a display that earned him four assists and a first Premier League goal. ‘Madness,’ he reflects.

Buddhist monks were at the King Power Stadium for Leicester's 5-3 win against Manchester United

But now that 5-3 win is a distant memory. Not another goal for him, and no more wins for his team. The Srivaddhanaprabha family, who own Leicester, have called back the Buddhist monks who blessed the players prior to the remarkable rout of Louis van Gaal’s side.

Liverpool provide the opposition at the King Power Stadium tonight and any good karma would be welcome. The players are familiar with the religious ceremony by now and are on friendly terms with the monks.

‘They come with little sticks, dip them in holy water and then slap you over the head as hard as they can,’ Vardy says. ‘Before the United game it was like I’d had a bath — heads, shoulders, legs. It worked though, didn’t it! They need to come back more often.’ Ultimately, though, Vardy knows it is up to the players and boss Nigel Pearson to turn it around. Leicester are on a run of two points from 24, and have slid to the bottom of the table, but he is positive.

‘After the start we had, we know we’re capable of beating teams and we’ve just had a little dip,’ he says.

Vardy has come back from greater adversity. As a teenager at Stocksbridge Park Steels, on the eighth rung of the football ladder, he wore an electronic tag having been convicted of assault.

He claimed he was protecting a friend being attacked by a group outside a pub. ‘It wasn’t nice wearing the tag and having to be in at 6pm every night. I learned from that and things started looking up.

‘Now we have to make sure we put 100 per cent effort in, run ourselves into the ground if we have to.’

Vardy leads from the front in that respect. ‘I’m just a pest,’ he smiles. ‘That’s all I’ve ever been. I don’t know how to play any different.There is no sitting off, I just go straight at them.’

Liverpool present a serious challenge tonight but you sense Vardy is eager to run at a defence that has not been at its best this season. And come the end of the campaign, 17th in the table will do.

‘We would just be happy if we stay up,’ he says. ‘We want to stay in this league and then kick on again. Any finish will do.’
