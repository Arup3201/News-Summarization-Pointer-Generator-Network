Some of the U.S. and Asia's largest cities are predicted to be among the most susceptible to coastal flooding in the world, scientists have warned.

Researchers say that New York, Miami, New Orleans and Boston in the U.S. are all among the top 20 cities at the highest risk of coastal flooding and could all find themselves facing extensive and frequent flood damage if sea levels rise to predicted levels by 2050.

Even if sea levels rose to the best-case scenarios predicted by scientists, the yearly global cost of repairing damage caused by coastal foods could top $1 trillion, according to the study.

A team at the University of Southampton looked at 136 coastal cities with more than 1 million residents as well as the population distribution, types of flood protection in place and elevation of storms.

To compile the top 20 list, they combined data about the cities with sea level predictions for 2050, plus economic and population forecasts to calculate the cost of the damage based upon the depth of water that could cover a city.

In the best and worst-case scenarios of estimating the magnitude of future flood damage across the world, the scientists said the flooding repair bill topped $1 trillion, Live Science reported.

2. Mumbai, India

3. Kolkata, India

4. Guayaquil, Ecuador

5. Shenzen, China

6. Miami, Florida, U.S.

7. Tianjin, China

8. New York, Newark, New Jersey, U.S.

9. Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam

10. New Orleans, Louisiana, U.S.

According to the study published in the journal Nature Climate Change, the most vulnerable city is Guangzhou in China, with Mumbai and Kolkata in India making up the rest of the top three.

The vast majority of cities listed are in Asia and North America.

The U.S. makes up a quarter of the cities most at risk of coastal flooding in 2050 in the list of the  top 20, while China comprises one fifth and India a quarter.

In the U.S. Miami was listed as having the highest exposure to coastal flooding if sea levels rise.

The popular holiday destination was followed by New York, New Orleans, Tampa St Petersburg and Boston.

17. Boston, Massachusetts, U.S.

18. Bangkok, Thailand

19. Xiamen, China

20. Nagoya, Japan

The study suggests the cost of 
flood damage could be reduced if flood mitigation infrastructure is 
built in the named cities.

Robert Nicholls, a coastal engineering professor at the University of Southampton, told LiveScience: 'If
we did nothing about the risk, the flood damages in coastal cities 
would grow to huge amounts. So that's really not an option.'

The study said that if cities did bolster their flood prevention measures, such as erecting storm surge barriers, increasing the height of levees, flood-proofing buildings and converting low-lying areas to parks or fileds, the cost of damage could be lowered to around $50 billion a year.

Many climate change scientists have predicted that cities will be battered by increasingly fierce and frequent storms over the coming decades and some have suggested that we are already seeing the effects in storms such as Hurricane Sandy.

The researchers at Southampton University set out to identify the cities most at risk of coastal flooding after they realised scientists did not know which cities were most vulnerable to flash flooding, following Hurricane Katrina, which swept through the Gulf Coast in 2005.

Nicholls reportedly believes it is prudent for cities to put measures in place as soon as possible to prevent vast amounts of damage created by extreme weather events becoming the norm.

He said: 'The bottom line is it shows that flood risk is rising today — it's happening.

'All these cities need to be preparing for that.'

The research is part of an ongoing project by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and is being led by Dr Stephane Hallegatte, from the World Bank.
