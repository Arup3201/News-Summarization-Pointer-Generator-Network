The world may be increasingly uncivil and the workplace is no exception.

A U.S. study has found that checking text messages or taking a call during a meeting or business lunch is unacceptable to the majority of people.

But the researchers found that women were twice as easily offended by men by the antisocial behaviour.

The study found that three out of four people said checking texts or emails was poor behaviour in business meetings, while 87 per cent termed answering a phone call in a meeting 'unacceptable'

Co-author of the study, Peter W. Cardon warned discourteous behaviour in the workplace can have real implications for careers, hiring and even workplace efficiency, with tension among coworkers harming productivity.

The study, by the USC Marshall School of Business and Howard University claims to be the first to provide an empirical baseline for how attitudes towards mobile phone use breaks down across gender, age and region in the U.S.

Published today in the journal Business Communication Quarterly, the research offers a baseline for how attitudes toward technology may change over time and serves as a guide to navigating social expectations around polite smartphone use, the researchers said.

Dr Cardon said: 'Hiring managers often cite courtesy as among the most important soft skills they notice.

'By focusing on civility, young people entering the workforce may be able to set themselves apart'

The study found that three out of four people said checking texts or emails was poor behaviour in business meetings, while 87 per cent termed answering a phone call in a meeting 'unacceptable'.

Even at more informal business lunches, 66 per cent of people thought writing a text and sending message is rude.

Men were nearly twice as likely as women to consider mobile phone use at a business lunch acceptable.

Women were touchier about phone behaviour at work: Almost 60 per cent of men said it was okay to check text messages at a power lunch, compared to a third of women who thought checking texts was appropriate

Almost 60 per cent of men said it was okay to check text messages at a power lunch, compared to a third of women who thought checking texts was appropriate.

Similarly, half of the men surveyed men said it was acceptable to answer a call at a power lunch, compared to just over a quarter of women.

Despite the casual reputation, professionals from the West Coast of the U.S. were less accepting of mobile phone use in meetings than people from the East Coast.

Higher-income professionals who took part in the study had less tolerance for smartphone use in business meetings than workers who earned less.

The scientists also said there seemed to be a dramatic age gap in opinions about mobile phone use at work.

Younger professionals were nearly three times as likely as older professionals to think tapping out a message over a business lunch is appropriate.

Two thirds people under 30 said texting or emailing was okay, compared to just 20 per cent of those aged 51 to 65.

People who frequently attend working lunches in a group of five could find that even having a phone on display is offending someone, as 20 per cent of professionals said simply having a phone out at a business lunch is rude.

Saying 'Excuse me' to take a call also did not spare people's feelings, according to the study, which found almost a third of people still found it to be rarely appropriate during informal lunch meetings.

With sample of more than 550 full-time working professionals in the U.S. the study claims to reveal what business professionals perceive as acceptable, courteous or rude use of mobile phones in the workplace.

The researchers first identified the most common grievances people had about smartphone use among their colleagues, including browsing the Internet and checking text messages.

They then asked working professionals earning at least $30,000 a year to identify which of these behaviours they considered acceptable and which ones are flat-out rude.

'Not surprisingly, millennials and younger professionals were more likely to be accepting of smartphone use, but they might be doing themselves a disservice,' Dr Cardon said.

'In many situations, they rely on those older than them for their career advancement,' he said.
