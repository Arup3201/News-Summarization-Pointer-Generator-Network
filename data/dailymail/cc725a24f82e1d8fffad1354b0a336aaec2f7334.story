Hero: SAS man John Thompson, pictured during an underwater training exercise, took part in the Iranian embassy siege and the Falklands War and is selling his impressive collection of medals

An SAS hero who took part in the infamous Iranian embassy siege and daring raids during the Falklands War is selling his medals.

Warrant Officer John Thompson, 69, says he only found out they were valuable after going on the ITV antiques programme Real Deal and now hopes to get £12,000 for them at auction next month.

The collection from his distinguished career includes one from the UN for his work in Cyprus
in the 1960s, General Service and Northern Ireland medals, a South 
Atlantic Medal and the Republic of Korea Service Medal.

But despite his television appearance, he should be better known for his bravery in battle.

During the 1980 siege of the Iranian embassy, six gunmen took 26 hostages, killed one and threw his body out of the building.

Mr Thompson was one of a SAS team flown into London by helicopter who then stormed the
building by abseiling from the roof in a successful rescue bid that 
killed five of the terrorists.

Thompson and one of his three colleagues from A squadron were sent to 
the front of building where they fired gas canisters into the embassy - 
and were pictured doing so.

He was also one of several brave troops used successfully to attack Argentine forces on the Falklands ahead of the main British assault in 1982.

Thompson was secretly dropped in a full three weeks before the full British army arrived, killing the enemy and passing on important information back to the UK without ever being detected.

For sale: John Thompson's medals (l-r) U.N Medal, Cyprus; General Service 1962 1 clasp; South Atlantic 1982, with rosette; Regular Army; Republic of Korea service medal

In action: SAS man John Thompson is shown here on the left outside the Iranian Embassy during the siege in 1980, where he fired in gas canisters

Incredibly he is also the only SAS man top take part in the dramatic siege in Kensington and operations in the South Atlantic after Argentina invaded the British Falkland Islands. 

His story came out after earlier this year he took some axe heads and other ancient artefacts he 
found while metal detecting to a TV valuation and at the last minute put
his own medals in his back pocket.

He was told by experts his finds would not get him on the programme but he then remembered he had his medals so offered them up instead.

Incredible: John was one of the men who led the siege of the Iranian embassy in London in 1980 after he and others entered the Kensington building after being dropped in by helicopter

Famous: The six day siege of the embassy was ended by the SAS after commandos, including John Thompson fired in gas canisters, pictured, and went on to kill five Iranian gunmen inside

A dealer offered him £10,000 pounds and said that if they went to auction the pair would split anything raised above that sum.

They are now to go under the hammer at the Dix Noonan Webb saleroom in London during a two day sale staring on September 12.

The father-of-two is now hoping for an unexpected windfall when his medals go for auction.

Thompson, who is originally from Liverpool and now lives in Anglesea, 
with his wife, said: 'I wasn’t intending to sell my medals until I went 
to an antiques programme.

Bravery: John Thompson was on the Falklands a full three weeks before Britain took them back from the Argentinians. Pictured here the Union flag flies over Port Howard, West Falkland for the first time in more than two months following occupation

'My daughter saw that Real Deal was filming in Bangor and I decided to 
take some of my finds from metal detecting. I had some bronze axe heads 
and spear heads.

'On the way out I put my medals in my back pocket, but I didn’t know why I did.

'On the programme the experts gave me valuations for the metal detecting
finds, but there was no way they were going to get me on TV.

Warrant Officer Thompson enlisted into the Royal Electrical 
Mechanical Engineers where he successfully completed his parachute training, and was eventually posted to Cyprus 
on New Year’s day 1964.

He was among the first British Paras to remove their red berets and 
exchange them for the light blue beret of the United Nations, when the 
UN took over responsibility. Thompson transferred to the Royal Army Ordnance Corps, Parachute Brigade, in 1969.

Five years later, in 1974, together with his Brigadier, he gained the
rare distinction of being presented at a parade with the Republic of 
Korea Service Medal after a year there.

In 1978 he successfully applied for and completed his SAS selection and was posted to Boat Troop, “A” Squadron.

In May 1980 Thompson was told he was required for a job at the Iranian embassy.The raid by 55 SAS men lasted 17 minutes and all but one of the terrorists were killed. One hostage was killed during the raid.

The following year Thompson moved to Boat Troop, “G” Squadron, which 
was fortuitous for an eager soldier because that squadron was sent to 
the Falklands.

Along with his colleagues, Thompson was dropped on the islands and full three weeks before the invasion.He risked his life gathering intelligence on the Argentinian troop movements and spent the conflict taking out enemy patrols.

'My daughter looked disappointed, then I remembered the medals and I got them out they made a lot of phone calls.

'They put me on and the dealer just kept putting thousands of pounds 
down on the table. I had no idea they would be worth anything like that.

'I don’t think I said anything, he just kept putting more money down until there was 9,000 pounds on the table.

'After that David Dickinson who hosts the show said we’d finish the deal
after lunch and then we agreed a price of 10,000 pounds. And if it sold
for more than that at auction we’d split the rest.

'I’ve decided to sell because my two children don’t want the medals and I’ll soon be 70.

'And as they say, if you don’t let your medals leave, you’ll leave you medals.

'And the money will be useful of course.'

Thompson said he was the only SAS operative to take part in the Iranian 
embassy siege and the Falklands because he switched squadron.

He said: 'We were on standby when the embassy siege happened and an MoD policeman said we were needed.

'I didn’t want to go because I was just leaving to watch Liverpool play 
in Birmingham in the third replay of the FA Cup semi final.

'I remember saying 'find somebody else', but in the end I was pleased I didn’t go because we lost 1-0 against Arsenal.'

Pierce Noonan, from the saleroom, said: 'There will be interest in these
medals because Thompson was at the Iranian embassy siege and the covert
intelligence gathering operations in the Falklands, which is unique.'

They are in huge demand from collectors because of the story they tell of an incredible SAS soldier’s life who was the only one at the Iranian siege and the Falklands.
