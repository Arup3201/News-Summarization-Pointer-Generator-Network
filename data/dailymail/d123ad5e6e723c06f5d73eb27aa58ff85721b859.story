Died in custody: Dave Herman was arrested in October in a sting operation and was awaiting pedophile charges when he had a fatal aneurysm

Herman was rushed to the hospital late Wednesday from the county jail after complaining of chest pains.

According to Agnifilo, he suffered a fatal aneurysm.

Herman had been living in St. Croix, where he was arrested in a sting operation at the airport in October on a charge he tried to transport a seven-year-old girl to the U.S. Virgin Islands for sex.

Herman had allegedly been awaiting the arrival a 36-year-old single mother with a young daughter that he thought he had been communicating with in multiple telephone and online conversations about arranging an illegal sexual encounters with the child.

According to prosecutors, Herman told the mother, 'I find girls that age incredibly sexy, soft, and their innocence is also a huge turn-on for me. Age six is the perfect time to start her being loved that way,' reports the New York Daily News.

Herman had pleaded not guilty to the federal charge, but was denied bail. Agnifilo had suggested that Herman was duped by an undercover police officer.

A spokeswoman for the U.S. Attorney for the District of New Jersey said they were moving to dismiss the charges, as is standard practice upon the death of a defendant.

Agnifilo said he hoped the case wouldn't overshadow Herman's legacy.

'Some would say he lived his last months under a legal cloud and that's true, but we should remember him for the decades he gave the gift of music to people,' Agnifilo said.

Herman was a pioneering rock disc jockey in the late 1960s and `70s, when he began experimenting with free-form rock music programming, something that was novel at the time on FM radio, according to Paul Heine, a senior editor at Inside Radio, an industry trade publication.

Herman worked at Philadelphia's WMMR, and later worked for decades as a morning DJ at New York City's WNEW, where he remained until 1998, Heine said.

'WNEW was one of the most watched stations in the country in its `70s heyday, and he was a cornerstone of the legendary rock radio air staff there,' Heine said.
