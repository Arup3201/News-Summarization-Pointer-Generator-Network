Chelsea hope new TV camera angles will help Eden Hazard escape with a three-match ban after his fracas with Swansea ball boy Charlie Morgan.

As the FA’s disciplinary chiefs examined the evidence - with a decision expected on Friday on whether Hazard will receive an extended ban - the focus sharpened on Morgan’s role in the ugly episode.

South Wales Police had been reluctant to become involved, but their hand was forced after three members of the public made complaints about the Chelsea winger’s tussle with Morgan at the Liberty Stadium.

The 17-year-old student is the son of
Martin Morgan - a Swansea director, the club’s biggest shareholder and,
with a £42million fortune, one of the financial forces behind their 
rise to the Barclays Premier League.

Not surprisingly, the Welsh club have 
decided to take no action against  Morgan Jnr, who retreated to the 
family’s £1.5m mansion in Carmarthenshire yesterday. As he did, many 
people inside football took Hazard’s side and criticised the teenager, 
who had boasted on Twitter before the Capital One Cup semi-final second 
leg how he was an expert at wasting time.

‘The king of all ball boys is back making his final appearance #needed #for #timewasting’ he posted.

His Twitter page also contains 
photographs of a millionaire lifestyle which includes first-class air 
travel, broken champagne bottles, designer labels and staggering bar 
bills.

It all supports the notion he may be 
the richest ball boy in the Barclays Premier League, the heir to a 
family fortune built on a travel business and boutique hotels who is 
even wealthier than many of the players.

Morgan has worked as a Swansea ball 
boy since he was 12 and said he had been called up by his father for 
Wednesday’s game because some of the regulars could not make it to the 
game because of the snow.

The ball came his way with 10 minutes 
to go and with Swansea still holding their 2-0 advantage from the first 
leg. He refused to hand it back to Hazard, rolling on to the ball and 
smothering it with his body until Hazard kicked it clear.

Chelsea claim another ball boy had 
appeared to be wasting time 10 minutes earlier. Hazard was again close 
to the action and remonstrated with the referee.

The FA’s disciplinary team spent 
yesterday studying replays of the incident from different camera angles,
including one which appears to show Hazard made fairly clean contact 
with the ball.

Footage shown at the time, together with the dramatic 
reaction of the teenager, suggested Hazard had administered a hefty boot
to Morgan’s ribs on the way to the ball.

Former Chelsea and Scotland winger Pat
Nevin branded Morgan’s actions ‘disgraceful and unacceptably brattish’,
and claimed the ball boy was ‘acting’ when he claimed to be hurt.

‘He’s
only got one job and that’s to give the ball back,’ Nevin told BBC 
Radio 5 Live. ‘And what does he do? He keeps the ball.’

Fulham manager Martin Jol said he 
would have done the same as Hazard. ‘I can see why he did it,’ said the 
Dutchman. ‘The boy shouldn’t lie on the ball and play rugby with it.’

Many professional footballers tweeted 
in support of the Chelsea player, with Michael Owen assailing Morgan’s 
reaction as ‘scandalous’.

Rather than basking in the glory of 
reaching their first major final after beating the European champions, 
Swansea were on the defensive yesterday. Vice-chairman Leigh Dineen 
said: ‘We don’t line up the ball boys and ask them to waste time.

'The 
boy went to pick up the ball and he fell over. He didn’t hold on to the 
ball for a minute. It happened over about 20 seconds.

'Had it been 2-0 to
Chelsea, I don’t think Hazard would have been anywhere near the ball. 
But I don’t think Hazard deliberately went to kick him.’

Swansea first-team coach Alan Curtis added: ‘We never gave them instructions to slow the game down. It’s never been the case.’

Hazard was sent off by referee Chris 
Foy for violent conduct, which will carry an automatic three-match ban, 
ruling the winger out of games against Brentford, Reading and Newcastle.

Shared: The teenager retweeted someone else's 
£120,000 receipt with the caption, 'This is huge time', and also let his
friends know about the good weather at his holiday destination

Chelsea do not intend to appeal but the FA can opt to pass the case on 
to an independent commission if they suspect three matches is 
insufficient punishment.

They were also gathering evidence from
the match officials and South Wales Police, and spoke to officials at 
Swansea to ascertain the ball boy’s version of events.

Chelsea hope the video, together with 
Hazard’s public apology immediately after the game and his previous 
record of good behaviour, can bring the case down on their side.

Morgan was invited into the visitors’ 
dressing room after the game and spoke to Hazard. They apologised to 
each other, according to Chelsea’s interim manager Rafa Benitez.

The 
ball boy and Swansea agreed they would not lodge a police complaint but 
the local force had three complaints from the public which they are 
obliged to follow.

Chelsea, meanwhile, will discipline 
Hazard according to their internal procedure and within the PFA limit of
two weeks’ wages, which would be a maximum of £340,000.

It was headline
news in his native Belgium. He became the most expensive Belgian 
footballer ever when he moved from Lille to Chelsea for £32m last year 
and was in touch with friends at home yesterday to insist he had done 
nothing wrong.

It is not his first brush with 
controversy. He was widely criticised when he was substituted after 60 
minutes in a Euro 2012 qualifier against Turkey.

Hazard stormed straight
down the tunnel and was later filmed eating a hamburger nearby when the
game was still going on.

Should Eden Hazard face long ban for ball boy kick?

This did nothing for his popularity 
but he does not have a reputation for a violent temper. Those who 
followed his career in France insisted the ball-boy incident was totally
out of character yet there was a warning from the Belgian FA.

Their chief executive Steven Martens 
said: ‘It is unfortunate and not something we are proud of. No football 
authority or person interested in football likes to see acts of violence
or lack of respect. It might have happened in the heat of the fire but 
professionals are expected to be able to control themselves.

‘I’m convinced Eden will realise that.
He is more than intelligent enough to understand that this is going to 
be a lesson learned for him.’
