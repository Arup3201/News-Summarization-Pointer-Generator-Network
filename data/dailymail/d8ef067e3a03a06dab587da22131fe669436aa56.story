Three minke whale carcasses lie on the deck of a Japanese ship in a picture which campaigners say proves the country is guilty of ‘medieval butchery’.

It was taken from a helicopter flown by activists in an area of the Southern Ocean designated a protected zone for whales.

Bob Brown, of the Sea  Shepherd organisation which clashes each year with Tokyo’s ships, said: ‘It’s just a gruesome, bloody, medieval scene  which has got no place in this modern world.’

This photograph of three dead minke whales was taken by anti-whaling campaigners after they allegedly caught the Japanese vessel inside an internationally-recognised sanctuary

Militant anti-whaling group Sea Shepherd says it spotted the Nisshin Maru sailing through the protected Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary during the annual whaling season

As the Sea Shepherd's helicopter flew above the Japanese ship, campaigners shot footage of the blood-streaked deck and the carcasses of three dead minke whales

Japanese ships catch and kill hundreds
 of whales in the Southern Ocean each year despite having agreed, under 
pressure from the US, to an international moratorium on commercial 
whaling.

They cite a 1946 treaty which they claim exempts hunting  the mammals for scientific research.

Mr
 Brown said Sea Shepherd boats had caught up with five of Japan’s 
whaling vessels and had photographed evidence of  their illegal 
activities inside the internationally recognised whale sanctuary – an 
area of 50million square kilometres surrounding Antarctica and close to 
Australian and New Zealand waters.

Sea Shepherd said that another whale, also believed to be a minke, was being butchered on board

The commercial hunting of whales is prohibited in the sanctuary, which was designated by the International Whaling Commission in 1994

Clashes between whale poachers and
 activists have become increasingly aggressive, with water cannon fired,
 ships colliding and protesters boarding one of the whaling vessels.

Activists have urged the Australian and New Zealand governments to take 
action.

Dr Brown said: 'There's 
three carcasses on the ship, a fourth carcass has been cut up. There's 
blood all over the place, meat being carted around on this factory ship 
deck, offal and innards being dumped in the ocean.'. 

New Zealand Foreign Minister Murray McCully denied whaling was taking place within his country's maritime jurisdiction, saying the site was considered international waters, as he condemned the 'pointless and offensive' practice.

'The New Zealand government has repeatedly called on Japan to end its whaling programme. We reiterate this message today,' he said.

Sea Shepherd said they had spotted the Japanese fleet today and captured evidence that four whales had been slaughtered, alleging the ships were found inside the sanctuary

Japan is allowed to catch the animals under a 'scientific research' loophole in the moratorium on whaling

Japan's fisheries agency said its programme was being conducted 'in line with a research plan submitted to the IWC'.

'We are not aware of the existence of a whaling sanctuary so we don't want to comment on their arguments,' an agency spokesman said of Brown's claims.

The Japanese foreign ministry said research whaling was 'not a violation or an abuse of a loophole in the international convention'.

'Quite the contrary, this is a legitimate right of the contracting party under Article VIII of the International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling,' it said.

Dr Brown described 'massive violence' against the whales, using grenade-tipped harpoons to catch them, and said Sea Shepherd would do 'all it peaceably can to prevent this grotesque and cruel destruction', also urging Australia and New Zealand to take action.

Japan's fisheries agency said its programme was being conducted 'in line with a research plan submitted to the IWC'

Peter Hammarstedt, captain of the Sea Shepherd ship Bob Barker, said Japan had shown 'flagrant disregard for international law' by continuing whaling

'There is nothing scientific about this, it is butchery,' Dr Brown said.

'The one thing that's missing here is gumption - a bit of spine in Canberra and in Wellington to put an end to it.'

Australia has taken Japan to the International Court of Justice seeking to have its research whaling programme declared illegal, with a ruling due this year.

Peter Hammarstedt, captain of the Sea Shepherd ship Bob Barker, said Japan had shown 'flagrant disregard for international law by continuing their illegal whale hunt while the world patiently awaits a decision from the International Court of Justice'.

Sea Shepherd left Australia for their 10th annual harassment campaign of the Japanese fleet last month, sending three ships to tail and run interference against the harpooners.

High-seas clashes between the two groups are common, resulting in the 2010 sinking of the Sea Shepherd vessel Ady Gil.

Australia will be monitoring confrontations between the pair from a government jet which is due to fly surveillance missions over the Southern Ocean between January and March.

However, Dr Brown said there had so far been no sign of the aircraft.
