Almost half of white boys from poorer homes are leaving primary school unable to read a book, according to a new literacy campaign.

They are among about 130,000 UK children who leave each year with a sub-standard reading level, a study from Read On. Get On found.

Researchers said a quarter of 11-year-olds in the poorest families had fewer than ten books in  their homes.

Worryingly, the most commonly read material by children was text messages, although ebooks were growing in popularity.

Overall, 40 per cent of children from poorer backgrounds leave primary school not reading as well as they should – among boys this figure rises to 45 per cent. Boys are twice as likely as girls to fall below even a very basic reading level – one of the biggest differences on this measure in the developed world.

Between the strongest and weakest readers, the gap is roughly equivalent to seven years’ schooling. In the EU only Romania has a wider gap in this area.  

Experts behind the report claim around 1.5 million children are in danger of being left behind by 2025 unless things improve.

Authors including JK Rowling and Michael Morpurgo plus a host of book publishers and the CBI are among those backing the campaign, which is spearheaded by charity Save the Children.

One aim is to get the major political parties to commit to improving the reading of the most disadvantaged in their manifestos for next year’s general election.

The research found low-income, white British boys were particularly likely to fall behind, with 45 per cent unable to read well by the age of 11. Reading well is defined as being able to read and understand books, websites, newspapers and magazines.

Researchers found youngsters  who were already behind in reading when they left primary school continued to struggle through their secondary education.

The report also found England has the strongest link between illiteracy and unemployment of any developed country. The UK’s gross domestic product could be 2.1 per cent higher by 2025 – a staggering £32billion in monetary terms – if all children read well by age 11, it claims.

Poor literacy is linked to unemployment, low pay and even crime. Around one in four people earning less than £10,000 is not functionally literate – compared with fewer than one in 25 for those earning over £30,000.

At the same time, MPs on the Commons Business Select Committee also warned that an ‘alarmingly high’ proportion of adults do not have a good grasp of reading, writing and maths, and urgent action is needed to tackle the issue.

The committee said those who struggled the most with literacy and numeracy were not getting the help they need.

The committee argued that while the Government has pledged free training and tuition for any adult who wants to study English and maths up to GCSE, those with the most limited skills in these core areas were not aware that this support is available.

Committee chairman Adrian Bailey said: ‘Problems with reading, writing and maths have a huge impact on people’s daily lives, including getting and keeping a job, understanding bills, forms and documents, and guiding children through education.

‘It can affect adults in many walks of life, but it also undermines the economic performance of our country.’
