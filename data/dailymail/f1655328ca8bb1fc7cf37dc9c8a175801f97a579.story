Emily Fox was jailed for 15 months for her relationship with the teenage girl 

A lesbian PE teacher at a leading private school was jailed for 15 months yesterday for sex acts with a girl of 15.

Emily Fox, 26, exchanged hundreds of ‘sexually explicit’ messages with the girl.

The pair struck up a friendship in late 2012 but from Easter last year developed an intense bond that involved kissing and later sexual touching, a court heard.

Fox was a teacher at the Royal Masonic School for Girls in Rickmansworth, Hertfordshire – where fees are up to £25,000 a year.

The relationship was discovered in August last year when a revealing email was printed inadvertently and seen by the parents of the victim, who cannot be named for legal reasons.

Fox, from Bath, last month admitted four counts of engaging in sexual activity with a child while in a position of trust.

The first count related to ‘touching by kissing’, the rest to more intimate touching.

Sally Mealing-McLeod, prosecuting, told St Albans Crown Court that contact between the pair began in November 2012.

She said: ‘Initially it was what one could really call a friendship. However, that changed around Easter 2013 and ... became far more intense.’

The prosecutor said the girl told the teacher ‘she loved her as a friend’.

She said the matter came to light when the victim tried to print an email but the printer did not work.

The prosecutor said: ‘A week later the father was using the printer when that document was printed. It clearly disclosed some sort of relationship.’

The prosecutor said an ‘abundance’ of evidence to support the charges was discovered in WhatsApp messages between the pair, including ones that were sexually explicit.

‘There are hundreds and hundreds of those messages,’ she added.

Dee Connelly, mitigating, said Fox had shown bravery in admitting the offences. She had wanted to be a teacher from a young age and accepts her career is now ruined.

Fox took an overdose in 2011 and suffered depression after her parents moved to America, the court heard.

Judge Stephen Gullick told Fox he had no doubt she was a gifted teacher. But he said: ‘You were always aware that the relationship was not only wrong but also unlawful.’ He said that this type of behaviour was ‘extremely grave’.

Fox, 26, (pictured left and right) had been teaching at the school for two years before striking up a friendship with the teenager. She was sentenced to 15 months in prison at court yesterday after earlier pleading guilty to various counts of engaging in sexual activity with a child while in a position of trust

Fox dabbed tears from her eyes as she sat in the dock. She shrugged to her parents as she left the court.
