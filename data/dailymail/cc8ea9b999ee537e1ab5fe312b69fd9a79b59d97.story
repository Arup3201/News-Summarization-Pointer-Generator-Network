Packs of wild boar are hunting newborn lambs in Britain, experts say.

The Forest of Dean, Gloucestershire, has about 800 boar which usually feed only on plants and dead animals.

But in recent weeks, groups have reportedly killed four lambs. Clare Harvey, a vet, saw six boar eat a lamb near the village of Lydbrook.

She said: ‘It was quite brutal, with the carcass already having been skinned and the piglets tearing it limb from limb. 

'We know pigs are omnivores and devour carrion, but this suggested they may have developed a taste for fresh meat. 

'There are serious implications for animal health and the spread of disease.’

The Forestry Commission said it had heard three further reports of the animals killing and eating lambs in Bream, Parkend and Yorkley, Gloucestershire.

In recent weeks, boar have reportedly killed four lambs.

In a fourth incident a boar ate a ewe and its still-born lamb - though it is not known if they were both already dead.  

A spokesman for the Forestry Commission said: 'They are a large free-roaming animal, and they are an omnivore, and they can get rather large.

'I suspect if you spoke to a large mammal expert it would come as no surprise that large animals that eat both meat and vegetation, maybe is doing this.

'It is something we have heard is happening, from second or third hand accounts, but it is not something that any of our guys have seen.' 

Wild boar became extinct in England 300 years ago, but have been reintroduced through escapes and deliberate releases. The Forest of Dean group is the country’s largest.
