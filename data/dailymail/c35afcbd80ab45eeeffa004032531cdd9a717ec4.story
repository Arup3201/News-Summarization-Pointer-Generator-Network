Airlines made multi-billion pound profits last year, charging passengers for an array of extra services, from on-flight food to paying tickets by credit card.

Travel companies charged their customers almost £18billion in 2012, a sum which has doubled in just three years.

The worst - or most clever - airline, Australian long-haul flight-company Qantas, charged an average of £37 per passenger in extras alone, industry figures reveal.

Contrary to its reputation as an airline which charges extra for all things possible, Ryanair only made £11 per customer last year, and it is in fact the big-name companies that rake in the cash.

Although many airlines now charge to reserve a seat or print a boarding pass, a majority of the revenue comes from the big up-sells such as selling extra miles or upgrades to frequent fliers and commission on car rentals and hotels.

The figures comes from the annual research by analysts IdeaWorks who study the revenue records of the 53 airlines which disclose how much they make from ancilliary revenue.

In some cases the airlines publish every detail about what they make and where, in others they simply put in the final figure without explaining where it all comes from.

Worldwide, the biggest earners are Qantas which earns nearly £37 per passenger in extras alone.

The European league, with its shorter flights, make slightly less, with the highest earner, budget airline Jet2Com making £30 per person, followed by Virgin Atlantic with £20 a passenger.

Amount made in extras, per passenger, 2012:

1. Jet2.com - £30.152. Virgin Atlantic - £20.053. Aer Lingus - £15.694. Flybe - £14.325. easyJet - £12.9366. Ryanair - £11.527. Air France - £10.248. Norwegian - £9.229 .Vueling - £6.8910. Aeroflot - £6.38

Ryanair is sixth in the European league table though it has so many passengers and such low overheads that extras make up 22 per cent of its income.

The amount made by airlines around the world in extras has increased by more than tenfold since 2008 alone, said the company. Only 23 airlines had caught on to the possibilities then.

IdeaWorks said: ‘It has become a crucial component of airline income.

‘Carriers worldwide rely upon the revenue from frequent flier activities, a la carte features, and commission-based products, to create profits in an era of high fuel costs while keeping fares modest in a recession-weary world.'
