Getting fatter: A new report has revealed there is only one U.S. state with an obesity rate below 20 per cent

A fifth of the population in all but one state is obese, according to a shocking new report released today.

America has become dramatically fatter in the last five years alone - in 2005 just one state had an obesity rate of more than 30 per cent, but today a dozen do.

The fattest state is Mississippi, where 34.4 per cent of adults are obese, and Colorado is the only state where fewer than one fifth of the population falls into that category.

But the obesity rate there, in the 'thinnest' state, is still 19.8 per cent, which in 1995 would have made in the fattest state.

The
figures, for 2010, were released today in 'F as in Fat', an annual report from the
Trust for America's Health and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

No state decreased its level of obesity,
which is defined as a body mass index of 30 or more. The body mass 
index is a measurement based on weight and height.

Even Colorado does not 
win high marks -- its score means one in five state residents is at 
higher risk for conditions like heart disease and diabetes.

States with highest obesity rates

1. Mississippi - 34.4 per cent

2. Alabama - 32.3 per cent

3. West Virginia - 32.2 per cent

4. Tennessee - 31.9 per cent

5. Louisiana - 31.6 per cent

6. Kentucky - 31.5 per cent

7. 
Oklahoma - 31.4 per cent

8. South Carolina - 30.9 per cent

9. Arkansas - 30.6 per cent

10.
Michigan -  30.5 per cent 

The worst offenders are in the south. Mississippi tops the list for the seventh year in a row, with Alabama, West Virginia, Tennessee and Louisiana close behind.

At the other end of the scale, Colorado, District of Columbia, Connecticut, Massachusetts and Hawaii are the 'thinnest' states.

Since 1995, the first time data was available for every state, obesity rates have doubled in seven states and increased by at least 90 per cent in ten others.

Rates have grown fastest in Oklahoma, Alabama, and Tennessee, and slowest in Washington D.C., Colorado, and Connecticut.

Jeffrey Levi, the executive director of the Trust for America's Health, said: 'When you look at it year by year, the changes are incremental. When you look at it by a generation you see how we got into this problem.'

There was some good news for high-profile anti-obesity activists including Michelle Obama, whose Let's Move campaign aims to reduce childhood weight problems.

This year 16 states reported increases in their obesity rates, down from 28 last year.

States with lowest obesity rates

1. Colorado - 19.8 per cent

2. Washington D.C. - 21.7 per cent

3. Connecticut - 21.8 per cent

4. Massachusetts - 22.3 per cent

5. Hawaii - 23.1 per cent

6. Utah - 23.4 per cent

7. Vermont - 23.5 per cent

8. Montana - 23.8 per cent

9. New Jersey - 24.1 per cent

10. Rhode Island - 24.3 per cent

Mr Levi said: 'We're levelling off to some degree at an unacceptably high level.'

He said increases have been gradually slowing as a result of greater public awareness on health issues, along with government initiatives to give schools better access to healthier foods.

As in previous years, the study showed that racial and ethnic minorities have the highest obesity rates.

In 15 states, more than 40 per cent of African-American adults are obese, while the obesity rate for white people was higher than 30 per cent in just four states.

Education also has a dramatic effect on obesity rates.

About a third of adults who did not graduate from high school are obese, compared to a fifth of college graduates.

Dr Mary Currier, Mississippi's health officer, says the state has struggled to drop its status as the country's status because so many areas are poor and rural.

She said: 'We live in an area of the country where eating is one of the things we do, and we eat a lot of fried foods. Trying to change that culture is pretty difficult.'
