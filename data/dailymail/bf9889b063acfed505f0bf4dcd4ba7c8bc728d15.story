Police swung into action when they received a phonecall telling them youths had been seen shouting at sheep.

A community support officer from the cash-strapped Wiltshire force reached the scene within 30 minutes but found the sheep unharmed and no sign of the youths or the woman who had phoned.

She had told police she was walking in the village of Collingbourne Ducis, near Salisbury Plain, when she saw four youths, aged 12 to 14, yelling at sheep and making them run across a field.

A police spokeswoman defended the decision to send an officer, saying farmers lose livestock every year in incidents involving people whose dogs kill or maim sheep.

‘It was one of many incidents we were attending that day – not all sheep related,’ she added.

Wiltshire Police face large cuts and by 2017 they will have to cut 25 per cent of their budget, reducing it by £12 million and losing 173 officers.

Collingbourne parish council chairman Keith Cockerton said: ‘It is every person’s right to call the police if they feel the law is being broken.’
