Abu Hamza saw violence as necessary to defend Muslims and saw physical training for jihad as an obligation for all Muslim men, a court heard on Wednesday.

James Ujaama, a U.S.-based associate of Hamza, told jurors in the New York court that the Islamist cleric had instructed him to set up a jihadist training camp in the U.S.

U.S. prosecutors hope Ujaama's testimony will convince a federal jury that the preacher is guilty of trying to set up the camp to aid al Qaeda.

The charges against him carry a potential life sentence.

Facing life in jail: Islamist cleric Abu Hamza pictured in a court sketch at the Federal Court in Lower Manhattan, New York, where he is on trial for allegedly setting up terrorist training camps in the U.S.

One-eyed, handless Hamza, 56, is also accused of supporting al Qaeda in Afghanistan and of providing assistance to militants who kidnapped 16 Western tourists in Yemen in 1998.

Four of the hostages were killed during a rescue operation.

Hamza's lawyers have argued that he used inflammatory rhetoric but did not commit any crimes.

The court saw a copy of a fax that Ujaama sent to Hamza, then a preacher at London's Finsbury Park mosque, telling him about a ranch in Oregon where he hoped to set up the training camp.

'The land that we spoke of is about 160 acres and looks just like Afghanistan,' Ujaama said in the fax.

He added that Oregon was a 'pro-militia and firearms state' where it would be easy to stockpile weapons for combat training.

Ujaama, who pleaded guilty in 2003 to conspiring to aid the Taliban, appeared as part of a cooperation deal with prosecutors and is expected to remain on the witness stand for several days.

As a former associate of Hamza, Ujaama is a key government witness. His testimony is expected to cover not only Oregon but the allegation that Abu Hamza sent a man to Afghanistan to receive military training with al Qaeda.

Ujaama said he first met the fiery preacher in London in 1998, shortly after returning from a trip to Afghanistan where he attended training camps with religious extremists.

The two men discussed Islamic teachings over tea and cookies at Abu Hamza's second-floor office at the Finsbury Park mosque, Ujaama said.

'I walked away from that meeting very impressed with Sheikh Abu Hamza,' Ujaama was quoted as saying by the Associated Press.

Soon after, Ujaama was working for Abu Hamza, writing and publishing articles online for an organization called Supporters of Sharia run by the preacher.

One piece - titled 'A Declaration of War' - summarised Osama bin Laden's call to take up arms against the U.S., Ujaama said.

'Was Abu Hamza overseeing you when you posted this statement?' asked Assistant U.S. Attorney John Cronan.

'Yes, he was,' Ujaama replied.

In 1999, Ujaama said, the two men arrived in Oregon from the United Kingdom and were disappointed to find that Ujaama's camp did not have many weapons or recruits.

Ujaama said he was threatened by one of the men, Oussama Kassir, who claimed to be a former bodyguard for Osama bin Laden.

In the coming days, Ujaama is also expected to testify that Abu Hamza ordered him in 2000 to take another man, Feroz Abbasi, to Afghanistan to seek out training with al Qaeda.

Egyptian-born Hamza lost his hands and one eye in Afghanistan in the 1980s.

A British court convicted him 2006 of inciting followers to violence and he served six years in prison before his extradition to the U.S. in 2012.
