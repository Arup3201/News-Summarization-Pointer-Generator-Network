Yesterday saw male models strut the catwalk in tie dye, giant roll necks and crop tops but it seems the designers have upped the ante on the second day of London Collections: Men.

Today, heavy hitting designers such as J.W. Anderson and Christopher Raeburn showcased their AW14 offerings and fashion was taken to new heights - literally.

That's right, male models donned chunky block platforms complete with heels at J.W. Anderson's almost feminine show today.

'We're seeing prints, male platform 
shoes, blouson jackets and the most beautiful camel coat,' said GQ 
retail editor Giorgina Waltier of the show.

Nick Carvell of GQ said: 'The high heels might be for a select few, but the camel overcoat is a classic no matter your style', while fashion blogger Jay Young added: 'I'm all for experimental men's fashion but these shoes are truly atrocious. I'll stick to the classic styles thanks.'

'With another collection steeped with androgynous overtones, some of us are left thinking: "OK Jonathan, we get it" however that doesn't stop him playing with gender and proportions.

'He showed more of his off the shoulder numbers, hyper floral prints and clogs. There was some uber ribbed pieces and bandage like, paper thin knits, tripled up for added texture. Super fashion, but can it sell?,' mused fashion blogger Simon Glazin of www.theverysimong.com.

Accessories came in the form of a leather handbag styled as a workman's bucket, while rolls of gaffer tape were worn as bangles.

Jonathan Saunders yesterday
 confirmed that layered-up bombers are going to be bang on trend next 
season and Christopher Raeburn gave the garment an extra seal of approval in today's show.

With many designers this season heading back towards the fashion 
industry's ever controversial penchant for fur, an equal number headed 
in a new and interesting direction with a teddy bear coat offering.

Kim Kardashian and Alexa Chung have already been donning theirs and it seems the men of the world are keen to jump on the trend.

'This season is about all things Arctic,' Christopher Raeburn told GQ.

Simon Glazin commented: 'If there's 
anyone who can keep you warm for next season, it's Christopher Raeburn. 
With his arctic and Polaris inspirations, his outerwear remains 
stylishly practical. And watch out for the standout full shearling 
pieces...Teddy bear chic!'

Suave: Crisp tailoring and muted colours were the order of the day at Richard James. 'Dream biker jackets, racing green and sparkly suits (not all at once)' mused Nick Grimshaw

best is yet to come - over the next two days, we’ll see seasonal 
offerings from big hitters Alexander McQueen and Burberry (which FEMAIL

And
 with fashion week comes super-fashionable parties. On Sunday night Domenico 
Dolce and Stefano Pilati kicked off the week in style at their Bond 
Street store where Kylie Minogue danced the night away.

Mulberry
 and Tommy Hilfiger are hot tickets for the week and Superdry will be 
hosting the biggest party of LC:M, which will include a catwalk show 
showing both men's and women's collections followed by a star-studded 
party hosted by man of the moment Nick Grimshaw tonight.

The
London event sees 60 menswear 
designers showcase their wares for the coming season in front of 
assembled press, stylish celebrities and buyers from over 45 countries - and is a showcase 
for what is a £6.5bn fashion industry.
