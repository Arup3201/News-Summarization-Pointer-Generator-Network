The glamorous side of Charlene of Monaco is back in the spotlight courtesy of a stunning new exhibition.

The royal, who is believed to have welcomed her twins this morning - a boy and a girl - stars in a series of portraits by Julian Lennon, son of the Beatle John and his first wife Cynthia.

The photographs, all of which were taken in the days leading up to her 2011 wedding, are titled 'Charlene Wittstock', and features 19 black and white snaps, among them a series of intimate shots of the now-princess having her make-up and hair done.

Striking: Julian Lennon's portraits of Princess Charlene were taken ahead of her 2011 wedding

The striking pre-wedding photos, which have gone on show at the ArtCube Gallery in Paris, aren't the only time rock and real royalty have come together.

May 2013 saw the princess and the photographer mingle in a more sociable environment when the two both attended a glamorous yacht party during the Cannes Film Festival.

Charlene, who looked every inch the Hollywood star in a tailored black jumpsuit, happily posed for photos with Lennon as she boarded the yacht and earlier as both stepped onto the red carpet at the LOVA World Images Exhibition.

Gorgeous though she looked, it is Lennon's softly-lit images of the princess that really catch the eye, offering a snapshot of royal wedding preparations and an unusually relaxed Charlene. 

Beautiful: The softly-lit black and white shots show the South African royal looking impossibly glamorous

Resemblance: In several of the photos, Charlene bears a strong resemblance to the late Grace Kelly

Joyous: One striking shot shows Charlene beaming broadly as she enjoys a glass of champagne

In one gorgeous photo, the 35-year-old bears a striking resemblance to her mother-in-law Grace Kelly, staring towards the camera as her hair is pinned into soft curls.

In another, she smiles broadly and raises a glass of champagne, clearly excited at the prospect of exchanging vows with now-husband Prince Albert.

The princess, who was last seen on the balcony of the Palais Princier in Monaco during the country's National Day celebrations in November, is believed to have welcomed her twin babies - a boy and a girl - this morning.  

According to local reports, the princess was admitted to the Princess Grace hospital this morning, where she delivered the twins by caesarian section.

The babies are the first children born to the 36-year-old South African and her 56-year-old husband Prince Albert II, although he has two children born during earlier relationships. 

It is thought that Charlene knew the sex of the twins, while Prince Albert had asked to be kept in the dark until the babies are born.

The children are already unusual given the rarity of royal twins, in Europe and elsewhere.

In the UK, only one set of royal twins has ever been born - to King James I of Scotland and his wife Joan Beaufort in 1430.

Elsewhere in Europe, twins are more common with Georg Friedrich, Prince of Prussia, and his wife Princess Sophie of Isenberg producing a pair of twin boys last year. 

Also parents to twins are Crown Prince Frederik of Denmark and his wife Mary, who welcomed Prince Vincent and Princess Josephine into their family in 2011.

Prince Louis Alphonse, Duke of Anjou is yet another royal father of twins, and was with his wife Maria Margarita Vargas Santaella when she gave birth to Prince Louis, Duke of Burgundy and Prince Alphonse, Duke of Berry in 2010.
