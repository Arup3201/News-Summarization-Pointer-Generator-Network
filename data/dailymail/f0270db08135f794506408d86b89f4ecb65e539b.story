A person with access to a gun is three times more likely to commit suicide and nearly twice as likely to be a murder victim as someone who does not have access, a new study warns.

Researchers at the University of California, San Francisco, drew the conclusion after analysing 15 studies about the relationship between gun ownership and violence.

Men and women, they found, are affected in different ways.

A University of California study has shown that having a gun in the home can greatly increase murder and suicide rates

When firearms were accessible, men were nearly four times more likely to commit suicide than when firearms were not accessible, while women were almost three times more likely to be victims of homicide.

Gun ownership in America is higher than anywhere else in the world and firearms cause an estimated 31,000 deaths each year.

Lead researcher and U.S. Army veteran Dr Andrew Anglemyer believes that the more access to weapons people have, the more violent society becomes.

Gun ownership in the U.S. is higher than any other country in the world

He said: ‘Our analysis shows that having access to firearms is a significant risk factor for men committing suicide and for women being victims of homicide. Since empirical data suggest that most victims of homicide know their assailants, the higher risk for women strongly indicates domestic violence.’

Firearms play a significant role in both suicide and homicide, accounting for slightly more than half of all suicide deaths and two-thirds of homicide deaths, according to 2009 data from the 16-state National Violent Death Reporting System, which is run by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

About 75 per cent of suicides occur in the victims' homes, and a similar percentage of female homicide victims die in their homes. The figure is about 45 per cent for men.

All but two of the studies were done in the United States and the results of the UCSF study was published in the Annals of Internal Medicine.

David Hemenway of the Harvard School of Public Health, in an Annals editorial accompanying the feature on the study, underlined the dangers of having a gun in the home.

He wrote: ‘Why having a gun in the home would substantially increase the risk for being murdered by a person who is not a family member is uncertain, and Anglemyer and colleagues do not provide an explanation.

‘Obtaining a firearm not only endangers those living in the home but also imposes substantial costs on the community.’

The Smith & Wesson's new monster handgun

The study on gun violence was released shortly after Smith & Wesson unveiled its new monster handgun - the so-called 'Backpack Cannon'.

It's a .460-caliber revolver clearly built for those looking to tap into their inner Clint Eastwood or Hellboy.

Smith & Wesson claim that it's the ideal gun for carrying around in your backpack and is a great addition to a hunting party that's targeting wild pigs or boar.

And useful for fending off 'critters big enough to eat you'.

The new gun, unveiled at the annual SHOT show in Las Vegas, costs $1,200.
