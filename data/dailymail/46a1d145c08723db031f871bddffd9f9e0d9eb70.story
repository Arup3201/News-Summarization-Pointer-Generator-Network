The Government has again attacked the BBC for sexist sports coverage after presenter Colin Murray said Olympic gold medallist Jessica Ennis-Hill had the ultimate bottom.

A capacity crowd at the Olympic Stadium were left shocked by Murray's comments just weeks after John Inverdale said Wimbledon champion Marion Bartoli 'was never going to be a looker'.

After Inverdale's gaffe Culture Secretary Maria Miller delivered an extraordinary attack on the BBC in a letter to Director General Tony Hall, and now looks set to write to him again.

Controversial: Rather than mentioning her athleticism Colin Murray complimented male stars on their speed and stamina, but concentrated on Jessica Ennis-Hill's bottom

Colin Murray had been given the job of geeing up the crowd at the Anniversary Games in the Olympic Stadium.

Demand for action: Maria Miller wants further action taken by the BBC to tackle sexism after John Inverdale and Colin Murray's comments

The 36-year-old told the 80,000 people there that the ultimate athlete would have: 'The stamina of Mo (Farah), the speed of (Usain) Bolt, the leap of (Greg) Rutherford and the bottom of Jess Ennis'.

Although his comments were not broadcast it led to a row on Twitter where the Northern Irish presenter was accused of sexism and living in the 1950s.

Ian Jackson wrote: 'Sexism in sport alive & well. Apparently Jess Ennis just has good bum. Shame on Colin Murray.'

Julie Haigh tweeted: 'Boys get their skills mentioned, but @J_Ennis has her bum mentioned. In the 50s are we?'

Natalie Vincent added: '@ColinMurray You serious? Colin, did the Inverdale debacle not teach you ANYTHING?'

He then tweeted to say: 'Hey guys, I said she was the "greatest all-round athlete in the 
world"'.

But Maria Miller is said to be hopping-mad about the incident.

'Tony Hall claimed the Inverdale incident was a one-off and had been dealt with but we have seen other occurrences including this one at the Anniversary Games, which clearly underlines the need for positive action on this issue,' a source close to Ms Miller told the Independent.

A spokesman for the Department of Culture, Media and Sport added: "Maria Miller has been clear she wants to see more media coverage of top women's sport, more women on sports boards and more women participating at the grassroots. Recent sexist comments from high-profile commentators focusing on sportswomen's appearances rather than their sporting prowess are unacceptable and show that there is still much work to be done.'

Colin Murray has been described as a 'Marmite' broadcaster - as people either love him or hate him.

The freelance presenter has quit Radio 5 Live for talkSPORT a month after BBC bosses had to apologise when his weekly Fighting Talk show included a section on how openly gay presenter Clare Balding could be ‘turned around’.
