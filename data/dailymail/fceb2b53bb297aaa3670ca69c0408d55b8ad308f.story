A four-year-old Israeli boy has been killed by rocket fire from Gaza today - the fourth Israeli civilian to be killed in the latest round of the conflict.

The boy died just before sundown in the village of Nahal Oz near the Gaza border after the rocket struck a kibbutz - or communal farm - where he lived.

Charred vehicles were seen where the shell landed. The latest death in the conflict prompted harsh words from Israeli prime minister Bejamin Netanyahu, who vowed that Hamas would pay a 'heavy price' for the attack.

It came as violence in Gaza itself intensified, with Hamas killing 18 people whom it described as Israeli spies. Six of the alleged informants were lined up behind a mosque and shot dead after midday prayers.

The
 Hamas-run website Al Rai suggested the killings were in retaliation for the deaths of three high-ranking military leaders killed in an Israeli air strike yesterday.

It portrayed the killings as the
 beginning of a new crackdown, under the rallying cry of 'choking the 
necks of the collaborators.'

The executions came as Israeli rescue officials said a four-year-old boy was killed in a mortar attack near the border with the Gaza Strip.

Six of the alleged spies were grabbed from among hundreds of worshippers leaving the city's largest mosque, by men in the uniform of Hamas's military wing, the Ezzedine al-Qassam Brigades.

One of the masked men shouted: 'This is the final moment of the Zionist enemy collaborators' then the gunmen sprayed them with bullets.

Earlier, another witness saw 11 people
 shot dead in a square near the remains of Gaza police headquarters, 
which had been bombed by Israeli warplanes.

An 18th person was shot in front of bystanders in a separate incident nearby.

Two
 of those killed were women, according to the Palestinian Center for 
Human Rights, which called for an immediate halt to what it said were 
'extra-judicial executions.'

A Gaza security official said the suspected informants were killed after they had previously been sentenced by Gaza courts.

Al Rai, however, said they were killed after the completion of 'legal procedures', suggesting a hastily arranged hearing.

The
 killings marked the third time since the outbreak of the Gaza war six 
weeks ago that Hamas has announced the killing of alleged collaborators.

On Thursday, it said seven people had been arrested and that three of them had been killed on suspicion of working with Israel.

In pinpointing the whereabouts of the Hamas commanders, Israel likely relied to some extent on local informers.

Israel
 has maintained a network of informers despite its withdrawal from Gaza 
in 2005, at times using blackmail or the lure of exit permits to win 
co-operation.

Meanwhile, a rocket fired from Gaza hit a synagogue in the Israeli city of Ashdod on Friday, wounding three people, police said.

'There is damage at the scene and a number of people were injured by shrapnel,' police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said.

The attack came shortly before evening prayers ahead of the Jewish Sabbath. Ashdod is around 30 km (20 miles) from Gaza.

Earlier, an Israeli airstrike on a Gaza farm killed two Palestinians today, a Gaza health official said, as fighting continued for a third day after the collapse of Egyptian-led cease-fire talks.

The renewed exchanges have dashed hopes for a lasting truce after a month-long war that has already killed over 2,000 people.

By
 mid morning Friday, Israel had launched about 20 airstrikes at Gaza, 
while Gaza militants fired two rockets at Israel, the Israeli military 
said.

Earlier this week, 
Hamas rejected an Egyptian truce proposal under which Israel would 
gradually ease its blockade of Gaza, without giving specific 
commitments.

Hamas demands a lifting of the border 
closure, imposed by Israel and Egypt after the militant group's takeover
 of the coastal strip in 2007.

A
 quick resumption of indirect talks between Israel and Hamas in Cairo 
seems unlikely, particularly after Israel killed three top Hamas 
military leaders in an airstrike Thursday.

Yesterday, thousands of Palestinians marched 
through Gaza today firing guns, waving flags of different militant 
groups and chanting religious slogans in a funeral procession for the three leaders.

The
 bodies of Mohammed Abu Shamaleh, Mohammed Barhoum and Raed al-Attar 
were carried aloft through the crowd on stretchers wrapped in green 
Hamas flag before being buried in a cemetery.

Since
 Israel-Hamas fighting erupted on July 8, at least 2,086 Palestinians 
were killed, according to Gaza health official Ashraf al-Kidra.

Nearly a quarter of the dead - 469 - are children, according to the top UNICEF field officer in Gaza, Pernilla Ironside.

Of
 the more than 10,400 Palestinians wounded, nearly a third are children,
 according to UNICEF figures, while some 100,000 Gazans have been left 
homeless.

Responding
 to their deaths, senior Hamas political leader Ismail 
Haniyeh said late Thursday that his group would not budge from its 
demands.

'We will not 
accept anything less than an end to the (Israeli) aggression and an end 
to the blockade,' Haniyeh said in a statement posted by the 
Hamas-affiliated Al Rai news service.

'Anyone involved in cease-fire efforts must understand that our people will not accept anything less than this.'

On the Israeli side, 67 people have been killed in the past six weeks, including 64 soldiers, two civilians and a Thai worker.

One of Friday's airstrikes hit a livestock farm where two workers were killed, al-Kidra said.

Three Palestinains were wounded in that strike.

The Israeli military said its strikes targeted concealed rocket launchers and weapons sites.

Israel said the three Hamas senior figures killed on Thursday had played a key role in expanding the militants' military capabilities in recent years, including digging attack tunnels leading to Israel, training fighters and smuggling weapons to Gaza.

One of the trio also played a role in the capture of Israeli soldier Gilad Schalit in 2006.

After being held captive in Gaza for more than five years, Schalit was exchanged for more than 1,000 Palestinian prisoners in 2011.

Israel says the Gaza blockade is needed to prevent Hamas and other militant groups from getting weapons.

The restrictions prevent most Gazans from traveling outside the crowded coastal strip and bar most exports.
