Ebola victim: American finance consultant Patrick Sawyer, who died in Nigeria, with daughter Ava

British airports and airlines are on high alert to prevent the deadly Ebola virus from reaching this country.

Passengers thought to have the virus will be barred from boarding flights heading to the UK – and will be held at immigration if they appear ill on arrival.

They will then be quarantined in highly secure isolation units, such as those at the Royal Free Hospital in North London.

But because it takes up to three weeks for symptoms to appear, there are fears some victims will slip through the net.

Doctors have been told to look out for symptoms of the disease and travellers returning from West Africa are urged to seek immediate medical help if they develop flu-like symptoms.

One of the deadliest diseases known to man, Ebola has already claimed more than 670 lives in its worst-ever outbreak.

For the first time, the virus, which kills up to 90 per cent of its victims, has spread out of the countryside to large towns and cities, raising fears it will arrive in Britain on an international flight.

It can be spread through sweat and saliva and there is no vaccine or cure.

Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond, who chaired a meeting of the Government’s Cobra emergency committee on the outbreak yesterday, said Ebola was a ‘very serious threat’.

But he sought to calm fears, saying it ‘most unlikely’ that Ebola could spread within the UK because of ‘frankly different’ standards of infection control here.

He said the logical approach was to tackle the outbreak at its source in West Africa, adding: ‘We do not, at the moment, think this is an issue that affects the UK directly.’

Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said the NHS was looking at its capability and taking ‘precautionary measures’ but he was ‘very confident’ it will be able to cope if the disease arrived in the UK. In other developments:

The outbreak started in Guinea in February and spread to neighbouring Liberia and Sierra Leone within weeks.

But international concern has been inflamed by the death of an American finance consultant in the Nigerian city of Lagos, Africa’s biggest and most densely populated metropolis and an international transport hub.

Patrick Sawyer, 40, had been on his way back to the US after attending the funeral of his sister in Liberia. She had also died from the disease.

British Airways flies daily to Lagos and also has regular flights to Freetown in Sierra Leone and Monrovia in Liberia.

Staff at all airlines have the discretion to deny boarding. A BA spokesman said: ‘The safety and security of our customers and crew is always our top priority.

‘We will fully comply with the guidance provided by local health authorities and continue to monitor the situation closely.’

Virgin Atlantic said its staff had been trained to spot symptoms, which range from flu-like fever and malaise initially, to vomiting, diarrhoea and, eventually, bleeding from the eyes, ears, nose and mouth.

Sufferers can experience convulsions and fall into a coma before dying from massive and irreparable damage to their internal organs.

It was unclear last night to what extent the UK would follow the practice of some countries and track down and quarantine all passengers on a plane used by a suspected sufferer.

But the tone of the latest official guidance suggested only those known to be in close physical proximity – five rows of seats surrounding the suspect – will be contacted for checks.

Dr Brian McCloskey, director of global health at Public Health England, insisted that airline passengers had little to fear, as direct contact with bodily fluids is needed for the disease to spread.

But he admitted that ‘it is not impossible’ that someone who is infected could arrive in the UK before developing any symptoms.

Heathrow Airport said it had a medical team on constant duty with the power to detain, isolate or send to hospital people with suspicious symptoms.

Dr Derek Gatherer, a Lancaster University expert on disease spread, said: ‘There is no treatment – nothing you can do yourself. It’s in the lap of the gods if you’re lucky to be one of the few who survive.’

Dr Ben Neuman, a Reading University 
virologist, said Ebola will come here eventually – but predicted it will
 be caught and shut down by border staff.

The Foreign Office sought to play down 
the likelihood of an outbreak in the UK, saying the Government ‘is 
confident the UK has experienced people who are ready to deal with 
anything if it were to arrive here’.

It added: ‘We have experienced scientists and doctors – the Royal Free Infectious Disease Unit, the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine – and a lot of experience of dealing with dangerous diseases. The risk of this disease spreading fast in the UK is much lower because of that.’

Liberia has closed all its schools, quarantined a number of communities and placed all non-essential workers on compulsory leave as part of an action plan that will be enforced by security.

Officials said hospitals were overwhelmed, an isolation unit in the capital Monrovia was over-run and patients were being treated in their homes. Information minister Lewis Brown said: ‘This is a major public health emergency.’

What is Ebola?

Ebola is a virus that causes a potentially lethal illness called hemorrhagic fever. This makes the body’s blood vessels porous and they start to leak, causing catastrophic internal bleeding. Up to nine out of ten people who contract the virus will die without immediate medical attention. The virus emerged in 1976 in an isolated village near the Ebola river in the Democratic Republic of Congo.

Why is the Government suddenly worried?

Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond chaired an emergency Cobra meeting on the issue yesterday because there are growing fears that the virus could enter Britain from Africa. The latest outbreak in West Africa is the worst on record – killing more than 670 people – and is also the first to affect people in cities and not just remote villages. In Guinea, the epidemic has reached the capital, Conakry.

What are the symptoms?

Dr Tom Fletcher of the Royal Army Medical Corps, who has treated victims in Guinea and Sierra Leone, says: ‘The initial symptoms are quite non-specific and similar to a flu-like illness. They include fever, headache and lethargy. This progresses to severe diarrhoea and vomiting.’ The incubation period for the virus varies from two days to three weeks.

Have there been any cases in Britain?

No. But Dr Ben Neuman, a virologist from the University of Reading who studies viruses such as Ebola, warns that it is statistically likely the virus will eventually come to the UK. The most immediate danger is that the virus will enter Britain on an airline flight. One victim, American Patrick Sawyer, had symptoms of the virus in Liberia but was allowed to board multiple international flights. Vomiting and suffering from diarrhoea, he flew from Liberia, stopped over in Ghana, changed planes in Togo and died in Nigeria.

What is the connection with bush meat?

Bush meat refers to any meat obtained from wild animals killed in rainforests. It is thought humans can contract Ebola from eating or handling infected meat from chimpanzees, fruit bats, forest antelopes and porcupines. There are fears that smuggled bush meat might be a route for the virus into Britain – 7,500 tonnes of illegal meat enters the country every year, and 55 per cent is said to be bush meat, which is then distributed through wholesalers or at local markets. 

How contagious is it?

It is less contagious than other diseases such as influenza and tuberculosis, which can spread for considerable distances through the air. Dr Fletcher said: ‘Ebola does not spread through the air. To contract it, you must have contact with an infected person’s blood or other bodily fluids, so the real risk is to family members and care givers.’

Should I worry?

‘The risk of anyone in Britain contracting Ebola is very small,’ stresses Dr Tom Solomon, an expert in viral infection, who is the director of the newly established Health Protection Research Unit. He adds: ‘If the outbreak in Africa is not brought under control, then that would increase the risk to people here.’

What if I think I have been in contact with an infected person?

Contact your GP immediately, although the health authorities are keen to avoid everyone who has flown from Africa rushing to their family doctor because it will overwhelm surgeries. If a passenger on a flight is identified as being infected with the virus, every other passenger on that flight will be contacted.

How can the disease be treated?

There is no cure for Ebola, although scientists across the world are working to develop treatments such as antiviral drugs. Other scientific teams are carrying out studies on antibodies – the body’s immune defence cells – from people who have recovered from the infection and have antibodies in their bodies that may neutralise the virus. ‘Many people do survive,’ says Dr Fletcher. ‘Treatment with drugs such as antibiotics and fluids given through intravenous drips can make a great difference. Loss of fluids is often a killer in Ebola cases. Up to half of patients can survive, if treated properly.’
