A Nebraska woman aboard a Caribbean cruise who fell ill last month quickly received a helping hand from 150 kindhearted passengers and crew willing to donate their blood to her cause.

Elaine Smith, now 73, was celebrating her birthday with husband Homer on the Carnival Liberty when she passed out after losing blood through a bleeding ulcer.

The crew broadcasted a plea for blood donors and an extraordinary number of them quickly answered the call.

'I was overwhelmed,' he said. 'I didn't count the people but I was told there were over 150 people there.'

But Mrs. Smith required B-positive blood.

Mr. Smith told the Sun-Sentinel that he was chosen to give a pint of blood to his wife, as were a crewman and two female passengers.

Carnival spokesman Vance Gulliksen told the Sun-Sentinel that that medical crews can currently screen blood donated while aboard the ship for HIV.

He says they will also soon be able to test for hepatitis.

Urgent: Smith was aboard the Carnival Liberty with her husband Homer when she collapsed, in part due to blood loss from a bleeding stomach ulcer

In order to minimize risk in emergency situations, cruise ships favor crewmembers for donations because they've been pre-screened for blood-borne illness.

They'll also turn to the sick passenger's family members.

When the captain was told of Mrs. Smith's illness, he increased speed to their next port-of-call.

Smith is now in a Jacksonville hospital where her nurse practitioner daughter Roberta King lives and works. Homer Smith became emotional discussing her journey there, which began Feb 22. 'The situation was horrible but they were so good to us,' he said

'When we got to Grand Cayman she got three [more units of blood at a hospital],' Smith told the Sun-Sentinel. 'On the air ambulance they gave her two.'

Smith was admitted to a Ft. Lauderdale hospital on Friday--which was her 73rd birthday--but her journey has not yet ended.

On Tuesday, Mrs. Smith was taken to a Jacksonville hospital, where her nurse practitioner daughter, Roberta King, lives and works.

'My daughter found out that [my wife] 
was taking a baby aspirin to help heart attacks and strokes, but if you 
have a tender stomach it can do damage that way and I didn't realize 
that,' Mr. Smith said.

In
 a Wednesday night post to her Facebook page, King indicated that her 
mother remained sedated and was recieving treatment for several health 
concerns in addition to her bleeding ulcer.

As
 he waits for his wife of 33 years' condition to improve, Homer Smith 
remained ever thankful for the goodness of his fellow Carnival Liberty 
passengers.

'The doctor,
 the nurses, the people, Guest Services, and they said any time you want
 to call your daughter, come down here and just talk,' he said. 'They 
didn't charge me one thing. I think that's great. I appreciate that a 
lot. The situation was horrible but they were so good to us.'
