Apple CEO Tim Cook has come out as gay for the first time, declaring his sexual orientation is one of the 'greatest gifts God has given me'.

Mr Cook, 53, said he had been open with many people about his sexuality for years but wanted to maintain a level of privacy in the public sphere.

However, in a first-person article for BloombergBusinessweek, he said he hopes coming out will inspire people to insist on their right to equality - and that is 'worth the trade-off with my own privacy'.

The declaration makes Mr Cook the highest-profile business CEO to have come out as being gay.

Apple CEO Tim Cook has come out as gay saying  his sexuality is one of the 'greatest gifts God has given me'

Mr Cook, pictured at gay pride on June 29, said his sexuality has been 'tough and uncomfortable' at times

Writing in Businessweek Mr Cook wrote: 'Let me be clear: I’m proud to be gay, and I consider being gay among the greatest gifts God has given me.

'Being gay has given me a deeper understanding of what it means to be in the minority and provided a window into the challenges that people in other minority groups deal with every day. 

'It’s made me more empathetic, which has led to a richer life.'  

He added: 'If hearing that the CEO of Apple is gay can help someone struggling to come to terms with who he or she is, or bring comfort to anyone who feels alone, or inspire people to insist on their equality, then it’s worth the trade-off with my own privacy.'

Part of social progress, Mr Cook explained, is understanding that a person is not defined by singular characteristics like their sexuality, and urged readers to remember that he is also engineer, an uncle, a nature lover, a fitness nut, a son of the South, a sports fanatic, and many other things.

But he conceded that he is part of a minority that could greatly benefit from his support. 

Throughout the 800-word essay, Mr Cook describes a 'tough and uncomfortable' existence at times from his 'humble roots' in Alabama to global success in Silicon Valley.

America, he said, 'has changed so much since I was a kid' and is moving towards equality, something helped by brave public figures that had come out and changed public perceptions.

Nonetheless, with laws still in place across the U.S. that make sexuality a sack-able offense, he said being gay has given him a 'deeper understanding' of what it means to be a minority. 

It had also made him more confident in his own identity, helped him 'rise above adversity and bigotry' and to develop the 'skin of a rhinoceros' that it takes to run a company like Apple. 

The motivation to write this article was inspired by the pictures on his office wall of Robert F Kennedy and Dr Martin Luther King Jr, who said: 'Life’s most persistent and urgent question is, "What are you doing for others?"'

While not considering himself an 'activist', Mr Cook said he realizes how much he had benefited from the 'sacrifice of others' so knew he needed to speak out. 

He said Apple had long advocated for human rights and equality. 

For example, he lists Apple's support of a workplace equality bill before Congress, and of marriage equality in California. 

In February, the company issued a public appeal to the state of Arizona urging them to abandon an anti-gay bill that would permit discrimination on religious grounds. 

The company, he said, holds up Dr King and Kennedy as icons for that ideal.

Mr Cook wrote: 'I don’t pretend that writing this puts me in their league. 

'All it does is allow me to look at those pictures and know that I’m doing my part, however small, to help others. 

'We pave the sunlit path toward justice together, brick by brick. This is my brick.'

In June, shortly before Mr Cook attended San Francisco's 44th annual Gay Pride Parade, he was accidentally outed on a CNBC current affairs show live on-air.

After Mr Hobbs made the remark the studio went silent as he tried and failed to recover from the comment

Simon Hobbs was one of several co-hosts when New York Times columnist Jim Stewart appeared on CNBC's Friday edition of Squawk on the Street to talk about an article he'd written that explores the dearth of openly gay CEOs. 

Speaking about how former CEO of BP Lord Browne became the first person at a Fortune 500 company to publicly acknowledge that he is gay, Mr Stewart said there's a 'corporate culture that prevents powerful gay men from going public.'

He said: 'You’d think CEOs especially are measured by objective criteria, financial performance.

Mr Stewart then went on to say that he had contacted a number of CEOs for a comment for his story and received a 'very cool reception'.

Then co-host Mr Hobbs piped up, saying, 'I think Tim Cook is fairly open about the fact he’s gay at the head of Apple, isn’t he?'

For a moment, a deafening silence filled the studio as the hosts looked awkwardly from one to the other before Mr Stewart, shaking his head in disapproval, responds with a succinct, 'No.'

Hobbs tried to recover, 'Oh, dear, was that an error? I thought he was open about it.' 

Tim Cook was born in Alabama and attended Auburn University.

After graduating he spent 12 years at IBM, rising to become director of North American Fulfillment.

He then served as Chief Operating Officer of the computer re-seller division of Intelligent Electronics and was Vice President for Corporate Materials at Compaq for six months.

Mr Cook joined Apple in 1998 - two years after being diagnosed with multiple sclerosis.

Despite being advised to stay with Compaq, Mr Cook said he wanted to join Apple within five minutes of meeting Steve Jobs. 

Mr Cook later said the offer was a 'once in a lifetime opportunity' to work with a 'creative genius'.

Mr Cook's first job was as Senior Vice President for Worldwide Operations. He also worked as Executive Vice President of Worldwide Sales and Operations and was Chief Operating Officer until he was named the CEO on August 24, 2011, when he succeeded Mr Jobs

Since taking over as CEO, Mr Cook has overseen the introduction and launch of five new iPhones, including the current iPhone 6 and 6 Plus, as well as 7 new iPads, including the iPad mini. The company will also introduce its first smartwatch in early 2015; The Apple Watch.

Under Mr Cook, Apple also purchased Beats Audio, the headphones and music firm owned by rapper Dr Dre, in a multi-billion dollar deal concluded earlier this year.

According to the Interbrand Best Global Brands report, Apple is currently the world's most valuable brand, with a valuation of $118.9 billion. 

Earlier this month the firm announced record iPhone sales as part of their quarterly results. The record-breaking launch of the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus - with 10 million units sold in the first weekend, meant the technology giant reported net profit of $8.5 billion for the final quarter of 2014.

Up to the time of the announcement, 40 million iPhones had been sold in Q4. Since then, the new iPad Air 2 and iPad mini 3 have also gone on sale.

Mr Cook also serves on the board of directors of Nike, Inc.and the National Football Foundation.
