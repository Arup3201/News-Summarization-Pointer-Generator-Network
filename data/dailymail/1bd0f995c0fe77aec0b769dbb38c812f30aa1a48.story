A mother-to-be who thought she was only eight weeks pregnant went to hospital fearing she was miscarrying - and gave birth to healthy twins.

Katie Brown, 35, was stunned when doctors told her she was actually 31 weeks pregnant and carrying two babies.

What she had mistaken for a miscarriage was actually the onset of labour - and twins Amy and Daniel arrived less than 24 hours later.

Ms Brown and her partner, James Moore, 31, are now home in Darnley, West Yorkshire, with their unexpected arrivals.

Ms Brown said: ‘I thought I was just putting weight on.

‘I did a pregnancy test in July and it came back negative. Then I did one at the beginning of November and it was positive.

‘When I went to the hospital I thought I had lost my baby. But once they did tests at the hospital they told me I was 31 weeks pregnant and that I was expecting twins.

‘We couldn't believe it, it was a good job we were sitting down.

‘People cannot believe that I didn't know, but I didn't feel any kicking. It is brilliant and I am just glad we are home in time for Christmas.’

Amy and Daniel were born on November 14. Daniel weighed 3lb 12oz and Amy weighed 2lb 14oz. They were kept in hospital until they had gained some weight and have now been allowed home for Christmas

Ms Brown, who also has an eight year-old daughter, Laura, went into Pinderfields Hospital in Wakefield on November 14.

Daniel was the first to arrive at 5.48pm the following day weighing 3b 12oz, his sister emerged 13 minutes later weighing 2lb 14oz.

Amy needed initial help with her breathing and the babies remained in hospital until they put on some weight.

Mr Moore, a warehouse worker, said: ‘It's all been overwhelming. We now need a new house.

‘It was a fantastic surprise and I am glad they are all home in time for Christmas. It is going to be the best Christmas ever.

‘Both our families and friends have been brilliant and I don't know how we would have coped without them.

‘We also want to say a massive thank you to all the staff on the neonatal ward at Pinderfields Hospital for everything they've done.’

He added: ‘I went from thinking Katie had suffered a miscarriage to being told I was about to become a father to twins.

‘When the doctor gave us the good news after a scan, I felt a mixture of shock and excitement.

‘We were so upset one minute and then we were so happy. Our emotions ran really high.

Mr Moore said that after Amy and Daniel (pictured) were born they were totally unprepared but friends and family rallied round to buy them all of the things they would need

‘I've been told that the colour instantly drained from my face. I went white as a sheet and if I'd been standing up I'm sure I would have passed out.

‘I just remember Katie saying over and over again “how am I having twins?”

‘We were both as shocked as each other.’

Mr Moore explained that his partner had put on three stone in a few months but that they just assumed she was eating too much.

He said they were completely unprepared for their new arrivals but family and friends clubbed together and bought everything they needed as a surprise present.

Ms Brown and her partner, James Moore, were aware that she had gained three stone in a matter of months but believed she was just eating too much as a pregnancy test in the summer had come back negative

Ms Brown said: 'People cannot believe that I didn't know, but I didn't feel any kicking. It is brilliant and I am just glad we are home in time for Christmas'

‘It would have been so much more stressful for us if it hadn't been for our friends and family,’ he said.

‘Katie and the twins were kept in hospital for a week after the birth and I stayed with them.

‘When we came out we hadn't bought a single thing but our friends and family had all pooled their money and bought everything we needed.

‘We are so grateful to have such supportive family and friends. I don't know what we would have done without them.’
