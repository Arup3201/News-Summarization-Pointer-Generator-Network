Hard worker: Alex Gibson, despite her dyslexia, has now secured a first class law degree and beaten her former employer at a 8-day tribunal

A bullied secretary quit her job to study a law degree so she could take on her bosses in court after being inspired by the Oscar-winning film about campaigner Erin Brockovich.

Alex Gibson resigned from her £16,000-a-year job after being repeatedly taunted over her dyslexia and disabilities from a biking accident.

With no money to pay for a solicitor, the 36-year-old instead decided to enrol on a law degree and fight for justice herself.

Yesterday she was enjoying a double celebration, after winning her discrimination case and graduating from university with first-class honours.

Her story mirrors that of Erin Brockovich who, despite having no legal training, managed to teach herself law and take on a huge US corporation in a multi-million pound lawsuit.

Her victory was made into a movie starring Julia Roberts in 2000.

Miss Gibson said: ‘I was distraught and couldn’t believe the way I’d been treated, so was determined that I would defend myself and get justice.

‘I got my inspiration from the Erin Brockovich film. She won against all the odds and I was determined to do the same. I’m just happy I stood up to the bullies and I won.’

Miss Roberts won an Oscar for her portrayal of Miss Brockovich, 53, an environmental activist who in the 1990s proved a major Californian energy firm was poisoning a town’s water supply.

Miss Gibson’s ordeal began in October 2010 when she secured a job as a clerical worker in an office in her home town of Bangor, north Wales.

The former hospitality and operations manager had been left permanently disabled after a serious biking accident in Bolivia two years earlier, which meant she had to wear an arm brace.

She claimed that within a few weeks of starting work her line manager made a hurtful and discriminatory comment about her arm.

When she complained, she was told she needed ‘counselling’ to come to terms with her disability.

The problems got worse when bosses ordered her to take minutes of their monthly meetings, a task outside Miss Gibson’s original job remit which she found difficult because of her dyslexia.

She said: ‘I couldn’t keep up and I was ridiculed in front of all my colleagues.

‘The stress gave me anxiety problems.

My hair fell out and I couldn’t sleep. I was throwing up before work.

I resigned shortly after and started to build a case – I wasn’t going to let them get away with it.’

She began studying law at Bangor University in 2011 and represented herself in the employment tribunal hearing in February last year, successfully arguing she had been the victim of disability discrimination and harassment.

She has been offered a four-figure sum, but is appealing to increase this. Under the terms of the settlement she cannot name the firm she worked for.

Miss Gibson was only able to complete her degree – condensed into two years – after receiving specialist support for her disability from the university.

A spokesman for Bangor University congratulated Miss Gibson on her graduation, in July, and her court victory, adding: ‘Starting university presented a much bigger challenge for Alex than most.’
