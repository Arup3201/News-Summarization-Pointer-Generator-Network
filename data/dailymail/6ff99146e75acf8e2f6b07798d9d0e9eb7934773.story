Rappers, footballers and celebrities love to wrap their
cars in personalised art.

But many believe this velvet-wrapped Porsche Panamera turbo,
seen on a suburban London street, has taken garish design to new levels.

The soft-looking black Porsche belongs to a mystery owner who lives in East Grinstead.

It’s the first of its kind in the country, and the handiwork
of car-wrap firm Raccoon, which charged £2,500 for the design.

The velvet car, spotted in London and Sussex, became an instant hit on Twitter. Car-wrap firm Raccoon supplied the £2,500 wrap to mystery owner and say this is the first car in the country to have it

Named the Velvet Elite 9100, the wrap is available for all vehicle types, and is available in a range of colours, including fuchsia pink and orange

The car came to the attention of the world when
former Apprentice contestant James Lester spotted the Panamera outside his
estate agents in Fulham, west London.

Photos of the car quickly went viral on Twitter with many
wondering why someone would want to ruin a £60-100k Porsche?

Helen Moser tweeted: ‘A velvet-wrapped Porsche!!! So what
happens when a pigeon craps on it eh?’

Richard Dorman, 25, who lives in East Grinstead, said he had
seen the Porsche several times.

‘It looks like a furry mouse whizzing about the place - it's
an eyesore really,’ he said.

‘Every time I see it now I look away as I can't believe that
such a lovely car has been ruined.’

The material will last roughly three years and, if the mystery owner has a change of heart, the wrap can be removed by professionals restoring the car to a just off the production line state

The wrap is coated with special adhesives and durable textile fibers to withstand severe weather condition.

The material will need changing in three years.

It can be cleaned by hand or using a jet wash without requiring special products.

Jim Holder of Autocar magazine, told the Independent:
‘The owner could - and should - be a laughing stock,’ he said.

‘It's a
Marmite thing, but the owner loves it,' Richard Clark, managing director of Raccoon told the Independent.  'Hard as it is to believe, it's really
easy to wash. Just not in a car wash.’

Scott Mackay the
marketing manager at Raccoon, told 
MailOnline. 'When we moved it out of the garage, a work van stopped 
in its tracks from a main road and reversed up the road with the workmen
 jumping out to look at the vehicle.'

While the Porsche Panamera was the first of its kind in the
UK, Raccoon claims demand for the material is growing.

‘It’s a material that needs to be seen to be believed,’ said
Mackay, ‘With any luck, our streets could soon be a much furrier place.’
