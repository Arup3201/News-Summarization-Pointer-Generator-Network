Two IRA terrorists involved in a foiled bomb attack on an Army barracks have been arrested on suspicion of money-laundering in Spain.

Leonard ‘Bap’ Hardy and his wife Donna Maguire, who tried to blow up the base at Osnabruck, Germany, in 1989, were held in a police station in Malaga earlier this week.

A Spanish man was also held over the alleged scam.

The couple, from Dundalk, County Louth, who have four children, were yesterday waiting to hear whether they would be released without charge or have their detention extended, according to the Sun newspaper.

Local police were unable to give any further information.

In 2006, Hardy, now 53, was sentenced to six years in jail by a court in Celle, Germany, for his part in the Osnabruck plot, in which he ‘intended to kill as many British soldiers as possible’. 

But he walked free because the offence took place before 1998’s Good Friday Agreement, which saw those convicted of IRA terror offences released from prison.

In the plot, five bombs containing 330lb of Semtex were planted at Quebec barracks, at the Osnabruck base

Four others involved in the bombing – including Maguire, now 57 – were convicted of attempted murder in 1995.

Maguire, a former convent girl once described as the most dangerous woman in Europe, received a nine-year sentence for spying on British military bases in Germany with intent to sabotage. 

But she was also freed immediately because she had spent almost six years on remand.

In the plot, five bombs containing 330lb of Semtex were planted at Quebec barracks, at the Osnabruck base.

They were discovered at the last minute when a civilian employee surprised two attackers. One bomb exploded, causing extensive damage but no casualties.

Hardy also avoided jail last July after settling a £280,000 tax bill and pleading guilty to eight counts of failing to file tax returns. He paid a fine of £6,500.
