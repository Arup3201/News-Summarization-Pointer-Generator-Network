Tragic: Three-year-old Lia was rushed to hospital but pronounced dead on arrival

A couple were questioned last 
night on suspicion of the murder of their three-year-old daughter who 
neighbours described as a ‘little princess’.

Lia Green’s parents called an ambulance last Thursday morning to say she was ‘feeling unwell’.

Paramedics fought to save her, but despite their efforts she was pronounced dead on arrival at hospital.

Tests found that Lia, who is 
understood to have been known to social services, had suffered what 
police called ‘significant internal injuries caused by violence’.

Her mother Natalie Critchley, 20, and father Richard Green, 22, were arrested on suspicion of murder.

The couple, who also have a one-year-old daughter, have been released on bail until next month pending further inquiries, Lancashire Police said this morning.

Shocked neighbours of the couple in 
Preston spoke of their disbelief and said they used to call Lia a 
‘little princess’ because of her pretty face and lovely smile.

Her parents called an ambulance to  
their £90,000 terraced house in the  Plungington area of the city at 
about 8am last Thursday.

Det Chief Insp Stuart Dixon of 
Lancashire Police said they told the operator ‘they were concerned by 
Lia’s health and she was deteriorating quite quickly’.

He added that she
was dead on arrival at Royal Preston Hospital from internal injuries.

Investigation: A forensic officer removes evidence from the murder scene

Arrested: Richard Green, 22, was arrested on suspicion of murder, after Lia Green, 3, was pronounced dead at Preston Royal Hospital. Both he and his partner have been released on bail

‘The post mortem has been conducted 
and while there were no significant injuries on the outside of her body,
there were significant internal injuries caused by violence,’ he said.

Miss Critchley and her partner are 
engaged according to their Facebook profiles. It is believed the family 
were known to police and social services.

A team of 30 detectives were yesterday
visiting neighbours and checking CCTV footage in the street and in 
public parks ‘to build up a picture of Lia’s family lifestyle in the 
days leading up to her death’, Mr Dixon said.

‘We are going to continue to speak to people who knew Lia such as family members and friends.

‘The main focus of our enquires are the injuries and to determine how she got her injuries.’

Det Supt Dermott Horrigan, from 
Lancashire’s Force Major Investigation Team, said: ‘This is an 
incredibly complex and sensitive inquiry and we have a team of highly 
trained and professional officers looking into the matter.

‘The death of a child will always be greeted with shock and a deep sense of sadness.

‘We have dedicated neighbourhood 
policing officers working in the area and talking to residents and I 
would urge anyone who has any concerns to speak to them.’

Tribute: A card and flowers from a wellwisher sit outside Lia's home in Preston

Yesterday one neighbour said they 
would often see Lia playing in the street and added: ‘She was often 
called the little princess because she had such a fair face and lovely 
blonde hair and a lovely smile. It’s such a tragedy and everyone is in 
utter shock.’

Another said: ‘Lia was a really sunny, pleasant little child.

‘The mum was very quiet and you would 
see her go past pushing the pushchair and Lia would be giggling. She was
always smiling and happy.’

One message on a bunch of flowers left
at the scene said: ‘Little Lia you never failed to make us smile. Rest 
in peace beautiful angel.’

Another said: ‘Princess Lia. Sadly missed. Always in our hearts.’
