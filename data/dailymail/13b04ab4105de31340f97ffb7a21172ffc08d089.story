A keen cyclist who lost part of his finger in a hunting accident has made himself a prosthetic replacement out of old bicycle parts.

Colin MacDuff, 41, accidentally blew most of his middle finger off with a stray bullet in 2010 and has since used his experience as a welder to create a workable fake digit.

His creation has become a lucrative business for the war veteran as the prosthetic finger market is underdeveloped.

Mr MacDuff charges between £3,550 and £6,100 for a customised mechanical finger for amputees and has obtained a U.S. patent for his business venture.

He said: 'My finger has three parts. The tip, the cage, which goes over my amputation and the ring part that sits where a normal ring would sit.'

Mr Macduff constructed the prosthetic device using leftover bike parts, including a rear derailleur hanger, to simulate a normal fingertip.

After his accident Mr MacDuff, a Gulf War Navy veteran, said ordinary tasks like buttoning his shirt, holding a glass and typing became impossible but doctors told him that there were no prosthetics for finger amputees available.

In a bid to regain dexterity, he used his love of bikes, along with his degree in computer-aided design, to take matters into his own hands.

Mr MacDuff said: 'I basically woke my wife up at three in the morning and told her I was going to make a new finger out of bicycle parts - and soon as I was able to, I did. So that's how it came up.'

He said he was also inspired by the amputees he saw at racing events who created prosthetic arms using RockShox parts and paraplegics who fitted their wheelchairs with 26-inch mountain bike tires.

Mr MacDuff designs the mechanical digits in his home workshop in Olympia, Washington.

He uses a manufacturer with 3D printing to create full, partial, and thumb prosthetics made from medical grade plastic; an evolution of the finger be created using old bicycle parts.

'There are so many materials out there 
that cause skin irritations, half the time patients will not wear it and
just toss it in a draw,' he said.

'My product is designed to be worn 24 hours a day.'

It takes roughly 10 to 12 weeks for Mr MacDuff to create a mechanical finger but he hopes that before long he will be able to provide amputees with a device within a week.

He said: 'I'm not providing your finger back, I'm providing you a tool for your daily activities - and once you learn how to use that tool - it becomes part of you.

'I actually wear it 24 hours a day...I wear it swimming, mountain biking, gardening, and hunting.'
