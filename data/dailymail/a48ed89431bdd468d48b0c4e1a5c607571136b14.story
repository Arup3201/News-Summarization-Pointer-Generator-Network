Jay Williams wrote to the author in 1980 asking him to look at a short story he had written

A Brutally honest letter written by Roald Dahl to a teenager who asked him for advice on his A-level project has surfaced.

Budding writer Jay Williams wrote to the author in 1980 asking him to look at a short story he had written.

The 17-year-old did not expect a reply. But Mr Williams, who grew up near Carlisle, was delighted when he received a typed note signed by the man himself. However, in true Dahl style, there was a sting in the tail. 

However the letter was not what the eager teenager had expected with Dahl heavily criticising his use of 'beastly adjectives'.

The correspondence read: 'Dear Jay, You are asking too much of me. You must realise I get an awful lot of these letters and you can't expect me to write your thesis for you.

'It should be fairly obvious to you what the role of a short story is in modern literature. It's a big one.

'Study particularly the American short story writers like O'Henry and Runyon and Hawthorne and Poe, and lots and lots of English ones.

'If you want any dope on me there have been an awful lot of profiles in English magazines over the past year starting with the February 1979 edition of Vogue.

'I have read your story. I don't think it's bad, but you must stop using too many adjectives.

Roald Dahl responded saying the teenager was 'asking too much,' but that said that he had read his story

'Study Hemingway, particularly his early work and learn how to write short sentences and how to eschew all those beastly adjectives.

'Surely it is better to say 'She was a tall girl with a bosom' than 'She was a tall girl with a shapely, prominent bosom', or some such rubbish. The first one says it all.'

Jay, who now lives in Bristol, recently found the letter while going through old boxes and posted a picture on Twitter.

The image was posted alongside the caption: 'In 1980, as a spotty teenager, I wrote to Roald Dahl asking for advice on writing. Here is his priceless response.'

Amazingly it has now been re-tweeted more than 1,700 times and has been favourited by almost 2,400 people.

Jay, who set up PR company 72point, said: 'As a callow youth, I was expecting him to tell me how marvellous the story was, and offer to introduce me to his publisher.

'Instead he gave me this fairly forthright criticism.

'The story was for an A-Level English Literature project, and was probably really self-indulgent, overflowing with flowery adjectives, which Dahl quite rightly bristled at.

'After considering his advice, I have to admit it was probably fair and I've taken heed of it ever since.

'I was a big fan of Dahl's short stories aimed at adults, like Kiss Kiss. I loved their dark elements, the twist in the tale.

'Dahl's advice has informed whatever writing style I have had since, especially in news reporting.'
