Hewlett-Packard, the world's largest maker of personal computers, has announced plans to cut 27,000 jobs.

The move, which will affect about 8 per cent of the company's 350,000-strong workforce, will form part of a cost-cutting drive aimed at saving up to £2.2bn a year.

The company, which has operations in 180 countries and employs about 20,000 people in the UK, said the changes would 'impact just about every business and region'.

Cost-cutting: Hewlett-Packard, the world's largest maker of personal computers, is to slash 27,000 jobs

The jobs will go by October 2014 in the largest payroll purge in the group's 73-year history.

It comes eight months after HP hired Meg Whitman as chief executive to turn the company around.

The former chief executive of eBay joined HP last September as rival products such as the iPad tablet computer ate into HP's sales.

Ms Whitman said: 'Work force reductions are never easy.

'They adversely impact people's lives, but in this case, they are absolutely critical to the long-term health of the company.

'Our goal is simple: a better outcome for the customers at reduced cost for HP.'

Making changes: Chief executive Meg Whitman said the job losses were 'absolutely critical to the long-term health of the company'

A spokesman for the company said it was too early to say exactly where the job cuts would hit, but no part of the business would escape some losses.

'We have not yet announced specific plans with regards to specific locations,' he said.

'We do expect the workforce reduction to impact just about every business and region.'

As part of the changes, the head of HP's Autonomy division, Mike Lynch, is being replaced by Bill Veghte, HP's chief strategy officer.

Mr Lynch will leave after what HP called a 'transition period'.

Mr Lynch founded software company Autonomy as a small start-up and turned into one of the UK's largest technology companies.

It was bought by HP last year for more than $10bn.

HP said it would avoid as many redundancies as possible by offering early retirement packages.

Word of the cut had leaked out in media reports late last week, so the news came as no surprise.

Nevertheless, the sobering details overshadowed the release of HP's latest quarterly results.

Although HP's earnings and revenue declined from a year ago, the numbers were better than analysts had projected.

HP delivered another pleasant surprise by offering a forecast that raised hopes that the company may be poised to bounce back.

'While I wouldn't say we have turned the corner, we are making real progress,' Ms Whitman told analysts during a conference call.

Ms Whitman cautioned that 'turning HP around is going to be a lot of hard work'.

'It's going to take time,' she added. 'But we know what needs to be done.'

Investors were pleased, although it was unclear whether their glee had more to do with the cost-cutting or the company's performance during its fiscal second quarter, which ended in April.

Competition: Rival products such as the iPad, left, and the iPhone, right, have eaten into HP's sales

HP shares surged $1.97, or more than 9 percent, to $23.05 in Wednesday's extended trading.

That's still about half their value before HP parted ways with Mark Hurd, a cost-costing specialist who stepped down in 2010 amid a scandal revolving around the nature of his relationship with a former actress who worked as an HP contractor.

An investigation uncovered inaccurate expense reports.

The current troubles at HP have been blamed both on Mr Hurd, who cut research and development to boost profits, and his successor, Leo Apotheker, who failed to respond to the threat posed by a shift to computing on smartphones and tablets.

Ms Whitman's plan calls for less bureaucracy so the company can respond more quickly to customer needs.

She also wants to boost research and development to spur more innovation.

HP, which is based in Palo Alto, California, has been struggling to sell more personal computers and printers, partly because they aren't needed as much now that people are spending so much time surfing the Web on phones and tablets such as Apple's iPad.

The company's efforts to sell more business software and consulting services have been stymied by competition from the likes of IBM and Oracle.

Hewlett-Packard employs about 20,000 in the UK, based at six offices:

Bracknell

London

Bristol

Warrington

Erskine

Belfast

Ms Whitman plans to funnel most of the savings from the job cuts into product development, with an emphasis on three areas: software services delivered online, a concept known as 'cloud computing'; data storage and analysis; and computer security.

Some of the extra cash will go toward boosting HP's earnings, too.

HP's workforce has undergone several other reorganisations during the past decade.

Two of the biggest occurred during Mr Hurd's regime.

HP announced 14,500 job cuts in 2005 in one of his first big acts as CEO.

HP also announced 24,600 cuts in 2008 after buying technology consulting service EDS for $13.9 billion.

HP did not say where the latest cuts would come from.

It is combining its printer and PC divisions, which could reduce costs.

The company earned $1.6 billion, or 80 cents per share, between February and April - down 31 per cent on last year's figures.
