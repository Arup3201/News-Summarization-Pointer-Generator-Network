Luis Suarez may be poised for a quick return to English shores as Spanish giants Barcelona will prepare for the new season at St George’s Park.

The four-times European champions have booked themselves into the home of English football for a training camp between July 28 and August 2.

Their precise squad is not yet known 
due to World Cup commitments but it raises the possibility of Lionel 
Messi, Neymar and Andres Iniesta training on the pitches England use so 
often.

Technically, if Luis Suarez is a Barcelona player by the time of the trip, he would not be able to train because of his four-month ban from all football-related activity.

However, Suarez may be allowed to train owing to revised terms of his world football ban, which he has appealed.

The Uruguayan is poised to leave Liverpool this weekend for around £72m.

'I
 am absolutely delighted that FC Barcelona have decided to join us for 
their pre-season preparations later this month,' said St. George's 
Park's Managing Director, Julie Harrington.

'This
 is hugely exciting news for St. George's Park and The FA, and it is a 
real pleasure to be able to have one of European football's most 
successful clubs train at our facility.

'We
 look forward to welcoming the players and staff, and helping ensure 
their visit with us is both an enjoyable and memorable experience.'

St George's Park, built at a cost of £105million, was opened by the Football Association in October 2012.

Ahead
 of its official use, the FA took in trips to Barcelona's training 
headquarters as part of a fact finding mission to bring the best 
facilities to England.
