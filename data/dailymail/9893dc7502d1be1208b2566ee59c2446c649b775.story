A neighborhood have held Christmas early for a father who has just weeks to live after an unexpected diagnosis.

Frank Henderson, 60, Shoreline, Washington, only found out he had cancer two weeks ago and has been given a fortnight to live.

But already the family have packed in lots of activities they want to carry out with him including celebrating Christmas in September.

The family began to decorate their home and once neighbors learned about Frank's condition and his enjoyment of the festive period, they decorated their own houses with lights to show solidarity 

The father-of-five was scheduled to undergo unrelated surgery on September 13 when he underwent a CAT scan after complaining of stomach pains.

The prognosis left the family stunned - his daughter Thea told Today  they found out he had cancer 'everywhere,' leaving him 'a few weeks to a month' to live.

She says an oncologist determined it may be only a matter of days and that is when his wife Jan, children Neil, Nate, Nic, Thea and Cory, and ex-wife Debbie Willis threw themselves into making lots of memories. 

Immediately resourceful Frank made a list Bucket List that started with home-improvement projects, so that his family would not have to worry about such tasks after his death.

The family carried out all the tasks together and then realised that Frank, a commercial truck driver, may not be around to put up the Christmas lights as he did every year

The family smile for a photo - they are determined to make some special memories with Frank in the time they have left with him

'We were all talking about this Bucket List, and someone mentioned in passing, 'Don't worry, we'll make sure we'll put up the Christmas lights, too, at Christmas,' said Thea.

'And then it kind of hit us that that's Dad's thing.'

The family began to decorate their home and once neighbors learned about Frank's condition and his enjoyment of the festive period, they decorated their own houses with lights to show solidarity.

The family knew that Frank would miss the chance to dance with his Thea at her wedding so they set up a photoshoot with Thea wearing a donated wedding dress and Frank wearing a suit

Neighborhood kids even brought over snow they had saved from last winter to make the occassion as special as they could. 

The family knew that Frank would miss the chance to dance with his Thea at her wedding so they set up a photoshoot with Thea wearing a donated wedding dress and Frank wearing a suit.

They danced to multiple songs, including Stevie Ray Vaughan's 'Pride and Joy.'

'For my little dad — who's been in a recliner for 10 or 11 days now — that was his time to sort of bust loose and let it all out. He just started dancing, and that's been our thing, ever since I was tiny,' she said.

'It's kinda surreal,' Frank told KBOI2.

'We all sit around and hold each others' hands and cry. We hug each other, and we know it's going to happen. 

'But if I was, I think, if I was mad, then that would change everybody's position. But God didn't do this to me, and He's not punishing me or anything. 

'It's just a fact. And He wants people to be examples, of loving other people and then letting them share. Because people need to share.'

The Henderson family have been contacted by people across the world who have been inspired by their story.

His daughter Thea wrote on Facebook: 'My Dad has a 1 of a kind spirit. He is quick to love, quick to trust, quick to forgive and slow, VERY SLOW to anger. 

'He has raised 5 children and created one huge loving, supportive and caring family who surround him now.

He is a grandfather to 3 beautiful grandchildren and wants nothing more than to watch them grow up. He is SO proud of the father’s his sons have become. He loves my mama more than anything, which you can tell simply by the way he looks at her or calls her “honey-bunny.” 

'Their marriage is an amazing example of the love they share, 24 years strong. They have made each other better, and I know my Daddy will always be with her, and making her smile… or making her roll her eyes and laugh at his crazy dance moves.

Frank has videotaped a private message to each of his family so they can watch it in the future.
