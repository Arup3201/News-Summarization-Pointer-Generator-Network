A Maryland high school arranged an unofficial, private graduation ceremony for a senior whose mother was terminally ill.

Megan Sugg said that Thursday’s ceremony at her mother’s bedside was hard, but she’s glad her mother got to see her graduate from Glen Burnie High School.

The Sugg family contacted staff at Glen Burnie High when they realised that Darlene Sugg, 48, wouldn't live long enough to see her daughter graduate on June 10.

Darlene Sugg was diagnosed with colorectal cancer in November 2010 when she was 44.

She was in remission for a year, but the cancer metastasised to her liver.

'I thought she might be able to make it, but the last couple days she went downhill pretty quick,' Steve Sugg, Megan’s father, told The Capital.

The Sugg family cheered as Megan, in cap and gown, moved a tassel from one side of her cap to the other.

'I was surprised they came out so fast because principals are so busy,' Megan told The Capital. 'It was supportive and really nice of them.'

Principal Vickie Plitt spoke of Megan’s promising future.

Miss Plitt's own mother is battling cancer, and Megan often confided in her, reports The Capital.

'I know how proud her mum is of her and we really wanted to give her family a special time,' she said.

'And to really honour Megan, because as much as she’s had going on, she’s pushed through and is going to graduate high school.'

Above and beyond: Megan Sugg's graduation was first time Glen Burnie High has created such an event for a pupil with an ill parent, although there have been similar events for sick children

School counsellor Kristin Canevazzi said that this is the first time Glen Burnie High has created such an event for a pupil with an ill parent, although there have been similar events for terminally ill children.

'Overall it was really sad, but a precious moment that I felt grateful to be part of and one that I hope Megan and her family will remember forever,' Canevazzi told the Capital Gazette.

Darlene Sugg passed away on Saturday surrounded by her family. Megan will pursue her dreams of being a dietician and a fitness model after high school.
