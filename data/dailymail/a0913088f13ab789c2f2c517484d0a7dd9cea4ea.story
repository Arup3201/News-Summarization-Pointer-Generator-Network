Brits have revealed the worst Christmas presents they have ever received including a car exhaust, maggots and a can of spam.

A poll of 2,000 people found that the 'awful gifts' were all panicky last minute buys from 'loved ones'.

Other dreadful items to grace a list of the Top Ten Worst Gifts were a jar of pickled gherkins, a loaf of bread and a packet of bean sprouts.

And the winner is! A poll of 2,000 people by Barclays revealed a can of spam to be the worst Christmas present received by a Brit

The poll was compiled by Barclays, which found that ten per cent of Brits leave buying some of their gifts until Christmas Day and end up popping out to the local petrol station for a last minute present.

David Jarman, 31, of Chesham, Bucks, said: 'If I got a can of spam or a car exhaust for Christmas I would take back the presents I'd bought them.

'Christmas is about thinking of other people, not buying stuff that nobody wants or that you can find in the kitchen cupboard, or under your car.'

Barclays bosses said it had come up with a solution for those who forget to buy a present, saying they can get gift vouchers - for stores such as Debenhams, Cineworld, iTunes and Nintendo - 'pinged' to their phones on Christmas Day.

Darren Foulds, Managing Director of Barclays Mobile Banking and Pingit, said this week: 'Busy lives and a desire to avoid the crowds mean it's no surprise that many people leave their present shopping to the last minute.

A poll compiled by Barclays revealed the most dreadful Christmas presents Brits have ever received. Here are ten of the worst:  

1. Can of Spam

2. Car exhaust

3. Jar of pickled gherkins

4. Loaf of bread

5. Packet of bean sprouts

6. Extension lead for a garden mower

7. 20 feet of chain

8. Hoover bags

9. Maggots

10. Stepladder

'Thankfully while a petrol station may have traditionally been the only option for frantic shoppers, consumers can now use their mobile or tablet to buy last minute Christmas gifts in time for the big day.

'Since its launch consumers have used Barclays Pingit to send money quickly and safely, but can now also choose from a range of fantastic gifts including experience days, gift cards, subscriptions and iTunes services - which mean it's even easier to send thoughtful, last minute gifts for friends and family.'

With so many Brits claiming they have received terrible Christmas gifts - many have had to learn how to master their present-opening face.

MailOnline recently met Dr Simon Moore, a chartered psychologist with the British Psychological Society, to discover the verbal and physical signs that reveal what people really think of their present. 

The good news for those worried about their acting skills, said Dr Moore, is that spotting fake happiness is quite hard, with the detection rate for the average person being around 40 to 50 per cent.

This is handy - as a recent survey by eBay revealed that 59% of people are steeling themselves to feign delight if they unwrap presents they don’t want this today .

'Awful gifts': A packet of bean sprouts was voted the fifth worst present on the list, while a stepladder came in at number ten

Dr Moore says a select few will be able to correctly see through around seven or eight out of 10 attempts to fake joy.

The trick to up your detection rate, said Dr Moore, is never to look for one or two signals, but a cluster of them.

These include agitation, the freezing of the face, touching the face and shaking the head, leaning away from the gift and smiling unnaturally.
