A Russian hacker took over a BBC computer server before trying to sell access to the system on Christmas Day.

It is understood the corporation's security team responded to the issue three days later on Saturday but now believes it has secured the site.

It is not known whether the hacker stole data or caused any damage during the attack.

The hacker is understood to have compromised a server that manages a password-protected website, typically used to manage the transfer of large data files over the Internet.

A BBC spokesman told Reuters: 'We do not comment on security issues.'

US cybersecurity firm Hold Security LLC first identified the incident. The company monitors underground cyber-crime forums in search of stolen information.

Alex Holden, Hold Security's founder and chief information security officer, told Reuters how the firm's researchers spotted a notorious Russian hacker, known online as 'HASH' and 'Rev0lver' attempting to sell access to the server on Christmas Day.

The hacker offered proof he had infiltrated the site by showing files which could only be accessed by somebody controlling it, Mr Holden said.

He said the firm had found no evidence any conversations led to a deal or that data was stolen from the BBC.

It is common for hackers to buy and sell access to compromised servers on underground forums.

Hackers may use such infiltrations to gain further access to the victim organisation's systems.

Compromised servers can also be used to set up command-and-control centers for cyber-crime operations known as botnets, run spam campaigns or launch denial of service attacks to knock websites off line.

Justin Clarke, a principal consultant for the cybersecurity firm Cylance Inc, told Reuters while 'HASH' was only offering access to an obscure FTP server, some buyers might see it as a stepping stone to more prized assets within the BBC.

He said: 'Accessing that server establishes a foothold within BBC's network which may allow an attacker to pivot and gain further access to internal BBC resources,' he said.

Media companies, including the BBC, have repeatedly been targeted by the Syrian Electronic Army, which supports Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, and other hacker activist groups that deface websites and take over Twitter accounts.

Last January the New York Times reported that it had been repeatedly attacked over four months by Chinese hackers who obtained employees' passwords.
