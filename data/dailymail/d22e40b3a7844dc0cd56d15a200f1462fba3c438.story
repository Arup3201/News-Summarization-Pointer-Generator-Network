Their beautiful brand of football is the envy of the world and almost impossible to replicate.

But it seems the clubs of the English Premier League and the Championship are more than happy to take just a little sprinkling of that Barcelona magic.

The Catalan club have published a dream team of their former players currently playing at clubs in England's top two divisions - and it's a pretty talented bunch.

While the likes of Alexis Sanchez, Yaya Toure, Cesc Fabregas, Mikel Arteta and Victor Valdes are household names, there are plenty of lesser-known La Masia graduates making the grade too.

Here are the Barcelona Brits in full...

GOALKEEPER

Victor Valdes (Manchester United)

Barcelona 1995-2014

Vastly experienced goalkeeper who made a remarkable 535 appearances for Barcelona's first-team, winning six La Liga title and three Champions League crowns.

He ended two decades at Barcelona midway through last season and has since been reunited with former manager Louis van Gaal at Manchester United as an understudy for David De Gea.

DEFENDERS

Marc Muniesa (Stoke City)

Barcelona 2002-2013

The defender was the second youngest player to feature for Barca's first team when he played against Osasuna in May 2009 at the tender age of 17 years and 57 days.

Despite such a promising start, he was unable to break into Pep Guardiola's side on a regular basis, playing mainly for the B side in the lower leagues.

Sensing his chance was unlikely to come, Muniesa joined Stoke City on a free transfer in July 2013, linking up with another former Barcelona player, Mark Hughes.

Hector Bellerin (Arsenal)

Barcelona 2003-2011

The attack-minded left-back has shot to prominence this season with his first appearances in Arsene Wenger's first team - but he learned his craft at Barcelona.

Born in the city, Bellerin spent eight years at the club before switching to Arsenal's academy in 2011, signing his first professional contract two years later.

Damia Abella (Middlesbrough)

Barcelona 2004-2006

Abella has been unfortunate with injuries since his arrival at Middlesbrough and has been restricted to just half-a-dozen appearances in Aitor Karanka's side.

He played for Barcelona a decade ago though was never able to break into the first team squad and spent much of his two years at Camp Nou in the B team.

After leaving there, he forged a successful career with Racing Santander, Real Betis and Osasuna before arriving in the north-east.

Ignasi Miquel (Norwich City)

Barcelona 1999-2004

The Barcelona-born defender spent five years in the La Masia academy between the ages of seven and 12 before being released to lower league club Cornella.

He switched to Arsenal's academy in 2008 and made a handful of first-team appearances in the 2011-12 and 2012-13 seasons.

But further opportunities didn't materialise and, following a loan spell at Leicester City, Miquel arrived at Norwich in the summer of 2014.

MIDFIELDERS

Cesc Fabregas (Chelsea)

Barcelona 1997-2003; 2011-2014

A local lad and Barcelona fan from birth, Fabregas joined their La Masia academy at the age of 10 alongside the likes of Lionel Messi and Gerard Pique.

Despite scoring regularly for the youth teams, he sensed his first-team breakthrough would be a long time coming and signed for Arsenal in September 2003.

There, he quickly progressed to the first team and matured to one of the best midfielders in the world.

He was a World Cup-winner by the time he returned to Barcelona in 2011, for a fee in the region of £30m. Spent three seasons alongside the likes of Xavi and Iniesta in the midfield before coming to Chelsea.

Yaya Toure (Manchester City)

Barcelona 2007-2010

The powerful Ivorian joined Barcelona from Monaco in 2007 and soon established himself as Barcelona's midfield rock upon which their creative players could depend.

He made 117 appearances over three seasons and helped Barca to two Liga titles, the Copa del Rey and the Champions League in 2009.

His departure to Manchester City in 2010 disappointed many Barca fans but Toure has gone from strength to strength in the Premier League.

Mikel Arteta (Arsenal)

Barcelona 1997-2002

Given his subsequent success in the Premier League, it's often forgotten that Arteta started out at Barcelona.

He joined their academy from Basque club Antiguoko in 1997 and despite appearances for the C team and the B team he was never quite able to make that next step.

His career began to flourish when on loan at Paris Saint-Germain, then at Rangers before he developed into the talented midfielder he is today.

Alex Song (West Ham on loan)

Barcelona 2012-

Cameroonian midfielder Song is on loan at West Ham from Barcelona for this season and has been in excellent form.

After six years at Arsenal, Barca splashed out £15m to bring him to Catalonia in 2012. Song has to date made 65 appearances for the club, winning La Liga in 2013.

Jordi Gomez (Sunderland)

Barcelona 2003-2007

The central midfielder's football education occurred mainly at Barcelona though it was their city neighbours Espanyol who gave him his professional debut.

While there, he spent a highly-successful season on loan at Swansea City, helping establish them as a Championship club under Roberto Martinez.

Gomez stayed in England, joining Wigan on a permanent basis and proved instrumental in their unexpected FA Cup triumph in 2013. He joined Sunderland last year.

Jon Toral (Brentford on loan from Arsenal)

Barcelona 2003-2011

Toral was scouted while playing for youth side Santes Creus and joined Barcelona at the age of eight. He forged a successful midfield partnership with Sergi Samper and they played together for eight years in the youth ranks.

He caught the eye of Arsenal while playing in the Manchester United Premier Cup of 2010 and they signed him alongside Bellerin a year later.

Although yet to make a first-team appearance for the Gunners, 20-year-old Toral is spending a year on loan at Brentford in the Championship to gain experience.

Andrea Orlandi (Blackpool)

Barcelona 2005-2007

Attacking midfielder Orlandi hails from Barcelona but only made one first-team appearance for the club during a loan spell there from Basque side Alaves in the mid-noughties.

His greatest achievements came in Britain, where he helped Swansea into the Premier League and also played for Brighton before joining Blackpool.

FORWARDS

Alexis Sanchez (Arsenal)

Barcelona 2011-2014

The Chilean had been impressive for Udinese, forming a highly-productive partnership with Italy striker Antonio Di Natale.

His performances persuaded Barcelona to pay £25m for him in the summer of 2011 but despite being one of the best on the planet, he wasn't guaranteed a place in Barca's front line.

Nonetheless, Alexis scored 47 times in 141 appearances for the club during his three seasons there before leaving for Arsenal, where he has so far been exceptional.

Bojan Krkic (Stoke City)

Barcelona 1999-2011

Before a serious knee injury that could rule him out for three months, Bojan was enjoying an encouraging first season with Stoke City following his move from Barca last summer.

He had been a major fixture in the side having emerged from the academy in 2007, winning three La Liga titles and two Champions League crowns, but the opportunities slowly dwindled.

In three unsettled years before arriving at Stoke he went to Roma, then Milan on loan, then back to Barcelona, and then immediately out to Ajax.

Eidur Gudjohnsen (Bolton Wanderers)

Barcelona 2006-2009

The former Iceland international has played in quite a few places across Europe, including three years at Barcelona between 2006 and 2009.

Signed for about £9m from Chelsea to replace Henrik Larsson, he didn't have a particularly prolific scoring record, with just 18 in 112 outings.

He did, however, help Barcelona win the Champions League in 2009, becoming the first from his country to do so.
