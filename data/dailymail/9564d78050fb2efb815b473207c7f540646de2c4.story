Tesco is hoarding enough undeveloped land to build 15,000 new homes.

The supermarket chain reportedly owns 310 sites which it has not built on – a total area of 1,100 acres.

It bought hundreds of out-of-town sites in the 1990s and 2000s, most of them earmarked for its large Tesco Extra stores.

But the company has since changed tack, opting instead for smaller convenience-style stores as shoppers give up their big weekly visits.

It has, however, hung on to its property portfolio, according to analysis of Land Registry records by the Guardian.

Britain needs to build more than 200,000 new homes a year to cope with huge demand and ease the bubble in house prices. The Government is under political pressure to protect rural and green belt land – but there is a shortage of viable brownfield sites.

Companies which hoard land without building on it are fuelling the problem, but finding a solution has divided the political parties. Labour advocates a ‘use-it-or-lose-it’ policy but the Government says confiscating land ‘will not help build a single house’.

The extent of Tesco’s combined undeveloped land is the equivalent of three Hyde Parks, or enough to build the Government’s planned new garden city at Ebbsfleet, Kent.

According to the Guardian, Tesco has accumulated large amounts of unused land in close proximity to existing superstores and turned down offers for at least one site from rivals, despite having no plans to develop the land.

The revelations come three weeks after the supermarket announced its worst results for 20 years, with sales falling by 3.8 per cent over the past three months.

Philip Clarke, Tesco chief executive, says he is facing the worst trading environment in his 40-year history

Tesco chief executive Philip Clarke has to face shareholders at the firm’s annual meeting today. He says the trading environment is the worst in his 40-year career at the supermarket, but added: ‘I am not going anywhere.’

Supermarkets’ land ownership strategies were investigated by the Competition Commission in 2007, when the major chains faced allegations they were buying up land to prevent rivals from building stores in key spots.

Tesco, which has a £20billion property portfolio, was cleared by the commission of impeding its competitors.

Tesco, as well as the other big chains Asda, Sainsbury’s and Morrisons 
are facing fierce competition from discount firms Aldi and Lidl, which 
are aggressively increasing their market share.

A Tesco spokesman said last night: ‘We only buy land with the intention of delivering developments.

‘Like other supermarkets, we own a pipeline of sites where we intend to develop new stores for our customers over the coming years. We have plans for 3,200 homes on land we own. Not all land is suitable for housing.

‘In response to changing customer shopping habits, we have decided to reduce the amount of new space we build each year, building fewer large stores.

‘Where we no longer intend to develop sites, we sell them, lease them or develop them for housing.’
