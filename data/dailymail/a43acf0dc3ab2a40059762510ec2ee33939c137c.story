He is best known for wrapping the Reichstag in fabric and lining California highways with yellow umbrellas - but Christo's latest, almost inconceivable project will dwarf them both.

The artist will spend £212m building the 'Mastaba', the world's largest permanent sculpture, from over 400,000 multi-coloured oil barrels in the middle of the desert near Abu Dhabi.

The flat-topped pyramid will be 492ft high, just taller than the Great Pyramid of Giza and three times the height of Nelson's Column.

It is intended to be a landmark for Abu Dhabi - despite being 100 miles from the city itself - in the same way the pyramids are for Egypt and the Eiffel Tower is to Paris, with two million visitors expected annually.

Christo and his late wife Jeanne-Claude first envisaged the project 30 years ago, after being inspired by the colourful sands of the desert but its completion has been delayed by various conflicts in the region.

The Mastaba chimes with Abu Dhabi's latest ambition to turn itself into a centre of art and culture.

The emirate's rulers have approved a site near Liwa oasis, in the south-east of the United Arab Emirates close to the border with Oman.

The region is home to some of the highest sand dunes in the middle-east and the yellow and red colours in the sand have inspired the design.

Christo said: 'When the sun rises, the vertical wall will become almost full of gold.'

Stack: The Mastaba will be made of 410,000 multi-coloured oil barrels, though Christo insists it is not a commentary on the region's oil wealth

Long-held dream: The first sketches of the 490ft flat-topped pyramid structure were drawn up 30 years ago, but conflicts in the region have stalled its construction

The Bulgarian-born artist, 74, is collaborating with Sheikh Hamdan bin Zayed al-Nayhan, the crown prince’s elder brother, with the royal family ‘very excited to realise the project.’

Although Christo hasn’t said whether the ruling family have contributed financially towards it, he said it had mainly been financed ‘independently’ and through sales of his work.

He denied that choosing oil barrels to build the structure was a comment on the region’s chief source of wealth and stressed that his idea was not born out of economic or political events, just ‘joy and beauty.’

Location: The Mastaba will be situated here, with the yellow and red colours of the sands said to have inspired Christo in his design

Plans: The Mastaba is slightly taller than the Great Pyramid of Gaza in Egypt. Christo and the project's backers hope it will attract two million visitors a year

It has been inspired by Islamic architecture, with Christo saying: ‘When Louis XIV was building that kitschy castle Versailles, the greatest architecture in the Middle East had incredible simplicity… and play with colours.’

Construction of the Mastaba will take 30 months, with hundreds of people involved. A German company has been commissioned to supply the coloured barrels.

A nearby ‘art campus’ will include an exhibition on the project, as well as housing a luxury hotel and restaurant.

Christo, born Christo Javacheff, is best known for wrapping everyday items including bottles and chairs in sheets or tarpaulin.

He famously wrapped the Reichstag, the German government building in Berlin, and the Pont-Neuf Bridge in Paris in fabric.

His ‘Umbrellas’ project, between 1984 and 1991, involved setting up 3,000 umbrellas along highways in Japan and the United States.

Surrounded Islands, 1983

A two week installation in Biscayne Bay, Miami to surround 11 islands with 1.98m square feet of pink floating plastic.

The luminous pink colour of the fabric proved a great hit with everyone who could see it from the surrounding islands, beaches and causeways.

In total, 430 workers fitted the 11km of plastic and 120 monitors watched it day and night.

Pont Neuf, Paris (1985)After nine years of negotiations with the then mayor of Paris, Jacques Chirac, Christo received permission to 'wrap' one of the most picturesque bridges in the French capital.

It needed 130,000 square feet of sand-coloured fabric to cover and took just under a month to complete.

Three million people came to have a look in the ensuing two weeks.

The plans was to line highways in California and Japan with yellow and blue umbrellas respectively at the same time.

Two thousand workers were brought in during September 1991 to install the umbrellas into their reinforced metal bases at a cost of £16m.

By September 7, 1991, there were 1,340 blue umbrellas in Ibaraki, Japan and 1,760 yellow umbrellas at the Tejon Ranch in southern California.

Three million people saw the six-metre high installations and became a huge tourist attraction.

On October 26, 1991, one of the umbrellas broke loose in high winds, killing one woman and injuring several others. The installation was immediately closed.

Cloaked: Christo's most famous work, covering the Reichstag in Berlin in white fabric in 1995

The Reichstag, Berlin (1995)His best known project, Christo and wife Jeanne-Claude wrapped the German parliament building in fabric in the summer of 1995, attracting five million visitors.

They sought the support of the President of the Parliament, Rita Sussmuth, and all 662 delegates of the Bundestag by writing and phoning them.

They received permission following a 70-minute debate in the parliament on February 25, 1995.

It involves 1,076,000 square feet of white fabric and 15km of rope to completely cloak the building.
