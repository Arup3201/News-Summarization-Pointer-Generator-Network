Over the past week the UK has basked in the warmest weather of the year so far.

But, as this satellite image clearly shows, Britain's weather took a dramatic turn for the worst today.

Fierce winds of up to 60mph have been sweeping in from the Atlantic and battering the country.

As clearly demonstrated below, much of the UK has been affected by the unseasonable weather, with western parts of England hit hardest.

Concerns: The Met Office has issued a yellow weather warning for many parts of the country, while the Highways Agency has put an amber warning in place

Motorists have been urged to take care 
in strong cross-winds on the roads with branches and treesÂ  also likely be brought 
down by the weather.

The
Met Office has issued a yellow weather warning for many parts of the 
country, while the Highways Agency has put an amber warning in place.

Affected areas include Wales, the South West, South East, London and the Midlands.

Forecasters say the winds are caused by an 'unusually' deep area of low pressure, which is moving west from Northern Ireland.

Coastal and exposed areas could see gusts of up to 60mph, with winds reaching between 40mph and 55mph inland.

Claire
Austin, a forecaster with MeteoGroup, the weather division of the Press
Association, said the worst of the wind and rain would be experienced 
throughout today.

She said: 'The strongest of the winds are going to be from late morning to this afternoon.

'We
could see gusts of up to 50mph and over in inland Wales and the South 
West. If you go further to coastal and exposed places such as the South 
Coast gusts could reach up to 60mph.

'We
have a band of rain coming through and we have gusty winds coming 
through. It looks as though the heaviest of the rain should be coming at
about 3pm.

'The rain will come through quite 
quickly. It might be intense rain with downpours for a time. It is not 
very long lived. It will probably come down quite heavy with showers 
when it clears this evening.'

A yellow weather warning has been issued
by the Met Office until 9pm this evening, when it is expected that the 
winds and rain will have calmed.

The
warning originally covered Wales, South West England and the South 
Coast but has now been extended to parts of Eastern England, covering 
Hertfordshire to East Anglia.

Mark
Seltzer, a forecaster with the Met Office, said: 'All the winds are 
caused by a deep area of low pressure coming in from the west.

'It is unusually deep for this time 
of year. Normally we don't see this sorts of winds often at this time of
year. It is arriving moving slowly westwards, it is currently centred 
over Northern Ireland.

'It 
is going to slowly edge over the UK. The winds are picking up over 
south-west Cornwall as we speak.

'The winds will strengthen throughout 
the course of the day throughout most of the South of England.

'The
strongest gusts will be around the coastal areas and hills of the South
West and South West Wales. Later they will move across the South Coast 
towards Kent at the end of the day.

'Our main focus is the risk of 
disruption to transport, due to cross winds on roads. We suspect there 
will be a lot of people on the roads coming back from the Bank Holiday 
in caravans and cars. Our advice to motorists would be to slow down.'

Mr Seltzer said the winds could pull down branches and trees and would be accompanied by 'driving rain'.

He
added: 'The winds will still be brisk in the evening and overnight but 
they will be at their strongest during daylight hours.'

The Highways Agency has issued an 
amber alert for high-sided vehicles, caravans and motorbikes due to the 
strong winds between 12pm and 5pm.

In a statement, the agency said there was an 'increased risk of vehicles being blown over'.

'The
Highways Agency, which is responsible for motorways and other major 
trunk roads in England, is working closely with the Met Office to 
monitor weather conditions and maintain safe roads and reliable 
journeys,' it said.

'Drivers
are advised to plan for their journey before they set out, checking the
forecast and road conditions, to leave extra time if travel conditions 
are poor and to delay their journey if the weather becomes severe.'

A rare white rainbow streak, named a fog bow, was captured by keen mountaineer Dan 
Arkle during a trip to Burbage Valley, near Sheffield, South Yorkshire.

Speaking about his astonishing 
picture of the white rainbow, Mr Arkle said: 'I got up early to 
photograph the dawn. I had almost finished and was about to go home when
I saw the fogbow.

'It seemed very close - about 40 foot away, and it had an almost supernatural glow to it.

'I
realised this was a rare opportunity, so put my camera on a tripod and 
captured the picture. After just a few seconds, it vanished.'

A fog bow is a similar phenomenon to a rainbow, but it appears as an arch in fog rather than rain.

Due to the size of the tiny water droplets that cause fog, it appears as a white arc, rather than a multi-coloured one.

Mr
Arkle, 35, added: 'I was really pleased to be able to capture it so 
accurately, which is just as well as I've not seen one since.'
