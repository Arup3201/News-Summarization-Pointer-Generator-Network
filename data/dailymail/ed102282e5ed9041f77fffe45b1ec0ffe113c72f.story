LeBron James may have left Miami, but Chris Bosh has committed his future to the Heat after agreeing a five-year contract worth around $118million (£68.9m).

Bosh insisted all along that he didn't want to leave the Florida franchise, and not even James' decision to return home to the Cleveland Cavaliers changed his mind.

Miami are now intent on tying up a deal for Dwyane Wade, the other member of their 'big three'.

James, Wade and Bosh led Miami to back-to-back NBA titles as they dominated the league for two seasons.

Their reign came to a crashing end, though, when they were blown away by San Antonio Spurs in this year's NBA Finals.

And with James' departure to the Cavaliers, Bosh may benefit from more shots and a bigger role in the Heat offensive scheme.

Bosh averaged 16.2 points on 52 per cent shooting last season, and averages 19.2 points per game during his 11-year NBA career.

Heat President Pat Riley said: 'While I am disappointed by LeBron's decision to leave Miami, no one can fault another person for wanting to return home.

'LeBron is a fantastic leader, athlete, team-mate and person, and we are all sorry to see him go.'

After weeks, if not months, of speculation, James announced his decision to rejoin Cleveland four years after leaving to Sports Illustrated on Friday.

'I looked at other teams, but I wasn't going to leave Miami for anywhere except Cleveland,' James told SI. 'The more time passed, the more it felt right. This is what makes me happy.

'When I left Cleveland, I was on a mission,' James added. 'I was seeking championships, and we won two. But Miami already knew that feeling. 

'Our city hasn't had that feeling in a long, long, long time. My goal is still to win as many titles as possible, no question. But what's most important for me is bringing one trophy back to Northeast Ohio.'
