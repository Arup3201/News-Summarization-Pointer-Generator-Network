This is the terrifying moment a cyclist hurtles through the air before landing on his feet after colliding with a car.

The dramatic footage, taken on the rider's head-cam, shows the man cycling along a road in Romford, Essex.

A car then pulls across his path - sending him and his bike flying through the air.

Head-cam footage shows a cyclist riding along a road in Romford, Essex when a car (top) pulls in to his path

In heart-stopping footage, the man can be seen slamming on his breaks as the car pulls in front of him

The unnamed man then crashes down on the bonnet of the car - before sliding off and landing on his feet.

Thankfully, he appears to be unscathed - and can be seen back chatting to a roadside witness just seconds after the crash.

The footage has been posted on YouTube by the cyclist, known by his username Cycle Jack, who said he was travelling at 22mph along the road when he was hit.

The footage has emerged following the deaths of two cyclists on roads in Greater London within a days of each other.

The cyclist wrote on YouTube: 'The second time I rode into London in an effort to gain some fitness, rather than take the train ended like this.

'I was travelling around 22mph through Romford. Drizzly conditions so I was being cautious around bends and roundabouts. I didn’t expect this!

'I just about got my hands to the brakes (it can just be seen on the frame before impact) but I had no chance of stopping.

'I’m not quite sure how I wasn’t seen. I’m over 6ft and was wearing a bright blue jacket. If I was seen then it’s a very bad judgement in my speed.

'After a very uncomfortable trip to the hospital in a neck brace and spinal board and various x-rays I escaped with just bruising. So I consider myself lucky.

The footage then pans to the aftermath of the crash - with the bike, minus its front wheel, lying in the road in front of the car. It comes as two cyclists were hit and killed Greater London in recent weeks

'At the time the driver was apologetic and was informed by the police that I was recording my ride and seemed to admit fault.

'But when it came to my insurance claim against her she disputed it.

'Safe to say the video has saved me a lot of hassle and 3 weeks later the cheque has already arrived from the insurance company.

'My four week old Giant bike was written off but thanks to the guys at Cycle Store they put me one of the two they had left aside and I’m looking forward to getting back out there.'
