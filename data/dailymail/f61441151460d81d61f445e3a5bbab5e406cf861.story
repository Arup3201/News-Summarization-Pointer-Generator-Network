The NSW Government has spent more than $500,000 ensuring its workers can continue using an outdated Windows operating system.

Eight state agencies are included in the new contract, which will allow public sector workers to persist with Windows XP, four-and-a-half years after Windows 7 was made available.

The arrangement covers ServiceFirst, NSW Health, NSW Fire and Rescue, NSW Police, Transport for NSW, Department of Trade and Investment, Department of Family and Community Services, Endeavour Energy and Energy Australia.

According to Vulture South, the new government contract will last for the rest of 2014 and up until April 2015.

"No additional licences were purchased as part of this arrangement. The contract value is AU$519,991 (estimated value of the goods and services over the term of the contract)," a spokesperson for the Office of Finance and Services said. 

Extended Microsoft support for the Windows 7 ended in April this year. 

Microsoft posted a statement to their online site outlining why they have decided to put an end to all Windows XP support. 

'Microsoft provided support for Windows XP for the past 12 years. But the time came for us, along with our hardware and software partners, to invest our resources toward supporting more recent technologies so that we can continue to deliver great new experiences.'

'As a result, technical assistance for Windows XP is no longer available, including automatic updates that help protect your PC.'

Microsoft also outlined the security risks people were taking should they wish to continue with Windows XP.

Security holes in Windows XP have increased over the years due to a lack of interest in the system from security operators who have since focused their attention on Windows 7. This has made the operating system an easy shot for hackers targeting government information

'If you continue to use Windows XP now that support has ended, your computer will still work but it might become more vulnerable to security risks and viruses,'

Security holes in Windows XP have increased over the years due to a lack of interest in the system from security operators who have since focused their attention on Windows 7.

This has made the operating system an easy shot for hackers targeting government information. 

The NSW Government joins Victoria Police in holding on to the dated operating system. 

Victoria Police defended its decision to continue using Windows XP until the end of the year, claiming it does not elevate the company's risk.  

There were reports that Victoria Police coughed up almost $200-per-desktop to keep their staff using Windows XP.
