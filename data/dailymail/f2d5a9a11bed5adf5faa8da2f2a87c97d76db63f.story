Many women may dream of having legs that go on forever. For Alexandra Robertson, however, it’s no dream – it’s reality.

With her astonishing 47in pins, the British model is helping the nation inch ahead in the battle of the long-limbed beauties.

Miss Robertson, 20, decided to find out how she measured up after Russian trainee lawyer Anastasia Strashevskaya scooped her nation’s Miss Longest Legs, with a seemingly unbeatable 42in.

Impressive: Alexandra Robertson, 20, has legs that measure 47" - five inches longer than Ms. Strashveskaya

Model: Alexandra was signed up by a local agency after winning Miss Blackpool at the age of 18

And she was amazed to find  out that hers were a full five inches longer.

Miss
 Robertson, who stands a statuesque 6ft 1in and is juggling a musical 
theatre degree with work as a model, said: ‘It is crazy – I had no idea 
my legs were quite that long.’

It is not only her perfect pins that will make her the envy of women everywhere. She is also a 34 DD and wears size 10 dresses.

Miss
 Robertson, from Blackpool, began her modelling career at 18, when she 
entered a competition in her home city. She was spotted by a local 
agency and has gone on to model bridal wear and lingerie.

She
 said: ‘I do get some stares and I suppose I do intimidate men 
sometimes, especially in my high heels, but it’s not intentional. I 
often hear things like “do you play basketball?” but I just turn around 
and reply “no, do you play mini-golf?” and we end up having a laugh.’

Fortunately Miss Robertson’s height doesn’t intimidate her boyfriend of two years, Laurson Moston, 21.

At
 6ft, he is only an inch shorter than her. ‘He doesn’t mind  my height 
at all,’ she said.  ‘He did ban me from wearing really high heels when 
I’m with him, though, because I tower over him then.’

Being tall is something of a family trait. Miss Robertson’s sister Lorna Rycroft, 33, is the same height as her.

But
 it also has its pitfalls. Miss Robertson said: ‘Getting clothes to fit,
 especially fashion clothes, is a bit of a nightmare.’

Karen Jean Cookson, who runs Miss Robertson’s modelling agency Angels Elite, said she ‘has a fabulous personality’.
