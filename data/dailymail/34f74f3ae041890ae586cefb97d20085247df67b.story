A disabled Iraqi war veteran is suing a Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurant in the Bronx for refusing him service when he brought in his service dog.

50-year-old Charles Hernandez says he entered the location on Fordham Road and Jerome Avenue on February 26 to buy a two-piece chicken meal with fries in order to take some prescribed medication.

But he was refused service when the employees behind the counter saw that he was accompanied by his service dog, Valor.

'Papi, there are no dogs allowed,' Hernandez recalls an employee saying.

Hernandez tried to explain that Valor is a service dog and according to the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), Valor is allowed to accompany him anywhere.

'OK, but you still cannot have the dog in the store,' the employee responded.

Hernandez even says that the store's manager, Sade Clark, saw the 'discrimination' happening and did nothing about it.

'I was frustrated, angry and more, depressed,' Hernandez told the New York Post. 'No one was helping. Rather than understanding the needs of a person, they shut me out.'

So Hernandez is now suing the employee, Clark, the restaurant's owner and the company's principal owner for $1million.

Sued: This KFC in the Bronx was slapped with a $1million lawsuit yesterday for refusing Hernandez and his dog Valor service last February

In a lawsuit filed in Manhattan federal court Wednesday, Hernandez alleges that the KFC worker broke federal, state and city laws and caused him distress.

Hernandez won a similar case in 2011 after being cursed out by a McDonald's store manager in Times Square for entering with his service dog.

'It's unfortunate that when disabled veterans return from war...they are confronted with ignorance and discrimination,' Hernandez's lawyer David Lackowitz told the New York Daily News.

Hernandez was deployed to Iraq from 2004 to 2006 and sustained multiple injuries to his shoulder and his back. A spinal chord injury led to his early retirement.

Hernandez also worked at Ground Zero for three months after the September 11th attacks and was named 'City Council Veteran of the Year' in 2011.

In 2010 he was given Valor to held him with balance and prevent his panic attacks.Â
