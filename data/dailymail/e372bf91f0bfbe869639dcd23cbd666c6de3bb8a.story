A police special protection officer has been found shot dead at a house in London.

The 43 year old PC, from the Specialist Protection Command, was found at the address in Camden yesterday afternoon.

The unit covers protection duties for VIPs including the Prime Minister.

Horrific: Police officers forced their way into a property and found the body of the 43-year-old man with a gunshot injury

The Metropolitan Police said that the death is not being treated as suspicious. An investigation is now underway which will look at whether a police firearm was involved.

The Met Police would not confirm or deny this evening if the officer would have had access to a police weapon.

The officer, who has not been named, is thought to have moved with his 
girlfriend to the cobbled mews tucked away in Camden less 
than two years ago.

Neighbours said they arrived home from work to see the front door of the
converted mews house smashed in and murder detectives stationed 
outside.

A neighbour who lived upstairs but did not want to comment said: 
'Yesterday the police turned up, the front door was smashed in and so 
was the front of the door of the flat where the couple lived. I assumed 
there had been a burglary, I didn't realise it was as serious as it is.

'I didn't know them. They were a young middle aged couple, they were a 
professional couple. I just found out he was a police officer but I 
didn't know that before.

High profile: The officer found dead yesterday worked for Protection Command, which is responsible for protecting VIPs, including the Prime Minister. This is a file picture

'It was very unexpected, we have never had any trouble or disturbances 
before. It is shocking. It is upsetting for the family, they are only a 
young couple.'

Police officers went door to door to ask neighbours if they had heard anything and requested CCTV from nearby shops and offices.

Another man who lives in the street said: 'There were four homicide 
officers here last night and a couple of uniformed officers. They went 
door to door to all the neighbours in the street and asked us if we had 
heard anything.

'They just said something serious had happened. They didn't say he had 
been shot but you could in infer by the amount officers in the area.'

A Met Police spokesman said: 'At 4.04pm on Tuesday, 19 February 2013, police went 
to a residential address in Camden following concerns about the 
occupant.

'Officers forced entry to the property in King's Terrace and found the body of a man with a gunshot injury.

'The man was pronounced dead at 4.45pm.

'He was a 43-year-old PC in the MPS Specialist Protection Command which is part of Specialist Operations.'

The man was not under investigation 
as part of either the 'plebgate' probe or the inquiries into alleged 
phone hacking and corrupt payments to public officials.

Specialist
Operations is divided into three sections which are known as commands. 
Within the three commands are several units which are used for 
protection.

The officer 
found dead yesterday worked for Protection Command, which is made up of 
three units. They are responsible for protection for ministers and public officials deemed to be at threat from 
terrorism. This includes visiting heads of government and public 
figures.

The spokesman added that next of kin have been informed.

Officers from the MPS Directorate of 
Professional Standards (DPS) are investigating. They will prepare a 
report for the coroner in due course.

A post mortem examination will be held and an inquest will be opened and adjourned shortly.

The Independent Police Complaints Commission has been informed.
