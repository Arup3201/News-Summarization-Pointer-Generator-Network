Oscar Garcia has left English football to take over at Maccabi Tel Aviv, having only departed the Israeli champions a year ago.

The Spaniard resigned from his job at Brighton less than a month ago following a disappointing play-off defeat against Derby County.

Garcia had only been at the Amex Stadium for 11 months but decided he couldn't take the Seagulls into the Premier League.

Mover and shaker: Oscar Garcia has decided to head back to Maccabi Tel Aviv after a year away

Keen: Garcia told Sportsmail last month that he was flattered to be linked with the vacant Celtic job

He is highly thought of and was interesting Celtic as a replacement for Neil Lennon, but Garcia has opted for a move back to Israel.

That is despite the 41-year-old telling Sportsmail that he was flattered to be linked with the vacant position in Glasgow a fortnight ago, while he was linked with the Southampton job.

This will be his third job in as many years after he resigned at Maccabi upon winning the club's first league title for a decade in May 2013.

But his venture into England didn't go quite as smoothly as planned as Brighton failed to win promotion from the Championship despite being among the pre-season favourites.

Maccabi are in next season's Champions League qualifying stage after winning the title under Paulo Sousa, who recent sealed a deal to become the new boss at Swiss side FC Basle.
