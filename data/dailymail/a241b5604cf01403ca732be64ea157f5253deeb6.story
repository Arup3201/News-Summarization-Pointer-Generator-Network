Rattled by the massive protest at Raisina Hill and a tight rap by Congress president Sonia Gandhi over the gang rape incident, the home ministry and the Delhi Police swung into action on Saturday evening, announcing a slew of measures to make the Capital a safer place for women.

Home minister Sushil Kumar Shinde announced the setting up a commission of inquiry to review the response of the security agencies after the shocking gang rape was reported.

The minister assured the people that the government will take steps to amend the Criminal Procedure Code to enhance punishment in the "rarest of rare rape cases", stopping short of stating if it meant death penalty for rapists.

He also announced the appointment of a judicial commission to review women's security. The measures, which should have been announced much earlier, came after a miffed Congress top brass pulled up the authorities for "poor" handling of anti-rape protesters by the Delhi Police on Saturday.

The party's concern was articulated by none other than Sonia, who spoke to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh in the evening, demanding swift action in the case.

She also wanted the PM to ask the home minister to ensure that all steps are taken to protect the victim.

Congress sources said Sonia also spoke to Shinde and expressed her displeasure at the inaction of the ministry and the police.

She asked him to take the "severest" action against the alleged rapists. She said she had been following the case daily and is learnt to have demanded justice to be "fast-tracked".

Several senior Congress leaders watched with unease on television as the police fired water jets, lobbed tear gas shells and resorted to lathi-charge on demonstrators, comprising mostly college students, who had gathered at India Gate and Raisina Hill to protest against the gang rape of the 23-year-old girl.

The police crackdown was perhaps the biggest the city has seen after the anti-Mandal agitation of 1991.

At least 72 people were injured, including 37 policemen. One constable and an RPF inspector suffered serious head injuries.

Two DCPs were also reported to be injured in the protests. Security forces fired a total of 125 tear gas shells in seven sessions during the day.

Two government vehicles, a Delhi Police bus, six public buses and two motorcycles were reported to have been damaged in the protests.

The protests started on a peaceful note with thousands of protesters marching from India Gate to Rashtrapati Bhavan, carrying placards and raising slogans against the city and the Union government.

"Stop raping India. Change the law," read one of the placards. When the police tried to stop the protesters from jumping over the barricades at Raisina Hill, the agitation turned violent, forcing the police to resort to mob control measures.

Television channels went viral capturing the police action, which drew criticism from different sections of the society, denting the image of the police further. The home minister said the protesters had gathered for a just cause and claimed the government had taken a serious view of the sentiment of the people.

He also assured that the lathi-charge on the protesters would be probed and claimed itwas resorted to only after some people tried to bring down the security barricades. The government has asked police commissioner Neeraj Kumar to give an explanation on the police action by Monday.

Further, he has been asked to explain how the OB vans of channels entered the high-security Rajpath and India Gate without prior information.

Top Congress sources confirmed their dissatisfaction with Kumar's handling of the entire case and the agitation. Too little Shinde announced five policemen will be suspended.

Half-an-hour later, the Delhi Police said a total of eight cops have been suspended in connection with the case.

Those taken off duty were, however, junior- level policemen, including one sub-inspector and seven constable and head constable-rank policeman.

The action is unlikely to soothe the rising tempers of Delhiites.

The agitators wanted the responsibility of the gang rape to be fixed at the top of the police hierarchy and those in the home ministry.

However, it seems, the senior officers are being spared the flak by making junior policemen the scapegoat.
