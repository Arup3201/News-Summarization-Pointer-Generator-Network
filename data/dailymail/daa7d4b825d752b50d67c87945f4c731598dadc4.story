Ronda Rousey has squashed talk of the prospect of her ever fighting a male opponent in a UFC octagon.

The 28-year-old is the talk of the sport at the moment as she continues to dominate the women's UFC bantamweight division.

Rousey currently boasts an 11-0 record in the sport having defeated Cat Zingano in just 14 seconds in her most recent contest on February 28.

Last month's rapid victory began theories about how the undefeated 135-pound division champion would fare against the opposite sex.

But during an interview with a UFC interactive panel at the SXSW festival on Monday, Rousey shot down notions.

'There should never (be) a venue where we're celebrating a man hitting a woman,' she told the panel.

Rousey's words were greeted with cheers and applause as UFC President Dana White echoed her sentiments by adding: 'With our organisation, she'll never fight a man.'
