An inquest heard how a mother put her healthy toddler to bed one night and found him dead the next morning.

Stephanie Ballantine from Halesowen, West Midlands, said yesterday that her son had been behaving 'normally' the night before his tragic death on December 28 in the Spanish holiday resort of Playa de las Americas.

Alfie Brown died of natural causes while on a family holiday in Tenerife last year.

Stephanie Ballantine said her son's tragic death was 'sudden'. She described putting him to bed one evening only to find him dead the following morning.

His mother, Miss Ballantine, 19, said: 'It was completely sudden. I put him to bed the night before and found him the next morning.'

She told the inquest at Smethwick Council House that Alfie, aged just 14 months when he died, had been playing by the pool 'all day'.

Miss Ballantine, who is expecting another child, described Alfie's development as 'completely normal', saying that he had passed medical check-ups 'with flying colours.'

She was joined yesterday by her parents, who were also on the holiday, and Alfie's father Matthew Brown.

A consultant perinatal pathologist at Birmingham Women's Hospital carried out a post mortem into Alfie's death on January 10.

Dr Phillip Cox said that his death had been caused by bronchitis with bronchial pneumonia.

'It appears to have come on very quickly, but was widespread,” he said. 'We didn’t manage to find out what the organism causing the infection was.'

Dr Cox ruled out an exotic foreign virus as the likely cause, suggesting that Alfie's death had been the result of a 'nasty virus infection' which originated in the UK.

He added that Alfie had 'more likely' died as the result of a bacterial infection.

Black Country coroner Robin Balmain, said: 'There is nothing unnatural about his death. It's terribly distressing, I understand that, but it's not unnatural.'

He told Miss Ballantine and Mr Brown: 'I am really sorry that this has happened to you. I can't imagine what a shock it was to you both.'
