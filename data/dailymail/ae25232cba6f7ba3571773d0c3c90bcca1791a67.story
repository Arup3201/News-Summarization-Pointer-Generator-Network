A toddler has died after choking on food at his home.

North West Ambulance Service attended but, despite the efforts of paramedics, the boy died shortly after arrival at the Royal Preston Hospital.

Tragedy: Manor House Close in the Moss Side area of Leyland, Lancashire, where a child is believed to have died after choking on food

An investigation is underway but at this stage the death is not being treated as suspicious, Lancashire Police confirmed.

It is understood that the youngster could have choked on something, possibly an item of food. However, a post mortem examination has yet to take place.

Ambulance service spokesman confirmed they were called to the address at 8.20pm and the boy was taken to hospital by ambulance.

Neighbours in the quiet street yesterday recalled seeing police and ambulances turn up at the address.

One neighbour said: 'I don't know what happened, I saw the ambulance and the police at about 8.30pm.'

A man, who was asleep when the incident unfolded, said his daughter was heading out but couldn't get through because of the emergency services in the street.

The estate is made up of a mixture of houses and flats. It is understood the child lived in one of the houses on the cul-de-sac.

It is not known how long the boy's family has lived at the address. And the name of the boy has not been released.
