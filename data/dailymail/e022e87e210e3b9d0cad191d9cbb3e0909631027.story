A 41-year-old Florida woman has been arrested for having sex with a teenager but she claims the minor seduced her not the other way around.

Lisa O'Neill, who owns a flooring company in Royal Palm Beach, admitted to sleeping with the unnamed boy multiple times over the past 10 months and sending him naked photographs of herself, the Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office said.

But, according to a police report, the married woman said he seduced her while she was under the influence of alcohol.

The woman remained in county jail late on Thursday in lieu of $37,000 bail.

The teen told sheriff's deputies he and O'Neill began flirting in June 2012 after the older woman started texting him about 'sexual stuff.'

According to the Sun Sentinel, he said three months later she threw a party at her house and gave him several Bud Light beers.

He left the party after drinking the alcohol, but she later invited him back to er house over text message and he returned.

The two had sex the first time that night, according to the report.

In the months that followed, the teen asked O'Neill for naked photos and videos of herself, and she complied.

Police recovered seven incriminating photos from the teen's phone. Four of the images were of O'Neill naked and three of her in her underwear.

The pair continued having sex for months, though the boy said only once at his request.

The most recent encounter was in May, when the woman sent the teen a menssage asking him to meet her at a closed Toys R Us store.

At that meeting, O'Neill told the boy that 'she could get in a lot of trouble' if anyone found out about the relationship.

On Wednesday, a deputy appeared at O'Neill's house and asked her to come to the sheriff's office for questionin but she declined and was arrested.

O'Neill faces sexual assault and cruelty toward a child charges. She admitted to deputies that she had sex with the victim and sent the images of herself to him.

The woman runs a flooring business called O'Neill Brothers flooring in the Miami-Dade, Broward and Palm Beach area. It's not clear how old the teen is.
