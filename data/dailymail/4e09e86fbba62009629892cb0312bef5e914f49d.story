'I've got something naughty': Wayne Greenfield, 
27, from South Shields, was sentenced to three months jail after threatening to
blow up his local Jobcentre

A mentally-ill man who threatened to 'blow people up' at his local Jobcentre after his benefits were stopped has been jailed.

Wayne Greenfield from South Shields, South Tyneside, told an operator at the Department of Work and Pensions that he had 'something naughty to go to the Jobcentre and kill them all'.

The 27-year-old had telephoned the benefits agency because his benefits had been stopped and he didn't know why.

But minutes into his call he told the operator he had two grenades and would blow up everyone in the building.

Greenfield was today jailed for three months after pleading guilty to making a threatening or malicious communication at South Tyneside Magistrates' Court.

Magistrates were played a recording of the phone call. During the call, Greenfield, who is schizophrenic, said: 'I've bought something naughty to go to the JobCentre and kill them all.

'It's in my head, I'm trying to sort this out, but people keep cutting me off.

'It's making me want to set grenades off in the JobCentre.

'They were £100 each and I spent all my money on them - I've got two ready to blow people up.'

Lee Poppett, prosecuting, told the court it was on December 14 at 12.20pm when Greenfield called the DWP.

He said: 'During the phone call he said he was in possession of hand grenades and would go into the Jobcentre and kill everyone.

'The call lasted about 16 minutes and during it he said he had been in trouble for having firearms before.

'He told the call handler that he had schizophrenia.

'The DWP staff member reported the call to police and the defendant was arrested.'

The court heard that Greenfield had 
previous convictions for possessing an extendible baton and a weapon for
the release of a noxious gas.

'It's making me want to set grenades off': South
Shields Jobcentre, which Greenfield threatened to blow up. At South 
Tyneside Magistrates' Court he pleaded guilty making a threatening or 
malicious communication

Rachel Mangenie, defending, said: 'This isn't a case where he is ranting and raving and issuing threats.

'This is someone who suffers from mental health problems and has little recollection of the call.

'While they are extremely unpleasant threats to make, they were spoken by someone who was desperate and frustrated - he had been on the phone six or seven times in the previous few days.'

Chairman of the Bench Gerry Tierney said: 'This is a very serious offence, which has crossed the custody threshold.

'We're imposing a custodial sentence for 12 weeks, we don't think there is any other option.'
