Reports in Italy this week claim Puma will help Arsenal to sign Mario Balotelli from AC Milan.

The striker is sponsored by Puma, who also announced a partnership with Arsenal in January.

Balotelli’s
 future at Milan has been thrown into doubt after President Silvio 
Berlusconi confessed it was still to be decided and Sky Sport Italia 
pundit Mario Giunta suggested: 'Arsenal are very interested in Balotelli 
and Arsene Wenger would do anything to bring him to London.

Target: Reports in Italy suggest Puma could help Arsenal sign Mario Balotelli from AC Milan

Balotelli could be about to return to England having left Manchester City last year

'This
 operation could be pushed forward by the technical sponsor, who 
Balotelli shares with Arsenal. To have Balotelli in the Premier League 
for Arsenal would be an important investment.'

Arsene
 Wenger has an admiration for Balotelli but remains keen on Mario 
Mandzukic of Bayern Munich, as first revealed in SportsmailOnline, and 
is watching him play for Croatia in the World Cup, although he is suspended for the opening game against Brazil.

Another target, Alvaro Morata of Real Madrid, is in discussions over a possible move to Villarreal.

Blade Harry could cut it for Tigers as Davies talks continue

Hull City are showing interest in Sheffield United defender Harry Maguire and will open talks with Curtis Davies over a new contract.

The 29-year-old Davies has been outstanding this season and that has attracted interest from Newcastle and Everton.

It is a pivotal contract for Davies who has rebuilt his reputation under Steve Bruce's tutelage after an inauspicious time at Aston Villa which was hampered by poor form and injury. Bruce has made a new centre-back his priority for the summer along with the signing of Jake Livermore.

Tiger time? Sheffield United's Harry Maguire is being tracked by Premier League Hull City

Sportsmail reported last month that Crystal Palace have an interest in Livermore too but the player is keen to return to Hull if they can negotiate a suitable fee with Tottenham. That is not easy and will have a bearing on Bruce's other targets Michael Dawson and Joleon Lescott. Dawson is keen to see whether he has a future at Tottenham first.

Maguire, 21, has been the subject of two failed bids by Wolves and League One Sheffield United want more than the £2m that has been discussed so far.

Pepe is too pricey for Napoli as Spaniard returns to Liverpool

Napoli will struggle to take Pepe Reina back to Italy because of his wages. The Spaniard has returned to Liverpool and is waiting for talks with manager Brendan Rodgers about his future.

Rodgers has been looking to bring in a second goalkeeper to give competition to Simon Mignolet and was looking at Swansea's Michel Vorm until the Welsh club valued him at £8m.

The belief is that Liverpool will look to strike a compromise and maybe subsidise Reina's departure to help him reach agreement with a new club over his salary.

Atletico Madrid did hold an interest but have signed Miguel Moya from neighbours Getafe and may look at Petr Cech in negotiations with Chelsea over Thibaut Courtois. Arsenal have also been contacted although they have spoken to Cardiff about David Marshall too among several others.

Ole eyes Dikgacoi with former Palace midfielder set to join Bluebirds

Cardiff City are in discussions over a deal for South African midfielder Kagisho Dikgacoi. The 29-year-old turned down a new contract at Crystal Palace and is a free agent. He is poised to sign for Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and will become the Norwegian's fifth summer recruit.

Bouremouth have made a second bid for Coventry striker Callum Wilson after having a £1million offer turned down earlier this month.

Millwall have made an improved offer for Halifax Town striker Lee Gregory. They had an initial bid of around £150,000 rejected for the 25-year-old.

Joao's going nowhere for now as Atletico dig heels in

Atletico Madrid are refusing to negotiate over the transfer of centre-back Joao Miranda insisting clubs meet his buy-out clause of £24.2million if they want to buy him.

The Spanish champions are wary that coach Diego Simeone is growing frustrated at the sales taking place with Diego Costa and Filipe Luis heading to Chelsea with free agent Tiago. Midfielder Koke is also the subject of fevered interest but all interested parties are being referred to his buy-out clause of £48m.

Simeone wants to build on the success of last season but with his squad being dismantled to pay off debts he is concerned at what will be left.

Miranda turns 30 in September and has reached an impasse in talks over a new contract. Manchester City, United and Barcelona have all shown an interest although United insist they have not made any offer.

City have Eliaquim Mangala and Roma's Mehdi Benatia at the top of their wishlist and will open talks with Porto over a deal for Mangala after the World Cup despite his public declaration of love for Chelsea and also admitting he was partial to United.

Atletico meanwhile are considering Mateo Musacchio of Villarreal to replace Miranda should he eventually go.

It's no Shaw thing but United are still Luke-ing to Saints star

Manchester United remain determined to conclude a deal for Luke Shaw.

The final sign off has been delayed while Southampton search for a new manager. The south coast club are keen to get the optimum price should they sell their players after initially intimating that around £27m would be enough. They are also looking at options of players in return although may struggle to attract some as they continue to lose their own big names.

Arsenal remain keen on Morgan Schneiderlin and Calum Chambers and Liverpool will re-package a bid for Adam Lallana but will only go so far. Dejan Lovren, Dani Osvaldo, Victor Wanyama and Jay Rodriguez are also looking to leave.

Will Pape put pen to paper at Loftus Road?

Pape Souare is being considered by Queens Park Rangers as they weigh up potential recruits for left-back. The Senegal international who figured for his country at the Olympics currently plays for Lille in France. The 24-year-old has also had a spell on loan at Reims. Souare was linked with Arsenal earlier this season after their scouts watched several Lille games. Arsene Wenger was also asking for reports on Belgian starlet Divock Origi, 19, who plays up front at Lille.

Charley's got the Edge as he signs up to World Football agency

Everton youngster Charley Edge has signed up to Monaco-based agency World Football. The promising 17-year-old from Aberystwyth is a Wales U17 international and joined Everton at 14 after initially signing with Swansea then Stoke City.

He can play across the front line and has caught the eye with performances for the club's U18s. Quick, with a good left foot, Edge has drawn comparisons with a young Ryan Giggs in his style and lists Steven Pienaar as his favourite first team player at Goodison.
