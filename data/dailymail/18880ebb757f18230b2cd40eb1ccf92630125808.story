Richard Bristowe is facing jail after admitted to downloading thousands of images of boys being abused in the Philippines

A top flying instructor is facing jail after he admitted to downloading thousands of images of boys being abused in the Philippines.

Richard Bristowe was caught after he made international money transfers to a criminal in Manila who runs a live streaming service on the internet.

The 70-year-old is the director of Aviation South West, which runs a flying school at Exeter. 

Officers raided his Exeter home and his office at Exeter Airport in December 2012 and found 3,600 images or movies on his computers.

These included 41 in the worst category, which shows sadism or bestiality, and 275 showing adults raping children, of which 49 were movies.

He was also found with a memory stick in his pocket which contained the encryption key to many of the files which he had downloaded from the Philippines. 

Bristowe, from Exeter, has also run lessons from Plymouth Airport and is on the Civil Aviation Authority's heads of training group.

He has continued to sit alongside councillors and airline representatives on the Exeter Airport Consultative Group during the two years since his home was raided by police.

Bristowe has trained thousands of pilots and succeeded in keeping his secret life hidden until British police were tipped off about his Western Union payments to Manila. 

He admitted 12 counts of possessing indecent images of children at Exeter Crown Court.

Judge Phillip Wassall adjourned his sentence until next month and ordered the probation service to prepare a probation report.
