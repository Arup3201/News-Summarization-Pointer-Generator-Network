This groundbreaking footage signals the moment gamers around the world have been waiting for - the first action movie shot entirely from first person point-of-view cameras.

The gory preview of shoot-em-up film, Hardcore, will seem oddly familiar to anyone who has spent hours playing computer games such as the hugely popular Call of Duty. 

The film, which stars District 9 actor Sharlto Copley, has been 18 months in the making and now its creator is hoping to raise £160,000 to add the post-production special-effects needed for it to be cinema worthy.

Groundbreaking: Hardcore is the first full-lenth film to be shot in the first person point-of-view (POV)

Hardcore is also the first full-length movie to be shot using the Go Pro camera - a device that straps to the a helmet or other part of the body making it increasingly popular with extreme sports fans.

The film was created by Ilya Naishuller and was inspired by a similarly-shot short film he made for his band's music video - which earned more than 40 million views online.

Timur Bekmambetov, the director of Wanted and Night Watch, approached Mr Naishuller about making the full-length feature. 

Mr Naishuller initially dismissed the offer as 'gimmicky', but was soon convinced and now the pair are trying to raise £160,000 for post-production costs on the crowd fundraising site Indiegogo.

Dangerous: South African actor Sharlto Copley said the stunts performed in the film will leave you in disbelief

Mr Naishuller said: 'I came up with a concept which I believe could make a point-of-view film work well beyond its rather gimmicky roots.

'After a year and half of writing, shooting, shooting and more shooting we have finally wrapped production.

'The film is called Hardcore and I am proud to say that you have never seen anything like it. It's the first action film to be shot 100 per cent from the hero's perspective.

The movie tells the story of Henry - a cyborg who must rescue his wife and creator from a telekinetic tyrant by rescuing people and killing enemies by the dozen.

Set in Moscow, it takes place over the course of one day, with Copley's character Jimmy as Henry's only means of support.

The innovative approach means the audience effectively 'play' Henry - seeing everything unfold from his point of view. 

Mr Naishuller adds: 'We used mostly Go Pros and custom built rigs designed to stabilise the picture while keeping the action realistic and highly visceral.

'The film features a huge number of insane stunts but what makes it really special is that that every shot in the film comes from a stuntman wearing the camera rig.

'This leads to the ultimate experience where you, the audience, become one with the hero like you never have before. This had never been done before so there were no points of reference. 

'To fully realise my vision for Hardcore we need $250,000 - this money will go towards the great CGI team and the amazing sound designers that we need to hire.

The film's only well-known name is South African actor Sharlto Copley - who has recently starred in Elysium and Maleficent.

Appeal: Creator Ilya Naishuller is trying to raise £160,000 online to pay for post-production costs

Mr Naishuller said Hardcore provides the 'ultimate experience where you, the audience, become one with the hero like you never have before'

He said: 'It's a film I believe is truly groundbreaking. Hardcore has without a doubt been one of the most challenging and rewarding experiences that I've ever had making a movie.

'Ilya has literally pushed the boundary using this crazy team of Russian stuntman who have done some of the most incredibly dangerous stunts - all while wearing a Go Pro.

'I absolutely guarantee you have never seen anything like this before. Your support will mean you will get to experience Hardcore in the cinema in its full intended glory.'

Mr Naishuller's appeal has so far raised £90,000. To donate click here.
