Fresh sea bass from your local fishmonger, organic vegetables from the grocers and artisan bread from the village bakery is a foodie’s dream - but who has the time or energy to shop for that?

One new delivery service, which allows users to order food online from a range of local shops and have them delivered to their door in one lot, is hoping to make that concept a reality.

Hubbub - an Ocado-style delivery service for local shops - describes itself as a home delivery service on a mission to save the high-street.

So how does it work? Customers log in to their website and fill up their online basket with goods from participating shops in their local area and Hubbub drivers will collect your order from each shop and deliver it to your door at your chosen time.

That's handy! Hubbub is an Ocado-style delivery service for local shops that allows customers to buy food online and have it delivered to their door

The service costs £3.50 - the first order and any orders over £75 are, however, free.

Marisa Leaf, a former human rights lawyer, is the brains behind the business. She came up with the idea in 2007 after working such long hours that she was forced to live off convenience food.

She loved to eat well and had always been passionate about independent shops - but her lifestyle meant that, when it came to where she shopped and what she ate, she couldn’t make the choices she wanted to.

So in 2008, she spent £30,000 of her own money to pilot the concept.

Speaking to The Telegraph, she said: 'I kept thinking, if you could have the convenience of an online supermarket but with the quality and integrity of local shops, that would be perfect.’

Easy peasy: Shoppers log on, shop and then choose a delivery time suited to them, with the service costing £3.50

Hubbub was officially born in January 2010 and currently delivers 4,000 products from 32 independent shops across 200 postcodes of London.

Local shops such as Spice Mountain in Borough Market, Moxon’s fishmongers in south London and Giacobazzi's delicatessen in Hampstead are some of the businesses on board.

Hubbub promises that its items cost the same as they would in store and Leaf charges retailers around 50 per cent of their profit on the goods.

‘Today, Hubbub is a team of 13 food-loving shop-supporting superheroes including two former chefs, a food anthropologist, a development economist, an engineer, a wannabe pop-up restaurateur, two developers with massive brains, and our dashing delivery drivers,’ writes Leaf on her website.

Speaking about her customers, Leaf said they have a higher-than-average income, 'because by definition they are cash-rich and time-poor.’

‘I don’t agree with the common assumption that high street shops cost more than the supermarket. If you stand outside the Ginger Pig [a renowned London butcher] you will see people from all walks of life, because butchers sell cuts of meat that you don’t get in supermarkets,’ she said.

And Leaf is thinking big: she plans to take her foodie brainchild nationwide.
