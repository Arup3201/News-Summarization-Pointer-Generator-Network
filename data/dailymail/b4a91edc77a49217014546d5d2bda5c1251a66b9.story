Alexis Sanchez was back on familiar ground on Friday as the Chile national team trained at the Arsenal's London Colney base ahead of their match against Brazil at the Emirates on Sunday.

The 26-year-old was joined by his international team-mates as they were put through their paces in preparation for the all South American clash in north London.

The former Barcelona player appeared in high spirits as he was pictured waving - possibly to one of his Arsenal team-mates not involved in the international break - during the session on Friday.

Sanchez came off the bench at half-time but could do nothing to stop Chile suffering a surprise 2-0 defeat by Iran, who are managed by former Manchester United assistant Carlos Queiroz, in a friendly in Austria on Thursday night.

Goals either side of the break by Javad Nekounam and Vahid Amiri secured an impressive victory for Iran as Chile failed to win for the third time in their last five games.

Sanchez will be hoping his side can bounce back against their Latin American opponents in the glamour friendly on his home turf.

The Selecao got the better of Chile the last time the two sides met in the last 16 of the World Cup. Sanchez was on target as the game ended 1-1 before Brazil eventually won on penalties.
