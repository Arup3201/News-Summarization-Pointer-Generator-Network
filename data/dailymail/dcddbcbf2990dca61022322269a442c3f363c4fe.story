A high-risk convicted sex offender with a history of preying on children and the elderly who fled Canada for Seattle in 2013 has been arrested in connection to the rape of a 69-year-old woman.

Michael Stanley, 49, made headlines in October 2013 when he cut off an electronic-monitoring ankle bracelet and crossed the Canada-US border unchallenged. 

He's an American citizen, and US authorities said they had no reason to arrest him. Canada decided not to ask for his extradition, and he registered in Seattle as a Level 3 sex offender.

Vile crime: Stanley served 32 months for luring two mentally challenged boys into an apartment, lighting a crack pipe, blowing smoke in their faces and then sexually assaulting them 

Stanley, formerly of Edmonton, had a criminal record in Canada that dated back 25 years. 

Before he fled, he had most recently served 32 months for luring two mentally challenged boys into an apartment, lighting a crack pipe, blowing smoke in their faces and then sexually assaulting them. 

Stanley spent nine years in prison in the 1980s for the aggravated sexual assault of a wheelchair-bound 82-year-old woman in Lethbridge, Canada, reported CBC.ca.

The 49-year-old ex-convict also has a history of kidnapping children from playgrounds.  

Parole board documents also described a case in which Stanley broke into a 69-year-old woman's apartment while she was sleeping and sexually assaulted her.

The King County Sheriff's Office said he was arrested last Friday morning after entering the woman's home, in the Skyway neighborhood south of Seattle, through a window. No weapons were used, but the victim sustained what the sheriff's office described as minor injuries.

Prior to that, authorities said, Stanley had been meeting his requirements as registered sex offender, including checking in weekly as required and providing an accurate account of where he was staying each night.

Stanley, who is homeless, was being charged Monday and no court appearance was immediately scheduled, said Dan Donohoe, a spokesman for the King County Prosecutor's Office. He said prosecutors would request that bail be set at $1million.

Stanley ran into trouble soon after arriving in Seattle in fall 2013. He was arrested on misdemeanor charges of harassment and resisting arrest after he threatened someone who asked him to be quiet. He was sentenced to seven months in jail.
