A teenager who was smuggled into the UK from Afghanistan after the Taliban slaughtered his father and brother has won the right to remain in the UK.

Aspiring teacher Najibullah Hashimi, 19, said he owes a debt of gratitude to the British people who successfully backed his right to remain - including his adoptive family in Kent.

Mr Hashami, who made a six-month journey to the UK after fleeing his war-torn homeland as an 11-year-old in 2006, would have had to return to Afghanistan under Home Office regulations when he reached the age of 18.

Relief: Naj Hashimi was set to be deported back to Afghanistan, but his foster family and friends in Kent rallied to his cause

He secured 13 GCSEs and a handful of 
A-levels while living with a foster family in Kent, but was fearful that
he would be sent back to Kabul - a journey he said would result in his 
death at the hands of Taliban fighters.

But he has been told that the 
application to remove him has failed and - barring a final appeal from 
the Home Office - he will be granted a visa that will allow him to stay 
in the UK.

Speaking from his
foster family’s home in Faversham, Kent, he said: 'I am so grateful. 
Once I have the paperwork sorted I want to go to university to become a 
PE teacher.

'When I heard I won the case I was shouting and screaming, jumping all over the room. It was a relief.

'There isn’t the chance for education in Afghanistan for me. Here it is completely different.

'I honour this country, it has given me so much. I have learned something every day I have been to school.

'I want to be something in the future. I want to teach so I can give something back to this country.'

Mr Hashimi - who speaks four languages - was described as a 'son and 
brother' by his foster family, who covered
more than £1,600 in legal fees after an 11th-hour reprieve stalling his
flight to the Afghan capital prompted a series of tribunal hearings.

Integrated: Mr Hashimi said he wants to become a British citizen

He has not seen his mother since she begged him to seek safety in Europe.

The
Afghan said he first fled to Pakistan before walking for days and 
nights on end and hiding on-board freight transport destined for Dover.

He was eventually fostered by Steve and Michelle Griffiths, who already had two young sons, Tyler and Finlay.

Now
an active member of Rodmersham Cricket Club, the Muslim teenager said 
he feels fully immersed in Western culture and hopes to become a British
citizen.

He said; 'Living with Steve is like living with my real family. I love them and I love being with them.

'To be in this family is like feeling safe. It would be really hard for me (to go back to Afghanistan).

'I have already lost one family, I don’t want to lose a second one.'

Mr
Hashimi said he was terrified at the prospect of being sent on a plane 
to Kabul and left to fend completely for himself, and admitted he faced 
an anxious wait until the end of next week - the deadline for the Home 
Office to lodge an appeal.

But
he has been warmed by a petition of signatures backing his right to 
remain in the UK, collected while he was being held in an immigrant 
holding centre ahead of his intended removal.

'I don’t know who most of these people (who signed the petition) are,' he said.

'But
the public was behind me, so I just want to say a huge thank-you to 
them, otherwise I wouldn’t be here now, I’d be in Afghanistan.'

Mr
Griffiths said the decision by the Immigration and Asylum Chamber of 
the Upper Tribunal, sitting in London, was heavily weighted on the 
impact removing Mr Hashimi would have on his sons, aged nine and 11.

Retired firefighter and full-time foster parent Mr Griffiths, 43, added: “It’s been a very long process.

'I
think it’s been a bit of a witch-hunt against Najib because he has 
never done anything wrong since he has been in this country. He has 
worked so hard and taken every opportunity.

'When Najib was removed (to the holding centre), they just couldn’t understand it.

“There
are terrorists in this country who they (the Home Office) can’t deport,
then they are picking on a lad who wants to become a PE teacher and can
speak four languages and is going to be an asset to this country.

'I can’t understand why the Home Office keep going after him. It’s bizarre.”

He said the Home Office would have to find a point of law to be granted permission to appeal in the case.

'It’s been nearly three years of legal battles (starting before Mr Hashimi was an adult),' he said.

'We
haven’t always had legal aid and so have had to find some funding 
ourselves. But it has been amazing because even strangers have been 
handing over cheques to help because they believe Najib should stay.'

"To be in this family is like feeling safe... 'I have already lost one family, I don’t want to lose a second one."

Najibullah Hashimi, 19

Mick
Nokes, who met Mr Hashimi through his cricket club, said he had been 
inundated with people wanting to sign a petition calling for the Afghan 
national to be allowed to remain in the UK.

Thousands added their names to the document, while local MP Gordon Henderson also backed the campaign.

Mr
Nokes said: 'I first met Najib when he first came to England. He told 
me his story and I can remember he said he wanted a new life and put his
old life behind him.

'I was struck by how he came across, what a pleasant young man he was.

'He
has come to this country, worked hard, and has kept his religion and 
faith while fully embracing western culture. In many ways, he is just 
the sort of person we should fight to keep in our country.'

Tory
MP Mr Henderson echoed his pleasure at the ruling, and said: 'When so 
many undesirable people are allowed to remain in our country, I thought 
it was quite indefensible that Naj should be sent back to a country in 
which he has no relatives and no hope of a decent future.

'I
am confident that with the help of his adopted family and friends, Naj 
will become a hard-working member of our local community.'
