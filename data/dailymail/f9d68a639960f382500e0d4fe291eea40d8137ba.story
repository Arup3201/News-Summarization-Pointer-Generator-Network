Accused: Alwen Jones, 24, denies murder and manslaughter but says the victim 'deserved it'

A woman who stabbed a young mother to death claimed her victim ‘got what she deserved’.

Alwen Jones fatally attacked 31-year-old Emma Jones with a kitchen knife at a party in Penygroes near Caernarfon, North Wales last December.

The 24-year-old defendant later told police ‘what goes around comes around’, a jury heard today.

Alwen Jones denies murder and manslaughter of mother-of-one Emma, claiming in an earlier interview her actions were justified as ‘she stabbed a family member of mine a few weeks ago’. 

The incident took place at a party in a block of flats near Emma Jones‘ home attended by the defendant’s sister Grace and the victim.

According to witnesses Alwen Jones turned up outside the building screaming: ‘Come outside if you think you are hard enough Emma bach [little Emma]‘

Once Emma Jones responded and came to the front door, the defendant stabbed her in the chest.

Ian Murphy QC, prosecuting, said the victim did nothing to provoke the ‘violent outburst’ and was unable to defend herself.

Prosecution described how Alwen Jones had armed herself with a kitchen knife after a phone call from her 21-year-old sister Grace which involved Emma Jones.

Grace had called her boyfriend, who was at Alwen Jones’ home, in the early hours of December 10 and told him that Emma Jones and her partner had asked her to leave after a disagreement with another woman.

When the boyfriend informed Alwen 
Jones, of nearby Llanllyfni, about the exchange, she placed a kitchen 
knife down her top and made the ten minute walk to the party.

Later she told police that her ‘blood was boiling’ and that she was ‘mad’. 

After taunting Emma to come outside, Alwen Jones said she ‘flipped and went for her with 
the knife’, with Emma bleeding from a stab wound to the chest.

The defendant then threw the knife in a nearby front garden before 
making her way to her father’s home where she hid in a shed.

Fatally injured Emma Jones was taken to hospital in Bangor where she was pronounced dead.

The prosecution said Alwen Jones claims 
she brought the knife because she was afraid the victim was going to 
attack her, but then ‘lost control’.

Mr
Murphy said: ‘This is a case where the defendant armed herself with a 
knife and walked purposefully for ten minutes to the scene to find her 
sister safe from potential harm outside the building where Emma Jones 
was.

‘Thereafter, in what 
can only be anger and aggression, Alwen Jones conducted a verbal 
exchange with Emma Jones who as a result came downstairs to the front 
door.'

Mr Murphy added: 'In further anger and aggression, without warning, the defendant stabbed Emma Jones through the chest.

'The defendant didn't have a reasonable belief she needed to defend herself or her sister and she was throughout the aggressor.

'What we have in this case is a loss of temper and anger. This is clearly a tragic case with tragic consequences.’

Part-time worker Emma Jones had lived in the local area all her life and was a devoted mother to her 11-year-old autistic son.

The trial continues.
