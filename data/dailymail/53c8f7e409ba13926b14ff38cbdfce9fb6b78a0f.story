Sam Allardyce is achieving something at West Ham this season which eluded Andre Villas-Boas at Tottenham and, more recently, Brendan Rodgers at Liverpool.

How does a manager integrate so many new recruits - many from abroad, who do not speak the language well and have to adapt to the culture - into a side and get results immediately?

West Ham’s win against Manchester City on Saturday turned their surprise start to the season into a run with a bit more substance.

Take a look at the side which lined up at Upton Park in the league against City this time last year — which was demolished 3-1 - and Allardyce has gutted the squad.

There were eight changes to the starting XI on Saturday and five of those were summer signings.

It cost Villas-Boas his job at Spurs when he failed to get the most out of £100million worth of new players and Rodgers is now experiencing a similar difficulty at Anfield.

Sam Allardyce has done a good job working in the new players at West Ham into the existing squad 

But a key advantage Allardyce has over those men is his experience as a manager — 20 years, 13 of those in the Barclays Premier League.

Sakho is the second player in Premier League history to score in his first six starts in the competition, after Mick Quinn. 

‘Learning from the early days of the Premier League with Bolton, an influx of eight, nine, 10, 11 players, 75 to 80 per cent foreign, taught me one lesson particularly: don’t just think about the player, think about family,’ Allardyce explained. ‘How you integrate them into the culture. Provide all the needs for them to settle as quick as possible.

‘The player settles quicker, they come into the club environment and are accepted by the captain. But the outside, when they go home, is very important; girlfriend, wife, family, make sure they settle into the right area.

‘It’s hard to do, particularly if they don’t speak English well. I get a feel about a player when I speak to them. There are players I’ve spoken to and decided not to sign because of that last interview. Better doing it then than getting them here and having problems.’

Two summer signings, Diafra Sakho and Enner Valencia, are forging one of the most frightening strike partnerships in the league.

With a greater focus on attacking football this campaign, facing West Ham is a different prospect to last season.

This is reflected in the difference between Sam Allardyce’s starting XI from last season’s home defeat to Manchester City and Saturday’s win in the corresponding fixture - only three players started both games.

Sakho headed the winner against City, to score in his seventh consecutive game. Valencia, meanwhile, set up the first with a lightning run down the right to roll the ball to fellow recruit Morgan Amalfitano to tap in.

The show was run by Alex Song, on loan from Barcelona. Full back Aaron Cresswell, the fifth new player starting, crossed deep from the left for Sakho’s winner.

Allardyce added: ‘We give them the tools, then it’s down to them. If they are determined and have that much desire they take it up from there. Ours have this year.’

To help integration, the players take breakfast together every day at their Chadwell Heath training ground. Club captain Kevin Nolan and Mark Noble take the lead on helping the players adapt and a French-speaking physiotherapist helps with communication.

It is not one way, either. Amalfitano sat an English exam while flying to an away game recently.

‘It’s good they have come here and are making a real effort to speak our language,’ Noble said. ‘Whether it’s giving encouragement in training, or asking if they need anything, it’s about keeping them happy.’

Right now, everyone is happy at West Ham - even Jose Mourinho is learning to love them. ‘Jose has just text to say “Well done big man”,’ said Allardyce. ‘This shows how important it was for him, never mind us. The result wasn’t for him. It was for us and everyone at West Ham.’
