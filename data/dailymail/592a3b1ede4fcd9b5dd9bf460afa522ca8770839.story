A SKIER buried alive by an avalanche has revealed how he managed to survive - because he remembered to raise his arms a split-second before the snow engulfed him.

Philip Walsh, from Cheadle Hulme, Stockport, said his quick thinking meant rescuers were able to spot his hand sticking out above the snow.

They were able to dig an air tunnel to him just moments before his oxygen ran out.

Safety campaign: Philip Walsh wants skiers to be more aware of safety equipment such as helmets and shovels that can help in avalanches

Philip's pal Ryan Keene, 31, from London, died in the tragedy in the Canadian Rockies - along with Katie Aring, 30, from Ohio in the US.

Reliving his nightmare, Philip, 30, said: 'I was trying to hold on to the belief that I was going to get out, but as time went on I slowly started to panic. I was thinking: "This is it, this is how I'm going to die."

'I was trapped under the snow and I couldn't breathe at all. I was under for a few minutes, but it felt like hours.

'Everything just slowed down. Thankfully, people above the surface saw my hand and were able to get a tunnel of air down to me. When I was dug out it was complete hysteria.

'It was clear there were three people in much greater need than myself, receiving mouth-to-mouth and heart compression, and helicopters were coming in and out.'

Life cut short: Ryan Keene, of London, was killed in tragedy aged only 31

Philip had travelled to British Columbia with Ryan and three other friends to celebrate his 30th birthday.

He and Ryan were in a group of four skiers lead by an instructor waiting to be collected by helicopter after completing a run on Bonnington Mountain when the avalanche struck.

Philip, a sales manager for Lloyds TSB, said: 'The instructor pointed out an avalanche in the distance so we started moving towards higher ground.

'Seconds later, we realised how quickly it was coming and the instructor was shouting "come on guys, get moving, start moving".

'Before we knew it we were being catapulted in different directions. It was like being hit by a Ford Transit.

'I've been struggling to walk since I got back but it's absolutely nothing to what Ryan's family are going through. He loved an adventure and lived his life as we all should live it.'

Lucky: Philip feared death under snow

It is believed Philip was trapped for up to 20 minutes.

The events are being investigated by the British Columbian Coroners' Service.

Philip is now campaigning for skiers to be given avalanche training.

He said: 'Simple things like checking the weather conditions for the day, following safety instructions and taking transceivers and spades will save lives - but not enough people do this.

'It can be such a thin line between life and death. We received avalanche training beforehand when we were told to put our hands in the air and to keep our helmets on at all times and it saved my life.'
