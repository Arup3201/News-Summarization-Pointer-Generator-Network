A Tampa, Florida police captain exclaimed 'I can't believe what I've done' after fatally shooting a fellow moviegoer because he was texting, a witness said.

Alan Hamilton, a Sumter County cop, was inside the West Chapel screening of Lone Survivor and watched as 71-year-old police officer Curtis Reeves shot dead 43-year-old Chad Oulson.

He and other witnesses gave their account of events in Pasco County court today as Reeves asks to be released on bail. He has been in jail without bond ever since the January 13 shooting.

Release me: Curtis Reeves appeared in Pasco County Court today as he attempts to be released on bail after shooting dead a fellow moviegoer who was texting. Reeves teared up as his daughter acted as a character witness

Witness Mark Turner overheard the fight, and said he heard Oulson say: 'Do you mind, I've got a voicemail from by babysitter. I'd like to check to see that my daughter is okay.'

After more requests to stop using his phone, Oulson got up and threw a small bag of popcorn at Reeves, Turner said.

'Almost immediately the gun came out, the shot was fired and it went back into Mr. Reeves' lap,' Turner said.

Hamilton remembers Reeves yelling at his wife after the incident, after she said 'That was no cause to shoot anyone.'

'He leaned back around and stuck his finger out as to scold her and said, "You shut your [expletive] mouth and don't say another word,"' Hamilton testified.

Reeves officially plead not-guilty today to second-degree murder, with his defense lawyers arguing that Reeves was defending himself from Oulson, who committed battery by throwing an unknown object and a bag of popcorn at the older man.They also say Reeves is entitled to special legal protection because of his advanced age.

According to Hamilton's testimony, Reeves approached him after the shooting and said: 'I just got hit by something and look at my eye'.

But Hamilton says he didn't see any injury on Reeves' face.

Both Hamilton and Turner say they didn't see Oulson hit or punch Reeves.

These new perspectives on the fatal altercation came the same day that family and friends of Reeves acted as character witnesses for the accused murderer.

Thomas DePolis, who worked with Reeves to create a SWAT team for the Tampa Police department said: 'There's nothing in my affiliation with him that would lead me to believe that he's a danger.'

Reeves 40-eyar-old daughter Jennifer Shaw also testified on her father's behalf, describing him as a man who dedicated his time to his family and went to church every Sunday.

'My father was present at everything. My parents seemed to realize that investing time in your family was the most important thing,' Ms Shaw said.

She said all the weapons have been removed from the house she shares with her parents by her brother who is a Tampa police officer.

The family are willing to but their $186,0000 house as collateral for bond.

The judge didn't make a decision on whether to release Reeves today. His bail hearing will continue on Friday.

However, the judgeÂ  did decide that surveillance footage from the movie theater would be aired in court and released 30-days after.

It is not clear though whether that footage will be available to view by the general public.

Florida has some of the broadest public records laws in the nation.

Almost any document released to the defense in a court case can be open to the public.

However, they changed the law in 2011 to exempt photographs, video or audio recordings that depict or record the killing of a person.
