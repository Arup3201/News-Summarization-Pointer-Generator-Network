Tom Ince would have been made at Inter Milan.

His dad, Paul, was a Nerazzurri favourite in the mid Nineties. He and Ashley Cole would have been England’s sole flag-bearers in Serie A and there was also the lure of a wage packet bursting with Euros.

But Ince Jnr decided against following in his father’s stud marks and instead joined up with one of his old man’s former Manchester United team-mates, Steve Bruce, in a decidedly less romantic location – Hull.

Nevermind that: Tom Ince insists he is 'over the moon' at Hull despite the earlier interest from Inter Milan

Earlier days: Ince played for Blackpool, before joining Crystal Palace on loan, and is now with Hull City

It's not too late to play MailOnline Fantasy Football... There's £1,000 to be won EVERY WEEK by the highest-scoring manager!

The 22-year-old, however, is thrilled with his new surrounds, rejecting the Italian giants to swap the west coast of Blackpool for the east of Humberside.

‘I am over the moon,’ said Ince, who signed a two-year deal at the KC Stadium in July.

‘I have found my home. With the manager, when someone helps you out like that, not only on the pitch but off the pitch, you are happy.

‘When you are happy off the pitch the performances come on it. I know what I want to do, I’ve got ambitions in myself. But first of all it is to try and do well for Hull City.’

And what of turning down the offer from Inter?

‘I’ve said to many people, it’s easy to just reach for the stars and go for the top and think “Yeah, I’m doing this, I’m doing that”. But you have to think football,’ said the England Under-21 forward.

‘There are not many 20, 21, 22-year-olds that are playing week in, week out in the Premier League now.

‘I am with a great bunch of lads and there are a lot of games coming up, hopefully in the Europa League and in the cup runs as well, there is plenty of football to be played.’

Hull will have to overcome a 1-0 deficit to Sporting Lokeren this week if they are to extend their stay in the Europa League. Ince was a second-half substitute on Thursday as the Belgians nicked victory following a gift from goalkeeper Allan McGregor.

And he reflected: ‘It’s a learning curve. This is our first ever time in this tournament. These European teams, you have to learn, you have to adjust to it.

‘Throughout the game we looked the better side, we kept the ball. We had a 10-minute spell where we were a little bit shaky but we soon got back under control and started creating chances. There are lots of positives to take into next week and we will be ready to take them on at the KC.’

Inter Milan are one possible opponent should Hull progress to the group stage. The San Siro, then, could yet await Ince this season.
