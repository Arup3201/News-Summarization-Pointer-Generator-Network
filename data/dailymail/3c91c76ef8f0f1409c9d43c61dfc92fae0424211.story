A man charged with the murder of a woman was allegedly plotting to kill the President of the United States, it emerged yesterday.

Prosecutors revealed the ultimate ambition of James McVay yesterday as he appeared in court accused of killing Maybelle Schein, 75, as she slept.

The 41-year-old's horrific plot included a bid to kill several others, including policemen.

Mrs Schein's throat was slashed with a camping knife as she lay in her bed in Sioux Falls, South Dakota.

McVay is accused of taking her white Buick to Madison, where he allegedly planned to 'ambush and kill a police officer and take their guns'.

According to the charges,he told investigators "I'm going to kill and kill until I get him,' referring to the president.

The former South Dakota inmate planned to travel to Chicago or Indianapolis where he would kill again before stealing another vehicle to drive to Washington.

Once there, he allegedly told investigators he intended to shoot Obama with a rifle.

According to the complaint McVay told authorities he began developing his plan to kill the president two years ago while in a South Dakota prison.

Hours
 after leaving a community transition programme on June 30,he walked 
to a Wal-Mart, where he stole clothing and knives.

He later selected the nurse's house to break into and commit the crime 
because he saw a garage door slightly ajar and a vehicle in the garage, and he "was going to kill people whenever 
the opportunity arose".

there,'

back in South Dakota within days.
