The chef behind 'the world's greatest restaurant' has launched a pop-up version in Japan, with a tasting menu priced £440 - complete with a surprisingly delicious starter of still-twitching prawns... and ants.

Chef Rene Redzepi's two-Michelin-star restaurant in Copenhagen has been voted the best in the world several times and now he has taken his talent to Tokyo.

Noma Tokyo recently opened to great fanfare on the 37th floor of the Mandarin Oriental hotel in Japan's capital for just five weeks - with two sittings per day.

Chef Rene Redzepi has taken his talent to Japan, with his pop-up Noma Tokyo offering a 15-course tasting menu that starts with a starter of prawns and ants (pictured)

The three-hour and 15-course tasting menu costs 78,529 yen (£440) a head, including wine, taxes and service charge.

And due to its success, it is now staying open a further two weeks until Valentine's Day.

Perhaps this is thanks to the show-stopping starter, which critics have raved about - live jumbo shrimp served atop a platter of ice 'with a dozen or so tiny wild black ants'. 

Noma has used ants in dishes before, serving them with beef tartare at the Copenhagen restaurant, and diners in Japan are used to eating live seafood. 

Adam Pasick, writing for QZ, described the dish as 'jumbo shrimp, so recently killed that they are still twitching, served with about a dozen tiny black ants for seasoning.'

And writing in The Japan Times, reviewer Robbie Swinnerton said: 'They are superb, premium sashimi quality and so fresh they’re still dancing their final quivers. 

'But it is the seasoning — “flavors of the Nagano forest” the menu calls it — that defines this dish. 

'A dozen tiny wild black ants are carefully arranged on the shrimp, their little pinpricks of sharp acidity acting as a perfect accent for the sweet, pink flesh.' 

But it's not just the first course that proved a hit - as the reviewer adds that every dish 'is the product of intense, intricate preparation' and a 'radical combination of ingredients'.

He adds of the 'prettiest' dishes features slivers of simmered pumpkin paired with salted cherry blossoms' and even the tofu course is a 'revelation'.

Danish Chef Rene Redzepi, who won the title World's Best Restaurant with Noma two years in a row, has moved to Japan for a five week stint in Tokyo

Foodies across the planet have been raving about Noma for  years - with more than one dubbing it 'the world's best restaurant'.

The restaurant, which is based in Copenhagen, serves Nordic food reimagined under the watchful eye of head chef René Redzepi. 

Noma's website boasts it is 'hoping to rediscover our history and shape our future' through its food.

Diners are offered a 20-course menu, including unusual dishes such as beef tartare and ants, radish and yeast and reindeer moss and cep mushrooms. 

A meal at the two Michelin-starred restaurant costs around about £166, with wine pairing costing an extra £104.

But it is worth it, according to the restaurant critics.

Writing for the Daily Mail in 2010, Tom Parker Bowles concluded: 'Noma is utterly and gloriously unique. And quite, quite brilliant.' 

The Tokyo pop-up is the first time Redzepi and his team have ventured outside Denmark.

It opened last Friday, and so far reviews trickling out suggest it will be just as successful in the east.
