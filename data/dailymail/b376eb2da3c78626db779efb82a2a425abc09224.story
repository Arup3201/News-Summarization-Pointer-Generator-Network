Liverpool and Ivory Coast defender Kolo Toure has malaria, the country's football federation has announced.

The 33-year-old defender fell ill on a trip home to Abidjan before joining the team's World Cup training camp in Dallas, the team's doctor said.

Cyrille Dah told the Ivorian Football Federation website, www.fif-ci.com: 'Since Wednesday Kolo has been having treatment. This treatment will end on Friday. We have therefore told him to rest. He will not participate in the match against Bosnia-Herzegovina (on Saturday), but will return early next week.'
