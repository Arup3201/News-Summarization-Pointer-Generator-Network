The woman behind Siri, Apple's friendly voice-activated virtual 'assistant,' has finally been revealed.

Susan Bennett, a voice-over actor from suburban Atlanta, Georgia, laid down hours of nonsensical recordings for an unknown client eight years ago; little did she know, she would soon be speaking to more than 100million people once Siri was introduced with the iPhone 4S on October 4, 2011.

For four hours a day during the entire month of July
 2005, Mrs Bennett, 64, read hundreds of phrases and sentences that enabled Apple to pull out vowels, consonants, syllables and diphthongs; before playing with her pitch and speed.

'There are some people that just can 
read hour upon hour upon hour, and it's not a problem. For me, I get 
extremely bored ... So I just take breaks. That's one of the reasons why
 Siri might sometimes sound like she has a bit of an attitude,' Mrs Bennett told CNN. 'Those sounds might have been recorded the last 15 
minutes of those four hours.'

While Apple won't confirm that Mrs Bennett is Siri, professionals who know her voice, including those who represents her legally, say she is Siri. An audio-forensics expert with 30 years of experience also studied both voices and confirms that she is '100per cent' Siri.

Mrs Bennett revealed her identity during an interview with CNN that was unrelated to Siri or Apple, something she says she didn't take lightly.

When ScanSoft, a software company looking for a voice for a new project, asked Mrs Bennett to record phrases to be used in a database to construct speech, she had no idea how her voice would eventually be used

'I really had to weigh the importance of
 it for me personally. I wasn't sure that I wanted that notoriety, and I
 also wasn't sure where I stood legally,' she admitted.

'And so, consequently, I was 
very conservative about it for a long time. And then this 
Verge video came out ... And it seemed like everyone was clamoring to 
find out who the real voice behind Siri is, and so I thought, well, you 
know, what the heck? This is the time.'

Mrs Bennett fell into voice work by 
accident in the Seventies. Today, she speaks in commercials and on 
countless phone systems. She also spells out directions from GPS 
devices, and greets travelers in Delta airport terminals.

But in 2005, when ScanSoft, a 
software company looking for a voice for a new project, asked Mrs 
Bennett to sign a contract offering her voice for recordings that would 
be used in a database to construct speech, she had no idea how her voice
 would eventually be used.

When Apple released its iPhone 4S, the first to feature Siri, Mrs Bennett was alerted to her familiar voice by friends and family.

'A colleague e-mailed me [about Siri] and said, "Hey, we've been playing around with this new Apple phone. Isn't this you?"' So Mrs Bennett pulled up Apple's website and listened to video clips announcing Siri. 'It's obviously me. It's my voice,' she said.

When her son, Cameron Bennett, a 
photographer in Los Angeles, saw an iPhone 4S commercial on television, he said he was flummoxed seeing director Martin Scorsese talking to his mother.

Then when Cameron
 bought the phone himself, she began guiding him on its GPS 
feature. 'Her voice has been everywhere 
throughout my life. I'd call my bank while I was in college in Colorado,
 and it was my mom telling me I had $4,' he said.

So why won't Apple confirm Mrs Bennett as Siri's voice? Marcus Graham, CEO of GM Voices, which represents Mrs Bennett, says that 'companies are competing to create the best-sounding and functioning systems.

When her son, Cameron Bennett, a photographer in Los Angeles, saw an iPhone 4S commercial on television, he said he was flummoxed seeing director Martin Scorsese talking to his mother.

'Their concern is driving revenues. Talking about the voice talent, from their perspective, is likely seen as a distraction.'

Mrs Bennett's attorney, Steve Sidman, said that since he began representing her last year, he has 'engaged in substantial negotiations -- multiple, months-long negotiations -- with parties along the economic food chain, so to speak, that involved her rendering services as the voice of Siri.'

And then there's Graham, of GM Voices, a man who has built a career around providing voice over talent for interactive voice technologies.

Ed Primeau, a member of the American Board of Recorded Evidence from Michigan who has analyzed 'hundreds, if not thousands' of recordings in court hearings, said he spent four hours studying Siri and Mrs Bennett's voice.

'They are identical -- a 100per cent match, he said after creating back-to-back comparison files. And after asking a second opinion, for the 'importance of accuracy,' he said: 'Rest assured: It's 100% Susan.'
