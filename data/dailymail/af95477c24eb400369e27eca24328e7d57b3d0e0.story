Team news

Manchester City 

Manchester City playmaker Samir Nasri faces three to four weeks on the sidelines after suffering a calf injury in training this week.

The problem will rule the Frenchman out of Sunday's Barclays Premier League clash with his former club Arsenal at the Etihad Stadium.

Midfielder Yaya Toure is on international duty at the African Nations Cup but manager Manuel Pellegrini has declared all other players fit and in contention, including captain Vincent Kompany and strikers Sergio Aguero and Edin Dzeko.

Provisional squad: Hart, Caballero, Zabaleta, Sagna, Demichelis, Kompany, Mangala, Boyata, Clichy, Kolarov, Milner, Silva, Navas, Sinclair, Fernando, Fernandinho, Lampard, Aguero, Jovetic, Dzeko.

Arsenal defender Kieran Gibbs is likely to return for the Gunners' visit to reigning Barclays Premier League champions Manchester City on Sunday.

Gibbs has been suffering with a heel problem but is expected to be passed fit, while Theo Walcott and Mesut Ozil are also in contention after coming off the bench against Stoke last Sunday.

Danny Welbeck (thigh), Jack Wilshere (ankle), Mathieu Debuchy (shoulder), Mikel Arterta (ankle) and Abou Diaby (calf) are all ruled out.

 Key match stats (supplied by Opta)

The last seven Barclays Premier League games between Manchester City and Arsenal at the Etihad Stadium have seen 28 goals scored.

Alexis Sanchez has been involved in more goals (19 – 12 goals and seven assists) than any other player in the Premier League this season.

There have been six red cards in the last nine Premier League matches between these two sides.

Arsenal’s away form this season is patchy with four wins, four defeats and three draws in their 11 Premier League road trips.

In contrast, City’s home form under Manuel Pellegrini has been impressive with 25 wins from 29 Premier League games under his stewardship at the Etihad Stadium (W25 D2 L2).

Arsenal are the only team to score three goals at the Etihad in a Premier League game during Manuel Pellegrini’s reign – but this was in a 3-6 defeat.

Only Chelsea (11) have won more Premier League games away at Manchester City than Arsenal (10).

Manchester City are unbeaten in their last 12 Premier League matches (W9 D3 L0).

Only West Ham (14) have scored more headed goals than the Gunners this season (8).

Manchester City have conceded at least two goals in each of their last two Premier League home games. They haven’t shipped two or more goals in three consecutive home Premier League games since October 2002.
