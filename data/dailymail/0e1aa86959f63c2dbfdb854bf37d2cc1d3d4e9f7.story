In part two of extracts of Zlatan Ibrahimovic's explosive autobiography I am Zlatan Ibrahimovic, the striker tells of fist fights with team-mates and trying to evade the law in fast cars.

I joined AC Milan in 2010 and our biggest league match was approaching. The Milan derby against Inter, whose most passionate fans — the Ultras — were going to hate me. 

On top of that, I had issues with Oguchi Onyewu, a guy in my team. He was an American the size of a house, and I told a mate in the squad: ‘Something serious is gonna happen. I just feel it.’

Onyewu resembled a heavyweight boxer. He was nearly 6ft 5in and weighed over 15 stone, but he couldn’t handle me. He accused me of trash talking, but that wasn’t true. People trash talk me. I’ve heard so much s**t over the years: ‘F****** gypsy’, stuff about my mum — all that stuff. I retaliate with my body, not with words.

I told Onyewu I did not trash talk, but he just kept on. He shushed me with his finger. Then he did it again. I saw red. I didn’t say anything, not a word. That b****** was going to find out how I trash-talk!

The next time he got the ball in training, I rushed towards him and jumped up with my feet and studs out in front — the worst type of tackle. But he saw me and leapt out of the way. As we both crashed to the ground, my first thought was: ‘S**t! I’ve missed!’ As I got up and walked away I felt a blow to my shoulder. Not a good idea, Oguchi Onyewu.

I headbutted him, and we flew at each other. We wanted to tear each other limb from limb. It was brutal. We were rolling around, punching and kneeing each other. We were crazy and furious — it was like life and death. 

Afterwards, the weirdest thing happened. Onyewu started praying to God with tears in his eyes, making the sign of the cross. This felt like a provocation, and I got more furious.

I was stopped by my team-mates, and I suppose that was a good thing. It could have turned out nasty.

All the time, I was thinking: ‘S***, my chest hurts,’ so we had it checked out. I’d broken a rib in the fight.

It was not the first time I’d had a dispute with a team-mate.

It's not just his own team-mates he gets involved with: The striker gets involved in a scrap between Inter Milan and Valencia in 2007

Seeing red: Paris Saint-Germain's star striker is sent off against Valencia earlier this year

In 2004, I was playing for Sweden 
against Holland, whose team included many of my Ajax club colleagues. It
 was a friendly but the entire Sweden squad was out for revenge for our 
loss in the Euro 2004 tournament. We wanted to prove we could beat 
Holland. 

Early on in the 
match I got a ball outside the penalty area and immediately had four 
Dutchmen on me. One of them was my team-mate, Rafael van der Vaart, who 
went on to play for Tottenham. I powered my way through the challenges, 
and Van der Vaart was left lying in pain on the pitch.

He was taken off on a stretcher with a torn ankle ligament. Nothing serious, but he might miss a match or two. 

He
 claimed in the papers that I’d injured him on purpose. What kind of 
**** was that? There wasn’t even a free-kick awarded! That guy was 
supposed to be my team captain! I phoned Van der Vaart: ‘Listen up, I’m 
sorry, it’s a shame about your injury, but it wasn’t intentional. You 
got that?’ 

He didn’t back 
down even a millimetre. When we returned to Ajax, the atmosphere became 
more and more heated. Finally, Ronald Koeman, the coach, called us into a
 meeting. By that time I was completely obsessed. 

We
 all sat in a circle in our lunch room, and I immediately sensed the 
seriousness of the situation. You could feel it in the air.

‘Zlatan did it on purpose,’ said Van der Vaart, and I saw red. ‘I
 didn’t injure you on purpose, and you know that. If you accuse me again
 I’ll break both your legs, and that time it will be on purpose,’ I 
said.

'Cowardly': Chiellini tried to provoke Ibrahimovic with a tackle from behind, says the striker

Grappling: Ibrahimovic and Chiellini have had plenty more on-field battles since

While at Ajax, my
 friend Mido, who went on to play in the Premier League, declared 
publicly that he wanted to be transferred. He wasn’t exactly a diplomat;
 he was worse than me. After one match, when he’d been on the bench 
against Eindhoven, he came into the locker room and called us all 
miserable c****.

I 
responded by saying if anybody was a c*** it was him. Mido picked up a 
pair of scissors and flung them at me. It was completely nuts. The 
scissors whizzed past my head, straight into the concrete wall and made a
 crack in it. 

I went over 
and gave him a smack, but 10 minutes later we left with our arms around 
each other. Much later I discovered our team manager had kept those 
scissors as a souvenir, to show his kids.It wasn’t all about fighting with team-mates.

I
 remember facing Giorgio Chiellini, a centre back who is now the 
vice-captain of Italy. We had played at Juventus and he tried to provoke
 me with a cowardly tackle from behind. 

I
 went down in a lot of pain but didn’t say anything. I took my revenge 
after the final whistle, grabbing his head and dragging him along like a
 disobedient dog. I could see Chiellini was scared.  ‘You wanted to 
fight. So how come you’re s******g yourself now,’ I hissed before 
heading off to the changing room.

I love cars, but sometimes I drive like a maniac. Me and a friend took a new Porsche Turbo out on the roads in Sweden.

I stepped on the gas and got it up to 155mph. When I slowed down, we heard police sirens.I couldn’t just stop, apologise and hand over my licence.

The police boxed in about four cars behind us. I had Dutch number plates, which they couldn’t trace, so I floored it and hit 190mph. The 'wee, wee' of the sirens became fainter and fainter. It was like a film as we nipped into an underpass and waited until the police had disappeared. 

Another time, we weren’t so lucky. I drove with a friend along the street where all the prostitutes in Malmo wait for punters. We saw a woman leaning over a car, talking to a client, and decided to have some fun. 

I slammed on the brakes and rushed over yelling: ‘Police. Put your hands up!’ The old man was totally scared and tore out of there. Minutes later, he turned up in a police car.

‘It was a joke,’ I explained. The cops laughed, but a photographer appeared  and snapped a photo. Idiot that I was, I put on a huge grin. You can imagine what happened next.
