A puppy pit-bull in Florida has suffered a tragic end after a vicious alligator grabbed it from the shores of a lake and took the dog underwater â€” all while his shocked owner watched.

Eric Glover, of Orlando, says the attack happened while he was playing fetch Monday with his 10-month-old King along the shores of a lake at Eagles Nest Park.

'My boy, he turned around, came to me, and he took off to run back again,' Glover told WKMG.

'And when he took off again, the gator came out, snatched him in front of the bank here and took him in. And that was it.'

Glover told authorities the alligator appeared to be as long as 11 feet.

The attack was so quick, Glover didn't have time to do anything about it.

The 55-pound pit-bull didn't even make a sound, the man said.

'I don't even think he knew he was hit,' Glover told WFTV about his pup. 'It was like that quick.'

Trappers with Florida Fish and Wildlife on Monday scoured the lake for hours in search of the alligator, WFTV reported.

They left empty handed after sunset.

'I couldn't do nothing,' Glover told WFTV. 'I froze, and I am like, "Oh, my God. That is a gator." Like, my instincts, "That is a gator eating my dog." I was shocked.'

At least one neighbor said he'd seen a big alligator lurking about recently.

'I hear people say it's more than one,' Chris Bradley told the Orlando Sentinel. 'They took an alligator out of a smaller pond nearby.'

Some
 12 people were bitten by alligators in Florida, according to the 
Sentinel. None of the attacks was fatal, although at least seven bites 
resulted in major injuries.

Dog owner Eric Glover said he was 'shocked' and didn't have time to react when the 11-foot alligator snatched his 10-month-old pit-bull, King
