Barclays has launched a mobile shopping service that lets customers buy products simply by scanning them with their smartphones.

The feature has been added to the bank’s payment app, Pingit, and has been designed to make mobile purchases 'quicker and easier'.

Shoppers who spot goods in a window 
display can scan a quick response, QR, code using their
phones to see the price, delivery information and stock levels, as well as get the option to buy the item with one click.

Barclays new 'buy it' feature has been added to the bank's payment app, Pingit. Shoppers can scan a quick response, QR, code attached to a product in a shop window to see the price, delivery information and stock levels, as well as get the option to buy the item with one click

QR, or Quick Response, codes are a type of barcode that can be read using smartphones.

A traditional barcode is a made up of vertical lines, whereas QR Codes can be scanned vertically or horizontally.

A standard code, also known as UPC/EAN can store up to 30 numbers.

A QR code can store more than 7,000. 

The data stored can link to text, emails, websites, adverts and shopping checkouts, for example.

Barclays claims its 'buy it' service 
'bridges the gap between advertising and sales' by letting consumers
buy goods and services immediately.

The new feature has been launched with a 'mobile checkout' tool to enable shoppers to pay for other items using an app or a mobile website.

Rather than input payment and delivery details into a site's own checkout, customers can select to pay for the item using Pingit.

This means all their payment details are added automatically and they can complete a purchase with 'only a few clicks'.

'For mobile-enabled businesses, this is a great way to increase sales conversion by reducing payment input errors and increased consumer assurance at checkout,' Mike Walters, head of UK corporate payments at Barclays, said.

'It converts every bit of hard media 
the corporate has and can advertise on, whether that is posters, flyers,
leaflets, or even a TV screen or web page, into a sales channel.'

The Pingit app is available on Google's Play Store and Apple's App Store.

It launched in February 2012 and lets people send up to £300 
by entering the recipient’s mobile phone number - removing the need to 
know sort codes and account numbers.

Pingit transfers money instantly, letting the recipient withdraw it from a cash machine straight away.

The
system was developed by Barclays, but NatWest and RBS customers can also use a similar service from their bank accounts.

In order to send money, customers must have a smartphone, download the Pingit app and enter their account details with a five-digit PIN.

People who receive a Pingit transfer don't need a smartphone but must be registered for the service.

Elsewhere, PayPal recently unveiled PayPal Beacon which makes it possible for shop owners to automatically recognise customers as they walk into the store using a signal sent from their phone.

Rob Skinner from PayPal said: 'The great advantage of using PayPal has always been that you don’t have to enter your credit cards details when making a payment, and our customers love this benefit even more on a smartphone!

'We’re always striving to create everyday solutions that solve existing problems, whether it’s the frustration of having to enter your credit card number over and over again at check-out, or the inconvenience of splitting a bill with friends after dinner.

PayPal has a solution to make things easier and faster.'
