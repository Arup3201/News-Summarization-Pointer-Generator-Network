The party’s over, and for the 10,000 Democrat disciples who frolicked into the wee small hours at Barack Obama’s re-election shindig in his hometown of Chicago, it’s time to call it a day.

Yet as the grassroots campaigners began wending their way back to all corners of America, still clutching the flags they had waved till their arms went numb, the mood among them was far from euphoric.

Rather, there was a sense of sheer relief.

Relief that Romney’s worrying late surge had been repelled; relief that poll predictions of a Republican upset had proved ill-founded; and relief that the bitter, protracted struggle to spare their Messiah the ignominy of a one-term presidency was finally over.

How very different it was, this muted Second Coming, from that November night four years ago, when I stood among 250,000 Americans of every colour, creed and age to watch the nation’s first black president take his place in history.

Then, Obama’s nebulous promises of ‘hope and change’ were alone enough to kindle a great outpouring of joy and goodwill that bridged all divisions, but this time round the spontaneity was gone, and the celebrations seemed too triumphal, given the parlous state of the nation; and too schmaltzy and slickly choreographed.

For those millions who watched it all on TV, I am told, the victory rally at the McCormick Center – a vast, soulless and windowless steel-and-glass exhibition hall built for trade fairs – looked impressive enough.

The left-leaning stars turned out for Obama as usual (a veritable array including Stevie Wonder and the ubiquitous will.i.am); the backdrop of shimmering, red and blue satin curtains was suitably dramatic, and the jukebox selections – from Michael Jackson’s I Want You Back to Neil Sedaka’s Oh What a Night – were a thematic masterstroke.

Behind the scenes, however, rather like the US economy, it was all rather shambolic.

Only the A-listers had seats; the hoi-poloi were forced to stand for hours without refreshments on a bare linoleum floor as they waited for the so-called people’s president to address them.

The acoustics were so awful that you could barely make out what Obama was saying at the back of the hall, and with the world’s press trying to relay their stories, the internet – a tool the Democrats have used to devastating effect – went on the blink.

‘How can he hope to fix the economy when he can’t fix the freaking wi-fi,’ quipped one frustrated American reporter standing near me.

How indeed? Since there wasn’t any sound to accompany the news bulletins flickering on six giant screens either, it meant that people watching the night unfold from their armchair had a far better idea what was going on than those of us corralled in the darkened hall.

Below us, the Democratic Party throngs were similarly unenlightened, some nervously failing to grasp that – though the electoral college vote showed Romney ahead until 10pm [3am British time] – the projected results meant an Obama victory was then all but assured.

History will record that the result was first declared by MSNBC.

By my watch it was 10.15pm, [3.15am in Britain] and the hall erupted. ‘Four more years! Four more years!’ the crowd chanted, whooping and waving their little flags.

For them it was a cry of deliverance, but for almost half of this divided nation it must have sounded as though they were handing down a sentence.

Obama, who was so unsure of the outcome that he had prepared two speeches, one for victory, the other for defeat, expressed his relief – and thanks – by way of a Twitter message. ‘Great headline,’ someone behind me chimed. ‘Victory is tweet!’

Another reporter preferred the more caustic: ‘Obama Bailed Out.’

Romney conceded at 11.52pm [4.52am in Britain], and a few minutes later he was making his concession speech, the graciousness of which contrasted sharply with the mocking catcalls and whistles from Obama’s watching supporters.

For some unfathomable reason, they were made to suffer for a further 44 minutes – like fans at a rock concert awaiting the top-billing act – before the Messiah and his family finally took to the stage.

Four years ago, he had promised to bring a new spirit of unity to America. It was a measure of his failure to achieve that pledge that his tone was conciliatory, almost chastened.

He spoke of ‘ending the gridlock’, ‘building consensus’ and making ‘difficult compromises’.

His speech, though sprinkled with the usual patriotic and sentimental homilies, was measured and cautionary: worlds apart from the ‘Change Has Come’ mantra that electrified us on that warm night in Grant Park.

Four years ago, as I walked back to my hotel, awe-stricken, I gladly accepted the hugs of strangers and even stopped to purchase an Obama T-shirt from a street hawker.

Yesterday the souvenirs were on offer again – trademarked and only available from official vendors (‘pet apparel’ was going for $10, and golf accessories cost $5).

This time my wallet stayed firmly in my pocket.

Yet though Obama has proved to be all too mortal, we shouldn’t forget how far he has come – nor how his narrative has inspired millions of less fortunate Americans, not least the black children of Chicago’s appallingly blighted South Side, a few miles from the scene of his latest triumph.

For them, he remains a symbol of the dreams that can still be achieved in this great but troubled country.

Tomorrow he must strive anew to live up them.
