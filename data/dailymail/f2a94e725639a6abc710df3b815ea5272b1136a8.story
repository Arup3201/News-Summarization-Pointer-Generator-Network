A father sick of his teenage son's battered car has put the 'dustbin' motor on eBay, listing all the things wrong with it - and frankly asking, 'Who would buy it?'

Nigel Stewart-Stone uses the advert to apologise for the state of the black Renault Clio, which he says is full of litter and boasts multiple dents thanks to his son Dalton's bad driving.

Among the many faults with the vehicle are a passenger seat which doesn't move because girls are always getting in and out, according to the jokey eBay listing.

Battered: Nigel Stewart-Stone is selling his son Dalton's old Renault Clio in a brutally frank eBay advert

Damage: The car is badly dented because of its teenage owner's erratic driving, according to his father

Mr Stewart-Stone, 50, suggests that the car would be best for another teenager - because Dalton's trashing of the vehicle 'will save them all the time and effort'.

Other problems with the 10-year-old Renault include a slipping clutch, which its owner failed to notice because he's always blasting loud music, his father said.

The mischievous father, from Newton Abbot in Devon, is selling the car because Dalton, 19, has a new one - but Mr Stewart-Stone says the replacement vehicle 'will be coming up for sale in a similar state in some years to come'.

He signs himself off as a 'devoted father with much patience', and admits the car has 'absolutely no warranty'.

But despite the brutally honest advert, the online auction for the car - which has done 130,000 miles and would normally fetch £1,500 in good condition - has already reached £117, with another five days left to run.

Defensive: Dalton, pictured with his new Vauxhall Corsa, says he is 'quite a clean person'

Mr Stewart-Stone said: 'I wrote the advert after my son's car packed up and he had a bit of a panic.

'He's an estate agent so needed something nice to go to work in. I sat down and looked at the car and thought, who is really going to buy it anyway?

'Then I started grinning to myself about the things that he had done to the car. It's just typical of a teenager. When we bought it there was nothing wrong with it.

'I have had so many text messages and emails through eBay and on Facebook. Some of the responses have been really great. I find it really amusing.

'I don't think my son expected so many people to read it. He might actually start to get a little bit embarrassed.'

Knackered: A handle has come off one of the car's doors, and the upholstering has a tear in it

But Dalton said: 'I'm not really embarrassed at all as my dad cracks jokes all the time. He thinks he's really funny.

'I hadn't even sat down from work when he started reeling the advert off to me. I think he's been quite pleased with the attention - he put his best clothes on for the photo.

'There are certain ground rules with my new car. I'm not allowed food or McDonald's. No smoking and no girls except my girlfriend. He's a joker really because I'm quite a clean person.'

Even eBay users with no interest in buying the car expressed appreciation for the humorous tone of the listing.

Jon Zaple, 25, wrote: 'Thanks for entertaining me and my friends for five minutes whilst we read your eBay article.

'I'd like to take this opportunity to wish you the utmost luck in selling your son's car. We actually considering buying it for a laugh at one point.'

This car belonged to my 19-year-old son, who now has a new car, I can only apologise for the state of it, clearly he will treat his new one the same.

OK, the passenger side has a large dent on it, were my son tried to climb the corner of my house, I did tell him that if he is going to insist on going back and forth on the wall the dent will get bigger!!! And the driveway is only 10ft wide after all.

The clutch is now slipping, again he did not know this, as loud music is the preferred thing, and could not hear it slipping, just wondered why it took him longer to get up a hill!!! Still there is enough clutch left to get you home, I think?

Surprisingly the electric windows still work well, considering the amount of times they go up and down calling to his mates, and banter with the passing girls, many of whom have been taken for rides in the car, which may explain the passenger seat not moving back and forth anymore, still makes it hard for them to escape his deafening music.

Honest: This advert lists all the flaws of the car, which dates back to 2005 and has done 130,000 miles

There may or may not be any oil and water in the car, despite me repeatedly telling him to make sure it was maintained, I believe he thought this meant sitting in it on the driveway listening to his music whilst having a smoke, he would have washed it occasionally, but said 'not really worth it now is it dad', as it's got a big dent on it!!! And anyway, surely I would know if it needed oil, the red light would come on!! Still he does have a brand new set of mats in the boot, bought when he first had the car.

There may be the odd ripple in the front of the bonnet, but according to my son that was there when it was bought for him, and nothing to do with sitting and chilling on it, may be it was a better place to sit than the passenger seat!!

It does have the other alloy wheel in the boot, with a puncture, but if he gets another puncture he will use one of the other three on the car.

The drivers seat has a hole in it, this was done killing time, whilst stuck on the side of the house performing modifications to the side of the car.

The rear of the car is in fact a large dustbin for discarded fruit, and Mc Donald's, not for carrying passengers, but still he says he's loving it!!!

Anyway if you think this car may be suitable for your son, please go ahead and buy it, it's after all in the perfect state for any teenager lad, and will save them all the time and effort that my son has put in to it, getting it this way.

It's now down to me to dispose of this wonderful car I bought him many years ago, now he has a new one, he thinks that you just leave it parked on the side of the road until someone comes and takes it.

It's not how he has treated the car since he has owned it that worries me, its the fact that he now has a new 14 plate car, which incidentally will be coming up for sale in a similar state in some years to come, although he informs me he will look after this one because it has 'no dents', and is clean and shiny, and doesn't need washing, to my surprise he went and bought a new set of mats for it - 'They're in the boot', is this history repeating itself?

When I told my son I was selling it, because he now had a new car, he said well who gets the money? I said me of course, but it won't be much as the car has had it, to which he then replied,'That's not fair, it's a good car, nothing wrong with it,' and that he should get the cash.

I offer absolutely no warranty with this car, and many thanks for looking.

Nigel, a devoted father with much patience.
