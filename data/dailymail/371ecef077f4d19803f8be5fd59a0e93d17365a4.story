An idiotic driver has been banned for 18 months after he was caught on camera performing stunts in a car park with friends clinging to his moving vehicle.

Samuel Lee Cooper, 25, of Harrogate, North Yorkshire, was also ordered to take an extended driving test after CCTV operators saw him driving around the Asda car park in Bower Road.

The night-time footage, released today by police, shows two people sitting on the roof and another on the bonnet.

Meanwhile, a fourth prankster is seen running towards the moving car before sitting in the boot.

During the dangerous ride, the vehicle also passes over at least one speed bump.

The incident took place in July, and Cooper pleaded guilty to dangerous driving and driving with no insurance before Harrogate Magistrates’ Court on September 23. 

The car park at the superstore appeared to be otherwise deserted at the time, just after 10.25pm on July 16 - its opening hours on that day being 7am to 10pm. 

A police statement read: 'Cooper, aged 25, pleaded guilty to dangerous driving and driving with no insurance when he appeared at Harrogate Magistrates’ Court on September 23, 2014.'
