West Ham manager Sam Allardyce will leave it until the last possible minute before making a decision on Diafra Sakho’s fitness for the clash against Stoke.

The forward, who has scored seven goals in as many starts for the Hammers since his arrival from Metz, is struggling with a shoulder injury.

Allardyce is desperate for the Senegal international to be fit for the weekend - and wants to give Sakho every chance to prove his fitness.

‘We will wait, he is still in pain. There is no dislocation so it’s about his pain threshold.

‘It’s 50-50 at the moment - but we’ve still got 48 hours recovery time. And we might even wait until Saturday morning.’
