He admitted yesterday that he 'embarrassed' the council after being caught on video smoking crack cocaine.

But just hours after his emotional speech, Toronto Mayor Rob Ford swaggered and danced in the centre of the council chamber and sang along to One Love.

And this isn't the first time.

The scandal-hit Mayor was filmed swaying his hips, and soulfully pounding on his heart while listening to the same song in the chamber last December.

At yesterday's meeting, he said: 'I know I put this council through some challenges.

'I know I embarrassed council and I want to thank, sincerely, the deputy mayor for taking the reins.

'I can't thank you enough for taking the job on. The past is the past and we have to move forward so thank you. I sincerely, sincerely appreciate what you've done.'

In November last year Ford admitted to smoking crack cocaine 'probably in one of my drunken stupors' but said he had hidden his drug and alcohol problems.

The scandal-hit mayor was coaxed from his seat by a performer singing Bob Marley in the council 

It didn't take much and he quickly leap to his feet and joined in, swinging his hips along with the music

Just hours before, he had admitted to 'embarrassing' the council, but this didn't seem to faze him 

This followed six months of accusations and low approval ratings during which the embattled mayor repeatedly refused to step down.

He is now in second place for the upcoming re-election, down by just three percentage points in the latest poll.

Toronto residents seem to be warming up to him again, as 63 per cent wanted him to resign in June but now just half of the populations wants him to step down.

Councillor Joe Mihevc said he thought Ford's words were genuine 'for that moment.'

'I think the issue is whether that pattern of  behaviour will continue if he were to get re-elected and I've seen no reason why it won't continue,' Mihevc said.

Below is a video from the first time that the Mayor was filmed dancing to Bob Marley during a council meeting in December last year.
