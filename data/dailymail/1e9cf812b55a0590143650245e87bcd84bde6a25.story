Summer holidays are turning into a costly experience for cash-strapped Britons, thanks to a host of 'rip-off' charges once they arrive at their destination.

People feel they are being overcharged on everything from using their mobile phones, to using cash machines and even hiring sun-loungers, according to a survey.

When asked if data roaming charges were too high on their mobile phones, 60 per cent named this as one of the top five rip-offs people are landed with when on holiday.

When in roam: People have complained about the high cost of using their mobile phones abroad

This is despite the European Parliament voting through a cap on mobile phone charges.

From last month, the cost of making a mobile call from another European 
Union country fell from 30p a minute to 24p, while a text dropped to 
just 7p from 10p.

Mobile firms also had to cap internet charges for the first time, at 58p per megabyte for customers on 'data roaming'.

More than a quarter felt they were over-charged for hiring sun-loungers at beaches or around hotel pools, while 28 per cent said hotel wi-fi access was too costly, according to the YouGov survey of 2,000 people.

A third thought the price of food and drink around major tourists hotspots was too expensive, as was the price of entrance tickets to attractions.

Forty per cent also complained about the high charges for using debit or credit cards overseas, as well as fees for using foreign cash machines.

Counting the cost: People cited the high charges for using credit and debit cards abroad as a top holiday gripe

These hidden charges can add more than five per cent to the total cost of goods being bought or amount of cash being withdrawn.

A fifth of people complained that buying UK-branded goods, such as food or newspapers, costs too much in foreign countries.

James Hickman, managing director of foreign exchange company Caxton FX, which commissioned the research from YouGov, said: 'It is clear that the nation feels there are a host of rip-offs to be aware of when holidaying abroad.'

Referring to cash machines, Mr Hickman added: 'It is always best to avoid the trap of charges
and make it a habit to pay in the local currency while abroad.

'Too many
Brits end up shelling out for extra charges because they are too 
embarrassed to take out their calculator and work out the difference.'

YouGov asked people to list their top five holiday rip-offs as part of the survey.

Although Britons had a long list of things that they felt were too expensive, the research also found that people do not spend wisely when on holiday.

Four in ten travelers do not save spending money for their holidays prior to leaving the UK, while a fifth admit to going over budget when away from home.

Debit/Credit card charges    40%
