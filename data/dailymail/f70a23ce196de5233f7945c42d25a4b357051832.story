On the day that would have been Phillip Hughes' 26th birthday, Australian cricket captain Michael Clarke has penned a touching letter to Sean Abbott, the man who was bowling when Hughes sustained his head injury.

Hughes passed away on Thursday afternoon after being struck by a bouncer at the SCG on Tuesday, and since then tributes have flooded in from not just around Australia but from cricket fans and mourners worldwide. 

In a tribute reported by The Sunday Telegraph, Clarke has urged Abbott that the support of the nation is behind him during such a trying time, calling the tragedy a 'freak accident.'

But in perhaps the most moving aspect of the piece, the cricket captain offered bowler Abbott his personal support when the time comes for him to 'get back on the horse'.

'Sean, when you feel like getting back on the horse mate, I promise you that I will be the first to strap on the pads and go stand up the end of the net to hit them back at you. It’s exactly what Hugh Dog would want us both to do,' Clarke wrote.

Aside from this touching show of solidarity, the Australian cricket captain also used the letter to express his gratitude for the wider Australian community, thanking them for the 'wonderful words of support for Phillip’s family and team mates'.

He added that despite the fact that the Hughes family are currently facing unimaginable pain over the loss of the cricketer, they have taken comfort in the outpouring of grief from all corners of the world.

Clarke paid tribute to Hughes' hometown of Macskville on the NSW north coast, acknowledging all those who nurtured his passion for cricket from a young age.

'From his junior team mates, to the coaches up on the north coast who noticed and nurtured his prodigious talent, to the umpires who would have tired of signalling his endless 4’s through point,' Clarke wrote in The Daily Telegraph.

He sent thoughts and prayers to all those grieving the tragic loss of such a young man doing what he loved, and said he had been moved by the 'best qualities' of Australians that had been on show this week.

On Saturday Clarke delivered an incredibly emotional address which captured the grief so much of the nation is currently experiencing.

Speaking on behalf of Cricket Australia the captain broke down in tears as he spoke about his 'little brother'.

On the same day it was revealed that Australia's first test against India would be pushed back in order to allow the players to grieve. 

'These are extraordinary circumstances and we simply couldn’t or wouldn’t expect our players to be emotionally ready to start a Test match the day after farewelling one of their teammates,' Cricket Australia CEO James Sutherland said.'
