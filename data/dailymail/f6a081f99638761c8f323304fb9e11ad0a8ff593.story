Accused: Drew Peterson, 57, pictured in 2009, has been imprisoned for the past three years awaiting trial for the death of his third wife, Kathleen Savio

Drew Peterson introduced himself to 
would-be jurors today as jury selection began in the former suburban 
Chicago police officer's long-delayed murder trial.

Peterson, 58, is charged with killing 
his third wife, Kathleen Savio, in 2004.

Her body was found in a dry 
bathtub in her home, her hair soaked with blood.

The ex-Bolingbrook 
police sergeant also is a suspect in the 2007 disappearance of his 
fourth wife, Stacy Peterson, although he has not been charged.

Peterson, his trademark mustache shaved off, stood and spoke to some 40 potential jurors as proceedings began today.

'Good morning ladies and gentlemen, I'm Mr Peterson,' he said in a steady voice.

During the trial, jurors are likely to 
hear statements the women allegedly made to friends and relatives about 
threats Peterson made.

Such hearsay is usually barred, but an appellate 
court ruled jurors can hear the statements.

The 200-person jury pool has been 
waiting three years for a trial to get under way. It was put off because
of appellate court battles over the hearsay statements.

'I've never heard of anything comparable
to this — a jury pool waiting around for so long knowing what case 
they're going to be in and the reliance on hearsay,' said Gal Pissetzky,
a Chicago defense lawyer with no link to the case.

Publicity in the case is an issue as the
judge and attorneys question jurors. The legal saga surrounding 
Peterson and whether he used his status as a police officer to try to 
get away with murder has attracted national attention.

Rob Lowe 
portrayed Peterson in a 2011 TV movie, Drew Peterson: Untouchable.

The defense raised concerns that some 
prospective jurors may have violated orders to avoid all news about 
Peterson.

Some of the half dozen would-be jurors questioned by the judge on
Monday acknowledged they have been unable to completely avoid the 
television, radio and newspaper coverage of the case.

One man said that when he hears 
Peterson's name on the radio he switches it off or leaves the room.

But 
the man said that just last week he saw Peterson's photograph splashed 
across the front page of a suburban Chicago newspaper.

One woman who was asked what she thinks she's heard about the case answered: 'Something about a bathtub.'

Vetting would-be jurors typically takes a
few days, but extra time is sometimes required in high-profile cases to
weed out those who come in with well-formed opinions.

Opening 
statements at Peterson's trial in Joliet are slated for next Tuesday.

Jurors are likely to hear from a parade 
of pathologists who will dispute each other's conclusions about how Kathleen Savio died, aged just 40.

They will hear about her death being ruled an 
accident, her body being exhumed after 23-year-old Stacy Peterson's 
disappearance and the autopsy after which her cause of death was changed
from accidental to homicide — and the continued dispute over those 
findings.

There's apparently no physical evidence, so the hearsay is the heart of prosecutors' case.

Before jury selection began today, Will
County Judge Edward Burmila refused prosecutors' request to give them 
blanket approval to admit eight key hearsay statements.

Burmila said he 
will make a final ruling on the admissibility of each statement only as 
they come up at trial.

Neither Burmila nor the attorneys spoke in any detail about the substance of the eight statements.

At a 2010 hearing to determine what 
hearsay a jury could hear, dozens of witnesses testified that Savio told
them she feared Peterson would kill her and make it look like an 
accident.

One question looming over the trial is 
how much Peterson's personality will influence the jury. Before his 
arrest, Peterson was often seen joking about a 'Win A Date With Drew' 
contest, his missing wife's menstrual cycle and other topics that were 
widely seen as inappropriate.

Peterson often joked with an army of news crews camped outside his house and even invited Geraldo Rivera into his kitchen.

Brodsky has said the three years that 
Peterson has been in jail and largely out of the public eye might help 
him because the memories of his behavior have faded.

Peterson, jailed since his 2009 arrest, 
pleaded not guilty. His attorneys say Savio's death was an accident and 
that Stacy Peterson — 30 years younger than Drew Peterson — ran off with
another man and is alive.

Authorities have said they believe she is 
dead, although her body has never been found.

The frenetic coverage 'absolutely
has the possibility of reigniting,' said Mark Geragos, a prominent 
California defense attorney who has been at the center of comparable 
firestorms, including when he represented Scott Peterson (no relation), a
California man convicted of murdering his young wife and unborn child.

Prosecutors
expect to tell a relatively simple story: Drew Peterson killed his 
ex-wife to keep her from making off with much of his money in a 
contentious divorce.

Sometime around February 29, 2004, 
according to the indictment, Peterson went to Savio's house and in the 
bathroom caused her 'to inhale fluid', killing her.

Observers say Peterson may benefit 
from the three years he's been behind bars and out of the public eye, if
only because he spent much of the past three years in solitary 
confinement, with his only human contact being from guards bringing him 
meals.

'He really was 
becoming one of the more hated individuals in America,' Joe Tacopina, a 
prominent defence attorney in New York. 'Because he was in 
jail, he took himself off the front page, and that can only help him 
with a jury pool.'

Peterson's
attorney agreed. 'Nobody's going to deny that Drew's relatively goofy 
behaviour rubbed people the wrong way,' said Joel Brodsky, who explained
Peterson's actions as both the by-product of a sometimes grim job and 
his way of moving on after his wife left him.

'The fact that he hasn't been at that for a period of years certainly helps some of his past antics fade from memory.'

Missing: Peterson, right, is also the chief suspect in the disappearance of his fourth wife, Stacy Peterson, right

But
that simple story is complicated by what happened after Savio's body 
was discovered by a friend of Peterson's. Peterson had called the friend
to the house to look for Savio, saying he was worried.

Detectives are expected to testify, 
as they did at a hearing in 2010, that nobody collected a single 
fingerprint or hair fiber at the house.

They will likely acknowledge 
that Savio's relatives, who could have told investigators about the 
couple's on-going battles, were never interviewed.

Jurors
may also hear, as a judge did at the 2010 hearing, that Peterson was 
allowed to sit in on a police interview with Stacy Peterson as a 
'professional courtesy'. This happened while officers were trying to 
confirm Peterson's whereabouts the weekend Savio died.

The one-time policeman of the year, told a reporter at the Chicago Sun Times: 'I’m sick of being called sinister.'

Instead
he insisted he was a romantic and his disastrous track record with 
women was not his fault - it was because he picked 'women who changed 
after getting married'.

Authorities then reopened the 
investigation into the March 2004 death of his third wife Kathleen 
Savio, who was initially thought to have drowned accidentally in her 
bathtub.

But it was reclassified as a homicide after her body was exhumed and a medical examiner ruled she drowned following a struggle.

Peterson was arrested and charged with her death in May 2009 and is being held on $20million bail.

During the 30-minute interview in the jail's visitor center, Peterson 
spoke about his children claiming to be a good father.

He said his sons with Kathleen Savio, Thomas and Kristopher, had never asked him if he had
killed their mother because they knew he had not.

He also said that he told his youngest children, Anthony and Lacy, that their mother Stacy was on vacation.

They
are currently being looked after by one of his son's from his first 
marriage - Peterson has six children from three of his four marriages.

When asked if he missed Stacy he said
he did sometimes, but said if she did reappear the first thing he would
do is 'ask her to sign the divorce papers'.

He
said his last girlfriend Christina Raines has asked him to marry her 
three years ago, but he had not seen her since she had become 
intimidated by the press.

Last
year it emerged that Peterson had written a dozen jail-house love 
letters from jail, repeatedly propositioning a woman he has known since 
she was 14.

Diana 
Grandel, now 40, said the former Illinois police sergeant has been 
plaguing her with bizarre and increasingly sexual requests, like asking 
for her measurements, photos of her in a bikini as well as describing 
what he wants to do to her in bed.

He also asked her if she had any sexually transmitted diseases.

In
letters, obtained by the National Enquirer, he wrote to her: 'I just 
think of your smile and holding you in the dark feeling your body 
against mine...I want to spend a lot of time with my lips on yours.

'I like sex with a lot of foreplay, I'm more into pleasing my partner than pleasing others.'

Peterson
spoke to Miss Grandel about the disappearance of his fourth wife, 
sticking to his story that she walked out on him, saying she could have 
all her clothes.
