D-Day: British troops landed on beaches in Normandy as part of the allied invasion of France on June 6, 1944

While the vast majority had heard of the First and Second World Wars, youngsters were stumped at more recent conflicts such as the War on Terror and the troubles in Northern Ireland.

The statistics emerged in a study by Universal Pictures to mark the release of a special range of DVDs in support of The Royal British Legion.

Charles Byrne, The Royal British Legion’s Director of Fundraising, said: ‘With this year’s 70th commemorations of D-Day and the 100th Anniversary of the start of the First World War, we hope more young people will be engaged by key events in military history.

‘Encouragingly, a lot of young people
 say their knowledge of military history comes from school, and we know 
the Legion’s free school’s pack on Remembrance and History reaches 2 
million young people in the UK every year.

The Bloody Sunday killings in 1972 took place during a civil rights march in Londonderry, Northern Ireland. Thirteen civilians were killed while the 14th victim died from his wounds five months later

‘We
 can also see that conflicts shown in TV and films make a big impact so 
would encourage everyone to pick up a DVD in this special range.’

The study of 2,000 18-35-year-olds found
 that almost half of those polled didn't know that D-Day marks the Normandy Landings during the Second 
World War, with more than one in five mistakenly believing it marks the 
end of the First World War.

Half
 were also unaware VE Day (Victory in Europe Day), which took place last
 week, is celebrated to mark the end of the Second World War in Europe.

The survey found that young people knew about conflicts from television and films including the 2008 film The Hurt Locker (pictured) with Jeremy Renner as Sergeant First Class William James

Still celebrated to this day, VE day, as well as D-Day, mark significant moments in British history.

D-Day, or the day of the Normandy Landings on June 6, 1944, marked the start of the European invasion during the Second World War.

Thousands of allied troops landed on the beaches in Northern France initiating the effort to liberate mainland Europe from Nazi occupation.

In total 75,215 British and Canadian troops and 57,500 US troops were landed by sea on D-Day. Another 23,400 were landed by air – it was the largest seaborne invasion in history.

Victory in Europe Day (VE Day) was the public holiday, celebrated on May 8, 1945, to mark the formal acceptance of Germany’s surrender in the Second World War.

People gathered on the streets - many dressed in red, white and blue - to celebrate the fact the war was over.

One in four also struggled to name 1914 
to 1918 as the dates of the First World War, while one in five had no 
idea the Second World War took place from 1939 to 1945.

More than a quarter of those surveyed were totally unaware of the war in Afghanistan, with even fewer admitting they knew about the Iraq war.

And despite it taking place in living memory for all those polled, just 40 per cent knew that the Iraq war started in 2003.

Instead, one in ten thought it was the day the Blitz came to an end.

There was also a large number who admitted to knowing little or even to have never heard of the Cold War and Vietnam.

The study also found that while 45 per cent say most of the knowledge they do have on the nation’s military history comes from their time at school, almost one in five, or 18 per cent,  picked up what they do know from TV programmes or Hollywood films.

Less than one in twenty got their knowledge from talking to older grandparents or relatives.

And surprisingly  almost four in ten said they have never spoken to older relatives or friends about their experiences living through military events in our past.
