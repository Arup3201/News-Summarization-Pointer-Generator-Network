A woman has undergone surgery to remove shrapnel from her stomach after her husband threw a grenade at her in the street following an argument

A woman has undergone surgery to remove shrapnel from her stomach after her husband allegedly threw a grenade at her in the street following an argument.

A 55-year-old Bosnian man is being questioned after the incident in the town of Buchs in the canton of Aargau, Switzerland.

According to a report from the SDA news agency the 59-year-old woman, who was estranged from her husband, alerted police to the attack about an hour after it happened.

She initially attempted to minimise the incident and said she only had a finger injury.

But she was in pain and a hospital admission revealed she had shaprnel embedded into her stomach.

Investigators discovered parts of the grenade in the street - it was so powerful its detonation blew out a window in a nearby house, reported The Local.

Together with the Forensic Institute Zurich, investigators came to the conclusion that it was a 'splinter grenade' hand-made in the former Yugoslavia.

An analysis showed that the grenade was hand-made years ago, according to police.

The man - who has not been named - was caught on Sunday at the Italian border in Chiasso, in the canton of Ticino, after he returned from a brief visit to his home country.

It is not clear what the motive for the hand grenade attack was.

The woman is understood to be recoveing well and an investigation into the case continues.
