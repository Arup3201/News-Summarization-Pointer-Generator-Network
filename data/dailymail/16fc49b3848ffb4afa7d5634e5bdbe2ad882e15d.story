Sean Dyche tossed his jacket aside in this match and he’s now going to have to roll up his sleeves.

That’s two games and two defeats for his promoted Burnley side. Granted, one was against Chelsea and this was away from home against a side who won at Manchester United on the opening day.

But already, at this extremely early stage, the Ginger Mourinho looks like he needs a few more creative thinkers on the pitch. Time and again Burnley held possession — 45 per cent, which is good going in these parts — but lacked the wit to find a way through a backline that performed well, yet still appears the weak point of this side.

Unfortunately for Dyche, it was his own defence that buckled, making Burnley’s lack of penetration up front all the more telling.

Nathan Dyer’s goal was avoidable, the ‘outstanding negative’ in Dyche’s words after Ben Mee made a hash of an interception and Michael Duff hesitated in closing Dyer down.

‘I was just explaining to them that we showed too much respect in the first half,’ said Dyche. ‘That can happen to promoted teams. I have been through it myself.

‘We are not naive enough to think the growth period doesn’t have to be quick because it does.’ The last point was telling. Indeed, they learnt something of a lesson in the break, re-emerging with far more purpose and disregard for what was coming at them.

They were at least the equal of Swansea in the second half.

But the test will come from creating proper chances and taking them, which is what Burnley failed to do here. Had they shown similar precision to Swansea, they might have taken a point, a reward more tangible than the ‘encouraging’ signs to which Dyche pointed.

‘Swansea are good but they are not Chelsea yet,’ he added. ‘They are a very good side. But it was a more realistic challenge. We didn’t get anything and that is the challenge. But at least the players will know they can compete at this level.’

For Garry Monk, this was a second win in two, increasing the sense that he is the right man to lead the club. He spoke this week of banishing mobile phones from Swansea’s canteen and kicking out agents two days before a game.

The measures were aimed at fostering a more united squad than that of last season. Already, he has been able to point to a performance of more grit than usual.

Monk said: ‘In the first half we controlled the game. We spoke at half-time that they would throw everything at us and we weren’t at our fluent best, but we dug in and defended well.

‘There are times when you have to dig in and the boys were magnificent in that respect. I have been involved in so many games where we play well and get nothing.

‘Six points in two games is all you can ask for,’ he added.

Initially, this looked like it could be a terrible afternoon for Dyche. Within a minute he was on his feet; within three Swansea had an excellent chance. Jonjo Shelvey won possession in his own half before the ball found Wayne Routledge on the right.

He jinked into the box, saw that Wilfried Bony had been given too much space near the penalty spot and delivered a perfect cross. Jason Shackell cleared the Ivorian’s header off the line.

Danny Ings then volleyed over, but for the first half that was as good as it got for Burnley.

Their main issue, in the early stages, was midfield — or, more precisely, their lack of one.

Swansea’s 4-2-3-1 system and the extra man they were afforded against a 4-4-2 proved significant, even if Shelvey was having one of those days in midfield where his good and sloppy traits took turns to show up.

In one five-minute passage of the first half he passed straight into touch. Then he hit a precise pass 50 yards into the path of Routledge, who was wide on the left. The winger beat Kieran Trippier and his low cross perfectly met the run of Gylfi Sigurdsson.

The Iceland midfielder glanced his shot from seven yards when something a little more forceful would have done the job. Tom Heaton made the save but it was a major let-off, albeit a temporary one.

Within a further five minutes, Swansea were ahead. Sigurdsson was involved, playing a through-ball from the middle that Mee reached but allowed to squirm past.

Dyer took possession, motored away from Mee and carried on his surge into the area when Duff continued to back away. Heaton got a hand to the near-post shot but not enough to stop it.

Dyche estimated earlier this month that he had made 500 calls over transfers in a bid to keep Burnley up. He has acknowledged he might need to make a few more over the next week.

Bony miskicked from the edge of the area after the restart and Dyche’s jacket came off.

Monk, new to a suit after feeling he ‘earned the right to wear one’ in his caretaker spell last season, was less ruffled, despite a less than energetic start to the second half.

Swansea almost paid for their lethargy when Ings took possession on the left of the Swansea area and threaded a pass to David Jones, whose shot across goal beat Lukasz Fabianski but was heading wide. Lukas Jutkiewicz was inches away from connecting with a lunge.

It was close, but not close enough. And Dyche will know that simply won’t do.
