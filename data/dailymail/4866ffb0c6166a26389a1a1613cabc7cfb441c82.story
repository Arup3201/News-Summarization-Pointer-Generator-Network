Forget 'moves like Jagger', 93-year-old Pauline Davis shows that it's 'moves like granny' folk should be replicating.

The great-great-grandmother from Friendship, Tennessee, was filmed as she boogied away to Billy Ray Cyrus' hit Nineties track Achy Breaky Heart at home in the living room.

With a smile on her face, she buoyantly hops from one foot to the other.

She also swings her arms in time to the beat. 

As she gets into the groove she adds music to her moves and starts reciting some of the lyrics.

Her great-great-granddaughter joins the performance.

Dressed in her night gown, the youngster energetically skips around her elder with her arms out wide.

Family members say that Davis always has so much energy and never sits still. 

Along with dancing, she enjoys cooking and collecting dolls.

'She is a hoot to be around never a dull moment,' a relative added.
