A future king sleeps peacefully in the arms of his doting mother in a family snapshot... taken by his grandfather.

Previous royal heirs, Prince William included, have had their first official portraits taken by society legends such as Sir Cecil Beaton and Lord Snowdon.

But Prince George Alexander Louis of Cambridge owes his to a humble ‘point and shoot’ wielded by Kate’s father, Michael Middleton.

Sun and heir: Mr Middleton opted to shoot straight into the light for his snapshot of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and baby George, and managed to cut off the nose of retriever Tilly, left. The Cambridge's cocker spaniel Lupo, right, emerged unscathed

That's better: Mr Middleton's second photo produces much more appealing results, with the couple and their sleeping prince emerging from the blinding sunlight

And the setting? The Middletons’ 
sun-dappled back garden in Berkshire, with family pets Lupo and Tilly 
even getting in on the act.

The
 finished result may have charm but is technically poor and lacks the 
gravitas of previous official photographs, according to experts.

Critics will also no doubt seize on Mr Middleton’s decision to break the cardinal rule of photography – shooting into the light.

But according to celebrity photographer Brian Aris, the snapshots are ‘refreshing’.

He told the Mail: ‘It’s an unusual decision but perhaps reflects the young approach that Prince William wants to bring to bear.

‘The
 decision to take them in such an informal manner means they, perhaps, 
lack the level of gravitas that would normally be expected.

'But on the whole I would say this is quite refreshing.’

He added: ‘Taking a professional portrait of a young baby is quite an intrusive procedure, given the lighting and strobes you would need.

‘So perhaps they have had the right idea after all. It’s just a different approach and the images are rather charming.’

Kensington Palace said the photographs
 were taken with an inexpensive camera in early August while the Duke 
and Duchess of Cambridge were staying with internet millionaires Carole 
and Michael Middleton at their £4.8million Berkshire mansion.

Both
 photos show the couple posing with George, who is swaddled in the same 
shawl by Nottinghamshire firm G H Hurt and Son Ltd that he left hospital
 in.

Kate is wearing a £46 fuchsia-coloured knot front dress by maternity wear firm Seraphine, but appears to have shed a great deal of her baby weight.

William is casually dressed in a blue checked shirt, tucked into jeans, and his favourite African-style belt.

Both look a little baggy-eyed due to lack of sleep – the prince more than his wife – but are clearly overjoyed at being parents to a beautiful, healthy baby boy.

Given the illustrious history of royal family portraits, the Cambridges' decision to use one of proud grandpa Mike's happy family snaps is a startling break with tradition. 

According to well-placed sources, the decision was very much William’s and Kate’s.

It is understood the couple were keen 
‘not to burst the happy little family bubble’ they have existed in at 
the Middleton family home since George’s birth.

First shots: Mr Middleton's images are the first pictures of the young Royals since Prince George was introduced to the world outside St Mary's Hospital last month

‘They
 are a young couple who have just had their first baby and are enjoying 
time as a family together but, of course, there has been huge demand 
from the public to see some official photographs of Prince George,’ said
 an aide.

‘It seemed 
perfectly natural to them to pose for a few nice family snapshots which 
they could then issue. It [the Middleton family home] is just where they
 feel happy and most comfortable.’

The
 Mail also understands the couple were keen to take the wind out of the 
sails of the huge international market for unofficial paparazzi pictures
 of George by releasing their own as soon as possible.

The first official portrait of Prince Charles is a study in royal portraiture.

Taken
 by legendary English photographer, Sir Cecil Beaton, the image of the 
Queen gazing at her son was shot at Buckingham Palace in December 1948 
when he was just a month old.

Fast-forward
 more than 30 years, and a startled-looking Prince William is introduced
 to the world by the Queen’s brother-in-law Lord Snowdon, another 
celebrated photographer.

Although
 more relaxed, the photo is still a formal portrait of a future king, 
proudly showing off the next generation of the family line.

The
 Duke and Duchess of Cambridge’s decision to use one of Mike Middleton’s
 happy family snaps is thus a substantial break with tradition.

According
 to sources, the decision was very much William and Kate’s. ‘It’s where 
they feel happy and most comfortable,’ said an aide.

They went on to explain that the pictures were a mark of thanks for the privacy they had been given after the birth.

‘They asked the media to give them some time as a family and the British media have done that,’ they said.

Kate Middleton’s father ignored photography advice on his own website when he took the first snaps of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge with Prince George.

The Party Pieces website tells amateur photographers to ensure ‘natural light is behind you’ when taking pictures at family occasions.

But in his images of the couple with the newborn prince, Mr Middleton pictured them with the sun behind them, casting their faces into shadow.

Other advice on the site includes dressing children so their outfits don’t clash and using ‘toilet humour’ to make them laugh.

As the photographer, Michael Middleton is automatically entitled to copyright of the image under the Copyright Designs and Patents Act.

But last night it emerged that he has already handed over ownership of the pictures.

This means he won’t be entitled to any money when they are printed – and Kate and William will be able to control their use.
