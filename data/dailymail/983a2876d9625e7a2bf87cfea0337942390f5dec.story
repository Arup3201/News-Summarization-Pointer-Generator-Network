A teenage ice hockey player has been left paralysed by a dangerous hit from behind during a game just days after a 16-year-old was told he would never walk again following a similar incident.

St Croix Luther High senior Jenna Privette, from Minnesota, was hospitalised after she was 'checked' from behind during a game on Friday night. She fell to the ice and was unable to move.

Her injury comes only a week after Benilde St Margaret's player Jack Jablonski,16, was left paralysed for life in an almost identical incident just miles away.

Passion: Despite receiving a similar ice hockey injury before, it did not deter Jenna Privette, 18, from returning to the game she loves

Danger: Jenna was slammed into the boards from behind when an opposing player checked her. She fell to the ice and didn't move

Injury: ice hockey star Jack Jablonski fractured two bones
in his lower neck as well as severing his spinal chord and is unlikely 
to be able to walk ever again

Ironically, right before the game which left her in hospital, Jenna, 18, wrote on her Facebook page that she would be playing in honour of Jack and had even chaged her profile picture to the number 13 - which was the teen's player number - and the words 'Jack Jablonski, always in our hearts'.

Before the game, she wrapped her stick in red tape as a tribute to the 16-year-old.

Jenna is being treated at the Hennepin County Medical Centre in Minneapolis but doctors are confident she will make a full recovery as she has not broken her spinal chord, as in Jack's case - who was told he will likely never walk again as a result of the injury.

Though she still has no feelings in her legs, she has pain and tingling in her arms and upper body, which is a 'good sign', according to her parents.

Recovery: Though she only has feeling in parts of her upper body and none in her lower, doctors are confident she will make a full recovery as her spinal chord has not been broken

Parents: Dan and Penny Privette, of Burnsville, said they are remaining optimistic about her recovery as she has suffered a similar injury before and was given the OK to return to the ice

Dan and Penny Privette, of Burnsville, said they are remaining optimistic about her recovery as she has suffered a similar injury before and was given the OK to return to the ice, though it is still too early to say whether or not her injuries will be permanent.

Mr Privette told the Star Tribune: 'She's irritable and in a lot of pain, which is,
in a way, kind of good.'

Jenna's mother is calling for a changes in the game, as did Jack Jablonski's mother after her son's devastating injury.

She said: 'The system needs to be reformed. Checking is getting so out of control.'

A video of the game clearly shows the 18-year-old being checked into the boards from behind and falling immediately to the ice.

The two incidents have caused players, parents and coaches to call for an overhaul of the rules of checking in ice hockey - which is one of the most common defensive techniques.

Harsher penalties and and better warnings on the dangers of such aggressive hits are advised, as tensions among the Minnesota ice community have reached an all-time high following the reports of the two injuries.

Love: Friends and family have been rallying around 18-year-old Jenna, right, as she recovers in hospital

Tribute: Hours before the game, Jenna changed her Facebook profile picture to honour Jack Jablonski, left, who was paralyzed after a December 30 game, and in a similar fashion, a Facebook page has been set up for Jenna, with her number and 'In Our Hearts' also included, right

Hospital: Doctors at first did not know how severe the injuries were but confirmed yesterday that he was paralyzed for life

Ken Pauly, head coach at Benilde, agrees that the sport faces questions and that checking from behind needs to be addressed.

He told the Minnesota Star Tribune: 'I don't know how you couldn't have some hard questions after this. My take is, you can't legislate against tragedy. But what can you do to lessen the likelihood that a tragedy will occur?

'That said, the permissive culture of 
checking from behind is an issue. Why would that not be treated like 
fighting? Do we need rule changes? No. We need a change in mentality.'

Jenna was playing for her team, the Minnehaha Saints, against the St Paul Blades on Friday night. After firing a shot on goal, she was allegedly checked into the boards from behind by an opposing defender.

Fundraising: A joint Facebook support page has been set up for the two injured teens

According to St Croix athletic director Carl Lemke, the high school senior almost immediately lost feeling throughout most of her body.

'She's had an MRI, and it did not show breaks in the spinal cord, which makes it different than Jablonski's [injury],' Mr Lemke told the Star Tribune. 'It's an injury she's had in the past. Hopefully, it will improve.'

Last week, Jack Jablonski's mother Leslie alarmingly warned: 'We just want to make sure this doesn't happen again. And if they keep playing the game the way it is, there's going to be more attacks in situations like this.'

Mrs Jablonski went to visit Jenna in hospital to offer her support and bring a get well card.
