There are few summer Olympic champions who would buy a £500 pair of camera goggles to try to reach speeds of 62mph hurtling down a ski slope during the off-season. 

Even fewer would relish the thought of rushing head-first down an ice track on a bob skeleton sled. But then Greg Rutherford admits he is a ‘possibly a bit bonkers’. 

The Olympic and Commonwealth gold medallist would happily jump out of an aeroplane if he had not convinced himself his parachute would not open. He has skied since he was three, spent his childhood summers jumping off 30ft cliffs into water in the Peak District and wants to try bungee-jumping when he retires.

Going the distance: Rutherford jumped further than any of his rivals yet again at the Commonwealth games

Golden boy: The Olympic champion added the Commonwealth title to his list of achievements

Rutherford, 27 and with his first child on the way this autumn, also has ambitions to try skeleton in September with a view to switching sports in 2018, believing his speed and power would transfer well from long jump to an ice track.

‘If you catch a good jump it is a beautiful feeling of flying, so there is definitely some correlation there,’ he says.

His enthusiasm is refreshing, but there is just one problem: Rutherford is a notoriously fragile athlete. His former coach, Dan Pfaff, reckoned he tore his hamstrings 17 times before winning Olympic gold at London 2012, while Rutherford nearly quit athletics altogether last summer after rupturing the muscle at the back of his left thigh.

‘I’m sort of thinking it’s not as hard, being in a crouch position running with a tea tray, jumping on it and praying you don’t hit your head,’ he says, smiling.

Up for it: The athlete says he doesn't care that his Olympic winning distance was the shortest since 1972

‘The weird thing I find in this country is that when you decide to have ambitions outside the one thing you do in life people find it very offensive. People are saying “How dare you want to do another sport?” but I’ve just got ambitions to do other things. I’ve got so much more to achieve first.

‘I want to retain my Olympic title in a couple of years, and if I get that done, I will consider that a pretty successful long-jumping career, so maybe I will turn my hand to a different sport. If I didn’t do that, I would always wonder.

According to some, he was ‘lucky’ to win Olympic gold on ‘Super Saturday’ with 8.31 metres, the shortest winning distance since 1972. 

‘Only’ 8.20m was enough to add the Commonwealth title last month. The legality of the new British record of 8.51m he set this year was questioned by team-mate Chris Tomlinson.

He could back up Commonwealth gold by winning the European Championships in Zurich this week. 

A field containing the likes of world champion Aleksandr Menkov, 2010 European gold medallist Christian Reif, Louis Tsatoumas of Greece and France’s Salim Sdiri will, however, provide stiffer competition than Rutherford faced in Glasgow.

Rutherford knows he may well have to break the British record again to win in Switzerland.

Finally, though, that might just shut everyone up.

Rutherford said: ‘I won an Olympic Games by half a foot, which you would say is a good distance to win by. But then people dwell on the fact it was the shortest winning distance since ’72... but I don’t care. I don’t care.’
