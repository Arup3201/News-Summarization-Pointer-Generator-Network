Alive: Arthur Gerald Jones, 72, disappeared more than 30 years ago

The man who forced a probe that found a former commodities broker alive after he disappeared in 1979 and was declared legally dead has been revealed as a Phoenix nurse.

Clifton Goodenough, 50, a nurse in a veterans’ hospital in Arizona, fought with the Internal Revenue Service as they kept taking funds from his bank account and cutting his wages.

But after 16 years of grief, the mystery was solved when father-of-three Arthur Gerald Jones, 72, of Chicago, Illinois, was found living under a false name and working at a casino in Las Vegas, Nevada.

Jones was reported missing in 1979 and declared dead by an Illinois court in 1986. FBI agents had investigated his disappearance as suspicious and focused on possible mob connections.

Jones was arrested last Tuesday on four counts related to identity theft and fraud after officials say he renewed his Nevada driver's licence in 2008 under his assumed name, Joseph Richard Sandelli.

Jones allegedly paid a friend in Chicago $800 for fake documents and a Social Security number belonging to Mr Goodenough before he disappeared, authorities say, which caused the Arizona man untold grief.

Mr Goodenough was involved in a 
long-term battle with the IRS over ‘extra income’ he had supposedly 
earned in Las Vegas every year since 1995 and had annual financial 
issues to resolve.

He told MailOnline that he even went as far as to employ a certified public accountant because he was having so many financial issues to sort out.

The IRS were querying him 'every year or sometimes more,' he said.

Hideout: Jones settled in Las Vegas in 1988, where he worked for the Rampart Casino's Sports Book, authorities said

But eventually the IRS provided 
documents naming a person he could link to his troubles in ‘Sandelli’, 
who was using his Social Security number, reported the Las Vegas 
Review-Journal.

Mr Goodenough actually called 
‘Sandelli’ last year to chat about their shared problem on the phone, but he 
claims to have known something was up when they started discussing their
personal details.

‘The more I thought about it 
afterward, I realised he was just agreeing with whatever real 
information I'd say, to lead me to believe this was just a colossal 
government mix-up'

‘I told him I was born in a Lake 
Forest Hospital in Illinois, and he'd say: “So was I”,’ Mr Goodenough 
told the Las Vegas Review-Journal.

‘The more I thought about it 
afterward, I realised he was just agreeing with whatever real 
information I'd say, to lead me to believe this was just a colossal 
government mix-up.’

Mr Goodenough also thought it was odd
that ‘Sandelli’ allegedly offered to get a new number from the Social 
Security Administration even though he was around a retirement age.

But Mr Goodenough continued to get 
questions from the IRS about his earnings and eventually decided to 
write to Arizona Republican and U.S. Senator John McCain's office for 
help.

Four months later a huge 
investigation resulted in Jones allegedly admitting his story to investigators and
being charged. Mr Goodenough has praised Senator McCain's office ‘for 
getting me a resolution’.

‘I'm just still kind of shocked and 
amazed,’ he told the Las Vegas Review-Journal. ‘My family in Chicago 
keeps seeing my name in the news.’

Jones' lawyer, Stephen Stein, said 
last week the Nevada attorney general's office is offering his client a 
plea deal that would allow him to plead guilty on one of the charges and
face probation.

Jones was released on a $20,000 bond last week and is next set for an August 23 court hearing.

A criminal complaint filed last week 
in Las Vegas Justice Court painted the picture of a powerful Chicago 
financier tormented by snowballing gambling debts.

Jones told investigators he held a 
seat with the Chicago Board of Trade and lived with his wife, Joanne 
Esplin, and three young children in Highland Park, Illinois.

But Jones said he was forced to sell his board seat to pay debts, according to the affidavit.

Esplin said her husband forged her 
name to get a second mortgage on the couple's home and pay personal 
gambling debts, the document alleged. She said she suspected he was 
delivering money or running errands for the Chicago mob.

His marriage troubled and finances in
shambles, Jones told investigators he decided to leave to get a 'fresh 
start', the affidavit said. Esplin and Jones had been married 17 years 
when he disappeared.

According to the affidavit, Esplin 
told investigators the last time she saw her husband - whose gambling 
once led him to bet $30,000 on a basketball game - was May 11, 1979, 
when he left to run an errand. She said he looked very nervous at the 
time.

Jones never spoke to his family or 
friends again. Presuming he had died, Social Security paid his family 
$47,000 in survivor benefits, the document said.

Earlier this month, investigators 
from the Social Security Administration contacted Nevada Department of Motor Vehicles officials.

They were investigating Jones for using the Social Security number of 
Mr Goodenough.

Investigators say Jones used his 
‘Sandelli’ alias to get a Nevada driver's license when he moved to 
Nevada in 1988, and renewed it in 2008.

Authorities say he also lived in
Florida and California after leaving Chicago.

According to investigators, he moved he settled in Las Vegas in 1988, where he worked for the Rampart Casino's Sports Book.

Mr Stein said his client has friends in Las Vegas who 'consider him family' and who sprang to his defence after the arrest.

A DMV spokesman said cases like this 
are turning up more frequently as computer databases improve and law 
enforcement agencies are better able to communicate among themselves.
