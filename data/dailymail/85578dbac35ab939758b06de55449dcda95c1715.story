The ex-husband of Walmart heiress Paige Laurie has filed a lawsuit claiming he needs more than $400,000 a month in alimony because he has become accustomed to their lavish lifestyle, it is said.

In the suit, Patrick 'Bo' Dubbert, who separated from Paige, 32, last March after just six years of marriage, reportedly says he misses living in a multi-million dollar home and going on luxury holidays.

He claims his ex-wife should fork over between $210,000 and $240,000 every month after taxes (a gross amount of just over $400,000 a month) to help him adjust to his new single life, it is reported.

Heiress: In the suit, Bo, who separated from 32-year-old Paige (pictured) last March after just six years of marriage, reportedly says he misses living in a multi-million dollar home and going on luxury holidays

He would spend this money on 'necessities', including  a rental home (between $40,000 and $60,000 a month), a personal chef ($6,700 a month) and a personal trainer ($2,500 a month), according to TMZ.

Meanwhile, $30,000 a month would go on vacations, a staggering $80,000 every month would be spent on entertainment and a further $4,000 would be used to pay for a driver, Bo apparently claims.

Incredibly, he also wants Paige to pay him $2,500 so he can make charitable donations, it is said. 

In the suit, Bo reportedly points out that he had become accustomed to living in a $11million mansion with Paige, the daughter of Nancy Walton Laurie, whose father, Bud Walton, co-founded Walmart.

But since their separation, he has been splitting his time between an apartment in Santa Monica, California, (where he spends six months of the year) and his parents' home in Jefferson City, Missouri, he says.

He also claims that he had become used to $500,000 yacht parties, flying in a private jet and working for Paige's business, it is reported.

He says  the cash will help him get back into the job market.

Bo, who was previously accused of stealing thousands of dollars from the business he and Paige operated - a Malibu retail center - in another lawsuit, apparently cites his ex-wife's enormous wealth in the most recent suit. 

He claims Paige earns $872,000 a month from stocks and dividends, so she can easily afford to pay him the $400,000 a month he has requested it is said. And she should do so 'under 'California spousal support guidelines', Bo claims. 

Bo and Paige, who were high school sweethearts, married at a top-secret ceremony in Columbia, Missouri, in June 2008. Before the wedding, the couple signed a prenup to protect her fortune.

However, the prenup also provided Bo with the right to spousal support if they ever divorced.

Currently, Bo receives a $30,000 check every month, according to reports. This support will continue for three years - half the amount of time he and Paige were married, the celebrity news site reported.

Paige's mother Nancy, who owns a $200million super-yacht, and her sister Ann Walton Kroenke between them own a stake in the retail behemoth worth more than $6billion.

Nancy and Paige caused controversy in 2004 when they made a $25 million naming rights gift towards the building of a new $75million basketball arena at the University of Missouri in Columbia.

The peroxide blonde matriarch and her husband, Bill Lawrie, decided to name the facility Paige Sports Arena after their daughter. Neither parents nor daughter had ever attended the university.

Instead, Paige graduated that year from the University of Southern California. A former roommate told ABC’s 20/20 that she had been paid $20,000 over four years to do Paige's homework for her.

Once the allegations emerged, Paige’s parents agreed to let the school rename the arena which is now known as Mizzou Arena. In 2005, Paige voluntarily gave up her USC communication degree.
