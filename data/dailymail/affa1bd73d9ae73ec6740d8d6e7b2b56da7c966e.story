These incredible creations, featuring a range of familiar faces including cartoon characters such as the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Snoopy and Charlie Brown are almost too good to eat. 

Made from butter cookie dough and decorated with royal icing, the award-wining creations - which scooped Cake Masters Magazine's Cookie Award -  are the work of artist Mallory Mae who sells them at her family-run bakery, ButterWinks.

The 24-year-old, from Florida, has also replicated renowned works of art such as Van Gogh's Starry Night and Czech Art Nouveau painter and decorative artist Alphonse Mucha.

The sweet treats are decorated entirely by hand and the most detailed designs can take up to two days to complete - with the simplest taking as little as three to six minutes.

Ms Mae said: 'I have been drawing my entire life, so when I had a piping bag in my hand it just felt natural.

'I worked decorating cakes at a grocery store for a while and one day a customer added cookies to their order - doing the cookies felt so right and I decided I wanted to do it for myself.

'We set up ButterWinks and switched our focus solely to designing cookies.

'My favourite cookie is always the next big challenge and it is so hard to pick a favourite.

'There are so many to look back on but the ones that stand out to me are Starry Night and the Mongolia cookie I made for a feature in Cake Masters Magazine.'

The young baker is also in the process of building a new commercial kitchen which means ButterWinks will be able to ship cookies on a wholesale basis to almost anywhere.

Ms Mae has set up a Gofundme page for donations to help with the costs of the kitchen - for more information visit www.gofundme.com/ButterWinks.
