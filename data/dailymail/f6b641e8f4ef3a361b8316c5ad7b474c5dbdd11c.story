These birds have been hard at work setting up their new nest in time for the breeding season.

This series of photographs gives an insight into the elaborate process that South American ovenbirds, also known as el hornero (the house builder), go through to create their home, complete with a dome-shaped roof.

Using clay or mud mixed with fibres, hair or straw, the male and female ovenbirds work together to build the walls of their nest gradually during the winter months, allowing the tropical sun to bake the mud until it is rock hard.

And they're off: The South American ovenbirds, also known as el hornero (the house builder) start building their nests out of clay or mud mixed with fibres, straw and hair during the winter months

After picking an appropriate spot the walls go up first and are finished with the roof.

Then they build a narrow, curved entrance and dividing wall to create the breeding chamber which the female bird lines with grass and feathers, a process which can take months to complete.

After mating, the female lays three to five eggs that hatch after just 20 days because of the warmth trapped inside the nest.

House building: The birds add the mud gradually allowing the tropical sun to bake it until it is rock hard

Sharing the load: The male and female work together to pick an appropriate spot for their home and to build their nest in time for breeding season

Walls going up: The birds build the walls first before creating a dome-shaped roof

Time to rest: Building their nest is an elaborate process for 'the house builder' bird which can take months to complete

The chicks grow feathers within 18 days and stay with their parents in the nest for up to three months.

Ovenbirds are found in Mexico and Central and South America and are part of one of the largest families of birds.

They are recognisable by their unique song and are often found in settlements and on the outskirts of towns.

Interior design: The ovenbirds then build a dividing wall creating an entrance way and breeding chamber which the female lines with grass and feathers
