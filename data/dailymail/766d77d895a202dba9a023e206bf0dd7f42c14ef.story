There were hundreds of them living in the brothel, and when the men came they could do nothing but run.

The sex workers of the 200-year-old Kandapara brothel in Tangail, Bangladesh were forced to flee for their lives when a mob, backed by the local government, came armed with drums of petrol and threatened to set brothel  on fire in July this year.

The mob cut off the electricity and gave the sex workers two hours to vacate or they would burn to death.

Now, months later, many of the Kandapara prostitutes have moved to other brothels, while others have had no choice but to remain in Tangail, where they live in hiding, under constant threat from local residents. 

Although many still take clients in secret, four former Kandapara girls have been killed since the July eviction, and the women who remain fear for their safety without the protection of the brothel.

Broken lives: Former Kandapara brothel sex workers Razia Khatoon, 50, and Nilupa Yasmin 26,  look on as Asma Reyamoni, 13, born in the brothel, tends to Nilupa's son in her home in Tangail, Bangladesh

Born in a brothel: Asma was born into the Tangail brothel where her mother worked. She has stopped attending school in town because the students harassed her over her mother's work

Changes: Shazia, whose name has been changed to protect her identity, 48, walks through the medical clinic where she works part time as a maid. She was sent to Kandapara by her parents at a young age to work as a maid, and became a sex worker when she got older. 'I liked the environment and the people, day by day it turned into a habit for me and I enjoyed it.' she says. She lost all of her possessions in the eviction and now makes ends meet by taking one or two clients a week in secret

Nowhere else: Asma, the teenage daughter of a sex worker, plays with her neighbour Nilupa's son in Tangail, where many sex workers have remained since they were evicted living in secret under threat from local residents

Unstable future: Nilupa, seen with her two young sons, ran away from her parents when they tried to force her into marriage, and was found by a pimp who sold her into the Tangail brothel. Her madame beat her when she protested and tried to leave. She doesn't plan to continue working as a sex worker, 'I want to live a decent life for my kids now' she says

Born into prositution: Taslima, whose name has been changed to protect her identity, 40, was born into the brothel, her mother started working there when she was only 12 years old. 'When you're born into a brothel you have to be a sex worker' Taslima says. She started working as a sex worker when she was ten years old. She says the Tangail brothel was good, there were lots of NGOs helping them and she was able to live very independently, making up to 7,000 taka ($90) a week. Now she only makes up to 3,000 taka ($38) a week. 'I'm always scared when I take calls. Since the eviction some girls have taken a call for one man and there have been 5 or 6 when she gets there. If the government know that I'm living here they will murder me.' Taslima says

Living in fear: Razia, seen laughing with 13-year-old  Asma, used to be the Kandapara brothel's madame. Since the eviction she hasn't been able to work at all and is afraid that the townspeople will find her out and beat her

Destroyed: The demolished Kandapara Brothel in Tangail, Bangladesh, where hundreds of prostitutes lived and worked until July

Family: Parvin Shanti Akhter, 37, sitting with her daughter Asma, was married when she was 13 years old. After three years she ran away from her husband because he beat her, and she met a man who sold her into the brothel. Since the eviction she says 'We live like dogs, we can't even afford to eat. It's really hard, we're just breathing now. Sometimes I can't even find one client a week.'  She says that four girls have been murdered when they went to client calls and she's terrified every time she takes a client, adding that 'the townspeople have threatened to burn us alive if we show our faces in town'

No hope: Maya, 35, he was very young her parents got divorced and re married, and her father and mother's new spouses didn't want to take her in. She started working for a garment factory when she was 12 years old, and it was there that she met a man who promised her a better job with more money, and he sold her into a brothel. Three times she tried to escape from the brothel and each time the local police or local men caught her and brought her back to her madame for reward money. 'Life in the brothel was not so good. I didn't want to stay there but I was helpless and had nowhere else to go'

Former Madam Razia ran away from an abusive husband and ended up in the brothel when she was 20 years old. She says that it was a good environment, the girls were nice, it was safe, and she made good money

Hidden: Joya, whose name has been changed to protect her identity, 30, (left)  was only ten when a women picked her off the street and sold her into a brothel. Her mother eventually located her but her madame threatened to kill her and she left. Since the eviction she has been living in secret in town, fearing for her life if her neighbors find out she used to work in the brothel

No more crying: Bulboli, 25, says 'there are no tears left now'. 'I'm all alone. I don't go anywhere and I can't go back to my parents.' When Bulboli was ten, a man picked her off the street and sold her into a brothel. She eventually ran away and picked up clients independently, but went back to the brothel for safety. She used to make up to 1,000 taka (around $13) a day in the brothel, but now makes 1,000 taka (around $13) every two weeks. 'It's very hard to survive on 500 taka a week. Sometimes I only eat one meal a day'

New life: Maya, pictured hugging her daughter hasn't worked once since the eviction and has a hard time providing for her child
