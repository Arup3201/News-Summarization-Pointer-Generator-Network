Chelsea take on Slovenian opponents for the first time on Tuesday when NK Maribor visit Stamford Bridge.

The Blues – held 1-1 by Schalke in their last home outing – cannot afford another slip-up if they’re to enjoy a smooth passage into the knockout phase of the Champions League.

So who are the visitors from the former Yugoslavia? Sportsmail brings you more…

First things first, a bit of history?

In recent times they have been the dominant force of Slovenian football and are currently defending what would be a fifth straight title.

They were only formed in 1960 in the wake of NK Branik’s closure. Branik were another club from Maribor who were accused of poisoning their opponents ahead of a playoff match and were subsequently disbanded.

The newly-formed club survived a bribery scandal in the early Eighties – for which they were relegated to the Yugoslav third division – and following independence won the first Slovenian Cup in 1992.

Twelve titles and seven more cups have followed, as has participation in the Champions League, this season’s entry being their second in the competition’s group stages.

So how are they faring this season?

Luka Zahovic, son of Slovenian football legend Zlatko, has been in great form for NK Maribor this season 

They are six points off top in third position but have a game in hand over leaders Domzale and remain strong favourites to take the title, although they were beaten 2-1 at home to Celje on Saturday in what was a shock result.

They do, though, boast the league’s top scorer in the form of eight-goal Luka Zahovic.

Zahovic? I recognise that name…

Yes, the 18-year-old is the son of Slovenia’s greatest-ever player and record goalscorer, Zlatko, who is now the director of football at Maribor, his hometown club.

Luka was born in Portugal during his father’s playing career in the country and joined Benfica’s youth ranks before moving to Maribor as a teenager.

He is now a Slovenia youth international but qualifies to play for Portugal and is fluent in Slovenian, Portuguese, English and Spanish.

Who else should we look out for?

Brazilian striker Marcos Tavares is a club legend. The captain has scored 121 goals in eight seasons with Maribor and became the club’s record marksman in May. He is skilful and daring and is the one to watch, for sure.

Who is the boss?

Ante Simundza was assistant to Darko Milanic – the current Leeds boss – for three seasons before taking the reins himself in 2013.

He was a player back in 1999 when Maribor made it to the Champions League group stages and finished bottom after picking up four points from Lazio, Dynamo Kiev and Bayer Leverkusen.

What can we expect from them?

They’ll be well organised and compact with Tavares probably operating as a lone striker. They’ve forced two draws against Schalke and Sporting Lisbon and beat Celtic to reach the group stages. They’ll try to frustrate Chelsea in the hope that Tavares – or perhaps Zahovic from the bench – can nick a goal.

But given the disparity in quality of the two squads, the hosts should run out easy winners.
