A driver pulling into a fueling station in Massachusetts Monday struck an attendant, knocked over a pump and sparked a blaze after accidentally hitting the accelerator instead of the brake.

The fiery incident took place at around 11.30am at the 1A Auto Clinic in Walpole and was caught on a surveillance camera.

The footage shows the driver, 83-year-old Ed Grace, smashing his Toyota Avalon into a gas station worker, who was thrown on impact 30 feet in the air, according to police.

Bad move: The driver of this silver Toyota Avalon was trying to bring the vehicle to a stop in front of a pump at 1A Auto Clinic in Walpole, Massachusetts, but accidentally hit the accelerator

Before and after: A gas station attendant seen left before the crash was struck by the Toyota and thrown 30 feet in the air

The man's vehicle then careens into one of the pumps, which bursts into flames after being knocked off its base.

Moments later, another employee at the auto center could be seen rushing over with a fire extinguisher and putting out the blaze before it has a chance to spread to adjacent pumps. 

The gas station attendant involved in the crash escaped with bruises. The driver was left shaken by the collision but otherwise unharmed.

Speaking exclusively to CBS Boston Tuesday, a remorseful Mr Grace said it was all a terrible accident.

Scary moment: The tossed gas station attendant was able to crawl to the sidewalk while his quick-thinking co-worker extinguished the flames

The octogenarian explained that he was trying to bring his Toyota Avalon to a stop in front of a pump to fuel up, but instead his foot hit the gas pedal.

The motorist recounted seeing the injured service station employee crawling from the busy Main Street where he ended up to the sidewalk.

Mr Grace has not been charged in the incident, but his car has been impounded as police continued to investigate the crash.

The 83-year-old driver said he would consider giving up his license in the wake of the accident.

'Iâ€™m totally shook up,' he told the station. 'Iâ€™m still upset.'

The elderly motorist added that he would like to meet with the gas station attendant whom he had struck and apologize to him.

Aftermath: Grace has not been charged in the crash, but his car has been seized by police

The unnamed victim is being treated at Norwood Hospital for his injuries, and he is expected to make a full recovery.

Walpole Fire Chief Timothy Bailey told Wicked Local the flames ignited after the gas dispenser disconnected from the source after being hit.

It took three fire extinguishers to put out the conflagration.

The owner of the service station, John Nassar, said it will cost him $15,000 to replace the destroyed gas pump. He is waiting for his insurance agency to assess the damage.

'I'm going to lose business every day,' he added.
