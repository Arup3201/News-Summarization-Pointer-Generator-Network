A young black bear just overcame its own bucket challenge in western Pennsylvania with the help of some daring rescuers.

The Bucket Bear, as it had come to be called, had been roaming through Perry Township, Clarion County, for over a month with a black bucket-like object stuck on its head.

The Patriot-News reports that animal rescue volunteer Dean Hornberger planned the mission to free the Bucket Bear with his girlfriend Samantha Eigenbrod after seeing a photo of it on Facebook.

To the rescue: A group of volunteers conducted an impromptu rescue mission in the woods of Pennsylvania to free the Bucket Bear

The two rounded up a band of volunteers to assist in the rescue and set off for the woods near where the bear was photographed.

Hornberger and Eigenbrod had been searching for two hours and were about to call it quits for the day, when they came across the Bucket Bear near the highway.

Hornberger approached it and attempted to wrestle off the rubber container, which turned out to be an air bag that likely broke off a tractor trailer.

The bear slipped out of his grasp and led the group on a 20-minute chase through the woods towards 'the biggest mud hole in the area,' as Hornberger described it.

Once the group tackled the bear, Shawn Balcita pinned it down with his body while Hornberger cut the metal ring on the cushion with a hacksaw.

Eigenbrod recorded video of the brave rescue on her cellphone.

After Balcita released it, the Bucket Bear dashed back into the woods, freed of its cumbersome bucket.

According to Save the Bucket Bear, a Facebook page set up by Krissy Elder, the Pennsylvania Game Commission was contacted but told her they could not do anything while the bear was healthy and 'mobile.'

Balcita and Hornberger suffered some scratches from the bear's claws, but otherwise the group emerged unharmed.
