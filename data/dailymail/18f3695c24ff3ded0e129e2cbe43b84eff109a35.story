The son of longtime Boston Red Sox broadcaster Jerry Remy pleaded guilty to murder and other charges for stabbing his girlfriend last year and attacking people who tried to help her, and was immediately given the mandatory sentence of life in prison without parole.

Jared Remy, 35, admitted in Middlesex Superior Court that he fatally stabbed 27-year-old Jennifer Martel in August.

He described himself as 'the bad apple' and called Martel 'an angel' but said that he killed her one night because she had a knife and was threatening him.

Remy added: 'I would like to say, blame me for this and not my family. And if you asked my family, they’d rather have me dead than her,' the Boston Globe reported.

However he also added that he had warned Martel not to threaten him with taking custody of their daughter and this was the reason he had attacked her.

Remy said: 'I don’t think it’s right when women use their kids against their fathers.'

He also used his time in court to say that he wanted to send a message to two unidentified people to stop using the situation 'to make themselves look good'.

Remy pleaded guilty to first-degree murder, assault and battery, and violating a restraining order, among other charges.

His father, a former Red Sox second baseman who has been a color analyst on team broadcasts on the New England Sports Network since 1988, was not in court for the hearing.

Prosecutors described how Jared Remy repeatedly stabbed Martel, first in the couple's Waltham apartment as their four-year-old daughter screamed, and then as she crawled to an outside patio. Three neighbors tried unsuccessfully to pull Remy off Martel.

Assistant District Attorney Lisa McGovern said Remy stabbed Martel in the throat, legs, arms and torso, and pinched her face.

Before sentencing Remy, Judge Kathe Tuttman asked him if he disputed prosecutors' account of the stabbing.

'She had a knife in her hand. She was threatening me about my daughter,' Remy told the judge in a calm voice.

Tuttman quickly moved on and accepted the plea.

Remy was initially arrested August 13 after he allegedly pushed Martel into a mirror. He was released on his own recognizance and stabbed Martel on August 15. He also pleaded guilty on Tuesday to assaulting a man who tried to help Martel as Remy stabbed her.

A neighbor told police he tried unsuccessfully to pull Remy off Martel during the attack. Martel posted to her Facebook page the night she was killed, 'Jennifer Martel is in a complicated (Relationship),' according to court documents.

An independent review criticized prosecutors' handling of abuse allegations against Remy.

The
 case prompted questions about whether Remy's violent history had been 
overlooked by the criminal justice system. It led state lawmakers to 
propose an overhaul of the state's domestic violence laws, including new
 bail guidelines and tougher penalties for abusers.

Since
 Remy has been in jail, he has been accused of attacking another inmate,
 throwing hot coffee in his face, hitting him with a plastic chair and 
punching him. He is a former Red Sox security staffer who was fired by 
the team in 2008 during a steroid investigation.

Jared Remy in court today

Last week Ms Martel's parents 
spoke out for the first time to reveal that she was planning to escape 
her boyfriend just days before he stabbed her to death.

Patty
 and Brian Martel said they saw Remy becoming increasingly controlling 
of their daughter - demanding she take naps, dictating what time she was
 allowed to cook him dinner and calling her dozens of times throughout 
the day.

For
 years, they say,  their daughter rebuffed their suggestions that she should 
leave the relationship. She said her daughter needed her 
father. And she always seemed to see the good side of the Remy.

The Martels spoke to the Boston Globe
 - their first time ever speaking out about their daughter who was 
brutally attacked on the front lawn of her home in Waltham, 
Massaschusetts, on August 15, 2013 - just three days after Remy was 
arrested for battery for slamming her into a mirror in a fit 
of rage.

On
 Monday August 12, Mrs Martel said she talked to her daughter her the 
phone. After six years in an abusive relationship, Jennifer had finally 
had enough.

'She said, "Mom, don’t worry; I’m planning my escape,"' Mrs Martel told the Globe.

Mr and Mrs Martel said they always knew Remy was controlling. They said
 they could see him wearing down their 'effervescent' daughter - but 
they never knew how dangerous he could be.

'She used to always tell me, "Jared, he’s got a big bark, but he’ll calm down,"' Mrs Martel said.

Remy is the son of Jerry Remy, a popular Red Sox announcer

'We don’t come from violence. We didn’t recognize domestic violence. We just thought he was a jerk,' Mr Martel told the Globe.

In February
 2013, Mrs Martel - who lived in Virginia with her husband, her son 
Brian Jr and his wife and kids - drove to Massachusetts to visit her 
daughter. What she saw there upset her.

Remy,
 an alleged steroid abuser, called her 'trailer trash' and blew up at 
her over the smell of the cigarettes she smoked on the couple's patio.

One
 day, he declared that it was 'nap time' for Jennifer, Mrs Martel and 
little Arianna and made them lay down in a dark room for several hours.

When they were allowed to come out, he wouldn't let Jennifer cook dinner until he was ready to eat.

Mrs
 Martel said Remy became jealous any time Jennifer left the house 
without him - except for her work time and his scheduled visited to the 
gym.

She
 said she cut the visit to her daughter two days short when Remy became 
enraged with Jennifer. He called her 17 times in a row. By the time she 
picked up, she broke down in tears in a KMart as Remy screamed at her.

Jennifer told her mother she had to leave - that her presence was agitating her boyfriend.

Mrs Martel says she begged her daughter to take Arianna and come back to Virginia with her.

According to the Globe, Mrs Martel exchanged several tragic text messages with her daughter that day.

'Mom, don’t worry; I’m planning my escape.'

'I
 need to see [if] I can get him help first. I talk with his family to 
see what we can do. he is Ariannas father and I need to do this for 
her,' Jennifer wrote.

Her
 mother replied: 'I just want you to be happy you don’t deserve this 
Arianna loves him but as she [gets] older she going to see what he 
really is... Sometimes you can’t change someone like that ... He has a 
bad control on you.'

Jennifer
 said: 'I not going to let him control me. I have help here. jareds 
parents wants what is best for Arianna and they know jared is a mess.'

Later, she added: 'I cant handle another blowout like the other day. i am emotional exhausted.'

The
 next day, her brother, Brian Martel Jr. text Jennifer and said he would
 rent a UHaul and move her out of her home with Remy if she wanted. 
Again, Jennifer refused.

Brian
 and his wife got custody of Arianna after a lengthy court battle with 
Remy's father, Boston sports legend Jerry Remy. She will be raised with 
her cousins.

However, Jerry Remy and his wife have visitation rights.

Jared Remy's trial is set for October.
