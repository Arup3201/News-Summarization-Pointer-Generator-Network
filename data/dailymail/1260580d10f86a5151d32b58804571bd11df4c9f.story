Tragic: Police say Brittany Flannigan, a New Hampshire college student, died from an apparent overdose of the party drug Molly early Wednesday

Brittany's sister said Tuesday night's DJ Zedd concert was the first she had ever been to. She was a sosphomore at Plymouth State University in New Hampshire

The three overdoses happened at the House of Blues in Boston during a sold-out show for the popular DJ Zedd. He canceled his second show, scheduled for Wednesday night

Police told WBZ-TV that all three appear to have overdosed on Molly - a potent powder form of the party drug MDMA aka ecstasy.

Miss Flannigan's sister said the DJ Zedd show was the first concert she had ever attended.

The DJ, who was kicking off the world tour for his new album with a sold-out show, tweeted his sympathies after learning of the death of one of his fans.

'Love and respect to those in pain right now. Our hearts go out to you,' he said. 'PLEASE, everyone... BE RESPONSIBLE!'

Wednesday's Zedd show at the the House of Blues was canceled while police wrapped up their investigation there.

Miss Flannigan, from Derry, New Hampshire, was a sophomore at Plymouth State University in New Hampshire.

Miss Flannigan's friends described her as being from a 'good family'

Zedd, the German house music performer, tweeted out his sadness for the fans who overdosed and warned: 'Please, everyone: Be responsible!'

The House of Blues has been cited in the past for not preventing drug use both inside and outside the venue

Molly is a party drug that is growing rapidly in popularity - usually by fans at music festivals or electronica or house music concerts.

Molly is a powdered form of MDMA - or ecstasy - that is often much more pure and potent than the pill form of the drug.

It can be mixed with amphetamines or caffeine and is usually snorted or rubbed on the gums.

Effects can last three to six hours and can include enhanced feelings of emotional closeness and empathy.

The drug can also cause deadly side-effects and results in thousands of hospitalizations a year. 

MDMA can interfere with the users ability to regulate body temperature. In severe cases, this can cause liver and kidney failure and even heart attack and stroke. 

The drug has a significant comedown, which can produce feelings of depression as well as aches and pains for hours.

Scientific research has produced mixed results as to whether the drug is addictive, though some  users have reported that they became dependent on it.

'She was good, her parents were good people,' her friend Adam Cole told WBZ-TV.

The Boston Herald reports that an ER nurse that she found two pink pills the jeans pocket of the 24-year-old woman who was taken to the hospital. Doctors also found a baggie of white powder in her bra.

The man, who was described as being in his 20s, was said to be violently struggling with hospital staff.

Both of the surviving overdose victims are listed in stable condition.

Police say none of the partiers who overdosed knew each other. 

MDMA is popular at raves, music festivals and concerts for its reputed ability to make those who consume it feel euphoric and closer to the crowd and the musicians.

However, it can also have dangerous affects, including respiratory distress, heart failure and even stroke.

Live Nation, the concert promoter that owns House of Blues, issued a statement saying that 'safety is a top priory' for the company.

'One individual has unfortunately passed away and our thoughts go out to their family and friends for their loss. This matter is under investigation and we are continuing to working with local officials,' the statement read.

This is not the first time the House of Blues in Boston has had problems with its patrons using drugs at concerts, the Boston Globe reports.

In January 2010, the city Licensing Board cited the venue for not supervising fans standing in line outside who were inhaling nitrous oxide, another party drug, from balloons.

In April 2010, the venue was shut down for a day after inspectors found beer kegs blocking exits and performers smoking marijuana in the green room before going onstage.

The 23-year-old DJ Zedd, who performs electronic house music, was opening the world tour on his new album on Tuesday night
