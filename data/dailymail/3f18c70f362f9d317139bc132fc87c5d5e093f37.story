Philip Levine, a Pulitzer Prize-winning poet whose intimate portraits of blue-collar life were grounded in personal experience and political conscience - died at his Fresno, California home on Saturday, at age 87.

Former US poet laureate from 2011 to 2012, Levine passed away from pancreatic and liver cancer, his wife said Sunday.

He was among the country's most decorated poets, winning the Pulitzer in 1995 for The Simple Truth and the National Book Awards for the 1979 collection Ashes and for What Work Is.

Levine's other honors included the Ruth Lilly Poetry Prize for lifetime achievement and a National Book Critics Circle Award.

Philip Levine (pictured in 2006), a Pulitzer Prize-winning poet whose intimate portraits of blue-collar life were grounded in personal experience and political conscience, died at his California home on Saturday at age 87. 

While he taught in several colleges, Levine had little in common with the academic poets of his time, as he was not abstract, insular or digressive.

Levine captured the ways 'ordinary people are extraordinary,' while writing poems that are accessible to readers, said Edward Hirsch, a friend of Levine and president of the Guggenheim Foundation. 'They move between the most ordinary diction and high romantic heights.'

He added: 'We've lost a great presence in American poetry.' 

Born in Detroit in 1928 and the son of Russian Jewish immigrants, Levine was profoundly shaped by his working-class childhood and years spent working in jobs ranging from driving a truck to assembling parts at a Chevrolet plant.

As a poet, he consciously modeled himself after Walt Whitman, as he strove to be a writer of everyday experience and cosmic wonder.

This was evident in his tactile, conversational poems that focused on his childhood, living in Spain, marriage, parenting and poetry itself.

Levine was also a lover of the earth and sky as much as any poet of nature, but his poems explored the pangs of work and workers, such as Buying and Selling or Saturday Sweeping, in which employees toil under a leaky roof and 'blue hesitant light.' 

In What Work Is, the title piece of his celebrated 1991 collection, he offers a grim sketch of standing on line in the rain, hoping for a job:

This is about waiting,

shifting from one foot to another.

Feeling the light rain falling like mist

into your hair, blurring your vision

until you think you see your own brother

ahead of you, maybe ten places.

Levine's father, who was an auto-parts salesman, died when he was five years old. And although his mother found work as an office manager, he remembered his childhood as 'a succession of moves from first a house to a series of ever-shrinking apartments.'

As a kid, he was scrawny and imagined himself in peril on the streets of Detroit, 'the most anti-Semitic city west of Munich.' 

He would picture himself walking home from school with a rifle, shooting at Cadillacs, Lincolns and other cars owned by rich people.

By the end 1942, when he was 14, and had worked at a soap factory and, like a first kiss, he discovered poetry.

Levine became fond of it while attending Detroit's Central High School in 1945, after a teacher let him borrow a book by poet Wilfred Owen, according to the Detroit Free Press.

He would walk the streets late at night, speaking to the 'moon and stars about the emotional revolution that was raging' inside him.

Levine later attended Wayne State University, where he read the verse of Stephen Crane, T.S. Eliot and William Carlos Williams, and 'immersed' himself in the history of poetry.

'I believed even then that if I could transform my experience into poetry I would give it the value and dignity it did not begin to possess on its own,' he later observed.

The exhausting factory hours made Levine so determined to write that he showed up in 1953 at the University of Iowa's Writers Workshop even though a planned fellowship had fallen through. 

He was told he could sign up for one course, but he enrolled in three, and Poet John Berryman became his mentor.

'He seemed to feel I had something genuine,' Levine told The Paris Review in 1988, 'but that I wasn't doing enough with it, wasn't demanding enough from my work. He kept directing me to poetry that would raise my standards.'

Poet Yvor Winters allowed Levine to stay with him at his home in California and also selected him for a Stanford Writing Fellowship in 1958.

Around the same time, Levine joined the faculty of California State in Fresno and remained there for more than 30 years. He also taught at Princeton University and Columbia University among other colleges.

Levine was married twice, to Patty Kanterman and to Frances J. Artley, his wife since 1954. 

He is survived by Artley, his twin brother Edward and another brother Eli, his three sons, Mark, John and Teddy, five grandchildren and one great-grandchild, according to the New York Times. 

Levine's debut collection On the Edge came out in 1963, and other books included Not This Pig, They Feed the Lion and 1933. 

During a time in the 1960s, he spent time in Spain, and developed a deep bond to the country and to its people, especially those who had fought Francisco Franco during the country's civil war of the 1930s. 

He wrote poems about Spain and helped translate works by the Spanish poets Gloria Fuertes and James Sabines.

When he was back in the US, Levine was an opponent of the Vietnam War and defender of civil rights and the rights of working people. 

In Coming Home, Detroit 1968, he took in 'the charred faces' and 'eyes boarded up' of his hometown, which had been devastated by riots the year before. 

In 1968, he also was among the writers who vowed not to pay taxes until the Vietnam War ended.

'I can remember feeling full of the power of a just cause and believing that power would not fail me. It failed me or I failed it. We didn't really change the way Americans lived, unless you take hairstyles seriously,' he once said.

'I'm not a man of action; it finally comes down to that. I'm not so profoundly moral that I can often overcome my fears of prison or torture or exile or poverty. I'm a contemplative person who goes in the corner and writes.'
