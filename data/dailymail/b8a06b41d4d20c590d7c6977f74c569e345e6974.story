Keylor Navas is prepared to fight for his place at Real Madrid and wants to become their first-choice goalkeeper ahead of Iker Casillas.

Costa Rica international Navas has been with Madrid since August 2014 but has made just three appearances in La Liga as he plays second fiddle to Casillas.

Navas remains hopeful he can beat his team-mate to become the Spanish giant's No 1.

'I'm not somebody who just accepts his situation. I don't give up easily,' Navas told Spanish newspaper AS. 'I know the situation might not be what I wanted, but it's here that I need to bring out the best in myself, be stronger and commit myself completely like I have done up to now.

'It's not the first time I've been in this situation. I'm very relaxed, although it's true I want more.

'I know the path to follow to achieve results and I try to learn. I think that for me it's a privilege to be at Real Madrid and I try to show every day why they brought me to the club.'
