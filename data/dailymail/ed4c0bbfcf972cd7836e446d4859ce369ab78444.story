A Bulgarian man set himself on fire to protest against poverty in his country - becoming the sixth person to do so in the past month.

Proclaiming that he could no longer afford to even buy bread for his one child and that he 'could not stand it anymore' the unidentified man doused himself with petrol and 'tried to commit suicide', it has been reported.

The dramatic demonstrations have continued, despite an appeal by Bulgaria’s influential Orthodox Church that such desperate actions must stop.

They also have been part of nationwide protests about poverty that recently brought down the country’s government .

It comes as experts predict a surge in the number of Romanian and Bulgarian migrants who will head to the UK from next January when EU travel restrictions end, because of the dire economic situation in their own home countries.

Dr Daniela Kostadinova, head of the hospital where the victim was taken in critical condition, said on Wednesday morning, in the northern village of Sitovo, a 40-year-old unemployed man doused himself with petrol and tried to commit suicide.

The doctor told Bulgarian National radio the man could no longer afford to even buy bread for his one child and that he 'could not stand it anymore.'

Of the five other Bulgarian men who have set themselves on fire since February 19 for similar reasons, three of them have died and two remain in critical condition.

Economic growth has slowed to 0.8 percent, while unemployment has jumped to 12 percent this year. Six years after joining the EU, Bulgaria remains its poorest member.

Ordinary people find it hard to make ends meet, struggling to share their tiny salary for food, utility bills and other expenses. Many have accused public officials of corruption.

The dire economic situation plus the country’s status within the European Union has led many to predict that many will head to the UK when travel restrictions end next year.

Earlier this week, it was predicted that the number of Romanian and Bulgarian migrants who will head here from next January will be 12,700.

The total, compiled under the Labour government, was immediately rejected as ‘ridiculous’ by senior Coalition figures.

Communities Secretary Eric Pickles said the estimates, revealed yesterday after months of cover-up by ministers, were drawn up by Labour after comparing the two countries to Poland, which has sent around one million people to the UK.

The document predicts just 4,613 Bulgarians, out of a population of 7.5million, will come to Britain every year, along with 8,156 Romanians – a tiny fraction of its 21.4million inhabitants.

Bulgaria’s widespread anti-government protests have subsided since a new national election was scheduled for May 12.
