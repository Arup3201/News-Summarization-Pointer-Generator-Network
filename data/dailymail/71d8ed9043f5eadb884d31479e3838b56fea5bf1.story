Eighteen students and two staff taking part on an outdoors leadership trip to the Grand Canyon have been rescued by a helicopter after they became trapped by heavy snow. 

After five days of camping at Sowats Point to learn leadership skills, the group of 16 students, two graduate student assistants and two faculty members from Northern Arizona University realized the roads they had used to reach the campsite were covered by 18 to 34 inches of snow from a storm.

Their two vans, which only had two-wheel drive capabilities, became stuck in the snow and they called relatives and the university for help. Staff then contacted the Coconino County Sheriff's Office.

But because the helicopter could only carry three students at a time, the mission took 11 hours on Tuesday and the aircraft needed two re-fueling stops, NBC reported.

Flown to safety: This helicopter flew 18 college students and two staff members to safety on Tuesday after they became trapped in the Grand Canyon following a five-day camping trip

Stuck: When they tried to leave their camping site on Monday, their two vans became stuck in the snow

Covered: Authorities said between 18 and 24 inches of snow fell on the area during a snow storm on Monday

The students were flown  to Jacob Lake, where university vehicles were waiting to take them back to the campus, the sheriff's office said.

The group eventually returned to the campus at around 7.30pm on Tuesday - but the students said they were never worried for their safety. 

'It actually was just a wonderful experience,' student Maddie Petty told KPHO. 'These guys are just very prepared and they know what they're doing, so I never gave it a second thought really.' 

They were participating in the Parks and Recreation Management Outdoor Education and Leadership program at the time. 

Heading home: Over 11 hours on Tuesday, the students were flown in groups of three to waiting vans

Safe: The students can be seen arriving back at campus on Tuesday evening, but authorities said the group had been well-prepared for the weather and the students said they never feared for their safety

The university said the trip, which is led by wilderness experts, has been carried out for years, and that all members of the group were properly equipped for the weather.

They were also carrying a satellite phone, which they used to call for help. 

'Everyone's fine, they were in very good spirits,' said Tom Bauer, director of public affairs for the university. 'I'm hearing it was considered an adventure. These are people who like the outdoors.'

Gerry Blair, a sheriff's spokesman, told AZCentral that the rescue was just one of several search and rescue operations a week - but this one was different.

'It was nice that they were calm and knew what they were doing,' he said. 'This group was prepared.'

Breathtaking: An image from January shows the Grand Canyon covered in snow. More snow fell on the area on Monday, making it impossible for the Northern Arizona University group to drive on the dirt trails
