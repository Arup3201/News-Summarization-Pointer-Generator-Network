Rafa Benitez believes Liverpool must take positives from their impressive Premier League title challenge of last season in order to end their stuttering start to the 2014-15 campaign.

Brendan Rodgers' side have won just four of their opening 11 Premier League games, but Benitez hopes his former side can benefit from last season's success.

He told Sky Sports: 'When we finished second I was really pleased because we had 86 points and it still was not enough and everyone went ‘oh you lost an opportunity’.

Benitez won three major trophies during his time as Liverpool boss, including the Champions League

'So if you continue moaning about ‘oh we lost an opportunity’ you will not be ready for the future.

'So I think you have to concentrate on what you did well, what you did badly and then try to improve for the future, for the next one.'

The former Reds manager, currently in charge at Napoli, also refused to rule out a return to England, fuelling speculation that he could even make an Anfield comeback.

He added: 'My wife and two daughters live in Liverpool. It’s the first time I haven’t had them with me, it’s not easy. [Napoli owner Aurelio] De Laurentiis knows how important my family values are to me.'

'I want to win and do well this season and see where we are at the end.'
