Andy Murray appeared simply delighted on Christmas Day as he threw on a festive jumper for the seasonal celebrations.

The 27-year-old tennis star, who is almost as famous for his dry wit as his ability with a racket, took to Twitter to show off his new apparel.

'As you can see I'm chuffed to bits with my Christmas jumper #FireInTheBelly,' he tweeted.

Murray was enjoying a rare day off with his family at Christmas, and was showing off another new piece of attire earlier  - an Arsenal shirt with Alexis Sanchez on the back.

Brother Jamie, meanwhile, was given a Manchester United shirt to wear.

2014 has not been the best year for  Murray, as he failed to build on his previous successes and add to his US Open and Wimbledon titles in 2012 and 2013 respectively.

Murray was training earlier this month in Miami ahead of the Australian Open in January

He also dropped to a year-end ranking of No 6 in the world, and fell at the quarter-final hurdle of three of the four Grand Slams - only making the last-four of the French Open before losing in straight sets to Rafael Nadal. 

Murray's next aim will be the first major of 2015, the Australian Open which kicks off on January 19 in Melbourne.
