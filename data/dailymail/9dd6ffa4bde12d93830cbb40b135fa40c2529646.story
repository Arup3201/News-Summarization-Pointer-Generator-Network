A Japanese online retailer is branching out into bras, knickers and even silky nighties that, despite looking exactly like something you'd usually find in a woman's lingerie drawer, are actually intended for men.

The brand new line of pretty, floral bras and lacy knickers from fashion label Wish Room Men's, who sell their products on major Japanese web shopping mall Rakuten, are due to arrive in stores mid-February.

According to Japanese sites Pouch and RocketNews24, the garments aren't just women's smalls marketed towards men.

These bras, knickers and silky nighties, from Japanese retailer Wish Room Men's, are actually intended for men

The lingerie is specifically designed with men's larger frames in mind and, although they still feature the lace, florals and underwiring you might expect to find in a woman's underwear collection, the bra cups lack padding, allowing men to slip them on without feeling 'unnatural'.

Wish Room's say the line is designed to 
allow men the chance to 'enjoy the same kind of soft, luxurious 
undergarments that women are used to'.

Now one of its most popular items, Wish Room first launched men's underwear in 2008. The shop also stocks lingerie for women.

'I like this tight feeling. It feels good,' Wish Room representative Masayuki Tsuchiya told Reuters.

The company spokesman himself wears the bra, which can be worn discreetly under clothing.

In response, thousands debated the merits of men wearing bras on Mixi, Japan's top social network website

Executive Director Akiko Okunomiya said she was surprised at the number of men who were interested in embracing their feminine side in this way.

'I think more and more men are becoming interested in bras.

'Since
 we launched the men's bra, we've been getting feedback from customers 
saying, "Wow, we'd been waiting for this for such a long time",' she 
said.

Its festive range was a hit, but now the brand is moving into spring florals

The underwear 
stirred a heated debate online with more than 8,000 people debating the 
merits of men wearing bras in one night on Mixi, Japan's top social 
network website.

The bras and knickers come in pink and mint green sets, and retail for the surprisingly low price of £11.50 (1,995 yen). Prices go up to around £18.

With the exception of the adventurous 
few, indulging in a passion for pink, lacy lingerie has been the 
preserve of women. Until now.

One fashion firm hopes to change the way we shop for underwear with the launch of a range of racy lingerie exclusively for men.

The HommeMystere collection, which includes padded bras, lacy teddies and frilly thongs with names like Jungle Fever, Moulin Rouge and Forget-me-not, is said by the firm to be 'comfortable' and 'great for all day wear'.

They specialise in, they say, 'comfortable
men's panties that really do
fit, bra straps that don't fall off the shoulder, teddies that don't 
ride up halfway through the night and quality soft fabrics that feel 
great for all day wear'.

The
 Australian label - which has distributors in the UK and U.S. - say 
attractive undergarments feel great and make dressing more fun and 
enjoyable for men.

They say they understand that men want 'quality lingerie style underwear
 made with care, attention to detail' that fits your body perfectly'.

The Fun Teddy sleepsuit is a 'lovely soft fabric teddy for men' and a 'full cut that stays in place' priced £35.70
