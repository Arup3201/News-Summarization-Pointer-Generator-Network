A young couple were found dead in their car from carbon monoxide poisoning only one week before they were due to go on a romantic Bahamas couples cruise.

Brittany Holland, 25, and her boyfriend Casey Senechal, 26, died of carbon monoxide poisoning in the town of Lebanon, Connecticut.

The pair were found unresponsive in their parked, but running, vehicle, and according to police, they were not victims of any form of foul play.

Because of the evidence, the police have ruled the deaths has been ruled an accident.

Holland and Senechal both worked at the Union Street Market, and had only recently started dating.

Hollandâ€™s grandfather Bernard Bombardier told the Daily News: 'They were very much in love.

'Her and her boyfriend were out in the car, parked.

'I guess there was an exhaust leak.'

It is still unclear how the deadly colorless and odorless gas seeped into their vehicle.

Holland and Senechal, who had been dating for the past six months, were due to set sail to the Bahamas next week.

Holland posted a photo on her Facebook of the trip itinerary on March 2 with the caption 'Beyond excited!'

According to her grandfather, Holland was studying at Three Rivers Community College and was an aspiring nurse.

He said: 'She was a beautiful, kind, loving person.

'She was always happy. Always smiling.'

The couple's mutual friend Charlene Couchon was due to take the cruise with the new couple, but now the voyage will be a solo expedition.

She said: 'Eight days and I still have to go without her.

'It's going to be a very bittersweet situation.

I'm going to be extremely depressed and going to try to have as much fun as I can because we had so much planned for that trip.'
