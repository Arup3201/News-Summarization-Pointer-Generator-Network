Tuesday night's victory for the Republicans wasn't just a blow to President Barack Obama - it was also a knock on Hillary Clinton, who campaigned for almost all of the candidates who lost Democratic US Senate seats on Tuesday.

And Kentucky Senator Rand Paul, a likely challenger to Clinton in the 2016 presidential race, isn't letting her forget that she backed the wrong horses in 2014.

The Republican lawmaker posted several pictures on Wednesday of Clinton with losing Senate candidates and the message #HillarysLosers.

Paul is already trying to score points for the next election cycle by painting Tuesday night's losses as a reflection on Clinton's brand - even though she wasn't on the ballot in any state. 

Stepping up the pressure: Republican Senator Rand Paul is trying to paint Tuesday night's drubbing of the Democrats as a loss for Hillary Clinton, who campaigned for all the losers. Here, she is pictured with North Carolina Senator Kay Hagan, who lost by 1.7 percentage points

Hillary is seen here with Colorado Senator Mark Udall, who lost by a stunning four points on Tuesday night, despite early polls that gave him an enormous lead

Iowa Democrat Bruce Braley got trounced by eight and a half percentage points - despite Clinton's support during the election

'Today, voters sent a message to President Obama and Hillary Clinton, rejecting their policies and many of their candidates,' he said on social media.

In Kentucky, where self-proclaimed 'Clinton Democrat' Alison Lundergan Grimes unsuccessfully took on Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, the election was a 'referendum not only on the president, but on Hillary Clinton,' Paul told Fox News on Tuesday night.

The GOP seized control of the US Senate Tuesday night, picking up seven seats. Races in Alaska, Louisiana and Virginia, which have not been called, could give the Republicans a majority of up to 55.

After presiding over the loss of the US House in a wave election in 2010 and the loss of the Senate on Tuesday night, President Barack Obama is now a lame duck for the final two years of his presidency. 

Republicans ran on Obama's unpopularity and the dysfunction that has taken over Washington since he was elected. Democrats, meanwhile, largely ran away from the president and did everything they could to distance themselves from him.

Unlike Obama, though, candidates in tight races across the country asked Clinton to campaign for them in an attempt to energize voters. 

It didn't seem to work.

Lost and lost big: Despite enormous national resources, Alison Lundergan Grimes was thrashed by Senator Mitch McConnell in Kentucky - losing by more than 15percentage points

Paul told Breitbart News: 'Somebody should ask Hillary Democrats why they got wiped out tonight. Clearly, Hillary is yesterday's news.' 

Clinton has not formally announced that she will run for president again in 2016, but it has been widely reported that she still harbors ambitions for the White House. 

She leads any other potential 2016 candidates in polls. 

Politico has claimed today the Clinton will now be under increasing pressure from Democrats to declare whether she is running for president. She has previously said she would not talk about running for president until after January. 

The results from Tuesday election have already hurt one of Clinton's key 2016 pitches, Politico reports. Clinton had been planning to campaign for the early Iowa primary by declaring that Iowans had never voted for a woman in a statewide election. 

Iowa state Senator Joni Ernst won the US Senate seat by eight and a half percentage points on Tuesday - becoming the first woman elected statewide. She defeated Democratic US Congressman Bruce Braley - whom Clinton campaigned for. 

Not everyone Hillary backed lost. New Hampshire Senator Jeanne Shaheen defeated former Senator Scott Brown. Mary Landrieu, the Senator from Louisiana, came out barely ahead of her Republican challenger and now faces a runoff. 

She also campaigned with Wisconsin Senator Al Franken and Michigan Senator Gary Peters, who both won. 

Clinton also campaigned for Senator Jeanne Shaheen in New Hampshire (left), who won her race, and Louisiana Senator Mary Landrieu (right) - who faces a runoff after a tight campaign

In Georgia, Michelle Nunn, daughter of the former Democratic Senator, lost by by nearly eight percentage points - despite support from national Democrats
