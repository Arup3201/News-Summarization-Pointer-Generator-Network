Activists have asked authorities to let them know early if a white police officer will face charges for shooting dead black teenager Michael Brown, so they can try to stop violence when the news breaks.

Protests have rolled through the streets in the Missouri town of Ferguson since Brown was shot on August 9, as the killing became a flashpoint for race relations in the United States. While most of the demonstrations have been peaceful, rioting and looting have broken out occasionally.

The Don't Shoot Coalition on Wednesday asked for 48 hours' advance notice of a pending grand jury decision on whether Officer Darren Wilson will face charges for shooting Brown, saying it would help prevent widespread violence.

A makeshift shrine made of stuffed animal toys has emerged on the site where 18-year-old Michael Brown was shot dead by a Missouri police officer on August 9 in Ferguson, Missouri.

Members of the coalition said at a news conference they want to 'de-escalate violence without de-escalating action' once a grand jury decides whether to indict Officer Darren Wilson, who is white, for shooting Brown.

The coalition represents more than 50 organizations including union workers, clergy, anti-war activists and black empowerment groups. Its members are leaders of the protests that erupted across the region after Brown's death and have continued in the three months since.

'Everyone around the United States and much of the world is looking at St. Louis,' said Michael McPhearson, executive director of Veterans for Peace. 'There's much anticipation as to what happens next.'

Demonstrators on Wednesday criticized the use of tear gas, riot equipment and armored vehicles by county and local police in the early days of the protests. The heavy initial response led Gov. Jay Nixon to summon the National Guard and temporarily put the Missouri Highway Patrol in charge of Ferguson crowd control.

Anger at Brown's shooting erupted into violence protests in Ferguson in August, where marked demonstrators clashed with police firing tear gas and using armored vehicles 

At one point, the violence prompted Missouri Governor Jay Nixon to call out the National Guard and put the state highway patrol in charge of crowd control

Authorities were criticised for being heavy-handed in their initial response to the protests. The case has become a flashpoint for race relations in the United States

Ed Magee, a spokesman for St. Louis County Attorney Bob McCulloch, who is overseeing the grand jury investigation, met with McPhearson and attorney Denise Lieberman earlier Wednesday and said the coalition's request for 48 hours' notice of a grand jury decision is 'being considered.'

The grand jury was expected to hear evidence in Brown's case until mid-November, but McCulloch has said its work could continue for several more weeks.

Brown was unarmed when Officer Wilson encountered him walking in the street with a friend. A scuffle ensued and Brown was shot multiple times. Witness accounts of what happened varied.

Police have said Brown, who was 6ft 4ins and 300lbs, was killed after Wilson told the teenager and his friend to move out of the street and onto a sidewalk. They claim the victim was trying to go for Wilson's gun.

But witnesses, including the friend, told the press Brown had his hands up and was surrendering when he was gunned down.

'After the verdict, no matter what it is, people are going to pour into the street — either in celebration or in rage,' said Montague Simmons, chairman of the Organization for Black Struggle.

'It's in the best interest of the public, the police and elected officials who control the actions of the police to work together to protect the rights of people to engage in civil disobedience and expression of their First Amendment rights of free speech and assembly.'

Organizers have created 19 'rules of engagement' they want police to follow, including calls to treat protesters as 'citizens and not enemy combatants.'

County police Chief Jon Belmar said earlier this week police do not intend to impede peaceful dissent but said he wouldn't take anything off the table when asked about the use of tear gas and other tactics.

'I have a responsibility...to make sure that everybody walks out of this on the other end,' he said.

Brown's parents, Michael Brown Sr and Lesley McSpadden, have launched a campaign for justice and to improve race relations in the United States and elsewhere.

They are due to speak at a United Nations human rights conference in Switzerland next week.
