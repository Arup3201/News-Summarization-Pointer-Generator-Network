Police officers involved in the shooting of Mark Duggan, pictured, sat in a room together for eight hours to write their statements

Eleven members of the twelve man team which gunned down Mark Duggan sat in a room together to write their accounts of the shooting, a court heard.

But their boss denied that he feared this would have allowed them to ‘put their heads together’ and cover for the shooter.

Snaresbrook Crown Court heard that eleven of the CO19 officers who were at Ferry Lane, in Tottenham, on August 4 last year when Duggan was shot dead sat in a room together and took eight hours to write a full account of events.

Those called to give evidence in the trial of Kevin Hutchinson-Foster, accused of giving Duggan the gun, have admitted conferring on operational matters but deny discussing the actual shooting or their state of mind.

Before they made their first notes the team saw legal representatives and members of the police federation and were read the ACPO guidance on statements, which allows conferring on issues other than their 'honestly held belief' of the situation.

Stuart Denney QC, defending, quizzed Superintendent Neil Evans who was then the post incident manager at CO19 and called in after the shooting.

Mr Denney said: 'These police officers are friends and colleagues. Did it occur to you that in those circumstances if you put all 11 in a room they might not seek to ensure they protected their friend and colleague who had used the gun?'

Superintendent Evans replied: 'I did not see that then or now as a potential problem.'

When asked to clarify Mr Denney said: 'What I am suggesting is whether he thought about the possibility that officers might have put their heads together to help V53.'

Superintendent Evans replied: 'No, I did not think that.'

Mr Denney asked Colin Sparrow, the IPCC’s lead investigator in the case, whether the police making statements together was 'with a view to ensuring there were no unfortunate occurrences where two officers didn’t say the same thing.'

Mr Sparrow replied: 'Not at all. My concerns were that we got detailed initial accounts in order that I could then focus the investigation on challenging those accounts.'

No member of the IPCC was present at the statement writing because there were 'no resources' available, he said.

Paramedics attended to Duggan after he was shot by police

Hutchinson-Foster denies selling or transferring the BBM Bruni Model 92 handgun to Duggan.

The court also heart from Kevin Hutchinson-Foster, the man accused of giving him a pistol told police.

He said Mark Duggan’s death was 'karma' because 'you live by the gun, you die by the bullet'.  Hutchinson-Foster, 30, who is alleged to have given Duggan the gun shortly before he was shot by police, said he was attacked by a gang including Duggan the month before his death.

Referring to Duggan’s death, he told police in interview: 'They say karma is a bitch.'

Duggan, 29, was shot twice by a police marksman as he ran from a taxi he had been travelling in and pulled a gun from his waistband and started to aim it at cops, the CO19 team who gunned him down have claimed.

A BBM Bruni Model 92 handgun, wrapped in a sock, was found roughly five metres from Duggan’s body in Ferry Lane, Tottenham, the court has heard.

His death August 4 last year sparked the riots in Tottenham which rocked the nation.

Hutchinson-Foster, 30, was arrested in October after forensic tests linked him to the pistol Duggan was allegedly holding when he was killed.

Hutchinson-Foster is said to have handed the weapon hidden in a shoe box to Duggan outside his girlfriend Desire Cox’s home in Leyton, east London just 15 minutes before he was gunned down.

When he was arrested Hutchinson-Foster told police that he had bled on a gun he was beaten with when ten gang members, including Mark Duggan, attacked him as he was on his way to meet a girl on their patch, a court heard today.

Superintendent Neil Evans who was then the post incident manager said he did not think the officers put their heads together when recalling the events, Snaresbrook Crown Court, pictured, heard

He told police in interview he recognised one of the men but said he didn’t want to name him for fear of reprisals.

He said: 'At the same time, like I said, a lot of stuff has happened since then, and they say that karma is a bitch.

'They say you live by the gun and you die by the bullet. So you know from what I have heard if it is the person who did whatever to me then he is not living anymore, I am taking about June, July, August still.'

He added: 'If I say something now and the wrong set of people hear about it I would rather be in prison than out here with people wanting to do me something.'

He told police that he had family in Hackney and Tottenham and he didn’t want to be 'wandering around scared'.

But once he was reassured the interview was private he said 'a lot of things have happened because of, this you know, his name is Mark'.

He confirmed that it was Duggan and said that they knew some of the same people and that he had been sleeping with the same South African woman as the father-of-four.

He told the officers that members of the Holly Street And London Fields gang did not like him because he had been sleeping with their 'baby mama'.

Then, days after the birth of his daughter, Hutchinson-Foster, a self proclaimed womaniser who said he sometimes sleeps with four women a day, was on his way to see a girl in the Holly Street Estate when he was attacked by the gang including Duggan.

Hutchinson-Foster said he was 'not used to seeing (Duggan) in that neck of the woods'.

In his interview, read to the jury at Snaresbrook Crown Court today, he said: 'I got battered by about eight or 10 boys.'

The shooting of Mark Duggan was the catalyst for some of the worst riots in UK living history

Pockets of rioting and looting broke out in various boroughs of London, and other English cities following the shooting of Mark Duggan

He said: 'I will be honest, I thought I was going to get shot, just like today all those guns butting my face. I just heard them say “burn him”. I just curled up and hoped for the best.'

He said he was scared of reprisal, telling police: 'I don’t want to be constantly looking over my shoulder, I got a three month old girl.'

When he was first arrested he complained: 'If someone hits me with something and I bleed on it I get into trouble.'

But his claims in interview about the attack were proven to be 'lies', the prosecution have said.

He has since pleaded guilty to possessing the firearm with intent to cause fear of violence and assaulting Hackney barber Peter Osadebay causing him actual bodily harm on July 29.

The pistol-whipping attack, which linked him forensically to the gun, was after he said he was attacked by Duggan and the gang.

He denies selling or transferring the prohibited firearm to Duggan.

The trial continues.
