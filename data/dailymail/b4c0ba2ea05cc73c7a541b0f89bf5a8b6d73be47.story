Four-year-old Caleb Wallace, who died after falling from the window of a block of flats in Pollokshields, Glasgow

A four-year-old boy who died after falling from the top-floor window of a block of flats has been named as Caleb Wallace, police said.

Caleb plunged from the third floor of a building in Pollokshields, Glasgow, at about 10.20am yesterday.

He was rushed to the Royal Hospital for Sick Children in Yorkhill but Strathclyde Police said he died a short time after arriving.

Neighbour Alan McCann, 44, spoke of 
the horrifying moment he discovered the boy lying on the ground having 
fallen from the top-floor window.

He
 said: 'I was walking nearby and I heard one of my neighbours, who saw 
it happen, screaming. I ran round to the front of the building and I saw
 the wee man lying there.

'I put him in the recovery position and phoned the ambulance straight away. I waited with the boy for ten minutes.

'I
 was rubbing his hands and his ears but he was in a bad way. I put a 
blanket over him. The paramedics were talking to me on the phone and 
told me to check his breathing but I didn't want to touch his wee body.

'My neighbour, is too upset to speak.
 I can't get it out of my head now. It's a tragic day. God bless him. He
 was only four years old. It's absolutely tragic.'

Karen Cowan, 52, who lives across the street from the block of flats, said yesterday: 'I heard about it this morning.

'I see his mum walking to the shops now and again. I can't imagine what she is going through. It's shocking.'

Another neighbour, who did not wish to be named, said: 'He had no chance falling from the top floor. It's terrible.

Residents near the block of flats in Pollokshields spoke of their shock at the child's death

'A few years ago another wee boy fell out of a window in the same block but around the back. He pulled through but he only fell from the second floor.'

Strathclyde police is investigating the incident, which happened in St Andrew's Drive. A report will be sent to the procurator fiscal.

Speaking yesterday, Norman MacLeod, SNP councillor for the Pollokshields ward, said: 'This is distressing news of a young boy in my ward, of only four years of age, having lost his life this morning, apparently after falling from a window.

'Clearly the proper authorities will 
require to undertake a full investigation into all the circumstances 
surrounding this incident but, in the meantime, I hasten to extend my 
most profound and heartfelt sympathy and condolences to the family, 
friends and relatives of the youngster whose life so tragically has been
 lost.

'They all will be in my prayers at this most sad time.'

Scottish Conservative councillor for the area, David Meikle, said: 'I'm shocked and saddened to hear about the tragic death of a young boy falling from a block of flats in Pollokshields.

'My thoughts go out to the family who have lost a child.

'There needs to be a full investigation into this incident so we can get to the bottom of what happened and ensure nothing like this happens again.'
