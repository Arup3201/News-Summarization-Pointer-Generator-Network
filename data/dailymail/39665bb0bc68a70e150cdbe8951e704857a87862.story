Zlatan Ibrahimovic wanted to join Real Madrid after leaving Barcelona because it would have been the 'perfect revenge' on Pep Guardiola, his agent has revealed.

The Swedish striker, now plying his trade for Paris Saint-Germain in France, left Jose Mourinho's Inter Milan for Barcelona in 2009, but lasted just one season  after falling out with Guardiola.

Now, Ibrahimovic's agent Mino Raiola has spoken openly about the Swede's difficult relationship with his former manager - a man he has openly called a 'coward' in the past.

'Zlatan wanted to play for Real [Madrid] when he left Barcelona,' Raiola told Spanish newspaper Marca. 'It would have been the ideal move; the perfect revenge against Guardiola.

'As a person, Guardiola's behaviour was terrible, shocking. He's a great coach. [He called Zlatan] about 10 times [in the year he was at Barcelona]. He told him whatever he needed or wanted, he would be helped with. Then all of a sudden, he stopped talking to him.'

Ibrahimovic - who is the most expensive footballer of all time in combined transfer fees - has previously alleged that Lionel Messi, his former team-mate at Barcelona, had been unhappy with the impact Ibrahimovic made at the Nou Camp.

In fact, according to the Swede, Messi complained to Barcelona because, 'I scored more goals than him.'

Raiola admits that he doesn't know if Ibrahimovic's problems were solely down to Messi's status at the club, but told a story involving then Barcelona director of football Txiki Begiristain. 

'I remember Txiki Begiristain called me in November and told me he wanted to talk with me: "Look, Messi is upset, he's not happy. He's not scoring many goals and Zlatan has to help him."

'Ibra said it was fine and agreed. One month later Txiki told me Guardiola was going to change the system in spite of him not agreeing. "No problem," I told him. Txiki then tells me there's a problem: "Messi was upset and went crying to Guardiola and he's going to play through the middle and Guardiola's not going to play two strikers."

'Pep didn't speak to Zlatan again, not even when he was injured.'

Despite eventually joining AC Milan on loan, before moving on a permanent deal, Ibrahimovic's desire when leaving Barcelona was to join their rivals Real Madrid, where he could then exact revenge on Guardiola.

'[Ibrahimovic] was more professional than ever and wanted to sign for Real Madrid,' Raiola added, 'but they didn't have the balls at the Bernabeu and no clear plan.'

Instead, he went to AC Milan, before joining Paris Saint-Germain in the summer of 2012. He has impressed in the French capital, but his agent has a clear message when it comes to his future. The Parc des Princes may not be his home when he hangs up his boots.

'I don't think Ibra will finish his career at PSG.'
