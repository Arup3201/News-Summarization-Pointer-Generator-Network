Actress Brenda Blethyn - the daughter of a chauffeur and a maid - has criticised Downton Abbey for glamorising the life of domestic servants.

The Bafta-winning star said she knew the real poverty of those 'below stairs', as the youngest of nine children born to a couple who were both servants.

The 68-year-old told the Radio Times: 'We had sod all. One cold tap in the house.

'No heating. Gas mantles for 
light.

Actress Brenda Blethyn (pictured in ITV's Vera) - the daughter of a chauffeur and a maid - has criticised Downton Abbey for glamorising the life of domestic servants

'Do you know what a gas mantle is? I’ll draw you one. But everyone
 was in the same boat, on our street anyway.'

She admitted that she loved the show but that it had been a 'bit glamorised', adding: 'you don’t see how cold it is in the kitchen.'

Ms Blethyn also decried the way technology was affecting communication and admitted that she never sent text messages as she 'refuses to abbreviate.'

Ms Blethyn divorced her husband Alan in 1973 after he 'fell in love with another woman', but kept his name.

The youngest of nine children, her mother and father met in service in Broadstairs in Kent and were together for more than 60 years. 

The ITV drama Downton Abbey has been a runaway success since it hit screens four years ago.

The ITV  drama has been a runaway success since it hit screens four years ago, with Hollywood a listers among its fans

It has been a smash with Hollywood A-Listers - with fans including Rapper Sean Combs, also known as Puff Daddy, and Whoopi Goldberg - and it is watched by 120 million viewers in 220 countries.

In last year’s Commons debate on the Budget, Ed Miliband used the show to mock the privileged backgrounds of David Cameron and his Cabinet colleagues by saying: ‘We all think it’s a costume drama. They think it’s a fly-on-the wall documentary.’
