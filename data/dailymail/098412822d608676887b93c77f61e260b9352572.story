Defence: Ashley Gill-Webb, 34, from South Millford, Leeds, was 'mentally unwell' at the time of the bottle-throwing incident, his legal team have claimed

A father of two who hurled a bottle onto the track moments before Usain Bolt’s iconic 100m Olympic victory was 'mentally unwell' at the time, his legal team have claimed.

Ashley Gill-Webb, 34, is accused of barging to the front of the stadium and hurling a barrage of abuse before throwing the green, plastic bottle at the sprinters.

Gill-Webb, from South Millford, Leeds, was due to stand trial over the incident in September after pleading not guilty to using threatening words or behaviour with intent.

However, this was later abandoned after he was sectioned under the mental health act.

An alternative charge was added during the hearing at Thames Magistrates' Court today which alleges that Gill-Webb did cause the 
distress but without the intent. He indicated a not 
guilty plea.

District Judge Jacqueline Comyns agreed to put Gill-Webb's trial off until January to give the defence time to gather  psychiatric report.

She said: 'He (Gill-Webb) is admitting that he did the act but 
it is a question of whether he was aware of what is in the charge or 
whether he intended it in the other charge.'

'All it comes down to in effect is whether he knew what he was doing.'

The judge also warned: 'I am not having this trial vacated, if he is not ready then that is unfortunate.'

Gill-Webb, who was banned from all Olympic 
venues after the incident, is still receiving mental health treatment at the Bootham Park Hospital, in York, the court heard.

Today, wearing a black suit with white shirt and blue tie, he sat blinking and looking nervously around the courtroom during the short hearing.

Defending, Thomas Barley said: 'The trial issue is essentially at the time of the offence Mr Gill-Webb’s mental state.'

'It seems now that this is plainly to be a case where the actual physical behaviour of Mr Gill-Webb isn’t going to be in dispute, the defence are not going to be asking for any prosecution witnesses to be called.'

As it happened: The green bottle can be seen bouncing next to Jamaica's Yohan Blake (third left) in this picture of the 100m Olympic sprint from August 5

Intervention: Dutch World Judo champion Edith Bosch, who intervened during the stadium incident, will no longer have to travel from Amsterdam to give evidence against Gill-Webb

This means that Dutch World Judo 
champion Edith Bosch, who intervened during the stadium incident, will 
no longer have to travel from Amsterdam to give evidence against him.

Bosch
has described how she was standing close by when a green plastic drink 
bottle was thrown from the stands behind the start line.

The 32-year-old judoka tweeted at the time: 'A drunken spectator threw a bottle onto the track! I HAVE BEATEN HIM... unbelievable.'

Explaining the message, she later described how she saw a man who was having 'behaviour problems' and 'pushed him away hard'.

'I did like any other person would have done, I corrected it. I just said, "Man, you’re crazy, what are you doing?",' she said.

'We are here for Olympic heroes, people who are performing on the highest level, and we have to honour them, not disrespect them.'

She added: 'The one thing I’m most sad about is, due to all the commotion, due to this guy, I missed out on the 100m.'

Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt, who won the race in 9.63 seconds, said he had been unaware of the incident.

U.S. sprinter Justin Gatlin, who took bronze, said: 'It was a little distraction and I didn’t know what it was. But when you’re in those blocks and the whole stadium’s quiet, you can hear a pin drop.'

He said the incident had not affected the race: 'You just have to block it out and go out there and do what you got to do.'

And Jamaican sprinter Yohan Blake said: 'I was so focused I didn’t see anything. I was so focused on just running to the line.'

Gill-Webb was bailed to live at his home address or the hospital, and a condition not to enter any Olympic venues was removed.

Unfazed: Usain Bolt, left, who won the 100m race, said he had not noticed the bottle, while his countryman Yohan Blake, right, said he was 'so focused' on the finish line he hadn't seen the bottle either
