Catina, Jalen and Aaliyah are among the most popular baby names from the twentieth century - and they are all based on well-known personalities of their time.

A new study has revealed the 10 girls and boys names that saw the biggest spikes in the 1900s, and through-out the years it was always star sportsmen, famous actors and actresses and even military chiefs who captured the imagination of parents.

In 1937, the most trendy name given to baby girls was Deanna. At that time Deanna Durbin was an actress who often played the model daughter in films and TV shows.

Looking back on 2013, data may reveal a 
huge spike in certain unusual names. Perhaps Barack,Â  Beyonce, or even 
Snooki may briefly flare in popularity before returning to obscurity.

Flowing Data used the Social Security Administration's data to track the trendiest names of the past century, and the results are interesting in that they can almost always be directly linked to events or popular culture of the time.

There are always 'regular' names, such as Sophia, Matthew, Mary or John, that maintain a certain level of use. It's the more unusual names that go from nothing to hugely popular and back again that Flowing Data is interested in.

'If a small percentage of the baby population was given a name one year and a relatively much higher percentage of the next year's baby population got said name, we consider that a trendy name,' according to Flowing Data.

The website used a mathematical equation to find out which names had the highest 'relative risk' - the probability of a name being used that generally has a low likelihood statistically.

Many of the names that proved the most trendy can be easily linked to contemporary events.

The number one most trendy girl name was Catina, which reached its peak in 1972, when a character in the popular soap Where the Heart is gave birth to a baby girl and named her Katina.

The name Dustin spiked in 1967, the year Dustin Hoffman starred in the film The Graduate. The name Dawson reached its high the year the hugely popular Dawson's Creek debuted on television.

Many baby girls were named Aja in 1978, the year the Steely Dan album Aja came out.

And Yulissa spiked in 1997, another soap opera name from the Mexican telenovela Te Sigo Amando.

There was a jump in boys with the unusual name of Woodrow in 1913, the year Woodrow Wilson was elected President.

Other names aren't as easy to place.

In 2005, there was a spike in baby boys who were named Talan, which Flowing Data tentatively puts down to Talan Torriero, a 'star' of the reality television show Laguna Beach.

The popularity of the name Deneen rose in 1964, but the analyst of the data couldn't put forth a candidate from whom the name might have gained it popularity.

Flowing Data also noted a trend for uniqueness in the past few decades, meaning people are using more unique names than ever before.
