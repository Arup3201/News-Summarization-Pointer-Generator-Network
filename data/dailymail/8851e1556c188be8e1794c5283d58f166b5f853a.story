Children at risk of asthma attacks are to have access to emergency inhalers at their schools for the first time.

Regulations banning schools from holding inhalers as they contain the prescription drug salbutamol are to be updated.

Around 20 school age children die from asthma every year in England and Wales.

Children will have access to emergency inhalers at school for the first time under the change in law (posed by model)

Campaigners say two thirds of children with asthma have had an asthma attack whilst they’ve been at school.

Surveys show almost nine out of 10 children say they have been without their own inhaler because they have forgotten, lost, broken or it has run out.

If a child with symptoms of out-of-control asthma does not have access to a blue ‘reliever’ inhaler, teachers may have to urgently contact a doctor or call 999.

But from next month schools will be allowed to hold an asthma inhaler in their first aid kit for emergencies.

The UK has one of the highest rates of childhood asthma symptoms in the world.

Kay Boycott, Chief Executive of Asthma UK, said the charity has been campaigning for a change in regulations.

She said ‘One in 11 children in the UK has asthma, the most common long term condition in childhood and more than two thirds of children with asthma have told us they have had an asthma attack whilst they’ve been at school.

Jeremy Hunt welcomed the change as a 'common sense step forward' 

‘Tragically the equivalent of a classroom of children still die from asthma every year, this simply has to stop.

‘Following a long fought campaign by Asthma UK, schools will be able to legally keep spare emergency inhalers to keep children with asthma safe at school from 1 October.

‘This will not only give reassurance to millions of parents across the UK but it is also vital for the two children in every classroom with asthma to reduce their risk of having a potentially life threatening asthma attack at school.’

The charity’s advice to teachers and other school staff helping a child or young person having an asthma attack is to let them take two puffs of reliever inhaler immediately. 

In future, schools will be able to get a supply of a small amount of inhalers and a spacer – for ease of use in emergencies – from a local pharmacy using a signed form from the Head Teacher.

If a school has more than one site they can get inhalers to cover them all.

Any change in the legislation would not make the holding of an inhaler mandatory but give schools the option.

Secretary of State for Health Jeremy Hunt said ‘Children with asthma, and their parents, should not have to worry about suffering an asthma attack without having the necessary medication - and this common-sense change is an important step forward.’
