This is the moment a huge Bengal tiger made off with a woman's handbag after she accidentally dropped it into his enclosure at a Chinese zoo. 

Li Qin Hao was using her shiny brown patent leather bag to try and get the big cat's attention at Shanghai Zoo when it slipped from her grasp and ended up in a pool of water inside the animal's pen.

Aware that all her money, credit cards and keys were in the bag, Ms Li initially planned to wait until it was safe and then reach over and grab it.

But the tiger had different ideas - taking such a shine to the accessory that he swam the length of the water to pick it up, before carrying the bag back to a difficult-to-access island in the middle of his enclosure and parading around with it in his mouth.

Fortunately staff at Shanghai Zoo were understanding about the situation and gave Ms Li and her family a free pass to spend the rest of the day at the attraction while they worked hard to distract the tiger for long enough to recover the handbag and all the essential items it was carrying. 

'We waited until the tiger was being fed in another part of the enclosure and a member of staff retrieved the bag. It was a bit chewed and soggy but it was all there,' said Shanghai Zoo's manager He Ch'in. 

Images of the tiger stealing the handbag have swept across Chinese social media, with Ms Li saying: 'My children and everyone else thought it was hilarious and even I had to see the funny side in the end.'
