Basketball star LeBron James had a shock recently when he was carded at a hotel bar on Friday night in Orlando, Florida.

The 29-year-old Miami Heat basketball player was in the city to watch the Orange Bowl when the incident happened.

A sports writer for the Bleacher Report tweeted about the incident on Saturday, which has since gone viral on social media.

Surprised: The Miami Heats star, seen here with Savannah Brinson in October last year, reportedly laughed at the request

Ethan Skolnick tweeted: ‘Now that he talked about it, I’ll tweet it: strangest thing I’ve seen was LeBron getting carded at hotel bar last nt. Bartender was serious.’

One person commented on the tweet, asking if LeBron reacted in a ‘posh’ way or ‘just laughed at it’, to which Skolnick responded that he had simply laughed.

It is not apparent whether the bartender did not recognise the celebrity basketball player, or whether he was simply ‘doing his job’.

According to the Miami Herald, LeBron didn’t tell the employee who he was but was surprised to be carded. ‘Look at my beard!’ he said.
