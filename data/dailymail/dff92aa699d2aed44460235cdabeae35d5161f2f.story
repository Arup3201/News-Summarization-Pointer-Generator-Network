The teen son of Ted Kennedy Jr casually ate dinner with a stranger who broke into his family's Cape Cod compound Tuesday night because he thought he was a friend of his father.

Trespasser James Lacroix, 53, was arrested at the family's seaside estate when Kennedy Jr called to check up on 16-year-old son Edward Kennedy III and the stranger answered the phone instead.

Lacroix made his first court appearance on Wednesday, wearing the same Captain America shirt he was arrested in. His arraignment has been pushed back until August 13, as he undergoes psychological evaluation.Â

'Normal enough': The 16-year-old son of Edward M Kennedy Jr first came across Lacroix at the home, but didn't call police because he assumed the middle-aged man was a friend of the family

Though Edward had never met Lacroix before, he wasn't alarmed to see the strange man in the compound when he came home Wednesday evening.

'He looked normal enough and he mentioned he knew my dad,' Edward told police. He also called the unexpected guest 'interesting'.

Dynasty: Ted Kennedy Jr is the nephew of assassinated President John F Kennedy

Police explained that since the home is shared by the large family, many visitors are often invited to the estate, so Edward was not alarmed when he saw someone he did not know.

So unfazed was the 16-year-old, that 
he even shared a tortellini dinner with the stranger, and Lacroix politely washed
 the dishes after their meal.

Edward then took a shower and went out to meet friends, leaving Lacroix in the home alone.

Around 9:30pm, Kennedy Jr called the house to check up on his son but Lacroix answered instead, giving his full name.

That's
 when the elder Kennedy called police to report the intruder. He also 
called his son to say that Lacroix was never invited into the home and 
that he should stay away from the compound until his mother arrived from
 Boston.

Police found Lacroix peacefully reading a book in the home and said he appeared to be 'detached from reality'

'(Police) asked him what he was doing at the house he said he
 was looking for Katy Perry and JFK, and looking to give Katy a gift,' 
said Barnstable police Sgt. Michael Riley. 'It was pretty clear he was 
detached from reality.'

He also claimed he was a war veteran and disabled.

Neighbors
 in the small village community told police they saw the man pull into 
the driveway in a black Corvette about three hours earlier.

Estate: The compound has been in the Kennedy family for almost 90 years and includes three large homes. Above, an Honor Guard carries the casket of the late Ted Kennedy across the porch of his home on the compound in 2009

It is believed he may have got inside through an unlocked door.

He was arrested on suspicion of breaking and entering by the Barnstable Police and reportedly asked to speak with the Kennedy's themselves according to the news channel WDHD.

At the time, Lacroix was out on bail from Flamouth District Court for violating a restraining order against his ex-wife.

In court on Wednesday, a court psychologist told the judge that Lacroix appeared to be having delusions and told her he had been treated for a psychotic disorder.

His attorney, penelope Psomos, said Lacroix did not make any threats on the Kennedy home The judge agreed that he did not appear dangerous but ordered him to stay away from the compound.

Unusual request: Officers said the man asked after the pop sensation, seen performing last week in New York

The compound on Cape Cod has been in the Kennedy family for almost 90 years and includes three large homes on six acres of land.

John F Kennedy's father, Joseph P Kennedy, bought a summer cottage near the plot in 1928.

The home at which the intruder was found, in Irving Avenue, was bought in 1956. it was assessed this year at $2.11million, according to town records.

It was used as a base for John F Kennedy's 1960 Presidential campaign and later as a retreat, where he enjoyed spending time with his family until he was assassinated in 1963. It is now owned by a family trust

It was also a favored home of Ted Jr's father, Senator Ted Kennedy, before his death in 2009.

Healthcare lawyer Ted Jr revealed in April that he had finally given into pressure to join the family firm and would make a bid for political office in the Connecticut state senate.
