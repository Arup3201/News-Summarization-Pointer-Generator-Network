Julian Assange has found a way to escape asylum in the Ecuadorian Embassy, and preach his causes, without getting arrested by British authorities. 

The infamous founder of WikiLeaks used hologram technology to appear on Sunday for a speech at The Nantucket Project, a Massachusetts conference similar to TED talks.

The 43-year-old Australian native has been able to speak at several events from his self-imposed house arrest thanks to Skype, but Sunday marked the first time he has appeared as a hologram.

The hologram event was organised from inside the Ecuadorian Embassy by London-based British billionaire Alki David, whose company Hologram USA owns the technology which made the transmission possible. 

Documentary filmmaker Eugene Jarecki interviewed Assange at the project, which also saw Secretary of State John Kerry, former Secretary of the Treasury Larry Summers and poet Billy Collins this weekend.

Futuristic: Julian Assange appeared via hologram to give a talk at the Nantucket Project on Sunday. The 43-year-old founder of Wikileaks has been living in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London since 2012 

Assange talked about life in asylum, which makes it difficult to do his work finding sources willing to divulge documents.

Assange has been living in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London since 2012, when the UK decided to extradite him to Sweden where he is wanted on charges of sexual assault. 

He went on to slam Google's privacy policies, promote his new book, and defend his stance to release the Chelsea Manning papers four years ago.

As for the Chelsea Manning leaks, Assange says he doesn't regret publishing them on WikiLeaks, even though they compromised American military secrets.

He says he expected 'a hard time for maybe five to seven years' but felt the good in publishing the papers outweighed the negatives.

Assange's book 'When Google Met WikiLeaks' is set to hit book stands this week, at the same time as 'How Google Works' - a book penned by Google executive chairman Eric Schmidt. 

'If you see Eric Schmidt’s book, the cover of it is remarkably similar to the cover of this book,' Assange said, holding up a hologram of his book. 'So similar that I’m not sure the timing was a coincidence in publication.' 

The two have been engaged in a back and forth public debate, with Assange this past week calling Schmidt's Google a 'privatized NSA'. 

The Google exec responded by calling Assange 'paranoid'. 

Assange said that Google tries to pass itself off as a company run by 'fluffy graduate students' or rather 'not even a company at all, but something that gives free services'. 

He argued that Google is a normal company that needs to be viewed and held to the same standards as such. 

However, he says Google is more than a normal company in the sense that it tries to 'collect as much information about the world as is possible, store it, index it, make predictive models about people’s interests, and use that to sell advertising.' 

Assange ended the interview by giving moderator Jarecki a hologram high-five.
