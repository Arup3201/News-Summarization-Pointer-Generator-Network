They both left Atletico Madrid to become one of the Premier League's leading goalscorers, but that isn't all Sergio Aguero and Fernando Torres have in common.

The two strikers also have a tattoo of their name in the Elvish language created by J R R Tolkein in his Lord of the Rings books.

Manchester City forward Aguero has revealed that his ink was inspired by Torres, after the former Liverpool star saw the films and decided to get a tattoo done.

The Argentina striker was inspired to get a tattoo in Elvish by former Chelsea forward Fernando Torres

'It’s written in Elvish,' Aguero told Manchester City's website. 'That’s what the guy who did the tattoo said to me. He saw it in "Lord of the Rings".'

'I was 18, I wanted a tattoo but wasn’t sure about what. He asked me what I wanted but I really didn’t know. I wanted something I would never regret. 

'I thought about my mum or dad names of my family initials. So I started looking for something but didn’t get it right.

'So when I found out Torres had his name written in Elvish suggested checking how Aguero would look. I didn’t like that either but then we added Kun and I got it done.'

Aguero, who has his son's name tattooed on his other arm, insists that, despite few people understanding the design, he does not regret it eight years on. 

'I am never going to regret it. It’s my own name. You know, at that age you may get a tattoo and then a few years later you end up think ‘Why did I get this tattoo!’ But to be honest, it looks great and nobody can understand it!'
