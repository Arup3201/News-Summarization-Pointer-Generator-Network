He was recently slammed for an 'excruciating' and 'sexist' advert which saw him compare women to luxury cars.

But now former England footballer Michael Owen is back with a 'staggeringly boring' advert for Spey whisky which has been branded the 'worst ever made' and 'agony to watch'.

In his trademark monotone, the striker claims he always celebrates his wins with Spey whisky and encourages others to keep the secret by turning to the camera and uttering a toe-curling 'shhh'.

The advert opens with the former Liverpool player looking through photographs of the glory days before saying: 'Playing as a striker I was relentless in my pursuit for explosive force and speed.

Former England footballer Michael Owen has been lampooned for a new advert for Spey whisky which sees him turn to the camera and say 'keep the secret, shhh'

'Now I'm enjoying a different milestone in life. I've learnt the beauty of slowing down and to savour it all minute by minute.'

Owen was chosen to act as a 'Trojan horse' for whisky producer Speyside Distillers so their product could reach the Chinese market due to his popularity in the country.

But the company's first advert intended for the Chinese audience has been deemed 'agony to watch' by UK viewers.

The 30-second clip sees the footballer, clad in a top hat and smart suit, leading a horse out onto the racetrack.

He then says: 'Every time I step into the ring, the spirit of the warrior courses through me. Together, we bolt through the ring with vigorous sensations of speed.

'My passion in life is thoroughbred horse racing – I always celebrate my wins with Spey whisky.'

Both adverts culminate with the former footballer asking viewers to 'keep the secret'.

But hundreds have taken to Twitter to lampoon the star for yet another embarrassing advert.

Several referred to the fact that he had been on a voice coaching course last year, but said it had made no difference.  

Ruaridh Aitken said: 'Awful Spey whisky vid advert, dn't giv up the day job, actually please giv up the commentating to rofl (sic) #MichaelOwen.'

Michael Noone tweeted: 'This is just so painful... Michael @themichaelowen please don't act again.'

John Gold said: 'Michael Owen doing a whiskey advert is the most awkward 30 seconds of video I've seen for a while.'

Spey launched its no-age-statement Spey Whisky Michael Owen 1412 in Taiwan in December last year to mark the star’s birthday.

The former footballer was also inundated with critical messages after starring in an advert made on behalf of his local car dealership, Alexanders Prestige, in December.

In the advert he said: 'You've got to go for looks to start with,' said the star in the clip, before adding: 'Then you look inside. It's probably similar to girls isn't it?

'The look attracts you to start with and then you get to know them a bit more, I think it's the same with cars.' 

Michael Owen and Speyside Distillers were unavailable for a comment when contacted.
