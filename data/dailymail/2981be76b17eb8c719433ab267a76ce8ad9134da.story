A mother of two who disappeared in 2002 and was declared legally dead in 2010 has been found alive in Florida, after she turned herself over to police.

Brenda Heist was reported missing by her husband, Lee, on February 8, 2002. The 42-year-old had last been seen that morning dropping off her two children at school in Lititz, Pennsylvania. Her car was found a few days later with no apparent sign of a struggle.

On Friday evening Heist walked into Monroe County Sheriff’s Office in Key Largo, Florida and announced who she was.

Heist has told detectives she left her family because she was in the 
middle of a divorce and was struggling financially. She said the 
pressure was too much and she snapped.

She said she left Lititz after joining a group of homeless people that she met in a park who were hitch hiking to Florida.

When she disappeared, Heist's daughter 
was 8 and her son was 12. Her son recently graduated from West Chester 
University and is applying to a police academy in New Jersey. Her 
daughter is a sophomore at West Chester University.

'She said she thought of her family and her children every day, and her 
parents. However, she never acted on that and never made any phone calls
– not one,' Lititz Police Detective John Schofield told 8WGAL.

She told police that she had decided to turn herself in because she was at the end of her rope and that she was having health 
problems. She now hopes to live with her mom in Texas.

Former neighbor Arlene Bingeman said she couldn't believe Heist could have left her children for such a long time, while Detective Schofield noted that she had never tried to call home

'I can't believe that she would leave her two children,' former neighbor Arlene Bingeman told 8WGAL. 'I just can't, as a mother, I just can't believe that.'

After arriving in the Sunshine State, she had lived as a homeless person in the Key West area, sleeping under bridges and tents and eating food thrown out by fast food restaurants, police said.

In all the years she was missing she never used a bank card or ID, even when she made some money cleaning boats.

Local, state and federal authorities spent months investigating Heist's disappearance in 2002, interviewing dozens of relatives, friends, neighbors and co-workers. She was entered into several national missing persons databases.

Her husband eventually collected her life insurance policy in 2010. Heist is being held in protective custody in Florida.
