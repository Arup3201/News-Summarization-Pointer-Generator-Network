A police boss has been forced to apologise after telling a scandal-hit chief constable the name of woman who accused him of sexism.

Nick Gargan, 47, head of Avon and Somerset Police, was suspended in May after allegations emerged that he had made inappropriate compliments about the appearance of 35 women.

The Independent Complaints Commission launched an investigation, which concluded no criminal charges would be brought.

But the enquiry was brought into disrepute after it emerged Police and Crime Commissioner Sue Mountstevens told Mr Gargan the name of one woman who had made a complaint.

She said: 'In May 2014, I was made aware by a member of my team that someone had approached them and made a verbal complaint against Chief Constable Nick Gargan.

'During a subsequent conversation with Mr Gargan I was discussing a concern I had around how that individual was coping generally, and I mentioned that a complaint had been made against him by that person.

'At the time of the conversation I was not aware of the full facts which became apparent subsequently - including the detail of the allegations being made and the request for whistle-blower status.'

Ms Mountstevens, who is an Independent Party member, said as soon as she became aware of the seriousness of the allegations she voluntarily referred the details of the conversation to the watchdog.

She added: 'A complaint about the disclosure of the name was subsequently made to the Police and Crime Panel, who looked into the matter and found that I had made a mistake.

'I agreed with their finding and I have already written to the individual concerned to apologise for the distress I caused.

'I firmly believe that everyone in public office needs to be held to the same high standard of conduct, which is why I told the IPCC of my conversation before their investigation began.

'I have co-operated fully with the Police and Crime Panel's investigation process.

'This was a new situation for me and, while I could have handled it better, I have learnt from it and employees within the constabulary can feel confident approaching me or my team if they have issues they feel uncomfortable raising elsewhere.

'There are a number of ways staff and officers can raise issues confidentially which include speaking to their line manager, reporting it to the Professional Standards department or by using an anonymous phone line or email system.'

Mr Gargan was suspended on full pay, around £150,000 a year, just 13 months after being appointed by Ms Mountstevens.

It is claimed he sent a text to one young officer saying: 'You are doing a great job - do you fancy a drink tonight?'

Complaints were made by two female members of staff and over 50 officers and staff from the constabulary were interviewed during the investigation.

The British embassy in Paris: According to sources, his close relationship with a senior embassy colleague's daughter was hushed up, and after returning home Mr Gargan, now 47, continued his rise through the ranks

The IPCC has now finished its probe and sent a report to Ms Mountstevens who will decide next month if there is a case to answer for either misconduct or gross misconduct.

Mr Gargan denies any wrongdoing.

During the investigation it also emerged that Mr Gargan had left a previous post at the British embassy in Paris after he developed a close relationship with a senior colleague’s daughter.

It is thought the affinity developed while he was working in France on the investigation into the death of Princess Diana. 

Ms Mountstevens said that she was unaware of Mr Gargan’s unhappy spell in Paris when she appointed him chief constable last year.

Until a month ago he was being tipped as a potential future Scotland Yard commissioner.
