Police nabbed a woman twice in two days for allegedly possessing marijuana on two separate occasions in a Texas town.

Local media reported that Youlanda Levette Whitaker allegedly stashed marijuana inside a Lufkin day care center Monday - and was out on bond before she was allegedly found with marijuana inside her car the next day. 

Lufkin police responded to two people 'packaging marijuana' Monday afternoon, KTRE reported.

A Buick was observed by a Lufkin police officer at Noah's Ark Early Education Center Day Care - and that the driver 'had come out of the building and was sitting in the driver's seat with the door open,' according to the affiliate station. 

Driver Frederick Stuart Ruth, 50, spoke with the police officer, and when pressed about possible drugs, presented him with 'a small baggie with several burnt marijuana blunts and gave them to the officer, saying that was all he had.' 

According to the media outlet, the officer spoke with a Noah's Ark worker, who claimed Whitaker entered the daycare bathroom, while Ruth left.

'[A] gallon-size bag full of marijuana' was discovered by the officer inside the bathroom garbage can, KTRE said, with several marijuana bags tucked into it.

Not again! Whitaker was reportedly found Tuesday driving with marijuana inside her car, with Vlenice Van Arline (right) as a passenger. Van Arline faces a possession of drug paraphernalia charge 

The officer uncovered prescription drugs and marijuana inside both Whitaker's pocketbook and the Buick's glove compartment box, the affiliate station reported.

Whitaker and Ruth face both possession of marijuana in a drug-free zone and possession of a dangerous drug charges, the media outlet reported. 

On Tuesday night, Whitaker was allegedly driving a Buick 'with a defective license plate light' with 50-year-old Vlenice Van Arline riding with her, KTRE said.

Police stopped the car, and with the driver's side window down, 'the officer reported smelling a strong odor of marijuana coming from inside the car.'

Another 'gallon-sized ziplock baggie with a large amount of marijuana in it' was found inside the car, plus two burned blunts, as well as another marijuana pouch and some burned marijuana, KTRE reported.

From the Tuesday incident, the station said that Whitaker faces a charge of state-jail felony possession of marijuana in a drug-free zone, and Van Arline faces a possession of drug paraphernalia charge.

The Lufkin Police Department did not immediately return a request for more information from MailOnline.
