It's only been a couple of weeks since Kim Kardashian revealed her shocking new platinum do amid the whirlwind of Paris fashion week. 

However, the  Keeping Up With The Kardashians star is already finding that she has to work pretty hard to maintain the look.

Just this week, Kim posted a picture of herself having her dark roots touched up for the third time.

Kim bleached her hair for the third time this week saying that being a blonde is a 'full-time job'... but a top celebrity hairdresser has warned Kim not to hit the bottle too often 

Now celebrity hairdresser Andrew Jose, ambassador for Salon Science, has warned that if she's not careful, Kim could suffer from some serious breakage for her blond look.

Andrew, who has styled the tresses of Alanis Morissette, Jamie Campbell Bower and Louise Redknapp, says: 'This type of bleach blonde look goes beyond fashion and if done well can look high-end and powerful. 

'Be warned though, this look is definitely not for the faint-hearted. Not only does maintaining the regrowth take a lot of commitment but the chemical process of bleach on the hair can be incredibly damaging.'

When Kim posted the picture of herself having her hair done again, she said: 'Being blonde is a full -time job!,' and it seems she's not far wrong. 

Kim has been showing off her bright blonde hair for the last couple of weeks after debuting her new look at Paris Fashion week 

Andrew says: 'Of all the colouring methods, bleach is the most damaging, and should always be done professionally and slowly.

'Bleaching raises the cuticle on the hair, removing colour pigment permanently from the hair shaft, a process which is called oxidation. 

'Bleaching can permanently raise the cuticle, leaving hair dry, brittle and porous. Overlapping bleach in the same place leaves hair feeling weak and elastic, which can then lead to hair breakage.' 

He added: 'Overuse and repeated application of bleach to the scalp can strip the hair of moisture and damage the follicle. 

'This may cause the hair to either fall out from the root or to break at the weakest point along the hair shaft.' 

Any would-be blondes should think about trying a toner before giving the bleach a go, says Andrew.

Light fantastic? Kim's hair has been getting lighter and brighter ever since she went blonde in Paris (right) 

Gentlemen prefer blondes: Kim's husband Kanye is thought to be a big fan of her blonde locks, the star  has previously said that he prefers her with lighter hair

'Bleaching takes hair to a very raw colour state. Try to embrace the tones of your blonde and adapt the shade using a toner to bring out golds or introduce ash colour layers,' said Andrew.

'To achieve the bleached-blonde look and keep your hair as healthy as possible always ensure that it is done professionally. 

'Your colourist will know not to overlap bleach on the hair. Depending on how quickly your hair grows, the purest of blondes will need to have root maintenance every two weeks.'

Andrew recommends using protein-enriched products to strengthen the hair, which add strength to the hair shaft and prevent breakage.'

He said: 'There are many benefits of using leave-in products that stay on the hair shaft and continue to work after application.' 

Having debuted her hair at Paris Fashion Week, Kim revealed that she was inspired to go for the look by Madonna.

She said: 'I’ve always had this image of Madonna with platinum hair in my references folder on my computer and I’ve been waiting a long time to try the look.

'I thought what better time than right now for Paris Fashion Week?' 

But Kim says she may not keep her new look forever. 

She said: 'It was a really last-minute decision, and I loved taking this risk. It’s a fun look, but I’m not sure how long it’ll last.'
