An airline worker was accidentally shot at a ticket counter by a passenger trying to check a hunting rifle for a flight, police said.

Edward Deubler, 65, of Harvey, near New Orleans, was trying to check the rifle with an employee at the United Airlines ticket desk.

But the gun discharged at the Louisiana airport and the bullet struck a counter before shrapnel hit an employee in his leg, police said.

The incident happened on Monday morning at Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport in Louisiana, reported The Times-Picayune.

Deubler has been issued with a misdemeanour summons for negligent injury, a Jefferson Parish Sheriff’s Office spokesman said.

The bullet fragmented when it hit the counter and a piece of shrapnel went into the employee’s leg, reported WDSU.

He was taken to a hospital but his injuries were not life-threatening.

A Transportation Security Administration (TSA) spokesman told The Times-Picayune that guns are allowed in checked baggage.

But they must be declared during the ticket counter check-in process, unloaded and in a hard-sided locked container.

‘We are reviewing the circumstances surrounding this incident,’ a TSA spokesman said.

Three teenagers were arrested last month by police in the same city after a car chase that ended in a shooting outside the same airport.
