Russian President Vladamir Putin blew off U.S. president Barack Obama's claims this morning that he not telling the truth about his government's relationship with pro-Russian separatists in Ukraine.

'Who is he to judge, ' Putin told CNBC during an interview this morning.

'Who is he to judge, seriously?' he repeated, according to a translator. 'If he wants to judge people, why doesn't he get a job in court somewhere?'

'If [President Obama] wants to judge people, why doesn't he get a job in court somewhere?' Russian President Vladimir Putin said during an interview today

Putin made the comments during an on-stage interview at the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum as CNBC host Geoff Cutmore was telling him Obama had 'accused you, as you know, of untruths when it comes to supporting some of the separatists groups...'

At that point, Putin interrupted Cutmore to make fun of president Obama, which drew laughter from the audience.

In a more somber tone, Putin told added, 'I don't think he accused me.'

'It's his point of view. And I have my point of view, when it comes to certain things,' he said.

Cutmore then tried to ask him if his country would allow Ukraine's scheduled election to take proceed peacefully this Sunday, to which Putin said, 'Oh come, on, really? He's a difficult man to deal with. Where did you get this guy?'

Putin said today that the crisis in Ukraine had evolved into a full-scale civil war and blaming the West for escalating the crisis

Russia and the U.S. have been engaged in a stand off over the former country's invasion Crimean Peninsula, which was under the control of Ukraine until February.

In March, Crimea broke off from the Ukraine with the help of Russian separatist forces and joined Russia. Russian-backed separatists have since invaded other eastern areas of Ukraine, taken over government buildings, kidnapped journalists and engaged in deadly assaults with Ukrainian security forces.

Russia made an agreement with the U.S. and EU in mid-April that it would use its influence on the pro-Russian forces in Ukraine to get them to vacate power, but the promise never came to fruition.

'So far at least we have seen them not abide by the spirit or the letter of the agreement in Geneva,' President Obama said days later. 'Instead we continue to see malicious, armed men taking over buildings, harassing folks who are disagreeing with them, destabilizing the region and we haven't seen Russia step out and discouraging it.'

When Russia still did not fulfill its part of the agreement, the U.S. introduced sanctions on a handful of the countries businesses, singling out the ones whose executives had close ties with Russia's leader.

'The goal here is not to go after Mr. Putin personally,' President Obama said in announcing the sanctions.

'The goal is to change his calculus,' Obama said, and 'encourage him to actually walk the walk and not just talk the talk when it comes to diplomatically resolving the crisis in Ukraine.'

On Friday Putin claimed that the West was the blame for the instability in Ukraine, not Russia, and 'now, they want us to clean up the mess they created.'

Putin called the sanctions on his friends 'illegal' and said they ought to sue the U.S.

'They don't have any relation to the events in Ukraine or Crimea, he said.

'Maybe the Americans, who are quite shrewd, want to win a competitive edge over Europe by insisting on introducing sanctions against Russia?'

Putin acknowledged that that sanctions have hurt his friends' businesses but said they are 'experienced entrepreneurs' and will be just fine.

The Russian leader also predicted that the U.S.' sanctions on his country would end up backfiring.

'Economic sanctions as a tool of political pressure are eventually going to attack the economy of the countries who have initiated the sanctions,' he said. 

Putin joked that 'you can’t force people to like you' but he  hopes 'common sense, good sense and national interest, will push' the U.S. and the other European countries that have place sanctions on his country to continue working with his country.
