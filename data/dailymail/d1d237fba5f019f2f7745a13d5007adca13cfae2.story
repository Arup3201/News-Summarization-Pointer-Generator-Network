A mother-of-four was stripped naked, pepper-sprayed and left in a jail cell for hours after being arrested for a misdemeanor, according to a lawsuit filed on Thursday.

Tabitha Gentry, 31, was arrested at her home New Albany, Indiana on March 30 for disorderly conduct and resisting an officer after an alleged dispute with her estranged husband.

After being taken to Floyd County Jail, which is run by the county sheriff's department, Ms Gentry is seen on surveillance camera being stripped naked by four officers - two men and two women.

Mother-of-four Tabitha Gentry, 31, who was arrested on a misdemeanor charged was stripped by four officers at an Indiana jail in March

The officers pin the woman to the ground and forcibly remove every item of her clothing

The woman is seen on the jail surveillance tape, which has no idea, approaching the door. Her lawyer said that she was pleading with officers to give her clothes

Prior to being stripped, Ms Gentry is seen on tape walking into the jail in handcuffs in what appears to be a calm manner.

According to her attorney, the woman then had a 'verbal altercation' with police. Jail officials reportedly told The Courier-Journal that the prisoner was drunk and lashing out at officers.

After being stripped, Ms Gentry is then left in a cell completely naked. Although the surveillance tape has no audio, she appears to be in distress and approaches the prison door, where her lawyer said she asked for clothes to cover herself.

After an hour, an officer sprays a can of pepper spray into the room, causing Ms Gentry to back up against the wall.

This is not Abu Ghraib. This is someone charged with misdemeanor crimes in Indiana.

Attorney Laura Landenwich

According to The Courier-Journal, a report from the jail said that Ms Gentry was making a lot of noise and upsetting other prisoners. 

Ms Gentry's lawyer Laura Landenwich told The Huffington Post: 'This is not Abu Ghraib. This is someone charged with misdemeanor crimes in Indiana.'

She added: 'There are lots of rules about how a 
strip search is conducted, but this was not a strip search. They weren't searching her for anything. This was sexual
 humiliation.'

The woman was then left in the cell with pepper spray covering her naked body including her genitals, her lawyer said.

Ms
 Landenwich said that her client was then led out of the cell to wash 
out her eyes. She was given a smock that left parts of her body exposed 
and led through a public area by a male officer.

Ms Gentry backs up against the cell wall to try to escape the pepper spray which coated her naked body, including her genitals, her lawyer said

She was then returned to the cell in the smock for another five hours before being booked.

Ms Gentry is one of four people who have filed a class action lawsuit against Floyd County Jail. The others who are suing also claim there was 'offensive touching' at the jail.

MailOnline was awaiting a response from Ms Landenwich.

Multiple attempts were made to contact the sheriff's department with no response.
