Guns, gangs and violence are often the things associated with Grant Theft Auto, but one group of gamers play the smash hit to point something altogether less dangerous than a pistol... a camera.

These stunning images may look like they were taken by professionals using quality equpiment but they were actually snapped by a group of photographers gathered into a group on GTA V.

Phil Rose, a professional landscape photographer, began taking shots with the game's camera phone app and was so amazed by the level of detail he began uploading his images to the web.

Future photography: British born photographer Phil Rose uses GTA V's camera phone feature to take these stunning images. He travels around the massive landscape of the game to find beauty spots before using his real life skills to perfectly frame the pictures. He shared the images on a blog which was shared by gamers.

Soon Phil, 45, had requests of tens 
of photographers looking to join his Flickr group 'Landscape 
photographers of Los Santos and Blaine County', named after the fictional city in which the game is set.

The group has a strict policy of no 
selfies, shooting and killing images or those of a violent or sexual 
reference, eliminating some of the traditional features associated with
GTA.

Phil, originally from the UK but 
currently living in Washington State, USA, hopes his group of snap-happy
gamers can eventually have an in-game get-together when Grand Theft 
Auto's online mode is activated in the coming weeks.

Camera community: Although these pictures are all taken by the 45-year-old, who lives in Washington, GTA photography has taken off since the launch of the latest game. Phil said he has been inundated with requests from other players who want to join his 'posse', Landscape 
photographers of Los Santos and Blaine County

He said: 'It is pretty close to the 
experience of taking photographs with a camera phone - no exposure 
control, minimal zoom but at least there's a rule-of-thirds overlay.

'I wish there were in store camera 
shops as there are gun shops. I want to be able to buy a replica of my 
Pentax K5ii so I can do HDR or even under or over expose images.

'I want to be able to blur headlights or freeze a leaping deer

Keeping it clean: The rules of Phil's in-game photography club are very strict with no 
selfies, shooting and killing images or those of a violent or sexual 
reference allowed. He said by banning some of the scene's normally associated with GTA, they can show how the game can be used for more cultured pursuits.

'I made the group because I realised I
could make realistic images and art. I'm fascinated by the future of 
gaming and I see that it will become more and more like reality, and I 
think this is one minor way of pushing that forward.

'The game is beautiful, spacious, 
interesting, hilarious.

'There is no reason that one 
shouldn't be able to put together a 'posse' in-game, which is dedicated 
to wandering the hills of Blaine County and chatting via Bluetooth 
headsets about life, the universe and photography, whilst taking 
pictures and even giving composition suggestions.'

Real life: Professional snapper Phil Rose, above, did not have any zoom, aperture or exposure control in the game, so he had to rely on his trained eye to see the perfect picture. The GTA fan is now hoping that game developers Rock Star will introduce more camera features so that gamers can enjoy culture as well as crime.
