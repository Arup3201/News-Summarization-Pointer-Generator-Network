Two million over-40s will face ‘chronic loneliness’ in their old age because of the breakdown of traditional families, a report warns today.

Despite ‘significant falls’ in the number of pensioners living in poverty, many face a bleak retirement, according to the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR).

The situation is so stark that the report suggests copying a German scheme where older people with no children, or whose families live far away, are encouraged to ‘adopt’ grandchildren raised in single parent families to help them in old age.

As divorce among the middle-aged soars, the Institute of Public Policy Research warned of chronic loneliness

The study predicts that the number of over-60s will soar from five million to 20 million by the year 2033. Of these, around one in ten will be leading chronically lonely lives.

‘Longer life expectancy, the breakdown of extended families and the growing number of older people living alone is making it harder for older people to sustain strong relationships and connections to community life,’ the report says.

‘On current projections it can be expected that nearly two million people will be experiencing chronic loneliness by 2033.

‘This includes over 800,000 people in their 80s and 90s who typically have mobility problems that make it hard for them to stay active.

‘We are not doing enough in Britain to ensure that this rapidly growing group of people has the necessary opportunities to sustain their relationships and take part in activities that give meaning to their lives.’

The IPPR says the development will have major consequences for Britain’s social care bill unless action is taken.

It warns that ever more older people will
 become dependent on the state for care as they lose touch with family 
members who might once have helped them lead more independent lives.

The study predicts the number of older 
people in need of care will outstrip the number of family members able 
to provide unpaid help for the first time in 2017.

By 2030, an estimated 230,000 older people in England who need more than 20 hours a week of care will be left without relatives to help.

The report stresses that older people are not just recipients of care – they are also among the main providers. The number of people providing significant care for an ageing spouse is forecast to rise by 90 per cent by 2030.

It suggests that Britain should follow the lead of countries such as Germany and Australia in building greater alternative care provision for the future.

Authorities in Berlin are encouraging the childless to ‘adopt’ grandchildren from single parent families in the hope they may look after them in old age.

The state-backed scheme helps people find suitable families who have children under ten. In many cases, children have lost contact with their own grandparents who may live far away.

Their new ‘grandparents’ socialise with the family and may help with things such as babysitting.

Some 480 matches have been made to date, with many of the youngsters keeping in touch with their adoptive grandparents into adulthood.

In Western Australia, each community has a dedicated ‘neighbourhood care co-ordinator’ who looks out for those living alone.

Clare McNeil, of the IPPR, urged the Government to take action to prevent  a care crisis, saying: ‘The supply of unpaid care to older people with support needs by their adult children will not keep pace with future demand.’
