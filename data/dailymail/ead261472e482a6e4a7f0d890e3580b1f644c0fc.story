Arsene Wenger certainly won't be short of exciting attacking options as he plots the downfall of champions Manchester City on Saturday.

There have been a few injury concerns over the international break, with Aaron Ramsey, Mikel Arteta and Mesut Ozil picking up knocks.

But it appears Wenger will have a clean bill of health and all his Gunners back firing in the top-of-the-table clash at the Emirates.

With £16m deadline day signing Danny Welbeck to throw into the mix, Wenger faces a bit of a selection conundrum in attack.

Luckily for the Frenchman, the back line pretty much picks itself at the minute. Wojciech Szczesny will have Mathieu Debuchy, Laurent Koscielny and Per Mertesacker in front of him.

Kieran Gibbs is set to return at left-back in place of Nacho Monreal if the Englishman can prove he's recovered fully from a hamstring injury.

All five will have to be at their best to repel City's free-flowing front line and Wenger would be wise to deploy either captain Mikel Arteta or Aaron Ramsey directly in front of them. 

Arteta is back in full training following his ankle injury and is likely to come back in, but some question marks remain over Ramsey after he rolled his ankle on Wales duty.

In keeping with the system utilised this season, the midfield then fans out with Jack Wilshere on one side and Santi Cazorla on the other.  

With Welbeck set to take up his position as the target man, Alexis Sanchez will drop back to the right side.

Mesut Ozil should be available after returning early from international duty with a sprained ankle and will feature on the left.

The dilemma for Wenger is that this line-up omits the likes of Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Calum Chambers - emphasising the strong options he has at his disposal.

Ozil will be the one to make way if Wenger feels City will be rattled by the pace of Oxlade-Chamberlain.

Wenger needs to be wary of being too gung-ho against City - they will pick Arsenal off if given the chance - but they need to make some kind of statement that they are not cowed by these big games.

Arsenal have collected just 26 points from a possible 90 against top four opponents over the last five seasons - an awful record that has prevented them sustaining a title challenge.

Now, however, there should be optimism around the Emirates that Arsenal have the personnel to do just that.

Robbie Savage has called for Mikel Arteta and Mesut Ozil to be kept out of Arsenal's team for the visit of Manchester City.

Writing in his Daily Mirror column, Savage says Ozil was a 'passenger' for much of Arsenal's 1-1 draw at Leicester prior to the international break.

He also believes Mathieu Flamini and Aaron Ramsey should play in place of Arteta, despite the captain's return to fitness.
