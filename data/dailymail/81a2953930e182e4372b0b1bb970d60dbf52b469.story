The Spaniards already boast some of the weirdest festivals in the world, such as the bull running of Pamplona and the world’s biggest tomato fight, but this one definitely tops the list.

The annual Jarramplas Festival in Piornal involves hundreds of villagers attacking a man dressed in a devils mask with 15,000 turnips. The best part? No-one really knows why.

A young man from the village is selected to be the 'Jarramplas' - the scape goat - and dresses up in a costume made from colourful strips of fabric, donning a devil-like mask with great horns and nose.

Turnip tradition: People throw turnips at the 'Jarramplas' as he makes his way through the streets beating his drum during the Jarramplas Festival in Piornal, Spain

Strange custom: The bizarre annual holiday sees a male villager dress up as devil-figure Jarramplas and run through the streets of Piornal whilst he is pelted with turnips

Turnip target: The Jarramplas' costume is made from hundreds of colourful strips of fabric and he wears a big mask with horns and a snout as he runs through the village banging a drum

The Jarramplas then enters the 
streets, banging his drum to call out the villagers who gather in their 
hundreds with armfuls of turnips.

They chase the Jarramplas around the 
village, continuously pelting him with the rock-hard root vegetables at 
every possible chance they get.

It is a centuries long tradition and is celebrated every January on Saint Sebastian Day in the 
village in Extremadura, western Spain which has just over 1,500 
inhabitants.

There are several theories behind the Jarramplas tradition, most point to a connection between the festival and punishing cattle thieves.

Five-a-day: Although the origin of the festival is undetermined, the vegetable pelting symbolise the expulsion of everything bad

Nowhere to run: As is tradition, the crowd has cornered the Jarramplas outside the local church where they furiously throw the rock-hard turnips

Topsy turn-y tradition: Every year hundreds travel to the little village in Extremadura, which has 1,500 inhabitants, to pelt a man in devil costume with big root vegetables

Theory is that the pelting of the 
Jarramplas with turnips originates in the punishment and expulsion of a 
cattle thief by American Indians, witnessed by the first conquerors.

Another is that it mirrors the punishment of the cattle-thieving giant Cacus by Hercules in Greek mythology.

However, in modern times, Jarramplas is a devil figure and the turnip throwing symbolise the expulsion of everything bad.

The Jarramplas Festival is not the 
only odd celebration in Spain - and surprisingly not the only one which 
involves throwing vegetables.

Lads game: The part-takers in the turnip-throwing is predominantly young men who compete in throwing the most turnips the hardest

Feeding the beast: The village imports 14,000 turnips every year to throw at the Jarramplas

La Tomatina is an annual food fight 
in Bunol, Valencia which sees thousands of people travel from all over 
the world to thrown tomatoes at each other.

Last year over 50,000 participants 
threw more than 150,000 rotten tomatoes on the streets – a tradition 
which has been going on since 1945.

Bull runs are held across Spain but the most popular one is the annual run in Pamplona, which is broadcast live on television.

About 200-300 people are injured in 
the Pamplona bull run every year, and 15 people have died since 1910. 
Most were gored to death by the 18-strong bull heard.

Annual madness: The centuries old Jarramplas festival takes place annually every January 19-20 on Saint Sebastian Day

Duck: Two women take cover behind a door grate at the Jarramplas, already wading through turnips, makes his way through the streets beating his drum

Job done: This year's 'Jarramplas', Juan Jose Prieto, 26, is cheered on by the crowds after his run through the village is finished
