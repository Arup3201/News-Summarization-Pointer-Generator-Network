Arsenal had a lucky escape not signing Luis Suarez last summer, according to former defender Sol Campbell.

The Gunners launched an audacious £40,000,001 bid for the Uruguay international but were knocked back by the Merseyside club.

Suarez went onto score 31 goals in the Premier League as Liverpool finished second.

Lucky escape: Sol Campbell says Luis Suarez would not have been a good fit for Arsenal 

Suarez has since gone on to leave Anfield for Barcelona for £75million – almost double the amount bid by Arsenal.

And Campbell says the striker would not have been a good fit at The Emirates due to his disciplinary issues after being banned for biting twice in the last two seasons. 

Suarez is currently serving a four month ban for the incident at the World Cup and is unable to play for Barcelona until late October. 

Odd behavior: Suarez was banned for biting Giorgio Chiellini during the World Cup 

Trouble: Suarez was banned for biting Chelsea's Branislav Ivanovic at the end of the 2012-13 season

Campbell told Goal.com: 'Mentality-wise he would not have been a good fit for Arsenal.

'He has been caught [biting players] a few times now, including Brainslav Ivanovic. He has said he is sorry, but it is not a classy thing to do. He has done it on the biggest stage ever [at the World Cup] and for me it shows a lack of respect.

'There are so many kids watching and billions of fans around the world. Maybe Barcelona can sort him out.'

Speaking out: Sol Campbell is pelased Suarez did not sign for Arsenal
