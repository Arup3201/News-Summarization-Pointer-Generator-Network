Greenpeace activists have staged an hour-long rooftop protest at computer giant Apple's European headquarters - protesting at the electricity burned by 'cloud' data centres.

As more and more companies store data online, huge data centres use increasing amounts of electricity to store this information - arousing the ire of green activists.

The group claims some burn as much as 250,000 homes - and scaled Apple's to protest.

Ironically, Apple's is powered by clean energy.

Greenpeace activists scale the Apple headquarters offices in Cork City to demand that the company switches from coal to renewable energy sources to power their cloud computing data center

Apple says that the activist group's actions were targeted at data centres which are in fact among the 'greeenest' ever built.

'Our data center in North Carolina will draw about 20 megawatts at full capacity, and we are on track to supply more than 60% of that power on-site from renewable sources including a solar farm and fuel cell installation which will each be the largest of their kind in the country,' said a spokesperson today.

'We believe this industry-leading project will make Maiden the greenest data center ever built, and it will be joined next year by our new facility in Oregon running on 100% renewable energy.'

Kumi Naidoo, Greenpeace International executive director, said customers of some of the world leading IT and internet companies want to know the companies' energy policies are sustainable.

‘When people around the world share their music or photos on the cloud, they want to know that the cloud is powered by clean, safe energy,’ he said.

A number of protesters scaled the Apple building in Holyhill at around 7am and voluntarily came down after an hour.

Gardai and the fire service were called to the scene and other activists distributed leaflets to staff.

Greenpeace, which praised Apple's energy policy in Ireland, also staged protests over cloud computing centres in Turkey and Luxembourg.

It is angered over the use of coal generated energy for new cloud sites.

Iris Cheng, campaigner from Greenpeace International, said some major IT companies are not innovative enough about how they power their centres.

‘Coal is one of the dirtiest fuels on the planet, causing untold damage to the environment and global climate,’ she said.

Gardai look on as Greenpeace activists scale the Apple HQ offices in Cork City and display a clear message 'Clean Our Cloud'

‘A company that prides itself for its vision and innovation should not be using outdated polluting coal.

‘The irony here in Cork is that Apple's HQ is powered by renewable energy sources. The much needed jobs this HQ provides to the local community are also increasing the jobs in the Irish renewable energy sector. Apple has shown it can power with clean energy in Cork, it is now time to clean up globally.’

Ireland is increasingly becoming an important base for cloud computing with the Government and investors highlighting the cool climate and westerly weather patterns as a big draw.

A Greenpeace study found that companies like Apple, Google, Facebook, Yahoo!, Amazon and Microsoft are building more data centres for customers to store and share information.

The units house thousands of computers and consume huge amounts of electricity with

Greenpeace claiming some can use as much electricity as 250,000 European homes.
