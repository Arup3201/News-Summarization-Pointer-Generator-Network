Former Play School presenter Floella Benjamin has warned that children are suffering 'psychological damage' from prolonged internet access.

Baroness Benjamin, now a Liberal Democrat peer, said youngsters were being exposed to 'damaging material' including pornography, violence and cyberbullying on a daily basis.

And she renewed her calls for parents to ban youngsters from having access to televisions in their rooms.

Actress and television presenter Floella Benjamin used a speech in the House of Lords to criticise parents who allow their children to have TVs in their bedrooms

Lady Benjamin told a House of Lords 
debate on childhood: 'Worryingly, we have no idea of the long-term 
implications for how all this will affect their personal and social 
development.

'There are dangers and hidden 
consequences of the digital age and we do not yet know how it will 
affect the way our children's brains develop and their thought 
processes.'

‘For years, I have spoken out and pleaded with parents not to allow children to watch television or access computers in their bedrooms, especially late at night,’ she said.

Last week she visited several schools across the country and was ‘shocked’ by how many children were able to watch TV in their bedrooms.

‘Apart from children being tired and unable to concentrate in school, they are being exposed to psychologically damaging material, including violence, pornography, cyberbullying, sexual grooming by online predators and manipulative content, as well as self-harm and suicide websites, all on a daily basis.

‘Sadly, many children are having to face peer pressure to conform and are made to feel inadequate if they are not part of this techno revolution.’

This week leading psychologist Dr Aric Sigman urged parents to drastically cut the number of hours children spend watching television. Under threes should be banned altogether.

‘Reducing total daily screen time for children, and delaying the age at 
which they start, could provide significant advantages for their health 
and wellbeing,' he wrote in the influential medical journey Archives Of Disease In Childhood.
