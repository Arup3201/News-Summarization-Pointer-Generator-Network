The death of a star Australian batsman stunned the cricket world yesterday and led to immediate concerns over the safety of helmets worn by players of all ages.

Phillip Hughes died two days after being struck behind the ear by a ball while batting. Hughes, 25, who played against England in last summer’s Ashes and had represented three English county teams, did not regain consciousness after the sickening blow.

Although he was wearing a helmet, a bouncer struck him on an unprotected part of his neck as he turned his back attempting a shot.

The impact split his vertebral artery, causing a massive bleed. Surgeons in Sydney operated on Hughes to try to relieve the pressure on his brain but he died yesterday.

As his devastated Australia team-mates mourned, the cricket world paid tribute to Hughes and rallied to support Sean Abbott, 22, the bowler who delivered the fatal ball, describing the tragedy as a freak accident.

Manufacturers have been exploring ways to make cricket helmets safer – but they have faced resistance from the players and experts admit no helmets currently available would have been guaranteed to save Hughes, a left-hander who had represented Australia in 26 Tests.

Under England and Wales Cricket Board regulations, all schoolchildren are required to wear helmets while batting and keeping wicket. New safety standards were introduced in Britain earlier this year, expanding the area of the grille in front of the face and jaw so a ball could not sneak through the gaps.

The peak was stiffened and more protection provided around the cheekbones and at the back of the head. Even these improvements provide no protection for the vulnerable area at the back of the neck.

Researchers from Loughborough and Cardiff University found last year that six per cent of cricket injuries result from balls striking the neck and a further 17 per cent from impacts on the back of the helmet.

They recommended lowering the back of the shell to cover most of the neck. Rene Ferdinands, of the University of Sydney, said helmets could be changed, with a foam skull cap worn underneath to cover the back of the neck.

But changes to helmets have been opposed by players, who are said to believe such a design would reduce a batsman’s mobility as the ball hurtles towards him at around 90mph.

Brendan Denning, chief executive of sports equipment firm Albion, said: ‘The ability of manufacturers to innovate is reliant on players embracing new technology and they are very, very traditional in cricket.

'Other sports, like horse racing, more readily accept that injury is an issue.’

Masuri – the firm that made the helmet Hughes was wearing – said the cricketer was not using its most recent model, which gives batsmen extra protection in the neck area.

However, a spokesman for the firm added: ‘This is a vulnerable area of the head and neck that helmets cannot fully protect while enabling batsmen to have full and proper movement.’

Professor Antonio Belli of Birmingham University, a sports trauma expert, said the devastating injury Hughes suffered while playing for South Australia against New South Wales was simply bad luck. ‘We should design helmets as strong as technology allows,’ he said.

‘But we need to accept that in cricket and other sports that involve hard objects or bodily contact there will always be freak accidents.’

Former England star Geoff Boycott said helmets have given cricketers a false sense of security. He wrote in the Daily Telegraph: ‘Most of my career I batted without a helmet. You required judgment of what to leave, when to duck and when to play the ball. Helmets have taken away a lot of that fear.’

Ex-England captain Andrew Strauss said the natural response to tragedy was that massive change was needed, but added: ‘The protection in the game of cricket has never been better than it is today. I don’t think any cricketer will go out there to bat these days worrying that his life might be on the line.’
