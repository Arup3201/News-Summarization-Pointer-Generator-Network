Ford is trying to show young drivers just exactly how dangerous drinking and driving is with a new 'drunk suit' that simulates the effects of being intoxicated.

A simple device, the suit consists of a unbalanced ankle and wrist weights, braces to restrict joint movement, and Fatal Vision brand 'beer goggles' that blur eyesight.

Also included is a pair of headphones to impair hearing.

Fox News reports that the suit is being used for the company's Driving Skills for Life program.

The suit makes even the simplest motor skills nearly impossible to accomplish.

A reporter who tested the suit was unable to hit a target with a beanbag from only 15 feet away while wearing the suit despite repeated attempts, and reported feeling so disoriented that he became queasy.

The suit is said to be so effective Ford will only allow students to wear the full set of weights and braces while outside of a vehicle, allowing only the beer goggles for road tests in a safe location.

Student drivers are also put behind the wheel of a Mustang modified to simulate skids

Participants in Ford's program are also asked to drive while texting, often getting the same results as they do while wearing the disorientating goggles.

They also use a Ford Mustang modified to simulate emergency skids at low speeds.
