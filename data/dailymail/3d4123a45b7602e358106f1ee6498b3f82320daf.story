He's known for flaunting his wealth and not much has seemed to change in the new year, as Floyd Mayweather took to Instagram on Friday to ask his array of followers what pair of shoes and sunglasses he should wear from his vast collection.

The 37-year-old posted a picture of his shoes closet, completely full to the brim, saying: 'I'm having a hard time choosing which #ChristianLouboutin shoes I want to wear. 

'I could only fit 80 pairs of #redbottoms in this photo. Can someone please help me choose which ones I should put on?'

Just a few hours later Mayweather took to Instagram again, asking his followers to guess what pair of glasses he'll be wearing on Friday night.

He added: 'Let's play a game... Can anyone guess which glasses I'll be wearing tonight?www.themoneyteam.com'.

Last year Mayweather also showed off his prestigious watch collection on Instagram, which included eight Rolexes and eight of the Audermars brand, with the 24 items totalling up to be worth more than £5million.
