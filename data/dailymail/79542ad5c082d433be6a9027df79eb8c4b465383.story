Given her fiery reputation, it perhaps wasn’t the most sensible thing to say.

Unsurprisingly, Nancy Dell’Olio took great exception to being described by Bruno Tonioli as looking as though she had 'inhaled two gallons of Veuve Clicquot' during her latest Strictly performance.

She was so furious that she told friends she was considering legal action against the judge.

Miss Dell’Olio, 50, claimed that although her penchant for champagne is well known, she did not drink at all before the live broadcast.

And she insisted she does not keep ten to 15 bottles in her dressing room at any one time, as has been rumoured.

Instead, she said a case of champagne in her room was for stylists and other production staff, to show her gratitude.

Miss Dell’Olio performed at the weekend despite having a torn ligament in her knee. She received the lowest score from the judges, but viewers kept her in the show at the expense of Edwina Currie.

Jibe: Bruno's comments were tongue in cheek and not meant to cause offence, a BBC spokesman said

One friend said: 'She was having trouble walking and her leg was in real pain – but she thought the show must go on, so took to the floor.

'To then have Bruno accuse her of being drunk, she found very upsetting. She has considered legal action – but everyone’s been calming her down.'

It was believed last night that the American-Italian had been persuaded against suing.

A BBC spokesman said: 'The judges always look to give constructive criticism to all of our dancers and this is often delivered with humour, given that Strictly is an entertainment show. Bruno’s comments were tongue in cheek and not meant to cause offence.'

Good intentions: Nancy left her home to go training, but couldn't resist stopping off at designer shop on the way
