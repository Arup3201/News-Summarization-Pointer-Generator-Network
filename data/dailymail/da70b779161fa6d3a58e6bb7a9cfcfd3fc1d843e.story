A valedictorian and star student at the University of Michigan has been convicted of bludgeoning and stabbing his mentally unstable mother to death in their home.

Jeffrey Pyne, 22, had been charged with first-degree 
premeditated murder in the death of Ruth Pyne in May 2011, but after two days of deliberation, the jury convicted him of the lesser offense of second-degree murder.

Pyne, who shook his head in disbelief as the verdict was announced on Tuesday afternoon, will be sentenced on January 29 and likely faces eight to 12 years behind bars.

Pyne was arrested five months after his mother, 51, was found dead in the garage of their Highland Township, Michigan home and held without bond for more than a year.

Disbelief: Pyne shook his head as the second-degree murder conviction was announced in court on Tuesday

Prosecutors claimed Jeffrey was known to have a temperamental 
relationship with his mother, who suffered from 
several mental illnesses.

She was bipolar and had spent two 
weeks in jail nine months before her death for attempting to strangle 
Jeffrey, according to reports, and prosecutors claim he became fed up of the situation.

From 1998 onwards, she would threaten to kill herself and her son.
After this she was diagnosed with being both bipolar and a paranoid 
schizophrenic.

Over the coming years, psychiatrists 
would describe her as 'angry and violent', 'severely mentally ill', 'a 
danger to herself and others' and suffering from 'acute mania', court 
records show.

Prosecutors claimed Jeffrey, unable to deal with his mother anymore, struck her and broke her arm and skull 
with a wooden board before stabbing her 16 times.

Detective Steve Zdravaovski said 
that traces of Ruth's blood was found in the drain of the upstairs tub, 
implying that the murderer went to the first floor to clean after the 
afternoon murder.

Prosecutors also showed jurors photos of 
the blisters on Jeffrey's hands hours after the murder. He explained the
wounds to his boss as the results of throwing a shipping pallet.

'It did seem odd to me,' his boss, William Cartwright, said. 'I expected more of a splinter or scrape
than what looked like rope burns.'

Struggle: Jeffrey Pyne, who is accused of killing his mother, cries during his interrogation by police

Insistence: In the video, which was shown to the jury in his murder trial, he denies killing his mother

But the defense argued that there was no evidence Pyne killed his mother, saying 
testimony about his emotional state was not worthy of 
consideration in such a serious matter.

The defense has suggested that the 
brutal murder could have been committed by an intruder although nothing 
was stolen from the home, according to the Detroit News.

Jurors also watched a police 
interrogation video showing Pyne crying as he insisted he did nothing to
hurt his mother.

In the tapes, he says he last saw her as he 
helped her unload groceries. He gave her and hug and then went to a 
woman's home a few miles away to plant bushes.

Evidence? The jury was shown images of injuries on Pyne's hands, which he said he sustained at work

Accused: Pyne will be sentenced in January and is expected to get many years behind bars

But the homeowner, Diane Needham, later testified the bushes had been planted the week before.

Despite the claims by prosecutors, community members and Jeffrey's
father Bernard maintained that he is innocent. It took two days to find 
an impartial, 12-member jury.

'The people in the community are 
hugely supportive of this young man,' Detroit Free Press journalist Lori
Brasier told ABC News. 'Even people who believe he may have actually 
killed his mother still support him, and you don't usually find that in 
the community.'
