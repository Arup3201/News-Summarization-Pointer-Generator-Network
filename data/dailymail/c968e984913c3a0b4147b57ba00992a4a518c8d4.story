The founder of fashion site ASOS has separated from his wife amid fears that one of Britain’s biggest ever divorce cases could rock the hugely successful company.

Nick Robertson, one of the UK’s richest men and great-grandson of retailer Austin Reed, is living apart from his wife of ten years.

He is said to have left the £8.3million six-bedroom home in Wimbledon, South-West London, that he shared with his wife Janine and their two daughters, aged five and six.

If they divorced, Mrs Robertson, 41, could win a significant slice of her husband’s £500million fortune.

The couple met on a blind date organised by one of ASOS’s early employees, a friend of Mrs Robertson.

Their break-up could spell chaos for the company if shareholders fear that Mr Robertson may have to sell part of his stake in the brand.

The 46-year-old has a 9.4 per cent share in ASOS, the leading online fashion store, which is worth £5.8billion in total.

Its affordable style is worn  by everyone from Samantha  Cameron to Rihanna – and in 2012 it became the most visited fashion website in the world for 18 to 34-year-olds.

Last April, Mr Robertson was named the 298th richest man in Britain in The Sunday Times Rich List, and he is set to soar up the rankings again.

In the past year, ASOS’s share value has doubled and his stake is now worth £536million. Friends said the couple have been living separately since early this year.

A source said: ‘It is widely known among the Wimbledon set that they have split.

‘I think she got bored of being the housewife. He is a bit of a workaholic and has been travelling a lot with the business. I think they just drifted apart.’

Friend Alex Sandberg, speaking for the couple, said: ‘They are not living together but they are not talking about divorce.’

Mr Robertson attended £29,600-a-year Canford School, in Wimborne, Dorset.

He got two Ds and an F in his A-levels and spent a brief period as a ‘ski bum’ in Meribel, France, before joining advertising firm Young & Rubicam.

In 1996, he and friend Quentin Griffiths set up Entertainment Marketing. Four years later, they launched ASOS with £2.4million, mostly borrowed from friends and family.

Asked in 2009 if he was a workaholic, 
he said: ‘I don’t think so. I work reasonable hours – I have a 
six-month-old baby, and a 16-month-old, so I have family time.’

Asked
 what he spent his money on, he joked about his wife’s passion for 
shopping: ‘I like skiing, football and I’m probably ASOS’s fourth 
biggest customer after my wife. I have quite a simple existence really.’

Mr Robertson, who earned 
£5.8million last year – but took home another £79million after selling 
some of his shares – was crowned Retail Leader of the Year on Thursday 
at the Oracle Retail Week Awards.
