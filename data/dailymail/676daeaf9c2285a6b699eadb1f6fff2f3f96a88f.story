Apple unveiled the fingerprint scanner on its iPhone 5S on Tuesday with bold claims about its high levels of encryption and security.

The firm even suggested that its Touch ID system could revolutionise smartphone security and replace the traditional, everyday password. 

Yet security researchers have warned that the technology is not perfect, with one adding that it 'provides little added security over a four-digit code.'

Apple's iPhone 5S has a fingerprint scanner built into the 'home' button. The Touch ID feature has been designed to replace passwords and phone PINs and can be used to unlock the device but also pay for shopping and apps. Experts predict it will kill off passwords for good

Touch ID uses a small touch sensor encased around the home button that scans the layers of skin on a finger.

user can 'train' their iPhone to 
read and learn their unique fingerprint and when they touch the home 
button, the phone is unlocked.

Touch ID can also be replace an App Store password when buying music, apps or books.

It uses a 'laser cut sapphire 
crystal' to take a high-resolution image scan before the Touch ID software in iOS 7
detemines whether the print belongs to the owner or not.

All fingerprint information is 
encrypted and stored securely inside the device's chip.

The prints are not stored on an Apple server, or backed up to iCloud.

The Touch ID sensor is built into the 
premium phone's 'home' button and can be used to unlock the phone, as 
well as pay for shopping and apps automatically - effectively replacing 
the need for a password or PIN.

Speaking at the launch event in Cupertino, Apple's senior vice president of worldwide marketing Phil Schiller said: 'Half of smartphone customers do not set up passwords. [Touch ID] is an easier and more fun alternative.

'It uses key you have with you everywhere you go. Your finger.'

It uses a 'laser cut sapphire crystal' to take a high-res image scan and the Touch ID software in iOS 7 determines whether the print belongs to the owner or not.

Apple said it is designed to provide 'accurate readings from any angle, so the motion to unlock your device ought to be as automatic as it is now.'

It is also designed to become more accurate the more it is used. 

Schiller reassured users that Touch ID is secure by explaining that 'all fingerprint information is encrypted and stored securely inside the device's chip' adding the prints are not stored on an Apple server, or backed up to iCloud.

Yet security researchers aren't convinced. John Hawes from Sophos Security wrote: In the past, [fingerprint scanners] have proven rather unreliable, plagued with security worries.

Apple's Phil Schiller, pictured, explained the scanner was secure because prints are saved to the chip, and not online. Yet security researchers are concerned that prints can be stolen from anywhere

'Fingerprints are not secret: we leave copies of them wherever we go. Once someone devious has got hold of a copy, sensors can be fooled.'

He continues that, unlike passwords, if fingerprint information is stolen it can't be changed.

Marc Rogers, principal security researcher at Lookout agreed: 'PIN codes can be inconvenient meaning so many users fail to enable them altogether.

'In this case, fingerprint scanning is better than nothing at all, but it provides little added security over a four-digit code.

'Because fingerprints can be lifted and duplicated, they should not be used as the sole credential.'

Speaking at a TechCrunch Disrupt event, Google's manager of information security, Heather Adkins, recently announced that the 'game is over' for passwords and that 'our relationship with passwords are done.'

Fingerprint authentication has become common in high-end laptops from companies such as Dell, Lenovo and Toshiba. Motorola also added a fingerprint scanner to its Atrix handset.

Paypal's chief information security officer predicted that the end of passwords was nigh in May but added biometric technology wouldn't take off until Apple introduced it to a handset.

Neil Norman, founder of Human Recognition Systems added that the release of the iPhone 5S may be the 'catalyst' needed to make the technology mainstream and fuel the demise of the password further.

Although the security features of Apple's Touch ID have not been fully tested, research from Blue Coat Systems said there is a danger in assuming 'fingerprint recognition alone will stop the deluge of data streaming to cyber criminals and competitors.'

Research carried out by password experts Ping Identity found that many people suffer from what's been dubbed 'password amnesia'.

The survey discovered that 34 per cent of consumers need to remember more than five different passwords on a daily basis.

21.6 per cent need to remember more than eight different passwords

The password easiest to remember is a Facebook login (34.5 per cent) ahead of work log-in (25 per cent), online retailer (10.6 per cent) and online banking (12.2 per cent)

Stephen Ebbett, global director of gadget insurer Protect Your Bubble added: 'Being able to use fingerprint security login for iTunes purchases is a nice touch, if it works.

'But while biometrics are typically seen
as more robust than password protection – sweat, dirty pockets, hot and
cold environments, sun exposure, and other factors can affect the 
sensitivity and working conditions of the sensor surface.'

Ebbett also told MailOnline that one of the most common claims for accidental damage to iPhones is screens shattering and he voiced concerns that the phone's durability could be an issue, especially if the fingerprint technology is fragile.

However, not everyone was as quick to dismiss the technology. 

Jonathan French, security analyst for AppRiver told MailOnline: I see adding this feature as a good move on the security side of things and I hope more manufacturers consider adding security measures due to how popular mobile devices are.

'Fingerprint readers for the most part, are a secure method of authentication. It’s not perfect but this new technology will hopefully be an easy authentication step for users to take in securing their phones.'
