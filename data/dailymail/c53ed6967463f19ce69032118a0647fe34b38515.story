Catherine Martin brought some Aussie humour to the 2014 Academy Awards on Sunday evening.

The 49-year-old won both the Best Costume Design and Best Production Design Oscars for her and husband Baz Luhrmann's film The Great Gatsby, becoming the most successful Australian in Oscars history with a now record four gongs to her name.

For her first acceptance speech, the blonde beauty, who was clad in a gorgeous pink and black floral gown, pulled her thank you speech from her bra as she took to the stage.

That's handy! Catherine Martin plucked her acceptance speech from her bra as she took to the stage to accept the Best Costume Design award for her work on The Great Gatsby at the Oscars on Sunday evening

'I do have a few words tucked into my bra... it is a very Australian thing to do!,' she said, prompting the audience to giggle.

During her acceptance speech, Martin, who has designed costumes for several of the couple's films, including Moulin Rouge, Australia and Romeo + Juliet, thanked her team, and her husband of 17 years.

'I would like to thank my team... and, of course, my incomparable husband, Baz Luhrmann. He makes it all possible, he dreams the dream,' she said.

Absent: Catherine thanked her husband Baz Luhrmann, who was not present at the awards, during her acceptance speech 

Luhrmann didn't join his wife at the Oscars on Sunday night, instead he stayed back in Sydney to put the finishing touches on his upcoming Strictly Ballroom musical production, which is set to generate $20m for the local economy.

He did however Tweet his congratulations to his wife, writing: 'Thats my girl! One down, one to go! #Oscars #CatherineMartin #gatsby'.

And it wasn't too long before she scooped up her second award, taking to the stage with Dunn to accept their Best Production Design Oscars.

As well as thanking her colleagues, this time she made sure to say hello to her two children on live television.

'I just have to shout out to my children, "Hi Lily, Hi William!"' she said waving to the cameras.

Martin is now the proud owner of four statuettes after previously winning two Oscars for Moulin Rouge back in 2001, becoming the most successful Australian in Oscars history.

Orry George Kelly, was the previous record holder, winning Academy Awards for An American In Paris in 1951, Les Girls in 1957 and Some Like It Hot in 1959. 

Kisses: Naomi Watts and Samuel L. Jackson presented Martin with her first award. She later went on to win the Best Production Design Award

The successful star was presented her first Oscar on Sunday night by friend and fellow Australian and British-born star, Naomi Watts.

As Martin graced the red carpet she wowed in her vintage-style gown which was heavily embellished at the sleeves and side.

She teamed the dress with a stunning yellow diamond and amethyst necklace and matching bracelet, and black and silver glitter platforms.

She wore her blonde locks in old-Hollywood style curls and applied lashings of  signature red lipstick on her pout.
