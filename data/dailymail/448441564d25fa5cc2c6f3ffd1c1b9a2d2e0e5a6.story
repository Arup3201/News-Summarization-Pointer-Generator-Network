A police officer made a super cute video with his children to depict what they thought their father did in his day to day duties in the Queensland Police Force.

Appropriately titled 'Dad, we know what you do at work!' - Fortitude Valley Senior Sergeant Corey Allen created the LEGO animation through the eyes of his three children.

It is very clear from the adorable storyline that Sergeant Allen's children deem their dad as their everyday hero.

The exotic wife hands her husband a goblet of coffee to kickstart his day of fighting crime

It's not long before the officer must pull over when a man attacks a homeless person

The police LEGO figure starts off his day by being given a mammoth golden goblet filled with coffee from his wife to kickstart his jam-packed day of fighting crime. 

In a very exotic twist, their mother is wearing a grass skirt and a lei as she stands on the front porch to wave goodbye to her husband.

The officer then jumps in his police van and drives past a man who had attacked a homeless person.

Without hesitation the brave sergeant jumps out of the vehicle and wrestles the baddie to the ground before handcuffing him.

The culprit is thrown into the back of the police van and then the officer helps the victim (who happened to own a white pet rabbit) to this feet as they shake hands and part ways.

The bad guy is taken to the police station where the one and only Spider Man appears on the side of the building to help police with their busy day of making society a safer place.

'It is interesting to hear what your kids think police do at work - more interesting these days when they can express their thoughts creatively using technology, Senior Sergeant Allen

'They got most of it right - we do help homeless people all the time, we do catch our fair share of robbers, people do appreciate it when we help them out.'

'I can assure everyone that my wife doesn't get up as early as I do and send me off with a nice cup of coffee, and police don't have super heroes helping them out at the station!'
