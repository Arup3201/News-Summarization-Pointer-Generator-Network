International development minister Desmond Swayne said the government is to review the way the NHS uses staff from poorer countries

The National Health Service's reliance on foreign workers is to be probed amid fears poor countries are suffering from a lack of qualified medics.

There were are almost 70,000 health workers from developing countries working in the NHS.  

International development minister Desmond Swayne today announced the government is to review the impact of health workers being hired in Britain, following calls for the NHS to train staff for the Third World.

MPs warned earlier this year that the staffing of the UK health sector 'should not be at the expense of health systems in developing countries'.

The international development committee called on the government to 'review its approach to the UK recruitment of health workers from overseas'.

The MPs said ministers should consider paying poorer countries whose health workers come to the UK.

It also suggested promoting training schemes involving a temporary UK stay and allowing more medical training to take place in the country of the participants.

In a Commons debate today, Mr Swayne told MPs: 'Some countries in the world export health workers and draw the remittances from that as a positive balance in their balance of trade, or certainly their balance of payments.'

He said he 'recognised this difficulty' and was going to 'surprise' MPs calling for a review.

He added: 'We are commissioning a study, a review of NHS use of foreign workers in exactly the way you challenged me.'

The work by DfID on how the NHS can help other countries was confirmed on November 21 in response to the committee's report. 

David Cameron has promised to crack down on immigration if he wins the next election.

But there have been repeated warnings about the pressure on the NHS to recruit staff from overseas.

Last year the NHS had 68,673 health workers from developing countries, which included 16,615 doctors and 27,032 nurses.

Labour MP Hugh Bayley, a member of the committee, told the debate: 'We need to make sure our health policies in relation to developing countries do no harm and yet in one respect I believe our approach to the health services that we provide for citizens in this country do immense harm to developing countries.

He added: 'If those health workers were working in developing countries they would hugely, hugely, hugely strengthen the health systems in those countries.

'So we need to consider whether the way we run the NHS is appropriate.'

He said: 'If we really want to ensure our healthcare is not good at the expense of poor people in developing countries that's the least we should do.

'If we want to go further then perhaps train two nurses for every one that's in work in the NHS.

Almost a third of doctors working in the NHS were trained outside the UK, according to latest figures

Stephen Nickell, a board member of the Office for Budget Responsibility, yesterday warned the NHS would be in 'dire straits' without the influx of migrant workers to take jobs.

He told MPs on Treasury select committee: 'Some 35 per cent of health professional are migrants.

'It's quite plain that, if they weren't there, the health service would be in absolutely dire straits.'

Last month Witold Sobków, the Polish ambassador to the UK, revealed plans were being drawn up to persuade hundreds of health staff trained in Poland to return home, declaring: 'We want them back.'
