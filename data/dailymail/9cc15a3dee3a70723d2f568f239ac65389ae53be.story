Miami Dolphins offensive lineman Richie Incognito has returned to Twitter to apologize to teammate Jonathan Martin, NFL independent investigator Ted Wells and owner Stephen Ross after comments he made last week on the social network.

Late on Monday evening into early Tuesday morning, Incognito said that he would like to 'apologize for acting like a big baby the last few days' and claimed that 'This has all been so much on me and my family. I just want to play football.'

The u-turn came after the release last Friday of the report into the high-profile bullying of Martin last season which named him as a bullying ringleader, which prompted Incognito to declare on Twitter that he could not be defined 'in 144 years let alone 144 pages'.

Twitter apologies: Miami Dolphins Richie Incognito (68) and Jonathan Martin (71) have been at the center of a shocking allegations of bullying and abuse inside the NFl team's locker room. On Monday and Tuesday - Incognito retracted comments he had made in the aftermath of a report into the alleged abuse

He also questioned the impartiality of the investigation by and claimed it could not be independent 'when the NFL paid the person to do it'.

Incognito had left Twitter the day the report was published, stating 'Goodbye Twitter. Be well...see you on the other side.'

Indeed, before the report was released, Incognito had fired off an attack on Martin via Twitter, claiming the 'truth is going to bury you and your entire camp. You could have told the truth the entire time'.

However, on publication of the report, Incognito and two teammates were accused of a 'pattern of harassment' aimed at Martin and other young players inside the Dolphin's locker room.

In an abrupt change of tact towards Martin, the Dolphin's lineman said, 'I would like to send Jonathan my apologies as well. Until someone tells me different you are still my brother. No hard feelings.'

Sorry: These are some of the stream of tweets that Richie Incognito sent out on Monday and Tuesday evening to apologize for his angry rant following the publication of Ted Wells' report into bullying at the Miami Dolphins on Friday

And most importantly, Incognito said sorry to Ross and Wells to wrap up his Twitter apologies.

Ted Wells is the New York attorney hired by NFL commissioner Roger Goodell to investigate the staggering claims of abuse from within the Dolphins locker room.

Claiming that 's**t got cray cray', Incognito attempted to repair the damage with his paymaster and investigator.

Justifying his previous ill-tempered rant, Incognito claimed 'There are no winners in the courts. Just families left to deal with their decisions and pick up the pieces. You can't free something. We're all born free.'

Indeed, with his career hanging in the balance, Incognito seems unwilling to let go of the fact that he feels wronged in the whole debacle.

Thanks boss and sorry: Richie Incognito said sorry to Ted Wells and his owner Stephen Ross for accusing the investigation into him of lacking authenticity and thanked Ross for his continuing employment

He retweeted one comment to him from a fan that read, 'Keep your head up brother. There are always 3 sides of a story. His side. Your side and the truth.'

Last week, the investigation into the racially charged Miami Dolphins bullying scandal detailed widespread harassment in the team's locker room that extended beyond the two players at the centre of the probe.

The NFL-ordered report stated there was a 'pattern of harassment' committed by at least three players and extended to two lineman and an assistant trainer, all targets of vicious taunts and racist insults.

Lawyer Ted Wells released the report, saying guard John Jerry and center Mike Pouncey followed Richie Incognito's lead in harassing Jonathan Martin, who left the team in October. They threatened to rape his sister, called him a long list of slurs and bullied him for not being 'black enough'.

Defiant: On Friday Incognito let rip into the report which labelled him one of the chief instigators in a bullying culture within the Miami Dolphin's locker room

Debatable: Incognito also questioned whether the report was impartial as it had been commissioned by the NFL and not an outside adjudicator

In a statement emailed by a league spokesman, the NFL did not make any mention of possible punishment stemming from the case.

The league only confirmed it had received the report and said it appreciated the Dolphins' cooperation with the investigation. Wells said he does not intend to comment further.

Martin is biracial, Incognito is white, and Jerry and Pouncey are black.

Martin's agent Kenneth Zuckerman said his client feels 'vindicated' by the report.

'He feels a great sense of relief,' Zuckerman told The Associated Press. 'Jonathan Martin is a great man and he's only shown me that he is very honest since the day I met him. He loves football and is eager to get back on the field, regardless of what team he plays for.'

Incognito's attorney, Mark Schamel, released a statement calling Wells' report 'replete with errors' and said that Martin 'was never bullied by Richie Incognito or any member of the Dolphins' offensive line.'

Incognito sent a tweet Friday night, saying: 'You could not define me in 144 years let alone 144 pages Mr Wells. Thank you for your hard work and dedication.'

Martin, who has two years left on his contract with the Dolphins, declined interview requests.Incognito was suspended in November, but Pouncey and Jerry remained starters throughout the season.

The report mentioned another offensive lineman and an assistant trainer who also routinely came under attack from the trio. Neither was identified in the report.

The report chronicled Martin's struggle to deal with a 'pattern of harassment', including emotional text exchanges with his parents and a description of him crying in the bathroom after one particularly painful attack.

Martin also told investigators that he 'believed that trying to engage in a physical confrontation with these three - whom he viewed as a united group - would only make matters worse.'

The inquiry said Martin was taunted and ridiculed almost daily. After Martin left the team, Incognito boasted about 'breaking Jmart' in a notebook the linemen used to tally fines and bonuses among themselves.

When the investigation began, Incognito asked another player to destroy the book, saying: 'They're going to suspend me.'

The other harassed player was 'subjected to homophobic name-calling and improper physical touching,' while the assistant trainer, who was born in Japan, was subjected to racial slurs.

'It was not difficult to conclude that the Assistant Trainer and Player A were harassed, but the questions raised in Martin's case were more complex, nuanced and difficult,' the report says.

Although Wells concluded that Martin was abused by three teammates, the report said 'they did not intend to drive Martin from the team or cause him lasting emotional injury.'

Evaluating Martin's claims was difficult, 'given his mental health issues, his possible heightened sensitivity to insults and his unusual, "bipolar" friendship with Incognito,' the report said.

'Nonetheless, we ultimately concluded that Martin was indeed harassed by Incognito, who can fairly be described as the main instigator.'

The report comes about three months after the league hired Wells to investigate the case, which prompted a national debate about hazing and workplace bullying.

'To a great extent, Incognito dictated the culture,' the report said. 'We doubt that matters would have gotten so out of hand had Incognito not set a tone on the offensive line that made extremely vulgar taunting a typical form of communication.'

Dolphins offensive line coach Jim Turner didn't attempt to stop the behavior and even took part in some of the taunting of 'Player A', the report said. Several people interviewed told investigators that Turner gave Player A, a male sex doll as a gag gift around Christmas 2012. Turner told investigators he did not remember the incident, but investigators said they did not believe him.

However, the report found no evidence that the Dolphins front office or head coach Joe Philbin was aware of the conduct Martin found abusive.

The 6-foot-5, 312-pound Martin abruptly left the team on October 28. He was briefly hospitalized and then joined his family in California and underwent counseling for emotional issues. Incognito was barred from the season's last eight games.

Incognito expressed regrets about the racist and profane language he used with Martin, but said it stemmed from a culture of locker-room 'brotherhood', not bullying.

Martin has said he tried to be friends with Incognito. The two players traded more than a thousand text messages in a year's span, and the teasing and vulgar banter went both ways.

Martin also participated in the teasing of Player A, although investigators say he was simply trying to fit in with the other linemen.

The report also mentioned Martin having suicidal thoughts.

'Whether or not Incognito, Jerry and Pouncey fully appreciated the effect of their actions on Martin, there is no doubt that, from Martin's perspective, their actions were abusive and hurtful,' the report said.

'We are not, however, in a position to evaluate Martin's assertion that the abusive conduct of his teammates was, in fact, the exclusive triggering cause of his depression and contemplation of suicide.'

The NFL Players Association said it will review the findings closely, confer with players and all relevant parties involved.

Dolphins owner Stephen Ross said in a statement: 'As an organization, we are committed to a culture of team-first accountability and respect for one another.'
