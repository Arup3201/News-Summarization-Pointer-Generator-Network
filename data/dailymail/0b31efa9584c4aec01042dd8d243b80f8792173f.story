Best friends: To celebrate the launch of the Kate Moss Topshop collection, Nick Grimshaw is the first of many to give an unprecedented glimpse into the supermodel's world

Each film aims to reflect a different side of Kate and with her A list friends sharing their favourite Moss moments.

Radio
 One's breakfast show host Nick Grimshaw talks of the best advice Kate’s
 ever given him, Charlotte Tilbury muses over Kate’s iconic style, 
Amanda Harlech remembers a favourite outfit of Kate’s, Beth Ditto gives 
away Kate’s best model pose and Cara Delevingne reminisces about wanting
 to be like Kate when she was growing up.

Opening up: Nick Grimshaw is one of the stars of Topshop's new films about the life and times of Kate Moss ahead of her collection launching

Shot by acclaimed London-based American artist Leigh Johnson, two films are being aired weekly on Topshop.com in the four weeks running up to the Kate Moss Topshop launch on April 30 - prepare for a stampede.

The first member of Kate's clique to shed some light on the model is Kate's partying partner in crime, Nick Grimshaw.

Speaking about the model's fashion sense, he said: 'Kate's style is always effortless, I don't think she ever looks styled. She always wears what she likes and nails it.

Good times: Sharing the best piece of advice Kate ever gave him, he reminisces: 'We got drunk and decided to have tattoos once and I thought that I really wanted to have Bart Simpson tattooed on me and she stopped that happening'

'She can do things really annoyingly, like wear things that you've already got on and make them look really good and when I put them back on, they immediately look s***,' he laughs.

Offering a rare glimpse into her character, he said: 'She treats everyone the same whether she's hanging out with Donatella Versace or my dad. You get the same Kate Moss.

'She signed a Playboy for my dad for Christmas and that's the proudest my dad's ever been of me. Ever.'

Sharing the best piece of advice Kate ever gave him, he reminisces: 'We got drunk and decided to have tattoos once and I thought that I really wanted to have Bart Simpson tattooed on me and she stopped that happening. 

'The next day she was like "you happy?" and I was like "yes Kate."'

She's one of world's most famous 
supermodels and it's one of the high street's most iconic shops, so news
 of Kate Moss designing once more for Topshop had fashion fans in a 
flurry.

Nick muses: 'I think Kate Moss and Topshop both compliment each other because they are both iconic and not too scary fashion wise.

'Fashion can be quite an intimidating industry for a lot of people, but Kate and Topshop aren't intimidating but they still both manage to be high fashion.'

Beautifier: Charlotte Tilbury, Kate Moss' legendary make-up artist, also shares her musings on the supermodel

Charlotte Tilbury, Kate Moss' legendary make-up artist who also stars in one of the films, added: 'Her incredible library of references has helped her become an amazing designer. She took all these amazing vintage clothes that you so desperately want but she re-modelled them into cool lengths.'

Kate has been teasing fans with a few glimpses of her highly-anticipated new collection.

Yesterday, she was unveiled wearing one of her own outfits on the cover of Vogue's May edition and took us behind the scenes at Topshop to showcase some of her upcoming designs and the inspiration behind them.

Grand reveal: Kate Moss, who last designed for Topshop in 2007, is the star of a new video giving a sneak peek of her upcoming range

Speaking in a video, Kate says: 'The first collection was seven years ago so I've grown up a lot and I learned a lot the first time around.

'This collection is a bit more sophisticated, everything in the collection is something that I would definitely wear and I can't wait to get my hands on it.'

Quick glimpse: The video swiftly flashes to a rail packed with Kate's upcoming designs, which look perfect for festival season

What I wear: Kate explains that all the clothes are things she would wear herself and she can't wait to showcase them

As Kate shares her thoughts on the new range, the camera pans in on her mood board, which features snaps of the model over the years.

Kate revealed that the tasselled waistcoat she is wearing on her Vogue cover was actually inspired by one she owned but lost.

Inside the glossy fashion bible, 
for her second shoot as contributing fashion editor, Kate also styled 
model Freja Beha Erichsen.

Freja wears a
leather waistcoat, chiffon top and shorts - all Kate's own designs for 
Topshop - along with a leather corset from Jitrois.

The
Croydon-born model last worked with the high street brand between 
2007-2010 and her new collection will be sold in 40 
countries this year.

Mood board: Clearly Kate has been putting a lot of effort into her designs and has even taken inspiration from her favourite outfits, as well as her style icons
