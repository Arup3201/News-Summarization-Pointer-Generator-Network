A man hired to repaint a 193-foot super yacht owned by Google founder Larry Page is suing the billionaire on claims he suffered horrific effects from unsafe conditions at the California work site.

Painter James Grupinski claims he was made to work 12-hour days in confined spaces with inadequate ventilation where he was exposed to noxious vapors form fiberglass products provided to him by his employers.

According to court documents obtained by Courthouse News, Grupinski says at one point his employer gave him a highly toxic paint stripper to use, one which had been yanked from store shelved a decade before.

Displeasure boat: Grupinski was hired to repaint thew 193-foot super yacht owned by Google founder Larry Page

Grupinski claims he used the product in unventilated conditions under threat of termination and soon passed out below deck, where he was found  bleeding from the eyes, ears and anus.

When asked to take him to the hospital, his boss, ID'd as Heidi from HF Interior--a company also named in the suit along with one called Modern Mud--then told him to 'drink some milk' and 'stop being a baby' according to the suit.

Per court documents, Grupinski has suffered ever since from seizures, COPD, neurological problems and even early-onset Alzheimer's disease.

Grupinski's attorney did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The yacht has plenty of room for entertaining with a big dining room table and ten bedroom suites

Grupinski is seeking unspecified damages in the personal injury suit.

The massive pleasure boat, for which Page paid $5 million in 2011, first set sail in 1999.

'Senses Georgetown', as it's been dubbed, features a helipad, gym, multi-level sun decks, ten luxurious suites, a crew of 14 and interior design by famed French designer Philippe Starck.

Page, who is worth an estimated $30 billion, bought the boat from New Zealand brewing heir Sir Douglas Meyer. 

Page's toy is actually dwarfed by those owned by other high-tech moguls, such as Paul Allen and Larry Ellison.

Allen's 'Octopus' comes in at 415-ft in length, while Ellison's 'Rising Sun' is 454-ft long, with both costing more than $200m.

The living room is bigger than many New York City apartments and features a projector for movie nights on the high seas

If the jacuzzi is full there is plenty of room for a soak in the deep master bathtub
