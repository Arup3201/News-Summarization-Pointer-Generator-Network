From gun-toting gangster 'Raj' to a middle-aged couple sporting matching pistols, these paper targets are among the more unlikely weapons in the war against terror.

The life-sized cut outs were among the exhibits at an international event showcasing the latest developments in security and surveillance for counter-terrorism experts.

Designed for training armed police officers, the targets all come complete with a paper 'weapon', which can be overlaid with harmless items from a torch to a can of Fosters.

The range of 8000 Series Threat Assessment Targets, produced by Scottish firm McQueen targets,  also include suicide bomber 'Omar', a swordsman holding a woman hostage, and scowling teenager 'Anna'.

Billed as targeting those tasked with 'protecting people and assets from the threat presented by international terrorism', Counter Terror 2013 is attended by police, military and government personnel, as well as intelligence officers and private sector clients.

Target practice: Targets like middle-aged Georgi, left, and this one featuring a man holding a sword to a female hostage's throat, are used to train armed police officers

Other, more hi-tech exhibits at the 
two-day event in London included a reconnaissance 'Throwbot', which can 
be thrown distances of up to 120ft.

From there, it can wheel into enclosed spaces to film terrorists and transmit live video and audio back to the user's handset.

The titanium robot, which costs around £10,000, was one of the most popular items on display at the event.

The Metropolitan Police are understood to have purchased four of the Throwbots ahead of last year's Olympic Games.

Barry Harris, head of international sales at U.S. firm ReconRobotics, told The Independent that police forces in the U.S. were open about their adoption of the technology, but that European clients were more discreet.

'We have good sales in Europe, but clients prefer not to talk about it,' he said.

'China should be a big market... Many places still prefer to kick down doors and take out a target that way.'

Technology: Bullet-proof glass, left, and battery-powered military grade handsets that can be used as a back-up when communication channels break down, right, were among the items on display

Military and Ministry of Defence personnel, representatives from foreign embassies and counter-intelligence officers were all on the list of attendees, along with private sector clients from banks to oil firms.

Easy Jet, Vodafone, and the Post office also appear on the list of pre-registered attendees.

The eclectic list of clientele saw the unveiling of the armoured Cobra 4x4. Built by Canadian firm Streit, the Cobra is the latest model aimed at counter-terror police. Optional extras include a gun turret and a custom-made ladder for climbing into buildings.

Also on display was the Kynamco Magnum Distraction Grenade - capable of being fired through a double-glazed window. Designed for use by police SWAT units, hostage rescue teams use the stun grenades to temporarily paralyse targets.

The latest developments in bullet-proof glass were also on show, alongside battery-powered, military grade handsets capable of providing back-up in the case of a break down of communication channels.

The handsets are ideal for field use for 'on the fly' communication, according to the exhibition organisers.
