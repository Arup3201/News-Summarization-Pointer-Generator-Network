Russia has denied reports that Vladimir Putin is to leave the G20 summit early after a strained 50 minute meeting with David Cameron. 

It was rumoured that the Russian President had decided to head home ahead of schedule following stern words from Mr Cameron during crunch talks  over Ukraine.

But a spokesman for the Kremlin, Dmitry Peskov, took to Russian radio today to deny that the leader was cutting his trip short - insisting he will only leave when the summit is complete.

Vladimir Putin is set to leave the G20 summit early after a strained 50 minute meeting with David Cameron

'The G20 summit will be over tomorrow (Sunday),' Mr Peskov said. 'Putin will certainly leave it, when all the work is completed the president will leave.'

During the robust exchange between Mr Putin and David Cameron, the British Prime Minister was said to have warned him that the Russian's relationship with the west was at a 'crossroads. 

The tense meeting at the summit in Australia, came after the Prime Minister compared Russia to Nazi Germany, saying that they were 'unacceptable'. 

A source in the Russian delegation had earlier said: 'The programme of the second day (Sunday) is changing, it's being cut short.' .

It was suggested that Mr Putin would attend summit sessions on Sunday but would skip an official lunch and address reporters earlier than planned. 

The Telegraph reported that  Mr Cameron told Mr Putin that he was at a 'crossroads' and was risking the nation's relationship with other Western countries.

'I take people as I find them. The sad thing is that to date undertakings given in the Minsk agreement have not been followed but the right thing to do is to continue to engage,' said Mr Cameron.

'So far we haven't seen his actions follow up the statements that he's given on previous occasions.'

'The point is and the reason for meeting is that this issue matters and it's very important Russia understands what's at stake and gets a very clear message,' he said.

'There's a real choice here, there's a different and better way for Russia to behave that could lead to an easing of relations, but at the moment he's not taking that path.' 

Before his  meeting with Putin The Prime Minister said Russia faced a choice, with one option to implement an agreement to allow stability to return to Ukraine free of Moscow's meddling.

'It's important to warn of the dangers if Russia continues to head in the other direction,' Mr Cameron said.

'If that path continues and if that destabilisation gets worse, the rest of the world, Europe, America, Britain, will have no choice but to take further action in terms of sanctions,' he said.

Western leaders have levelled criticism against the Russian hardman, with Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott famously announcing last month he would 'shirtfront' Mr Putin over Russia's support for separatists who allegedly shot down Malaysia Airlines flight MH17, resulting in the deaths of 298 people including 38 Australian citizens and residents.

Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper reportedly told Mr Putin at the Summit, 'I guess I'll shake your hand, but I'll only have one thing to say to you - get out of the Ukraine.' 

There was no immediate comment from the G20's Australian hosts or other delegations.. 

G20 host Tony Abbott went into a week of Asia-Pacific summitry vowing to confront Putin, particularly over the downing of a Malaysia Airlines passenger jet over Ukraine in July. 

In the event, on Saturday, the Australian prime minister was all smiles as he posed for a handshake with a similarly grinning Putin - before the two leaders were photographed holding koala bears together.

However, the koala diplomacy was followed by less cuddly formal talks on the G20 sidelines between Putin and Western leaders including Cameron and French President Francois Hollande.
