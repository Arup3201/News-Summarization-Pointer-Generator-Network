A top model who has appeared as a cover girl for Prada and L'Oreal, has been found dead in her apartment - with two pet dogs also dead nearby.

Czech Katerina Netolicka, 26, was found slumped in her bath at the home she shared with ice-hockey player boyfriend Jakub Petruzalek, 29, in Litvinov, in the north-west of the Czech Republic.

Petruzalek - who has been in a relationship with the model for five years - was out of the country at the time.

The 26-year-old, pictured in a Harper's Bazaar magazine shoot, has been modelling since 2004

He was in Russia, where he plays for ice hockey club Avtomobilist Yekaterinburg. 

The model's body was found by her brother after he became worried when she did not answer his phone calls.

After going to the apartment and failing to get an answer when he knocked, he broke the door down and found the model and her two pet dogs also dead.

The model, who began her career ten years ago, was also known for kick-boxing after winning the Czech Championships last month.

But friends said she was prone to depression and had a history of self-harm.

The model, who celebrated her 26th birthday less than two weeks ago, has modelled for Prada and Elle

A fellow model who lived with her in New York seven years ago who did not want to be named told local media: 'Sometimes she acted like two totally different people lived inside her.

'One minute she was very happy, almost ecstatic. Then sometimes she was depressed and used to self-harm.'

But another friend, Adrian Smrcka, said: 'I really don't know what could have happened.

'Maybe she got a spasm after kickbox training, or maybe it was a stroke.

'I know she had stopped self-harming and was very happy with her boyfriend.' 

Grieving fans and friends have now taken to the model's Facebook page to pay tribute after a post appeared on her timeline saying: 'I'm sorry to let you know this terrible news. Kate has left this world... our thoughts and prayers are with your family and friends.'

The model, who has been working for ten years is also a kick-boxing champion in her home country

John Moustos posted: 'R.I.P Angel Kate. I will really miss you my love.' 

Katka Bundova wrote: 'Sleep sweetly Angel :(.'

Police spokeswoman Lumila Svetlakova said the cause of death is unknown but an autopsy has been requested.

She said: 'The body of young woman was found in Litvinov's district of Hamr.

'The cause of death is at this moment unknown and we have requested an autopsy.'   

Friends said she was prone to depression and had a history of self-harm, but one insisted she was 'happy'
