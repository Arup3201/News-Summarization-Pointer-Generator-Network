Paul Scholes wants England manager Roy Hodgson to throw caution to the wind at the World Cup finals and adopt Liverpool’s cavalier style.

The Manchester United legend believes Hodgson should pick up to five players from his Anfield contingent to avoid a repeat of the turgid performances England produced under Fabio Capello in South Africa four years ago.

Liverpool lost out to Manchester City in the Premier League title race on the last day of the season but were widely praised for their attacking style.

Take it as red: England must play like Liverpool to win the World Cup, says Paul Scholes

Going from strength to strength: Daniel Sturridge will lead the line for England as he does for Liverpool

The fast show: Raheem Sterling will attack with pace and skill with England as he did for Liverpool

Former star: Scholes played 67 times for England between 1997 and 2004, scoring 14 goals including this one against Croatia at Euro 2004

Former United and England midfielder 
Scholes, who went to two World Cups, said: ‘It would be refreshing for 
England to adopt Liverpool’s attacking mentality in Brazil. Really go 
for it. That means certainly four and possibly five Liverpool players 
starting against Italy on June 14.

‘South Africa in 2010 was so 
negative, with boring draws. Nothing seemed to happen. England fans, and
 myself as an England fan, would rather three-all games than dull 0-0 
draws. I’d love to see Roy be brave enough to play like Liverpool. The 
thing I admired most was the swagger of their play and how they 
terrorised opponents. It reminded me of United at their best.

‘The 
reports I’m hearing now from the international set-up are very positive 
and while I  still doubt Roy Hodgson will start with such an attacking, 
 Liverpool-style approach, I’d love to see it.

Middle men: Scholes would like to see Steven Gerrard and Jordan Henderson play in midfield for England

Kneesy does it: Gerrard celebrates scoring the goal to send England to the World Cup

‘Much has been said 
already about the Luis Suarez and Daniel Sturridge partnership for the 
club. But  Steven Gerrard, Sturridge and Raheem Sterling can 
offer a huge goal threat for England. On the back of last season, I’d 
definitely start with Gerrard, Sturridge, Jordan Henderson and Sterling.
 The question mark is Glen Johnson at right back.

‘It’s probably Phil
 Jones’ best position, even though he could still develop into a great 
centre half. Johnson is a touch better going forward, but it’s a tight 
call.

‘Henderson is a diamond of a lad who’s best described as 
workmanlike. He’s a player others appreciate having around them on the 
pitch. He’ll sacrifice himself for the attacking talent.’

Mistake: Scholes says Roy Hodgson was wrong not to pick Michael Carrick

Driving force: Scholes says England have made a mistake not choosing Michael Carrick (left), who has instead been going to events such as the Monaco Grand Prix and meeting the likes of Sebastian Vettel

However, 
Scholes fears Hodgson may have blundered by not including his old United
 team-mate Michael Carrick in the squad to play the ‘quarterback’ role 
if Gerrard suffers an injury.

‘Not bringing Michael Carrick is a  
mistake,’ he said. ‘If there’s an injury to Gerrard nobody jumps out to 
replace him. I don’t see Henderson, Frank  Lampard or Jack Wilshere 
playing  Gerrard’s role. I’m not sure Lampard has the ability to control
 a game. He’s always someone who’s up trying to score goals. England’s 
success in the group hinges on Gerrard staying fit.’

In his blog for
 bookmaker Paddy Power, Scholes also described Yaya Toure’s unhappiness 
at Manchester City over what the Ivory Coast star perceived as the 
club’s failure to respect his 31st birthday as ‘comical’ and ‘quite 
embarrassing’.

He added: ‘I can’t remember United players acting like this. Poor Yaya, maybe the big lad just needs a cuddle.’
