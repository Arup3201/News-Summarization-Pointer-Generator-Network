An enterprising artist has given a whole new meaning to statement jewellery.

While this series of mechanical jewellery on first glance almost looks like Victorian torture instruments, it is in fact designed to 'amplify body language' and 'encourage gesture'.

Created by American designer Jennifer Crupi, the pieces have been created to interpret and force various actions and positions of the body.

Unusual: This quirky jewellery is designed to amplify body language and encourage elegant gestures

Intriguing concept: Created by American designer Jennifer Crupi, the pieces interpret and force various actions and positions of the body

One such position is the 'power gesture' which requires the user to assume the authoritative steepled fingers, or the 'leg bouncer' which focuses on the ubiquitous anxious tick.

The 39-year-old who lives in New Jersey says her work is inspired by people and their body language.

'Part of my interest in body language also stems from the fact that I have always been a very self-conscious person.

'I seem to constantly be aware of how I look and am perceived by others, explained Jennifer.

Believing that jewellery plays a great part in body language and the way people portray themselves to others, Jennifer has created a series called 'Ornamental Hands' which references elegant hand positions often seen in artworks throughout the centuries.

Array of jewellery: The collection consists of prosthetic-like necklaces and neckpieces

She said: 'Rather than wearing a bracelet to adorn your hand, why not wear a bracelet that positions your hand in a decorative and elegant way?

'The marionette-like jewellery also reinforces the idea of training the hand to rest in this graceful manner.'

Jennifer has also created a series called 'Unguarded Gestures' which consists of prosthetic-like necklaces and neckpieces that encourage the wearer to perform varying degrees of open or assertive gestures.
