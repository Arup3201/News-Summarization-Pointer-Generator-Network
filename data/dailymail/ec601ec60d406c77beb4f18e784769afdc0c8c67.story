A young traveller with undiagnosed Crohn's disease woke following an emergency operation to discover part of her bowel had been removed.

Jessica Weatherby had just arrived in New Zealand when she contracted blood poisoning when the disease caused part of her bowel to perforate, causing the contents of her intestinal tract to spill into her abdomen.

The 23-year-old today told of her shock at waking from surgery to discover an ileostomy bag fitted to her stomach, in place of her missing bowel.

Miss Weatherby is now back at home and is learning to live with her life-changing diagnosis.

Jessica Weatherby, 23, woke up from an emergency operation in New Zealand in March, to discover she had an ileostomy bag fitted, after surgeons were forced to remove part of her bowel

She is one of thousands of young people 
in the UK with the condition, as figures from the Health and Social Care
 Information Centre reveal the number of cases in 16 to 29-year-old's 
has rocketed by almost 300 per cent in the last 10 years.

She said: 'Getting used to having an 
ileostomy at the age of 23 was a shock.

'My body has changed in an 
unexpected way and it’s not something you can easily get used to.

'There
 needs to be more awareness about Crohn’s.

'In many ways it’s a young 
person’s disease, because it affects so many children.

'I
 try not to let the diagnosis change my life. It’s frustrating to not be
 able to work while I recover, and it’s important for me to keep busy.

'There is a routine I have to follow - I take around 20 tablets a day and I need to make sure I’m properly stocked with bags.'

Recalling the moment she woke with the ileostomy bag, she said: 'I'd taken myself to the accident and 
emergency department of the local hospital, where I'd been put on 
medication to help me cope with the pain.

'A
 nurse came over and put a mark on my stomach, and mentioned that I 
would have to have an ileostomy. I was delirious so didn’t quite 
appreciate what that meant.

'I
 woke up after the operation, which removed part of my intestine. The 
enormity of what had happened didn’t quite sink in until I had left 
hospital.'

In March, Miss Weatherby, a former sales assistant, travelled 11,000 miles to New Zealand with her boyfriend James Broadbent, 20.

The pair intended to find work and live on the other side of the world for a year.

But their dreams of adventure were shattered just hours after they touched down in Auckland.

Miss
 Weatherby, said: 'I’d been suffering nausea, diarrhoea and insomnia for
 a few weeks before I flew out, but I’d had blood tests and was given 
the all-clear.

Crohn's disease is an incurable and lifelong condition which causes inflammation of part of the bowel

The number of young people admitted 
to hospital with Crohn's disease has soared almost 300 per cent in the 
last 10 years, the BBC reported today.

The Health and Social Care Information Centre said 4,937 16 to 29-year-olds were admitted for treatment in England in 2003/04. Last year that number rose to 19,405.

Experts say junk food and too many antibiotics could be behind the rise.

Dr
 Sally Mitton says she and her colleagues at St George's Hospital in 
Tooting, south-west London, have seen a rise in the number of young 
people with Crohn's.

'We try to keep patients fit enough so they 
can stay at home but because of the increased overall number being 
diagnosed, the actual number needing to be admitted [to hospital] has 
gone up,' she said.

'We know that there are many genes that predispose someone to get Crohn's disease.

'But
 we also know that lifestyle factors like eating a lot of junk food or 
taking many courses of antibiotics may make it more likely to happen.'

The charity Crohn's and Colitis UK says most sufferers find fatigue the hardest symptom to handle or get treatment for.

After four years of research they are launching a new questionnaire to help quantify tiredness.

Professor
 Christine Norton from King's College London led the project. She says 
it will help doctors establish what treatment will work best.

'Young
 people have told us that it really impacts their education, their 
social lives and their ability to get and hold down a job,' she said.

Miss Weatherby was admitted to hospital with blood poisoning after her Crohn's disease caused a perforation in the wall of her bowel, allowing the contents of her intestines to leak into her abdomen

Crohn's disease is a condition that causes inflammation of the digestive system.

Inflammation is the body's reaction to injury or irritation and can cause redness, swelling and pain.

Crohn's disease is one of the two main forms of Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD).The other common form of IBD is Ulcerative Colitis.

Crohn's is described as chronic, meaning it is a life-long condition. Sufferers will have periods of good health, remission, as well as times when their symptoms flare up or relapse.

There is currently no cure for the disease, but drugs and surgery can give patients long periods of relief from their symptoms.

The cause of Crohn's disease is not well understood. Experts believe the condition is, in part, inherited, while an abnormal reaction of the immune system to certain bacteria in the intestines is thought to contribute.

Viruses, bacteria, diet, smoking and stress have all been suggested as environmental triggers, but there is no definitive evidence that any one of these is a cause of Crohn's.

Crohn's causes ulcers to form in the gut and inflammation that affects the body's ability to digest food, absorb nutrients and eliminate waste in a healthy way.

Symptoms include:

Abdominal pain and diarrhoeaTiredness and fatigueFeeling generally unwellMouth ulcersLoss of appetite and weight lossAnaemia - a reduced level of red blood cells

It's estimated around 250,000 people suffer from the condition in the UK. It can start in any age, but usually appears for the first time between the ages of 10 and 40.

The disease can cause complications including perforations. They happen when a severe blockage ruptures the bowel, making a hole. The contents of the bowel can leak through and form an abscess. It causes pain and a fever.

'Once I was out in New Zealand, things only got worse, to the point where I was panicked and constantly crying.'

Miss
 Weatherby attended the emergency department at Blenheim hospital on the
 South Island, where medics at first suspected appendicitis.

She said: 'Once they’d taken the 
appendix out, they realised there was nothing wrong with it. While the 
surgeon was in there he had noticed pus in my abdomen.'

Having
 been diagnosed with Crohn’s disease which had perforated her bowel, she
 was transferred to Nelson hospital where she was prepped for an 
operation to remove part of her intestine.

She said: 'After the operation I was 
put on a high dose of saline fluid, but recovering was a struggle 
because I had developed septicemia.

'I was about to be transferred back 
to the intensive care unit when the word came that the hospital was 
being evacuated because of bad storms. Part of the roof of the ICU had 
actually blown away.

'The 
right side of my heart was failing, my right lung had collapsed and my 
left was filling with fluid. My kidneys function had fallen to 
practically nothing. It was a nightmare.

'James
 and my mother, who had flown over from the UK to be with me, struggled 
to get to the hospital in Wellington where I was transferred to.

'The doctors who were attending to me thought I might die on the flight over.'

She
 was finally transferred to a hospital in Wellington, where she was to 
stay for three weeks, two of which were spent in intensive care. She 
returned to the UK as soon as she was released from hospital.

Today,
 Miss Weatherby, of Manchester, is waiting to hear whether her Crohn’s 
can be brought under control with medication and is hoping for her 
ileostomy to be reversed next year.

She said: 'I
 have started to learn another language and I’m writing a blog about 
what it’s like to be a young woman coping with a condition like this.

'There are thousands of us out there.'
