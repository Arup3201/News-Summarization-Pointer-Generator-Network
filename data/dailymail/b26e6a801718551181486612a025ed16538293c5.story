A stretch of Wales’ highest mountain Mount Snowdon has been put on the market for £7million after a sheep farmer decided to sell up.

Dafydd Morris from Caernarfon, Gwynedd, has decided to give someone else the opportunity to own a 600-acre slice of the picturesque landscape on the northern slopes of the mountain.

The 76-year-old, who still farms the land, bought the area in 1986 and says if it sells he will use the money to buy another farm lower down the mountain after facing difficulties in hill-farming.

Clogwyn Du'r Arddu (pictured) is part of the area for sale and is known as one of the top spots for rock climbing

He told MailOnline: ‘The reason we are selling is because it has become very difficult to farm, especially in the past two years.

‘People were saying they were worried about the environment and they weren’t happy about the way the land was being farmed.

‘So I was thinking of giving them the chance by allowing them to buy the acres.’

Mr Morris said he will not be selling the land to another farmer as he will remain farming on his remaining 600-acres.

‘It will go to someone who wants to look after the environment.

‘People can come there with their children and bring their tents. Schools will be able to come up and see a different area of the mountain.’

Mr Morris, 76, said he is selling as the area has become difficult to farm, particularly in the last two years

The area for sale includes one of Britain’s top rock climbing spots, Clogwyn Du’r Arddu, and a 112-acre space called Cwm Arddu, which is on the market for £2.5million.

Remaining land will be sold off acre-by-acre at a cost of £12,000.

But Mr Morris, the former chairman of the independent Council of the Welsh Highland Shepherds, says he doesn’t mind if there are no takers, as he will carry on as he had done.

‘We just want to give those people that want to take care of the environment the chance to do so and so they can understand what it has been like for hill-farmers.

‘If we make enough money we will buy a farm lower down the mountain but we will also keep our current one.’

John Harold, the director of the Snowdonia Society, told the Independent that he hoped the proposal is ‘motivated by a desire to protect the “iconic landscape, precious mountain habitats, rare wildlife, and the “mountain experience'” rather than the “potential income of £7.5million”.’

The 600-acre area on sale is in the national park (shown on map in relation to north Wales)

He added: ‘Fortunately, much of the land is a National Nature Reserve and nearly all of it is a Site of Special Scientific Interest and a Special Area of Conservation. It is unlikely Snowdon will end up spattered with private glamping sites or such eyesores.’

Agents acting for Mr Morris have created an invite-only website to market the land to limit the number of potential buyers.

It describes the land as ‘one of the wonders of Wales’ and ‘one of the most visited tourist attractions in the UK’.

The advertisement states: ‘A large part of the Snowdon massif is up for sale and Dafydd Morris is calling on all conservationists and the public in general to grasp the opportunity to buy a part of Snowdon to help conserve and cultivate its natural beauty for generations to come.

‘Snowdon or Yr Wyddfa in Welsh is the highest mountain in Wales and is the home to a number of rare plant and bird species including the world renowned Snowdon Lily artic-alpine plant, treasured by the Welsh nation.’

Ownership of Snowdon is shared between the National Trust, the national park authority and a private trust.
