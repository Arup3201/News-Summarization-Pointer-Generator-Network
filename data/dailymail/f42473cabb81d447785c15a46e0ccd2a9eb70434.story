Dismayed shoppers in the spa town of Royal Tunbridge Wells have watched as upmarket superstore Waitrose opened new branches across Kent.

Stores have opened in Edenbridge, Crowborough, Ramsgate and Maidstone while Sevenoaks is preparing for the opening of their second branch.

Even 'downmarket' Tonbridge has their own Waitrose, say angry campaigners.

Dismayed shoppers in Royal Tunbridge Wells have watched for years as branches of Waitrose have popped up all across Kent. Residents have written to the firm urging them to open in the spa town, but to no avail

The small town of Edenbridge, population 8,000, welcomed their new Waitrose last month.

Meanwhile the 56,500 well-to-do residents of Tunbridge Wells are left facing an eight-mile round trip to their nearest branch.

Locals have mounted a campaign, writing to Waitrose to demand it opens a store in the spa town.

Richard Shaw, 52, said: 'Every time 
there is a whisper about a new shop coming to town, everyone gets their 
knickers in a twist thinking it will be Waitrose.

'We've waited long enough, I think it's time the store just did the decent thing and opened a store here.'

And Sarah Reed, 42, added: 'I've lived her for my entire life and
 have seen Waitrose shops pop up all over the county - but never 
anything for Tunbridge Wells.

'It's
 very, very odd - the people here tend to be quite well off and 
discerning, exactly the type of customers Waitrose should be aiming at, 
but we don't get a look in.

'Even Dartford and Tonbridge have got one and now Sevenoaks will have two - it's very galling.'

She said she had written to Waitrose 
detailing other stores around the county which had opened and 'politely 
requesting' they look at Tunbridge Wells.

Local resident Anke, the voice behind The Royal Tunbridge Wells blog, which was launched in 2005, has spent years questioning whether Waitrose will grace the town with their presence.

In 2005 he complained the company was 'making us trek to the next town to buy groceries'.

A recent post said: 'We have reason for celebration this week, well if you're a shopper that is.

'No,
 calm down, Waitrose hasn't arrived yet, but our main shopping centre 
has won the prestigious award of "Best Shopping Centre in the World".'

A Waitrose spokesman said last week: 'I can assure you we're still keen to bring a Waitrose to Tunbridge Wells, however have nothing further to update at the moment.'
