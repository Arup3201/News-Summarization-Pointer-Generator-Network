ISIS is plotting to smuggle militants into Western Europe disguised as refugees so that they can launch devastating terror attacks, according to US intelligence sources.

Encrypted communications unravelled by American military intelligence have revealed that Islamic State leaders are planning to take advantage of the 'chaotic conditions' on the Syria-Turkey crossing.

Relaxed border controls would allow IS militants to blend in with the thousands of genuine refugees spilling over the border in search of safety, reports International Business Times.

Hundreds of Kurdish refugees cross the Syria-Turkey border every day as they flee to safety - now ISIS plans to disguise its militants as refugees in the hope that they can eventually infiltrate Western Europe

The Trojan Horse tactic would see fighters equipped with fake passports, leaving them free to travel around European countries and plot terrorist attacks unchecked. 

A US intelligence source, speaking to German newspaper Bild,  said that ISIS was moving away from plans to conduct aircraft hijackings  for fear of tight security - and that they were looking to land a new strategy.

'In view of the chaotic conditions on the Syria-Turkey border, it is nearly impossible to catch Isis terrorists in the wave of refugees,' wrote Bild.

Because hundreds of refugees cross the Syrian-Turkish border every day, the jihadists have a good chance of remaining unnoticed in the crowds.

Turkey is also used by jihadists who want to join ISIS in Syria, as they do not require a visa to get there. 

They go on vacations as tourists and upon arrival have almost no trouble finding a way to cross the border.

The discovery by US intelligence comes as the Syrian border city of Kobane continues to to bear the brunt of an ISIS offensive.

Militants raised their flag over a building in the outskirts of the town this morning following an assault lasting almost three weeks, amid fears the town could fall to the jihadists within hours. 

A black flag belonging to ISIS was visible from across the Turkish border atop a four-storey building close to the scene of some of the most intense clashes in recent days.

Despite the symbolic raising of the flag, the town's brave Kurdish defenders said the terrorists had not reached Kobane city centre and would not be allowed to do so 'for as long as we live'.

Local sources inside Kobane confirmed the group had planted its flag but said that Kurdish forces had repelled their advances so far. 

At least 20 ISIS militants have so far been killed in their assault on the city today - following the deaths of more than 45 fighters on each side yesterday.

Kobane is a town of key strategic importance to both ISIS and the Kurdish resistance due to its close proximity to the largely porous Turkish border. 

While the city centre is roughly six miles from the barbed wire fence that separates Turkey from Syria, the city's northern suburbs are so close to Turkey that civilians in the Turkish town of Mursitpinar have been able to watch the fighting with binoculars.

This morning Kurdish fighters inside Kobane - which is also known as Ayn al-Arab and situated right on the Turkish border - declared that U.S.-led airstrikes against ISIS targets in northern Syria have had little impact on the militant group, who have continued to seize swathes of territory

On the Turkish side of the border at least 14 Turkish army tanks took up positions on a hilltop near Kobane

Since the ISIS offensive on the areas surrounding Kobane began, approximately 160,000 civilians - mainly Syrian Kurds - have fled across the border into Turkey.

There are fears ISIS will embark on another mass slaughter - as it did with the Yazidi Kurds in the Iraqi town of Sinjar - if it captures Kobane. Despite the mass exodus into Turkish territory, 100,000 people remain in the city.

Esmat al-Sheikh, head of the Kobani Defence Authority, said: 'If they enter, it will be a graveyard for us and for them. We either win or die. We will resist to the end.' 

On the Turkish side of the border, at least 14 Turkish army tanks took up defensive positions on a hilltop near Kobane.
