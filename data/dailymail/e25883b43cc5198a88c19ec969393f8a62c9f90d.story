The University of Pennsylvania has been named America's top party school by Playboy in the first time the Ivy League institution has made the list.

Believe it or not the magazine gave the top spot to the college by declaring that 'UPenn puts other Ivies to shame with its union of brains, brewskies and bros.'

In the magazine's ninth annual ranking of universities around the country, the University of Wisconsin-Madison scored the runner up slot.

Syracuse University, this year's top party school according to the Princeton Review, was placed at No. 10 by Playboy for the 2014 countdown. 

Last year's winner West Virginia University slipped down to third place.

Playboy writes: 'Boasting a notorious underground frat scene that school officials have deemed a nuisance, these renegades pony up thousands of dollars' worth of liquor for their parties—and competition among the houses means a balls-out war of debauchery.

'Aboveground, casual sex is rampant, as coeds value careers over coupling. 

'Philly's boisterous bar scene keeps off-campus-carousing options numerous. 

'School-sponsored day drinking hits a high note during Spring Fling, an outdoor music fest that pulls in acts such as Passion Pit, Tyga and Janelle Monáe and turns the Quad into a sloshed mosh pit.'

UPenn been in the press recently for their antics - in April the women's lacrosse team allegedly ran riot in a Philadelphia Irish pub  - stealing liquor, smoking marijuana in the bathrooms and flashing their private parts 'to the adulation of the rest of the party'.

Local managers in City Center met to discuss actually banning UPenn students from their bars.

This year's list was determined by Playboy's editors who considered a variety of factors in their selection process, including access to nightlife and musical events, and creativity when planning social gatherings. 

Information from the National Center for Education Statistics, the NCAA, and the US Economic Census was also considered.

In addition to its Top 10 rankings, Playboy also honored Vassar College for having the 'Coolest Indie Music Scene' and Oberlin College for being the 'Sexiest Small School.'

Playboy last published its Top Party Schools list in its October 2013 issue with West Virginia University crowned as number one. 

The magazine's first list, Top 40 Party Colleges, appeared in its January 1987 issue with California State University-Chico taking the top spot.
