A six-year-old boy with a rare neurological condition has completed a triathlon thanks to an incredible show of love from his big brother.

Lucas Aldrich, who is unable to walk or talk, was pulled in a dinghy, pushed in a wheelchair and tugged along by a bike driven his eight-year-old brother Noah at a children's triathlon last week.

The boys, from Boise, Indiana, took part in the race after Noah said he wanted to complete it alongside his brother - his best friend.

'They definitely have a special bond, the
 two of them,' their father, Brian, told KTVB. 'You see Lucas light up so much when Noah
 enters the room. It just brings a smile to your face when you see the 
love between the boys.'

Noah said he loves going on walks and watching television with his little brother, who has a rare neurological condition called lissencephaly.

'I like everything about him, he's perfect,' Noah said.

The family like to stay active and give Lucas the best experiences in life - from skiing to plane rides to trips to Disney World. Recently, they heard about a YMCA Kids Club Program - and a kids' triathlon.

Noah said he wanted to get involved.

'He said, 
"Mom, I want to do this with my brother",' their mother, Alissa, said. 'That's where the 
idea was born and I think the next day we started training.'

Fighter: Noah suggested competing in the race with his little brother, who has a rare neurological disorder

For three months, they trained in running - with Noah pushing Lucas in a large stroller - and swimming - with Lucas in a boat pulled along by Noah - and cycling, with Lucas in a stroller on the back of his brother's bike.

The triathlon consisted of 200 meters swimming, three miles cycling and one mile running.

On the big day, Noah admitted that he was nervous - but he put in an astonishing effort and carried his brother across the finish line as spectators cheered.

They completed the race in just over 54 minutes, JRN reported.

'It was really exciting to watch them and
 a little nerve wracking as parents, but they did so good and we're 
proud of them,' Alissa said.

Lucas was born with lissencephaly, which means he is missing the normal folds and wrinkles in the cerebral cortex, according to the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke.

Best friends: Noah called his younger brother, who cannot walk or talk or eat on his own, 'perfect'

It occurs in only one in 85,470 births and can cause seizures, difficulty swallowing and other serious health problems, as well as a shortened life span, according to The Cortical Foundation.

Mrs Aldrich told Today.com that she had a normal pregnancy, but that Lucas started to cry for hours on end when he was three months old. He had an MRI, which revealed the disorder.

'He can't walk, he can't talk, but heâ€™s the happiest little guy you can ever imagine and he just loves being around people,' she said.

The family 
have launched a non-profit organization called Lucas House, which helps 
parents with special needs children and provides the kids with pet therapy, 
music therapy and arts and crafts.
