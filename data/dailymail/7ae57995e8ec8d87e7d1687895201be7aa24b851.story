A pair of Scottish pranksters staged a fight in front of a famous Edinburgh monument when a Google Street View camera car passed by.

The two young men can be seen having a fist fight on Princes Street next to the city's famous Scott Monument, in images captured by Google at the end of July this year. 

But council chiefs said they were 'disappointed' that Google had used the images, saying it looked like 'a homage' to cult movie Trainspotting.

The two men were caught on Google Street View staging a fight outside the Scott Monument in Edinburgh

City Centre councillor Joanna Mowat said: 'It is disappointing that Google have chosen to use a picture which appears to be staged as some sort of homage to Trainspotting rather than an image that better reflects the true nature of Edinburgh's Princes Street.

'It is a safe city centre with probably the best skyline in the world.'

In the pictures a tall man in jeans and a grey t-shirt has his hand around the neck of a shorter man with blonde hair, wearing glasses, a purple t-shirt and jeans.

The shorter man appears to be trying to punch the other man.

In images taken further along the street in the direction of Waverley Station, the two men are seen standing in Princes Street Gardens waving their hands in the air while facing the Google van. 

The men were also seen in the gardens waving their hands in the air after appearing to spot the Google car

And as the camera moves west along the street the man are seen walking closer to the scene of the fracas.

Once the camera goes past the scene of their staged fight, the man can be seen with their arms down, walking back towards where they originally came from.

A spokesman for Google said they did not wish to comment on the images.
