This is the giant festive treat that combines a burger with an entire Christmas dinner. 

The monster creation features a 14oz beef burger, 10oz of smoked turkey, two bacon-wrapped chipolatas, homemade stuffing, cranberry sauce and gravy, sandwiched between a brioche roll and served with a side of chips.

The 2,000-calorie Feast On A Beast is the brainchild of  Eddy and Kate Weights who run the Brass Pig Barbecue Cafe in Southport, Merseyside.

The Feast on a Beast burger contains a 14oz beef patty, 10oz of smoked turkey, stuffing, cranberry sauce and gravy sandwiched between a brioche bun and topped with two pigs in blankets

The £12 burger is part of their festive menu, which also features the 'ultimate pig in a blanket dish'. 

The other highlight is a 1,600-calorie, £7 deep-fried seven-inch hot dog wrapped in bacon, with stuffing, gravy and cranberry sauce on top.

The couple, who have been married for 18 months, opened the restaurant in September and are well-known in the area for their epic meat dishes.  

Mr Weights said: 'We opened up here more than three months ago now and we're determined to make dishes that customers will remember.

'The Feast on a Beast was something we came up with when planning ahead for Christmas.

'It's completely home-made and features all of the typical Christmas dinner foods including turkey and pigs in blankets along with an enormous juicy beef burger.

'Burgers are probably the most popular dish here so we decided to get festive and it's proving to be a real hit.

'The hot dog is more of a twist on pigs in blankets and is definitely suited to those with a slightly smaller appetite.

Eddy said: 'We're always open to suggestions from customers - especially when it comes to themed burgers like this one.

'Nothing beats proper home cooked food so having these sort of dishes combined is always very well received.

'We've got a load of bookings at the restaurant for the run up to Christmas so I'm pretty confident that we'll be selling loads of them in the next few weeks.

'It's brilliant because we're quite well-known in the area so hopefully we can keep coming up with more spectacular ideas.' 

The restaurant has served a roast beef burger in the past.
