Armed robbers stole watches worth thousands of pounds after holding terrified staff at a hotel boutique at gunpoint in a raid that detectives fear may be the work of a notorious criminal gang.

Thieves threatened staff at the Hyatt Regency Palais de la Mediterranee hotel on the upmarket Promenade des Anglais in Nice shortly after 7am this morning.

The gang targeted watches which were displayed in a reinforced case next to the hotel's jewellery boutique.

Police are exploring the possibility 
that the heist could be linked to the Pink Panther gang made up of 
ex-soldiers from places like Serbia and Ukraine.

The
gang has been targeting jewellery collections for almost 15 years, 
stealing up 330 million pounds worth, often from Riviera resorts like 
Nice and Cannes.

A
police spokesman said that the robbers left the scene on scooters and 
that the value of their haul has not yet been calculated.

The
robbery is the latest in a long list of raids which have targeted the 
upmarket hotels and shops on the seafront around resorts like Nice.

Police are linking the heist to a series of other robberies on the French Riviera which they are connecting with the Pink Panther gang. The Carlton hotel in Cannes, pictured, was targeted last month

The
authorities in nearby Cannes pledged to tighten security last month 
following a record-breaking raid at the world-famous Carlton Hotel, 
which is a favourite of Hollywood stars ranging from Elizabeth Taylor to
Angelina Jolie.

A lone gunman wearing a crash helmet 
and scarf to cover his face walked into the hotel on a Sunday lunchtime 
before brandishing his pistol at staff.

He
walked into a bedroom where £90 million worth of diamonds and 
jewellery-encrusted watches were stored and tipped the valuables into a 
briefcase before escaping through a set of French windows.

Cannes is renowned for its jewellery thefts – many of which take place during its annual film festival in May.

A Cannes Kronometry luxury watch store was also raided in July.

Police are exploring a possible link with the heists and the escape of a member of the notorious Pink Panther organised crime gang.

 Milan Poparic was released from a Swiss jail by accomplices brandishing AK-47 automatic rifles, making the third Pink Panther to have got out of prison in as many months.

The gang are said to be able to ‘launder’ stolen jewels in eastern Europe after driving them overland from the places where they were stolen.

Police and hotel staff in French hotels frequently complain that jewellery firms frequently place minimum security around their stock.
