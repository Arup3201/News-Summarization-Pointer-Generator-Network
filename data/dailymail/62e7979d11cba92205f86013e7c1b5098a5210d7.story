England have been putting together their final preparations during the captain's run at Twickenham as they ready themselves to face the might of the All Blacks on Saturday.

The entire squad were in action in training on Friday, among them Owen Farrell and debutant Semesa Rokoduguni, as boss Stuart Lancaster laid his final plans for their clash against the best side in the world.

And Lancaster will be hoping to avenge the series whitewash England suffered when they toured New Zealand in June, losing all three tests and conceding 94 points.

And World Cup-winning captain Martin Johnson believes that England face a formidable challenge against the mighty All Blacks on Saturday.

'If England can beat the All Blacks at any time it's a big thing but it's tough to play them in the first game,' said Johnson, who also led England as manager during the 2011 World Cup.

'England haven't played together for a long time, compared to them. That's their advantage. You've just got to go out and get used to the intensity of Test matches pretty quickly.

'They are always good and the more you can be exposed to playing against them the better it is.'

'As a team, all you can do is go out and try and play as well as you can. Against the All Blacks, that might not be good enough because they're exceptional.

'Like any team, if we play at our absolute best, we will be in with a shout against anyone, particularly at Twickenham. And then it's about finishing.'
