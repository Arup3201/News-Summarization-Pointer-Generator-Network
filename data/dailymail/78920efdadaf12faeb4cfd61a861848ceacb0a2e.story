Flying remote-controlled model planes might seem a harmless pastime, enjoyed in parks across the country.

But police fear some of those practising the hobby could be terrorists training for an attack.

An army of model aircraft enthusiasts has been enlisted to help root out anyone using the activity as cover for sinister plots.

Cover up? The British Model Flying Association has been asked to look out for members using the hobby as a front for plotting sinister crimes

Counter-terror officers have spoken to the British Model Flying Association to urge its 36,000 members to look out for suspicious behaviour while enjoying their hobby in public spaces.

Security chiefs are concerned extremists will use remote-controlled aircraft packed with explosives to attack buildings, causing death and destruction.

Model planes can also be fitted with cheap digital cameras to record video footage as they fly past – potentially providing terrorists with invaluable intelligence.

The alert follows a meeting between the Special Branch Counter-Terrorism Unit and officials from the British Model Flying Association (BMFA), the national governing body for model aircraft buffs, which dates back to 1922.

The organisation agreed to ask its members to ‘increase vigilance for any signs of potential criminal or terrorist activity arising from the use of model aircraft’.

An article in the BMFA News, the association’s magazine, said: ‘This is part of regional and national initiatives introduced by the Counter-Terrorism Unit aimed at gaining enhanced vigilance from those involved in all aspects of aviation.’

Dave Phipps, chief executive of the BMFA, which is based in Leicester, said: ‘We want members to come to us if they have any concerns about anyone they see with a model plane who does not seem quite right, if they ring any alarm bells.

‘Some of the people involved in  the September 11 attacks had trained on aircraft simulators which rang some alarm bells, but no one said anything.’

In Germany, police raids have foiled plots to use planes large enough to carry explosive to destroy buildings, while in London model planes were banned from the skies during the Olympics (file picture)

Anti-terror officers believe there is a real threat from rogue model aircraft flyers. Last year, police in Germany foiled an Islamist terror plot intending to use remote-controlled model planes filled with explosives flown into targets.

In June 2013, armed officers from the specialist G9G units raided homes in Stuttgart, Munich and Dachau after receiving information that at least one assassination attempt was being planned using the model aircraft as guided missiles.

Prosecutors said the arrests were linked to a plot centred on Islamist ‘holy war’.

It was reported that model aircraft, some of which are powerful and big enough to carry explosives capable of destroying a commercial building, were seized in the swoop.

And in 2012, an American man was jailed for 17 years for plotting to fly model planes carrying explosives into the Pentagon and the US Capitol in Washington.

Spanish police have also released a video allegedly showing Al Qaeda members training for a bombing raid using a miniature plane.

Model aircraft were banned from the skies over London as part of the security crackdown during the Olympics.

Counter-terror chiefs feared extremists could use remote-controlled drones to launch attacks on packed sporting venues.

Under restrictions aimed at foiling a terror attack, enthusiasts were  not allowed to operate remote-controlled aeroplanes and helicopters weighing more than 7kg over  the capital.
