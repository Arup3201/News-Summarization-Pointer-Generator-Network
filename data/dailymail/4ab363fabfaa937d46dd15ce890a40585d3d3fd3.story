Aviation authorities are investigating a serious incident at Dublin Airport in which a Ryanair plane taxied the wrong way down a runway on which other planes were about to land.

Ryanair flight FR227, from ­London Stansted to Dublin, missed its exit and made a 180-degree turn at the end of the runway, before heading back the way it had come – causing other flights to abort or delay landings, the Irish Mail on Sunday can reveal.

Dramatic recordings of Air Traffic Control communications, which have been heard by the MoS, describe how the Ryanair flight had to ‘brake hard’. Other planes were ordered ‘go around’.

Incident: A Ryanair plane caused huge disruption at Dublin airport after it missed its exit and taxied the wrong way down a runway other flights were about to land on

The Irish Aviation Authority is investigating the incident, in which FR227 attempted another unauthorised turn before being directed onto another exit.

After the incident, another Ryanair plane, EI-DWR, addressed as Three Whiskey Romeo, asks the tower: ‘What was wrong with the runway?’

The control tower replies: ‘Well what happened was one of your company aircraft landed on runway 28, appeared to be going to the very end of the runway and just before they got to Bravo 7 [a runway exit], they made a 180 degree turn which, eh, just screwed every­thing.’

A statement from the IAA revealed that the incident was being treated seriously.

‘The Irish Aviation Authority is investigating an incident at Dublin Airport on February 15 where an aircraft that landed and was cleared to vacate the runway, completed a 180 degree turn back down the runway,’ said a spokesman.

‘There were other aircraft on approach to land on this runway, which were being monitored by air traffic control and as the other aircraft was still on the runway these aircraft were instructed to perform a missed approach.’

The authority said that an investigation was an ‘entirely normal procedure’ in such circumstances ‘to avoid any safety issues arising for passengers or aircraft’.

The statement continues: ‘Prior to any further landings, an inspection of the runway was conducted by the airport authority to ensure the runway was available for use. This again is a normal procedure. Shortly thereafter, the runway was reopened and operations resumed.’

Ryanair confirmed that it was aware of the incident. A spokesman said: ‘This incident was reported by Ryanair to the IAA and we are co-operating fully with their enquiries. We have nothing further to add to the IAA statement.’

On the recordings, the control tower is heard instructing an Aer Lingus flight from Paris: ‘529, you’re going to have to go around too. The runway has to be inspected and if you can maintain present heading please and maintain 2,000ft.’

In the incident, FR-227 had been cleared to land on Runway 28.

After landing, air traffic control called the crew and requested they ‘expedite vacating the runway’ which the crew acknowledged.

Almost immediately, the incredulous­-sounding controller asked the crew: ‘227, have you made a 180?’. The response from the crew was: ‘Affirm.’

The controller immediately alerted the next incoming aircraft, Aer Lingus flight EI-249 from London Gatwick, telling it: ‘Go around.’

Serious incident: An Aer Lingus plane was forced to abort its landing when it was less than a minute from touchdown and fly around Dublin airport to come in from another approach

The Aer Lingus plane – about to land on Runway 28, where FR-227 was now taxiing the wrong way – aborted its landing and flew around the airport to come in for another approach. While Aer Lingus flight EI-249 had not been cleared to land, the flight was less than a minute from touchdown when the crew was forced to abort.

The controller also advised the crew of the next inbound flight, Aer Lingus EI-627 from Copenhagen: ‘Possible go-around now, traffic has made a 180 on the runway.’

Ryanair 227 then called the tower to advise it they were turning off at taxiway Echo 7.

The tower controller told the pilot: ‘No, you can’t make that turn. You’ve got to all the way down the runway to Echo 5.

This meant that the Ryanair jet had to travel almost halfway back down the 2.6km runway. No other aircraft could land or take off until the aircraft had cleared the runway.

Soon afterwards, the controller confirmed to flight EI-627 that it too would have to abort its landing and go around. The tower next made several attempts at finding out from Ryanair 227 exactly why it had made the unauthorised 180-degree turn rather than continue to the end of the runway and exit at Bravo 7.

Statement: A Ryanair spokesman confirmed the company was aware of the incident and is co-operating with the investigation

The crew explained they’d had issues with the landing and had had to brake hard.

An airport rescue vehicle carried out an inspection for rubber or debris left on the runway after the hard braking and to see whether any runway lights had been broken.

Several other incoming Ryanair and Aer Lingus flights were told to break off their approaches and enter holding patterns over the Irish Sea for several minutes until this had been completed.

The runway was quickly inspected and cleared to allow landings to recommence.

While the runway was effectively closed for less than 15 minutes, a total of eight flights were affected.It’s likely that the incident cost both Ryanair and Aer Lingus thousands of euro in extra fuel. Hundreds of passengers were delayed.

Ryanair came under fire late last year after three of its planes made emergency landings in Valencia, Spain, in just one day.

The criticism prompted outspoken boss Michael O’Leary to defend the budget airline, claiming its safety record over its 28-year history was ‘impeccable’.
