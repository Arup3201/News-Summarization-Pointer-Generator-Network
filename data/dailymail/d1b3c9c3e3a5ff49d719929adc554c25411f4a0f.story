A feline described as ‘the world’s saddest cat’ has found a new home after she was put up for adoption, it was revealed today.

Tucker, a one-year-old cat with an unusual appearance due to genetic abnormalities, was taken to the Purrfect Pals cat shelter in Arlington, Washington, after her owners no longer wanted to keep her.

She suffers from an auto-immune disease making her skin very thin and easy to bruise. The cat also has hair loss because of scabs that she pulls off - and is therefore dressed in T-shirts to prevent this.

Put up for adoption: Tucker is a one-year-old cat with an unusual appearance due to genetic abnormalities

Problems: She suffers from an auto-immune disease making her skin very thin and easy to bruise

Tucker is said by animal workers to 
enjoy sitting on laps and playing with string toys, as well as being 
petted under the chin and behind the ears – and especially likes being 
around children.

And after a media campaign that 
attracted attention on both sides of the Atlantic, workers at the centre
 were swamped with requests from people around the world who wanted to 
adopt her.

Now, she has been given to a woman 
known only as ‘Katie’, who works at a vet clinic and already has 
experience of caring for special-needs kittens with her husband.

The couple already have a cat called 
Poe with many of the same problems faced by Tucker - whose story was 
first published by media outlets about a month ago.

A Purrfect Pals spokesman said today: ‘Katie works at a vet clinic and she and her husband have plenty of experience caring for special needs kitties.

'We couldn't dream of a better match for Tucker'

‘They actually already have a cat, Poe, with many of the same symptoms that Tucker has. His skin bruises and tears very easily and he also has similar leg deformities.

‘Katie has protective outfits custom made for Poe and their house is already been kitty-proofed with his special needs in mind. We couldn't dream of a better match for Tucker.’

Purrfect Pals has been taking in cats in Washington state for more than 25 years, and currently has space for up to 225 cats. It also houses a further 250 cats in foster care.
