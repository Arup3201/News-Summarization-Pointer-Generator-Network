A farmer who knocked down his neighbour in his tractor in the culmination of a three-year feud over access to his property has walked free from court.

Frank Ainsworth, 64, was accused of deliberately trying to mow down Colin MacDiarmid, a policeman, after spotting him digging holes in a gravelled lane next to his cottage.

The 43-year-old sergeant claimed the sheep farmer had threatened to ‘drive over him’ if he didn’t stop what he was doing. It came after as many as 20 incidents were reported to police amid a dispute over access to Mr Ainsworth’s remote farm.

A court heard that the farmer accused his police officer  of digging holes at the side of the gravelled lane in the rural Turn Hill area of Rossendale, Lancashire

The tractor caught Sergeant MacDiarmid’s leg at what he claimed was 20mph before crushing his wheelbarrow.

Mr Ainsworth insisted that he had simply failed to spot his neighbour as it was getting dark but he was brought before court this week to face charges of assault and criminal damage to the £50 wheelbarrow.

However, the officer was not present after being seconded to Cardiff ahead of next week’s Nato conference. Magistrates insisted that the case go ahead and the prosecution was forced to offer no evidence.

The farmer maintained that the collision had been an accident and described the prosecution as a ‘phenomenal’ waste of everyone’s time. Mr Ainsworth, who was awarded his costs, said he had reported Sgt MacDiarmid to the Independent Police Complaints Commission over his conduct.

He claimed that his 25-year-old tractor would have struggled to reach 20mph ‘going downhill’ even in top gear.

‘This has been a phenomenal amount of police time and a waste of taxpayers’ cash,’ he said. ‘As regards his injury, I have had worst grazes on my hands catching sheep.

‘I was doing 5mph on my tractor and he was digging in the road in the dark – I simply didn’t know he was there.’

Details of the fracas last February emerged as Mr Ainsworth appeared at Burnley Magistrates’ Court.

The farmer, who has reared sheep on a hillside near Rossendale, Lancashire, for three decades, sold cottages on his farmland with conditions that buyers sign covenants granting him right of way to get to his farm, the court heard.

But trouble began around three years ago after Sgt MacDiarmid, an officer with Greater Manchester Police for 17 years, and his wife moved into one of the cottages with their twin daughters.

Sarah Johnson, prosecuting, said the altercation followed a verbal dispute during which Mr Ainsworth – who was on a quad bike – was said to have threatened to drive his tractor over Sgt MacDiarmid.

After the officer warned him he would be committing a criminal offence the farmer was alleged to have said: ‘I don’t give a f***.’

The farmer drove off but returned soon after in his tractor and the collision occurred.

Nick Dearing, defending Mr Ainsworth, said: ‘This was not a serious injury – more similar to an injury sustained in rugby practice. At the end of the day this is a trial with a broken wheelbarrow and a graze.

‘He maintains it was an accident down a narrow dark lane late at night and without any malice.’

Sgt MacDiarmid, who was commended in 2011 for his role in rescuing a girl who fell from a 150ft viaduct, has since moved out of the cottage. He was unavailable for comment.

The prosecution blamed his absence on an ‘admin error’.
