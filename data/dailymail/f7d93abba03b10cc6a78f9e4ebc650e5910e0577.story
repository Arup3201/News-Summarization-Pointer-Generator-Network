Gareth Bale became the world's most expensive footballer when he signed for Real Madrid last summer - but is Nemanja Vidic trying to tempt the Welshman to join him in Italy?

The pair were pictured talking after Inter Milan's victory on penalties on Saturday in California, with Vidic appearing to be pointing and giving Bale advice - possibly that he should sign for Inter.

The former Manchester United centre-back had just witnessed Bale score a stunning solo goal against his side as the International Champions Cup match finished 1-1 after normal time.

It took just 10 minutes for Bale to open his pre-season account as he burst through Inter's midfielder and unleashed a rocket of a left-foot shot beyond Samir Handanovic.

He had already hit the bar after three minutes with a header at the California Memorial Stadium in Berkley, California.

Mauro Icardi levelled the match from the spot in the 68th minute before Inter triumphed 3-2 on penalties.
