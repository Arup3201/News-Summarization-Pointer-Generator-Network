As severe storms ripped through Brisbane, drenching the city in record amounts of rain - some locals decided to make the most of the wild weather.

One man decided he wouldn't let torrential rain dampen his spirits and took the opportunity to fit some extra swimming practise in.

Footage shows him laying flat on his stomach on the ground at Queen Street Mall in Brisbane as the rain pours down around him.

One man used the Brisbane storm as an excuse to get some extra swimming practise in

He lay down on the ground at at Queen Street Mall in Brisbane during the huge storm on Wednesday

He rolls over onto his back and begins to slide himself along the ground in a backstroke motion, wearing only a pair of board shorts.

The swimmer completes a few stokes before turning round and heading back in the other direction.

He travels a few more metres before he jumps up and runs for cover from the horrible weather despite already being soaked to the bone.

The hilarious stunt was filmed from a level above the ground-level strip, presumably out of the reach of the torrential rain. 

He then turned around in his makeshift pool and started to head in the other direction

The severe storm caused flooding and chaos around the whole city 

On Wednesday evening the weather caused significant delays  across Brisbane's rail network after severe storm damage and flash flooding.

Up to 100mm of rain fell in less than hour in some parts of the city late on Wednesday afternoon, with the southwestern suburbs among the hardest hit.

Emergency services had received around 250 calls for assistance by 9.30pm - more than 90 from within the Brisbane city area.

Cars were submerged and swept away by the flash floods that swallowed the city

'Some of the worst hit areas were Redbank Plains, Forest Lake, Inala and Springfield,' a Queensland Fire and Emergency Services spokeswoman said.

Images posted on social media show cars being swept away in Bowen Hills, in inner Brisbane, as well as Chermside and Fortitude Valley. 

There were also pictures of water pouring into Post Office Square in the CBD, and through the roof of Toombul Shopping Centre.

Rescue teams were called to Rocklea and Salisbury amid reports people were trapped in flooded cars, but they managed to escape by the time crews arrived.

Fallen trees, powerlines and water over roads and rail lines caused chaos during peak-hour for commuters heading in and out of the CBD.

The Bureau of Meteorology had warned that Brisbane would experience severe thunderstorms, damaging winds and large hailstones

Trains were suspended between Bowen Hills and Geebung and Shorncliffe stations with buses replacing them. There were lengthy delays well into the night. 

'Our teams will continue to work through the night to restore services for our customers, but given the severity of the damage we do expect that some services may continue to be affected tomorrow morning,' Queensland Rail posted on Facebook.

At 10pm, Energex said around 3000 Queensland homes were without power - just over 1000 within the Brisbane city area.

The Bureau of Meteorology warned on Wednesday afternoon of the severe thunderstorm, saying it could produce damaging winds and large hailstones.

Inala, in Brisbane's southwest, was pummelled with 100mm of rain in 60 minutes, according to the bureau. A gust of 106km/h was also recorded at Redcliffe just after 5pm. 

A second severe thunderstorm warning for later in the evening has since been cancelled.

Further south in New South Wales temperatures are set to soar above 30 degrees this coming weekend.

In Sydney on Friday a high of 35 is forecast, on Saturday it will dip a little to 28 and on Sunday temperatures will soar to 34 again.

This comes as the Bureau of Meteorology has predicted an El Nino weather pattern to strike Australia this summer, with irregularly hot and dry weather on the horizon.

El Nino is a climatic event occurring roughly every five years, which is defined by substantial warming in temperatures of the Pacific Ocean sea surface.

This week, the Bureau has raised its prediction of an El Nino hitting this Australian summer to 70 per cent, up from 50 per cent just two weeks ago.
