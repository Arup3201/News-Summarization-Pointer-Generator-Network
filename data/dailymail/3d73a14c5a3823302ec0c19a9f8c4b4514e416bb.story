The axe has been reinvented for the first time in 8,000 years with a new curved blade which is designed to stop momentum immediately on impact.

Retired air traffic controller Heikki Karna from Finland designed the bizarre looking Leveraxe which can cut an individual piece of fire wood with just one swipe.

But users don’t have to worry about using the axe with too much force like with conventional axes, which don’t stop on impact and can cause injuries.

This is because the curved design of the Leveraxe stops the axe’s momentum when it strikes the wood, reducing the risk of injury.

Mr Karna came up with the idea of the Leveraxe, the first redesigned axe since the Stone Age, when he began clearing trees to build a new home in the forest. 

During the arduous task his axe swung dangerously close to his legs on several occasions.

Thinking of ways to make his work safer and easier, he began to develop numerous prototypes which resulted in the creation of the Leveraxe.

The red coloured axe head is made from steel and weighs a little over four pounds

The axe's centre of gravity, which isn't directly above the blade but to the side, means it automatically comes down at an angle

Mr Karna, who lives in a remote forest near Helsinki, said: ‘Everybody who has tried splitting wood with a traditional axe knows that it takes a lot of power to penetrate and split the wood.

‘The Leveraxe allows you to easily and safely start splitting suitably sized logs from the sides by striking closer to edges.

A prehistoric stone axe, which hasn't changed much in 8,000 years until the invention of the Leveraxe

‘Now, there is no need to split the log in two first - you can just chop away.’

The red coloured axe head is made from steel and weighs a little over four pounds.

Its centre of gravity, which isn't directly above the blade but to the side, means the axe automatically comes down at an angle to split the wood.

People wielding the axe are advised to hold the 3ft long handle loosely when bringing it down for the best results and to also avoid sore hands.

It costs £158 and has been patented around the world.

Mr Karna added: ‘The international interest has been so big that I have run out of stock.

‘There will be some delay until I have new axes available as the production is nearly all hand made.

‘I have ordered new stuff, but I cannot get it immediately and there is a three month waiting list at the moment for new customers.’
