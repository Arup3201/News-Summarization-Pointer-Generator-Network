Flour power: Funeral director Julian Riley threw a bag of flour over his neighbour's Mercedes in a row over parking, but it set like concrete

An undertaker threw a bag of flour over his neighbour’s Mercedes in a parking row outside his funeral parlour, only for it to set as hard as concrete and cause £7,000 of damage.

A court heard that funeral director Julian Riley, 39, emptied the 2lb bag of self-raising flour over Peter Elliot's black E-320 because it was blocking access for his hearse.

He admitted throwing the flour, not expecting it to have caused any damage, but when Mr Elliot, 60, took the car to a specialist garage they found it had dried on the paintwork like 'brittle cement' and told him it would cost £7,397 to repair.

'It was crystalised powder, like brittle concrete, it had gone hard,' mechanic Lee Kedward, who examined the damaged car, told Newport Magistrates' Court.

'The main impact area was the bonnet and windscreen but the residue had gone all the way over the vehicle.

'There
 was little bits of the powder crystalised all over it, there was damage
 to the boot and a lot of powder around the heating ducts and filtration
 system.

'We tried to use hot soapy water but there were large pieces where you had to use your nail to scrape it off.

'You couldn’t get it all off without scratching the paint.'

Riley fell out with Mr Elliot after he bought a house opposite him in the village of Clydach, near Abergavenny, South Wales.

Newport magistrates heard the pair had argued over parking for weeks before the flour attack in September last year.

'Mr Elliot found his black Mercedes had been covered in white powder,' said prosecutor Andrew Kendall.

'A trail of white powder led from the vehicle across the road to the defendant’s property.'

Riley was arrested and admitted damaging the Mercedes-Benz E-320.

He told officers: 'Unfortunately I was very annoyed and took the law into my hands and threw a packet of self-raising flour over his car.

Rock solid: A mechanic told the court that the flour had turned into 'brittle concrete', and could not be removed without scratching the paintwork costing £7,000 to fix

'It was more or less the whole packet.'

Riley pleaded guilty to criminal damage but contested the cost of the damage to the Mercedes.

He went to a second specialist who estimated the damage to the car was around £400.

District Judge Richard Williams said described it as a 'spiteful and vengeful offence', but adjourned sentence until next month.

After the hearing Mr Elliot said: 'It’s unbelievable, I’ve never known anyone act like he has.

'There’s only one loser here and that’s me. I can’t understand why I should have to pay for this damage.'
