More than $72,000 dollars has been raised in 48 hours for the three children of a mother who was killed with an axe in an alleged domestic violence incident over the weekend.

Tara Costigan, whose body was found on the laundry floor of a Calwell home in Canberra on Saturday, leaves behind two sons aged 11 and nine, and a newborn girl only one week old.

Nearly $75,00 had been raised for the 28-year-old's children by Wednesday afternoon, only two days after the Go Fund Me page was created by her high school friend Emma Luke.

Over $70,000 had been raised for the 28-year-old's children by Wednesday afternoon, only two days after the Go Fund Me page was created by her high school friend Emma Luke 

'Everybody's touched by it. She has so many friends and other people who just want to help her kids at this time. Her family is massive as well, so lots of support for them,' Ms Luke told Fairfax.

Ms Costigan's cousin, Nathan Costigan, confirmed that 'all of the money raised would be forwarded to the three children whose safety and wellbeing he said were the family's first priority right now'. 

'A HUGE thank you to Emma Luke who started the gofundme page for the children. I can confirm it is legit, and I am meeting my local member Nicole Lawder MLA to source legal advice and a solicitor for the kids to ensure they receive every cent,' Mr Costigan said on Tuesday.

While more than 1,400 people have submitted donations on the page, hundreds more have offered clothing and toys after being touched by the tragedy.

'I am donating today because if my wife and I were to pass I would want to know that my little ones were looked after too. No one should have to grow up without their parents but should that happen its nice to know that society has your back,' one donor wrote.

On Monday, Ms Costigan's former partner Marcus Rappel, 40, (pictured) fronted the ACT Magistrates Court where he was charged with her murder

'I'm not in a position where I can donate money but I do have size 000 and 00 baby girls clothing I would happily donate if you are in need of them. Please contact me and I'll post to you. Thoughts are with all Tara's family and friends,' another wrote. 

A fundraising walk has also been organised by the Canberra Mums Exercise Group, which Ms Costigan was a member of, for March 22.

'Tara Costigan, was murdered over the weekend. To honour her life, raise funds for her three children that are now tragically without their mother, and to stand up against domestic violence, we would like as many of you as possible to participate in the fundraising walk,' the event's organisers said.

More than 1700 people are expected to attend the walk.

It comes amidst revelations that Ms Costigan (right) had been granted an interim domestic violence order against Rappel (left) just one day before he allegedly killed her

On Monday, Ms Costigan's former partner Marcus Rappel, 40, fronted the ACT Magistrates Court where he was charged with her murder, assaulting her sister and another man as well as breaching a protection order.

The courtroom was filled with dozens of Ms Costigan's supporters who yelled out at and tried to attack Rappel when he appeared, The Canberra Times reports.

One person was heard calling the accused a 'f***ing animal' while another screamed 'don't you look at us you piece of s***'.

It comes amidst revelations that Ms Costigan had been granted an interim domestic violence order against Rappel just one day before he allegedly killed her. 

'I think one positive point (if thats possible) is that this tragedy has again raised the issue of domestic violence and that it is very real in our community,' Mr Costigan said.
