An international consortium of more than 8,000 scientists have called for urgent help to save Earth's 100 most threatened animals, plants and fungi.

While Nature has always operated by survival of the fittest, humanity's increasing need for space is adding to the stresses on the natural kingdom.

The report blamed a loss of habitat, caused by a rising human population and other factors 
such as expanding cities, deforestation, pollution and climate change, 
for driving more and more species of animals and plants to extinction.

The 100 species, from 48 different countries are first in line to disappear completely if nothing is done to protect them.

Clinging to the edge: Cavia intermedia (left), otherwise known as Santa Catarina's guinea pig, is only found on the small island of Moleques do Sul - which is only 26acres in size. Meanwhile, there are just 170 of these albatrosses - Diomedea amsterdamensis - on 
their breeding spot of Amsterdam Island in the southern Indian Ocean

Ardeotis nigriceps: Hunted for food or sport, there are less than 250 left in Africa - and these are isolated in small groups across a wide area

They range from the Jamaican rock iguana - originally reported extinct, but now found to be clinging on with two small populations, to the suicide palm of Madagascar, which dies exhausted after producing tiny yellow flowers on a stem up to 5 metres (16 ft) long.

Many on the list, such as the Ethiopia's liben lark, or the Seychelles 
sheath-tailed bat, may not be as familiar to us as lions or whales, but each adds something to the planet which, once lost, is gone forever.

The report, 'Priceless or Worthless?', says all the species need to be much better protected or face extinction by 2020.

In the UK, a small area in Wales is the only place in the world where 
the brightly coloured willow blister (Cryptomyces maximus) is found.

Populations of the spore-shooting fungi are currently in decline, and a 
single catastrophic event could cause their total destruction.

Cryptomyces maximus occurs only on willows, as a weak parasite of twigs.

In
this highly specialised habitat, Cryptomyces maximus does not seriously
threaten the tree.

It produces extensive irregular black crusts below 
the bark, characteristically surrounded by a bright orange or yellow 
halo.

When ripe and moist, the fruit body expands, breaking through the bark, and splitting the crust to reveal the fertile layer.

Ascospores (sexually produced microscopic fungal spores) are released violently from this surface and are dispersed by the wind.

Only four sites, on the North West coast of Wales, are known.

The 124-page report will be presented at the 
IUCN World Conservation Congress in South Korea this week, and hopes to 
push the conservation of 'worthless' creatures up the agenda that is set
by NGOs from around the globe.

Professor Jonathan Baillie, director of conservation at ZSL, said: 'Over half (of the 100 most endangered species) are receiving little or no attention.

'The donor community and conservation movement are leaning increasingly 
towards a 'what can nature do for us' approach, where species and wild 
habitats are valued and prioritised according to the services they 
provide for people.

'This has made it increasingly difficult for 
conservationists to protect the most threatened species on the planet.

'While the utilitarian value of nature is important conservation goes 
beyond this. Do these species have a right to survive or do we have a 
right to drive them to extinction?'

Co-author of the report, ZSL's Ellen Butcher says: 'All the species 
listed are unique and irreplaceable.

'If they vanish, no amount of money 
can bring them back. However, if we take immediate action we can give 
them a fighting chance for survival.

'But this requires society to 
support the moral and ethical position that all species have an inherent
right to exist.'

The IUCN said the report 'hopes to push the conservation of 'worthless' 
creatures up the agenda that is set by NGOs (non-governmental 
organisations) from around the globe.'

'We need a fund to prevent extinction, resourced by governments, that is
in the billions, not millions,' the report said, without specifying a 
currency.

Measures such as an expansion of protected areas or hunting bans were particularly needed, it said.

Antilophia bokermanni: In 2000, there were believed to be just 50 of these birds left in the wilds of Brazil. This increased to 250 - until a theme park was built in the region, decimating the population again

Psammobates geometricus has lost 97 per cent of its habitat, thanks to building work in South-Western Cape of South Africa

Baillie said people may have gone too far in recent years in judging 
animals and plants by the economic value of the services they provide, 
including food, medicine or as tourist attractions.

'We need to keep the appreciation for the wonderful diversity of life on
Earth as the key message, and then other utilitarian arguments have to 
be additional,' he said.

Governments agreed in 2010 to a plan to protect life on earth that 
included the goal: 'By 2020 the extinction of known threatened species 
has been prevented and their conservation status, particularly of those 
most in decline, has been improved and sustained.'

The IUCN said that all species had value.

'Although the value of some species may not appear obvious at first, all
species in fact contribute in their way to the healthy functioning of 
the planet,' said Simon Stuart, Chair of the IUCN Species Survival 
Commission.

The list of the 100 most endangered species included others such as the Cayman Islands ghost orchid, and the Javan rhino.

A ban on hunting had helped the recovery of the humpback whale, now 
estimated to number 60,000.

Captive breeding meant that Przewalski's 
horse, once almost extinct, now numbered more than 300 in the wild from 
Ukraine to China.

The pygmy three-toed sloth (Bradypus pygmaeus) is one of the animals 
facing a bleak future. Escudo Island, 17km off the coast of Panama, is 
the only place in the world where these tiny sloths are found.

At half 
the size of their mainland cousins, and weighing roughly the same as a 
newborn baby, pygmy sloths are the smallest and slowest sloths in the 
world and remain Critically Endangered.

Similarly, the saola (Pseudoryx nghetinhensis) is one of the most 
threatened mammals in Southeast Asia. Known as the Asian unicorn because
of its rarity, the population of these antelope may be down to few tens
of individuals today.

In the UK, a small area in Wales is the only place in the world where 
the brightly coloured willow blister (Cryptomyces maximus) is found. 
Populations of the spore-shooting fungi are currently in decline, and a 
single catastrophic event could cause their total destruction.

Professor Baillie said: 'If we believe these species are priceless it is
time for the conservation community, government and industry to step up
to the plate and show future generations that we value all life.''

Whilst monetising nature remains a worthwhile necessity for 
conservationists, the wider value of species on the brink of extinction 
should not be disregarded, the report states.
