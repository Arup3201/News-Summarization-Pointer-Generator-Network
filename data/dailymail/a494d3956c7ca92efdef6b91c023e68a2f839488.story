The mother of a 16-year-old Arizona schoolgirl shot dead by a 15-year-old school friend on Friday has hit out at her daughter's school, saying it should have kept her safe.

Anastasia Greer was shot dead by Matthew Bolton in the street outside her friend's home last Thursday.

But contrary to previous reports the two had not recently ended a relationship, and Anasatasia was trying to protect Bolton's unnamed ex-girlfriend, with whom she was friends, when she was shot.

Anastasia's mother Diannah Dinsmore spoke out as it emerged Bolton had made a series of threats against his ex-girlfriend, and Anastasia had gone the unnamed girl's house to protect her. When Bolton arrived at the home, Anastasia went out to confront him and was shot dead before he killed himself.

Police say Anastasia had reported Bolton to school administrators on Thursday, saying he had threatened to beat up his former girlfriend.

Officials at Sandra Day O'Connor High School contacted the parents of the girl Bolton is said to have threatened but because he was off school on Thursday and Friday, they were unable to speak to him.

The following day, Anastasia and the girl, who used to date Bolton, returned to school and after class Anastasia met Bolton to confront him about the threats.

The school said Anastasia had not been a target of Bolton's threats, and the school's police officer had tried to get in touch with the student on Friday.

Police have said in the hours leading up to the shooting, one of Anastasia's friends had been so concerned for her safety that he gave her a small knife, and had asked Bolton if he was armed.

Bolton had said he didn't have a gun, but
 a few moments later the same friend saw him chasing Anastasia, before 
hearing gunshots and later seeing Bolton take his own life.

'We don't know what transpired when the 
two went outside as far as any type of discussion, other than to say a 
witness saw Matthew chasing Ana and heard gunshots,' Sergeant Tommy Thompson said.

'About that time the 
friend that lived in the residence came outside to discover Ana had been
 shot, he then witnessed Matthew shoot himself.'

Anastasia's mother however, has hit out at the school for not doing more to respond to reports of Bolton making threats. 

'I
 trusted the school to do what they were supposed to do, that's what 
they were entrusted for. I put my daughter in their care for her to be 
safe,' she told My Fox Phoenix.

Mrs
 Dinsmoore also denied claims that her daughter had been romantically 
involved with Bolton, saying the pair hadn't spoken for months.

She admitted Bolton had bought her daughter a teddy bear last month, but said her daughter had not been allowed to date.

Police say the gun used to kill Anastasia was taken from Bolton's brother, who kept it locked in his bedroom.

Bolton is believed to have broken a window to get inside the room and get the gun.

Mrs Dinsmoore told AZ Central she found out her daughter had been killed after asking the girl's friends where she was.

After hearing about the shooting, Mrs Dinsmoore went to the house where Anastasia had been shot to look for her daughter.

'I was like, "Iâ€™m looking for my daughter. Whereâ€™s Ana?" All their faces drop, and [they] point around the corner, and then I saw an officer ... I already knew what they were going to tell me,' she said.

Officers responded to a 911 call of a 
shooting around noon and found the two teenagers dead in the home's 
front yard from gunshot wounds.

A neighbor, Jim Friel, told The Arizona Republic that he heard a scream and then gunshots and went across the street to the home to see what happened.

He found the girl lying on the ground with gunshot wounds to her chest and the boy with a gunshot wound to his face.

Grieving friends described Anastasia as a kind and outgoing girl who was active in her school's ROTC program. 

Classmate Caleb Fleck told the station KPHO that Bolton, who was in his ROTC class, was well-behaved and was never known to be a troublemaker.

On his Facebook page, Matthew posted on Valentine's Day a photo of him and Anastasia smiling and holding a red 'I love you' teddy bear with a heart-shaped nose.
