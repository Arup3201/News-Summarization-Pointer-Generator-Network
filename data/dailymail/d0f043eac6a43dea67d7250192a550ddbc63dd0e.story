California is experiencing its worst drought since 1895 with no signs of it abating due to a stubborn ridge of high pressure that is lurking offshore and blocking typical winter weather.Â 

Nearly four miles high and 2,000 miles long, it is to blame for the emerging drought as the mass of high air pressure has been blocking Pacific winter storms from coming ashore and bringing much needed to bring rain to the parched West Coast.

The duration of the upper-level ridge of high pressure anchored off its north coast - since December 2012 - is unprecedented in modern weather records and puzzling researchers.

Risk: One town on the northern coast has claimed it has fewer than 100 days of drinking water in storage. Above, a warning sign on a dried-out beach at Folsom Lake

Cause: The dry conditions are believed to have been caused by a 2,000-mile ridge of high pressure that is lurking offshore and blocking typical winter weather

'It's like the Sierra - a mountain 
range just sitting off the West Coast -- only bigger,' said Bob 
Benjamin, a forecaster with the National Weather Service in Monterey, 
Calif told Sci-Today Tech.

'This ridge is sort of a mountain in the atmosphere. In most years, it comes and goes. This year it came and didn't go.'

The
 current high-pressure ridge is even stronger and more persistent than a
 similar ridge that parked over the Pacific Ocean during the 1976-77 
drought, one of the worst in the 20th century.

This ridge has persisted for 13 
months and the longer it lingers, the less likely it is to leave, 
climatologist Brian Fuchs, from the National Drought Mitigation Center 
in Lincoln, Nebraska told Yahoo.

This
 high pressure ridge system is feeding on itself, 'creating a sort of 
perfect environment for perpetuating the dry conditions' it creates, he 
explained.

Concern: Precipitation in most of the state less than 20 per cent of normal - leaving reservoir levels at record lows and prompting many cities to cut water usage

California is under the influence of a persistent upper-level ridge of high pressure anchored off its north coast that has kept the region generally warm, dry and clear.

Nearly four miles high and 2,000 miles long, is to blame for the emerging drought as the mass of high air pressure has been blocking Pacific winter storms from coming ashore and bringing much needed to bring rain to the parched West Coast.

The mass of high air pressure has been blocking Pacific winter storms from coming ashore in California, pushing them into Alaska and British Columbia - it is even responsible for rain and cold weather to the East Coast.

Similar high-pressure zones pop up all the time during most winters, but they usually break down, allowing rain to get through to California.

The duration of its presence - 13 months - is unprecedented in modern weather records and puzzling researchers - it has been named the 'ridiculously resilient ridge.'

Yesterday House Speaker John Boehner 
visited a dusty California field joining Central Valley Republicans to 
announce an emergency drought-relief bill to help farmers through what 
is certain to be a devastating year.

If
 passed, the bill that's already stirring controversy would temporarily 
halt restoration of the San Joaquin River designed to bring back the 
historic salmon flow, among other measures. Farmers want that water 
diverted to their crops.

Standing
 on the field just outside of Bakersfield, Boehner said that where he's 
from in Ohio, the logic applied in California regarding water policy 
would cause people to shake their heads.

'How you can favor fish over people is something people in my part of the world would never understand,' Boehner said. Without the emergency legislation, thousands of farmworkers will be unemployed, he said.

The bill is expected to be introduced in two weeks. It calls for allowing farmers to pump from the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta as water permits and forms a House-Senate committee to tackle water troubles.

Boehner was joined by three Republican colleagues: Rep. Devin Nunes of Tulare, Rep. Kevin McCarthy of Bakersfield and Rep. David Valadao of Hanford.

The announcement followed Gov. Jerry Brown's declaration on Friday that California is suffering from a drought.

Valadao said Boehner's visit draws the nation's attention to California's dry weather. In turn, each lawmaker railed on Senate Democrats for failing to negotiate with them.

Assistance: The U.S. Department of Agriculture declared a drought disaster on January 16, which allows some farmers to apply for low-interest loans to help them cope

Left out: American ranchers are not included in the programme, and therefore, do not qualify for any help with the rising cost of feeding their cattle

In a statement, Democratic Sen. Diane Feinstein rejected the claim of inaction.

Restoration of the San Joaquin River has caused fierce battles spanning years that have pitted farmers in need of irrigation water against groups that wish to bring the salmon runs back to historic levels.

'Salmon, and families (who) depend on them, are the ones we need to act to save now,' John McManus, executive director of Golden Gate Salmon Association, said in a statement. 'Salmon are dying in the drought-stricken Central Valley rivers and soon that will translate into lost jobs on the coast and inland waterways.'

The San Joaquin River starts in the Sierra Nevada east of Fresno and collects at the Friant Dam into Millerton Lake.

It flows a few miles after the dam but dries up before reaching the Pacific Ocean.

The river resumes downstream with water from the Merced, Tuolumne and Stanislaus rivers, which each have salmon population.

The river's restoration is estimated to cost $1 billion in federal funds.

Among the difficulties, some former river bottom has subsided from pumping, and engineers will need to find ways to send the water uphill along its previous route. Farmland may end up flooding.

Farmer Larry Starrh, who opened up his field to the congressional delegation, said the drought has caused his family to make the difficult decision to lay fallow 1,000 acres covered with producing almond trees and leave another 2,000 across of land unused.

'Water is a weapon,' Starrh said as his voice shook with emotion. 'Water is a hostage. Our water system is battered and broken. It's been hijacked by unreasonableness, and we need help.'
