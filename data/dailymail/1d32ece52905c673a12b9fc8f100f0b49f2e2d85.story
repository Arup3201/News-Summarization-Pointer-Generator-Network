An NHS dentist who was so hardworking he never refused a patient was driven to suicide when health chiefs threatened to strike him off over his record-keeping.

Dr Anand Kamath, 42, was the only NHS dentist in his area and took on as many people as he could so they would not have to pay to go private.

But the father-of-three became the  subject of an investigation when NHS  officials criticised his record-keeping,  which had suffered due to his 10,000-strong list of patients.

Dr Anand Kamath (right) had 10,000 patients on his books but was threatened with being struck off because of minor record keeping errors. His wife Dr Rajni Prasad (left) accused health chiefs of driving her husband to suicide

His widow told an inquest he felt 
‘bullied and harassed’ after being summoned for a meeting and sent a 
letter warning he could be reported to the General Dental Council.  Now 
the British Dental Association has called on the NHS to hold an inquiry 
into his death.

His wife Dr Rajni Prasad, a dentist 
who worked alongside him, wept yesterday as she said over-zealous health
officials had driven him to his death.

‘It was just too much. They behaved like bullies and drove a loyal NHS servant over the edge,’ she said.

‘He just couldn’t take the anxiety. He
wasn’t eating or sleeping after the meeting. When the letter came that 
was the final straw. He gave everything to the NHS. He worried about 
losing everything if they stopped us practising.’

She added: ‘His reward for caring for 
thousands of patients no other practice would take was to be threatened 
with the most severe disciplinary action over administrative matters 
which we agreed straightaway needed improvement.’

The inquest in Wakefield, Yorkshire, 
heard last week how Dr Kamath and his wife, 42, had worked for the NHS 
in Leeds for ten years.

The pair tried to take on as many 
patients as possible, giving them a list four times the length of the 
average practice. For the first four years at Rothwell Dental Surgery Dr
Kamath did not take a holiday and rarely took a lunchbreak. At one 
point, the centre was treating up to 50 people a day.

Dr Prasad said her husband was a servant to NHS

The couple were on a modest  contract and could have earned tens of thousands more treating private patients.

But after two minor complaints, the 
primary care trust conducted an audit which led to an investigation into
record-keeping. The pair were called to a meeting in December where 
trust officials threatened to report them to the General Dental Council.

Two days later a letter arrived from the same managers warning of action to suspend them from the list of NHS-approved dentists.

Soon afterwards, Dr Kamath’s wife found him dead at their home in Pudsey near Leeds.

She told the inquest: ‘We were both 
very stressed and felt vulnerable, harassed and bullied with no support 
offered.’ Wakefield coroner David Hinchliff recorded a verdict of 
suicide and said unreasonable pressure exerted on Dr Kamath by the trust
‘pushed a good man over the edge’.

Dr Prasad said: ‘I told my children dad died after a fall. How could I tell them the awful truth?’

An NHS England spokesman said: ‘We are
happy that the investigation that was being undertaken at this practice
was following National Clinical Assessment service advice.’AN NHS
