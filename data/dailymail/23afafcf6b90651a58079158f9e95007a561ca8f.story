There appear to be noises that another Belgian is set to arrive in the Premier League? Are we starting a colony?

Calm down. But yes, a trio of English clubs led by Liverpool are monitoring Zakaria Bakkali, PSV Eindhoven’s 18-year-old forward as he develops his game in the Eredivisie. Tottenham and Arsenal are also said to admire him.

Hot Spur: Mauricio Pochettino

So is any bid likely this summer?

The suggestion is that offers could wait until next year but interest from Valencia could prompt action.

Why is he on the radar of these clubs?

Having impressed at various age levels he burst to prominence with a hat-trick against NEC in August last season aged just 17 years and 196 days. It made him the youngest player to score three goals in a game in the history of the Dutch top-flight.

His strikes were all high quality too; his first a left-foot shot arrowed in off the bar, his second a well-placed effort from distance, his third a precise curler from his right boot after a smart dribble.

Some statement. Did it prompt international recognition?

Yes, Marc Wilmots called him up for Belgium and he made his debut in the World Cup qualifier against Wales last October, coming on as a 78th minute substitute for Everton’s Kevin Mirallas.

The appearance ended speculation about which country he would represent given his parents are Moroccan. But like Marouane Fellaini, Bakkali chose the country of his birth.

That begs the question – where was he born and how did he come to Holland so young?

Bakkali was born in Liege, and represented Standard Liege until moving to PSV at the tender age of 12 to join their academy.

So what is his style and what are his stats?

Standing at under 5ft 5in tall, Bakkali has been compared to Sergio Aguero for bustling running and sharp shooting. He is extremely quick and possesses rapid acceleration as well as close ball control skills. He likes to run at players, cut in from the wings, and strike with either foot.

He impressed on his debut for PSV, a Champions League qualifier against Belgian club Zulte-Waregem, and scored in the second leg.

He has been used intermittently since his breakthrough as he progresses, with three goals in 16 Eredivisie appearances. Across various youth levels for Belgium his return is 18 goals in 26 games.
