School got off to an early start in Lakewood, Colorado this morning as Katy Perry performed a birthday concert at Lakewood High School.

Appearing in a cheerleader uniform, ponytail and sneakers – and with the band wearing school football jerseys, the singer took to a specially constructed stage in the school’s gym.

The lucky Lakewood students won the Perry concert by making a lip-dub video of the singer's hit song 'Roar,' which they entered into a national contest on 'Good Morning America.'

Perry picked Lakewood High School as the winner. Lakewood High School's mascot is the tigers, so the idea of making a video to the name ‘Roar’ seemed appropriate.

‘For me, Lakewood really embodied a whole school spirit,’ Perry said when she picked the contest winner last week.

‘I think they brought everyone together and you saw so many different people coming together to do one shot.’

More than 2,000 students from 80 different school clubs were involved in Lakewood High School's entry.

‘It was so incredibly crafted,’ Perry said. ‘The clubs, the cliques, they all came together and did their own individual thing, but it was so interesting and well done and well organized.’

Perry was impressed that so many kids at Lakewood High came together ‘to roar.’

‘That is what this competition embodies,’ Perry said.

Students at Lakewood told 7NEWS that they practiced several times before the big day because it had to be done in a single take.

The school rehearsed for two weeks with 98 percent of the student body taking part in the final video.

After seeing the video last month, Perry Tweeted, ‘Oh my GAWD. Now this is what I call school. I hear you roaring LAKEWOOD HIGH!’

Crews spent several days transforming the school's gym into a TV studio and concert hall.

‘Were starting to build, to build the stage and the lighting is starting to come.  Not only are we putting on a great music performance, we are also putting on a TV show, so it's having those two things come together,’ said Kyle Morris, production manager for Good Morning America.

The concert was for Lakewood High School students only.

Senior Jessica Kostelnik coined the motto "One World, One Roar," which challenges every high school in the country to raise $1,000 to donate to a charity of their choice.

Students were instructed to arrive at the school no later than 4:15 a.m.

The crowd sang "Happy Birthday" to the pop star in honor of her 29th birthday,

Principal Ron Castagna couldn't be more proud of his students.

 ‘Students have made this about not just winning a concert, but sending a message, and trying to unite all students throughout the country, to show there is a common good,’ Castagna said.

Once it was over, Perry tweeted "Thanks for a GREAT morning LAKEWOOD HIGH! Keep #ROARING
