It’s long been known that carbon dioxide is absorbed by the land and oceans.

However, the rate at which the gas is absorbed is thought to be much lower than what humans pump into the atmosphere.

Now a 10-year study suggests the figure may be slightly higher than previously thought – but it is still not enough to save us from disaster, experts claim.

Deserts could absorb CO2 at a faster rate in the future but it will not be enough to save us from climate change, according to a new study

The findings are the result of an experiment performed in the Mojave Desert in southern Nevada.

In the study, nine separate desert plots were exposed to different levels of carbon dioxide over a decade.

Three received no extra air, three were pumped with the modern level of carbon dioxide - 380 parts per million - and three received concentrations of the level expected in 2050, 550 parts per million.

Perhaps somewhat expectedly, the plots that were exposed to more carbon dioxide accumulated it at a faster rate than the plots that were not.

While the findings indicate that arid ecosystems can serve as sinks for carbon dioxide, the ramifications of the findings do not alter the need to tackle climate change.

‘It is definitely not going to stop it,’ lead author of the study Dave Evans from Washington State University told NBC News.

‘Just now we are understanding the processes that are going on.

‘But we are still seeing huge amounts of carbon accumulating in the atmosphere.’

A recent report by the IPCC suggests the future effects of climate change could be catastrophic

Analysis of the data suggests that deserts could account for 15 to 28 per cent of carbon absorbed by land surfaces.

But this would still be only four to eight per cent of total carbon dioxide emissions in the future.

Christopher Field, lead author of a new Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change (IPCC), said it was not entirely clear how to interpret the results.

‘It is worth noting that, although the sink in this experiment is significant, it is about a hundredfold less than typical sinks in young forested ecoysystems,’ he says.

‘The bottom line is that deserts will not save us from climate change.’

Food shortages are expected to get worse

The report claims that increases in crop yields have slowed over the last 40 years.

Some studies now point to dramatic declines in some crops over the next 50 years – especially wheat and corn.

Violent conflict may be triggered as a result

Climate
 change will complicate and worsen existing global security problems, 
such as civil wars, strife between nations and refugees.

Fights over resources, like water and energy, hunger and extreme weather will all go into the mix to destabilise the world.

The gap between the rich and the poor could widen

Poor people are going to bear an unfair burden of climate change, the report said.

Climate
 change is going to exacerbate existing inequalities, and it is going to
 make it harder for people to fight their way out of poverty.

Everyone will be affected

This, the report claims, is because there are limits to how far society can adapt to climate change.

The
 only way to cut emissions is to act now and at the same time make plans
 to keep people out of harms' way when extreme weather strikes.

Mitigating climate change is tough but achievable

The report notes that research on the effects of climate change has doubled since the last report in 2007.

The understanding about what needs to done to protect people from severe consequences has also improved dramatically.
