A computer programme has been used to predict how people are feeling when they type.

In a study participants were asked to type a particular phrase and the programme then estimated if they were happy, sad and so on.

Remarkably it was correct 70 per cent of the time, and the findings could lead to smarter artificial intelligence in the future.

Islamic University of Technology in Bangladesh researchers studied typing. They found that the way a person types can reveal how they are feeling (stock image shown). In the study 25 people were asked to write a section of a book. A computer programme then predicted with 70 per cent accuracy how they were feeling

The study published in the journal Behaviour and Information Technology was carried out by researchers at the Islamic University of Technology in Bangladesh, reports Live Science.

In the research 25 people ranging from 15 to 40 years old were asked to retype two paragraphs from Alice's Adventures in Wonderland by Lewis Carroll.

They also had to enter their emotional state every 30 minutes while doing their regular activities on the computer.

Researchers have revealed exactly what mobile phone users type most - and say that 'I love you' is the most popular three word sentence.

The team at SwiftKey analysed web data along with anonymous data from their hugely popular alternative keyboard, which has been downloaded to more than 100 million devices, and also found phone users are extremely polite.

The single most commonly used one word sentence in English is 'thanks' and the most popular two word phrase is 'thank you'. 

This allowed the programme an opportunity to understand how their emotions changed their typing style.

Moods tested were joy, fear, anger, sadness, disgust, shame and guilt.

The result was that the programme could identify a person's mood correctly 70 per cent of the time.

It was most successful in identifying joyfulness with an 87 per cent success rating, while sadness was the least accurate at 60 per cent.

The researchers noted that the participants were less likely to input data when they were in a bad mood, which may explain the inaccuracy of the latter result.

Joy was predicted successfully most often and least successful was sadness. The researchers say this could lead to smarter artificial intelligence in future that can make suggestions to us based on how we are typing at that moment in time (stock image shown)

However the findings could have important implications for artificial intelligence, and it may allow computers to engage with us in a more friendly manner.

'If we could build any system that is intelligent enough to interact with humans that involves emotions - that is, it can detect user emotions and change its behavior accordingly - then using machines could be more effective and friendly,' the researchers wrote.

For example, this could enable pop-up ads to be tailored to how you are feeling at the moment.

Or, when looking for a movie on Netflix, perhaps an algorithm could make suggestions for films that would match your mood.
