A babysitter facing charges of sexual assault on a child is now accused of having sex with a second 14-year-old boy.

Loni Bouchard, 20, of Clinton, Connecticut, was arrested yesterday accused of having an inappropriate relationship with a teenager in November last year.

Bouchard was also arrested three months ago for having sex with another 14-year-old who she babysat early in 2011 and plied with alcohol and marijuana allegedly supplied by her mother.

Southington police confirmed that they 
arrested Bouchard on the fresh sexual assault charges and that she is 
being held on $25,000 bail.

Bouchard’s lawyer said today she is in counselling and hopes people will not pre-judge her.

In July, Bouchard was arrested following a three-month investigation into her relationship with a boy she babysat regularly.

According to police records, Bouchard repeatedly stayed over at the home of the boy, and offered him alcohol and marijuana in addition to having sex with him.

When the boy’s mother discovered their relationship through Facebook messages, she notified police.

Court records reveal details of 
evidence seized that included a notebook with a photo of Justin Bieber 
on the cover that Bouchard had used as a journal detailing her 
relationship with the most recent 14-year-old.

In the handwritten notes Bouchard writes about the 'amazing' sex 
she had with the boy and professed her love for him.

'I know there is a five-year age difference, but why does it have to matter?' she wrote in the journal. 'I don’t care about the law.  I just want to be with him and not have to hide it.

'How can the law tell us who to fall for, who to like and who to
love and especially who to date? I thought America was a free country.

Bouchard’s mother, Kimmy Bouchard, is also charged in providing alcohol and marijuana following the affair.

It has also been revealed that the boy's parents filed a restraining order against Miss Bouchard in May.

Around that time, she wrote in her journal: ‘His mom absolutely HATES me because of the situation and I understand why, but she's being immature about it.’

She also wrote that she was cutting herself and used a bracelet the boy gave her to cover the scratches.

In a separate notebook seized from her home, police found letters written to the boy, where Miss Bouchard said she was upset his parents had filed the restraining order, and missed waking up next to him.

Bouchard, who had been freed from jail after posting $1,000 bond, faces charges of second-degree sexual assault, purchasing alcohol for a minor and two counts of risk of injury to a minor.
