Man of the moment Matthew McConaughey has taken up an unlikely cause - supporting Washington Redskins team owner Dan Snyder in his quest to keep the team's name which many Native American groups consider offensive.

Despite being born and raised in Texas, the Academy Award-winning actor has been a Redskins fan since the age four, when he rooted for the Indians in Western movies and associated then-quarterback Chris Hanburger with his favorite food - hamburgers.  

'I love the emblem. I dig it. It gives me a little fire and some oomph,' McConaughey said in an interview with GQ.

Civil rights groups have been fighting for years to get the team's name changed, and that cause gained some traction recently when the U.S. Patent Office cancelled the Redskins  trademark  in June for being 'disparaging to Native Americans'.

However, team-owner Snyder has personally vowed never to change the name on the basis that it 'honors' the American Indian legacy, and is currently engaged in a legal battle to keep the moniker.

'I know a lot of Native Americans don't have a problem with it, but they're not going to say, "No, we really want the name." That's not how they're going to use their pulpit,' McConaughey said. 

Not offended: In an interview with GQ, the Academy Award-winning actor says he knows native Americans who do not have a problem with the name.

'It's like my feeling about gun control: "I get it. You have the right to have guns. But look, let's forget that right. Let's forget the pleasure you get safely on your range, because it's in the wrong hands in other places,"' he added. 

'What interests me is how quickly it got pushed into the social consciousness. We were all fine with it since the 1930s, and all of a sudden we go, "No, gotta change it"? It seems like when the first levee breaks, everybody gets on board.

However, McConaughey says he won't be hurt if Snyder is eventually forced to change the team name. 

'Now that it's in the court of public opinion, it's going to change. I wish it wouldn't, but it will,' the actor said.

This isn't the first time McConaughey has come out in support of the Redskins. 

Last June, the actor swung by practice while in the D.C. area for a charity event, where he was pictured chatting up quarterback Robert Griffin III  and watching drills from the sidelines with Snyder.

McConaughey is in the middle of a career-resurgence, and this year won the Academy Award for Best Actor for his role in Dallas Buyers Club, as well as Emmy nomination for acting on TV show True Detective.

He is will next star in space-drama Interstellar, which is slated to be released next month.
