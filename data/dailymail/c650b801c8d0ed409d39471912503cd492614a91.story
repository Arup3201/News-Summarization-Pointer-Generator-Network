It started as a ‘tussle,’ just a ‘skirmish,’ but at some point, Raul Barrera simply ‘lost it’.

‘You know, I just saw this blood, so much at the time,’ he added. The chilling confession of the man dubbed the Lower East Side girlfriend-butcher was played publicly for the first time at Barrera’s pre-sentencing hearing in Manhattan Supreme Court.

The 33-year-old fashion publicist admitted to stabbing his beautiful girlfriend Sarah Coit, 23, some 30 times in her Clinton Street apartment last year.

Such were the extent of the injuries, that Miss Coit was found disembowelled and her head had almost been removed from her body. The blade of one of the knives used was still embedded in her skull.

‘I don’t know. I lost it,’ Barrera is heard mumbling to a police officer and a prosecutor just five hours after the brutal slaying of the young Lacoste sales manager.

Barrera said the pair had begun arguing before the ‘tussle’ began and ‘things got out of control’.

He said: ‘Then we started arguing a little bit. Got into a tussle and there was this silver cart thing next to the edge of the kitchen counter and we must have knocked it down and we must have knocked it down and all the cutlery, the knives were in the…they just all fell to the ground and then we fell to the ground. 

‘And I was on top of her. Then my hand just got a cut and it was bleeding a lot profusely and I just…things got out of control.’

After stabbing Miss Coit repeatedly, he then admitted to dragging her, as she lay dying, from her living room into her bedroom before flinging his coat on her, according to the New York Post.

Rather than calling the emergency services, he phoned his parents, sister and his son to ‘apologise,’ changed out of his blood-soaked clothes and left the New York apartment to hail a cab.

All the while his girlfriend lay bleeding out in her bedroom.

When asked by the prosecutor whether he thought to call 911, Barrera simply answered: ‘No.’

At no point in the interview did Barrera ask what condition Coit was in, but he did note that her condition was ‘really bad’ at the point of leaving the flat.

He was then asked why he did not call an ambulance.

‘I was just afraid, panicked, scared,’ he explained of not calling an ambulance. ‘I just, I didn’t know what to expect.’

Last week Barrera pleaded guilty to Coit’s murder. Manhatten Supreme Court Justice Richard Carruthers presided over that plea as well as the two-day pre-sentencing hearing that concluded on Monday.

Barrera will find out the sentence for his crime on October 29, and is expected to receive anything from 15 years to life in prison. The killer is hoping his mental state and his guilty plea will earn him a lesser sentence.

Last week, Miss Coit’s father, Lynde Coit, laid bare  his grief at the loss of his daughter as he testified in court.

In an emotional testimony, the millionaire lawyer from Greenwich, said: ‘When I identified Sarah's body in the basement of the morgue, her injuries, the look on her face, the terror, will haunt me for the rest of my life and haunt the rest of her family.'

Mr Coit described how he had travelled to New York, expecting to share a meal with his daughter at her favourite pizza restaurant, according to The New York Post.

He read aloud his final text to his daughter - 'Love you,' which he sent as he set off for the city.But she had already been dead for eight hours and what he saw when he arrived in New York was Miss Coit's once-beautiful face criss-crossed by gashes in the city morgue, her perfect teeth grimacing in pain.

Prosecutor Matthew Bogdanos told Manhattan Supreme Court Justice Carruthers, who will decide Barrera's fate, that the killer murdered the young marketer with 'breathtaking viciousness.'

He also described how neighbours awoke to her screams but heart-wrenchingly couldn't work out where to send police, according to The New York Post.

Cold blooded: Barrera left the apartment, with Miss Coit bleeding on her bedroom floor, and hailed a cab to leave the scene

'There were so many soul-shattering screams that half-a-dozen New Yorkers got out of their beds at 2.30 in the morning,' Bogdanos said.

'These neighbors roamed their hallways, calling, "Where are you? Where are you?"

Miss Coit was living in a tenement apartment in the lower Manhattan neighbourhood and the proximity of the houses to each other left neighbours thinking her blood-curdling screams were coming from the building next door.

As such, Barrera was lacerating the young woman for 35 minutes before police finally knocked on the right apartment, eventually finding her breathing her last breathes in a puddle of blood, with bent and broken knives littering the floor.

Prosecutors are expected to ask for the maximum sentence - 25 years to life. But defence attorney Paul Feinman is likely to argue that Barrera deserves a reduced sentence because of mental health issues.
