Steve Smith scored his fourth century of the series against India to match a record held by Donald Bradman and Jacques Kallis.

Only Aussie legend Bradman and South Africa’s Kallis had scored tons in four consecutive Tests in the same series.

Australia captain Smith hit 117 in the fourth Test in Sydney to put his side well in control as they look to win the series 3-0. They declared on 572 for seven towards the end of day two, with India 71 for one at stumps.

New Zealand won their series 2-0 against Sri Lanka with a 193-run victory in Wellington. They overturned a first-innings deficit of 145 thanks to 242 from Kane Williamson and 142 from BJ Watling, who both ended unbeaten after a Test-record sixth-wicket stand of 365. After that, New Zealand skittled Sri Lanka for 196.

England Lions had to settle for a draw with a Gauteng Invitational XI, with captain Jonathan Trott hitting an unbeaten 79 in the second innings.

He declared with England 440 ahead but his bowlers couldn’t force the win, with Gauteng ending the match on 120 for eight.
