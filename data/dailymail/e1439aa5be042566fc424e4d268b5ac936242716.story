Nigel Havers has played his fair share of bounders in everything from Coronation Street to Downton Abbey. Now he’s uncovered a real-life cad in his own family.

The star has discovered that his great-great-grandfather David Couch, the son of a successful flour miller in 19th Century Cornwall, fathered a child by one of the family’s domestic servants.

Havers, 61, who shot to fame playing the reckless hero in  the 1987 hit ITV drama The Charmer, said the irony was not lost on him. 

He said of David: ‘He just couldn’t resist it. I’ve been playing these parts for years.’ 

The actor, whose big screen credits include Chariots Of Fire, made the discovery while researching his family tree for the BBC programme Who Do You Think You Are?

He is often portrayed as one of Britain’s ‘best known toffs’ and has a background to suit.

His father Michael, who served as Attorney General and Lord Chancellor under Mrs Thatcher, defended Mick Jagger and Keith Richards against drug charges in the 1960s.

He later went on to prosecute Peter Sutcliffe, the Yorkshire Ripper. 

Havers’ grandfather Sir Cecil Havers had an equally distinguished legal career and was the judge who presided over the trial of Ruth Ellis, the last woman hanged in Britain.

Havers said he was delighted to have uncovered a part of his family tree which wasn’t remotely posh.

He also traces the chequered history of his great-great-great-grandfather Henry Hamblion who hired out horses and coaches, became a publican, was involved in the railways...then went bankrupt.
