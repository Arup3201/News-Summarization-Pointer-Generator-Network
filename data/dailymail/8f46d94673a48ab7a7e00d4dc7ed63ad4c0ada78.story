Another British jihadi is believed to have died while fighting for ISIS, bringing the known total number of Brits killed in Iraq and Syria to 36.

The fighter, known among extremists as Abu Qudama Al-Britani, has been the subject of tributes among jihadists on social media in recent days.

Very few details are known about him aside from his name and that he was British, according to Shiraz Maher, a senior fellow at the International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation and Political Violence (ICSR).

Shiraz Maher from the ICSR tweeted this picture and confirmed the fighter's death, but was unable to clarify which of the two men pictured was the British national who died

While he confirmed the fighter had been killed, Mr Maher said he had no biographical data on Abu Qudama, including where in Britain he was originally from.

In a series of tweets, he also said it was unclear which of the two men featured in an photo circulating online was the deceased fighter.

A spokesman for the Foreign Office told MailOnline it could not confirm if the reports were correct.

Abu Qudama's death follows that of British man Abu Abdel Malik al-Britani, who was killed fighting for ISIS last month in the Syrian desert town of Dabiq.

November  remains the deadliest month on record for British nationals fighting for the terror group after the figure swelled as American-led airstrikes targeted the group's strongholds.

News of another British death in the region comes as a suicide blast and  clashes with ISIS extremists killed at least 23 troops and pro-government fighters in Iraq's embattled western province of Anbar, officials said.

The day's heavy toll for the Iraqi forces came as they battled ISIS to try and claw back territory lost to the extremists during the militants' blitz last year.

Police officials said a suicide bomber first struck a gathering of pro-government Sunni fighters near the town of al-Baghdadi, about 110miles (80km) north west of Baghdad, in the morning hours.

Soon after, ISIS militants attacked nearby army and police positions, setting off hours-long clashes. Police and hospital officials said 23 were killed and 28 were wounded in all on the government side. 

They did not give the death toll on the militants' side, saying only that the attackers 'sustained some casualties' and declining to provide further details.

In Baghdad, prime minister Haider Abadi pledged that Iraq's forces would retake all areas that fell to ISIS during last summer's stunning blitz.

'We will emerge as victorious and the day our lands are liberated is nearing,' Mr Abadi told a group of newly graduated army officers, speaking at the Military Academy as Iraq marked Army Day. 'Our goal ... is that peace and prosperity prevail in Iraq and end this dark period in Iraqi history.'
