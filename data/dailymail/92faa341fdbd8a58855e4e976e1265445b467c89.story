It was one of the first clues that the Duke and Duchess would be leaving the hospital with their little prince today: Kate's hair stylist arriving at the Lindo Wing.

Accompanied by her assistant - who was carrying a baby car seat and a dress - the royal stylist, who also does the hair of Prince William and Prince Harry - arrived at St Mary's Hospital in Paddington shortly before Kate's parents Carole and Michael Middleton.

Amanda Cook Tucker, 50, often styles Kate's hair at home and has been cutting William and Harry's hair for years - since they were children, in fact.

Amanda Cook Tucker, who has been Kate's hairdresser since the couple visited the Far East on a Diamond Jubilee Visit in September last year, wheeled a suitcase as she made her way into the rear entrance of the Lindo Wing.

Her young aide was carrying a Britax Baby-Safe Infant Carrier car seat, which retails from £80 online - the future king's first throne.

She also carried a dress beneath a protective dry-cleaning sheet - presumably the dress Kate will wear to greet the world for the first time since becoming a mother, and in which she will introduce us to her son.

Amanda Cook Tucker has become close to 
the Duchess of Cambridge in recent years: the stylist was credited with 
giving Kate heat-proof hair that defied the humid Asian weather when she toured the Far East with her husband on the Diamond Jubilee tour in 2012

With every aspect of her appearance is subject to intense scrutiny, when the Duchess of Cambridge appoints a hairdresser to look after her famous locks, it is not a decision taken lightly.

But Amanda is not exactly a stranger to Royal circles - having cut William and Harry's hair since they were children, she is also but known for her discretion and has always kept a low profile.

Her ex-husband Neville Tucker also has Royal connections: his
Knightsbridge salon held the Royal Warrant from 1980 to 1994 and he 
worked closely with the Queen’s longest-serving hairdresser, Charles 
Martyn.

Previously Kate was a long-term client of the Richard Ward celebrity salon in Chelsea.

Describing Amanda's work, one source told the Mail On Sunday: 'She’s a hard worker. Kate still goes to Richard Ward, she's very loyal that way, but doesn't always want to go into a salon. It can be a bit of an upheaval and she is often photographed going there.

'With Amanda she can have her hair done in the comfort of her own house. Amanda is an expert at what Kate loves - full glossy blow dries that hold.

Amanda was described by sources as 'indispensable' on the Far East tour.

The Prince of Wales paid the cost of Mrs Cook Tucker throughout the tour last autumn, believed to be £300 a day plus travel costs.

A spokesman for the Duchess at the time said: '‘The Duchess's hairdresser on the tour is a private individual paid for privately.'

One day he'll sit on a throne and rule the country. But for now, the new Prince of Cambridge will have to make do with a £80 car seat.

The Britax Baby-Safe Infant Carrier retails from £99.99 to £129.99

The first throne of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's newborn baby son will be a Britax Baby-Safe Infant Carrier, an award-winning car seat that retails from as little as £80 online to £129.99.

The seat was seen being carried into the Lindo Wing of St Mary's Hospital, Paddington, by the aide of Kate and William's hairdresser Amanda Cook Tucker, around 3pm, signalling that the new family are preparing to leave the hospital soon and head home.

The car seat won the Mother & Baby award for Best Buy in the infant car seat category in 2012, and is a favourite among new parents.

'The car seat is very safe, award-winning, and a great choice for newborns,' a Britax spokesman told MailOnline.

According to Britax: 'The lightweight Baby-Safe provides a secure travel solution for your baby from birth.

'They are secured by the 5-point safety harness and the deep, softly-padded side wings and head support add to your baby’s safety and comfort.

'The integral cushion allows your baby to lie in a more natural, comfortable position.'

European Managing Director, Ian Watson said: 'We can confirm the infant carrier pictured is from the Britax Baby-Safe infant carrier range.

'Britax, as a British brand and the leader in child travel safety, are delighted and honoured to hear that the Prince of Cambridge could be making his first journey in one of our infant carriers.

'We send our warmest wishes of health and happiness to TRH The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge as they begin their exciting journey in to parenthood.'

Incidentally, Britax also have a model 
called the King Plus, for babies over nine months old. We'll have to 
wait until 2014 to see him in that one.
