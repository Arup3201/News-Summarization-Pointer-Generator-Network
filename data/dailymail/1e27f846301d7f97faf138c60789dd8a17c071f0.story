Losing one striker looks unavoidable but the prospect of Wilfried Bony’s understudy also leaving Swansea is a headache Garry Monk could do without.

A season that began with a pair of impressive leading men could stutter if Bafetimbi Gomis’ representatives move beyond talking in their courtship of other clubs.

The striker revealed on Friday that ‘my agent has been speaking to one very big club’ and ‘it is nice to hear’ of outside interest, with Crystal Palace especially keen on the 29-year-old.

Gomis played a key role in Swansea’s equaliser on Saturday but those comments will have concerned Monk after Manchester City on Sunday agreed the £30million transfer fee for Bony.

Stewart Downing has been involved in 11 goals this season after his role in Andy Carroll’s opener. That is as many as he managed in the previous three seasons combined.

Gomis only arrived six months ago on a Bosman from Lyon, but Monk, for his part, is not worried about a potential striker crisis, especially as Swansea’s attention has already turned to Newcastle’s Papiss Cisse.

‘I am not bothered about quotes,’ said Monk, whose side claimed a point thanks to Mark Noble’s 74th-minute own goal which cancelled out Andy Carroll’s first-half opener.

‘I am only bothered about what people do for Swansea City. He has looked sharp, he has looked bright and you can see there is desire and a work ethic.

‘He is my No 1 striker . . . even if Wilfried stays, this is Bafe’s chance to stake a claim for that shirt and if he does well enough he will keep it.’
