An amphibious tourist bus sank into the freezing River Mersey freezing during a city tour.

Passengers had to be evacuated from the Yellow Duckmarine as it began sinking in the Albert Dock, in Liverpool.

Yellow Duckmarine bosses have now launched an investigation into the 'unfortunate incident'.

The colourful fleet are a well-known tourist attraction in Liverpool and tour the city from land and water.

Passengers were moved on to a pontoon when the vehicle began to sink at about 12.45pm on Saturday in accordance with safety procedures, a tour spokesman said.

The company has launched an internal inquiry into the cause and say they are keeping their remaining vehicles out of the water.Â 

Three of the four-strong fleet were today back on the streets of Liverpool but did not enter the dock waters.

Tourists were being offered 
reduced rates for the shortened version of the usual 55-minute - which 
takes in the historic Liver Buildings, St George's Hall and Chinatown.

Eyewitness Roger O'Doherty, who had been attending the NUT conference on Saturday, said: 'They got a tow boat to try and pull it onto the slipway but they were going quite quickly and it unhinged.

'The water was up to the level of the windows.'

Sales manager Paul Furlong praised the crew on board the boat for their professionalism.

He said: 'We have been running short road-only tours until the investigation is completed.

'It's
 still a fine tour but we're not charging the full amount. The incident 
was unfortunate and happened towards the end of the tour.'

Mr Furlong said there was no-one on board when the Duckmarine sank.

Dozens of people watched from the side of the dock as the Yellow Duckmarine tipped and began sinking

The rest of the fleet is being kept out of the water while an investigation is carried out into why the vehicle sank

He said: 'The vehicle only sank when it was being towed away and at that point the passengers were well away from the vessel.

'We are looking into what happened. Our crew are incredibly experienced and they acted very quickly. The crew followed the correct procedure.'

Ducks - which were originally called DUKWs when created in the US to transport men and materials during World War II - are no longer in production and each one still in use is accounted for.

Known as Wacker Quackers, they have become one of Liverpool's quirkiest visitor attractions.

Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip took a ride on the Yellow Duck during a visit to Merseyside Maritime Museum in May last year as part of her Diamond Jubilee celebrations.
