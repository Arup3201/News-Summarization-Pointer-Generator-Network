Susan Aflak was working punishing hours as an investment banker when a trip down to a lunch truck gave her an idea. If lunch could be delivered quickly and easily to her downtown LA office, why couldn't a manicure?

That lightbulb moment inspired her to quit her job in finance and launch La Lacquerie, the first on-demand mobile manicure truck catering to time-short professionals in need of a quick fix.

Based in San Francisco, a company can call to book the truck to park outside its office. La Lacquerie then pulls up curbside, and opens to employees or passers-by.

'When I was in banking I was working such crazy hours. I never had time to run beauty errands or do anything for myself,' the 33-year-old told MailOnline.

'Nails were the one thing I did for myself and it was always such a hassle to take my one Saturday or Sunday and schlep across town to get my nails done. But while I was working, I would run downstairs to food trucks all the time. I thought to myself, if only there was a way to combine the food truck model with beauty service.'

Aflak put together a business plan, purchased a 26ft Airstream trailer and even went back to beauty school to get her manicurist license. La Lacquerie was born in January 2014 and Aflak has been on a roll ever since.

Manicures in La Lacquerie's pink plush interior range from $16 to $38, with pedicures costing between $19 and $45. The manicures are full salon quality from top coat to base polish, and the pedicures are given 'dry' with a hot towel wrap to soften the skin.

'A lot of salons skimp out. They'll use the nice polish but everything else is lower quality' Aflak explained. 'Our products are all top-quality salon products. The polishes are OPI and Essie.'

Up to three nail technicians are on-site at all times ready to accommodate walk ins, and Aflak herself even pitches in.

'I'm on the trailer at all times doing work. I oversee the nail techs, I roll up my sleeves and do services when we're busy. I check people in, I check people out, I help people pick colors. I also do all the finance and accounting for the business,' she said.

The truck is a large part of what immediately brought La Lacquerie attention. Aflak spent a year renovating the gigantic 1960s trailer she purchased on Craigslist, and installed plush seating, pink curtains and a crystal chandelier. 

'People love the Airstream - I think that sets us apart,' Aflak says. It was a challenge to get the power running, and getting the trailer up to the California Board of Barbering and Cosmetology's standards took time, but once complete, word about La Lacquerie traveled fast.

'Silicon Valley is a big place, but word travels so quickly' Aflak said. 'Once people started posting [on social media] the requests started coming in.'

La Lacquerie is now regularly parked at Google, Gap, Facebook, EA and YouTube. There's even a waitlist for the trailer, and Aflak has begun sending nail techs to conference rooms to perform manicure meetings.

No additional salon services are available at the moment (such as eyebrow waxing or massage), but that is definitely in phase two or three Aflak confirmed. 'Hopefully it will all come soon,' she says. 'We just have the one truck at the moment.'

Trucks may eventually roll into other cities, too. 'We're still a young company, so I'm trying to get us self sufficient here and then we can focus on expansion.' But 'expansion is definitely always in the back of my head' Aflak admits. In the meantime, she may need to hire more drivers. 

'Driving the 26-foot trailer is the craziest part of my morning, but I've gotten used to it. I'm working for myself and I love my job.'
