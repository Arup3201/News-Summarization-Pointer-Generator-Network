David Cameron was heckled and mocked by an audience of elderly voters he was hoping to convince to vote for the Conservatives.

Pensioners shouted ‘rubbish’, ‘lies’, and ‘answer the question’ - and one waved his walking stick at the Prime Minister - as he was challenged about spending on social care and agency workers employed by the NHS.

Mr Cameron had given a speech outlining his commitment to annual rises in the state pension, protecting the health budget and entitlements to free TV licences and bus passes.

David Cameron speaks with members of the charity Age UK during a ‘General Election rally’ in central London, in which the Prime Minister ended up being heckled by the audience for spending on social care

The AgeUK event in London yesterday descended into chaos as pensioners in the audience repeatedly called out, branding the Prime Minister's answers 'rubbish' and accusing him of not answering their questions

He finished his address to a ‘General Election rally’ held by the charity Age UK in central London by urging the audience to ‘choose what’s right for our children and grandchildren’ by voting Conservative.

But in a combative question and answer session, many of the pensioners were deeply unimpressed by his answers.

Alfred Clemo, 86, was angry at not getting a ‘straight answer’ after he asked Mr Cameron what he would do about the number of NHS doctors and nurses leaving to work for agencies for higher salaries.

Mr Cameron said it was a ‘difficult issue’ as hospitals hired agency staff to deal with extra pressure, particularly on A&E departments. ‘The truth of it, Sir, is that well-run hospitals are less reliant on agency staff’ the Prime Minister said.

‘We need to make sure all hospitals copy the best hospitals that are less reliant on agency staff.’

He tried to move on, but Mr Clemo, a retired garage owner from Warrington who is a governor of his local hospital, replied: ‘Excuse me, you haven’t answered my question’ and repeated it.

Mr Cameron said that he could not stop health service staff looking for a ‘better deal’, to jeers and cries of ‘rubbish’ and ‘answer the question’ from the audience. The Prime Minister pleaded: ‘I am answering the question, I don’t want to ban agency nurses as then hospitals that were struggling wouldn’t be able to get hold of them.’

It was revealed earlier this week that hospitals are paying locum doctors up to £3,200 a shift – of which a substantial cut goes to the agency. NHS trusts spent £1.2bn on agency staff in 2013-14 – with agency nurses being paid up to £160 an hour to make up for staff shortages in A&E.

Mr Clemo, said afterwards that without action to stop agency staff being paid double the rate of normal staff his local hospital ‘will be bankrupt in two years’. 

He said: ‘The agencies are getting mega-rich out of fleecing the hospital. It is ruining the NHS.’ He said he had voted Conservative and Labour in the past, and added ‘He would have won me back if he had answered my question’.

Dennis Andrews, 91, was called on after waving his walking stick at the Prime Minister. He said older people had to deal with too many departments and agencies and were often ‘given the run-around’.

‘I would like a minister at cabinet level to coordinate all these agencies that make these decisions in isolation’, he said. ‘We deserve the same recognition you give to children’, to shouts of ‘hear, hear’.

Mr Cameron said older people should be a priority for ‘all ministers’, to loud groans from the audience. 

The Prime Minister added: ‘If you are not satisfied with how elderly people are being looked after and valued by this government, don’t blame other ministers, blame me’, he said. Several people shouted back at him, ‘we do’.

His appearance at the meeting in central London yesterday was mocked on social media – coming a day after Mr Cameron announced his retirement, by saying he would not seek a third term in office. 

Commenters on twitter said he had bruised by ‘leaving the Westminster bubble’ and that he had ‘aged five years’ in the process.

Earlier this week, Cameron announced he would not bid for a third term if he is successful in May's General Election. He has since insisted he is taking 'nothing for granted' and his focus is on beating 'Ed Miliband'

Mr Andrews, a retired manager at a distilling firm, runs the Nottingham Elders’ Forum, a small charity which helps older people drive improvements to local services.

He said afterwards that he was ‘non-political’, but that Mr Cameron’s government had ‘not really’ done a lot for pensioners. 

He said: ‘I contributed for 40 years for my old age pension, and they talk about it as a benefit’, he said. ‘It’s not a benefit, I’ve paid in for it. They say it’s gone up by 5 per cent, well 5 per cent increase on nothing is nothing. It’s still only £113 a week.’

Another audience member, who did not give his name, asked Mr Cameron for a ‘cast iron guarantee’ that spending on health and social care were ‘safe at the present level’ if he was elected.

Mr Cameron said ‘yes’, but shouts of ‘lies’ and ‘it’s not true’ were heard from the audience. Mr Cameron said: ‘We’ve put an extra £12.7billion into the NHS in this parliament. We have promised not to cut it, we will put more money into the NHS every year that I am Prime Minister.’

Maureen Childs, of the Green party’s pensioners group accused Mr Cameron of wanting to introduce health insurance and ‘we want the NHS as it used to be – free at the point of use’. Mr Cameron insisted: ‘It is free at the point of use’.

The rally was addressed by politicians from all the major parties.

The Prime Minister – who said he was the only party leader to come to the conference - tried to put a brave face on the event saying it had been ‘fun’ and thanked the pensioners for their ‘lively interactions’.
