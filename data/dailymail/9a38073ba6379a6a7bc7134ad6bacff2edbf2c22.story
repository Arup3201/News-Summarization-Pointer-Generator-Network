Families are spending too much time using technology and not enough talking round the dinner table, a Government adviser has warned.

Reg Bailey, chief executive of the Mothers’ Union, said parents are letting ‘screens take over’ from family time, blaming the rising popularity of smartphones and tablets, such as iPads.

Mr Bailey, who carried out a review into the sexualisation and commercialisation of childhood for David Cameron three years ago, said British parents are among those in Europe most likely to neglect their children.

Reg Bailey, chief executive at the Mother's Union, said not enough British families sit around the table for a family meal and tend to sit in front of the television instead

‘It does worry me that the amount of time that parents spend with children in the UK is also one of the relatively lower ones within Europe,’ he said.

‘I wonder if we are leaving children too much to their own devices as opposed to spending time with them, and therefore screens take over.’

Mr Bailey said a 2011 Unicef study that monitored families in Spain, Sweden and the UK had shown British parents spend far less time talking to their children than their European counterparts do.

‘What was really noticeable was how few of the British families had a dining table or a kitchen table,’ he told The Independent.

‘They tended to sit around the television and eat meals on on their laps, whereas both the Swedish and the Spanish families had a meal round the table and spent a lot of time just talking.’

He added: ‘I think it perhaps tells you something about the amount of face-to-face time which is spent in British families.

Mr Cameron wants music videos to be given age ratings to help protect children 

‘People talk sometimes about “quality time”, and actually I think most children don’t really need quality time. They need you to be there to talk informally all the time.’

He also told the paper that he feels retail stores should be given stickers according to how ‘family friendly’ their products are.

Mr Bailey was commissioned to lead a review into how to protect children from an increasingly sexualised society shortly after the last election.

Mr Cameron last week announced that online music videos will be given age ratings to help protect children from highly sexual and violent content, which was one of Mr Bailey’s recommendations.

The Prime Minister said families were ‘endlessly worried’ about what their children could find on the internet as he announced the crackdown on sleazy music videos.

During his speech, Mr Cameron said that he was concerned as a parent about how much ‘screen time’ his own children – Nancy, ten, Elwen, eight, and three-year-old Florence – have.

He said: ‘As for my own children, I am sure there are times when they have been disappointed because they haven’t been able to do something or see something.

‘But that is part of what being a parent is about, being able to deploy the use of the word “no” and even sometimes to deploy the use of the off switch on the television, as unpopular as that might be – and sometimes ineffectual because they find another screen somewhere that is switched on.’
