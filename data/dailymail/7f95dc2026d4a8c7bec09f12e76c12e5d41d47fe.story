A stray donkey suffered third degree burns after being doused in petrol and set on fire.

The animal had wandered into a field in the Palestinian village of Immaten when it was attacked by a local boy.

Fur on its back and abdomen had been almost totally burned off and its skin was raw and blistered.

The donkey was rescued days later after villagers called the charity Safe Haven For Donkeys In The Holy Land.

And after months of treatment he is almost completely recovered and has made friends with a dog who lives at the donkey sanctuary.

Safe Haven named him Burnie to remind staff and volunteers what he has been through.

The charity's founder and field director Lucy Fensom said when she went to collect him she was 'horrified' at the scale of his injuries.

She said Burnie was so traumatised by his ordeal that he was 'visibly shaking' and it took some time to coax him into a horse box.

A charity spokeswoman said: 'When the poor little donkey arrived at the sanctuary, the extent of his injuries soon became clear, his whole back and abdomen had 3rd degree burns.'

Burnie was put into a separate enclosure so the other donkeys did not accidentally knock his skin as it healed.

For several months, Burnie's bandages were removed and his wounds were treated with fluid antibiotic and 100 per cent pure honey.

The charity said honey was used as it kills antibiotic-resistant organisms and helps skin heal.

He was also fitted with a special head collar made from a bucket to stop him biting himself as his itchy skin healed.

A charity spokeswoman said: 'These days Burnie is like a different donkey.

'Tufts of fur have grown back and although he still lives in an enclosure of his own to protect him from the boisterous members of the donkey herd, he enjoys being near the entrance to the sanctuary, greeting visitors with a bray and a nuzzle.

'He is also taken for a daily walk alongside Lucy’s dog Cadbury and seems to think he is a very large dog himself.'

Ms Fensom founded the charity, which is supported by Animal Friends Insurance, in 2001 and since then it has treated more than 10,000 horses, mules and donkeys in Israel and the Palestinian territories.

It also runs an education programme and free mobile vet clinics to teach people how to care for the working animals.

Elaine Fairfax, managing director of Animal Friends Pet Insurance, said: 'It was heartbreaking to hear about Burnies’ horrific injuries, but seeing him on the road to recovery is simply wonderful and something we’re proud to have been able to support, as well as the other donkeys at Safe haven.'
