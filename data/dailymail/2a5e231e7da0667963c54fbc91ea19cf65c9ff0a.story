Jonathan Joseph delivered another world class performance at Twickenham on Saturday

England

Mike Brown (rep Twelvetrees 13 mins) – N/A

Horrible injury saw the England full back knocked unconscious after collision with Masi. Would be unfair to mark.

Anthony Watson – 7

A couple of hot-stepping bursts but England were unable to release the Bath flyer in space. Saved late try.

Jonathan Joseph – 9

His second world-class contribution in successive weeks. Two brilliantly taken tries and a permanent attacking threat. 

Joseph touched down fro two tries and was a constant attacking threat fro England

Luther Burrell – 6

An early interception did not help confidence but was assured when he moved to outside centre after Brown went off. 

Jonny May – 4

Bombed a golden first-half chance with two players outside and kicking game also wayward.

George Ford (Cipriani 62 mins) – 7

Very tidy. Just looks at home at this level. Nothing spectacular but assured again.

George Ford looked assured again and his kicking, in the main, was reliable

Ben Youngs (Wigglesworth 66 mins) – 8

His second strong contribution in succession. Sniped well and linked effectively with Ford.

Joe Marler (Vunipola 62 mins) – 7

Excellent scrummaging which we have come to expect. Not as prominent in loose.

Dylan Hartley (rep Youngs 58 mins) – 7

Missed an early line-out throw but scrummaged well and worked tirelessly at the breakdown. 

Mike Brown took a sickening blow leaving him knocked out and carried off on a stretcher after 12 minutes

Dan Cole (rep Brookes 58 mins) – 7

Two impressive returns for the Leicester tighthead who has exceeded expectations after a lengthy lay off.

Dave Attwood (rep Easter 56 mins) – 6

Early line-out steal settled nerves but not as dominant as he can be before being replaced. 

George Kruis – 8

Outstanding contribution from a young lock looking more and more at home on international stage. Incredible work-rate. 

George Kruis put in another assured performance as the young lock looks at home on international stage

James Haskell (Croft 62 mins) – 7

Not as prominent as he was against Wales but still a decent day’s work from powerful Wasp.

Chris Robshaw (c) – 8

Vital first-half turnover allowed Joseph to scorch in from inside half. Typically selfless contribution.

Billy Vunipola – 7

Carried superbly, especially in second quarter. Worked tirelessly and was effective once again.
