It's a classic Australian saying: 'G'day mate, how you going?'. But when one Australian traveller tried to get American's to repeat it, many were lost for words.

Kieran Murray, from Brisbane in Queensland, recently spent months travelling across the US, and documented his interactions with locals all around the country.

From a homeless man who was insistent upon telling his story about Britney Spears, to a man who insisted Murray was saying 'Get out of my nightgown', the filmmaker captured it all.

Aussie filmmaker Kieran Murray has released the second installment of his hilarious series which asks Americans to attempt the Australian accent by saying 'G'day mate, how you going?

One man in Austin, Texas (far right) was convinced Murray said 'Get out (of) my nightgown'

This is the latest in a series of videos Murray put together one of which is based around the same topic, and another of which asks people to guess what common Australian expressions mean.

'I don't even know what he said!' exclaimed one Texan when asked by the Brisbane man to repeat the phrase.

'Say it again in English?', asked a man in Manhattan, New York.

'Sounds Chinese to me man,' he later added. 

Many people threw strange sideways glances at the man, trying to understand what he was saying, with one man declaring 'that's Spanish!'. 

Others erupted into fits of laughter as they tried to translate the classic Australian vernacular, and Murray also ran into one very talkative man intent on repeating he used to live in the back of Britney Spears' dads house.

One man in Nashville responded with an incomprehensible sentence while trying his hand at the Aussie accent

This man, who didn't quite get the gist of the question, was insistent on telling a story about Britney Spears

'I lived in the back, of Britney Spears' dads house', the man, who appears to be homeless, told the filmaker over and over again.

When he was asked again to repeat the phrase after Murray, he simply said: 'All right'. 

While on the subway Murray asked one man to repeat what he said, but he simply declared 'Can't do it'.

'I don't know what you said, were those words?' one woman, who appeared to be at a sporting event, asked the Australian.

'What the hell'd you say?' exclaimed one hog hunter in Texas.

Kids giggled as they tried to understand what Murray was saying in his Australian accent

Many times the filmmaker was met with strange glances from confused Americans

Children weren't much better and translating the popular Aussie phrase, but the best of the bunch came from a shirtless man in Austin, Texas.

'Wait I got this,' the man said while surrounded by his friends before triumphantly proclaiming: 'Get out my nightgown!'.

'That's the one. Get out my nightgown. I got it right, I already know I got it,' the man said.

Murray even managed to stump a speech therapist who struggled to understand the Australian accent. 

The video, aptly titled 'G'day Mate: The Sequel' can be viewed in full on Murray's YouTube page.
