A laptop helped save a 56-year-old man's life after an arrow was fired at him outside his NSW home allegedly by his wife's ex-partner who flew from America with the crossbow to kill him.Â 

Greg Williams was carrying the laptop on his driveway at Somersby on the Central Coast when he was shot at with the loaded crossbow on Tuesday afternoon.

The arrow fired by Texas man Jeffrey Hooten, 49, struck the lid of the laptop computer Mr Williams was holding instead of directly piercing his skin.

Hooten then allegedly attacked Mr Williams with an axe, which he struck over the victim's head.

Mr Williams told Nine News he was extremely lucky after he was taken to hospital suffering a head wound.

'The gods were with me,' he said.

'I could have been dead and my wife could have been dead.'

Details of the attempt on Mr Williams' life were revealed in Gosford Local Court on Wednesday where the 49-year-old appeared on attempted murder charges.

The court heard the American had travelled to Australia on July 8 without the knowledge of any of his family on a mission to murder the husband of his former wife, Stephanie Williams.

As well as the crossbow, he brought with him knives and a piece of wire.

He checked into a motel in Gosford, north of Sydney, and travelled to Mr Williams' home on Tuesday afternoon.

Court documents reveal that Hooten arrived in Australia last week and had a pre-booked flight home this Friday.

Hooten divorced Mrs Williams in 2009 and contact between them was limited.

The case has been adjourned until September.
