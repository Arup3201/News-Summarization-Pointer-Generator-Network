A young seal was eager to hang out with a couple of surfers on a UK beach – joining them as riding the waves for more than an hour.

Matt Stanley and friend Andrew Flounders got a massive surprise when the adventurous animal interrupted their session near Amble in Northumberland.

The pair had been out on the water enjoying the summer waves when Andrew suddenly felt something nudging his foot.

They had installed a camera on one of the boards, which captured the seal playfully splashing in and out of the water.

The two-and-a-half-minute footage show the animal not only swimming up to the surfers, but also clambering on Matt's board.

The seal splashes in and out of the waves, flipping from one board to the other – even going in for an extreme close up.

Surfers Matt Stanley and Andrew Flounders were amazed as the seal hopped on one of their surfboards

Matt said: ‘The look on his face was classic. He got such a fright because he didn't know what it was.

‘Once we realised it was a seal we relaxed a bit.’

The video also shows the surfers heading out of the water – with the cute pup following closely behind.
