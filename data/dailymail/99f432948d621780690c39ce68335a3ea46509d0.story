The man who was attacked by a polar bear last month in a Canadian national park, is back home in Maine and set to undergo jaw surgery today.

Matthew Dyer flew into Lewsiton last Tuesday after spending three weeks recovering at a Montreal hospital from a polar bear attack at his camp in Torngat National Park on July 24.

Thanks to the quick actions of his camping group, he miraculously survived and is back at his home in Turner, Maine.

Dyer, a lawyer for Pine Tree Legal Services, was attacked during a Sierra Club guided tour of the Torngat Mountains National Park in the far Northern Labrador Mountains.

Dyer's primary fear before going on the trip was that he wouldn't be physically fit enough. He trained all winter to make sure he would be able to cover the terrain.

Polar bears are rampant in the park during the summer months when the melted ice confines them to land. But Dyer was unconcerned about the polar bears.

Plus his group had an electrified fence used to surround the camp at night and keep the bears out. He even saw a few on the trip before the attack. One morning they witnessed a mother out with her baby cub.

'My god, they are cute, like a little stuffed animal,' Dyer told the Bangor Daily News. 'Then we had another big boy that came in and sat and watched us for a bit. We had to fire a flare at him to chase him off.'

But somehow the fence failed because a bear slipped through on July 24 while the rest of the camp was sleeping. Dyer was awake and saw the bear through his one-person tent.

He yelled 'Bear in the camp! Bear in the camp!' before the beast latched onto his neck and wouldn't let go.

Contrary to early reports by his wife that he fought back, Dyer says he did no such thing. His body went limp and he gave in.

'I thought I was dead,' he said. 'I could hear the bones crunching back in my head where he was chewing on me. I could see the bear’s legs. I was kind of under this belly with big white legs — no doubt what it was. I remember thinking to myself, it’s gotta happen to everyone. This is my time.'

And then he saw the light. His group shot off flares at the bear as he was dragging Dyer down to the beach and the beast lost it's grip.

Dyer believes it must have been a younger bear since an older one probably wouldn't have dropped him.

His group carried Dyer back to the camp and performed what first-aid they could while they waited for emergency responders to arrive.

It was a long wait. They were unable to communicate with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police's telecommunications center until 6:30 a.m. the next morning.

Seven hours after the attack a helicopter arrived take Dyer and a doctor form the group to a base in Northern Quebec that had a trauma clinic. They were later transferred by fixed-wing aircraft to Montreal General Hospital for further treatment.

The rest of the group was left with an Inuit - the only people allowed to carry guns in the park.

While Dyer suffered severe injuries to his back and head, it could have been a lot worse since the bear's bite didn't cause any spinal chord damage.

'If he had bitten any other way, I think I would have been dead,' Dyer said. 'Either I would have had a stroke or been paralyzed. But now, here I am, sitting in Turner. It’s pretty nice.'

Dyer's wife Jeanne Wells is glad her husband is home safe and sound. Wells was informed of the attack the afternoon after it happened and flew into Montreal to be by her husband as he recovered.

‘The Canadians did an amazing job of getting him transported. There was a doctor in the group who took care of him right from the start,' she said.

A spokesperson for the park said this is the first time an attack like this has happened since it opened in 2005.

'There are high densities of bears in the park and you are at very high risk of encountering a bear. That said, this is the only incident we have had of this seriousness since the park was established,' said Peter Deering, manager of resource conservation for Parks Canada in Western Newfoundland and Labrador.

Torngat National Park is a 3,700-square-mile Canadian National Park located on the Northern Labrador Mountains in Newfoundland and is home to seal-hunting polar bears, caribou and remnant glaciers. 

Dyer is expected to make a full recovery.
