During the Ordovician period 470 million years ago life on Earth thrived, but why?

It's a question scientists have struggled to answer, but now an ancient meteorite found in a quarry in Sweden could be the missing link that explains what happened.

The fossilised space rock is thought to be the remains of one of two asteroids that crashed between Jupiter and Mars, the debris of which later bombarded Earth and kickstarted the variation of life.

Scientists say they may have found the 'missing link' that explains the biodiversity of life on Earth 470 million years ago. The 'mysterious object' (right) was found at the Thorsberg quarry in Sweden (left). The meteorite is 8 × 6.5 × 2 centimetres in size. It was found in the youngest quarried bed of the Thorsberg quarry

The find was made at Thorsberg quarry, where about 100 other fossil meteorites have also been found before.

The Ordovician period covers the time on Earth between 485 and 443 million years ago.

During those 45 million years the area north of the tropics was almost entirely ocean.

Most of the world’s land, meanwhile, was part of a southern supercontinent called Gondwana.

The period is synonymous with a general biodiversity of life on Earth - in the early Ordovician period life on Earth thrived.

The reason for this is unknown, but some theories suggest the arrival of meteorites such as the L chondrites could have kickstarted the resurgence.

It wasn’t all fun and games during the Ordovician period, though - towards its end massive glaciers formed on Gondwana as it shifted towards the South Pole.

This drained shallow seas and caused sea levels to drop, ultimately resulting in the mass extinction of 60 per cent of marine invertebrates on Earth.

Another theory for the mass extinction, however, suggests a ten-second gamma ray burst blasted Earth’s atmosphere, exposing life to deadly levels of radiation.

The international team of researchers in their paper published in Earth and Planetary Science Letters, however, say this particular rock is unlike anything ever found.

And it could be the 'missing link' for an asteroid collision that had previously been thought to have been vapourised.

Over 500 million years ago a small asteroid crashed into a larger one between Jupiter and Mars.

This impact resulted in the creation of many fragments that eventually bombarded Earth 470 million years ago.

These fragments are known as L chrondrites, and they are the second most common type of meteorite on the planet.

It's believed these impacts may have kickstarted the resurgence of biodiversity on planet Earth, when life became more varied and complex.

This occurred during the Ordovician period, prior to which biodiversity had gone through a lull.

However, while the meteorites are thought to be the remains of the larger asteroid, scientists had been puzzled as to why there was no sign of the smaller asteroid.

Until now, no evidence of the other asteroid had been found on Earth, putting a damper on the theory.

Some had suggested the second asteroid simply vapourised on impact.

The meteorite is thought to be the second of two asteroids that collided between Jupiter and Mars 470 million years ago. Evidence for the larger one has already been found in the form of L chondrite meteorites, the second most common meteorites on Earth, but this new find is the first evidence for the other asteroid in the collision

The meteorite found in Sweden has reignited interest, however, because it's possible it is a piece of that second asteroid, as it appears to have been part of the same meteor shower as the L chondrites.

If true, it will add a great deal of credence to the entire theory that seeks to explain the sudden resurgence of life during the early part of the Ordovician period.

The meteorite was found by quarry workers three years ago.

Other meteorites have been found in the same quarry before, but all of them were L chondrites.

This new rock was different from the others the researchers noted after studying its crystals, but was in the same rock layer and dating in the lab, suggesting it arrived during the same time period as part of a wider meteor shower.

While still in the same class of primitive achondrites as L chondrites, it's not exactly the same because of small differences in its elemental composition.

The team is hopeful that the finding suggests that others will be found, hopefully some that can offer more evidence of their origin.

The unique meteorite has not been given an official name yet - for now it's simply being referred to as the 'mysterious object'.

And it could just be the missing link that explains one of Earth's greatest mysteries.

Scientists in Sweden have found a rock that may explain Earth's biodiversity

@highlight

The discovery is thought to be one of two asteroids that collided in space

@highlight

These asteroids crashed into each other between Jupiter and Mars

@highlight

The larger of the two formed L chondrites, the second most common type of meteorite on Earth

@highlight

These are also thought to have kickstarted the biodiviersity of life on Earth 470 million years ago

@highlight

No evidence for the second asteroid had been found, though, calling the theory under scrutiny

@highlight

But this new find could be the first evidence for the other in the collision
