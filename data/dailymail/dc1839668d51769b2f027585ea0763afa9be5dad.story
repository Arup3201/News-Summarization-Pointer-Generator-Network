Raheem Sterling has played for only 38 minutes in three warm-up games but his thrilling displays in training are fuelling the idea that the teenage winger can give England an added dimension at the World Cup.

Liverpool team-mate Glen Johnson is among those who believe Sterling might be a secret weapon, having been under wraps, due to the red card soon after he came on against Ecuador and which banned him from the 0-0 draw against Honduras.

'That would be ideal, if people don’t know what he’s capable of and underestimate him a bit,' said Johnson.

'That would definitely work in our favour. Hopefully people will underestimate him and then he can prove them wrong.

'He was on fire in training on Friday and he looks like he has been around the squad for years. When he gets on the ball you can see he has learnt the game quickly and he can hurt teams. He’s probably the quickest in the squad over 10 yards.

'He has looked good all year. He’s a young kid who is willing to learn about the game and he should just get better.'

Sterling may yet be an asset weapon best used from the bench against teams drained by the heat anticipated in some parts of Brazil, including Manaus where England open the Group D fixtures against Italy on Saturday.

With Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain still an injury doubt for the tournament, Sterling is expected to feature at some point in the group games.

Like Sterling, the Ox was also at the Sun Life Stadium to watch the Honduras game. He has been able to walk around at times this weekend without a protective knee brace, but it was strapped on last night as the squad left the arena for the airport.

Roy Hodgson has until Friday to decide if Oxlade-Chamberlain, ruled out for an estimated two weeks after straining ligaments against Ecuador on Wednesday, will stay in Brazil for the tournament or be replaced.

If the initial diagnosis proves accurate he could be fit for the final group game against Costa Rica on June 24, but if it takes a little longer, Hodgson may yet choose to replace him. He will be closely monitored and his team-mates are trying to keep his spirits up.

'He is well in with the squad, well in with the lads and we try and keep him as happy as possible,' said Johnson, one of the team’s elders, winning his 52nd cap against Honduras.

'He is just as involved as he was apart from the training sessions. There are still a few question marks around how bad it is and how quickly he can recover.

'He will be gutted and we are gutted for him because you don’t want to be picking up injuries now. I am sure he will be mentally strong and we will be by his side. He was great the other night and you don’t want to lose any player especially with the quality he has got.'

Hope: Despite the injury England medical staff remain hopeful about Oxlade-Chamberlain's chances

The emergence of fresh young players like the Ox and Sterling have encouraged Johnson to believe England can impress at the World Cup, with more attacking threat than at Euro 2012, when they lost to Italy on penalties in a quarter final.

'We had a good team when we played Italy last time, but now we have more players who can hurt them,' said the Liverpool full-back. 'We have a bit more pace in the squad as well so hopefully we will get further on.

'I don’t think Italy will have met an England team like this before. The team we had before was a good side but maybe it was slightly defensive. If we can defend well now and use some of the pace and ability we have going forward we can cause problems.'
