A ceiling collapse at a West End 
theatre which injured 80 audience members was caused by ‘the 
deterioration’ of century-old cloth and plaster ties holding up timber 
frames, it has been revealed. 

The
 Grade II-listed Apollo Theatre will re-open tomorrow for the first 
time since 10 sq yards of plaster fell on to the stalls below in a 
performance of The Curious Incident Of The Dog In The Night-Time.

The
 ties, made of hessian and plaster of Paris, were used to lash together 
timber frames to support the suspended ceiling - and had been in place 
since the theatre opened in 1901. 

Emergency situation: A fire brigade truck waits outside the Apollo Theatre in London on December 20 last year, one day after the ceiling collapse - caused by century-old cloth and plaster ties, according to investigators

Probe: The Apollo Theatre will re-open for the first time since about 10 sq yards of plaster plummeted on to the stalls below, injuring 80 people, during a performance of The Curious Incident Of The Dog In The Night-Time

Westminster
 Council insisted ‘guidance’ would be issued to other theatres and 
historic buildings built with similar materials, following the incident 
on December 19 last year. 

A 
spokesman said: ‘Our investigation is still ongoing, however our inquiry
 to date has led us to understand why the ceiling at the Apollo Theatre 
failed in December.  

‘The 
principal cause was the deterioration over time of wadding ties which 
supported the ceiling, thought to be in place since its construction in 
1901.’ 

The council said as a
 result of the finding it will be issuing guidance to owners of historic
 buildings, English Heritage, the National Trust and others regarding 
ongoing maintenance of similar ceilings.

‘Theatre-goers
 can be reassured that, as a precaution, we are working closely with the
 Society of London Theatre to roll out this guidance across the theatre 
community,’ the spokesman added.

She
 said the council’s guidance ‘outlines what precautions owners can take 
to ensure the safety of this ornate plasterwork, including thorough 
checks of suspended ceilings of a similar construction in order to 
preserve the unique heritage of our great London theatres and historic 
buildings’. 

The council - 
whose probe is likely to conclude later in the spring - has confirmed 
the theatre, due to open tomorrow with an adaptation of the 
vampire movie Let The Right One In, is safe.

Building
 safety body Structural Safety has raised concerns in recent years about
 the need for regular checks on the ceilings of performance venues in 
the UK.

'Owners of entertainment buildings have to ensure that their structures, including the ceilings, are regularly inspected and maintained'

Dr Alastair Soane, Structural-Safety

The organisation has
 reported on previous instances of ceiling problems and pointed to Home 
Office recommendations in 1955 for cinema safety, prompted by failures 
in plasterwork. 

The director
 of Structural-Safety, Dr Alastair Soane, said: ‘Owners of entertainment
 buildings have to ensure that their structures, including the ceilings,
 are regularly inspected and maintained.’ 

Many of London's theatres date from the same Edwardian era as the Apollo.
