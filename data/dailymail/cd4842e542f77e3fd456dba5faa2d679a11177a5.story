For the past three years, 99-year-old Lillian Weber has been making a new dress for a child in need every single day.

Mrs Weber, who lives in a farmhouse in Bettendorf, Iowa, has created more than 840 frocks for a Christian nonprofit group called Little Dresses for Africa.

She hopes to make 1,000 dresses for impoverished girls before she turns 100 on May 6, 2015.

'I could probably make two a day, but I only make one,' she told Iowa's WQAD News 8.

'I have to be busy. It’s just one of those things you learn how to do and enjoy,' she modestly added.

Her daughter, Linda Purcell, said that she personalizes every dress, observing: 'It’s not good enough that she makes the dresses; she has to put something on the front to make it look special, to give it her mark.'

Mrs Weber starts each dress in the morning, takes a midday break and then adds the final touches in the afternoon.

Her
 daughters deliver the garments to an apartment complex for seniors in 
Davenport, Iowa, where they're sent to the organization along with dresses made by residents.

'When I get to that thousand, if I’m able to, I won’t quit - I’ll go at it again,' Ms Weber said.

'It is just what I like to do,' she told the Quad-City Times in May.

Little Dresses for Africa, founded in 2008, has received more than 2.5 million dresses from all 50 states, plus the U.K., Ireland, Canada, Mexico and Australia, according to the Michigan-based organization's website.

Founder Rachel O’Neill tells MailOnline that she plans to deliver some of Mrs Weber's dresses herself when she visits Malawi on September 18.

The nonprofit has distributed dresses to orphanages, churches, and schools in 47 countries throughout Africa.
