Boris Johnson does not want to be Wayne Rooney, a star player who carries out someone else’s plan. He intends to be Louis van Gaal, the star manager who arrives on a mission to take the team back to the top of the league.

But the Conservatives already have a manager. He is called David Cameron, and he has been running the side since 2005. Last week he sent a tweet from his holiday deckchair: ‘Great news that Boris plans to stand at next year’s General Election – I’ve always said I want my star players on the pitch.’

Cameron is making the best of what both for him and his party is an extremely dangerous situation. The Conservatives are in a concealed state of mutiny. Many backbenchers think Cameron is a hopeless leader, and would like nothing better than to get rid of him and his henchman, George Osborne.

A spontaneous uprising would be unlikely to succeed. The mutiny requires a leader. This is the significance of the return of Boris: he is coming aboard as the man with the dash, the subversiveness and the acute sense of timing needed to overthrow Cameron.

Boris also has a growing band of sympathisers who could coalesce into something really formidable. The reshuffle confirmed to a large number of Tory MPs that they have nothing to hope for from the present leadership.

I cannot break confidences. So let me just say how moving I found it, a day or two before the reshuffle took place, to be told by a Tory MP of his outstanding suitability for the post of Minister of State for Paperclips. Alas, the paperclips job went to a woman who always does what Osborne tells her. Paperclip (as I have decided to call the MP in order to preserve his anonymity) got on the blower to Boris.

And what a sympathetic hearing he received from the Mayor of London.

I am happy to report that Paperclip has gone off on holiday with a spring in his step. For he is under the impression that Boris has every intention of offering him a job commensurate with his talents, as soon as the present ministerial team can be got rid of.

Boris’s enemies go around asking whether he can be trusted. It is a good question, but it also betrays a failure to understand what is going on. For in order to lead a successful uprising, you need in some respects to be untrustworthy.

Boris by temperament is an outsider, a maverick. He cannot see a red button marked ‘Danger – Do Not Press’ without wanting to press it. Cameron would rather see politics as a game of football in which everyone is obliged to obey the rules. 

But Tory politics over the next year or two may turn out to be more like Mutiny On The Bounty, with Cameron as Captain Bligh and Boris as Fletcher Christian, the leader of the mutineers.

The time may not be far off when Cameron, Osborne and their followers are lowered over the side into an open boat, while Boris takes command of the ship.

But the time for this parting of the ways has not yet come. Cameron and Osborne have the chance to achieve in 2015 the victory which eluded them in 2010. Any Conservative who disrupts the General Election campaign will not be forgiven.

Boris has accepted the logic of this. He is going to be the most loyal member of the Conservative campaign one could hope to find.

But his loyalty will often be so exaggerated as to amount to a form of subversion.

As he said when asked about the General Election in his first newspaper interview after announcing his intention to stand: ‘The big story is going to be Dave.’ Which other leading Conservative dares call the Prime Minister ‘Dave’?

And how big a story will Dave be when he tells us for the umpteenth time about the wonders of ‘Our Long-Term Economic Plan?’ Journalists condemned to cover this stuff will instead flock to see Boris, in the hope that he will say something more amusing.

The critics will try to suggest that because Boris does not have an ideology, he is somehow unworthy to engage in politics. But ideology can lead to appalling blunders.

What Boris has is a set of powerfully conservative instincts, which he applies in the light of circumstances.

I nevertheless believe he is a bit hurt by the claim that he has nothing much to say about policy. Hence his assembly at City Hall of a team who can feed him the ammunition he needs for his leadership bid.

People such as Gerard Lyons, who became the Mayor’s chief economic adviser. Lyons supplied the research Boris last week used to place pressure on Cameron to adopt a tougher negotiating position in Europe.

But Boris did not himself get bogged down in technicalities. He instead said of this new strategy: ‘If you don’t go in hard to the tackle you are never going to come out well. You’ve got to go in hard and low.’

It is an analogy drawn from rugby, a game which Boris played with enthusiasm at school and university.

When the time comes to ‘go in hard and low’ against Cameron, Boris will undoubtedly do so.
