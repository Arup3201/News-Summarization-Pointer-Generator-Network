In a family that definitely lucked-out in the beauty genes department, one generation has followed the next as Georgia May Jagger’s first advert promoting Thierry Mugler’s iconic fragrance Angel was released today – 19 years after her mother Jerry Hall was the face of the scent.

Revealing the images for the advert on her Instagram, the young model said: ‘So honoured to be the new face of Angel fragrance by #ThierryMugler 19 years after my mother’.

Jerry, then aged 38, was the face for the perfume back in 1995 to 1997, in a particularly sultry advert which saw the leggy blonde reclining on a moonlit sand dune.

Following in not only her mother’s footsteps, but also those of Eva Mendes and Naomi Watts, the campaign shows 22-year Jagger, known for her Rimmel ads and gap-toothed smile, in an edgier campaign, with the tagline ‘Beware of angels’

'It was a very creative ad. At one point, I was painted blue and covered in sparkles,'she told Vogue.

'It was incredible to go through the Mugler archives and see so many incredible dresses. It was quite inspiring to see it all."'

Jagger, who is one of the crowd of young models of the moment including Cara Delevingne and Jourdan Dunn, and has recently appeared in the Just Cavalli perfume campaign, said that being the face of Angel is a very special role for her.

‘My mother was a muse of Mugler and appeared regularly in his Paris runway shows. I have such wonderful memories of the fragrance and my mother's involvement with the Mugler brand.

‘It's very special to me to be following in my mother's footsteps.’

Hall and Jagger have always been very close, and previously enjoyed working together for Sunglasses Hut on a joint campaign for Mother’s Day this year and in 2013.

The mother-daughter dream team also launched Australian suncare range Invisible Zinc together in 2010.

Jagger is the youngest daughter of Hall and Rolling Stones' front man Sir Mick Jagger, who were married from 1990 to 1999.

The couple's oldest daughter Elizabeth Jagger has also made her mark on the modelling world, with campaigns for Lancome and Spanish clothing line Mango under her belt.

Introduced in 1992, Angel was Mugler’s first fragrance and has since risen to be one of the top 10 bestsellers in the world.

Jagger’s advert was shot by Norwegian photographer Sølve Sundsbø, whose portfolio includes shoots for Chanel and St Tropez.
