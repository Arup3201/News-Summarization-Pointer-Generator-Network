A YouTube video showing a man taking five steps up a flow of lava on Mount Etna in Sicily has been analysed by a geoscientist who has confirmed it IS possible to walk on lava.

Erik Klemetti, from Denis University in Ohio, has explained in his Eruptions Blog that when boiling hot lava hits the cool air, it forms a dark crust that can be stood on - albeit for a short period of time.

And although lava appears to flow like a stream, it is more viscous than water, which Klemetti claims means it can withstand a small amount of pressure.

The word lava can be used to describe molten rock expelled by a volcano during an eruption and the rock that solidifies and cools after an eruption.

When first erupted from a volcano, lava is a liquid and its temperature ranges from 700 to 1,200°C.

It is up to 100,000 times as viscous - thick and sticky - as water.

A 'lava flow' is when lava flows from a volcano and is created during a 'non-explosive effusive eruption.'

When it has stopped moving, lava solidifies to form igneous rock.

Explosive eruptions create a mixture of volcanic ash and other fragments called tephra, rather than lava flows.

During the 40-second clip, a man - described in the video's caption as a 'lava art craft worker' - is shown running up a small channel of flowing lava.

A colleague stands and watches from the sidelines.

As the walker's right foot takes his final step, a small flame is shown coming from the sole of his shoe.

Klemetti claims that the walker's foot probably 'combusted' from the heat of the flow. 

In his blog, Klemetti said: 'Taking a look at the video, the lava 
flow in question is moving pretty slow and has a dark crust on it.

'This 
means it is likely pretty cool.

'In fact, it looks like [the lava] is called "a'a lava", 
which is even more viscous than the pahoehoe many people associate with 
lava flows.

'Crust forms quickly on lava flows because there is a high 
temperature gradient between the lava (at ~1000°C) and the air (~25ºC), 
so the lava hardens into a semi-flexible crust.

During the 40-second YouTube clip, the man takes five or six steps up a flow of lava on Mount Etna. On his final step a flame appears under his right foot. Klemetti claims that this was the sole of the walker's shoe combusting from the heat of the flow

'Based on where the guys 
[in the video] are standing, the lava flow isn’t likely very large because the guy who 
doesn’t run up the flow doesn’t seem concerned to be standing only a few
 feet away.

'The flow itself looks confined to a small channel surrounded
 by solidified lava. My guess is that this little flow is fairly far 
from the vent (source).'

Klemetti continues that if a lava flow has a 'decent' crust, if it is moving slowly and if the walker moves fast enough, their weight isn't enough to make them sink into the flow.

Yet he warns that if the crust is uneven or thinner in certain parts the walker could end up falling into the lava.

There are two main types of lava - pahoehoe and a'a. Pahoehoe is Hawaiian for 'smooth, unbroken lava'. and is shown in the centre of this image. A'a is Hawaiian for 'stony rough lava'. It flows slower and cools quicker. This lava is shown on the right-hand side of the image and is the lava Klametti thinks is in the 'Lava run' video

In a previous blog post, Klametti explained that falling into lava would cause the water inside a human body to boil, turn to steam and the person would 'explode from within.'

Commenting further on the 'lava man' video, Klametti said: 'Apparently this video was taken by 'lava artists' during some recent activity at Mt. Etna.

Lava flows from Etna can travel far downslope in channels, forming thick crusts that could support a person - as they did here.

'Running up a lava flow is possible without much in the way of dire consequences if you (a) pick the right lava flow - cool and slow; (b) you step lively and (c) get lucky.

'This hobby is up there with base jumping from tall buildings and surfing a volcano in terms of smart ways to spend your time, but really, lava flows are some of the least dangerous of the hazards from a volcano.'
