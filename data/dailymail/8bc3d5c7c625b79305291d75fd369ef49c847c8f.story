When Tae Cho proposed to his girlfriend Lindsey Crouch on a Florida beach, he thought the moment would be lost forever.

But not only did a kindhearted stranger photograph the romantic proposal, she posted the pictures on Facebook in a bid to find the couple - and it worked.

Now the Knoxville duo have Heather Swanner's perfect shots, along with a handful of grainy smartphone camera images taken by family members.

'I got a call yesterday evening and my friend Marisha was like, you will never believe what I'm seeing on Facebook,' Cho, 28, told News 5.

His 23-year-old fiancee added: 'I looked at it and I was in shock and I started crying. I was in the middle of my friend's kitchen and I was like you guys look at this this is unbelievable. I was freaking out. I was so overjoyed. The shot was perfect.'

Kind gesture: Photographer Heather Swanner was at a photo shoot in Seaside, Florida when she secretly snapped this mystery couple getting engaged on the beach

Good deed: Heather Swanner recently posted to Facebook the photos she took of a couple (pictured) getting engaged in Florida in the hope she could find them and send them the pictures

Swanner, a professional snapper based in Alabama, was photographing a family on a beach in Seaside, Florida, several weeks ago when she spotted the proposal in action.

'It was such a quick two seconds that I snapped those pictures and turned right back around and started shooting my family,' Swanner told AL.com. 'I honestly didn't even think I had a good shot because I was so far away.'

Swanner said she noticed the couple's family hiding nearby with cameras.

Fearing she would get caught up in an imminent thunderstorm, Swanner left to finish her shoot without passing on her details to the couple.

But after sorting the proofs three days later, she decided to share the photos on her business' Facebook page to find the couple.

'When I saw them I realized they (the couple) really would probably want to have them,' Swanner told News 5.

The post was shared more than 300 times and, within a few hours, the couple she photographed got in touch with her.

'I
 post things all the time, but I think it takes something that tugs at 
people's heart strings to get them to share it,' Swanner said.

The couple, who plan to wed on September 27, said they were overwhelmed to see Swanner's pictures.

Crouch said she had seen Swanner taking the photos, but didn't have time to approach her.

'We saw 
Heather taking pictures, but in the excitement of everything we were 
unable to get her contact info,' Crouch said.

'When we realized we 
didn't get any good pictures we were bummed, but at that point there is 
not much you can do.'

She said family members, including her mother, were too far away to capture anything but a few 
distant shots.

'It still is crazy to me that a photographer in Birmingham who happened to capture my engagement put a post online,' Crouch said.

'And somehow through social media and the excitement people had in finding the mystery couple, we were found.'

Swanner gave the couple the photos as a wedding gift.
