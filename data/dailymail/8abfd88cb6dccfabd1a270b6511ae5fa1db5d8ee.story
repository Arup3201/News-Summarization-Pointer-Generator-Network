A convicted murderer has avoided deportation from Britain by claiming it would breach his right to a family life.

Cesar Castillo Torres fathered four children after fleeing to the UK from Honduras when he was accused of killing the nephew of the country’s former president.

He was found guilty in his absence and moves to deport him began when he was traced to the North East of England.

But the 38-year-old has won his appeal to stay on the grounds that it would be against his human rights to kick him out.

Last night the family of victim Gabriel Gaborit condemned the decision.

Mr Gaborit’s brother Gustavo, 34, said: ‘I’m horrified to discover Torres is a free man and cannot be deported to face justice. He is a very bad man,  a convicted murderer, and  he should be in prison serving his sentence.

‘I understand that people have human rights, but justice must come first. Torres is an extremely dangerous man and the idea that the British Government cannot deport him is unbelievable.

‘He should be locked up, not enjoying his life in the UK. Our family have been devastated by the murder. We are not bitter people seeking revenge, but we do ask for justice to be done.’

Honduran police say Torres shot 23-year-old Mr Gaborit in October 1996. He was arrested two years later but escaped custody by dressing as a female nurse during a visit to hospital and fled the country.

In 2002 he was tried in his absence and acquitted, but in 2004 prosecutors challenged the acquittal.

Honduran authorities insist father-of-six Torres was then convicted of murder in a retrial and sentenced in his absence  to 18 years.

In a further twist, Torres was said to have launched an appeal against conviction but, although the court’s 2006 ruling is unknown, this week the police officer in charge of the investigation told The Mail on Sunday that Torres remained a convicted murderer.

It is understood the killer arrived in England in 1998 and moved around to avoid detection, living in London, Luton, Hull and Newcastle.

His wife Indra and their eldest two children also came here and the couple have since had four more children.

Interpol issued a Red Notice requesting his capture and in 2009 he was traced to the North East, where he was arrested.

Two weeks after his arrest Torres claimed asylum, but the Home Office rejected his case and tried to deport him.

The killer, however, appealed the decision and an immigration judge decided he was entitled to remain here under Article 8 of the Human Rights Act, which states he has a right to a family life.

This decision was then appealed – unsuccessfully – by the Home Office at the Upper Tribunal Immigration and Asylum Chamber.

Torres’s victim was the nephew by marriage of Rafael Leonardo Callejas, Honduran president from 1990 to 1994.

Mr Gaborit’s family said he was shot 11 times – eight times with a .38 revolver and three times with a shotgun.

They claimed Torres had a professional relationship with the victim and the murder motive was financial.

Police said they found the handgun in Torres’s car and several witnesses placed him  at the scene. Although Torres is the only person convicted of the murder, detectives believe there was more than one killer.

Agent Gladys Borden, of the Honduran Police’s Investigation Unit, said: ‘This was a particularly brutal murder. Torres should be here in Honduras serving his sentence. He should not be a free man.’

Torres now lives with his  family in the top-floor flat of a converted terrace house in Newcastle’s West End. Dressed in loose-fitting tracksuit bottoms and a black hooded top, he said: ‘I like it here in England. It is a good country and I have even got used to the weather.’

When asked if he had fled Honduras after committing murder, he said: ‘No, that is a lie. I left because the police in Honduras kept shooting at me.

‘I will talk to you about all of this but I have to talk to my solicitor to make sure it’s OK to do so first.

‘I would love to give my side of the story, please contact my solicitor because I’m not sure what I will say or not.’

Charlie Elphicke, Conservative MP for Dover and Deal, who has tabled a Bill to replace the Human Rights Act with a British Bill of Rights, said: ‘It’s obvious that he should be sent back to Honduras on the next available plane. The fact that he has created a family in the UK while on the run should not be an excuse to avoid justice.’

The UK Border Agency said: ‘We are extremely disappointed with the court’s decision. We do not believe this individual needs or deserves refuge in this country. We are lodging a challenge against the decision and it would therefore be inappropriate to comment any further.’

The Mail on Sunday was unable to reach Torres’s immigration solicitor.
