Eighteen dogs and two cats were rescued from a filthy Pacific Grove, California home on Wednesday.

Animal rescuers from the SPCA for Monterey County had to force open the doors of the home because they were blocked by ' deep piles of feces and garbage,' reports KTVU.

Upon entering the home, rescuers' eyes began to burn from the smell of ammonia and toxins from urine.Â

The toxic smells from animal waste was so potent that the Pacific Grove Fire Department urged rescuers not to enter the home without protective gear.

The pets, four of whom were puppies, are recovering from flea infestations, eye discharge and trauma, ear infections, hair loss and dental disease.

Two of the dogs were pregnant and the other pets are not spayed or neutered.

Beth Brookhauser with the SPCA told KTVU that it would be a few weeks before the sick animals would be up for adoption.

'Right now the animals are being nursed back to health, giving them lots of love and compassionate care,' she said.

The home which is considered a historic home by the Heritage Society of Pacific Grove, is declared uninhabitable.

SFGate reports that SPCA officers are most likely going to submit the case to the Monetrey County District Attorney for possible animal neglect charges against the owners.

The homeowner's identity has not been made public.
