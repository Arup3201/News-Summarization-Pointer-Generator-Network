With just over a week to go, one of the most highly-anticipated all-British fights draws closer and the physcological battle which fans love to see hotted up when Nathan Cleverly and Tony Bellew were pitted together on The Gloves Are Off this week. Many feel that Bellew is spiralling out of control and worry if he can hold together, not just on fight night but on fight week.

I know how much this fight means to him; it's a fight he's asked me for ever since he joined our team. You do have to be careful in this sport not to burn your nervous energy in camp and at the big media events so that you can give it all on the night. Nathan on the other hand is as cool as a cucumber, locked away with his trainer Darren Wilson. He's calm and ready for the strenuous media activities and the fight itself.

Bellew has made no secret of his dislike for Cleverly in the build up to the fight 

Everyone's got an opinion but the fact is, no-one really knows who is going to win and that's what makes this fight so intriguing. Many feel that Tony has moulded into the better, stronger cruiserweight. Can Nathan hold up to his shots like he did that night when he defended his WBO light-heavyweight title? Can his work rate and technical ability overcome Tony in a fight which is now surely about pride and ego than precision and technique?

Promoting both fighters is a difficult situation for me; I'm very fond of both of them. All I can do as a promoter is give them the best opportunities and when they meet on November 22, it's just a case of may the best man win. It would be tough for me to give an opinion on who I believe will be victorious. The honest truth is, I just don’t know and I'll sit there just as intrigued and excited as you when the opening bell sounds at the Echo Arena.

Bellew and Cleverly almost came to blows when they fought on the same bill earlier this year

I've been involved in some big grudge matches over the last couple of years but I've never seen a hatred so deep from a fighter than that of Tony towards Nathan. He has spent many nights with Nathan on his mind, not just in this camp but after the first defeat.

I also don’t think I've ever seen a fighter want victory as much as Tony does whereas the dislike from Nathan towards Tony is not as intense, it's more about the will to win and ending the noise and this chapter of his career.

Cleverly is keeping cool and is determined to win for the second time against Bellew

While this is an official eliminator for the WBO cruiserweight world title, its about so much more than that. I'm not sure how Tony would handle a defeat, bearing in mind his emotional intensity going into the fight.

I've had plenty of tweets warning me to be on my toes at the weigh-in and press conference next week. The fact is, this is two men about to walk into an arena of 10,000 people wanting to see a war. Lets be honest, it's not normal; these are not normal people. 

These are special people in a special sport. But we have to remember we have a code of conduct to follow. Both fighters are role models to the younger generation. There will be of course be drama and intensity next week but both fighters, despite the rivalry, are real professionals and will remain a credit to the sport.

Cleverly and Bellew almost came to blows back in 2011 ahead of their first fight

Cleverly beat Bellew in their first fight back in 2011 and seemed to show respect to each other afterwards - but the relationship has got worse in the years since

The undercard has grown into one of the strongest I've ever seen. George Groves, James DeGale, Scott Quigg, Anthony Joshua, Jamie McDonnell and Callum Smith are all in major fights and with so much on the line, it's going to special night for British boxing.

I wish we had 30,000 tickets to sell because as it draws closer, this night gets bigger and bigger. It has all the feel of a British super fight.

We return to Dublin after many years and I cannot wait to feel the atmosphere insider the 3Arena on Saturday night. I think people overlook the challenge of Jorge Sebastian Heiland but this is a proper fight for Matthew Macklin and without doubt his career is on the line on Saturday. Sebastian comes as the WBC International champion and this fight is an official eliminator with the winner firmly fixed on a possible Miguel Cotto clash next spring.

Matthew will need to draw on all his experience and desire and all the energy of the 5,000-strong crowd to ensure he gets over the line. Heiland loves to come forward, throws plenty of punches and doesn't take a step back. We all know how Matthew likes to fight; expect a classic in Dublin.

At this stage of his career, when he's been in so many big fights, many will question his desire but Matthew is in great shape and desperate for another shot at a world title. Saturday will provide all the answers we need.

We've added a number of new destinations to our fight itinerary and Dublin is one that I'm very excited about. Especially the big grudge match between Spike O'Sullivan and Anthony Fitzgerald as well as the Irish debut of top amateur John Joe Nevin. Our very own Anthony Crolla, Kal Yafai and Sam Eggington are also in action. Expect a big announcement regarding one of those three early next week.

Kal is now well and truly back in the groove. He looked devastating on the Groves bill and has a tough assignment against former world title challenger Everth Briceno who will show us where Kal is at.

On the subject of all-British fights, surely a fight between Kal and Paul Butler is just around the corner?

I was absolutely delighted to welcome Bradley Saunders to the Matchroom team this week. He's made major waves in the last 12 months, moving swiftly to 10-0 with eight knockouts. The people in the North East are genuinely excited about Bradley and the thought of Matchroom staging major events in the region. He will box on the huge Liverpool bill on Saturday week and again in January before headlining his own show in Newcastle on April 4. To be honest, I cannot wait.

The North East has been a target of ours for a long time. Now we have the perfect excuse as Bradley joins what is, in my opinion, the best promotional stable ever assembled in world boxing.

Frank Warren this week lost his £2m claim against Ricky Burns. The Judge dismissed his claim as 'fanciful' and said that it bore “no relation to reality”. Ricky is owed £102,000 of his purse money from FW promotions (now in administration) and he will now pursue matter with the British Boxing Board of Control. The full judgement from Mr Justice Knowles can be found in the article HERE.
