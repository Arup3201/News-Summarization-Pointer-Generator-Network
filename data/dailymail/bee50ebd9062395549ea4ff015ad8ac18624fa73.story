Pulled: Chris Grayling said the video got the 'tone wrong', so the Ministry of Justice took it down

A Government minister has been accused of 'trying to censor' a video aimed at helping people to appeal when they have been stripped of their disability benefits.

Employment Minister Chris Grayling interfered with the content of an official film to make it more difficult for people to overturn decisions, Labour claimed today.

The video, which has since been removed, told viewers that if they appear at a hearing in person they are twice as likely to win, which Mr Grayling told officials made its 'tone wrong' and 'negative'.

The minister said it distracted from the issue that appeals will consider the facts of the case in front of them, not if someone has turned up.

It also said that the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) don't always send a representative to hearings.

'A couple of times it's noted that a claimant is twice as likely to win 
their appeal if they turn up in person – again this is broadly true, but
doesn't help to reduce the opinion that it isn't the facts of the case 
that are important, but the turning up in front of a tribunal and 
pleading their case,' an email from Mr Grayling to the Ministry of Justice said.

After this e-mail was sent the video, presented by appeals doctor Jane Parry, was taken down so its content could be considered.

It was also removed from YouTube for copyright reasons.

'I think for the moment we should wait to see what comments they [MoJ staff] come back with. It may be that we feel the whole tone of the video is wrong and could not be fixed,' an email from the Minister's account later said.

Timms told the Guardian today the emails a showed Mr Grayling is 'ignoring the needs of disabled people.'

'Many people are finding they have to appeal against wrong decisions on their disability benefits,' he said.

'With cuts to legal aid, it will be harder in future for them to get help. Now DWP ministers are stopping people even from seeing a video that might help them, produced by the Ministry of Justice.'

Complaint: The minister said the video detracted from telling people to concentrate on the facts of their case

Down: The video was removed for copyright reasons and its content is still being reviewed by the MoJ

The Department for Work and Pensions told MailOnline Mr Grayling never asked for the video to be pulled.

'At no point did the Department ask for the video to be taken down,' a spokesman for the DWP said.

'We raised some concerns about factual
inaccuracies in the video, MOJ officials agreed with our concerns and 
sought to revise the content.' 

This week it was revealed that thousands of people have been on sickness benefits for a decade or longer because they suffer from conditions including acne, bad backs and persistent coughs.

Official figures show that 885,100 have been signed off as being too sick to work and given incapacity benefit for ten years or more.

They have a bewildering array of conditions. Nearly 70,000 have been signed off due to bad backs while a further 140,000 have been away from the work place because of ‘depressive episodes’. Ten people have been on incapacity benefit for a decade or more because of acne, while 670 have been signed off because they are obese.

'Reform of the broken incapacity benefit system is about saving lives, rather than writing people off to a life on benefits as used to happen,' Mr Grayling said.

‘The reassessment of 1.5 million people on incapacity benefit and the work capability assessment we use means we can take account of conditions that change over time. If you can work you will get all the help and support you need to do so.’

He added: ‘These figures show the scale of the problem and the ludicrous situation that used to exist and why we are right to reform the system.’
