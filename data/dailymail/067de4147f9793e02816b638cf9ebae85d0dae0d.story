Two experienced airline pilots were sacked after having a furious row on board a plane when they encountered turbulence.

Captain Stephen Bird had referred to senior first officer Stephen Akers as his ‘bitch’ before their jet took off from Exeter to Spain, a tribunal heard.

When they later flew into turbulence, Captain Bird ignored Mr Akers’s request to avoid dark clouds and the argument began, the hearing in Exeter was told yesterday.

Mr Akers allegedly called Captain Bird a ‘control freak’ and told him to ‘**** off’.

An investigation by their airline, Flybe, resulted in the sacking of both men, who are in their 50s and now representing themselves in an unfair dismissal case.

Captain Bird, of Northam, Devon, told the tribunal that banter was common between Flybe pilots, many of whom are ex-military.

Tension between the two men started when Mr Akers, of Exeter, asked the captain if the flight log – recording fuel, weather and destination details – had been finished. Captain Bird replied he had not done it ‘because you’re my bitch’.

The captain said the comment was ‘clearly jovial’ and he did not realise former RAF squadron leader Mr Akers ‘found it offensive’, but he later apologised.When the flight encountered turbulence, Mr Akers urged Captain Bird to avoid dark clouds for safety reasons.

Flybe found there had been a 'massive breakdown' between the pilots that could have put passenger safety at risk

But the tribunal heard that the captain decided to go through them because the flight, last May, was already running 25 minutes late.

Mr Akers was said to have become very ‘agitated’ and the captain later said: ‘Sorry, that was worse than I expected.’

The hearing was told Mr Akers wanted to pursue the conversation, but Captain Bird told him to ‘fly the plane’, adding he would be happy to discuss it once they had landed in Malaga.

The captain said Mr Akers then called him a ‘control freak’ and he replied: ‘Wow, now I can see why you have had issues with other captains.’

Captain Bird added that if the co-pilot continued to argue with him he would have no choice but to report the incident to the company, to which Mr Akers allegedly replied: ‘**** off.’

The row lasted several minutes but the plane landed safely.

Mr Akers ‘stormed off the flight deck’ in Malaga, almost hitting the head of a senior member of the cabin crew with the flight deck door, the tribunal was told.

The return flight took place in ‘virtual silence’ with Mr Akers reading a newspaper.

Mr Akers told the tribunal that former Royal Marine Captain Bird never supported him and he was ‘patronised and humiliated’.

He added that he was concerned about the weather on the flight because two weeks earlier his plane had been struck by lightning.

The Captain, who has ten years command experience, said he was aware of Mr Akers' temper but did not feel the plane should be grounded for the return flight because of a 'relatively minor altercation'.

The return flight was in 'virtual silence' with Mr Akers reading a newspaper and they landed after a 'perfectly safe and uneventful' trip.

Once on the ground Captain Bird said 
he always shakes the hand of his First Officer, but Mr Akers told him: 
'You owe me a f***ing apology.'

The pair were on a flight from Exeter (pictured) to Malaga when the argument broke out

The
skipper said: 'I was shocked by his reaction. Stephen Akers called me a
liar and made several offensive remarks about me personally. He stormed
off leaving me to complete the shutdown and secure the aircraft.'

Both pilots phoned their manager, Captain Stan Wood, about the incident and he told them to file an Air Safety Report. They were both sacked.

Since his sacking, Captain Bird has not found any work despite applying to be an estate agent and work at a tile factory. Despite his flying skills, he said his future may be as a handyman.

He said Captain Bird had told him: 'I am the Captain, just fly the plane.'

The black box cockpit voice recorder was not used in evidence because the row on the way to Spain would have been wiped by the flight on the way back to Devon.

Captain Bird has 1,100 hours flying time and Stephen Akers 2,000 hours, the tribunal was told.

Captain Bird had been on sick leave for seven months and on anti-depressants after a messy divorce, said Mr Akers.

Captain Wood, who led the investigation, said any breakdown in crew relationships caused a 'potential risk to safety' of the passengers, crew and plane.

He said there had been a 'massive breakdown' between the pilots and his inquiry concluded that both pilots had been 'yelling at each other'.

Captain Bird and Mr Akers said they had clean disciplinary records.The hearing continues.
