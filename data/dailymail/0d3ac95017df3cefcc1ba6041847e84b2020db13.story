With the expansion of the European Championships from 16 to 24 teams for 2016, there has never been a better opportunity for all four of the Home Nations to qualify for a big tournament.

And after the fifth round of qualifiers this weekend, all have a strong chance of making it to France next summer.

At the half-way point in the qualification campaign, we look at the story so far and assess the chances of each making it.

WALES

The story so far

Wales have enjoyed an excellent start to their campaign, with three wins and two draws putting them top of Group B. 

The reformatting of the competition means that the top two from each group advance automatically to France 2016, while the third-placed side enter the play-offs.

Wales started sluggishly, requiring a late Gareth Bale free-kick to spare them from embarrassment against minnows Andorra, before earning a credible goalless draw at home to Bosnia-Herzegovina, who played at the World Cup in Brazil. 

Goals from David Cotterill and Hal Robson-Kanu saw off Cyprus before a 0-0 draw away to Belgium, on paper the strongest team in the group. 

On Saturday, they went top following a 3-0 win against 10-man Israel. Arsenal's Aaron Ramsey put them ahead on the stroke of half-time before the sending off, and two Bale strikes made absolutely sure after the break.

Results: Andorra 1 Wales 2; Wales 0 Bosnia 0; Wales 2 Cyprus 1; Belgium 0 Wales 0; Israel 0 Wales 3

Wales are currently two points ahead of Israel in Group B though they have played one game more

When did they last reach a major tournament?

You have to go all the way back to 1958, when Wales reached the World Cup in Sweden, to find their one and only finals appearance. They came close to reaching Euro 2004, but lost to Russia in a play-off.

What's still to come?

Much now rests on their match with Belgium, who are currently third, in Cardiff on June 12. If Chris Coleman's team can get something from that, they will be in a very strong position.

September sees a visit to Cyprus and a home return with Israel, before the campaign concludes with a tricky trip to Bosnia and a final home game with Andorra. 

From here, there really is little excuse not to make it but Wales have come close before, only to agonisingly miss out.

Fixtures: June 12 - Wales vs Belgium; September 3 - Cyprus vs Wales; September 6 - Wales vs Israel; October 10 - Bosnia-Herzegovina vs Wales; October 13 - Wales vs Andorra

SCOTLAND

The story so far

It was a case of hardest match first for the Scots, who mounted some stiff resistance away to World champions Germany and even drew level through Ikechi Anya before succumbing 2-1. 

A nervy 1-0 win over Georgia at Hampden Park followed before a fine performance earned a 2-2 draw in Poland. Scotland actually led in Warsaw after goals from Shaun Maloney and Steven Naismith but were pegged back. 

But two wins from two home games - 1-0 against the Republic of Ireland and 6-1 against Gibraltar on Sunday - have left Gordon Strachan's side third, good enough for a play-off spot as it stands but just a point off the lead.

Results: Germany 2 Scotland 1; Scotland 1 Georgia 0; Poland 2 Scotland 2; Scotland 1 Republic of Ireland 0; Scotland 6 Gibraltar 1

Scotland are currently third in Group D - enough to secure a place in the play-offs as it stands

When did they last reach a major tournament?

In 1998, Scotland reached the World Cup finals in France so a return there is very much on the cards. They have twice made the European Championship finals previously, in 1992 and 1996.

What's still to come?

The next match, away to the Republic of Ireland in Dublin is absolutely key. If they win, they will establish a five-point gap over them. If they lose, Ireland will leapfrog them. 

Scotland have an advantage in that their remaining games against the strongest sides, Germany and Poland, come at home. 

They must take maximum points from their away trips to Georgia and Gibraltar. But in the most competitive group of the lot, they have every chance of making it.

Fixtures: June 13 - Republic of Ireland vs Scotland; September 4 - Georgia vs Scotland; September 7 - Scotland vs Germany; October 8 - Scotland vs Poland; October 11 - Gibraltar vs Scotland

NORTHERN IRELAND

The story so far

It's been an excellent campaign for Northern Ireland so far, with four wins out of five putting them second to Romania in Group F. 

Michael O'Neill's side have exceeded all expectations, starting off with a 2-1 win over Hungary in Budapest thanks to late goals from Niall McGinn and Kyle Lafferty. 

Goals from Gareth McAuley and Lafferty saw off the Faroe Islands at home, before Jamie Ward and Lafferty secured a 2-0 win in Greece three days later. Their only blip came in a 2-0 loss to Romania, but more Lafferty goals on Sunday against Finland saw them return to form.

Results: Hungary 1 Northern Ireland 2; Northern Ireland 2 Faroe Islands 0; Greece 0 Northern Ireland 2; Romania 2 Northern Ireland 0; Northern Ireland 2 Finland 0

When did they last reach a major tournament? 

Northern Ireland have never made a European Championship and the last of their three World Cups was back in 1986.

What's still to come?

The top two in the group, Northern Ireland and Romania meet next at Windsor Park. In September, it's the Faroe Islands away and Hungary at home. The campaign concludes with Greece in Belfast and a tip to play Finland in Helsinki.

Encouragingly for Northern Ireland, there is a gap of eight points between themselves and Finland in fourth, so there really is little excuse not to make it into the top three from here.

Fixtures: June 13 - Northern Ireland vs Romania; September 4 - Faroe Islands vs Northern Ireland; September 7 - Northern Ireland vs Hungary; October 8 - Northern Ireland vs Greece; October 11 - Finland vs Northern Ireland

ENGLAND

The story so far

A perfect five from five for Roy Hodgson's men, who are making qualification look like a breeze. They have a six-point lead over Slovenia in second and it would take a real calamity not to make it through from here. 

Two Danny Welbeck goals saw them to victory in Switzerland back in September and that was followed by a predictable crushing of San Marino. 

Wayne Rooney curled home a free-kick winner in a tough game in Estonia, before Slovenia were beaten 3-1 at Wembley, with Rooney and Welbeck (2) finding the net. 

Friday night's 4-0 win over Lithuania made this England's best start to a season ever, courtesy of goals from Rooney, Welbeck, Raheem Sterling and Harry Kane.

Results: Switzerland 0 England 2; England 5 San Marino 0; Estonia 0 England 1; England 3 Slovenia 1; England 4 Lithuania 0 

Danny Welbeck's two goals against Switzerland in Basle got England off to the perfect start

Danny Welbeck is the leading goalscorer in Euro 2016 qualifying with six in five games

England have made a perfect start to Group E, with five wins out of five

When did they last reach a major tournament? 

Regular qualifiers for both the World Cup and European Championships but normally falling well short of expectations.

What's still to come?

A victory away to Slovenia in Ljubljana in June should just about secure England's place in the finals and, failing that, away trips to minnows San Marino and Lithuania, plus home meetings with Switzerland and Estonia should do it. 

Hodgson's men should really be aiming for a perfect record of 10 wins from 10.

Fixtures: June 14 - Slovenia vs England; September 5 - San Marino vs England; September 8 - England vs Switzerland; October 9 - England vs Estonia; October 12 - Lithuania vs England
