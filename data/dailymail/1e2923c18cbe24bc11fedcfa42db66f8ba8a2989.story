Disgraced PC Darren Heath, 44, pictured with a woman who has nothing to do with the case, admitted using his position to take advantage of women 

A predatory PC admitted abusing his position to have sex with three vulnerable women he met on duty. 

Darren Heath, who worked as a family liaison officer for Gloucestershire Police, took advantage of his victims over an 11-year period.

The 'manipulative and calculating' 44-year-old also harassed a fourth women and repeatedly went to the home she shared with her partner.

Heath, who also worked in restorative justice, admitted five counts of misconduct in public office between July 2002 and February 2013 at Bristol Crown Court. 

He also denied two counts of rape, one of theft and two further charges of misconduct in the public office - accessing the police database and failing to report an alleged rape.

The remaining charges will lie on the court file after his not guilty pleas were accepted by the prosecution.

Gloucestershire Constabulary's Professional Standards Department began investigating Heath following a single complaint in 2012.

But concerned officers decided to look back through their database and identified a number of other potential victims. 

Senior Investigating Officer with the Anti-Corruption Unit, Detective Inspector Giulia Marogna, said: 'It then quickly became clear there were a number of ladies he may have offended against.

'Darren Heath would use his position as a police officer, whether it was during his time working in restorative justice or as a family liaison officer, to identify women he could offend against.

'These were often victims of crime who were already extremely vulnerable but who he wanted to take advantage of even further. 

'Our investigation has been lengthy because we have had to spend time regaining the confidence of women who had been badly let down by someone they should have been able to trust, precisely at a time when they needed him the most.

'Heath was manipulative and calculating while he was offending and that is one of the reasons he was able to carry on doing this over a number of years. 

Detective Inspector Marogna said the case will now be referred back to the Professional Standards Department to consider the action the force will next take.

She said the most disappointing thing was that Heath showed no remorse and made no comment throughout his interviews.  

'Those victims have shown incredible bravery by supporting this prosecution and I want to pay tribute to them for that,' the detective inspector added.

'It doesn't stop here though - I have absolutely no doubt there are more victims out there and I would appeal to them directly to come forward.'

She added that it was 'very satisfying' that justice had finally caught up with Heath. 

Heath, who appeared in court in blue jeans, green jacket and blue v-neck sweater, visibly shook as he stood in the dock for the brief hearing.

The defendant, of Taynton, Gloucestershire, was released on bail to return to the court for sentence next week.
