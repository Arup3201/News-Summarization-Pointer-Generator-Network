Those at Old Trafford may not have got the memo, but the defence proved high on the must-fix agenda of Premier League clubs during the summer.

Manchester United's defensive unrest was eased by the late arrival of Daley Blind, but Louis van Gaal preferred to invest in firepower up front and he will hope that will compensate for his back problems.

Sixty defenders were bought by Premier League sides, compared with 30 strikers and here, Sportsmail dissect the comings and goings in each and every position...

GOALKEEPERS

The goalkeeper that dominated the headlines was Chelsea's Thibaut Courtois, who returned from three years away and must feel like a new signing, fresh from winning Atletico Madrid's first La Liga title in 18 years.

Now he's back, the 6ft 6in Belgian has usurped Petr Cech as No 1 at Stamford Bridge, the first keeper to do so in 10 years.

The most expensive purchase was made by Southampton who, for a cool £10million, lured Fraser Forster from Celtic. Manchester United's summer transfer activity got going with 17-year-old Serbia Under 19 keeper Vanja Milinkovic, too, although he is on loan at Serbian club Vojvodina.

DEFENDERS

Luke Shaw made headlines for the right and wrong reasons during the summer transfer window.

Firstly, for his £31.5m switch from Southampton to Manchester United. Secondly, for having his fitness publicly criticised by new manager Van Gaal.

Manchester City's Eliaquim Managala, at £32m, cost half a million more than his English counterpart. 

It is Arsenal's Calum Chambers, though, who seems a bargain so far for £10m from Southampton.

MIDFIELDERS

The theme in midfield seemed to be players winding up at unexpected clubs.

Cesc Fabregas's return to England saw the man that made 212 Premier League appearances for Arsenal join London rivals Chelsea for £30m.

But those at Stamford Bridge may never get used to seeing Frank Lampard don a different shade of blue with Manchester City - the 36-year-old's six-month loan from New York City still sinking in.

And Alex Song's season-long loan with West Ham wasn't the most expected switch.

ATTACKING MIDFIELDERS AND WINGERS 

Angel di Maria left Real Madrid and joined Manchester United for a staggering £60m, which broke the British transfer record for the most-expensive signing in history. Quite the statement by Van Gaal.

Likewise, Arsenal wanted to bolster their attack and did so with Barcelona's Alexis Sanchez for £30m.

Hatem Ben Arfa, with the deadline looming, was calling for help all the way from Newcastle and Hull obliged. Steve Bruce threw the attacker a lifeline with a season-long loan and the 27-year-old couldn't stop smiling.

Impressive: Angel di Maria left Real Madrid and joined Manchester United for a British record-breaking £60m

STRIKERS

It's still early days but Diego Costa has seemingly brought Chelsea's striker curse to an end after signing for £32m, with four goals in three matches.

Radamel Falcao's £6m season-long loan to Manchester United was as unexpected as it was impressive, and the former Monaco centre forward will soon get his first taste of Premier League action.

Arsenal secured the signature of United's Danny Welbeck for £16m in the early hours of Tuesday morning with the transfer window left slightly ajar.

More? West Brom broke their transfer record for £10m-signing Brown Ideye, Everton did the same with £28m-priced Romelu Lukaku, as did Hull with their £10m punt on Abel Hernandez.
