Burnley have made an £8million bid for Watford striker Troy Deeney.

The 26-year-old has been made captain for the new season but Watford will sell if they get a bid closer to £10m.

Interest: Burnley, Leicester, QPR and Aston Villa are all tracking Watford striker Troy Deeney

Leicester have also had a £7.5million bid rejected while QPR and Aston Villa are interested but are reluctant to meet the valuation.

Burnley have made Deeney their main target as they look to bolster their strikeforce with Sam Vokes injured.

Blow: Burnley want to boost their strikeforce after Sam Vokes suffered serious injury

Deeney scored 26 goals last season and Burnley boss Sean Dyche knows him from his own time at Watford.

Leicester have already signed Leonardo Ulloa from Brighton in a deal that could reach £10m and that has prompted Watford's valuation along with the fee Fulham paid for Leeds' Ross McCormack.
