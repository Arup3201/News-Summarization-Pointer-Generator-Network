Any move by our national game to bring back football in place of professional wrestling can expect the support of Sepp Blatter.

When FIFA’s president revealed exclusively to me in an interview screened at the SoccerEx convention in Manchester that he would be pioneering more new technology, we also discussed the plague of arm-grappling, head-locking, shirt-pulling and body slamming which is infecting and disfiguring the beautiful game.

Having disclosed his plans for following up goal-line technology with video challenges by managers and coaches against refereeing decisions, Blatter addressed the epidemic use of arms in challenges, saying: ‘This is the next issue we need to examine.’

Sportsmail has now launched a campaign entitled Hands Off In The Box, which highlights how this abuse of the laws and spirit of the game is at its ugliest from corners and free kicks. 

This penalty box incident caused controversy in Sunday's Manchester United vs Chelsea clash - on the left, Branislav Ivanovic wrestles with Chris Smalling while on the right, John Terry grapples Marcos Rojo

Proposals are being tabled for a summit meeting between leading referees and officials of the FA, the Premier and Football Leagues and the PFA.

Since the laws of the game already prohibit the use of hands and arms, all it will take is for a consensus to be reached. Then club managers can be advised how rules are to be applied more strictly.

No matter how draconian the implementation of the regulations, they can act confident of approval from the governing body of the world game.

In fact, they can set an example to be followed around the planet, all the way up to World Cups.

Blatter added: ‘The name of the game is football and that needs to be respected.’

Liverpool's Martin Skrtel has also been penalised in the past for penalty area blocking

Similarly, the proper art of defending needs to be revived.

Attacking the ball rather than the opponent, clever positioning and well-timed tackling without loss of balance are skills being substituted by primitive tactics more suited to the WWE.

There is a revealing sequence of photographs which show Bobby Moore relieving George Best of the ball with an intervention of such immaculate precision that England’s World Cup-winning captain kept his footing throughout.

If the most gifted of all British footballers – and one of the greatest of all time – could be dispossessed with such brilliant dexterity while in full flight, it should not be beyond today’s super-fit defenders to deny comparatively lesser forwards without dragging them bodily to the ground.

Cynically, the most blatant culprits are those who end to badger the referees to their faces whenever decisions go against them. That is another ill of which the game needs curing.

But one step at a time.

It is the wrestling which is spoiling our game as a spectacle.

So Hands Off In The Box - and all over the pitch for the matter.
