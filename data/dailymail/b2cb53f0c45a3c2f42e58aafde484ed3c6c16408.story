Life story: Joran van der Sloot was asked to detail his life by a psychologist after confessing to killing Peruvian student Stephany Flores in May 2010

The troubled life of a Dutch citizen jailed for 28 years for killing a Peruvian student in a fit of rage has been laid bare in a handwritten letter to police.

Joran van der Sloot pleaded guilty to killing Stephany Flores, 21, in Lima, Peru, in May 2010 after earlier meeting her in a casino.

He confessed to the 'cruel' murder, telling police he became enraged after she found out about his arrest and suspected involvement in the disappearance of U.S. teenager Natalee Holloway seven years ago.

Titled 'My Personal Story', van der Sloot, 24, was asked to write the document by forensic psychologist Silvia Roja Regalado as part of a handwriting examination after his arrest for the murder of Miss Flores.

Written on a crumpled piece of paper, he talks about his childhood in Aruba, his relationships and the death of his father in 2010.

Excerpts of the letter on RadarOnline said: '(I) always had a lot of friends and even girlfriends. When I was 14 I had my first serious relationship.

'When I was 17 I got arrested by the police on Aruba. They suspected me of the disappearance of an American girl.

'I was in jail for three months and then released. After this my dream of studying in the U.S. was impossible.

'My father died on the 14th of February 2010 and I returned to Aruba to be with my mother and help her with things.'

Van der Sloot ends his life story two weeks before Miss Flores was found beaten and strangled to death in a Lima hotel room.

He was sentenced to 28 years in jail by a Peruvian court on Friday and ordered to pay $75,000 in reparations to her family.

This is the letter written by van der Sloot which was handed to police. He was asked to write the text by a forensic psychologist

He can still appeal the conviction and
sentence, and under Peru's penal system he could become eligible for 
parole after serving half of his sentence - possibly in 2038.

His
lawyer had argued that he killed Miss Flores during a fit of rage he 
blamed on psychological trauma from being hounded as the prime suspect 
in the Holloway case.

The 
court heard van der Sloot killed the business student with 'ferocity' 
and 'cruelty', concealing the crime and then fleeing to Chile, where he 
was caught two days after her decaying body was found.

He
took more than $200 in cash and credit cards from the victim and made 
his initial getaway in her car, leaving it in a different part of Lima.

Sentence: Van der Sloot was jailed for 28 years and sent to the San Juan de Lurigancho prison in Lima, Peru

The prosecution had sought a 30-year sentence for first-degree murder and theft.

Miss Flores was killed five years to the day after Miss Holloway, an 18-year-old from the Birmingham suburb of Mountain Brook, disappeared on Aruba.

Natalee disappeared on May 30, 2005, during a high school graduation trip to the Caribbean island, where van der Sloot grew up. Her body was never found.

U.S. authorities are moving to extradite him to face charges over Miss Holloway's case.

Van der Sloot is accused in Alabama of extorting $25,000 from Beth Holloway to reveal the location of her daughter's body.

Prosecutors said the money was paid, but nothing was disclosed about the woman's whereabouts. Authorities claim he used the money to travel to Peru on May 14, 2010.

Investigators have long worked from the assumption that the young woman was dead in Aruba, where the case was classified as a homicide investigation.
