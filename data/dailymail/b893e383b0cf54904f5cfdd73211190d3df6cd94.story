A Florida woman tried to hide a stash of cocaine down a one-year-old baby girl's diaper during a police traffic stop.

Mercedes Williams, 24, was told by boyfriend Reginald Hadley, 28, of Sanford, to put a pill bottle with a gram of crack cocaine in her pants when he was pulled over for a window tint violation.

The worried woman, from DeLand, was sitting in the back seat of the 2015 Kia and decided to place the bottle into the diaper of the baby girl, but was caught in the act.

Mercedes Williams, 24, attempted to hide a bottle with crack cocaine in a one-year-old's diaper, but was seen by police. She was later found to have a small bag of heroin after being taken in by police

While Williams was later being searched at Volusia County Branch Jail, a small bag containing less than one gram of heroin 'fell from her bra area when she was taking it off,' according to police documents.

She was charged with child abuse, possession of cocaine, possession of heroin and introduction of contraband into a detention facility.

Police smelled marijuana during the stop off the interstate yesterday, and found one gram of the drug in the door handle behind the driver's seat.  

Hadley, a habitual traffic violator, was charged with driving on a suspended license as well as possession of crack cocaine and marijuana.

The driver was overheard telling Williams after they were stopped that he should have run from the vehicle. 

He was released after posting $2,500 bail, according to the Daytona Beach News-Journal.

Reginald Hadley, 28, told Williams to hide the cocaine in her pants and was arrested for driving on a suspended license as well as cocaine and marijuana charges

Police notified the Department of Children and Families about Williams's behavior and the baby was handed over to a family friend. 

Williams was held without bail. 

At least one other passenger was in the car, a 19-year-old woman in the front passenger's seat. 

The incident is the second time in a week where has been charged with abuse after a small child was in a drug environment.

An 11-month old baby pulled a baggie of cocaine out of his mother's shirt on Monday.
