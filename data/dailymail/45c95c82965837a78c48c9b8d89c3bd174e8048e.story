Involuntary hero: Triple graduate Benjamin Serra Bosch has become the poster boy for Spain's 'Lost generation' after his post about 'cleaning s***' in London

A Spanish graduate who won three degrees has found the only job available to him is cleaning the bathrooms in a London cafe.

Benjamin Serra Bosch, 25, received distinctions for his academic work in journalism and PR but has not be able to find qualified work in Spain or his new home country.

In a frustrated online rant, he outlines the hopeless situation for thousands of young Spaniards like himself who are forced to go abroad to take on jobs for which they are overqualified.

Mr Serra has gained thousands of followers and stirred online debate about unemployment and higher education in Spain after writing a post on Facebook and Twitter bemoaning his situation in London.

He has two Bachelor degrees, one in Journalism and Advertising and another in Public Relations from the prestigious private CEU Cardenal Herrera University.

He also has a Master's degree in Community Management from the IEBS Business School.

Yet he was not able to find employment in Spain, and after a six-month internship in London, he took a job at a ‘well-known coffee chain’ as a waiter.

‘I received a distinction for both my degrees and now I clean s*** in a foreign country,’ he writes.

‘I've been working in a well known café chain in London since May. And after five months working there, today for the first time I saw it clearly.

‘I clean toilets. My thought was “I received distinction in my two degrees and I clean other peoples s*** in a country that isn't my own.” Well, I also make coffees, wipe tables and wash up cups.’

The reaction from other young Spaniards, did not take long. Since Friday, his post has been 
shared over 1,500 times on Facebook alone, with thousands of comments 
from others in his situation.

Thousands have chimed in to complain of the hopeless situation for many young people in Spain, where unemployment for under-25s reached 56 per cent in August.

The Valencia native insists in his post that he is not ashamed of working a job he is overqualified for, but rather that, like many others of his generation, he was forced to go abroad to get it as a result of the high unemployment in Spain.

Online rant: Benjamin Serra Bosch's Facebook post on how, despite having three degrees he is forced to work in a cafe in London as he cannot find any employment in Spain

‘I'm not ashamed of what I do. Cleaning is a very worthy job, What embarrasses me is having to do it because no one has given me an opportunity in Spain. There are many Spaniards like me especially in London.

‘We are a plague. And make no mistake, the youth [from Spain] are not here to learn the language, having an adventure and new experiences. We are IMMIGRANTS.

‘I thought I deserved better after so much effort in my academic life. Apparently I was wrong.’

Following his post, Mr Serra has involuntarily been dubbed 'the voice' of his generation.

On his blog, Mr Serra clarifies: 'My intention has never been to go viral, and it became much less so as this madness is happening.

'Neither was it to get the reviews, but each one is free to think what they want.

As I said, I'm not ashamed clean . It is a worthy work. Similarly it is that of the server or any other. I simply complained that I'm not working for what I want and what I've made ​​.

'I know this has transpired because many of us [young Spaniards] find ourselves in the same situation or are parents who have struggled to prepare their children and identify with my situation. Or simply because there are people who see that Spain has spent years living in an untenable position.

'I am an ordinary person, not a public figure. I never wanted to be the hero of the stories, I just want to tell them.'
