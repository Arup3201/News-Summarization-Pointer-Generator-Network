A long-running dispute between neighbours over two inches of land boiled over in bizarre fashion when one was caught on camera ripping down a set of iron railings.

Ex-Lib Dem councillor Richard Oglethorpe was filmed pulling down the fencing put up by the elderly couple next door before smashing what was left with a hammer.

John and Susan Newton, who run an engineering business, said yesterday it was the culmination of a seven-year feud that began when they built a side entrance to improve access to their home.

This is the shocking moment former Lib Dem councillor Richard Oglethorpe was caught on camera as he took a hammer to the iron fencing put up by neighbours following a row with over just two inches of land

They said Mr Oglethorpe’s actions – which led to police being called – made them even more determined to stand their ground. The couple, who are replacing the fence, claimed the 53-year-old was a ‘bully’.

‘Once he got going with the railing there was just no stopping him,’ said Mrs Newton, 58. ‘He’s an absolute nightmare. He just bullies us and he’s even got a file on me with everything written down and photos.

‘We’ve had to do the same and that’s why we have CCTV cameras. But we won’t be moving. All I want is just to get on with my life.’

The dispute, on a quiet street in Aigburth, south Liverpool, escalated into a blazing row between Mr Oglethorpe and 81-year-old Mr Newton last Friday.

The former Liverpool council cabinet member for the environment was having his driveway resurfaced, and tempers flared over the fence, which he is understood to believe is fractionally on his property.

As his stunned neighbours stood by, the father of two pulled down the wrought-iron fence with his bare hands before smashing its foundations with a hammer. By the time police arrived, there was nothing but a tangled jumble of metal on Mr Oglethorpe’s drive.

Mrs Newton claimed her husband, who suffers from a heart condition, had been driven to despair.

But she vowed that the family would not be run out of the house where they have lived for 36 years.

‘He won’t speak to us and he just ignores letters from our architects and surveyors,’ she said. ‘If we are in the wrong then so be it, but I don’t want to go the court and pay a load of money just to show a legal document. I think he does, just so he can laugh at us.’

The couple say problems began in 2007 when they tried to build a pitched roof and then a side entrance to help Mr Newton get easier access to the house.

They claim Mr Oglethorpe halted the plan because the gutter would overhang his property by one inch.

They say he built an archway which encroached on to their land.

After the council refused to intervene they hit back by erecting the fence while he was on holiday in July.

‘I have tried everything to be neighbourly with him,’ Mrs Newton said. ‘But no one on the street likes him. They all think he’s a bully. My biggest fear is what he will do if we give him this piece of land.’

Mr Oglethorpe refused to comment. A Merseyside Police spokesman said: ‘After officers arrived and spoke to both parties, it became clear that it was a civil matter so officers offered advice at the scene. There is no more police involvement in the matter.’ 

The video shows while Mrs Newton was talking to workmen, the livid councillor used a hammer and brought the railing crashing to the ground - even though it had been in place between the houses since July
