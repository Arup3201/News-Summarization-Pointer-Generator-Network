This is the shocking moment a 'stupid' teenager wearing just a pair of shorts risked his life by jumping 50ft from a bridge into a canal to cool off.

The boy had managed to scramble up the curved arch of the Lowry footbridge at Salford Quays and was seen standing on the
top with two friends.

As his friends looked on, the bare-chested teen, who has not been named, then leaped into the waters of the Manchester Ship Canal. It is not known whether the two other teenagers on the
bridge also jumped.

'Plain stupidity': This teenager climbed to the top of the Lowry footbridge in Salford Quays before jumping into the Manchester Ship Canal below

The boy's plunge was filmed by a passer-by, close to the BBC's northern headquarters, yesterday as temperatures across Greater Manchester reached 23C.

This week is national Drowning Prevention Week, and although the canal is more than 25ft deep at the Quays the boy could easily have broken his neck.

'I’m astonished that young people would risk their lives in this way,' said Salford mayor Ian Stewart.

'Jumping off the side is dangerous enough but this is just plain stupidity.

'I’d urge all parents in Salford to warn their children that jumping into the Quays is not a harmless and fun prank. It could kill or damage someone for life.'

Fire service bosses called the stunt ‘truly shocking’.

'These reckless people are lucky they weren’t killed,' said Councillor Dave Acton, chairman of Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Authority.

'Water might look tempting on a hot summer’s day, but you have no idea what lies beneath the surface.

'The temperature of most open water is extremely cold. It can send your body into shock and kill you - even in hot weather.

'Our crews have pulled countless young people from canals and reservoirs. They all thought they could cool off in the water, for some of them it was the last thing they did.'

The footage emerged after teenagers in a separate incident at Salford Quays risked their lives by trying to untie a safety pontoon.

The group of three boys and thee girls were then spotted jumping on the raft attached to the edge of the water.

The Lowry Bridge, also known as the Lift Bridge or Millennium Bridge, was constructed in 2000 and is owned by the Peel Group.
