Speaking ahead of her AW13 collection show at London Fashion Week today, Vivienne Westwood called on the Duchess of 
Cambridge to stop buying so many clothes and make more
 of an effort to be green.

The style icon, who showed a 'quality over quantity' collection of structured, wearable pieces, knows a thing or two about the subject - and she's not shy of sharing her opinions.

Before her London Fashion Week 
showcase at the Saatchi Gallery today, Dame Vivienne said that because Kate
 goes to so much effort to get an outfit that looks good, she should 
wear it more often.

Eco warrior: 'You don't have to have a red outfit one day and something the same in blue the next'

The designer, who is an ardent environmental campaigner, has now voiced her disapproval of Kate's burgeoning wardrobe, arguing that repeatedly wearing the same pieces is better for the planet and would send a positive message.

She said: 'I don't have any advice for her, [although] I think it would be great if she wore the same clothes over
 and again, because that's very good for the environment and it would 
send out a very nice message.

'If you're going to all that trouble to get an outfit that suits you, then you should keep on wearing it.

'I mean you don't have to have a red outfit one day and then something almost the same in blue the next.'

This isn't the first time Dame Vivienne has complained about the Duchess of Cambridge's sartorial choices.

In 2011, she complained about the Duchess' use of eyeliner in the Sunday Times 
Magazine.

'I think she's got a problem with eye make-up,' the designer griped. 'The 
sharp line around her eyes make her look hard. Either she should be 
smudgy or wear none.'

Never
 one to shy away from controversy, Westwood was dressed in her usual wacky 
style with an image of Julian Assange on her t-shirt.

She said today's Red Label collection also carried the theme of quality over quantity, although that doesn't mean any less glamour.

'It's for anybody that wants to dress up [and be] wonderfully glamorous,' she revealed.

Dame Vivienne Westwood's show featured lots of striped wool blanket coats, mulberry and wine and lame, trademark draping on dresses and skirts, a mullet dress and an asymmetric cardi - and a wrap that looked like a bath towel.

The models' make up looked like it had been drawn on by a child but all in all the show, with Tyson Beckford and Meg Matthews in the front row, was pretty sane for Dame Westwood.

As she is clearly here to sell bags and perfume, in a show at the Saatchi gallery on the King's Road, the home of punk itself, clearly much has changed.

As Dame Vivienne targets the Duchess of Cambridge about wearing outfits more than once, Femail remembers the shoes she wore endlessly and the dress she shared with her mother...

'All
 I can say is it's quite a short collection this time because what I'm 
trying to aim for in my second line and all my offshoot products is to 
just keep aiming for quality all the time and have less quantity.

'I'm just trying to do a quality choice for people to wear something that really helps them to look good.

'That's what fashion is here for. It's here to help,' she said.

The
 show saw models move through various rooms in the contemporary art 
gallery and featured perhaps a more toned-down Westwood style.

Her trademark structured dresses were evident, along with gold boots, prints, metallics and velvet heels.

The
 models wore dramatic make-up with painted eyebrows and various colours 
of lip-liner on top of their white powdered faces - framed with 
glamorous curls.

The show was attended by Fashion Week regulars 
Peaches Geldof and Jodie Kidd, and after the show Kidd was full of 
praise for what Westwood had to offer.

She
 said: 'I thought it was brilliant and I just loved the combination of 
the colours, the tights, the clothes, the shoes, the bags, the 
tailoring.

'I just wanted 
absolutely every single piece, which is very rarefor me. I just loved 
this collection. I thought it was fabulous.'

The
 statuesque blonde said while it may have been less dramatic than the 
Westwood designs of previous years, the flair was still there and that 
it was important to remember the evolving nature of fashion.

She added: 'There were bits in there - you know like the sequinned pants.

'But, you know, when I used to do Vivienne it used to be boobs and great big dresses and things like that.

'But, you know, fashion moves, it evolves. Designers have to go with it and I think she's really nailed it.'

Before the show, Geldof said she was expecting it to be 'slightly mental', but said that is 'the charm of Westwood'.

She
 said of Westwood's style: 'It's really haphazard and sort of all over 
the place, which I think is what Vivienne's mindset is like, and I 
really like that the clothes are such a reflection of her and her 
personality, and it's really playful and fun.'

Other
 big shows taking place today in various locations across the capital 
include Mulberry, Temperley London and Matthew Williamson.
