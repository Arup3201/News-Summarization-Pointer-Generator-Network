David Jones boss Paul Zahra has quit the department store chain and will be replaced by Country Road head Ian Nairn.

The move comes just weeks after South African retailer Woolworths finalised its $2.2 billion takeover of David Jones, Australia's oldest department store, and took full ownership of the Country Road retail chain.

Woolworths said Mr Zahra, who has held the title of CEO at David Jones for the last four years, had resigned with immediate effect, but would stay on for three months to hand over to Mr Nairn.

The CEO of David Jones, Paul Zahra, has announced he will resign from his position only weeks after South African retailer Woolworths finalised its $2.2 billion takeover of the department store

'Mr Zahra has indicated that this would be the best time for a change of leadership in the company and having established a sound base for future growth, would like to move on to new challenges,' the company said in a statement on Tuesday.

He will be replaced within the next three months, by the current head of Country Road, Ian Nairn

It's not the first time Mr Zahra has announced his resignation however, with the CEO claiming he was stepping down for 'personal reasons' in October last year.

His departure was delayed when David Jones' chairman and two other board members resigned in February this year, forcing MR Zahra to stay on.

Mr Zahra took on the position of CEO from the former boss of David Jones, Mark McInnes, who resigned suddenly in 2010 after being accused of sexually harassing Kristy Fraser-Kirk, a David Jones publicist at the time.

Mr Nairn has three decades of experience in specialty fashion and department stores in Australia and overseas.

He had run Witchery before Country Road bought it in 2012.

Woolworths has appointed Witchery's current boss, Matt Keogh, as the new head of Country Road.

Woolworths head Ian Moir said Mr Zahra had provided David Jones with a strong platform for growth.

'The new management team will complement the existing skills and expertise at David Jones to create a strong, innovative and fashion-centric business,' he said.

David Jones is Australia's oldest department store, originally opening shop on George Street in Sydney in May of 1838

'David Jones is an iconic Australian business with great traditions and values and we look forward to taking it to the next level.'

Mr Zahra said David Jones' strong financial performance in the past year had helped create a natural exit point for him from Australia's oldest department store.

'It has been a privilege to be the steward of such an iconic Australian brand with an extraordinary team of people,' he said.

Woolworths took control of David Jones in July after shareholders accepted a $2.2 billion takeover offer.
