High street fashion chain Topman has apologised after it emerged that one of its jackets features an emblem worn by the SS, the notorious elite troops of Hitler's Nazi regime.

The £205 hooded jacket, part of the 'Horace' range, features the Odal rune, the emblem of ethnic Germans of the 7th SS Volunteer Mountain Division Prinz Eugen, which operated during the Second World War.

The division operated in the Nazi Germany-sponsored Independent State of Croatia and was infamous for its cruelty.

It committed massive atrocities in Niksic in Montenegro, where troops slaughtered, tortured, or burned to death men, women and children.

The Odal is also used by neo-Nazi organisations and other racial supremacist groups. It also appears on a pair of shorts with a similar design to the jacket.

The symbol was spotted by a shopper from Hove, East Sussex, who posted a review pointing out the insensitive mistake. It has now been withdrawn from sale.

He said: 'A friend of mine who wears punk-style clothing shared the link with me on Facebook. When I looked more closely I saw the Nazi insignia.

'When I checked to see if Topman had published my review I noticed they had withdrawn the jacket from sale.

'It’s a bit embarrassing for them,' he told the Sunday Mirror.

The jacket is made by an outside supplier and was only available online. A Topman spokesman said: 'The jacket was not designed by Topman. We apologise for any offence caused.'

Founded in 1925, the 'Schutzstaffel', German for 'protection squad', initially served as Adolf Hitler's personal bodyguards, later becoming one of the most powerful and feared organisations in all of Nazi Germany.

Heinrich Himmler, a militant anti-Semite who was later architect of the 'Final Solution', became head of the SS in 1929 and expanded the group's role and size.

Recruits had to prove their 'racial purity' and were also taught they were the not only the elite of Nazi Party but also of all humankind.

By the start of the Second World War the SS had more than 250,000 members and multiple subdivisions, engaged in activities ranging from intelligence operations to running Nazi concentration camps.

The soldiers of the SS committed many atrocities during the war, while the concentration camp system was set up in the 1930s by Theodor Eicke of the SS.

Thousands of SS men were also drafted to help exterminate the Jews of Eastern Europe, participating in mass killings or guarding ghetto districts where Jews from the west were concentrated before being sent to death camps.

At the end of the war many leading members of the SS - including Himmler - committed suicide.

Those that were captured were tried at the Nuremburg war crimes trials.
