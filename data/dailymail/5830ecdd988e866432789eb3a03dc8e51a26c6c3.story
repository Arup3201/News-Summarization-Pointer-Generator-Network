James Landale will stand in for Andrew Marr this Sunday after his stroke, the BBC has revealed

A BBC spokesman said the TV presenter was ‘conscious and eating’.

The first few days after a stroke can be critical, and there have been worries that his condition may fluctuate.

Yesterday sources close to the presenter confirmed there had been concern over his condition, but he was showing positive signs.

One said: ‘They weren’t merely keeping him in for observation. They were pretty damn worried about him.’

Colleagues were left stunned and concerned when the BBC issued a statement at around 7pm yesterday which revealed Marr's illness.

The corporation said: 'Andrew Marr was taken ill yesterday and taken to hospital. The hospital confirmed he has had a stroke.

'His doctors say he is responding to treatment. His family have asked for their privacy to be respected as he recovers.

'We will continue to broadcast The 
Andrew Marr Show and Radio 4's Start The Week with guest presenters in 
his absence. His colleagues and the whole BBC wish him a speedy 
recovery.'

It is understood that Marr's family are with him at the hospital. It is believed he has been conscious and talking, but there is still concern as the condition of stroke sufferers can fluctuate, particularly in the early stages.

An insider, who said there were 'a lot of shocked people at Broadcasting House', admitted it was too soon to say what the long-term implications would be for the broadcaster’s health and career.

The former BBC 
political editor, who lives in East Sheen, south-west London, interviewed the Prime Minister 
David Cameron at the weekend on his Sunday morning show on BBC1.

Labour
 leader Ed Miliband was also due to appear on The Andrew Marr Show this 
Sunday in his first big political interview of 2013. However, the BBC said that James Landale will stand in to present it.

Deputy PM and Lib Dem leader Nick 
Clegg was lined up to follow next week, as part of Marr's traditional round of 
New Year grillings with Westminster's big beasts.

The BBC today confirmed that Mr Marr will be out of
 action for the rest of the month, having lined up guest host Jeremy Vine to present the show on January 20 and Sophie Raworth on January 27.

He
 is known to be a fitness fanatic and takes regular exercise wherever he
 is filming. He is a keen runner and always abstains from alcohol during
 January.

The BBC's Acting Director-General Tim
 Davie said: 'I am very sorry to hear the news about Andrew. I wish him a
 speedy recovery and hope to see him back at the BBC soon.'

Labour leader Ed Miliband said on Twitter: 'My thoughts are with Andrew and his family. Hope he gets well soon.'

Marr's
 BBC colleague Andrew Neil tweeted: 'Very distressed to hear news about 
Andrew Marr. Best wishes for a full and speedy recovery.'

Also on Twitter, former Conservative MP Louise Mensch said: 'Joining in the chorus of well-wishers for Andrew #Marr. Hope he has a speedy and full recovery.'

A stroke occurs when the blood supply to part of the brain is cut off.

The brain needs oxygen and nutrients provided by blood to function properly, but if the supply is restricted or stopped, brain cells begin to die.

Speed of treatment is of the essence when dealing with a stroke, because the sooner a person receives help, the less damage is likely to happen.

Smoking, being overweight, lack of exercise and a poor diet are also risk factors for stroke.

Also, conditions that affect the circulation of the blood, such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, atrial fibrillation (an irregular heartbeat) and diabetes, increase the risk of having a stroke.

NHS Direct says the main symptoms of stroke can be remembered with the word FAST: Face-Arms-Speech-Time.

Face – the face may have dropped on one side, the person may not be able to smile or their mouth or eye may have dropped

Arms – the person with suspected stroke may not be able to lift one or both arms and keep them there because of arm weakness or numbness

Speech – their speech may be slurred or garbled, or the person may not be able to talk at all despite appearing to be awake

Time – it is time to dial 999 immediately if you see any of these signs or symptoms

He began his career in journalism on The Scotsman newspaper in 1981, later moving to London to become its political correspondent.

Marr was part of the team which launched The Independent in 1986 and returned as its editor, after a stint at The Economist magazine.

He was then a columnist for The Express and The Observer before making the move into television, as the BBC's Political Editor, in May 2000.

He has also presented a number of history programmes along with his politics show and has had five books published.

In May 2011 it emerged that he had taken out a super-injunction to prevent the reporting of an affair.

He won a High Court order in January 2008 to silence the press following his extra-marital affair with another national newspaper reporter.

He admitted he had taken the step as he said he felt 'uneasy' about it as a journalist.

The woman with whom he had the affair is a political journalist who has a daughter. Since their fling, some nine years ago, her name has appeared widely online.

Mr Marr is considered young to have suffered a stroke, as the vast majority of the 150,000 people who suffer the attack every year in England are over 65.

According to NHS figures, in England, strokes are a major health problem, and are the third largest cause of death, after heart disease and cancer.

The brain damage caused by strokes means that they are the largest cause of adult disability in the UK, but it also possible to make a full recovery.

Joe Korner, director of communications at the Stroke Association said: 'We are deeply saddened to hear about Andrew Marr's stroke and our thoughts are with him and his family at this hard time.

'One hundred and fifty thousand people have a stroke every year in the UK and around a quarter of these are in people of working age.

'A stroke happens in an instant but the effects can often last a lifetime. However with the right care and support it is possible to make a recovery and return to a life after stroke.'

* Former BBC director general Alasdair Milne has died at the age of 82 after a series of strokes. Milne led the Corporation between 1982 and 1987 before he was forced to resign after a series of rows with Margaret Thatcher’s government.

Acting director general Tim Davie yesterday said he was a 'charismatic editorial figure' behind some 'outstanding' programmes. Milne is survived by his daughter and two sons.
