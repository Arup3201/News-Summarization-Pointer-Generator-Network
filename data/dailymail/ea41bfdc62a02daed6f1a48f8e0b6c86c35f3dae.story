Dwyane Wade accepted a one-on-one challenge from a lovable opponent.

Illuminada Magtoto was turning 90 this year and she had one birthday wish.

The nonagenarian was a big fan of Wade and the Miami Heat fan and she recorded a video for YouTube challenging Wade to a little head-to-head basketball.

Throwdown: Grandma Nelly got her wish for a head-to-head challenge against Dwyane Wade, before the two played a few friendly minutes of ball

'Dwyane Wade, on my 90th birthday, I want to play one-on-one with you,' she challenged the Heat guard with a matriarchal wag of her finger.

She sealed the deal with a sneak preview of her skills, sinking a basket on her backyard court.

Wade took up the challenge on his own turf, and in spite being starstruck, Grandma Nelly drew some praise from Wade.  

'You throw better lobs that Mario Chalmers,' point guard for the Heat, Wade said after Magtoto sets him up for an alley-oop.

Though it's not clear who won the game, the two finished it with a hug.

Swagger: Grandma Nelly, for her 90th birthday, called out Dwyane Wade for a one-on-one competition to test out his skills

Court: The 90-year-old had no problem taking it to the hole and showed Wade what he'd be up against on her backyard court

Bucket: Wade gave his competition a leg up, taking her alley-oop and knocking in the basket in a competition that ended with a hug

Afterwards, Grandma Nelly and her family were treated to a Heat game against the Houston Rockets and palled around with Wade Sr.

Grandma Nelly had no bitter feelings about her rivalry with Wade after the contest. 

'I always pray for you,' she told Wade. 'Now, I feel like I'm very, very happy.'
