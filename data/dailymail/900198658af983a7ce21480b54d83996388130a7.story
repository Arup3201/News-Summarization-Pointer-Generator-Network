A mother has warned she could have been burying her one-year-old son after finding him playing with a gun he found in a rental car.

Jaymie Bates' son found the semi-automatic pistol in the centre console of the vehicle after the pair had driven home from the car rental firm Enterprise in Longview, Texas.

Astonishingly, this was not the only weapon found in one of the rented vehicles at the site - a police report has revealed one of the firm's managers told officers he had found another gun in a different car on the lot.

Danger: Little Matthew found the semi-automatic weapon in the rented car

Matthew's mother said she found her son with the gun after the pair got home in the rented car.

She told ABC affiliate KLTV that she stepped out of the car for a moment before getting back in only to find her son in the backseat playing with a 9MM semi-automatic pistol.

She immediately returned the car to the Enterprise where the manager filed a police report.

She said: 'The bottom line is my one-year-old was playing with a pistol.

'It could have gone off, anything, I could be burying my son.

'What is a mother to do or think?'

Enterprise has said the safety of its customers is its top priority.

It said when each vehicle is returned their procedure is to clean everything, check under seats, the glove compartment, the centre console and in door compartments.

The company's spokeswoman Lisa Martini said the company was investigating what went wrong.

She said the company will revisit with all of its service agents to make sure it doesn't happen again.

It is unclear whether the gun was loaded, but a police report has said a manager at the site found another gun in a vehicle, according to KTRE.

According to the police report, both guns were mistakenly left behind by the previous renters of the vehicles.
