Trial: Darren Ramsey, of east London, was allegedly linked to the crime with a one-in-a-billion DNA match

A party host raped a guest then claimed he must have been sleepwalking during the sex attack, a court heard today.

Darren Ramsey, 24, of Poplar, east London, was allegedly linked to the crime with a one-in-a-billion DNA match - but insisted he was unconscious and remembers nothing.

He forced himself on a 22-year-old woman who was asleep following a celebration at his one-bedroom flat, the Old Bailey was told.

Paul Jarvis, prosecuting, told the central London court: 'Mr Ramsey says he was asleep when he had sex with her and therefore his actions (were) all done when he was effectively unconscious.

'How is it he comes to that conclusion? It seems from the strength of the interviews, because he claims not to remember doing it - therefore he must have been asleep when he did it.'

He added: 'While he may deeply regret what he did he cannot escape the simple fact he did it.'

Mr Jarvis claimed that Ramsey, who had previously suffered from alcohol-related blackouts, had been able to remove clothing from himself and the woman before raping her.

The attack is alleged to have taken place in the early hours of April 14 last year after a party at Ramsey's home. The woman said she believed her drink had been spiked earlier in the evening when she left the living room to go to the toilet.

'Someone had put more Jack Danielâ€™s in it,' she said. 'It was a lot stronger.'

Later, she talked with Ramsey in his bedroom and the two went to sleep fully clothed. She allegedly then woke to find her leggings and underwear around her ankles and Ramsey forcing himself on her.

'I panicked,' she said. 'I was in shock. I just lay still and eventually went back to sleep.'

The woman said she told a friend about the attack the next morning on her BlackBerry. A taxi was called for her and she was eventually persuaded to go to the police by her mother a week later.

When he was arrested, Ramsey said the last thing he could remember was going to sleep with his arm around the alleged victim.

The court heard he told officers: 'That's what people do - they cuddle up when they're in bed.' Ramsey denies a single count of rape. The trial continues.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
