Marseille coach Marcelo Bielsa blasted the club's president Vincent Labrune for not consulting him during the transfer window.

The 59-year-old claimed he did not even know the club was signing Brazilian defender Doria until he arrived for his medical and revealed that none of his actual transfer targets had been acquired.

Bielsa, who has managed Argentina and Chile, has taken charge of Marseille in four matches since joining this summer.

Disaster: Marcelo Bielsa claimed none of his transfer targets were acquired despite promises from the club

Bielsa said he did not get the right players during last month's transfer window - with midfielder Benjamin Stambouli joining  Tottenham instead - and that he was not even interested in 19-year-old centre half Doria, who joined on deadline day Monday from Botafogo.

'The outcome of the transfer market is negative,' Biesla said. 'The president made promises that he knew he couldn't keep. 

'None of the players joined with my approval. I proposed 12 and none of them came. We wanted Stambouli or (Toby) Alderweireld.'

Bielsa wanted to keep Brazilian center half Lucas Mendes, who joined Qatari club El Jaish.

'I found out that we had sold Lucas Mendes at the last minute because he was leaving for Qatar. I found out about the Doria signing on Monday afternoon when he was arriving for his medical. I opposed it,' Bielsa said. 

'The president also promised me we wouldn't sign foreign players, because Marseille doesn't have enough of a structure in place to judge the qualities of someone who isn't playing in France.'

Bielsa added that 'the way the club is run disappoints me,' and tensions are likely to be high when training resumes following the international break.
