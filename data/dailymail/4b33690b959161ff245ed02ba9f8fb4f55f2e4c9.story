The daughter of serial killer Fred West branded actor Dominic West a 'hypocrite' after he claimed he felt 'sullied' and suffered nightmares while playing the murderer in a new TV drama.

Anne-Marie Davis, 47, criticised the cast, 
programme makers and police for their controversial roles in Appropriate Adult, a new ITV production about the murders of women and girls at 25 Cromwell Street, Gloucester.

She said: 'When an actor like 
Dominic West talks about being ''sullied'' by the role and talks of 
nightmares, you have to question their hypocrisy.

'What of the victims 
who survived and all the victims' families who have lived with this for 
more than two decades? He has had but a glimpse of their world.'

The mother-of-two slammed ITV for using the 'Fred and Rose brand' in a 'global money-making exercise'.

Mass murderer Fred West, 53, hanged himself in Winson Green Prison on New Year's Day 1995 as he awaited trial for 12 murders.

His wife Rose West, 57, is serving a 
full-life term in Low Newton Prison after she was found guilty of her 
part in ten murders including that of her 16-year-old daughter Heather at 
Winchester Crown Court in 1995. 

The ITV drama is seen through the eyes
of the 'appropriate adult' Janet Leach, who acted as an independent 
safeguard by sitting in on Fred West's police interviews.

Ms Davis was raped and tortured by the Wests when she was eight and her mother Rena Costello  and sisters Charmaine 
and Heather were murdered.

Anne-Marie condemned current 
Gloucestershire police chiefs for assisting ITV production staff, a decision which has concerned retired officers
who worked on the West case and pledged to look after the 
victims' families.

She said:'I believe that decision is 
pretty lame and the current regime should be ashamed of the position 
they have put the victims' families in, and ashamed that they have let 
down former colleagues whose morality was, and remains, so resolute.

'ITV
have used the police input to advertise the validity of their research.
It is questionable whether police resources should be spent helping a 
private enterprise that exploits the victims of crime for profit.'

Dominic West, who starred in The Wire and BBC drama The Hour, has previously said how he suffered 'pretty horrible dreams during the shoot where I'm perched on a wall and Fred West was trying to grab me and pull me down. 

'I was fairly determined not to let him get to me. I only did it for three weeks and it was a pretty intense, very dark three weeks. It was pretty grim.'

Ms Davis has been critical of the new, two-part drama throughout its making.

She said: 'I'm still unsure whether ITV and the actors comprehend the depth of our grief, but how could they? I just ask that they spare a thought for the victims and their families when they pick up their pay cheques.

'We live in an age of multiple TV channels, many of which regularly screen repeats. That means for the rest of our lives this programme will be re-run over and over.

'Whilst Dominic West moves on to his next role, another life sentence will start for all of the families.'

Ms Davis, who gave evidence against Rose West at her trial, has refused to watch the first 90-minute episode of Appropriate Adult when it is screened at the weekend.

She said: 'I find the whole idea of this production sickening, but I have tried to be balanced in my criticisms.

'I have enough emotional and mental baggage and I don't need an actor to haunt or further remind me of the crimes my father perpetrated.

'Many people think that it's my perception there will be re-enactments of murder and gratuitous violence and that is why I am so disturbed. It is not.

'My frustration stems from the resurrection of my father on screen, the re-enactments of dialogue between interviewing police officers and my father describing the circumstances surrounding my mother's and sisters' disappearances, their murders and his subsequent disposal of their bodies.

'No doubt, the same treatment will be given to the other victims and the effect this will have on their families must be considered.'

She added: 'I hadn't spoken publicly for ten years until this drama was mooted. I have never put myself forward as a spokesperson for the victims' families, and I never will.

'Maybe, as a member of the West family, I shouldn't have a view. All I can say is that I speak for my sanity.

'It is indicative of our society that we haven't moved on from the voyeurism that surrounds the ''Fred and Rose'' branding and I suggest that ITV wouldn't have invested so heavily in ''The Janet Leach Story'' without it.

'I congratulate them for finding their angle, riding high on the back of Mrs Leach. They have walked a tightrope, balancing the validity and compassion for Mrs Leach with the memory of the victims and their families' grief - and they have opted to fall on the side of Mrs Leach.

"I would ask people to put aside that voyeurism for just a few minutes and consider the victims of all such crime, their families and the life sentences they have to serve - without choice.'

Ms Davis, who was sexually abused by Fred and Rose West and other men they brought to 25 Cromwell Street, managed to flee the family home when she was 15 in just the clothes she was wearing.

She said: 'My mother Rena and my sisters Charmaine and Heather, are my heroes. I was an eight-year-old coward and I was still a coward when I ran away.

'But my mother and siblings stood up to them and paid the ultimate price. To have an actor pretending to be my father and describing how he murdered and disposed of their bodies I find an insult to their memories because they were real people, not just a name on a page, who deserve a little more respect.'

The mother of two described the lasting effect that the horrific experiences had on her own life.

'There was no doubting the overwhelming sense of emptiness and loss. Justice had been served and now it was time to try and pack away the memories of past and present, except it was not that easy.

'There was little support available locally and the NHS just didn't know what to do with me and I am ashamed to admit that I attempted to take my own life on a number of occasions and I am lucky to be alive.

'It would take years before I got the kind of counselling and professional support that I desperately needed.'
