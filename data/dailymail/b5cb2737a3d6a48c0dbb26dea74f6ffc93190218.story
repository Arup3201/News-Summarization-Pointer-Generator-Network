Horsemeat found in beef burgers manufactured for British supermarkets was imported from Poland, it emerged last night.

Tests have revealed that ‘raw material’ supplied to an Irish processing plant, which made burgers for Tesco, Aldi, Lidl and Iceland, contained as much as 20 per cent horse DNA, the Irish Government said.

Around 10million beef burgers have been withdrawn from sale by supermarkets, and other smaller retailers in the UK, since the scandal, which centred around the Silvercrest factory, in County Monaghan, broke earlier this month.

Closing in: The source is now thought to be an unnamed factory belonging to ABP Food Group in Poznan, Poland

Customers and food standards experts were left reeling after tests by the Foods Safety Authority of Ireland revealed burgers supplied to Tesco – Britain’s biggest supermarket chain - contained 29.1 per cent horse DNA.

Burger King also stopped using Silvercrest’s products, although there was no horsemeat found in burgers sold by the fast food chain.

Simon Coveney, the Irish Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, said the latest tests were a ‘major breakthrough’ in their investigation to identify the source of the contaminated products.

He had initially suggested imported ingredients from Spain and the Netherlands were to blame, but yesterday revealed the ‘likely’ source was an unnamed factory in the eastern European country.

Mr Coveney said the raw material was made from ‘low value’ cuts of meat.

Scandal: Burgers supplied to Tesco and other major outlets contained up to 29.1 per cent horse DNA

‘It’s fat cuts, trims, de-sinewed meats,’ Mr Coveney said. ‘There was equine DNA, which is horsemeat, in the product.

‘There is no evidence to suggest that anyone knowingly imported product that had horse DNA in it, but clearly that is what happened.’

The minister said the ABP Food Group, which owns the plant, had now agreed to source meat only from the UK and Ireland and to introduce regular DNA testing of meat at Silvercrest and its sister factory, Dalepak Hambleton, north Yorkshire.

However, the firm, which denied the contaminated meat had come from the company’s plant in Poznan, Poland, refused to say whether it was permitted to use the Polish ingredient in Tesco’s burgers.

Food safety experts say horse DNA poses no health risks to consumers, but the discovery has raised concerns about the food supply chain and the ability to trace meat ingredients.

Tesco welcomed the Irish government's 
announcement, saying: 'The findings announced by the minister correlate 
with the results of our own investigations at the plant.'

But Burger King, which switched suppliers
 when news of the scandal first broke, said it would be seeking further 
reassurance that products for their beef patties were sourced in the 
British Isles.

'Despite these findings, we take this matter very seriously,' a spokesman said.

'We
 remain committed to identifying suppliers that can produce 100 per cent
 pure Irish and British beef products for us that meet our high quality 
standards.'
