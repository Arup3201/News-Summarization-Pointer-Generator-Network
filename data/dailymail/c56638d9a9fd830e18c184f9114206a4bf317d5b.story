Jurgen Klopp has tipped Liverpool to follow Borussia Dortmund's blueprint and emerge as one of the key forces in Europe this season.

While the enigmatic Klopp was relaxed about seeing his side beaten 4-0 by Liverpool on Sunday, he was quick to recognise that Brendan Rodgers' side have the potential to be a threat to all with their slick passing and speed on the counterattack.

He also sees parallels between Dortmund and the situation Liverpool have found themselves this summer: in the past 16 months, Klopp has seen his key players Mario Goetze and Robert Lewandowski cherry-picked by Bayern Munich, while Liverpool have lost Luis Suarez to Barcelona.

But Klopp still believes Liverpool showed enough in a performance that delighted Brendan Rodgers they can make a mark even without their talisman and feels they can be a 'big team' in the race for major honours.

When asked about Suarez's departure, Klopp said: 'It seems to be no problem! They have a plan maybe but I don't know. We can play better than that and Liverpool can play better too.

'Liverpool is a great club and they did well last year. I saw it. If you make the right decisions after you miss (a trophy) you can be stronger. Maybe Liverpool this year is the big team in the Premier League. We will see.

'We are only the middle of our preparations and on Wednesday we have the other match against Bayern Munich in the Super Cup. Our problem at the moment is not (missing) Lewandowski. The players all start at different moments and this was not the ideal time to face Liverpool.'

Rodgers described Klopp as 'an inspiration' in his programme notes and Dortmund's manager can see some of the way his side have developed in how Liverpool have progressed under the Northern Irishman.

'We did what we did, when we started we tried to create football moments that will hopefully be more successful than the past,' said Klopp. 'We didn't think about what happened in the past, just how we can develop the team. That's what we do at the time.

'He's a good manager but I don't think about things like this. He does his job and I do mine.'

Klopp, meanwhile, has confirmed there is no possibility of Mats Hummels – who has just been named Dortmund captain – joining Manchester United this summer.

'He is going nowhere,' said Klopp. 'He is staying with us.'
