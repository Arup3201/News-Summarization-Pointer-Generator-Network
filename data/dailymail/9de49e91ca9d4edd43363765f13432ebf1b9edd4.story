Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger has heaped praise on midfielder Santi Cazorla - claiming the Spaniard is in 'the best form of his career'.

Cazorla was exceptional during Arsenal's impressive 2-0 victory over champions Manchester City at the Etihad last weekend, scoring a penalty and controlling midfield.

But the 30-year-old former Malaga, Villarrael and Recreativo midfielder has not always enjoyed such an easy-going time in the middle of the Gunners' engine room.

Cazorla made the difference for Arsenal and his inspirational performance has drawn praise from Wenger 

Yet, since he has switched to a more central possession in recent weeks, he has thrived - prompting his manager's praise. 

Wenger said: 'He is very talented football player and since he plays central, he has taken on another dimension.

'On the flank he was a bit more exposed to things where he is not at his best.

'In the middle of the park he gets you out of situations when you are under pressure.

'Technically he is always perfect. In the recent games, he is in the best form of his career. He is happy to play anywhere.

'He is happy to be the ball every day and he is a perfect example of every young player to follow.'
