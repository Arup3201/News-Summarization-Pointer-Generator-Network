Staring at a scrawled picture of a bright orange pumpkin surrounded by purple and pink witches, Andrew is nearly moved to tears.

‘When he’s drawing I see my son going in and out of his crayon box like 50 times and now I see why,’ he says, his voice quiet with pride and his mouth turned up at the corners.

One of 300 million people worldwide, Andrew has colour blindness, meaning he has never been able to truly appreciate his son’s sketches.

The glasses can assist with colour blindness, a condition that affects 300 million people worldwide. Andrew is pictured avidly staring at a colourful display

He is trialling new glasses which correct the condition, allowing him to experience normal vision for the first time in his life.

Valspar, a US- based paints company, have released a video showing colour blind people using the glasses for the first time.

In the film, Andrew is later seen staring at a warm sunset. He laughs with joy, exclaiming ‘Is this what you guys see every day?’

EnChroma, who manufacture the glasses featured in the film, claim the spectacles allow wearers to ‘gain faster and more accurate discrimination of colours such as in traffic signals and signs’.

They can also ‘improve confidence with colour naming’, and increase the perception of detail and depth in coloured objects.

But best of all, EnChroma says the glasses give people who view the world in varying shades of grey the ‘profound experience of a bright and vivid world of colour’.

Robert Sprujit, a perceptual psychologist featured in the video, said: ‘Colour blindness is a situation where, because your eyes are different from someone else’s eyes you don’t see the world in the same way.

‘Commonly, red and green don’t look different, they look the same.

‘If there’s a colour filter, like glasses,  that can separate colours they suddenly can see red and green again.

Donald McPherson, co-founder of EnChroma, added: ‘There’s nothing wrong with the wiring.

‘The problem exists in the eye, with the photopigments. So Valspar is working with us at EnChroma to bring colour to everyone.

‘We developed these glasses to enable colour blind people to see colour for the first time in their lives’

Colour blindness, also known as colour vision deficiency, is where a person finds it difficult to distinguish between different colours.

For example, completely different colours like red and black might appear the same.

In most cases, colour blindness is inherited, but it can also develop as the result of a pre-existing health condition, or as a side effect of certain medicines.

It occurs due to an abnormality of the retina, the layer of cells at the back of the eye that are sensitive to light.

The cone cells in the retina are sensitive to different wavelengths of light.

For people with normal vision, the brain compares the signals from all three cones, enabling a person to see the colour of an object.

But for people who are colour blind, one or more cones will be missing or won't function normally, which means they will be unable to see the full spectrum of colours.

But for people who are colour blind, one or more cones will be missing or won't function normally, which means they will be unable to see the full spectrum of colours.

For example, one of the cones in the eye will absorb too much red light, creating a phenomenon called ‘spectral overlap’.

EnChroma says spectral overlap is analogous to how to radio stations played at the same time might bleed together.

The two streams of information conflict, and the more the signals overlap, the greater the extent of the colour blindness.

The glasses, which cost upwards from $349.95 (£235), work by correcting the overlap, separating the signals and providing better perception of colour.

However, EnChroma adds that the glasses are not a cure for color blindness – it is a product that can assist with it.

Kalon: I wanted to go into the military and trying to be a navy sail and that’s where I found out I was colour blind. It changed the direction I was going it, I stayed in the military but I wasn’t able to pursue being a navy seal. I’ve always wanted to see the colours of the flag, but to actually be able to see and distinguish the red clearly. Before, red looked like a brown to me. It’s hard to even put into words how to describe seeing it for the first time. That alone is priceless to me. The flag has a lot of importance for me.

Christopher: I found out when I was in elementary school, in third grade. The teacher had crayons out in school and she asked me to identify the crayons and I couldn’t and that was the first experience of realising I was colour blind. I looked at it as a curse. For me, it was a setback. You have goals, you have things you want to achieve and being colour blind holds you back. I wanted to join the marine forces, but because of my colour vision deficiency that’s not the door. I can’t work in special ops, I can’t work in combat. With the glasses it makes it a lot better. I’ve had the opportunity to see colour in a way I never have in my entire life, so for me that’s exciting.

Atlee: I think my colour blindness was discovered in kindergarten. I was drawing my flowers brown and my oceans black and skies were purple. I was officially diagnosed. I think its 0.5 per cent that a girl is actually colour blind. When I used the glasses I thought ‘Is this what it really looks like to you guys?’. For a second I felt sad, like I’d been missing out on how vibrant it all is. But then I thought how cool it is that I get the opportunity to see the world in a different way, and its special to me.

Keith: When I smell roses I think of my mother. When I was a little boy we had a rosebush in the back yard and it was yellow with red tips. And I still see it today and I think ‘it’s so beautiful’. But I think ‘what was I not seeing in that rose’. If I were to see that rose and there were other colours there I would think that was kind of poetic. On the first day of school she would take me to the back yard and she would cut me a rose to give to my teacher. What if saw that rose and I saw all these colours that I never saw before? I think it would be in a way like my mother was speaking again to me.
