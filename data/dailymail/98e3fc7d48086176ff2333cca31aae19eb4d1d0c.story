A woman is fighting to get the Facebook page of her sister's killer taken down after discovering he had uploaded a new profile picture while in jail.

Doris Reeves logged into Facebook last month to see pictures of her grandchildren, but was shocked to find that Joseph Kennedy had posted a new photograph in his prison uniform.

Kennedy is serving a life sentence plus 40 years for the kidnap and murder of her younger sister, Karen Yarbrough, in 2001, after stabbing her 14 times.

Mrs Reeves said: 'It just makes me so angry something needs to be done. It would mean everything to me just to get it down.'

Investigation: Convicted murderer Joseph Kennedy has provoked outrage after posting this profile picture on his Facebook page showing him in his prison uniform while serving a life sentence

Furious: Doris Reeves logged into Facebook last month to see pictures of her grandchildren, but was shocked to find that Joseph Kennedy had posted a new photograph in his prison uniform

She has been trying to get the page removed for the last four weeks, but officials at the Arizona Department of Corrections (ADC) say they can't take action without his user and password.

An investigation has been launched to establish how Kennedy was able to access Facebook in side the unit in Pine Bluff, Arkansas, as inmates are banned from using mobile phones.

Shea Wilson told KARK: 'We are still investigating what happened in this case, it is obvious the inmate was able to get an electronic device and get on Facebook.'

Facebook said the ADC had not yet requested that Kennedy's page be taken down.

Victim: Kennedy is serving a life sentence plus 40 years for the kidnap and murder of Mrs Reeves's younger sister, Karen Yarbrough (pictured left), in 2001, after stabbing her 14 times

A spokesman said: 'If we receive a report from the department of corrections that an inmate is using Facebook in violation of local laws or the regulations of the prison facility, the page would be deactivated.'

Officers at the ADC confiscate around 300 mobile phones from prisoners each year.

If found guilty of having a mobile behind bars, Kennedy could lose good time and one year of phone use.
