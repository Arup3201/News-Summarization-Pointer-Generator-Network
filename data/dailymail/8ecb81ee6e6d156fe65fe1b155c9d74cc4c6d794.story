A Texas police officer who killed 19-year-old shoplifter has walked free from court despite being found guilty of manslaughter.

Russell Rios was killed during a scuffle with Sgt. Jason Blackwelder, 30, in July 2013 after he chased the teenager who was suspected of taking iPad cases worth $50 from a Walmart.

But Blackwelder has walked free from court after a jury ruled yesterday he should serve his five year sentence on probation.

Rios' family reacted with anger after the verdict, with his father, Juan Cuyun, branding it 'a joke'.

Rios' mother, Jacqueline, told reporters outside the courtroom: 'Remember, my son is a human. He’s not an animal. I think everybody respects more a dog or a cat than my son.

'The police can kill anybody and only get five years probation because they’re police, because they don’t have criminal records?

'I’m embarrassed to go outside because they laugh in my face. The justice system is laughing in my face.'

Blackwelder was off duty when he joined security guards chasing Rios from a Walmart store last year. He eventually caught up to the teenager in nearby woods, where a scuffle broke out.

Blackwelder initially claimed he shot Rios in self-defence after the teen throttled him, but later evidence showed Rios was shot in the back of the head.

Prosecutors argued that Rios was face down when the gun, which was tucked into Blackwelder's waistband without a holster, went off unintentionally.

Blackwelder was facing up to 20 years behind bars on the manslaughter charge, but his defenece argued for probation as he has no previous convictions.

His defence also argued that the fact of conviction was punishment enough as Conroe Police Department are now set to fire him. A felony conviction prevents him from working as an officer.

Neither Blackwelder nor his attorney offered any comment after the sentencing, as a federal lawsuit is still pending.

Police Chief Philip Dupuis told The Courier: 'First, the Conroe Police Department would like to extend our condolences to the Rios family at the loss of their family member.

'While knowing our words provide little comfort, our hearts understand your loss.

'It is our belief that the Conroe Police Department conducted a comprehensive investigation with integrity and ethical fortitude.'
