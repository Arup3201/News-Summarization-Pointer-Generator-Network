FOX News has come under international fire with the revelation that the network has made a very unlikely, yet highly powerful, new foe - the city of Paris.

Mayor Anne Hidalgo sat down for her first international interview since the Charlie Hebdo terrorist attack on Tuesday, telling Christiane Amanpour that it was her intent to go after the polarizing news organization for 'attacking the honor and the image' of the city in statements made in the wake of this tragedy.

More specifically, the decision by the network to introduce the anti-Muslim myth that Paris, and most of Europe, had become filled with areas they referred to as 'no go zones,' which were off limits to everyone but Muslims - including police and government officials - and governed by Sharia law.

Host Sean Hannity was the first to make mention of this on his January 7 program, saying; 'It seems if you watch in recent years, it’s not just France but all of Europe, there’s been a major influx, immigration, people from Muslim countries. They’ve even - and they’ve not assimilated, they’ve separated.'

He then added; 'They have no-go zones. If you’re non-Muslim, you’re not allowed. Not police, not even fire department if there’s a fire. Sharia courts have been allowed to be established. Prayer rugs in just about every hotel.'

Just a few days later, Jeanine Pirro welcomed analyst Steve Emerson on her show, who said of these zones, believed by many to be entirely inaccurate from the start; 'They’re sort of amorphous, they’re not contiguous necessarily, but they’re sort of safe havens.'

Emerson then took the idea a step further by stating; 'And they’re places where the governments, like France, Britain, Sweden, Germany — they don’t exercise any sovereignty so you basically have zones where Sharia courts are set up, where Muslim density is very intense, where police don’t go in.'

Finally, Emerson wrapped the segment up by making the claim that Birmingham, England was an example of one of these zones, and that 'non-Muslims just simply don’t go in.'

FOX News ultimately issued corrections for these statements, as well as an apology.

Too far: A guest of Jeanine Pirro's (above) show, Steve Emerson, even claimed that Birmingham, England was an example of a 'no go zone'

That, however, is not enough for Mayor Hidalgo. 

'When we're insulted, and when we've had an image, then I think we'll have to sue, I think we'll have to go to court, in order to have these words removed,' she told CNN's Amanpour. 

'The image of Paris has been prejudiced, and the honor of Paris has been prejudiced.'

Michael Clemente, the Executive Vice President of News at the network said in a statement; 'We empathize with the citizens of France as they go through a healing process and return to everyday life. However, we find the Mayor’s comments regarding a lawsuit misplaced.'

This as a result of the network's anti-Muslim statements following the attack, and repeated claims of what they called 'no go zones' in Europe

These 'no go zones' banned non-Muslims they claimed, and were governed by Sharia law
