A biplane of the British Royal Flying Corps and a Deutsche Luftstreitkraefte fighter hurtle towards each other in the midst of the First World War battle for the skies, crashing in flames, the pilots miraculously escaping to safety amid the smoke and the blaze...

These spectacular photographs have become famous as some of the most dramatic records of the war in the air, and are expected to fetch a princely sum at auction in Australia today.

Yet they're all completely bogus.

Clash of the titans: The photographs appear to show British and German warplanes mid-combat

That hasn't stopped Wesley David Archer's photographs from becoming coveted by collectors - partly for their bizarre history.

The photos first came to public notice in the 1930s, when one 'Gladys Maud Cockburne-Lange', who claimed to be the widow of a British air ace, went to a publisher with a trove of photos her husband had reportedly taken with a camera mounted on his plane.

Mrs Cockburne-Lange claimed the pilot had set up the shutter to be triggered with a machine gun.

The publisher at the time was understandably wowed by the incredible shots - so much so that he paid $20,000 for the work.

The pictures then became the basis for a book, Death In The Air: The War Diary And Photographs Of A Flying Corps Pilot, which was published in 1933.

Archer claimed it was the journal of an anonymous Flying Corps pilot killed in combat.

Incredible: The pilot appears to eject to safety from the German fighter plane

True story: The pictures formed the basis of a book of Archer's experiences, even though they had been set up with miniature planes on wires

The photos caused a sensation, appearing in newspapers and gallery exhibitions.

To begin with, no one seemed to notice that the clear, high-speed images were well beyond the capabilities of cameras and film available at the time.

Nor did the fact that British aeroplanes were smack in the middle of several frames - meaning the pilot would have been firing on his mates - raise any initial eyebrows.

The 'widow' quickly disappeared from public view once she had cashed in on the images.

But it wasn’t until 1984 that the images were definitely declared fakes, after the effects of Wesley David Archer - a former American pilot and early movie special effects man - were donated to the Smithsonian Institution in Washington D.C.

The trove included a number of photos similar to the Cockburn-Lange images — but before Archer had airbrushed out the wires holding up the miniature planes.

Archer, according to Petapixel.com, had fallen on hard times during the Depression.

He created the aerial tableaux, using his skills in visual trickery, then had his wife pose as Mrs. Cockburn-Lange to sell them.

The money they made from the fake shots was enough to tide the couple over until Archer could find a more suitable outlet for his talents in the film industry.

Bidding starts today at Noble Numismatics for a collection of 34 of the images.
