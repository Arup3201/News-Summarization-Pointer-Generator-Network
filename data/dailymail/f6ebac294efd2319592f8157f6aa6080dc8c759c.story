Firebrand Islamic preacher Mohammed Junaid Thorne has described the 18-year-old man shot dead last night as a 'wonderful, practicing (sic) brother' who was 'murdered by authorities'.

Police allege the teenager, since named as Numan Haider, stabbed two police officers near Endeavour Hills police station around 7:45pm last night before he was shot dead.

The Perth radical, in his mid-20s, made the remarks in a Facebook post late last night. Police have said they had 'no choice' but to shoot the 'terror suspect'.

Controversial figure: Mohammed Junaid Thorne made the statement last night.

'Murdered': The remarks made by the firebrand preacher this morning. 

Thorne, who has reportedly claimed to have memorised the Koran by age six, has recently made a number of controversial statements about Australia. 

Last Thursday, he issued a statement labelling the Australian government 'the real terrorists', following the largest ever counter-terrorism raids in the nation's history.

He said the Australian government wants to 'destroy Islam by any means...closing down Islamic centres, raiding Muslim houses, arresting active Muslim youth and preachers, intimidating Muslims cancelling their passports... and creating a vibe of fear within the Australian community to make them afraid of Muslims'.  

In August, he posted to Facebook saying scholars who support the Islamic State terror group are 'on the front lines, in the battlefields, backing their words with actions'. 

He told Daily Mail Australia this morning that today was a 'time of grief for us Muslims'. 

His comments came as moderate Muslim leader Dr Jamal Rifi warned that the country must allow the authorities time to finish their investigations into the Tuesday night's stabbing. 

Justice Minister Michael Keenan praised the officers' 'bravery' and 'dedication' in a press conference on Wednesday morning. 

Mr Keenan said the police appeared to have acted in self-defence against a 'known terror suspect'.

'This incident occurred during a police investigation and it appears that the shooting by the police officer was in self-defence.' 

Victorian Premier Denis Napthine today praised the officers. 

He said any death is 'tragic', irrespective of the circumstances, and that his thoughts were with the family of the deceased

Police take bags of evidence away from the scene of last night's incident. 

A crime scene was established near the Endeavour Hills Police Station.

Prime Minister Tony Abbott described the attack  as 'fierce'. In a video statement, Mr Abbott said: 'Obviously this indicates there are people in our community who are capable of very extreme acts.'  

The Islamic Council of Victoria has called for a 'full and objective investigation' into how the incident came about so 'such a tragedy is never repeated'. 

Ghaith Krayem, the organisation's Secretary, said in a statement the organisation felt 'deep sorrow' about 'last night's tragic events'.  

'Events that, on face value, should not have cost a young man his life and put two police officers in hospital.

'Our focus, at this time, is on supporting the family of the young man; ensuring that their needs are catered for.'

Mr Krayem said the incident showed the 'real cost of a failure to deal with these serious issues which is why we have made numerous calls on the Australian government to deal with the root causes of alienation and disaffection of people such as this.'    

He said no one should try to 'inflame' the situation and 'everyone should be calling for calm'.
