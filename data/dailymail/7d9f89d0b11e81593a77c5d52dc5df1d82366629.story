A young woman suffered two strokes and was left partially paralysed before turning 22 - the second attack coming a year to the day after the first. 

Lauren Bradfield mistook the signs of the first deadly brain bleed, a blinding headache and dizziness, for a hangover. 

At the age of just 20, she was left paralysed down her left side, from her neck to her feet and told by doctors she may never walk again.

After three months in hospital and intensive treatment, in September last year - a year to the day after Miss Bradfield suffered her first stroke - she collapsed the victim of a second at the age of 21.

Less than a year on from that attack, which left her unable to move the left side of her body, Miss Bradfield has made a 'miraculous recovery' learning to walk again and take part in a 10k run.  

Lauren Bradfield, 22, was left partially paralysed twice before her 22nd birthday, after suffering two strokes, the second exactly a year after the first

At just 20-years old, Miss Bradfield was told she would never walk again after suffering a bleed in her brain

About a quarter of strokes in the UK occur in people under 65 years, according to The Stroke Association.

Miss Bradfield said being able to defy expectation was a great feeling after the shattering experience of being told she would never walk again - twice.

She said: 'Everyone has been totally shocked at how far I've come since my first stroke.

'Being told twice that I may never walk again was a horrendous experience.

'I am still very early on in my recovery and at times it feels like I am 92 rather than 22 but doctors have been astounded that I've proved them wrong.

'I am just grateful that I am still alive, let alone being able to run races.'

Miss Bradfield, a lab assistant, suffered her first stroke aged 20 in 2012 - when she mistook the symptoms for a hangover.

But after a blinding headache gave way to dizziness and being unable to stand, she realised something was more seriously wrong.

A scan found a bleed on her brain and she was immediately admitted to a neurological unit for round-the-clock care.

A stroke is a brain attack.

It happens when the blood supply to part of your brain is cut off. It can be caused by a blockage in one of the blood vessels leading to the brain or a bleed in the brain.

Blood carries essential nutrients and oxygen to your brain. Without blood your brain cells can be damaged or destroyed.

Strokes affect people in different ways, depending on the part of the brain that is affected, how widespread the damage is and how healthy the person was before the stroke. 

A stroke can affect the way your body functions as well as your thought processes and how you feel and communicate.

A stroke can also have an emotional impact and can cause problems such as anxiety, depression or changes to your personality.

What causes a stroke?

Most strokes happen when a blood clot blocks the flow of blood to your brain. Blood clots usually form in areas where the arteries have become narrowed or ‘furred’ up by fatty deposits. This is called atheroscelrosis.

As we age our arteries become harder and narrower. However, certain medical conditions and lifestyle factors can speed up this process and increase your risk of having a stroke.

Medical problems like diabetes, high blood pressure and high cholesterol can increase your risk of having a stroke.

Lifestyle factors, such as diet, drinking alcohol, taking drugs, smoking and how active you are, can also increase your risk.

After suffering the massive stroke, Miss Bradfield was left completely unable to move her left side from the neck downwards.

She said: 'I was stunned - I didn't think that people my age had strokes.

'I got a headache when I was out on a day trip where I had a few drinks, but I didn't think anything of it, I assumed it was just the heat or the alcohol.

'But when this got worse the next day, I found it difficult to stand up and knew something was seriously wrong.

'After my stroke, the next week was a bit of a blur, I was unable to move which was terrifying.'

Miss Bradfield was then sent for another round of tests which revealed two major blood clots on her brain.

It was then she was told by doctors that she may never walk again. She was in such a critical condition she was moved to a neurological rehabilitation unit.

Determined to get her life back on track, Miss Bradfield spent three months in hospital.

She said: 'I was terrified, but I wasn't going to give up that easily.

'They weren't sure of the prognosis at the time and a part of it was just a waiting game but thanks to the amazing doctors and nurses who picked up on this, eventually it did save my life.

'It was a life or death situation because the drugs they used were meant to prevent more clots but at the same time could have made the bleed worse which could have been fatal.'

However, in September 2013, a year to the day after her first stroke, Miss Bradfield collapsed unexpectedly

Once again she was left partially paralysed down her left side.

She was told for a second time she may never be able to walk again, and plagued by the thought of reliving the harrowing ordeal, she broke down in tears.

But remarkably, Miss Bradfield, whose family has a significant history of blood clots, made a rapid recovery and was only in hospital for two weeks before she returned home.

After a couple of months of intensive rehab she was finally able to walk again without aid.

She said: 'It was hard to see my friends graduate and look at their pictures all over Facebook when I was helpless.

'They were able to get on with their lives when I felt stuck and trapped.

'It has made me realise that life can be taken away from you at any point and so unexpectedly so it really is important to make the most of every second, because life is too short.' 

Miss Bradfield collapsed a year to the day after her first stroke, in September 2013, the victim of a second attack aged just 21 

Miss Bradfield's family have a history of blood clots, which can cause stroke if they block the blood supply to the brain. She credits her family with her quick recovery after her second stroke

Fully recovered after months of intense rehab, Miss Bradfield is now able to go to work, play hockey and even ran a 10k race to raise money for The Stroke Association

The causes of Miss Bradfield's strokes are unknown, but she now has to take blood thinning tablets for life to keep the symptoms under control.

But having raised £700 for The Stroke Association by running the London Bupa 10,000, she is determined to keep her strokes at bay and continue to lead an active life.

'I am back to working full time and playing hockey so things really are getting back on track and I am grateful to so many people for this,' she added.

Nikki Hill, deputy director of external affairs at the Stroke Association, said: 'A stroke is all too often thought of as a condition that only affects older people, but the condition can happen to anyone at any age.

'A stroke is a brain attack it happens when the blood supply to part of your brain is cut off by a bleed or a blood clot.

'It is relatively rare to have a stroke under the age of 25, but a quarter of strokes occur in people under 65 years old.

'We know that lifestyle factors, such as a lack of exercise, and a poor diet, are leading to an increase in obesity and diabetes - both important risk factors for stroke.

'The progress we've made in reducing stroke incidence will be lost unless people take control of their health and reduce their risk of stroke.'
