A lucky football fan has won £1,250 after accidentally tipping MK Dons to beat Manchester United 4-0.

Aviation worker Holly Griffiths, 20, decided to take a punt on United for their second round Capital One Cup clash with League One outfit MK Dons.

But instead of placing her £2.50 free bet from bookies Paddy Power on the Red Devils, she lumped it on the Dons.

In doing so, she was just one of 14 people in the UK to do so at a cool 500/1, meaning her return was a hefty £1,250.

The Manchester United fan, from Manchester, said: 'I put a bet on United last Sunday with Paddy Power, I have the app on my phone.

'Because they lost, I got my money back as a free bet and forgot about it until I was in the pub with my mates last night.

'I don't really bet - only the odd quid here and there - but my mate told me she had put on United to win 4-0, so I thought I might as well do that with my free bet.

'I also put a pound on us to win 3-0 - well I thought I did but I obviously wasn't concentrating and clicked the wrong button so I bet on MK Dons.

'I stopped watching it after it was 3-0 as for me it wasn't much fun anymore.

'It was only when I checked my app again at 3-0 that I realised what had happened, it was a weird feeling.

'I wanted United to win, but I wanted MK Dons to score again so I could win the money, I couldn't watch the last 10 minutes and had to tell my friends to let me know what happened.

'I haven't got a clue what I am going to spend my money on, I am still in a bit of shock, this has all happened so quickly.

'My friends were joking around saying I should give them a cut, I have taken the money out of the betting account, but I just don't know what to do with it yet.'

The minnows cruised to a shock victory at Stadium MK with two goals from Will Grigg and on-loan Arsenal youngster Benik Afobe.
