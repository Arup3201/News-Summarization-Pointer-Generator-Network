Four out of five new mothers now opt to give birth while listening to music, a new poll has found

Four out of five new mothers listened to music while they gave birth - with Diana Ross' 'Ain't No Mountain High Enough' and 'Roar' by Katy Perry the most popular choices, a poll has revealed.

Researchers quizzed 1,030 mothers online and found most felt music helped them maintain some sense of control during the final stages of labour.

Among their favourite ante-natal anthems were 'Greatest Day' by Take That, 'Angels' by Robbie Williams and 'You're Beautiful', by James Blunt.

The Beatles classic 'Let it Be' also made the top 10, as did 'Circle of Life' from the Lion King.

'I'm Every Woman' by Chaka Khan and 'Empire State of Mind' by Alicia Keys & Jay Z can also be frequently heard emanating from the delivery suite, according to the report by parenting club Bounty.

Lisa Penney, a spokeswoman for the club, said: 'Research has shown familiar music can help mums feel calm and in control when giving birth.

'And in a practical sense it can also help to block out distractions in the delivery room, such as background noise.

'With modern technology now allowing us to download music whenever and wherever we want, it's unsurprising that we've seen a growing trend amongst mums-to-be for creating special playlists for labour.'

The poll also found that, although many mums said they liked listening to music when they gave birth, two-thirds (61 per cent) could not actually remember which song their baby was born to.

According to the research, most motherss used a mixture of genres on their playlists.

Classical was the most popular genre (polling 15 per cent), followed by easy listening (14 per cent), pop (eight per cent), nature sounds, such as waves and whale sounds (six per cent) and rock (which also gained six per cent of the vote).

Mothers also believed their choice of music had an impact on their newborn baby, the report found.

Many of the mums polled chose music because they wanted the baby to hear it when they arrived into the world, researchers were told.

1. Ain’t No Mountain High Enough - Diana Ross

2. Roar - Katy Perry

3. Angels - Robbie Williams

4. Greatest Day - Take That

5. You’re Beautiful - James Blunt

6. I’m Every Woman - Chaka Khan

7. Let it Be - The Beatles

8. Circle of Life - Elton John

9. Ave Maria - JS Bach

10. Empire State of Mind - Alicia Keys & Jay

DJ Fearne Cotton has said that she couldn't give birth without 
music playing and Kate Middleton, the Duchess of Cambridge made a labour
 playlist, which contained music by Calvin Harris, Bruno Mars and Of 
Monsters and Men.

And US singer Mariah Carey celebrated the birth of twins Moroccan and Monroe by playing her own smash hit 'We Belong Together'.

Ms Penney added: 'Labour playlists are fast becoming an essential part of mums' hospital bag today, but mums should think carefully about the music they choose to create the best atmosphere possible for birth.

'And when it comes to the type of music, our research shows it all comes down to personal taste when making the delivery room feel like home.

'Although you may want to consider whether head-banging heavy metal will really create the most relaxing environment to welcome a baby into the world.'
