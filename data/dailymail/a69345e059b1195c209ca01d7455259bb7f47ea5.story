Benefits Street star White Dee is reportedly set to earn £100,000 to appear in the next Celebrity Big Brother.

The 42-year-old, whose real name is Deirdre Kelly, was rumoured to have been offered the huge payment to appear on the TV show after shooting to notoriety because of her state-funded lifestyle.

She had shunned paid media work after finding fame on the Channel 4 welfare dependency documentary, but this week accepted £500 for a TV appearance ahead of the Big Brother rumour emerging.

Another reality TV role? Benefits Street star White Dee is reportedly set to earn £100,000 to appear in the next Celebrity Big Brother

Welfare queen: White Dee, pictured above in a promotional photo for Channel 4's Benefits Street, has claimed she no longer receives state handouts, as rumours surface that she to take the big-money TV deal

The £100,000, reported in The Sun, is said to be one of the largest offered to a potential guest.

Dee herself also seems keen to appear on the show - she has raised the possibility to fans on Twitter, and frequently posts updates about the show.

A source told the newspaper: 'Dee will be great on Celebrity Big Brother. She is used to sitting around the house all day long and being paid for it.'

However, Dee's agent has denied that any deal has been struck, despite her being 'keen' to appear.

The star has hit headline repeatedly for her views on welfare dependency and who should be eligible for state support.

This week she revealed that she no longer received benefits, and  admitted the welfare system is far too open to abuse.

She had sparked anger by insisting she still deserves handouts while headlining bar crawls in Magaluf and pocketing fees for TV appearances.

After reports that the Department of Work and Pensions were investigating her benefits, she revealed on Monday that she is no longer receiving state support.

Pay day: According to The Sun newspaper, the 42-year-old - whose real name is Deirdre Kelly - will be one of the big earners on the programme's next series and she is already being tipped as a possible winner

Speaking on ITV's This Morning, she explained: 'Maybe it shouldn't be made so comfortable for people on benefits.

'There are genuine people on benefits who do really want to find a job but then there's other people who are so comfortable that they are thinking: "Well why should I find a job, because I'm perfectly happy living how I am?" '

Presenter Phillip Schofield then revealed Dee was getting £500 for the 20-minute appearance on the show.

The prospect of more lucrative TV work certainly appears close to Dee's heart.

However, despite the rumour, and Dee's obvious enthusiasm for the programme her agent today denied a deal had been made.

Speaking to MailOnline, he said the reports and the figure were 'ridiculous' and that the show would clash with other commitments, including a planned cookery show in France.

He said: 'Dee is keen to do Big Brother, but they've got to offer you a place.There are also issues of her health - we're not sure how she would cope in the Big Brother house for days at a time.' 

Other stars who have been linked to the next Celerity Big Brother, which starts in August, include former TOWIE brunette Lauren Goodger, but she has since denied that she will be taking part in the reality TV series. 

She was said to have accepted a six-figure deal to star in the Channel 5 reality series, but her spokesman told MailOnline that was completely false.

Lauren also took to Twitter to dispel these rumours on Wednesday, writing: 'Just seen a tweet or paper that I've signed up for a show and bringing past in2 it again! Not true once again please leave me out it #nonsense'.
