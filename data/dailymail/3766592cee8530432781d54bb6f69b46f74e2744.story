Diane Stretton, the ex-nanny who 'squatted' inside a California family's home after being hired off of Craigslist, is now out.

CBSLosAngeles reported Wednesday that Stretton, 64, is no longer living inside the Bracamonte family's Upland residence. 

Some of her belongings are still there, the station said.

Marcella 
Bracamonte, 31, told MailOnline in a June interview when Stretton moved in things began well and she and 
Ralph, 35, baked a cake for their baby daughter’s birthday with her 
help.

The photo of the nanny grinning with the freshly baked cake has now been beamed around the world.

Marcella
 said: 'She moved in the week of March 4 and March 8 was my baby’s 
birthday, so that picture was taken March 7, we all made a cake 
together. It was fun, I thought how fun, we could do this again every 
year, I planned on her staying a long time, and she could have stayed a 
long time she just had to help me.'

The nanny also settled in quickly and would use the family’s swimming pool.

Marcella
 said: 'She would get in her bathing suit, come out have a beer with us,
 barbecue, music. She liked it. She would sit in the layout chairs and 
sunbathe she would go in the inflatable and lie in the pool.'

However
 the first signs of trouble came three weeks in when she began to refuse
 to do housework or watch the children if Marcella - who had wanted to 
set up her own business at home - wanted to go out for meetings.

Good riddance: Diane Stretton, 64, has left the home of her former employers - months after she stopped working for them

Had enough: Mother-of-three Marcella Bracamonte said she chose to speak out about what happened to her family to stop Diane Stretton doing it to anyone else

Stretton would use the pool at the family's home in Upland, California, and 'settled in quickly'

On the move: Stretton used to live out of her silver Pontiac Grand Am (pictured) for days at a time

She said:  'After three weeks she would be like leaning on things and acting out of breath [while cleaning the floor]. My house is not very dirty… there was not a lot of work you had to do.

'All of a sudden it was like '‘It’s so hot in here'', ''You need to put the air on'’.

'I would make her breakfast, lunch and dinner she never came and helped me prepare those meals, but she was there to eat it and this was from day one.

'I asked her to clean her bathroom, she did it but then she threw a fit, she stomped out of the bathroom, went to her room, slammed the door and stayed in there the whole day and never came out….. She said it was too hard. She was like a teenager, it was like taking care of another child. It was like she felt she was entitled to us taking care of her.'

Stretton didn’t mention her health problems when she took the job.

Stumped: Marcella and Ralph Bracamonte with their three children, ages, 11, 4 and one

Marcella said: 'She never told me she had COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) when I hired her, she told me nothing, she said she was perfectly happy. I said ‘'is there anything you can tell me that might prevent you performing this job?'’ and she said no.'

On Mother’s Day Ralph even cooked the nanny a special meal.

Marcella said: 'He made her a steak dinner, he served her and he said ‘'happy Mother’s Day, and she said thank you. Yeah it makes me angry, because we treated her like family we loved her.'

Stretton has even filed paperwork to try and force the Bracamontes OUT of their own home, pictured here

 Marcella told MailOnline in June: 'Ralphy says ‘Mummy I don’t love Diane anymore, I was going to marry her, but not anymore, she hurts my heart’.

'He’s four, and he loved her, he loved her like grandma, he would give her hugs. They were real close and then all of a sudden she didn’t want nothing to do with them anymore.'

Marcella admitted she made a mistake hiring Stretton but believed publicizing it as she has will stop the nanny from doing it to anyone else.

She said: 'I buy a lot of things from Craigslist, I’ve never met a psycho in my life except for her.

'I called three references… I can’t get blamed for her not being honest with me. She seemed nice.

'I made a mistake as a mom, I’m not going to be the first one who’s made a mistake.

'I’m just the first mom to put it on public television and in the media, I own up to it because this can happen to anyone, not just a nanny, but anyone you have in your house. It’s not about a nanny, it has everything to do about the law, that’s my point.'

Asked what her message is to Stretton, a defiant Marcella said:  'If I could say one thing to her right now, it would be ‘'You can never do this again and get away with it, you will go the rest of your life now being labeled and I did this for everybody you victimized because it’s not right. You’re never going to do this again''.'

Careful: Mrs Bracamonte, pictured with her children, said she carried out background checks on the woman

While showing MailOnline the letter Stretton gave her when she first tried to get rid of her, Marcella said: 'She wrote me a letter, it’s a letter of extortion I feel, telling me I can be at my house at this time and this time, and that I need to feed her healthy food or give her $200, she wrote it to get me really upset, to get me furious and she did get me furious, but I didn’t respond to her.

'She’s playing games, she knows I have a very short temper and she’s trying to wind me up, she’s not going to do it because I know her game, I’m not going to get wound up.

'She’s a liar in the upmost form. It’s terrible there’s people like that. I think she’s a scorpion, it’s just in her blood.'

Marcella did feel some pity for the nanny, adding: 'I do feel sorry for her, but she’s not a very nice person. I wonder where it went wrong for her?

'She told me her sister’s swindled her too. She made me feel sorry for her.

'I would love to talk to her sisters, because she’s put her sisters through hell, I almost want to tell them this one’s for them.'

Asked if she will ever get a nanny again after this, Marcella said: 'No never. First of all, I would not want anyone to come in my house to live with me… I’m not even going to have a houseguest. I’ve been put off for life.'

'Obviously there needs to be a law changed, we are going to go through a procedure and America is watching how difficult it can be to get someone out of your house. And that’s a good thing [as it might get the law changed].'
