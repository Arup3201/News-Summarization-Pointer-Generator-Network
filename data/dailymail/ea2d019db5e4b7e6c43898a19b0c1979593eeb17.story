Luis Suarez's transfer to Barcelona is being held up because Chile star Alexis Sanchez - his proposed replacement - is a wanted man across Europe.

Liverpool would like Sanchez in part-exchange for Suarez.

But Sanchez is being courted by Arsenal as well as Juventus and would prefer those clubs to Anfield.

Barca want the winger to consider Liverpool's offer because it would help them land Suarez at a reduced price but the decision rests with the player.

Catalan TV stations reported that a fee of £75million was agreed with Suarez handed a five year deal that would make him their fourth highest paid player behind Lionel Messi, Neymar and Andres Iniesta.

Liverpool are continuing to negotiate though and want to establish whether there is a chance of signing Sanchez.
