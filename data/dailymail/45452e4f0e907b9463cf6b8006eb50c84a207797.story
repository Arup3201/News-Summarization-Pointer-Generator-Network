Labor MP Anthony Albanese certainly did not beat around the bush when he was asked for a statement about the retirement of the chairman of Sydney Airport.

Social media lit up when Mr Albanese sent out a one-word statement to journalist about the news.

Under the official letterhead of the Australia coat of arms, Mr Albanese's reply to Max Moore-Wilton announcing he was stepping down read: 'Good'.

Twitter users immediately dubbed the Shadow Minister for Infrastructure and Transport's response as the 'best press release ever'.

One woman called it a 'legendary press release', while another said it was 'brilliant in its brevity'.

A man joked he would try to live up to the high standard Mr Albanese had taken press releases.

'From today onwards, I will endeavour to emulate @albomp's media release skillz,' he wrote.

The feud between Mr Albanese and Mr Moore-Wilton dates back to 2011 when the chairman threatened take legal action against the then-Minister for Infrastructure and Transport, according to Fairfax Media.Â 

During debate over a second airport in Sydney, Mr Albanese fired off that Mr Moore-Wilton should not be included in consultation as he had a 'monopoly over the existing airport'.

The MP supported a second airport coming to Sydney, while Mr Moore-Wilton was not keen on the idea.

Mr Moore-Wilton's time as chairman will come to an end in May.
