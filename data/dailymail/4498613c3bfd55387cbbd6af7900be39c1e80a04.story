Former Arsenal, Barcelona and Manchester City left-back Sylvinho has been appointed assistant manager to Roberto Mancini at Inter Milan.

The Brazilian becomes ex-City manager Mancini's No 2 at the San Siro following a coaching role at Corinthians last year, and Sylvinho has admitted he wants to upgrade to management some day.

'I'm going to Italy,' Sylvinho told Uol. 'I thought about it for 20 days, day and night and I've decided - along with my family - to accept Inter's proposal.

'I'm glad Inter made the offer, it's a huge opportunity for me, one which will allow me to improve a lot as an assistant coach. Later on, I can start to forge my career as a coach.

'I'm happy with my time at Corinthians, both were big projects and it wasn't easy to make a decision but I hope I've made the right one.'

Sylvinho made 55 Premier League appearances for Arsenal between 1999 and 2001, before later playing for Barcelona for five years. 

The 40-year-old left the Nou Camp for the Etihad in 2009, where he ended his playing career.
