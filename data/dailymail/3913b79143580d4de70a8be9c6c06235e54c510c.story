A University of Alabama athlete died after protecting his girlfriend from a collapsing wall on Monday evening.

A retaining wall collapsed on men's swimming and diving team member John Servati, 21, while he stayed in an off-campus home's basement with a friend, WSFA reports. He was taken to DCH Regional Medical Center and later pronounced dead.

Anna Rae Gwarjanski, captain of the University's women's swimming and diving team, tweeted that Servati managed to hold up the wall and save his girlfriend's life that night, Al.com reports.

Hero: John Servati, pictured, died on Monday evening. Servati was reportedly able to save his girlfriend's life before a retaining wall collapsed on top of him

Scholar-athlete: Servati, a member of the men's swimming and diving team at the University of Alabama, was a successful business major with a 3.55 GPA

'John Servati died a hero. Held up a concrete wall long enough for his girlfriend to get out from under it before it collapsed again on him,' she said.

'John's mom told our team this morning he always wanted to be an Alabama swimmer, and he always wanted to be a hero. He accomplished both.'

Servati was a business student from Tupelo, Mississippi, according to his University bio page, and scored at the SEC Championships. A successful student, he was also listed as having a 3.55 GPA in 2013.

'John Servati was an extraordinary young man of great character and warmth who had a tremendously giving spirit,' UA head coach Dennis Pursley said in a statement. 'During this incredibly difficult time, our thoughts and prayers go out to his family and to all who had the good fortune to know him. He will forever be in our hearts and a part of the Crimson Tide legacy.'

'John definitely had a genuine heart,' Alabama swimming and diving team captain Phillip Deaton said

'John definitely had a genuine heart,' team captain Phillip Deaton added. 'He was a carefree guy who always had this huge smile on his face. He was my training partner for three years and I can tell you that while he liked to goof around and have fun, when he stepped up on the block he was intensely focused - he was a competitor and an amazing teammate. As a team, we are doing the best we can right now.'

Servati was among an estimated 34 killed across six states due to tornadoes unleashed by a ferocious storm system that razed neighborhoods and threatened more destruction in heavily populated parts of the U.S. South on Tuesday.  

Support: Women's team captain Anna Rae Gwarjanski shared these messages after learning of Servati's death

'John's mom told our team this morning he always wanted to be an Alabama swimmer, and he always wanted to be a hero. He accomplished both' women's captain Anna Rae Gwarjanski said

In Arkansas and Mississippi, the hardest hit states, there have been 27 confirmed storm-related deaths and more than 200 people injured over the last three days as tornadoes reduced homes to splinters, snapped trees like twigs and sent trucks flying through the air like toys.

Deaths were also reported in Oklahoma and Iowa on Sunday, and Alabama and Tennessee on Monday.

Makeshift shelters have been set up for thousands of families forced out of their homes while the National Guard, local police and residents who had lost all their possessions sifted through the rubble looking for more victims.
