Real Madrid’s 16-year-old wonderkid Martin Odegaard set up two goals on his Real Madrid debut in a behind closed-doors friendly for the B-team against Beijing Guoan and was then named in Carlo Ancelotti's Champions League squad.

The Norwegian will wear the No 21 shirt and if he makes his debut in the last-16 matches against Schalke he will become the youngest debutant ever in the competition beating Celestine Babayaro who played his first Champions League game aged 16 years and 87 days for Anderlecht.

The club have still not officially announced the 25 players who make up the A-list for the knockout stages  but Odegaard is set to be included having impressed in his first week of training, and the midfielder cannot be named on the B-list of stand-by youth team players because he has not been at the club for at least two years.

On Wednesday Odegaard's debut came against Chinese team Beijing Guoan, coached by Spaniard Gregorio Manzano who previously worked at Atletico Madrid and Mallorca in Spain.

Odegaard's mission in what remains of this season is to help the club’s B-team Real Madrid Castilla win promotion from the third division into Spain’s second tier. 

He could now be given his full debut on Sunday against Athletic Bilbao B at the Alfredo Di Stefano Stadium at Real’s Valdebebas training ground.

Norwegian Odegaard was made to feel at home on his debut as temperatures in Madrid plummeted to just above freezing.
