The glamorous 25-year-old blonde posted a picture online of the two of them, sparking rumours of a romance, according to ciudad.com.

However, Ms Amodeo has already moved to quash talk of a relationship after she took to Facebook in an attempt to clarify the situation.

After describing Maradona as a 'genius' she then suggested she would not go out with a person of the 'age of my dad'. 

She ended the message: 'So just friendship.'

The World Cup winner is currently locked in a legal battle with his ex-girlfriend Rocio Oliva.

The 24-year-old, an ex women’s football player, was arrested after Maradona accused her of stealing more than £200,000 of valuables from his mansion in Dubai.

He had asked her to leave the home following an argument over Manchester United goalie David de Gea.

She was detained on an international arrest warrant as she landed at Buenes Aires, the Mirror reported on July 17.

The former footballer had accused her of taking jewellery worth almost £250,000.
