Tragic: Emma Smith was walking with her dog Bell in a field when she was knocked to the ground and repeatedly sat on by cows

A midwife is in hospital after she was stamped on, thrown and sat on by a herd of cows while walking her dog.

Emma Smith suffered serious chest wounds and crushed ribs in the attack as the cows tried to protect their young calves.

The 38-year-old was crossing a field when her dog disturbed a herd of cows and their offspring.

Miss Smith tripped and fell as the animals chased her and the cows then took turns to sit and roll on her.

More cows then joined the attack near St Martin, on the Lizard peninsula in Cornwall, barging Miss Smith from behind as she tried to get up and leaving her drenched in blood.

She managed to crawl under an electric fence to escape and was airlifted to hospital where she is still recovering a month after the ordeal.

Doctors say she will take at least a year to recover and may never work again.

Yesterday Miss Smith warned the public to stay away from cows.

She said: ‘I’ve never seen cows act like that before – this must never happen to anyone else again.’

Miss Smith moved to Cornwall from Shrewsbury the weekend before she was attacked to start a job as a midwife at the Royal Cornwall Hospital in Truro.

She took her dog, Bell, for a walk on a short lead using a familiar route near her parents’ home.

Miss Smith began to cross a field of cattle on a public right of way but soon found herself surrounded by a herd of cows.

Her mother Susan Moody explained: ‘Emma assessed the situation and said the cows looked up but took no notice of her or her dog.

‘She was just over halfway across the field when a cow started to run towards her, followed by many others.

‘The cows weren’t going to stop. One charged from behind and she was tossed in the air.

‘She managed to get up after this but she was charged yet again, from the front this time.

‘After she regained consciousness, she
became aware different cows were dropping themselves on top of her – 
presumably with the intention of crushing her. She managed to crawl away
between episodes of unconsciousness.’

A critically injured Miss Smith managed to stagger along a path to a neighbour’s farm where she collapsed.

A Navy search and rescue helicopter 
from nearby RNAS Culdrose was dispatched to airlift her to hospital in 
Bristol, where has had to undergo extensive surgery.

Mrs Moody says the law should be 
changed to keep cattle with calves out of fields with public access and 
require signs to warn of the danger. She said of her daughter: ‘Her life
is on hold for a year at least, we’ve been told. She’s sustained 
life-changing injuries.

Covered in blood from cuts to her face and with both wrists broken, she dragged herself across the field, while the cows continued to fall on her

‘Emma is a very experienced, dedicated midwife and hopes to return to her job eventually if her health permits.

‘If only there had been a warning sign that cows with calves could be dangerous, then Emma wouldn’t have entered the field.

‘These recommendations should become law to ensure no other family has to go through what we’ve had to contend with.’

Unexpected: Miss Smith has warned of the dangers of cows especially when they are protecting their calves
