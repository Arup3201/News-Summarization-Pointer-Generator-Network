John Tatton forced a teenager to pay her rent in 'sexual favours'

A teenage girl who was forced to pay her rent with 'sexual favours' to an infamous trafficking gang has helped jail a tenth predatory paedophile.

The victim, who was 15 at the time, was abused by landlord John Tatton, 72, after he forced her to pay the rent in 'sexual favours.'

At the time the girl was being repeatedly abused by members of a group of nine men who preyed on underage teenage girls in Heywood, Rochdale, Greater Manchester, and who were later jailed for a total of 77 years.

During police investigations into the ring, the girl told officers about her abuse ordeal at the hands of Tatton at a house in Rochdale.

Today Tatton was jailed for four years after being convicted of five offences of sexual activity with a child and one offence of sexual assault.

The girl had to testify against him during the five day trial, and she was one of a number of girls who gave evidence in the trial last year. 

Police said the victim had been going through some 'difficult times' at home and started to form friendships with a number of other teenage girls who had chaotic lifestyles involving alcohol, drugs and eventual sexual exploitation.

She moved into a house in Heywood, near Rochdale, with a number of these other girls.

Tatton, who owned the house, told the victim she couldn’t live there rent free and had to pay for her stay with sexual favours.

Bolton Crown Court was told she was sexually abused by Tatton repeatedly over the course of six months.

Tatton, now of Hanley, Stoke On Trent, denied wrongdoing.

But Detective Constable Dave South, of Greater Manchester Police said: 'Tatton is a sexual predator who took complete advantage of a vulnerable teenage girl.

'He subjected her to a campaign of abuse over a six month period, during which she was forced to submit to him to "pay" for her rent.

'Tatton is clearly a danger to young people and I hope today’s sentence provides a level of reassurance to his victim.'

Jailed: Shabir Ahmed, 59, (left) was jailed for 19 years for two rapes, aiding and abetting rape, sexual assault and trafficking for the purposes of sexual exploitation, and Abdul Aziz, 41, (right) was jailed for nine years for conspiracy and trafficking for sexual exploitation

Behind bars: Hamid Safi, 22, (left) was given four years for conspiracy and trafficking but was found not guilty of two counts of rape, and Adil Khan, 42, was found guilty of conspiracy and trafficking for sexual exploitation and jailed for eight years

Tatton was also ordered to sign the Sex Offenders Register for life.

Last May nine Asian men were convicted of the systematic grooming and sexual abuse of white girls in Heywood and Rochdale.

The
victims were vulnerable teenagers from deprived, dysfunctional 
backgrounds who were targeted in 'honeypot locations' where young people
regularly congregated, such as takeaway food shops.

Conviction: Abdul Rauf, 43, was found guilty of conspiracy and trafficking for sexual exploitation and jailed for six years

All the girls were coerced and bribed into keeping quiet about the abuse through a combination of free alcohol and drugs, food, small sums of money and other gifts.

Although some of the victims willingly had sex with their abusers, others were physically assaulted and raped by as many as five men at a time.

They were plied with drugs and alcohol and were passed around to friends and family being taken to various locations around the north of England.

One 13-year old girl recounted that, after being forced to have sex in exchange for vodka, her abuser immediately raped her again and then gave her £40 to not say anything about the incident.

Another thirteen-year-old victim had an abortion after becoming pregnant.

The investigation led to three other inquiries being launched in the town and also led to Keir Starmer, QC, the Director of Public Prosecutions, to order a major overhaul of the Crown Prosecution Service’s response to sex grooming, with the aim of increasing the number of convictions.  

Mr Starmer admitted that a failure to understand the nature of abuse by police, prosecutors and the courts meant that men who groomed teenagers for sex had escaped justice for decades.

The nine men were jailed for a total of 77 years last may, with their leader, divorced father-of-four Shabir Ahmed, 59, of Oldham, known as 'Daddy', being sentenced to 19 years.

Mohammed Sajid, 35, of Rochdale, received 12 years for conspiracy, trafficking, one count of rape and one count of sexual activity with a child.

Co-defendants: Abdul Qayyum (left), 43, and Mohammed Amin (right) 45, were both jailed for five years for their part in the grooming

Locked-up: Kabeer Hassan, 25, (left) was jailed for nine years for conspiracy and rape, and Mohammed Sajid, 35, (right) received 12 years for conspiracy, trafficking, rape and sexual activity with a child

Abdul Aziz, 41, of Rochdale, was jailed for nine years for conspiracy and trafficking for sexual exploitation, while Kabeer Hassan, 25, of Oldham, also got nine years for conspiracy and rape.

Abdul Rauf, 43, of Rochdale, was found guilty of conspiracy and trafficking for sexual exploitation and jailed for six years, and Adil Khan, 42, of Rochdale, was found guilty of conspiracy and trafficking for sexual exploitation and jailed for eight years.

Hamid Safi, 22, from Rochdale, was given four years for conspiracy and trafficking but was found not guilty of two counts of rape, and Abdul Qayyum, 43, of Rochdale, and Mohammed Amin, 45, of Rochdale, were both jailed for five years for their part in the grooming.

All of the men were placed on the Sex Offenders’ Register for life.
