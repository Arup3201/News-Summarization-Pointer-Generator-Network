Samuel Henley, a maths teacher at Gordonstoun - where Prince Charles used to go to school - will learn whether he will be banned from teaching today after he admitted making child pornography

A maths teacher at a boarding school is due to learn whether he will be barred from teaching today after he admitted having child pornography on his computer. 

Samuel Henley taught at Gordonstoun school in Moray in Scotland, a £32,000 a year independent school which counts Prince Charles and other members of the Royal Family among its alumni.

Henley escaped prison after he admitted six charges of making indecent images of children. 

A hearing today will determine whether he will be deemed fit to teach again or if he will be struck off the register.

The 32-year-old was sacked from Gordonstoun after images of naked boys as young as eight engaging in sexual acts were discovered on his computer. 

One of the pictures was headlined 'sweet boys kissing' and included images of 10 to 12-year-old boys engaging in sexual activity. 

There were also videos on the computer of young teenage boys performing sex acts on one another.

None of the children involved are believed to have been students at the 600-pupil Scottish campus. 

The images were found at a computer at his parents' home in July 2010. 

 Henley pleaded guilty on the day he was due to stand trial for 30 charges of making indecent images of children.

He admitted six charges and 24 were left to lie on file.

At a previous hearing at Chester Crown Court Judge Elgan Edwards told Henley, who had no previous convictions that the offences were not serious enough to send him to prison

Today the General Teaching Council for Scotland (GTCS) will decide whether the maths teacher should be allowed to return to the classroom.

The charges from the council say he is 'unfit to teach' due to his convictions 'making indecent photographs or pseudo-photographs of a child'.

Henley's case is listed for a full hearing at the GTCS today, and started at 10am this morning. 

The independent Gordonstoun School in Elgin in Scotland sits in 200 acres and costs £32,000 a year in fees

His career is believed to be in ruins since the incident came to light and Henley is understood to be working alongside his teacher in a shop.

Police were tipped off to search his parents' home by officers in the Netherlands who were investigating paedophiles distributing images on a file sharing website.

Henley, who taught at Gordonstoun from 2009 and was sentenced to a two year conditional discharge in February. He was also ordered to sign the sex offenders register for the next five years.

Henley is also the subject of a sex offenders prevention order, which means he is disqualified from working with children for the foreseeable future.

Prince Charles is the most famous of Gordonstoun's alumni and has previously said he hated his time at the boarding school, claiming he was bullied. 

He also said he was subjected to a cruel initiation ceremony involving being caged naked and put under a cold shower. 

Gordonstoun was founded in 1934 by Dr Kurt Hahn

Dr Hahn had fled Germany in 1933 and initially started a school with three pupils 

The next year pupil numbers increased and he signed a lease with the Gordon-Cumming family for the Gordonstoun estate

Today the school sits in 200 acres and has primary and secondary facilities

It is one of the last remaining full boarding schools, and houses 600 male and female pupils 

Prince Charles was a pupil at the school in the 1960s 

Other royal alumni include Prince Edward, who was head boy in 1982, and Zara Phillips 

Prince Andrew went to the school in the 1970s and became known for his hockey skills 

Prince Philip also went to Gordonstoun in the 1930s
