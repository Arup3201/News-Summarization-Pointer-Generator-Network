Government officials have hit out at CNN for reporting on the personal journal of murdered ambassador Chris Stevens, saying they did so against the wishes of his family.

Anderson Cooper revealed on Friday night that the news channel had used the document as a source after finding it inside the U.S. consulate in Benghazi.

But a State Department spokesman on Friday claimed that CNN had promised not to mention the journal, and described their U-turn as 'disgusting' and 'indefensible'.

New revelations: On Wednesday, Anderson Cooper, left, told Senator John McCain, right, that a 'source familiar with Ambassador Stevens' thinking' said the envoy was worried about security

Mystery source: Cooper admitted two days later the CNN found Stevens' personal journal in Libya and used information from it in its reporting

Mr Stevens died alongside three other
 Americans on September 11 when militant jihadists stormed the consulate
 in protest against an American-made anti-Muslim video.

CNN found the ambassador's personal 
journal four days later, and used it to report on his state of mind 
during Mr Cooper's primetime show on Wednesday.

However, the network broke a pledge 
to Mr Stevens' family that it would not report on the diary, said State 
Department spokesman Philippe Reines.

The family was informed within hours 
about the discovery of the journal, a hard-bound book that included 
seven handwritten pages.

CNN gave the document to an Italian 
official at the State Department's request, and it is now being returned
 to the ambassador's relative.

'Given the truth of how this was handled, CNN patting themselves on the back is disgusting,' Mr Reines said in his statement.

'Whose first instinct is to remove 
from a crime scene the diary of a man killed along with three other 
Americans serving our country, read it, transcribe it, email it around 
your newsroom for others to read and then call the family?'

In a phone call with the Stevens 
family, CNN 'agreed to abide by the clear wishes of the Stevens family, 
and pledged not to use the diary or even allude to its existence until 
hearing back from the family,' he added.

But four days later, 'They just went ahead and used it.'

CNN defended its use of the journal's contents and asked, 'Why is the State Department now attacking the messenger?'

The network continued: 'CNN did not 
initially report on the existence of a journal out of respect for the 
family, but we felt there were issues raised in the journal which 
required full reporting, which we did.'

On Wednesday's edition of Anderson 
Cooper 360, the host told Senator John McCain that 'a source familiar 
with Ambassador Stevens' thinking told us that in the months before his 
death he talked about being worried about the never-ending security 
threats that he was facing in Benghazi, and specifically about the rise 
in Islamist extremism and growing al Qaeda presence.'

Cooper added that 'the source also mentioned [Stevens] being on an al Qaeda hit list.'

Two days later, Mr Cooper 
acknowledged that the network had obtained Mr Stevens' journal, and that
 some of the information regarding the late ambassador’s thought process
 in the months leading to the deadly September 11, 2012, attack on the 
U.S. consulate in Benghazi was drawn from his entries.

'On Wednesday of this week, we 
reported that a source familiar with Ambassador Stevens' thinking said 
in the months before his death, Ambassador Stevens talked about being 
worried about what he called the never-ending security threats in 
Benghazi,' Mr Cooper told his viewers on Friday night.

'We
 also reported that the ambassador specifically mentioned the rise in 
Islamic extremism, the growing al Qaeda presence in Libya and said he 
was on an al Qaeda hit list.

'The
 information for that report, like all of CNN's reporting, was carefully
 vetted. Some of that information was found in a personal journal of 
Ambassador Stevens in his handwriting.

'We
 came upon the journal through our reporting and notified the family. At
 their request, we returned that journal to them. We reported what we 
found newsworthy in the ambassador's writings. A reporter followed up on
 what we found newsworthy, as I said, in the ambassador's writings,' Mr 
Cooper concluded.

Last memento: CNN said it notified Stevens' family of the find and at their request handed over the journal to his relatives via a third party

Shortly after 1am on Saturday, CNN published
 a story without a by-line on its website explaining how the journal 
came into its possession, and how the information it contains was used 
in the network's reporting.

The journal consisting of seven handwritten pages in a hard-bound book was found on the floor of the ravaged consulate compound where Mr Stevens was fatally wounded.

The network stated that it used Mr Stevens’ entries as tips shedding light on the situation in Libya and in Benghazi in particular.

‘CNN took the newsworthy tips and corroborated them with other sources,’ the article said.

If CNN’s version of events is to be believed, the ‘source familiar with the ambassador's thinking’ mentioned by Mr Cooper during Wednesday’s show was not Mr Stevens’ journal since the network claims it only used tips from his entries.

However, it remains unclear why CNN did not reveal that it had found the ambassador’s journal until Friday.
