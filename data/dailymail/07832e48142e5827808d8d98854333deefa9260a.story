Property tycoon Donald Trump could be setting his sights on acquiring the FBI's colossal headquarters in Washington adding an enormous concrete block to his growing empire.

Trump, who already owns several million square feet of prime Manhattan real estate, as well as buildings across the US, has hinted that he's interested in the vast building on Pennsylvania Avenue.

The billionnaire has just completed drawing up a long-term lease for the city's Old Post Office Pavilion, a block west of the FBI HQ, to transform it into a $200 million luxury hotel.

FBI interest: Donald Trump has said he is closely watching what is happening regarding the FBI HQ moving buildings, and may, or may not, consider getting involved

Donald Trump and Ivanka Trump, pictured last year, could use their $200million Post Office Pavilion hotel project in Washington, to boost their profile for future big developments in the city

And not long after the ink has dried, and Trump has turned his attention to his next major project.

The J Edgar Hoover Building, considered by some a blot on the otherwise grand boulevard landscape it sits on, was built in the mid-1970s - a Brutalist architectural epoch that often instills strong reactions from people today.

The General Services Administration (GSA), which manages real estate for the federal government, wants to cut a deal with a developer for the building, says the Washington Post.

It is looking for a developer to swap a new building with its iconic 1970s block so the FBI can move into larger, more contemporary premises, the news service said.

The iconic 1970s block is considered an eyesore by some, but Trump and his daughter Ivanka may take on the building as a project

The building has an open mezzanine and courtyard, but access to the courtyard is limited, and most of the first floor is closed for security reasons

Undeterred by the building's monstrous size and design, Trump seems keen, telling the Washington Post: 'We’ll be watching the FBI as to what’s going to happen.... Whether or not we will bid on it, we may, we may not.

'Now if we do as good a job as we will do with [the Old Post Office], people may ask us about it.'

The timing, at least, could fit nicely with Trump's schedule, the Washingoton Post notes, with his developers finishing the Old Post Office in 2015 and wondering over the street to the FBI rubix cube to start the next job.

The Trump empire has even crossed the Atlantic to Scotland where work began last year to construct a new golf club on the Menie estate in Aberdeen

His pregnant daughter Ivanka Trump is managing the Post Office, and the pair hope the grand $200 million hotel project will boost their profile for future bids, according to the news service.

It would add to a growing empire of buildings for th real estate family, that includes the Trump Nationla Dolf Club, in Loudoun, purchased  2009, the Kluge Winery and estate in Charlottesville, The Trump Tower, in Tampa, The Trump International Hotel and Tower, in Toronto, and many more.
