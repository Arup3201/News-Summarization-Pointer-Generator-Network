The adviser of Hatem Ben Arfa insists Hull City are well aware of the location of the French midfielder.

Hull boss Steve Bruce said at the weekend he did not know the whereabouts of the on-loan Newcastle United midfielder.

But Michael Ouazine, Ben Arfa's adviser, told Foot Mercato: 'They know where Hatem is, for a simple reason: they asked for his address in Paris for doping authorities.'

Ouazine insists Ben Arfa was granted permission to travel to Paris by Hull.

The former Marseille winger will have his season-long loan spell at the KC Stadium cut short in January, although Alan Pardew is unwilling to let him return to St James' Park.

Speaking on Tuesday, the Magpies boss said: 'He won't be coming back here, that's all I can say.'
