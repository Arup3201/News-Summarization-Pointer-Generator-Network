Hugging and smiling, they were a brother and sister who could not have been prouder of one another.

Mathew and Carla Stevenson were two of the most popular pupils at their primary school in rural France and renowned for being extremely close.

But last Saturday both allegedly became victims of a bitter custody battle between their English father and French mother.

Mother Stephanie Morlet, who was divorced from Julian Stevenson, wore sunglasses as she joined hundreds of school children and well-wishers in her home village

The youngsters, many of them friends of the murdered pair, wore white T-shirts and clutched white balloons in moving scenes in front of Stephanie Morlet

In a suspected double murder, 
10-year-old Mathew and five-year-old Carla are said to have had their 
throats cut by their father, Julian Stevenson.

The 48-year-old, who is originally from Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, allegedly killed them both in an alcohol-fuel rage.

Their
mother, Stephanie Morlet, came to collect them from a visit - the first
Stevenson had been allowed in three years because of his violent 
behaviour - and saw him escaping the murder scene in a suburb of Lyon on
a pair of roller-skates.

Today,
a picture of the loving little brother and sister was on display in the
village of Charantonnay, south of Lyon, where the children's former 
classmates took part in a 'white march' in support of the family.

Many
were in floods of tears as Ms Morlet, who is in her early 40s, 
walked at the head of a process of some 300 people carrying white roses 
and white balloons. 

'They 
were hugely popular children,' said Marie-Jeanne Chesneau. 'Our aim 
today is to show how much they meant to us, and how much we miss them.'

Emotional: The picture went on display in the village of Charantonnay, south of Lyon, before taken on a 'white march' led by their tearful mother

Heartbroken: Many of the 300-strong march were in floods of tears as they carried white roses and white balloons in support of the family

Tight-knit community: The Morlet family had moved to the village some six years ago and Mathew and Carla enrolled at the local school in 2010

Devastated: Mrs Morlet wore dark glasses as she walked through the village surrounded by family members

Mrs
Chesneau said the Morlet family had moved to the village some six years
ago, and Mathew and Carla enrolled at the local village school in 2010.

This was around the time that Ms Morlet was divorcing Stevenson because of his violent behaviour.

Mrs Morlet wore dark glasses today as she walked through the town surrounded by family members.

'Stephanie inconsolable - her world has fallen apart,' said one family member. 'What has happened is absolutely horrific.'

Ms
Morlet was badly beaten up by Stevenson in 2005 and 2010, when an order
was made preventing Stevenson seeing the children without a third party
adult being present.

Tragic: The children both allegedly became victims of a bitter custody battle between their English father and French mother

The 
2010 order was said to have been reversed over the past few weeks, 
meaning Stevenson was allowed to have the children to stay on Friday 
night for the first time in three years.

Stevenson
has been formally placed under criminal investigation for the double, 
and is likely to be remanded in custody until his murder trial.

Another
judicial source said: 'We are presently holding back from the charge of
premeditated murder but this could always change.'

The source said all the circumstances surrounding the horrific crime would be investigated over many months.

Neighbours
of the Stevenson said he had appeared 'calm and relaxed' as he wandered
around the St Priest suburb of Lyon, where he lives, with the two 
children on Saturday morning.

'It
was a warm day and he was in T-shirt and long shorts,' said one. 'The 
children were smiling happily, and appeared to be enjoying a day out 
with their dad.

'He was buying them little presents, including sweets, and did not appear in the least bit flustered.'

When
Mrs Stevenson, an accountant's assistant, returned to pick up the 
children from the second floor apartment at around 5pm on Saturday she 
saw Stevenson looking 'panicked and angry', according to a neighbour.

'He
was in the stairwell of the block, and his clothes were covered in 
blood,' said the neighbour. 'He made off on a pair of roller-skates, 
leaving his car in the apartment block's garage.'

The block of flats where Julian Stevenson lived

Following a short manhunt, Stevenson was found in Lyon's 8th arrondissement at around 8pm on the same evening.

A judicial source said that a knife which was thought to be the murder weapon had been found in the flat.

The
source said the double murder was 'clearly linked to a painful 
separation' and 'legal procedures concerning the right to access to the 
children which the father deemed insufficient.'

Stevenson
has been living in France for 10 years and married in 2005. His wife 
was finally heard by prosecutors on Sunday, providing them with their 
details of her troubled relationship with her ex-husband.

Investigators were particularly keen to know who gave the father legal authority to look after the children.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
