Schapelle Corby's siblings will be awarded over $300,000 as part of their defamation court case against the author and publisher of Sins Of The Father.

Publishing company Allen and Unwin reached a settlement with the Corby family, Fairfax reports, in which Mercedes Corby will be awarded $175,000 and her brother Michael Corby junior will receive $150,000.

The book, which was written by journalist Eamonn Duff and released in 2011, delves into the life of Schapelle and her family, including her father who died of cancer.

It's defamatory claims included that family members including their deceased father were involved in drug smuggling and that Schapelle's conviction benefited the family financially.

Mercedes released a statement after the settlement was reached, in which she said 'This book was riddled with incorrect facts about my family — facts that could have been easily checked but were not.'

'Had my father been alive, this book would never have been published. There is no legal avenue for the family of a dead person who has been defamed to vindicate their loved-one's reputation.

'My father was a good man who worked hard in the mines most of his adult life before succumbing to cancer. The allegations made about him in this book are false and were devastating to his family. 

The Corby family's took legal action against the book Sins Of The Father which claimed Schapelle's father (pictured) participated in activities involving drugs

The book was also found to have breached copyright laws by using five family photographs of Corby

'We are fortunate that we could do something about this book — and are happy today that Allen & Unwin and Mr Duff have had to pay for what they said about our family.'

Damages were also paid earlier in the year for the use of five family photographs of Schapelle which were ruled a breach of copyright, while four of those were found to have infringed a 'moral right of attribution'.

According to Fairfax, the pictures showed Shapelle as a child, with her father, in jail with her mother, with a drug dealer in Bali and at the airport before jetting off to Bali.

Although four out of five photographs were given to various photographers and journalists by the Corby's themselves, the family members claimed they did not intend for them to be used for Mr Duff's purpose.
