Should the day ever come when the dead do rise from their graves a new disaster preparedness kit could give you an edge in those chaotic first hours for the reasonable cost of $1,499.

Called the First 24, the 12'' by 9'' waterproof and dust tight kit includes a revolver, flashlight, emergency signals, fire starter, compass, 550 Para cord, batteries, and a battery caddy. 

To ensure that all of this stays in good condition while on the run from the ravenous hordes, the case is also resistant to UV, solvents, corrosion and fungus.

The First 24 kit holds a revolver, flashlight, emergency signals, fire starter, compass, 550 Para cord, batteries, and a battery caddy

The kit's gun can take ammo for short and long-range targets ensuring you get the drop on the living dead

Fox News reports that Taurus International Manufacturing Inc. is selling the kit with the promise that 'Having the right gear at your finger tips can ensure a positive outcome to a life-threatening crisis.'

The revolver, dubbed the 'Taurus Judge' by the company, a three inch barrel gun that can take both 45 Colt ammo for long distances and .410 2-1/2'' shotshells for close-range targets. 

Buyers can customize it with fiber optic front sights, fixed rear sights, and a rubber grip. 

As for the knife, it is a fixed blade tactical knife with two edges made of what the company calls a 'nearly indestructible form' of carbon steel.

And with power grids likely failing along with the rest of society, it's a good thing that the case include a Brite Strike EPLI flashlight, the same model that won the NRA's 2013 American Hunter Gear of the Year award. 

Assuming you get into a situation where rescue might be possible, there are also plenty of emergency signals. 

The Taurus company notes that being prepared can make the difference between life or death in the first hours of a national disaster

The entire kit is built to be waterproof and withstand shocks so it stays together on the run through chaos

The kit's All Purpose Adhesive Light Strips, also from Brite Strike, can be seen for up to a mile and can be set to fast strobe, slow strobe, and steady.

The lights are also waterproof, dustrproof, and shockproof just like the case. 

For absolute basic survival needs a good fire starter is a must, and Taurus covers that with a Emergency Fire Starter Kit from Zippo that contains a flint wheel ignition to light up water-resistant Waxed Tinder Sticks. 

A 550 Para cord, the same kind of nylon rope used in World War II parachute suspension lines, rounds out the kit and could have multiple applications.

While these items will no doubt be helpful anywhere, a new study suggests you'd be best off having them in the hills.  

Researchers from Cornell University Alexander Alemi, Matthew Bierbaum, Christopher Myers and James Sethna used an approach for modelling disease to work out how an actual outbreak might play out.

New research suggests the kit might be most effective if you're already safely hidden in the mountains

'Modeling zombies takes you through a lot of the techniques used to model real diseases, albeit in a fun context,' said researcher Alexander Alemi

They found that cities would fall quickly, but it would take weeks for zombies to penetrate into less densely populated areas, and months to reach northern parts of the mountain-time zone.

Their advice is to head for the Rockies.

The research involved results from simulations the researchers wrote themselves, similar to modelling chemical reactions.

Also in the kit is an emergency light, compass, fire starter, and knife

'Modeling zombies takes you through a lot of the techniques used to model real diseases, albeit in a fun context,' Alemi told phys.org. 

There are four states a person can be in (human, infected, zombie, dead zombie), and these are dependent on possible interactions (zombie bites human, human kills zombie, zombie moves etc).

'Given the dynamics of the disease, once the zombies invade more sparsely populated areas, the whole outbreak slows down - there are fewer humans to bite, so you start creating zombies at a slower rate,' says Alemi.

'I'd love to see a fictional account where most of New York City falls in a day, but upstate New York has a month or so to prepare.'

The researchers aim to add more complicated social variables to their simulation such as awareness of the outbreak and ability to make a run for it.

The group were inspired by graduate statistical mechanics class and by reading 'World War Z: an oral history of the first zombie war' by Max Brooks.

Characters on 'The Walking Dead' have tried several different hide outs from the zombie apocalypse, including a remote farm and a prison, but researchers at Cornell think they have found the ideal place to go

Indeed the conclusions of their research match up with some of the plot points of the book, which sees the U.S. abandon two-thirds of the country and retreat behind the Rockies to regroup before launching a counterattack.

The Cornell team are less optimistic about our prospects.

The abstract for their research ends with the line: 'We build up to a full scale simulation of an outbreak in the United States, and discover that for "realistic" parameters, we are largely doomed.'

Despite this, since 2011 the Center for Disease Control and Prevention has playfully used a zombie apocalypse as a learning tool for teaching emergency preparedness.

The group presents its findings during the 2015 American Physical Society March Meeting, on Thursday, March 5 in San Antonio, Texas.

With fewer humans to bite you, rural areas create zombies at a much slower rate

However they conclude that using realistic parameters in their simulation 'we are largely doomed'
