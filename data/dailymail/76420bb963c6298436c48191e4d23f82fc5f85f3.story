Paul Casey hit a blistering nine under par 63 to move into contention at the BMW International Open at Gut Larchenhof, near Cologne —  24 hours after he seemed out of the tournament.

Casey fired in nine birdies, including four in a row from the ninth, to move to 13 under par after three rounds.

He ended the day tied for ninth, four shots off leader Pablo Larrazabal.

Hopeful: Casey says the weather has helped as the 'rain has softened it up' on the green near Cologne

Casey said: ‘I’m glad I got off early, The course is absolutely perfect. The rain has softened it up and the flags are there to be shot at.’

The former Ryder Cup star was doubly relieved to shoot his best round of the year after fearing he’d missed the cut on Friday.

Casey had stood on the tee at the par-four 18th knowing he needed a birdie to scrape in, and he said: ‘I thought I’d blown it. But I hit a beautiful drive and a gap wedge to two feet.’

Even then he was made to wait to clinch his weekend playing rights due to lightning in the air.

‘It was nice to go back after the rain delay knowing you only had a short putt left,’ he added.

Branden Grace, meanwhile, fell out of the chase after incurring a two-shot penalty at the second — for putting while his caddie was still holding an umbrella over him.
