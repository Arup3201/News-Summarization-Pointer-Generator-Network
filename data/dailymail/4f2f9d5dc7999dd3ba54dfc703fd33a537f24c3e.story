An expat couldn't bear to miss his Christmas curry - so he shipped it from Britain to France.

Roy Buchan, 63, who emigrated from Hampshire to Normandy with wife Jan ten years ago, stunned staff at The Akash restaurant in Southsea, when he asked for a doggy bag after spending £105 on a meal. 

When they asked where he was off to, Mr Buchan replied, 'Back home to France' - over 300 miles away.

He said: 'We're enjoying life in our Normandy village but we do miss a good curry.

'When we lived in the UK our favourite type of food was always Indian cuisine and, although there are some Indian restaurants in France, the quality of food is nowhere near as good as in England.'

Mr Buchan said when visiting the UK he and his wife 'never miss the opportunity' to have Indian food.

And Christmas is no exception: 'Instead of turkey and all the trimmings, we go for curry.

One of the couple's sons lives in Portsmouth, so Mr Buchan booked an early morning ferry and met him for a pre-Christmas meal. 

Mr Ahmed said the restaurant delivers food to 'all sorts of places and for a variety of occasions', but this was the first time their food had travelled so far

But instead of trying to keep the meal warm, Mr Buchan packed it in a large cool bag for his overnight return trip to Caen. 

He said the food arrived back in France 'without a hitch', and is now sitting in the freezer waiting for Christmas Day. 

Faz Ahmed, who runs The Akash with his dad George and brother Jaf, said the restaurant delivers food to 'all sorts of places and for a variety of occasions', but this was the first time their food had travelled so far.

He said: 'This is the first time we have ever had anyone take their takeaway to another country before - and for Christmas Day as well.'
