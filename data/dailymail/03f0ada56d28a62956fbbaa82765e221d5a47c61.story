Jailed: Youth baseball coach David Scott Engle has been sentenced to 25 years for child pornography

A youth baseball coach who amassed thousands of child pornography images and videos was  sentenced to 25 years in prison on Monday.

David Scott Engle, a divorce lawyer from Lake Lucerne in Washington, will now stand trial on child rape charges after investigators found dozens of videos of him allegedly raping two boys.

The 50-year-old, who was arrested in November after buying child pornography online, also had a collection of 450 images showing the clothed genitals of the boys he coached.

Engle was sentenced on federal child pornography charges but allegations that he raped one boy 'countless' times over six years remaining outstanding in state court.

When police searched his house and a storage unit they found the stash of home-made and bought child pornography, according to the Seattle Post-Intelligencer.

The baseball coach for 11 and 12 year olds had gone to great lengths to have contact with children, and amassed an extensive collection of child pornography featuring boys the same age as the ones he coached, the court was told.

Before his arrest, Engle had coached a youth baseball team, was president of Maple Valley Pony Baseball and Fast Pitch, served on two regional baseball organizations and one baseball business.

Assistant U.S. Attorney Marci Ellsworth said the former coach abused the trust parents placed in him.

'While [Engle] was purportedly serving as a role model and mentor for these young boys, he was sexually interested in them,' Ms Ellsworth said in court papers.

'When [he] was taking pictures and shooting video of baseball games, his camera was focused on the players’ crotches, not on their batting stance, pitching arms, or any other aspect of their athletic performance.'

Engle pleaded guilty in July to federal child pornography charges and admitted possessing hundreds of videos of children being sexually abused.

Now he has been sentenced on those charges, the child rape case can proceed with any state sentence following on from the 25-year term just handed to Engle.

King County prosecutors have charged him with three counts of child rape over allegations that he was shown raping a boy in several videos.

About 1,400 photos and 40 videos allegedly show Engle raping one boy, and three videos show abuse of a second child.

'Betrayal of trust': The court heard the Maple Valley coach went out of his way to have contact with children

In one Engle filmed himself watching baseball on TV as the boy he was raping struggled and told him 'No'. The assaults only stopped after his arrest.

'This
is a heart-wrenching betrayal of trust of the victims and the 
community,' U.S. Attorney Jenny A. Durkan said in a statement.

Engle was caught after postal inspectors joined an international investigation into a website dealing in child pornography.

He spent $2,300 on videos and photos sent to him by the company between 2005 and 2011, according to Q13Fox, but when police raided his home they found child pornography well beyond the purchases he made from the website they had been investigating.

His 'collection of child pornography consisted predominantly of young boys in the same age range as those [he] coached in youth baseball,' Ms Ellsworth told the court.

She added: '[Engle] had many pictured of the boys he coached – including nearly 450 pictures of their clothed genital regions – which, although … not pornographic in nature, are nonetheless disturbing.'
