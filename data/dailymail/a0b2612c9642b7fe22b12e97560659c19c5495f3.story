Sixty per cent of Americans still favour capital punishment for convicted murderers, a poll has shown.

The survey demonstrates a clear majority for the ultimate punishment,Â  although it is the lowest percentage since 1972, according to a Gallup poll released yesterday.

At its peak in the mid-1990s, capital punishment support was at 80 per cent, the polling group said.

'The current era of lower support may be tied to death penalty moratoriums in several states beginning around 2000 after several death-row inmates were later proven innocent of the crimes of which they were convicted,' Gallup said.

Since 2006, six states have repealed death penalty laws outright, including Maryland this year, Gallup said.

Eighty-one per cent of Republicans, 47 per cent of Democrats and 60 per cent of independents support the death penalty, according to the poll.

The largest decrease was found among Democrats, 75 per cent of whom supported the death penalty in 1994.

Gallup has been measuring Americans' attitudes about capital punishment since 1936. Fifty-seven per cent were in favor of the death penalty in November 1972.

The US Supreme Court reinstated capital punishment in 1976.

Support for the death penalty increased from 1976 and reached a peak in 1994, when Americans named crime as the biggest problem plaguing the nation, the report said.

Gallop randomly sampled 1,028 people by telephone in all 50 US states and the District of Columbia from Oct. 3 to 6. The margin of error was plus or minus 4 percentage points, Gallup said.
