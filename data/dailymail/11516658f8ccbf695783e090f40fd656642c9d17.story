Hero: Watersports instructor Charlie Toogood is believed to have brought a runaway speedboat under control in Padstow

A sports instructor who risked his life by leaping on to the out-of- control speedboat was hailed a hero yesterday.

Charlie Toogood and a friend sped to the rescue in another boat after seeing the Milligan family in the sea.

They drew level with the stricken vessel as it raced round in circles, allowing Mr Toogood to jump into it.

He then managed to kill the engine and halt the boat. 

Police and coastguards yesterday praised Mr Toogood’s ‘incredible seamanship and bravery’ which prevented further tragedy during the horrifying accident.

His actions are credited with saving the lives of Nick Milligan’s wife Victoria and daughters Amber, 12, and Olivia, ten, and son Kit, four.

Matt Pavitt, from the North Cornwall Coastguard, said: ‘He managed to manoeuvre his boat alongside the vessel which was going round and round in circles, picked his moment and jumped.’

Mr Pavitt said two kayakers and at least three other pleasure boats went to the aid of the family ‘within minutes’ of the disaster.

He added: ‘One of the kayakers actually managed to manoeuvre in between the boat while it was still circling to provide aid to some people incredibly quickly.’ 

Detective Superintendent Jim Colwell said: ‘Without the brave and heroic efforts of local people and holidaymakers in the minutes immediately after this incident in assisting the family while they were in the water, I’m confident that this would have been far worse in terms of the overall death toll.’ 

Mr Toogood, a married father in his early 30s, declined to talk about his heroics last night. His mother Sarah said he was ‘in a bit of a state’.

Another friend added: ‘He is devastated. Everyone is rightly calling  him a hero, but he felt he was helpless that he couldn’t do more to save the others.’ 

Teenager Will Jones was named as the helmsman of Mr Toogood’s boat. His sister Amy said: ‘My brother is still very shaken up from it all.’

Hundreds
of holidaymakers watched in horror as the speedboat then raced round in
circles, its propeller slashing the helpless victims and turning the 
water 'red with blood'.

Mr Jones, 19, later wrote on Facebook: 'After today the next few days are going to be very difficult to process. Thoughts are with those who are involved in the accident.'

Experienced: Mr Toogood runs his own business hiring out boats to holidaymakers in Cornwall

Maria Chase wrote on Facebook: 'We 
were down in Padstow today and saw the tragedy and saw a hero who saved 
more lives by jumping on to an out-of-control speedboat from another 
boat.

'He deserves a medal, whoever he was.'

Another, Charlotte Jacobs, wrote to 
the RNLI on Twitter: 'We witnessed incredible bravery in Padstow today 
during the tragic accident that unfolded. The men involved deserve 
medals.'

Mr Toogood, is a married father of a five-month-old daughter, runs the Camel Ski School, 
which rents out equipment for holidaymakers as well as offering 
activities such as water-skiing.

He has given a statement to police, but has not spoken publicly about his role in the tragic incident.

His mother Sarah told the Daily Telegraph that her son was 'in a bit of a state' after the accident, and was too traumatised to speak about his actions.

'It's wonderful that his actions have been praised but it was an awful tragedy,' she said.

Tragedy: The Milligan family, with father Nick holding eight-year-old Emily, left, both of whom lost their lives in the speedboat crash in Padstow yesterday

Aftermath: An amateur video showing the empty speedboat out of control at Padstow shortly after the fatal incident

Danger: The boat was completely out of control following the incident in Padstow, Cornwall, on Bank Holiday Sunday

Bravery: The video, filmed from the shore, shows Mr Toogood jumping on to the speedboat

‘Brave
man, Charlie Toogood,’ one admirer wrote on Twitter. ‘Respect to 
Charlie Toogood who leapt aboard that out-of-control speedboat to cut 
the engine. He deserves a George Medal.’

Dog walker Simon Lewins, from Wadebridge, was around 100 yards from the speedboat as it circled in the water.

He said: ‘We saw a boat coming up the
estuary and it seemed to take a right turn. As it took the turn it 
flopped and the people in the boat went out in the water and then the 
boat went round in circles and it seemed to come back into the group on 
three or four occasions.

‘We heard screaming and saw seagulls 
coming into the water, it wasn’t good. As this happens the boat was 
taking ever-decreasing circles with nobody in it because they were all 
in the water and it was slowing and it kept going for 10, 15 minutes.’

Mr Lewins, who was speaking on BBC Radio 5 Live, added that he saw Mr Toogood jump into the boat and quickly bring it to a stop.

‘I’ve seen some things but that guy in there deserves a medal for what he did,’ he added.

Mr Pavitt said: 'Thanks to some 
incredible seamanship and bravery from some locals, they managed to get 
the boat under control and stop it from causing any further damage or 
harm.

'From there we were able to locate, 
recover the various people with injuries working with our colleagues 
from the ambulance service, Navy and RAF helicopters, two lifeboats and 
three coastguard teams.'

The coastguard official told BBC Breakfast: 'This boat is eight metres long with a very, very powerful engine on the back.

'It
is going round and round in circles and one of the local boatmen, we 
understand, was able to get alongside it and somebody actually jumped 
from one boat to the other to bring the boat under control. So 
incredible bravery which undoubtedly saved lives.'

Padstow
harbourmaster Rob Atkinson added: 'There was plenty of scope for it to 
go wrong. Had he not got it under control who knows what would have 
happened. He deserves great credit for that. He risked his own life.'

Mr Milligan, 51, and Emily were killed after being thrown from the speedboat and subsequently run over, while wife Victoria, 39, is currently in hospital with children Amber, 12, Olivia, 10, and four-year-old Kit.
