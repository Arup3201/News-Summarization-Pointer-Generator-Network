Manchester United legend Sir Alex Ferguson's memoir, My Autobiography, has become the fastest-selling non-fiction book since records began.

Sir Alex Ferguson's explosive autobiography was released last week, looking back on his three decades in management.

The most successful manager in the history of British football's £25 hardback autobiography sold 115,547 copies in the UK last week - the biggest first-week sale of a non-fiction book since records began in 1998.

Ferguson beats previous record-holder Delia Smith, whose How To Cook: Book Two sold 112,000 copies in its first week on sale in December 1999, reports The Bookseller.

Sales will have been boosted by the uncompromising and candid nature of the firebrand manager.

He has blasted a number of former players, including Roy Keane and David Beckham, who Ferguson claims his love for his pop star wife Victoria stopped him from reaching greater heights in his football career.

‘The big problem for me is that he fell in love with Victoria - that changed everything,’ he wrote.

He also writes of the ‘relief’ that was felt in the dressing room when former skipper Roy Keane, who had ‘the most savage tongue’ left the club in a blaze of controversy in 2005.

According
to Ferguson, the physio would ask what sort of mood Keane was in that 
day ‘because it would affect whole dressing room’.

‘That was how 
influential he was in our daily lives’.

Ferguson's My Autobiography has trounced previous fast-selling memoirs, including former Prime Minister Tony Blair, whose A Journey sold 92,000 copies in its first week in September 2010.

It also beat fellow former Manchester United hero David Beckham, whose My Side sold 86,000 in September 2003, as well as Princess Diana's former butler Paul Burrell's A Royal Duty, which shifted 77,000 in its opening week in October the same year.

In total, £1.4m was spent on copies of Ferguson's memoir last week - almost five pence in every pound spent on all books sold.

My Autobiography comfortably tops this week's Official UK Top 50, ahead of former number one Morrissey's Autobiography (26,248 copies sold) and David Walliams' Demon Dentist (25,808 copies sold). Completing the top five are actor David Jason's memoir, My Life, and Helen Fielding's Bridget Jones follow-up Mad About the Boy.
