Mark Clattenburg must wait until 4pm on Monday, when the list of referees for next week’s round of Premier League fixtures is published, to learn if his ban will extend beyond one match this weekend.

But Clattenburg’s upset over any further suspension will be heightened because he personally informed his employers, the Professional Game Match Officials, about the telephone conversation with Crystal Palace manager Neil Warnock that broke refereeing protocol.

The 39-year-old referee, having already breached regulations by leaving The Hawthorns after West Brom’s 2-2 draw with Palace in his own car without his assistants so that he could get to an Ed Sheeran concert, should not have conversed with Warnock — and may be in further trouble for doing so.

Neil Warnock has been given no punishment for the conversation between him and Clattenburg

But it is another example of football’s double standards that Warnock, who is understood to have made the call to Clattenburg, faces no sanction for doing so. The FA would only act if there was any suggestion of impropriety in their conversation.

BT Sport, who launched in 2013 with a firm intention of knocking Sky Sports off their perch, now seem to have lowered their ambitions. 

Tony Chanmugam, chief financial officer at BT, told American cable business channel CNBC that BT did not need to own the sports TV market and would rather be a ‘strong No 2’. 

Chanmugam added: ‘There’s plenty of space for both of us to survive and survive well.’

It did not go unnoticed at the Women’s Sport Conference hosted by Minister for Sport Helen Grant at Lord’s on Thursday that this initiative to promote female involvement in sport took place on the same day that a Northumberland County FA buffoon was quoted as saying: ‘A woman’s place is in the kitchen and not on a football field. All the time I’m alive, a woman will never referee in my league.’

Grant said of county vice-president John Cummings’s views that have led to a four-month ban: ‘His comments are deplorable and the FA were right to take strong action.

‘At a time when there is so much good work going on to raise the profile of women in sport and encourage more women to get involved, it is extremely disappointing to hear about such sexist remarks.’

Helen Grant, Minister for Sport, described a Northumberland County FA official's comments as 'deplorable'

The £10million cost of Sport England’s campaign to increase women’s participation in sport has caused some concern among governing bodies. 

Yet Sport England have gone ahead with hiring an expensive PR agency, Blue Rubicon, to promote the initiative, saying it was too big a project to be handled in-house.

Stuart goes clubbing

England rugby coach Stuart Lancaster’s desire to connect his international players with their grassroots beginnings — the ‘journey’ is a favourite Lancaster buzzword — has resulted in six of his squad presenting plaques this week to their first clubs.

Richard Wigglesworth was one of the players whose previous clubs were invited to watch England train

So ‘unsung heroes’ from Warlingham (Chris Robshaw), Fylde (Kieran Brookes and Richard Wigglesworth), Salisbury (Mike Brown), Dursley (Ben Morgan) and Westoe (David Wilson) watched England train before meeting Lancaster and being presented with commemorative signs by their old boys.

Meanwhile, the RFU are ramping up their communications army ahead of World Cup year — they had six PR operatives at Lancaster’s first briefing of the autumn international series as well as extra media personnel from Bath and the Ministry of Defence.

A senior civil engineer involved in Olympic Park construction has cast doubt on whether the highly complex stadium roof, the biggest of its kind in the world and already subject to £39m worth of unforeseen extra costs, will be completed in time for a safety certificate to be issued to host five Rugby World Cup matches next autumn. 

The Olympic Stadium's reconstruction might not be ready in time for next year's Rugby World Cup

But the London Legacy Development Company insist the roof will be finished on schedule for a Diamond League athletics meeting ahead of the RWC. 

And contingency plans for a harsh winter include stopping roof work — which doesn’t need to be fully completed until West Ham arrive in 2016 — whenever necessary.
