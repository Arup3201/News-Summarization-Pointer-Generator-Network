A Parish councillor has been suspended in a quiet picturesque village for swearing and threatening a man during a furious row over a tombola draw.

Tempers boiled over in the historic and beautiful village of Long Melford, Suffolk, when councillor Richard Michette, 66, objected to criticism of his wife's handling of the draw.

Richard Roper, a member of the public, had made a statement at a public meeting criticising Mrs Michette for her part organising Long Melford's street fair.

And faced with the verbal assault on his wife's ability to run the historic fair, Mr Michette raged during the council meeting: 'One more word from you and I will thump you.'

In dramatic scenes at odds with the usual sedate pace of village council meetings, Mr Michette also branded Mr Roper a 'little s***', before threatening legal action against him.

The unprecedented ugly scenes saw Mr Michette suspended from the 120-year-old Long Melford Parish Council for swearing at and threatening Mr Roper.

The spat began when prizes donated to the Long Melford raffle by village businesses were allegedly offered at the tombola instead.

Mr Roper also used his chance to make a statement at the meeting to vent his anger at supposed errors with the raffle and tombola prizes.

Mrs Michette's husband Richard, a local optician who has lived in the village for 30 years and a parish councillor for 25 years, lost his cool over what he regarded as unfounded criticism.

He stood up and described Mr Roper as 'a little s***', before adding: 'Shut your mouth.... One more word from you and I will thump you now.'

Mr Michette, who is also trustee and 
secretary of The Friends of Long Melford Church, also warned Mr Roper: 
'You will be hearing from my solicitor'.

The
outburst led to him being suspended for six weeks form his role as a 
councillor by the Babergh District Council and Mid Suffolk Council joint
standards committee.

Cllr Michette has sat on the authority for 30 years while his wife joined last May.

Last night Mr Michette said: 'I lost my temper and - under severe provocation - called him a 'little s**t'.

'Following the meeting I wrote to him and apologised and he accepted my apology.'

Mrs
Michette said her husband was simply doing what anyone would have done 
in the circumstances if their partner was criticised in public.

She said: 'It's been very stressful. We are not going to stand down.

'We have been voted in by lots of people and I am a bit vocal and stand up for things - sometimes that goes against you.'

Mr Michette's outburst was so shocking that another member of the public at the meeting complained to Babergh District Council about the 66-year-old's behaviour.

A hearing was held in February following an investigation.

Long-standing: Mr Michette, who has stood on the local authority for 30 years, has been suspended for six weeks following the outburst

The sub-committee concluded that Mr Michette had failed to treat Mr Roper with respect, contrary to the code of conduct and had brought the office of councillor and the parish council into disrepute.

The members found his conduct was 'threatening, unreasonable and demeaning' to Mr Roper and was a clear, serious breach.

Long Melford attracts thousands of visitors and holidaymakers from all over the UK as well as worldwide every year.

Built on the booming woollen industry of the Middle Ages, the village website claims the first people settled there back in 8300BC.
