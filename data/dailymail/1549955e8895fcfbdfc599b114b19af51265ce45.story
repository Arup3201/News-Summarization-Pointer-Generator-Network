At first glance this Fiat 500 just looks but a bit wobbly.

But this car is more likely than most to get engines revving as it is actually a pile of carefully-painted naked models.

More than a dozen female circus performers, models and contortionists were painstakingly covered from head to toe in bodypaint by New Orleans artist Craig Tracy.

Illusion: This Fiat 500 car is made from a carefully-positioned pile of painted nude models

Lifelike: Models, circus performers and contortionists were coated from head to toe in skin-safe paint

They then arranged themselves into place to form the image of a car, which was photographed by photographer R. J. Muna.

It took 30 to 40 people five days of working in a San Francisco studio to create the perfect image.

The design forms part of an advertising campaign to promote a new Fiat 500 range.

Mr Tracy said: 'Initially the concept for this project blew my mind a bit.

'I knew how overwhelming the task could be but I felt confident with the right supporting staff and crew that we'd get it done

Hard work: It took five days of preparation to secure the perfect image

Practice: The models had to hold their poses for hours while they were photographed so artist Craig Tracy knew where to paint them

Contorted: The painted models had to work together to form the shape of the car

'The process involving this was many days of preparation, pre organising
the poses, mapping everything that would eventually come to be real and
then working really long days to make them happen.

'This project was certainly more than the typical ad, it became a work of art.'

The artist uses paint designed for safe use on human skin and has painted around 400 people in his career.

The
Fiat 500 image appeared in the Body Issue of ESPN's magazine. The issue
has caused controversy as it features devout Catholic tennis player 
Agnieszka Radwanska on the front cover.

Getting ready: A model is painted to resemble the headlight of a Fiat 500

New range: The Abarth logo is painted onto a model

Talented: Artist Craig Tracy specialises in painting people and uses a paint that is safe for human skin

Incredible: The models were painted in painstaking detail
