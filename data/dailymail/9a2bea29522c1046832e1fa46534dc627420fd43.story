When you’re one of four quadruplets, you soon have to get used to sharing everything with your siblings, from birthdays to your favourite cuddly toy.

And now 10million-to-one quads Heidi, Annabelle, Hannah and Jessica Kelly are about to begin their biggest shared adventure yet – starting school.

Two days ago a large parcel arrived at the Kelly household containing four matching sets of school uniform - smart grey pinafores, white shirts, red satchels and red cardigans.

All kitted out: Annabelle, Jessica, Hannah and Heidi Kelly, from Billingham, Cleveland, were the first quads born in Britain as two sets of identical twins

A large parcel containing the four matching sets of school uniform arrived at the girls' home two days ago - and they could not wait to try them on

The four-year-old sisters, who in 2009 became the first double set of identical twins to be born in Britain thanks to IVF, couldn’t wait to try on their outfits – and now they are eagerly counting down to the start of term.

Their mother Lisa, 38, from Billingham in County Durham, said: ‘Seeing them in uniforms makes them seem so grown up. I know I will shed a tear when I wave them off on their first day.’

She added: ‘Some children might be nervous starting school. But when you’re quads you’ve always got someone to lean on. You’re never on your own.’

The mum of five, who with husband Sean, 39,  an electrical designer,  also has older son Cameron, 13, admits teachers might have a difficult time telling the girls apart.

She says: ‘The girls went to the nursery attached to the school so they are known to many of the staff.

'But to help teachers who don’t know them, I plan to put hair ties with different coloured bobbles in the girls’ hair – with blue for twins Jessica and Hannah and red for twins Heidi and Annabelle.’

However, Mrs Kelly says her daughters have all developed their own style and while initially people are confused they soon realise each one is very much an individual.

‘Heidi is a real tomboy,’ she says, ‘but Annabelle is a true girl who adores her dollies, Jessica is a live wire who’s always up to mischief while Hannah is much quieter.’

Each set of twins shares a bedroom at the couple’s four bed-detached house in Billingham, Cleveland.

But says Mrs Kelly: 'They are so close that even now they still adore to snuggle up together and we always find they’ve crept into one another’s beds in the morning.’

The youngsters created a sensation when they were born on December 27, 2009.

The 10 million to one quads were the first born in Britain who are two sets of identical twins. They are the miracle children the Kellys never thought they’d have.

Originally the couple simply wanted a sibling for their son Cameron.

But after failing to conceive naturally a second time they spent £9,000 on IVF and to their delight found they were expecting quads after the third attempt.

The girls, pictured here shortly before their second birthday, might look identical but their mother said they have all developed their own individual style and personalities

The girls – the result of two fertilised embryos put back into the uterus that both grew into two sets of identical twins – were born healthy at 31.5 weeks after a problem free pregnancy.

Twins Heidi and Annabelle both weighed 3Ib 3oz while Hannah and Jessica were 2Ib 10oz and 2Ib 11oz .

Recalls Mrs Kelly, who took a career break to raise her family but plans to return to work as a nurse in the autumn: ‘Overnight our lives changed and for a while it was chaos.

'We went through two washing machines and tumble dryers in two years and ended up doing what used to be a family grocery shop once a week, every other day.

‘As they’ve grown up everything has had to be done in fours. Four sets of clothes, four matching toy pushchairs, four identical scooters – Christmas and birthdays take lots of planning.

‘But we’ve always felt extraordinarily lucky to have a big family. Even now the girls still attract attention - people still stop us when we’re out say how beautiful they are.’

Meanwhile she believes having the four together is a blessing.

‘When they were tiny babies and then wilful toddlers life was tiring but now they’re older they get on so well and there is always someone to play with.

‘Some children might be nervous starting full time school for the first time. But when you’re one of quads you’ve always got someone to lean on. You’re never on your own.’
