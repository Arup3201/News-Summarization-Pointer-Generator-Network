New secret files from the heart of Colonel Gaddafi's government have revealed the paranoid final few months of his violent and oppressive 42-year regime.

The hundreds of intelligence documents left behind by his fleeing staff include a written pledge by one spy to poison rebel leaders' food and water to help him cling onto power.

As the revolution grew against Gaddafi more and more secret files from his intelligence service flowed back to Tripoli.

These phone tap records and 
dispatches from domestic agents claim that al-Qaida was behind the 
rebellion and that 4,000 U.S. troops were about to invade from Egypt.

Gaddafi even drafted a letter of Barack Obama saying he should support Libya to stop terrorists taking over.

They also said rebels carried Viagra and
condoms into battle so they could rape women and told Gaddafi and his 
family to use their mobile phones for only three minutes at a time.

Military leaders in the western mountains
were disregarding orders and troops in the city of Misrata ran out of 
ammunition saying the situation had descended into 'every man for 
himself,' reports also showed.

One of the handwritten intelligence reports, written by a man who said he had 'infiltrated' the rebel council, gave the names of five members, their background and the hotels they frequented.

The note concluded with an offer to kill the council members.

'I can carry out any suicide operation I'm given to assassinate members of the council or poison their food and water,' it says.

The author is not identified and no council members have been killed by Gaddafi's regime.

The reports, going back to the start of the rebellion in February, grew more desperate as the Libyan rebellion veered into civil war.

One document discovered was a draft letter from Gaddafi to President Barack Obama.

'It is necessary to support Libya to 
get rid of the armed men of al-Qaida before all of north Africa falls 
into the hands of bin Laden,' it said. It is unclear if the letter was 
ever sent.

The documents refer to the rebels as 'insurgents,' 'saboteurs' 'armed gangs' and 'rats.'

Reports
from across Libya detail the government's actions to erase opposition 
symbols, such as replacing rebel flags with the green banners of the 
Gaddafi regime or painting over rebel graffiti.

The reports also showed how the regime was quick to believe its own disinformation. In one conversation log, an Egyptian man said 4,000 U.S. troops were in Cairo, waiting to enter Libya by land.

Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi received hundreds of security reports, many of which showed how his control of the country was collapsing

'Four thousand, some of them commandos,' the Egyptian said. 'It's unbelievable.'

There were signs of paranoia. In one log, a man with a Gulf Arab accent advised that Gaddafi, his sons and associates 'use their cellphone for no more than three minutes,' out of fear that they, too, were being intercepted.

In April and May, bleak reports flowed back from the front lines.

A May 5 report depicted chaos in the ranks, saying soldiers often ran out of ammunition before reaching the battlefield, leading many to be killed or captured.

'The rest fled randomly in all directions,' the report said, citing the 'lack of leaders for members of the armed forces on site (every man for himself).'

Later reports suggested threats inside Tripoli from regime opponents and one contained two handwritten letters, threatening to kill security forces.

'We will take mercy on no one, regardless of his position, and will kill anyone manning a checkpoint,' one read. Next to a hand-drawn rebel flag, red ink declared, 'You have been warned.'

At the centre of the situation was Gaddafi's intelligence chief Abdullah al-Senoussi, whose well-fortified compound received reports from around the country.

One letter from the Investigation and Surveillance Office pleaded with al-Senoussi to intervene at a site which 'has become an office of alcohol, prostitution and theft of property of those arrested.'

In the next four pages, the officer accused his boss of getting drunk on the job, stealing money from prisoners and seizing cars to give to his guards, sons and favorite prostitutes.

Jubilation amongst rebel fighters today, but many were being tracked by Gaddafi's security forces files have shown

He said his superior drugged an Egyptian woman and tried to rape her before an aide intervened, and later 'sentenced' three of his officers to death.

'This order caused some confusion among those in the office,' he noted.

A ragged band of mountain rebels now handles security at al-Senoussi's compound, parking their truck under the intelligence services' motto: 'The weapons are in the people's hands.'

Inside, the fighters lounge in chairs and casually flip through the hundreds of documents strewn on the floor.

Among them is an order from al-Senoussi that was not carried out before he fled.

'In the crucial last moments, get rid of the contents of the administration and its secret documents by burning or destroying them,' it said.
