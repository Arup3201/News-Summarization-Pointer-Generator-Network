The pain goes on for England. This was the game they knew they needed to win, but instead it ended with a fifth successive defeat and the prospect of a demoralising autumn campaign.

After last week’s fourth straight loss to world champions New Zealand, Stuart Lancaster’s national team were well aware of the urgent need for a result to ease growing pressure. Instead, they were beaten at home once more and their long wait for a victory over South Africa – a feat last achieved in 2006 – goes on.

This was a shattering outcome and will leave England to clutch at straws again. 

Elements of their performance were impressive – particularly their driving maul which yielded two tries, their scrum and the exploits of their ball-carrying No 8s; first Billy Vunipola and then Ben Morgan. Mike Brown also made regular in-roads from full-back.

But these are crumbs of comfort. The result was everything and it eluded them. Just 10 months from now, England will go into a home World Cup and their ambition was to have turned Twickenham into a ‘fortress’ by then. Instead, it is a venue where the southern giants do not arrive with trepidation.

While a selection reshuffle and a game against Samoa next week may generate much-needed hope and confidence, the key pointers are the Tests against the SANZAR countries and England are struggling against them. The showdown with Australia on November 29 now looms as a fixture of colossal significance. Lose that one and this will have been a disastrous November series.

England had been anticipating good weather for this match, but in fact there was a long spell of pre-match rain which made conditions difficult for handling. There was moisture in the air and also on the emotional face of Billy Vunipola. The Saracens No 8 was in tears during the anthem – signifying the importance of this game to him personally and to the home team as a whole.

Lancaster’s men had much to improve from last week, but they made a dazzling start against the All Blacks and they were similarly dynamic from the off this time. An early lineout catch and drive allowed Danny Care and Owen Farrell to release Kyle Eastmond, who made a nimble half-break, only to knock on in the tackle.

Farrell was another of the England players who needed to raise his game after an off-colour display against New Zealand. However, the fly-half left his team scrambling desperately in the 10th minute when he attempted to counter-attack from his own 22 and release Anthony Watson, but the Springboks flooded the ruck, won turn-over ball and so nearly scored a try in the left corner.

As it was, they were awarded a penalty which Patrick Lambie kicked for a 3-0 lead. Shortly afterwards, the visitors surged further ahead as Care suffered a calamity on his 50th Test appearance. England were patiently probing in the opposition half when the scrum-half had a pass intercepted by Jan Serfontein, who raced clear to score at the posts and Lambie converted.

A 10-point deficit represented an English crisis and Mike Brown responded in fine style, with a scorching midfield break from a high kick, but he was stopped by Cobus Reinach on the Boks’ 22 and the move broke down. Then in the 24th minute, England should have had hit back with a try, only to fluff their opportunity.

Danny Care seized on a ruck turn-over and broke to the right and the ball was worked to Dave Attwood who galloped clear. But the big Bath lock didn’t release Watson when he had a clear run to the line and by the time he took a tackle and off-loaded, the space had been closed up. Jonny May went close on the other flank, but a glorious opening had been squandered

For the remainder of the first half, the game became disjointed and attritional, with both captains warned by referee Steve Walsh about deliberately collapsing mauls. 

England had the advantage in the scrum, but they couldn’t make a dent in South Africa’s imperious lineout and the Springboks were causing problems for the hosts at the breakdown.

A penalty by Farrell put his team on the scoreboard and after Lambie had struck back at the other end, the England No 10 added another kick to ensure it was a one-score game going into the break.

Any up-turn in optimism among home supporters was shattered seconds after the re-start, as South Africa conjured a sensational try. As England’s defence came up fast, Lambie’s clever kick over the top was taken by Willie Le Roux and the full back burst into the 22 before a brilliant back-hand off-load sent Cobus Reinach away to touch down. Lambie converted comfortably. 

Three minutes later, just as they were staring down the barrel, England were given renewed hope. Another powerful rolling maul was dragged by down the Boks and Victor Matfield was shown the yellow card. A week earlier, Lancaster’s side had been unable to capitalise when the All Blacks were reduced to 14 men, but this time they rallied strongly. 

Their driving game was causing chaos and from the penalty they kicked to the corner, took the lineout cleanly and the pack surged in-field, forcing David Wilson over for his maiden Test try. Farrell duly added the extras.

The same method created another English try three minutes later, as South Africa’s depleted forwards were marched back through their 22 before Ben Morgan – on for Vunipola – twisted free and pounded through three defenders to score. Again Farrell converted and England were on terms.

Yet, parity was short-lived, as South Africa responded in kind. Their pack had been under the cosh, but they delivered another strong maul from an attacking lineout and Schalk Burger charged down the blindside to strike in the corner. Lambie couldn’t convert from the wide angle, but he added a penalty 13 minutes from time.

By then, England had lost Dylan Hartley to the sin-bin, after the hooker was adjudged to have trampled on Duane Vermeulen at the bottom of a maul. They were also hampered by the fact that Farrell was clearly in pain, but the coaches appeared reluctant to remove him.

Eventually, George Ford was brought on and his 68th-minute penalty put England in range of their rivals, but they kept succumbing to execution errors and disciplinary lapses, and a Lambie drop goal appeared to put the result beyond doubt. In fact, Brad Barritt’s try at the end of a sustained onslaught revived faint hope, but there was no time left for the hosts to snatch the result they so desperately craved.
