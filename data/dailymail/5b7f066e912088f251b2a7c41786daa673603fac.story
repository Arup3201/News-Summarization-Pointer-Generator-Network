Vanessa Feltz, pictured today, said she has received a 'storm of insults and bile' following her allegations she was assaulted by Rolf Harris

Vanessa Feltz says she has received a 'storm of insults and bile' following claims she was sexually assaulted by Rolf Harris.

The broadcaster claimed on Sunday the sex predator put his hands up her dress and tugged at her underwear during a live interview on Channel 4's The Big Breakfast.

Feltz claims she only managed to stop Harris assaulting her by calling out for an advertisement break.

Following her allegations, which date back to 1996, the presenter says that she's received an 'outpouring of misogyny and hatred' online.

Speaking on the radio,  she said: 'You think if people react like that, you can see why people don't come forward.

'I'm 52 and I can handle myself so imagine if I was a seven-year-old child, or 12 or 17.

'I'm not saying just if it's someone famous, but imagine if it was your dad, uncle or teacher.

'The kind of reaction I have had, I found so upsetting.

'I was upset by the outpouring of misogyny and hatred and you know "Who would want to assault Vanessa Feltz?".'

Today, scores of comments could be seen on Twitter.

One, named Jack, said: 'Vanessa Feltz claims Rolf Harris groped her. Surely even Rolf Harris has standards?'

Another, Jo Hoskinson, wrote: 'Apparently #RolfHarris groped #vanessafeltz. Really Vanessa? Does someone need some publicity? #jumponthebandwagon'

One Twitter user, Rob, wrote: 'If #RolfHarris has touched up #vanessafeltz he deserves another 5 years for p***poor taste.'

Another, referred to as Belcher, added: 'Vanessa Feltz, though? You've really let your fans down this time, Rolf.'

Adam Tonner remarked: 'Vanessa Feltz is just a stupid b**** that noone likes #doone'

Miss Feltz said on Sunday it 'didn't occur to her' to inform officers of Harris's alleged attack. Pictured is another of the tweets posted today

Miss Feltz said today she was 'upset' by the messages, one abusive example pictured

Derek Stitt said: 'Vanessa Feltz has accused Rolf Harris of touching her up in 1996. I think he thought he was sedating a hippo in animal hospital to be fair.'

One, known as Fattus Antus, wrote: 'Vanessa Feltz looks like the offspring of a knockoff Barbie doll from Rwanda and a neglected beanbag. I can honestly say that I'd rather grope a Kangaroo than Vanessa Feltz.'

Feltz said that she contacted Metropolitan Police on the first day of the trial hoping to testify against him.

However, she was told that Harris's lawyers said the allegations came too late to investigate without derailing the case.

Earlier this week, singer Linda Nolan also alleged the paedophile molested her when she was 15.

She claims Harris attacked her while she was backstage in South Africa  - where she and her sisters were due to perform.

Harris, 84, was jailed for five years 
and nine months at Southwark Crown Court last Friday for 12 indecent 
assaults on four victims including his daughter’s best friend and an 
eight-year-old.

Feltz says the attack took place in May 1996 while she was interviewing Harris on a bed.

In an interview with The Daily Express, she said some of the staff on the show warned her Harris was known in the business for his wandering hands.

The presenter, who was wearing a floor-length evening dress for the interview, described the alleged attack to the newspaper.

She said: 'As the interview continued, with his wife watching and with the crew all in the room, I suddenly felt a rustling at the hem of my dress.

‘I was on live television so I could not look down but I sensed that his hand was at the bottom of my dress and he was slowly gathering the fabric up and moving his hand higher and higher up my leg.’

She said Harris carried on smiling and joking as though nothing was happening.

‘Suddenly his hand had reached my knee and he was still going up and travelling at speed.

Miss Feltz says she was attacked by the paedophile during this interview on Channel 4's Big Breakfast - which she presented at the time. She said staff warned her at the time Harris had 'wandering hands'

'After a few seconds he had managed to get his hand inside the elastic of my knickers and I was absolutely staggered.

‘I had to do something but I was in the middle of an interview on live television with one of the most famous men in the country. I have not a shadow of a doubt that he knew exactly what he was doing and he was getting excited about it, doing what he was doing while he was on live television.

‘The second we went to the break I jumped away from him and got his hand out from under my dress. He didn’t react in any way at all. When we came back to the live interview he carried on as if nothing had happened.

‘I was powerless to protect myself and he knew and he was getting a thrill from it.

'At the time I did not even consider going to the police. I did not think anyone would believe me against the great Rolf Harris.’
