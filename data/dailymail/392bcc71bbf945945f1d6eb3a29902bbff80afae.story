A toddler has been dubbed the real-life Elsa from the Disney film Frozen because she faces a daily battle to keep warm.

Gracie Hughes, two, suffers from Raynaud's syndrome, and turns blue when she is exposed to the cold. 

The condition occurs when small blood vessels in the extremities are over-sensitive to changes in temperature, interrupting the blood supply.

During an attack, the extremities become first white and dead looking and may then turn blue and finally red and burning when the blood flow is restored.

The condition can cause considerable pain, numbness or tingling.

Two-year-old Gracie Hughes (with her mother Laurie) suffers from Raynaud's syndrome, which means she turns blue when she is exposed to the cold

Raynaud's occurs when small blood vessels in the extremities are over-sensitive to changes in temperature, interrupting the blood supply. Gracie is so badly affected she has been given special gloves for extra protection

Most patients can cope by wrapping up warm, although some develop painful weeping ulcers, which can become infected.

Gracie is so badly affected she has been given special gloves for extra protection.

Her mother Laurie, 27, said: 'When she gets cold, she turns blotchy blue. It starts in her hands then travels up her arms, feet, legs then face.

'She has magic gloves which reflect 95 per cent of the heat back into her body.'

Gracie's condition means even normal activities such as going outside can become a challenge, and she is not allowed to eat ice cream or consume very cold drinks.

She doesn't leave the house without dressing in thermals, several layers, two pairs of socks and a hat and scarf - as well as her  silver gloves.

'The winter months are awful,' said her mother, who takes Gracie's temperature three times a day to check it doesn't drop too low.

'She can't go outside to play and now she is older can't eat ice cream or cold foods because her hands swell when she handles cold things.

'My heating is constantly on, and I have got her a heated blanket that I plug into the cigarette lighter which helps to keep her warm when we're in the car.'

Gracie also frequently suffers Raynaud's attacks at bath time. 

Her mother added: 'It's scary. People have stopped me in the street to say she's wrapped up too much and will overheat. 

'While I want her to be a "normal" child, there are normal things that she just can't do.

'So it's a balance of letting her do all the other things little girls, while I'm permanently worried about her having an attack.'

Gracie, from Barry, South Wales, was diagnosed with Raynaud's a year ago when she was 16 months old - despite her mother noticing from birth she was often cold and turning blue.

Miss Hughes said: 'The worst I have seen is when her hands went almost black and looked like they were about to drop off.

'I was so worried because I was taking her to the doctor and the hospital but all the tests they were doing were coming back clear.

'They just kept telling me there was nothing wrong but I had a mother's instinct.

Raynaud's condition, triggered by a sudden drop in temperature, causes the blood vessels in the fingers and toes contract, cutting off blood supply. 

It can also affect the tiny arteries in the nose, ears and tongue.

Typically, Raynaud’s causes the fingers or toes to turn white and numb. 

Then, as the blood flow returns, they turn blue and eventually red, accompanied by a burning sensation. 

Attacks can last from a few minutes to an hour.

Nine out of ten cases are in women, with most sufferers having their first attack before the age of 40. 

Although attacks peak in the cold winter months, symptoms can be triggered by everyday tasks such as taking food out of the freezer, air conditioning, or even stress — all of which cause blood vessels to contract.

There are two types of Raynaud’s. Primary Raynaud’s, which tends to run in families, is generally quite mild. 

Most patients can cope by wrapping up warm, although some develop painful weeping ulcers, which can become infected.

'She was finally seen by a rheumatologist at the hospital in Cardiff who told me what it was, which was great.'

Her mother said: 'Gracie absolutely loves Frozen and when I noticed that she was a bit like Elsa, she thought it was brilliant.  

'She's getting to the age now where she doesn't understand why she has to wear gloves all the time so I tell her she's like Elsa and Elsa is special, which cheers her up.

'She loves being like Elsa, just like a real-life queen.

'There might be a day where she grows out of it and I hope that when she's older she can go out there and have a normal life.

'In the meantime it's just about teaching her how to deal with it so she can lead as much of a normal life as possible.'

Liz Bevins, CEO of the Raynaud's & Scleroderma Association, said: 'Raynaud's can affect anyone of any age - babies, young children, adolescents, mature adults and the elderly.

'Cold hands and feet are frequently overlooked, put up with and considered nothing more than a nuisance but if you do suffer from cold extremities frequently, please don't ignore it.

'Some of the above diseases have silent phases, so you have very few symptoms or know no pain until the disease is in it's later stages.

'A few simple tests may be able to diagnose the above conditions much earlier, so we're encouraging you to go to your local GP and discuss any concerns you have , or get in touch with us for further help .

'Those looking after someone with the condition can also experience distress. We are here to help those people who suffer from the condition but also assist their families and carers to get the help and information they need.'
