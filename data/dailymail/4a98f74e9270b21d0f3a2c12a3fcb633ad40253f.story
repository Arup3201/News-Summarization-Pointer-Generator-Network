More than 50 British Muslim charities are being covertly observed over fears they may be linked to extremism and radicalisation.

In the last two years, charity regulator the Charity Commission has marked 55 charities with an issue code called 'extremism and radicalisation', without the knowledge of the organisations concerned.

And of the 44 ongoing investigations launched by the regulator since January 2013, 17 concern Muslim-linked charities.

More than 50 British Muslim charities are being observed over fears they may be linked to extremism, while five organisations working in Syria, including al-Fatiha Global which British hostage Alan Henning was working with when he was kidnapped, are the focus of ongoing statutory inquiries by the Charity Commission

Five British charities working in Syria, including al-Fatiha Global which British hostage Alan Henning was working with when he was kidnapped last December, are also the focus of ongoing statutory inquiries.

The figures were revealed in a request under the Freedom of Information Act by think tank Claystone, which works to promote social cohesion for British Muslims.

It says the new issue code was introduced in December 2012, three months after Sir William Shawcross was appointed as chairman of the Commission that September.

The following year, Sir William brought in a new board, including former Metropolitan Police counter terrorism chief Peter Clarke, and he has described the cause of Islamic extremism as the 'most deadly' faced by the charity sector.

'The Commission has labelled 55 charities with the issue code "extremism and radicalisation" without their knowledge,' writes Claystone's Adam Belaon in his report, 'Muslim Charities: A Suspect Sector'.

'This means the Commission has flagged up 55 charities which will be monitored as a potential concern for matters relating to extremism and radicalisation in the period December 5th 2012 to May 8th 2014.

'The criteria for applying and removing this issue code is not in a written form which can be scrutinised. We were informed that “an issue code is applied solely on the basis of the subject and type of allegations or concerns that have come to the attention of the Commission".'

In his report, Mr Balaon said Muslim charities had been 'disproportionately affected' by investigations, and that some of the charities being monitored by the Commission had been subjected to questioning over tenuous links to extremist clerics.

Pledge: Last month David Cameron said the Charity Commission would receive an extra £8million and tougher powers

Quoting a trustee of an unnamed charity, the report states: 'We were questioned at length about different religious clerics who in most cases had done nothing more than deliver one lecture at a fundraising event some time in the past for us. We were quoted snippets from lectures they had given at events that were nothing to do with us and asked to provide explanations.'

Another had told the report authors: 'It felt like the assumption was we were apologists for extremists unless we could justify why we weren’t. If the Commission felt that unlawful speech had been used they should have gone to the Police with their quotes.'

Last month, Prime Minister David Cameron pledged that the Charity Commission would receive an extra £8million and tougher powers to put the squeeze on bogus good causes which divert cash to terrorism and other criminal activity.

An automatic ban on anyone with convictions for certain criminal offences becoming a trustee of a charity is one of the changes included in a draft Protection of Charities Bill - as well as the power for the Commission to disqualify anyone they consider unfit.

It will also be allowed to shut down charities under investigation to protect public confidence, to issue an official warning in less serious cases and to prevent people resigning to avoid disqualification before returning in another guise.

That same month, Sir William said there was a 'risk' that money donated by members of the public had been sent to fighters with the so-called Islamic State, and said the watchdog was scrutinising 86 charities at risk from extremism, including 37 working with Syria victims.

But Mr Balaon said: 'Thus far there has been no empirical evidence to substantiate concerns that British Muslim charities are surreptitiously operating with the purpose of supporting terrorist or extremist activities.' 

A Commission spokesman told MailOnline: 'The Commission does not target Muslim, any other religion or type of charity. All our casework is prioritised and assessed for action against the Risk Framework, published on the website. We are keen to remove the perception that this is not the case.

'A full analysis of the Commission's compliance work including investigative and monitoring work for the last financial year will be in this year's publication Tackling Abuse and Mismanagement.'
