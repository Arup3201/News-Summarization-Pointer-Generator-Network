Liverpool will take their summer spending past £100million after chief executive Ian Ayre flew to Spain to complete the signings of Alberto Moreno and Javi Manquillo.

They are understood to be close to agreeing a £20m fee with Sevilla for their 22-year-old left back and Ayre is expected to negotiate a two-year loan for Atletico Madrid right back Manquillo.

It will include an agreement to sign the 20-year-old in a permanent £6m deal.

Liverpool have spent almost £90m on Adam Lallana, Rickie Lambert, Dejan Lovren, Emre Can, Lazar Markovic and Divock Origi.

Manager Brendan Rodgers indicated that there would be more arrivals after his side beat Manchester City in a penalty shootout after a 2-2 draw at New York’s Yankee Stadium.

‘We still have some business to do,’ said Rodgers. ‘We have some positions that we want to fill so by the end of August we’ll have a strong squad to go forward with.’

Jordan Henderson, who scored  Liverpool’s first goal, said: ‘The new signings are very good, and I hope they can kick on and strengthen us.’

And whilst their fans fans may be lamenting the 
loss of Luis Suarez, Liverpool's players were in good spirits as 
they let loose on tour in New York.

Brendan
 Rodgers' men were seen out at a bar in the city, relaxing before they
 have to head back to England and the real work begins. 

Team bonding: Adam Lallana, Martin Skrtel, Jordan Henderson, Simon Mignolet, Pepe Reina, Jon Flanagan, Brad Jones, Glen Johnson, Joe Allen, Steven Gerrard, Jack Robinson, Martin Kelly and Conor Coady pose

Home comforts: Luacs, and Philippe Coutinho head to a Brazilian steakhouse with Skrtel and Coates

There
 were some noticeable absentees. Raheem Sterling and a number of others 
were missing, presumably because they are not yet 21 and so cannot drink
 in America.

That did not seem to stop 20-year-old Jack Robinson, though, who can be seen in the centre.

Steven
 Gerrard posted the picture on his Instagram account accompanied by the 
words: 'Can't beat a bit of team bonding and what a great city to do it 
#NYC #LFC.'
