Gwyneth Paltrow is a star renowned for her super healthy (and some would say extreme) diets.

Previously a proponent of the rigid macrobiotic diet, which she followed for two years, in recent years she has relaxed her approach to food and taken to sharing her appreciation of it on her lifestyle blog Goop, or via her own cook book.

She even dialled live into the U.S. Rachael Ray talk show  from her kitchen, where she could be seen swigging red wine while she defended claims she had not written the recipes herself.

Now, Gwyneth's latest blog post reveals that, unlike so many other women in January, she will not be putting herself through the torture of the annual New Year detox diet.

Health guru: Gwyneth is known for healthy lifestyle and beauty regime, which she credits with keeping her looking so youthful and slim at 40-years-old

‘Happy 2013! I am not on a detox. I am not on a diet. I know, New Year’s cleansing and all that. Not this year. Can't do it. Maybe later in the year. Maybe in the spring.’

However, the news does not mean she has abandoned her healthy eating principles: ‘So for now, I would like to continue with my pasta and cheese, but perhaps be more mindful of ingredients,' she adds.

'I asked my friend Dr. Frank Lipman about his list of superfoods so that I could incorporate them into my diet a bit more.’

Preaching the benefits of a healthy 
lifestyle (as well as shopping, places to visit, books to read) Goop has
a huge following of fans all keen to emulate Ms Paltrow's pure and 
virtuous lifestyle.

The New Year post, complied by Gwyneth and Dr Lipman, lists nine suggested superfoods which you can incorporate into your diet, along with a sample recipe for each.

Surprisingly non-exotic and obtainable, the list includes blueberries, cruciferous vegetables (lettuce to you and me), dark chocolate, spinach, walnuts, beans, avocado and wild salmon.

The only mysterious item on the list is the chia seeds. These small dark seeds are rich in antioxidant, calcium, phosphorus and manganese as well as being high in fibre.

Gwyneth used her lifestyle website Goop.com to announce her intention NOT to diet this New Year - but instead to incorporate more superfoods into her diet

Dr Lipman says: ‘the simplest path to vibrant health – and a spectacular New Year – starts with these nine superfoods – those naturally perfect foods which support the health, growth and maintenance of your body, just by loading up your plate.’

Avocados are one of the 9 suggested superfoods

Some of the recipes don’t even sound like health food at all - walnut pesto pasta, Avocado Temaki (Hand Roll), and Spinach & Black Bean Burrito are all on the menu, with step by step instructions, with accompanying photos.

However the chia seed pudding and Crispy Romanesco with Lemon Aioli (essentially baked lettuce pieces with sauce) may not quite be to everyone’s taste.

The end of the blog sees Gwyneth posting idyllic photos of her most recent holiday at Sugar Beach in St Lucia which she describes as ‘heaven’.

One shot sees the 40-year-old star in her bikini, posing with her two children Apple, eight, and six-year-old Moses.

A perfect advert for her way of life, Ms Paltrow looks toned and youthful in the snaps, no doubt prompting many to follow her latest dietary advice.
