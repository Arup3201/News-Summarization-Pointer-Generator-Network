Judging by the show of force, you’d be forgiven for thinking a major terror alert was under way.

However, ranks of armed police, along with dogs, a helicopter and 18 cars were actually swooping on an illegal bare-knuckle fight.

Up to 500 travellers from Ireland and all over Britain had gathered on a Staffordshire industrial estate for the clash. 

Staffordshire police dispatched 18 police cars to the scene as well as armed officers and a helicopter following reports of gunfire

Police cordoned off the area after being called to reports of gunfire following a gipsy boxing match in Chesterton, Staffordshire

Police rushed in after a 999 caller claimed guns had been fired between two groups in cars.

There had also been reports of speeding vehicles being driven erratically as occupants brandished baseball bats and knives.

One member of the traveller community said the gunshots had been fired after the Fight Club-style boxing match had ended, forcing police to cordon off the site.

Joe Joyce, 23, who arrived from Ireland for the fight, said: ‘It was an organised event that attracted more than 400 people.

‘It is illegal and the police didn’t know anything about it. They wouldn’t have let it happen if they had known.

‘There were no problems during the fight but an incident happened after and they made everyone leave. Let’s just say, “Bang bang”.’

Bryan Parker, 24, who also came from Ireland for the fight, said: ‘It’s a big event that almost 500 people went to. Something happened after the fight but I can’t talk about it.’

After police cars poured into the Parkhouse Industrial Estate in Chesterton on Sunday afternoon, armed officers in body armour stood guard as colleagues seized axes, baseball bats, hammers and fireworks.

Armed officers with police dogs came in full body armour after the 999 call and seized 'a significant number of weapons'

Travellers who went to the fight, some of whom came from  Ireland, said there was 'an incident' afterwards but refused to give details

Julie Nelson, of APC Pick Up Services on the estate, said the travellers’ cars had been speeding through town earlier in the day. 

She added: ‘A Range Rover came down the road at full pelt, followed by two transit vans. They stopped in the road, got out of their vans and were arguing. There was a police helicopter over the estate for about two hours. People were quite worried, what with armed police and dogs around.’

A worker from a joinery firm on the estate, who did not want to be named, said: ‘It got really ugly after the fight – tensions were high and there was a lot of people obviously armed to the teeth.’

Staffordshire Police confiscated a ‘significant number of weapons’, and a 27-year-old woman was arrested on suspicion of possessing an offensive weapon. Inspector Mark Barlow said: ‘We are investigating reports that a significant number of the travelling community travelled to the area for an illegal fight.’

A number of families with large vans and caravans remained on the industrial estate this morning, though there is no suggestion they are linked with the reported disorder

Police say they are carrying out regular patrols of the area to reassure local residents that the violence is unlikely to re-occur

The industrial estate was quiet, with most firms who rent units taking Sunday off, but witnesses reported erratic driving and scuffles
