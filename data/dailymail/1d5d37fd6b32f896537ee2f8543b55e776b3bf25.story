Jose Mourinho has called for Burnley striker Ashley Barnes to be banned for what he claims was a 'criminal' and 'career-ending' tackle on Nemanja Matic.

Matic was sent off for a retaliatory shove in Chelsea's 1-1 draw with Burnley and will miss three games including the Capital One Cup final against Spurs next Sunday.

But the Chelsea boss understands why the red mist descended on the Serbian midfielder.

A refereeing performance in a Southern Mediterranean or South American country like Martin Atkinson's at Stamford Bridge on Saturday would have started accusations of corruption.

'End of career,' said Mourinho. 'I can't find words to describe what that player did. I can't find an adjective any stronger than to say end of career.

'Matic is a lucky guy. Matic had reason to lose his emotions. What are the consequences of Matic's push on the other player? Nothing. One second later, he stands and goes. The consequence for Matic could be the end of career.'

Mourinho noted a seven-match ban imposed on Barnes two years ago for tripping a referee and used it to make a point about officials being influenced by Diego Costa's reputation.

'This Burnley player involved in two actions has a grey past,' said the Chelsea boss, speaking on Sky Sports less than 24 hours after refusing to discuss the incident. 'There was a very dark point in his career when he was suspended for seven matches, because of a big incident with a referee.'

He also criticised Sky's coverage of Costa's stamp on Liverpool's Emre Can, and added: 'When you say Diego's 'crimes' because he put his foot on another man you have to say this is a criminal tackle.'

Mourinho admitted his comments could lead him back into trouble with the Football Association and he might be right, since he accused them of being influenced by things happening beyond the confines of the game in question.

Chelsea were last night still deciding whether to appeal Matic's red card.

Mourinho identified four key incidents which he believes influenced Chelsea's draw with Burnley

FA disciplinary chiefs will study referee Martin Atkinson's report before they examine the two Barnes incidents - the tackle on Matic and a challenge on Branislav Ivanovic. The clash with Ivanovic is less likely to be reviewed as Atkinson awarded a free-kick at the time.

Roberto Martinez, meanwhile, accused Mourinho's players of pressurising referee Jon Moss during Everton's defeat at Chelsea, two weeks ago, when Gareth Barry was dismissed and Ivanovic grabbed James McCarthy by the neck in the ensuing skirmish.

'I never felt there was any consistency in judging every action equally between the two teams,' said Martinez, in his programme notes for yesterday's 2-2 draw against Leicester.

'Unfortunately, the sending off really late on reflected the emphasis that the home team had in trying to influence the referee and take advantage of their role of playing at Stamford Bridge.

'Big games need strong referees but for the future we relish the challenge of finding the way of overcoming these disadvantages by playing our football.'

30 - Ashley Barnes sends Branislav Ivanovic crashing to the ground in an aerial challenge after a knee in the back. Ivanovic rolls over twice before leaping up when he realises no action is being taken. It should have been a free-kick and could have been a yellow card for Barnes.

69 - Barnes misses the ball and almost snaps Nemanja Matic's left shin with his studs but Atkinson waves play on. An enraged Matic leaps up and pushes Barnes over. Atkinson sends off Matic and books Ivanovic for trying to take red card out of his hand. It was a shocking tackle that merited a red card for Barnes and a Chelsea free-kick.
