Prince Harry has photobombed New Zealand Commonwealth Games officials in Glasgow - and they were so chuffed one of them made it their profile picture on Facebook.

The Prince gave a cheeky thumbs up in the background of a selfie taken by New Zealand rugby sevens coach Sir Gordon Tietjens, Sport Manawatu chief executive Trevor Shailer and Massey University Professor Emeritus Gary Hermansson

The three men in the their black and white New Zealand team kits leaned in with their arms around each other as the Royal popped up in the background in a white shirt.

They were watching the 800m women's swimming freestyle in Glasgow on Monday night, which saw Welsh swimmer Jazz Carlin win gold.

Special moment: Shailer posted the photo as his profile picture on Facebook, he was inundated with comments from friends

The royal seemed thrilled to be introduced to the triumphant athletes at the Glasgow National Hockey centre, and posed for photographs with the Aussie team, nicknamed the Hockeyroos.

Despite England's loss, Harry, 29, seemed in a jovial mood and smiled as he mingled with the players, who are favourites to win gold in the games, having taken the top spot in Delhi in 2010 and Melbourne in 2006.

After shaking hands with the winning players, Harry went on to pose for photographs with his arms around them.

The Prince, presumably in a gracious mood, also commiserated with the England team.

Jodie Kenny and Emily Smith, who between them scored their teams' goals, looked particularly thrilled in the aftermath of their victory.

The team took the royal visit as further proof of their world domination, later tweeting: 'Prince Harry is on board the #roovolution as meets @Anna_Flanagan and the girls after today's win over England'

The game means Australia is safely through to the last four, securing the top place finish in Pool B with four wins from four and a goal record of 25 scored and 0 conceded.

England began brightly as birthday girl Susannah Townsend found Ellie Watton and tried to attack the goal, but were blocked by Australian keeper Rachael Lynch.

Two quick scores, however, had England on the back foot as first Kenny converted from a penalty corner on 17 minutes, before Smith capitalised on a mistake from captain Kate Richardson-Walsh shortly afterwards.

Maddie Hinch in the England goal was forced to save two shots from Kenny before the break, while Lily Owsley fired a shot just wide of the mark. 

A green card for Laura Unsworth proved costly 13 minutes into the second half as shortly after she left the field, Kenny slotted home from another short corner.

England kept pressing and earned two penalty corners of their own but on both occasions they couldn’t find the target – Sam Quek seeing an effort deflected behind.

Georgie Twigg also made her return for England after missing their last game against Malaysia through the injury she sustained in the opening game.

After the match, England coach Danny Kerry said: 'Australia were better than us defensively and offensively in both circles but I actually felt for large periods of the game we were playing the more constructive hockey.

'The reality is that we need to be much tougher in both circles and their corner execution was superior to ours today.'

Undeterred: Harry looked pleased with his company today after the hockey game, which was part of a busy day in which he also watched boxing and gymnastics
