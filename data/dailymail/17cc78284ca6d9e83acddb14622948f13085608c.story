The Tories will not pledge to keep the defence budget at the Nato target of 2 per cent of national income after the election.

David Cameron and George Osborne are expected to fend off pressure from right-wing Conservatives and military top brass to avoid cuts.

Insiders say the party’s election manifesto will instead pledge only to maintain the armed forces’ headcount and spending on equipment.

At least they've still GOT boots: A European Leadership Network report published today warns the UK's defence budget is likely to fall to 1.88 per cent of GDP – its lowest level in 25 years

A report published today will warn that the defence budget is likely to fall to 1.88 per cent of GDP – its lowest level in 25 years – and below the Nato target.

It will suggest that friendly nations should ‘share the burden’ of defence when a threatening Russia is increasing its military budget by 33 per cent.

MPs have said the twin threats from Vladimir Putin and Islamic State make for the ‘most dangerous’ period in 20 years.

The report from the European Leadership Network, a London-based think-tank, says defence spending will fall from £36.4billion last year to around £35.5billion in 2015/16. The percentage of national income spent on the military would drop from 2.07 per cent to 1.88 per cent.

The report offers a preliminary analysis of defence spending in 14 Nato member states and found only Estonia will hit the 2 per cent target in 2015.

Six will increase their military expenditure but they still will not meet the mark. Another six countries are expected to cut defence spending in 2015, including the UK, Germany, Canada, Italy, Hungary and Bulgaria.

The report warns that ‘burden-sharing is becoming a necessity, not a choice’, as none of the Nato countries – with the exception of the US – have the ‘funding or the domestic support to fully modernise their militaries’.

They also cannot ‘comprehensively develop their individual defence capacity’. It concludes: ‘More defence cooperation among allies is the only realistic way forward.’

Britain, for example, has been forced to rely on other Nato countries to search for suspected Russian submarines off the Scottish coast after the Government scrapped sea patrol planes.

The report said: ‘One would have to assume that the UK will not follow through on some important equipment purchases at all, or will significantly scale back on the number of some aircraft and naval platforms currently slated for purchase.’

This could include the Queen Elizabeth Class aircraft carriers, the biggest and most powerful Royal Navy surface warships, and fighter planes.

Ian Kearns, co-author of the report, said: ‘This preliminary analysis of 2015 defence spending decisions in Nato shows the credibility of any European pillar of the alliance is being further undermined. Despite the rhetoric about events in Ukraine being a game-changer for European security, the reality looks more like business as usual.’

Sir Gerald Howarth, a former defence minister, said it would be ‘utter folly’ if the 2 per cent target was not maintained.

‘With all that is going on in the world, not least in Russia, it has got to be a really serious election commitment,’ he said. ‘Surely the last century has taught us the lessons of not being prepared.

‘President Putin understands strength, not weakness and at the moment we risk being seen as weak.’

He called for less money to be spent on overseas aid: ‘By not committing to 2 per cent it will reinforce the fact we are diminished and we are diminishing ourselves further. We can transfer the extra money we are spending on overseas aid on defence.’

Rory Stewart, chairman of the Commons defence committee, said: ‘If we drop below the 2 per cent Nato target, Putin will interpret it as a sign of weakness – Russian actions in the Ukraine show that Putin is exploiting what he perceives as lack of conviction.

‘It should be a manifesto commitment from all the parties. We need to have a very honest conversation with the public. The world is more dangerous than any time in the past 20 years.’

Asked if Britain was ready for a war with Russia, Defence Secretary Michael Fallon said: ‘Nato is getting ready – that is the point of the commitment to the high readiness task force and the defence expenditure.

‘Getting other countries up to 2 per cent is equally important.’
