Florida Seminole's college footballer Jameis Winston has hit back at criticism over the way he speaks, reminding fans 'We're national champions'.

The 20-year-old defended himself on Twitter after A.J. McCarron's mother Dee Dee and his 
model girlfriend Katherine Webb sparked a race row when they 
appeared to question his ability to speak English.

After Winston's post-game interview as his team beat the Auburn Tigers, Ms McCarron had tweeted: 'Am I listening to English?'

Unfazed: Fresh from his team's victory, Winston brushed off criticism over the way he talks

The 43-year-old was forced to retract her comment after a massive backlash online, in which she was labeled as racist.

The mother-of-five almost 
immediately deleted the tweet, and issued an apology denying that she or
 her Alabama quarterback son A.J. is racist and that her question 
was not meant to be racially offensive.

Her son's girlfriend also apologized, saying she didn't mean to favorite a tweet in which a fan 
told the quarterback to 'learn sign language to communicate because 
listening to him attempt to speak English is just insulting.'

For Winston however, the glow of victory carried him over the criticisms, TMZ reported.

He took to Twitter to say: 'For the people that criticize the way that I talk this is for y'all. The Florida state Seminoles are national champions! That is all.'

The college quarterback had been criticized for a garbled interview as he spoke to an ESPN broadcaster after his team's victory.

'We champions,' Winston said in a breathless manner. 'We
 can share that. We are champions together. And through everything that 
we went through. Through all the haters. Through every single thing, we 
came our victorious. God did this.'

Denial: Dee Dee McCarron clarified to her followers on Twitter that her attack on Winston was not racist

Mistake: Katherine Webb claimed that when she favorited a tweet that was critical of Jameis Winston it was by accident

While Winston's perceived lack of eloquence drew the ire of Ms McCarron, the response from the public to her public mocking of him was furious.
