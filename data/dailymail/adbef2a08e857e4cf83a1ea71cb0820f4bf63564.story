A 44-year-old woman thought having facial fillers injected into her cheeks would help her feel and look more youthful.

Instead, she was left with lumps under her skin that made it painful for her even to smile.

Self-employed Jo said: 'I can feel them all the time in my face, there's one that feels like a cigarette on my face and that hurts all the time.

Treatment gone wrong: Jo was left with lumps around her chin and cheeks after having facial fillers

'It has taken my confidence away from me and what worries me is I'm told it could get worse. I wish I'd never started it.'

Ironically Jo had treated herself to the treatment in the hope of raising her spirits after she tragically lost her sister at the age of 29.

She explained: 'When my sister died it made me 
realise I wanted to live a long time and look good. So I went and had it done to cheer myself up.'

'I could feel the lumps straight away': Mr Vik Vijh at the Last Chance Salon examined Jo to see if there was anything he could do to help

Three years ago Jo had permanent synthetic filler injected into her face but she suffered an adverse reaction to it - leaving her with lumps and bumps under her skin.

She contacted the TV show Last Chance Salon to see if they could help.

The show's resident cosmetic surgery expert Mr Vik Vijh examined Jo to see if there was anything he could do.

'I could feel the filler right away and see it through the skin,' he said. 'Her skin felt pretty hard and painful.'

Finally the result she wanted: After going under the knife, Jo (before, left) had the filler removed and her own fat was used to plump up her cheeks instead (after, right)

Mr Vijh believed he could help Jo if she would go under the knife so he could lift her skin and remove the lumps of filler.

The show followed Jo's surgery and revealed how Mr Vijh removed a 'big c-shaped piece of filler' from her face.

'There's tiny specks of it everywhere,' he said as he operated.

After removing these lumps, he then gave Jo a face lift and gave her cheeks the fuller look she was looking for initially by adding her own fat to her face.

'Your own fat is the best filler you can get as your body doesn't react to it,' he explained.

After recovering from the surgery, Jo was delighted with her new look.

'I can't stop smiling. I feel brilliant and I can see the difference. I didn't think I'd ever feel like this again,' she said.

Her husband Steve, who supported her through out her ordeal agreed.

'Having her back to herself is great. She's a handful but I have missed that handful!' he joked.
