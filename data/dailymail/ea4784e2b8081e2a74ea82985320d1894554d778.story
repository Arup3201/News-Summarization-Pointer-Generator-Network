Ever lost your holiday luggage on a flight? Well, don't give up hope just yet.

Maria Dellos of Tucson, Arizona, has been reunited with baggage that went missing 20 years ago.

She received a call from Tucson International Airport on Tuesday about her old bag, containing art supplies from a Las Vegas trade show worth an estimated $600.

The carrier had apparently been buried away in storage and forgotten about until a recent spring clean. It is unclear which airline was responsible for losing it.

Almost forgotten about: She received a call from someone at Tucson International Airport on Tuesday about her old bag, which contained art supplies (pictured) from a Las Vegas trade show worth an estimated $600

It is also unknown how TSA agents tracked Dellos down with no luggage label to go on. However, typing her name into Google along with the word 'art' pulls up her website to the top spot with her contact details listed.

On opening the goods Dellos, a full-time artist, said she was absolutely 'thrilled' and the paints are still very 'creamy and usable.' 

She told News 4 Tucson that she almost ignored the call from the TSA lost and found department because she thought is was telemarketer.

At the airport she opened the contents of her bag with a camera crew watching.

She discovered handwritten notes inside her case, with her old address of 20 years ago scrawled on one piece of paper.

'When I looked at this note, it was dated, it dated me as 20 years ago! And I was just absolutely blown away,' she said.

TSA Spokesperson Nico Melendez said that the items are 'interesting' because they pre-date the agency.

The government body was established in 2001 and is now responsible for screening passengers and baggage at more than 450 U.S. airports.

Melendez says that Dellos' bag probably surfaced during a recent reshuffle of equipment at the airport. 

Dellos had used dozens of plastic baggies to stop her art supplies from leaking and Melendez praised her for being ahead of the game, as this is now a modern day requirement for liquids. 

Dellos hasn't been very lucky in the luggage department. She also had a bag go missing in August but thankfully that was returned recently too. 

Last year there was an estimated 22 million pieces of lost, damaged or delayed baggage around the world. 

The top cause for such problems were handlers making transfer errors between planes.
