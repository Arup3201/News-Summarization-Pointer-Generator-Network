A single mother of two from Los Angeles working as a McDonald's server has boldly taken on the fast-food giant as part of a growing labor movement demanding higher wages.

Earlier this month, the woman known only as Maribel went on a strike against her employer.

In a video released by BuzzFeed last week, Maribel recounts how she was brought to the US from her native Mexico when she was only 7 months old.

Activist: Maribel, a single mother of two from Los Angeles, went on a strike against her employer McDonald's earlier this month 

Movement: Maribel has joined a group of fast-food workers demanding higher wages and union rights

Leading the charge: Maribel was at the front of the pack when fast food servers marched on her McDonald's in downtown LA chanting slogans and waving signs 

The McDonald's staffer lives in a modest house in LA's South Central neighborhood with her two kids and seven other relatives, including her grandmother and niece.

Maribel currently earns $9.35 an hour, which she says is not enough to support her one-year-old son, Brandon, and two-year-old daughter, Kaitlin.

‘I need fifteen to buy my babies diapers, their wipies, their clothes,’ she explains. ‘Its hard with nine dollars per hour — you can’t do that. It’s really hard to pay rent.’

She goes on to say: ‘If I pay my rent, I leave my kids without their diapers.’

Breadwinner: Maribel has a 2-year-old daughter and a 1-year-old son, and says the $9.35 an hour she currently earns is not enough to support her family 

Tough choices: Maribel says if she pays her rent, there is almost no money left to buy diapers for her kids

On the same day, fast food workers walked off the job in more than 150 cities, including New York, Chicago and Pittsburgh. Protesters are pictured here givign the Mockingjay salute from the Hunger Games films

Earlier this month, Maribel joined a large group of fast-food workers calling for $15 per hour and the right to unionize. 

‘We're gonna go show them that we're not scared, that we're here to fight for what we deserve,’ Maribel says in the video on the eve of the strike.

On December 4, Maribel led a group of protesters on a march to her McDonald’s eatery in South Central waving signs and chanting slogans like ‘this is what democracy looks like!’

Maribel was joined at the protest by her mother, who also works at McDonald’s.

With a yellow banner draped around her shoulder like a cape, Maribel says with a smile: 'It's really exciting to go into my own store.'

On the same day, fast food workers walked off the job in more than 190 cities, including New York, Chicago and Washington DC. 

Workers like Maribel, pictured walking out of her MCDonald's branch, say they are fed up with pay that does not come close to keeping them out of poverty

For the first time since fast-food workers began walkouts two years ago, they were joined by workers from convenience stores and markets in 24 cities, the Fight for $15 campaign said in a statement.

Employees in low-wage jobs and labor unions supporting them are pushing to raise the minimum hourly wage to $15 -- about double the current federal minimum of $7.25.

Workers say they are fed up with pay that does not come close to keeping them out of poverty and the threat of retaliation from employers hostile to them joining or forming unions.

The Fight for $15 movement has grown since a few hundred fast-food workers went on strike in New York in late November 2012 to push for a "living wage" of $15 an hour.

In August 2013, fast-food workers launched their first national day-long labor strike, in 60 cities, and their outcry has increasingly resonated in national politics.

Advocates of higher hourly pay say full-time workers are kept below the poverty threshold for a family of four at the current wage. Opponents say the protests are tainted because they involved major labor organizations.

Fast-food chains say their locations are largely owned by independent operators who are responsible for pay rates of employees.
