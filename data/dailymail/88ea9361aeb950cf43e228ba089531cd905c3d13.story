Former supermodel Paula Hamilton is to be prosecuted for drink-driving after crashing her car into a neighbour’s conservatory.

The 51-year-old surrendered to police bail this week and was told she was to be summonsed for driving with excess alcohol after a blood test allegedly proved positive.

A sample of Hamilton’s blood was taken by a police surgeon and sent for analysis following the serious crash which happened near the star’s home in Farnham Common, Buckinghamshire.

She was the centre of a police investigation last month when her green coloured Hyundai car veered off the road, demolished a telegraph pole and a garden fence before crashing into a newly-built conservatory.

Police found a mystery man sitting alone in the wreckage of the car and a police tracker dog later discovered Hamilton crouching in another garden.

Miss Hamilton, who shot to fame as the face of Volkswagen cars in the 1980s,  was rushed to Wycombe General Hospital in High Wycombe, having lost her two front teeth in the crash.

However, she claimed she was done more physical harm when 'mauled' by the police dog in the aftermath of the crash and thanks the car manufacturers for saving both her life and her long, model legs.

This week she surrendered to bail at High Wycombe Police Station and was told that she would be reported for alleged drink-driving.

She was expected to appear before magistrates before Christmas to enter a plea to the allegation. She was released on unconditional bail until a date is set.

A spokesman for Thames Valley Police said: 'We can confirm that a 51-year-old woman from Farnham Common has been reported for summons for alleged drink-driving. This follows the results of a blood analysis.

'We are waiting to hear a court date for her appearance.'

At the time of the crash, which happened just 200 yards from Hamilton’s home, neighbour Manohar Gogna told how he was awoken by the crash as the car slammed into his newly-built £20,000  conservatory.

The retired BT worker said that he was told by police that a car was embedded in his glasshouse.

'We were lucky that it happened in the early hours of the morning and not when my grandchildren were in there,' said 68-year-old Mr Gogna.

Speaking shortly after the accident, at her red-brick mansion on a private drive hidden back from the street, she lifted up her top to reveal a scar on her back.

The brunette, who said she has Asperger’s syndrome, was bitten by a police dog in the aftermath of the horrific crash.

However,
she claimed police laughed and watched the mutt 'maul' her as she lay 
curled helplessly in a ball, an instinctive reaction of Asperger’s 
sufferers in panicked situations.

She said: 'I got mauled by a dog. It bit me on the back and it mauled my teeth out - I wasn’t even arrested.

'When I got out of the car I rolled into a ball because I’m Asperger’s, which is on the autistic spectrum, and this is a common reaction among people with Asperger’s.

'The dog mauled me while I was lying there and the police just watched and laughed at me.'

She has scars on her back as well as on her arm and hand, including a hole in one of her fingers.

Despite the force of the impact, with no airbag in her seven-year-old car, she claims her four front teeth were knocked out by the police dog’s attack.

Paula, who at times burst into song in response to questions she did want to answer, claimed to have demanded meetings with the police and said she was being given treatment only a Prime Minister or senior politician would get.

Dentists have already begun £15,000 treatment to have implants fitted in her gums, into which fake teeth will screw.

The former model was the face of 
Volkswagen cars when she starred in a blockbuster advert in 1987 
which made her a household name.

The iconic ad, directed by David Bailey showed the model dressed up to resemble Princess Diana and posting an engagement ring through the letterbox of her partner's front door. She rips off her pearl necklace, discards a brooch and sheds her fur coat but stops short of ditching the car keys down a drain, instead choosing to drive off with a smile on her face.

Since then she has struggled with addiction and a complicated personal life.

She had a brief marriage to a cameraman in 1987 as well as a 
disastrous affair with the billionaire former Conservative party 
vice-chairman Lord Ashcroft. In the 1990s she was  engaged to film-maker
Henry Cole.

Last year, she revealed that she had lost her virginity to X-Factor svengali Simon Cowell, her childhood sweetheart from their days growing up in leafy Hertfordshire.
