 

He has been accused of the most heinous of crimes.

Luring a pregnant young woman to a remote mountainside, murdering her in cold blood and dumping her lifeless body down an abandoned mine-shaft in the hope she will never be found.

But for those who know former Marine rifleman Christopher Brandon Lee it seems unthinkable that this 'family man' with a 'big heart' could have killed 19-year-old Erin Corwin.

Family man: Christopher Lee was a devoted husband to wife Nichole and loving father to six-year-old Liberty. He was a very gentle and patient father, friends tell MailOnline

Home on the range: In these snaps, taken in July just after Erin vanished, the  little cow girl Liberty, holding a toy gun, gets cozy with her mom and dad. They were staying in the bunk house of the friend's horse ranch before moving to Alaska

As our exclusive photos show, Lee seemed every bit the devoted husband to wife Nichole and loving father to six-year-old Liberty.

In a series of snaps he posed with his little ‘cow girl’ sat on his knee holding a toy gun and his wife beside him.

And in exclusive video obtained by MailOnline horse lover Lee is also seen happily showing children how to ride a miniature pony around a paddock.

And two days before Erin’s disappearance friends say Lee attended a children's birthday party in which he delivered a birthday cake to a young girl.

But behind his popular 'nice guy' image was Lee hiding a dark side that cost a young girl her life? Did he snap simply to stop his family unit from falling apart?

Lonely: MailOnline has learned Erin became ‘distant’ from her husband Marine Corporal Jonathan Corwin because he was often deployed for weeks at a time on ‘war game’ maneuvers away from the Twentynine Palms base. She was a friend of Lee's wife Nichole.  It’s believed Lee cheated on high-school sweetheart Nichole with  neighbor Erin in a secret five-month affair amid claims she became pregnant with his child

Lassoed: Horseman Christopher Lee is now lock-up in Alaska, awaiting extradition to San Bernadino County in California where he faces charges for Erin's murder 

Closer: Chris and Nichole were best friends as well as being a couple.  Friend Michele Herring said Lee and Nichole would come to the White Rock Horse Rescue Ranch at least twice a week to care for two horses they sponsored named Humorous and Mack

Erin's body was found last weekend at the bottom of a 140ft deep mineshaft two miles south east of the Twentynine Palms Marine base in California, where she lived with her husband Marine Corporal Jonathan Corwin.

Lee stands accused of murder and was charged on Tuesday with killing Erin.

The San Bernardino District Attorney’s Office also filed the special circumstance allegation of 'lying in wait', adding an even more sinister angle to the case.

Lee was arrested on Sunday by officers in Alaska and is currently awaiting extradition to California.

His arrest has come as a huge shock to his family and friends.

Close friend Michele Herring said she finds it ‘impossible’ to believe that Lee is capable of such a horrible crime.

She says he was every bit a ‘nice man’ who loved his wife and daughter.

‘He was devoted to them,’ she said. ‘He would have done anything for them.

‘He wasn’t an angry person, he was just a nice guy. Chris and Nichole were best friends as well as being a couple, the way they interacted was so good, they just got along so well.’

Michele said Lee and Nichole would come to the White Rock Horse Rescue Ranch at least twice a week to care for two horses they sponsored named Humorous and Mack.

She said Erin also visited with the couple to see her sponsored horse named Cassie and the three seemed like good friends.

But while she never saw Lee flirting with Erin she says his focus was on wife Nichole.

‘They were very much in love, very close. They were together at high-school, since they were teenagers so they had this connection.

A lot of people grow apart after high-school but Chris and Nichole never seemed to lose that closeness.

‘As for his daughter, Chris adores that little girl and Liberty loves her daddy too.

‘He was a very gentle and patient father.’

Ranch owner Isabel Megli was equally as shocked by his arrest, ‘he is a nice guy, no one expected this,’ she said.

While ranch goer David Lange added: ‘He was a normal guy, not a guy you would think capable of murder.’

Marine wife: A Sheriff Department spokesman said he wasn't aware of any marriage problems when Erin went missing

Tragic loss: Erin’s body was found last weekend at the bottom of a 140ft deep mine shaft two miles south east of the Twentynine Palms Marine base in California, where she lived with her husband. Neighbors say she was close friends with Lee's wife N

On the face of it Lee, 24, was the perfect man; a Marine who served his country, a devoted husband and a father who adored his young daughter.

Weeks away from being discharged from the Marine Corp, Lee was hoping to move his family back home to Alaska where he planned to return to school to build a better future.

But lurking behind this ‘nice-guy’ image it’s alleged a sinister side emerged.

It’s believed Lee cheated on his high-school sweetheart Nichole with his neighbor Erin in a secret five-month affair amid claims she fell pregnant with his child. 

He told police that although the two had kissed, they had never had intercourse. But the investigation found that Lee and Erin did have an 'intimate relationship' dating back to at least February, Sheriff's Sgt. Trevis Newport said.

MailOnline has learned Erin became 'distant' from her husband, Jonathan, because he was often deployed for weeks at a time on 'war game' maneuvers away from the Twentynine Palms base.

A friend, who asked not to be named, said: 'They started to grow apart because Jonathan was away all the time, he was sent away in to the wilderness for long periods, sometimes a month at a time.

'He was a corporal and would be away on war maneuvers, Erin found it hard.

'Jonathan was also very controlling and she didn’t like this. While he was away she become close to Lee, she felt she could talk to him.’

Erin – who was also close friends with Lee’s wife Nichole - learned she was pregnant two weeks before she vanished.

It’s believed she told Lee the child was his just days before he was due to leave the Marine Corp and move his family to Alaska.

It’s alleged Erin was hoping to meet with Lee on the day she disappeared so the pair could celebrate having a baby.

One theory is that Lee was shell-shocked about the pregnancy and feared his wife would almost certainly find out about the affair and leave him.

Most of all he was likely terrified that he might lose contact with his daughter Liberty as a result.

Seeing his perfect family unit crumbling before him, could Lee have then plotted to murder Erin to keep them together?

These are the questions detectives are trying to answer.

And as the San Bernadino Sheriff’s department continues its investigation every possible theory is being explored.

Police sources say Lee has admitted conducting internet searches on human body disposal, and a witness told detectives that Lee asked him 'what was the best way to dispose of a human body,' a sheriff's investigator wrote in a document filed in San Bernardino County Superior Court in support of an arrest warrant.

This tallies with the theory that Lee was allegedly premeditated in murdering Erin.

Erin’s life was cruelly snatched away on June 28 when she vanished.

Her killer dumped her body down a 140ft deep mineshaft in a remote area around two miles from her home on Twentynine Palms Marine Base in California.

Erin had told her Marine husband Jonathan she was headed to Joshua Tree National Park to scout trails she and her mother could later bike, but she never returned home.

Her Toyota Corolla was found two days later abandoned just blocks from the Twentynine Palms Marine Base.

Man in orange: Lee made his first appearance in an Anchorage, Alaska, courtroom Tuesday on murder charges. He fought his extradition to California and is being held on a $2 million bail.

According to search warrant documents, tire tracks matching those of Lee’s Jeep were found near to Erin’s car.

Search and rescue teams scoured a 300-square-miles area round Joshua Tree National Park, including more than 100 mine shafts, for nearly two months before Corwin's body was found.

The investigation grew to focus on Lee, who was the Corwins' neighbor at the Marine Base, according to court papers.

Erin’s friend told investigators that Corwin and Lee were having an affair and that the unborn child might be Lee's, the papers show.

Lee is being held on a federal hold and will be extradited to California from Alaska where he will face a murder charge.

He is accused of snuffing out a young life.
