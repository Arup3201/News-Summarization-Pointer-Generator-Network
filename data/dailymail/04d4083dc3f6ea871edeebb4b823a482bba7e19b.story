It's one of India's most colourful festivals and when Princess Beatrice was invited to get involved during a London cocktail party thrown to celebrate it, she just couldn't resist getting stuck in.

Luckily for Beatrice, that meant bindi accessories inspired by the sub-continent rather than the paint-throwing that characterises the real thing.

The 26-year-old was back on the fashion circuit for the second time in less than seven days, having stepped out for the gala launch of the Alexander McQueen Savage Beauty retrospective last week.

On that occasion, Beatrice, who is recently returned from the US where she went back to school to study a brief course in finance, opted for a daring thigh-high gown.

This time, the Princess, who was attending a party thrown by London-based Indian designer Saloni Lodha, opted for a striking emerald-green dress and a forehead decorated with bindis.

Ms Lodha, who grew up in Mumbai but has also lived in Seoul and Hong Kong, launched her eponymous label in 2008 and counts Samantha Cameron and Michelle Obama among her fans.

Now stocked at Net-a-Porter and Matches among others, she is famous for her love of colourful print and flatteringly feminine designs.

But Ms Lodha wasn't the only print fan at the party, with fellow designer, Greek-born Mary Katrantzou, also in attendance.

Support: Last week, she turned out for the opening of the V&A's Savage Beauty McQueen retrospective

Ms Katrantzou has long championed the digital print and regularly shows eye-wateringly colourful designs at London Fashion Week.

Beatrice, who also attended London Fashion Week, has become a familiar face on London's party circuit of late.

A week before the McQueen Savage Beauty retrospective, the 26-year-old was pictured rubbing shoulders with actor Martin Sheen at another VIP event.

Joined by Branson clan, Beatrice and Mr Sheen held court at a gala dinner at the Bulgari Hotel held in aid of We Day.

Beatrice is, like her cousin Prince Harry, a supporter of the initiative which encourages young people to get involved in political life.
