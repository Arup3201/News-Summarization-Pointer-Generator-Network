A three-year-old toddler was found wandering along a busy road, half a mile from his nursery, after staff failed to notice him leave.

His mother Natasha Stokes went to collect Alfie from his playgroup on Friday afternoon and instead found him looking lost and confused in a road nearby.

Furious, she said if a predatory paedophile had spotted him on his own he could have been snatched. She now fears for his safety and is reluctant to let him return to the school.

She criticised staff at Robinswood Primary School in Gloucester for failing to notice her son’s disappearance while he was in their care.

Head teacher Martin Latham admitted: 'It was a mistake and it shouldn’t have happened.'

Natasha,from Gloucester, said she wept at the roadside as she comforted her son on Friday.

She found him on Matson avenue, half a mile away from the primary school.

She said: 'I couldn’t believe what I was seeing. My heart was in my throat. Alfie could have been kidnapped or killed. I couldn’t help but think of little April Jones.

'I was crying my eyes out and he was very confused so I just cuddled him.

'I asked him what he was doing there and he said that his teacher had let him go.'

Four members of staff were present at the preschool, but Alfie managed to bypass them all.

The school installed a new security gate at the weekend and Mr Latham held crisis talks with the mother yesterday.

But she won’t take her son back to the school just yet. She said: 'I am not convinced they can ensure his safety.

'When I went back to the school, all they could do was say sorry, but how do we know it won’t happen again?'

Miss Stokes is meeting Mr Latham again tomorrow to decide what to do with Alfie.

Mr Latham said: 'We have a clear system of how the children leave the preschool. We thought we had a secure system but something went wrong.

'It can be quite congested at home time and I think he had got out around the back.

'We have looked into it straight away and over the weekend we installed a new gate.

'It is not an excuse and we hold our hands up to it - it is ultimately my responsibility.

'We were just as concerned that he had come out of the preschool on his own.

'It is ultimately the mother’s decision as to whether Alfie returns and we will be discussing this tomorrow.'
