A man was yesterday charged with posting offensive comments on Facebook about April Jones.

Matthew Wood, 20, from Chorley, Lancashire, will appear at the town's magistrates' court today over comments posted about the missing five-year-old girl from Machynlleth, Wales.

He was arrested and charged under Section 127 of the Communications Act 2003 with sending a message or other matter that is grossly offensive on a public electronic communications network.

Helping hand: A Facebook group set up for her, called 'Find April Jones', has more than 215,00 likes

The charge comes after comments he allegedly made were posted online on his Facebook account.

The posting allegedly relates to Madeleine McCann - the British girl aged three who vanished in 2007 from the Algarve, Portugal - and was made last Thursday, reported the Lancashire Evening Post.

Yesterday, hundreds of people turned out to pay their respects as an emotional service took place for the five-year-old who went missing on Monday night from near her home in the mid Wales town.

April, who has cerebral palsy, was playing out on her bicycle as a treat for a good school report when she vanished. A Facebook group set up for her, called 'Find April Jones', has more than 215,000 likes.

Ex-lifeguard Mark Bridger, 46, was charged yesterday with her abduction and murder. He is also accused of perverting the course of justice and will be at Aberystwyth Magistrates' Court today.

A procession of more than 700 people 
walked slowly through Machynlleth, as normal life came to a standstill, 
and gathered at the Bryn-y-Gog estate from where she was abducted on 
Monday evening.

Sadness: Hundreds of people turned out to pay their respects today as an emotional service took place for missing April. They walked through the Welsh town of Machynlleth, as normal life came to a standstill

Service: Members of the community of Machynlleth attend St Peter's Church for a time of reflection on April

With crowds wearing pink ribbons symbolising the faith many still have that the girl remains alive, the procession moved in subdued silence through the town, which had roads closed off.

Inside the church, Reverend Kathleen Rogers addressed the congregation, as she offered prayers for April's parents Coral, 40, and Paul, 44, who did not attend the ceremony.

She said: ‘We cannot bring little April, our sweet and innocent little girl, home as we had hoped. But our hope has now been moved on to sure and certain hope that she is in the arms of Jesus.’

‘Coral and Paul may not be with us this morning but we hold them very close in our hearts as we pray for them. There are hundreds of people today searching our town, our countryside, our river.

‘Many hundreds more have been searching this last week. We thank them and we pray for them as they came to us in our hour of need and they continue to be with us.’
