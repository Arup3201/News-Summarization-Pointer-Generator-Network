A Narragansett man has filed a lawsuit against church officials, including the Pope, to try to silence the bells at a church opposite his Rhode Island home.

John Devaney claims St Thomas More Church's bells have disrupted his life and contributed to the demise of his marriage.

The 64-year-old, who is seeking unspecified monetary damages, said the electronic bell is sounded at least 700 times a week, which caused emotional distress, bad moods and arguments with his wife.

Peal plea: John Devaney claims the chiming bell at St Thomas More Church, opposite his home, is disruptive

He has asked a court to order the church to lessen the amount of times the bell sounds so he can enjoy his property in peace, according to CBS Connecticut.

Mr Devaney claims that when he bought his home - the former rectory - opposite the Catholic church 18 years ago, the bell was not working.

About six years ago however, a kindly parishioner donated money to restore it.

Since then, he claims it sounds three times a day, during the week, at 8am, noon and 6pm. On weekends, it sounds at 4.45pm on Saturdays, and 7.45am on Sundays, as well as for special occasions such as weddings or funerals.

'It's just a lot for a small neighborhood, a small historical neighborhood,' Mr Devaney told the Providence Journal.

He added that the digital bell was amplified and broadcast on loud speakers, and said it rang out more than 36,000 times a year.Â 

The Catholic diocese has said in a statement that the ringing is reasonable and within its rights.

A
spokesman said: 'So many in the community have enjoyed hearing the bell
for more than 10 years for but minutes a day. The parish believes the 
brief ringing of the bell is reasonable and well within its rights.'

Mr Devaney has argued that state law denies his rights under the First and Fourth Amendments to 'peaceful enjoyment of his property',

Defense: Church officials say the ringing is reasonable and within their rights as a place of worship

Gift: Narragansett church had been silent for years, until a parishioner donated money to restore the bell

He has named attorney-general Peter F Kilmartin, Diocese of Providence Bishop Thomas J Tobin, Archbishop Carlo Maria Vigano, and the Pope as defendants in his lawsuit, and asked the town to enforce noise laws.

A letter written last year to Mr Devaney, by the then town center manager Grady Miller, explained 'devices used in conjunction with places of religious worship' are exempt from noise laws, NBC 10 reported.

A statement from the diocese said: 'The parish community is saddened that a sole individual would continue personal, inappropriate attacks harassing visitors, worshippers and staff of St Thomas More Parish. As a community of faith, we will pray for peace and understanding and that all our neighbors know of our charity and concern.'
