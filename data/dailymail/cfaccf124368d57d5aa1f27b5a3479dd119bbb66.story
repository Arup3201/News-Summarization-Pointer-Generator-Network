Chaotic childhood: Josh Howie, seen aged four with his mother Lynne Franks in 1980, describes the entrepreneuer as 'unique'

What no one tells you when you become a parent is just how judgmental you will be towards fellow parents.

That feeling of self-righteous smugness as you mentally admonish how others feed, discipline and entertain their offspring can be utterly overwhelming.

And, sadly, the parents who bear the brunt of it tend to be our very own.

How can you not compare and contrast the childhood your parents gave you with what you hope to provide for your children?

Those with happy memories want to replicate their experiences, then there are others whose experiences serve as a warning, a map of exactly what not to do.

Guess which camp I fall into?

I had a unique mother. An army of nannies, chauffeurs, cleaners and cooks served in the front line of my and my sister’s young lives, presided over from far in the rear by Generalissimo Lynne Franks, aka Mummy.

My mother was the inspiration for Absolutely Fabulous’s rather bonkers PR supremo, Edina Monsoon. If you’ve ever seen Ab Fab on TV, you’ll already have a pretty clear picture of the madness I faced daily while growing up.

What wasn’t in the show was the fact I’d had more than 20 nannies by the time I was 16. Some were good, some much less so — and none could hack life in our house for long.

Even though in numerous interviews my mum has gone into how she regrets not being around for much of our childhoods, she can be sensitive when I say something similar.

I don’t want to upset her (I also have to think of the long game: I don’t want to be cut out of the will), but it’s fair to say her career came first when my sister and I were growing up.

The legend goes that 20 minutes after I was born she was on the phone to work, and she didn’t get off again until I was in my late teens.

During that time, she and my father Paul Howie, a designer, also managed to raise me as a Buddhist, shove macrobiotic food down my throat and live as a Native American. And those were the fun parts.

I didn’t think so at the time. I grumbled and whined my way through it all, but without them, I wouldn’t be the interestingly troubled soul I am today. I wouldn’t change any of it (well, maybe the macrobiotic food).

I had a life of privilege with 
expensive schools, exotic luxury holidays and the best therapists to 
complain to. I feel lucky to have had parents whose hard work led to so 
many opportunities for us — but it’s not the kind of upbringing I’d 
dream of inflicting on my own children.

I
have two young sons and the vagaries of my childhood couldn’t be more 
different to theirs.  They have two adoring parents who share the 
childcare. It is the complete opposite of the parenting model I grew up 
with.

With a third 
energy-sapper on the way to join our 11-month-old, Art, and 
three-year-old, Mordechai, a chorus of inquiries is swelling as to 
whether my wife and I will be getting a nanny. The answer is a 
thundering: ‘Never!’

At most, a friend will look after the children if my wife and I need to be somewhere.

For
us, having children is about getting our hands dirty. Not only with the
nappies, but by nourishing each offshoot of personality, each growth of
self. This is in stark contrast to my own childhood.

I’ve
no memory of the earliest nannies, but someone must have kept us alive 
during the endless days where my sister Jessica and I would be lucky to 
catch a glimpse of either parent.

Things
changed slightly when I was eight and my parents became Buddhists. From
then, what little time they did have before and after work was spent 
chanting. An hour-and-a-half every single day.

I was mesmerised by a friend's mum making a sandwich

When
it became apparent this was the only time I’d get to spend in their 
company, I joined in. I also worked out that if I wanted anything — say a
new bike — I’d just have to say I’d been chanting for one and it would 
magically appear.

At the weekends, we were all together, after a fashion. Saturdays were spent being dragged to photo- shoots and fashion shows.

It sounds exciting, but when you’re six, what this really entails is trying not to get up to too much trouble in the corner while throngs of adults run about you in a flustered panic. Flashing cameras? Supermodels? Boring!

Meanwhile, Sundays were taken up with all-day lunches in expensive trendy restaurants. Crawling under tables among the legs of the important and talented can lose its shine after a few years.

I hated the lack of consistency.

One minder left after just four hours. Bonds repeatedly formed, then broken, created issues of abandonment for me that exist to this day.

This is partly why I wanted three children — now my wife can never leave me.

Workaholic parents are worse than alcoholics because meetings can’t cure them — so each nanny’s departure heralded a new chapter of my childhood. I clearly remember Jill, who was with me for three years until I was six, but she detested me and Jessica. As precocious as we were, this only really made sense when we found out years later that Jill and my dad had been having an affair.

On-screen: Saffy, Edina's long-suffering and straight-laced daughter, was played by Julia Sawalha in the classic BBC comedy, which starred Jennifer Saunders and Joanna Lumley

Sue followed Jill and a blissful year of unconditional love and happiness followed, until the poor woman abruptly left after having descended into schizophrenia.

Dee came next — but she abandoned us for Julie Andrews’s children. Yes, Mary Poppins stole my nanny!

...It's not the kind of upbringing I'd dream of inflicting on my own children

 

Susanna, though, was our favourite. Fair, unbiased, friendly, strict. Two years of stability and boundaries followed her arrival, and she’s the only reason I’m half normal. If only she had finished the job instead of getting pregnant by our hairdresser.

Then came 1985 — the year of nannies with no names. I’ve no idea why we got through so many then, but there was never enough time to learn who they were.

Stability, of a sort, was found in the massive form of Kiwi rugby player Kim late that year. But she was fired after hitting me for breaking her Melissa Etheridge cassette. My dad sacked her on the spot with the simultaneously comforting and unsettling words: ‘The only person who gets to hit my children is me.’

I remember thinking how gallant he was to protect me, because she could so easily have taken him.

So nannies came and nannies went and I don’t believe I was at all unhappy. This home life was my reality and I didn’t know any different.

All this changed when I visited my friend Jimmy’s house one day after school in 1986 when I was ten. I was mesmerised by his mother standing in their kitchen, making us a sandwich.

My little brain couldn’t compute what was happening. Why was his mother home in the afternoon?

Why was she asking what we wanted? Why was she doing it herself? Had I gone to heaven?

Eccentric: Lynne Franks now relishes the job of being a grandmother, her son says

These seemed to be the dominant archetypes of femininity I was exposed to during the Eighties: docile housewife or career woman.

My mother, ever ahead of the curve, was the most extreme version of the latter.

My parents worked hard. They played hard. But they didn’t parent hard. I don’t think it’s helpful to look at the past and apportion blame.

My parents were from a different generation with different values, reacting against their own upbringings. But amid the desperate struggle to get on the housing ladder, modern-day parents are more inclined to want to enjoy time with their children.

Young families like mine might form part of the first generation to achieve some kind of balance: to work hard and play hard — but with the playing done with our children.

My wife and I share the role of primary carer to our children and we get to work passionately on our careers. Where I’m exceptionally blessed is having my wife to hold my hand.

She’s the embodiment of nurturing and has enough love and attention for the children and to fill my own bottomless pit of neediness.

She’s also a therapist (very useful for me) and the hours work well around the children. I’m at home all day when she’s working.

Then, in the evening, once the children are in bed, I head off to work as a stand-up comic and spend the mornings before the children wake focusing on my writing.

For the moment, our children still like us, and it’s only for a relatively small amount of time that we can maintain such a central roles in their lives.

Soon enough, they’ll be in school and their peers will be the ones having that impact — but on foundations my wife and I have laid down during these precious first few years.

The first person who’d agree with this new way of doing things is my mum. When she comes to visit us, she transforms from business supremo to building blocks supremo.

She still works hard, but there’s now a job she relishes most of all.

The job of being grandma.
