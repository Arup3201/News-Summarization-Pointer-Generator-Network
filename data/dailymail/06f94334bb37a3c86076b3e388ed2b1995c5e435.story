iPhone designer Sir Jonathan Ive has splashed out more than Â£10million for a house on San Francisco's 'Gold Coast'.

The multimillion-dollar purchase seems to quash rumours that Apple's senior vice president of industrial design is set for an imminent departure from the tech giant.

The news comes on the day Apple prepare to unveil the highly-anticipated iPhone 5 - at a San Francisco venue.

Grand residence: Sir Jonathan Ive's new San Francisco home

Elegant: A deep-set portico entrance opens into this elegant hallway with a wooden floor

House on the hill: The property benefits from stunning views of the San Francisco Bay, including the Golden Gate Bridge (pictured)

Sir Jonathan, who was knighted in May, 
bought the six-bedroom, eight bathroom house on one of the California 
city's most desirable neighbourhoods, the Wall Street Journal reported.

The plush Twenties hilltop residence, which overlooks the San Francisco Bay's Golden Gate Bridge and Alcatraz Island, went on the market in February for $25million but eventually changed hands for $17million.

Set over five floors, with 7,274sq/ft of living space, it boasts an oak-panelled library, a courtyard garden and six working fireplaces.

Other amenities include a fitness room, laundry, a gourmet kitchen with granite worktops, oak-panelled lift, grand dining room and a two-bedroom staff staff quarters in the lowermost level.

The sun-soaked master bedroom suite, located on the first floor, features a wood-burning fireplace with marble surround, front-facing windows with custom blinds, a walk-in closet and expansive wardrobes.

Room to think: Sir Jonathan will have plenty of time to dream up new ground breaking product designs in this comfortable oak-panelled library

Very relaxing: The living room has views of the San Francisco bay and includes one of the house's six wood-burning fireplaces

Plenty of space for entertaining: The residence's elegant dining room, also with views of the San Francisco Bay

Time for an iSnack? Sir Jonathan will have no problem whipping one up in this beautiful gourmet kitchen

By the master bedroom a study has 
further built-in library shelving, another wood-burning fireplace, bay 
windows that overlook the courtyard and a unique concealed oak paneled 
wet bar with pewter sink.

Two further en-suite bedroom suites with views of the San Francisco bay complete the first-floor.

The
upper-most level of the home includes a light-filled bedroom suite with
a charming wood-burning corner fireplace, a wood-paneled cathedral 
ceiling with exposed beams, and windows with neighborhood views as well 
as an en suite bathroom.

A 
further room on the top floor has stunning Bay views, a concealed wet 
bar with sink, a full bath and French doors to a sundeck with spa.

Luxurious: The master bedroom suite is located at the front of the property and also boasts a fireplace

Period features: The top floor rooms have vaulted wooden ceilings

Well matured: The home has a courtyard garden, with outdoor space at a premium in San Francisco's exclusive Gold Coast neighbourhood

Sir Jonathan, who was born in Chingford, north-east London, is one of Apple's most high-profile executives and is widely credited with the unique, groundbreaking designs for the iPod, iPhone, and iPad.

In for the long haul: The purchase seems to contradict rumours that Sir Jonathan was set to leave Apple and move back to Britain

The 44-year-old, who was born in Chingford, north London, studied design at the University of Northumbria and joined Apple in 1992, where he has been based in California ever since.

In 2003 he was named Designer of the Year by the Design Museum in London and was given the title Royal Designer for Industry by the Royal Society of Arts.

He has also won the prestigious Industrial Design Excellence Award in the U.S.

Sir Jonathan, who has been described as a perfectionist, first worked on the iMac, an all-in-one personal computer where all the physical components and screen were packaged together.

He then led a design team in creating the iPod, iPhone, iPad and a number of other well-known products that are regarded as having turned around the firm's fortunes, transforming it from a bit-player in the computer industry to the world's biggest tech company.

However, rumours circulated last year that Sir Jonathan was considering leaving Apple to move back to Britain following the completion of a three-year stock deal, cnet reported.

His purchase of a grand new home near Apple's Silicon Valley headquarters seems to pour cold water on such speculation.
