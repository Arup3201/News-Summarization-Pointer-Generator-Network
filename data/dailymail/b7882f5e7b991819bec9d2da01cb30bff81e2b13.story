A jilted ex-boyfriend tried to kill his former partner by setting fire to her home after she refused to take him back when he sent her flowers and a card, a court heard.

Gary Griffiths, 44, is accused of pouring petrol through the letterbox of ex-girlfriend Tracey Powell's home in Brownhills, West Midlands, the day after his attempts to win her back failed.

Wolverhampton Crown Court heard today how Griffiths was caught on CCTV near to her home after the fire broke out in the early hours of March 4 this year.

Prior to the blaze, he allegedly sent a text to Miss Powell, a teacher, saying: 'Goodbye Tracey'.

The court heard she had just dumped Griffiths after a two-month relationship but they had remained in contact.

She said: 'He wasn't that happy and said he was annoyed about the fact that we were not seeing each other.'

Miss Powell told the jury she was woken up by calls to her work and private mobile phones shortly before the fire broke out but ignored them when she recognised Griffiths' number.

As well as the 'Goodbye Tracey' text, she also claims he sent her a message to say she should take her pet dog 'Becks' with her to work and that 'the fire starters are going to burn down' the street.

She managed to escape the blaze after calling 999.

She said: 'I was shocked and thought it was a bit aggressive. Literally as I read it I realised something was going on outside.

'I heard a noise like a clunk or like something shutting.

'I looked outside and I saw something like hazard lights.

'Instinctively I opened the window and I saw him and saw flames from the footpath below the window. The flames were at the front door.

'I asked him, "what are you doing?"

'He said, "I told you not to upset me". There was a lot of thick black smoke at the time. I called 999.

'I could smell smoke and burning and the petrol smell was really strong.'

Firefighters arrived and extinguished the fire which caused damage to Miss Powell's front door and smoke damage to her home.

Griffiths denies attempted murder and arson with intent to endanger life. However, he has admitted a further charge of arson being reckless as to whether life is endangered.

The trial continues.
