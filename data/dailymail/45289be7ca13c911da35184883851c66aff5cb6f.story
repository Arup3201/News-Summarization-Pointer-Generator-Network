Nasa released a series of breathtaking 'Gravity' inspired photos in honor of the Oscar nominated film and of the 86th Academy Awards in Los Angeles tonight.

Among the stellar snapshots in the series entitled, 'Nasa's Real Life Photos from Space' are pictures of spacewalks, the Hubble telescope, glimpses of the Earth's atmosphere, and space shuttles, reports Petapixel.

The film is nominated for 10 academy awards including Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Actress.
