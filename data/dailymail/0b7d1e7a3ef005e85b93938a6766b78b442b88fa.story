A Florida mom says her 4-year-old boy was kicked out of his preschool because of a Facebook post she wrote.

Ashley Habat was angry that her son Will's school, Sonshine Christian Academy in Callahan, didn't give parents enough time to prepare for picture day, WJXT reported.

So she complained about the private school on Facebook.

'Why is it that every single day there is something new I dislike about Will's School?' she wrote on Aug. 21. 'Are my standards really too high or are people working in the education field really just that ignorant.'

Habat says she wrote this Facebook post because she thought Sonshine Chrisitan Academy didn't give parents enough time to prepare for picture day. A day later, administrators told her little Will was not welcome back

The next morning, a school administrator called her into main office — and told her Will was no longer invited to go there, according to WJXT.

'They just felt like we weren't the right fit of parent relationship with the school and that they didn't want him as a student anymore,' she told the station. 'He had done nothing wrong.'

In a letter reviewed by WJXT, the school said that the mom's 'relationship with Sonshine did not get off to a very good start the first day of school.

'You utilized social media to call into question not only the integrity but the intelligence of our staff,' the letter continued. 'These actions are also consistent with sowing discord, which is spoken of in the handbook you signed.'

Habat was shocked.

'Why would you expel a 4-year-old over something his mom posts on her private Facebook page only people on her friends list can see?' she told WJXT.

School principal Lorie Johnson told the station that the matter is private and declined to comment.
