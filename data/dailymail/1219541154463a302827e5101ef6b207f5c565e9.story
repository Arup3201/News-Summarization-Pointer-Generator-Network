Firefighters are advising diners to treat themselves to a takeaway to minimise the risk of blazes caused by cooking while they are on strike.

Essex County Fire and Rescue Service will walk out between 6.30pm and 11.30pm this Saturday and have launched 'Grab a Kebab' to help avoid kitchen fires.

Divisional Officer Neil Fenwick said: 'Using a takeaway as a fire safety device might seem unusual but there is a serious message here.

Appetite for safety: Thinking of what to eat this Saturday night? Residents of Essex are being urged to 'Grab a Kebab' to avoid kitchen fires while firefighters go on strike

'This a quirky way of us making sure that as many people as possible hear our fire safety message ahead of the strike.

'Cooking is a huge cause of 
fires -Â around a third of all house fires start in the kitchen, so by 
ordering in a takeaway people can make a real difference and help us 
reduce the risk of fire.'

They are keen for people who are going out for a 
drink to heed the message. More than 10 per cent of kitchen fires start after 11pm as people arrive 
home from a night out.

DO Fenwick added: 'Cooking after drinking is a recipe for disaster so 
our best advice is on your way home grab a kebab, murder a burger or 
hurry for a curry rather than try and cook when you get in.'

Essex Fire Brigades Union members, along with colleagues across the 
country, will be taking industrial action as part of a national dispute 
over Government pension reforms.

Fire engines crewed by Essex firefighters will be attending incidents
and people should could continue to dial 999 as normal, but the Service
is urging people to do anything they can to help reduce risk in the 
county throughout the five hour strike period.
