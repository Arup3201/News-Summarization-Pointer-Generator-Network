Detroit Lions running back Reggie Bush is denying recently-published allegations that he gave out MDMA, or 'Molly,'  and that he spiked champagne with the drug at a nightclub.

The denials are in response to a Friday report by the New Orleans Advocate, which quoted remarks Brandon Licciardi made in 2014 to Orleans Parish authorities.

The newspaper reported that Licciardi is facing charges for allegedly assisting Darren Sharper 'drug women to prime them for rape.' Sharper was a New Orleans Saints player in the 2009 and 2010 football seasons. 

Licciardi once worked as a sheriff's deputy for St. Bernard Parish, the news outlet also reported. 

Athletes: Reggie Bush is seen with Darren Sharper in this file photo. The two men both played for the New Orleans Saints. Bush has denied allegations he gave MDMA, or 'Molly,' to women and that he spiked champagne with MDMA

According to the Advocate, Licciardi told authorities that he spotted Bush in a Vegas dance club's VIP section and that Bush recognized Licciardi as Sharper's pal.

The newspaper quoted Licciardi as saying 'OK, um, I was in Vegas about three years ago and um, Reggie Bush put Molly in Champagne. He was handing out Molly on the dance floor to girls. Handing it out. Like giving it to them.'

Then, Orleans Parish District Attorney's office investigator James O'Hern reportedly said 'And how do you know that?'

According to the Advocate, Licciardi said ''Cause I saw it with my own eyes.'

However, the newspaper reported that Licciardi went on to contradict himself and said: 'Reggie, yeah. No, I didn't see him put it in the drink. He told me. And he said he was handing it to people, in Vegas.

'He asked me if I wanted some. And I was like, "I don't do that stuff."'

Bush, who was a New Orleans Saints player during the 2006 - 2010 seasons, is not accused of drugging or raping anyone, the Advocate pointed out. 

Athlete: Bush now plays for the Detroit Lions, and tweeted Friday report 'I 100 percent intend to take legal action against The Advocate if they do not retract their LIE-FILLED article. Shame on you!'

Smiling: Bush posted this selfie on Saturday, with a caption that read ''#AdvocatingLies #ButYouTried #YourLiesWereOnFleek #SomeonesGettingFired #GetYourStoryRight #JuicyFakeTitlesToSellPapers' 

An attorney for Bush, Shawn Holley, denied the allegations while speaking to the Detroit Free Press in a report published Saturday, saying 'This is outrageous.'

Holley echoed those sentiments on Sunday, telling Daily Mail Online in an emailed statement 'Reggie vehemently, adamantly and unequivocally denies each and every statement posted about him in The Advocate. We will be seeking an immediate retraction of this patently false story and we will seriously consider taking legal action against The Advocate and the irresponsible writers of this outrageous and fallacious "story".'

Bush tweeted Friday 'I 100 percent intend to take legal action against The Advocate if they do not retract their LIE-FILLED article. Shame on you!'

Bush also posted a selfie of himself smiling to Instagram Saturday, with a caption that read '#AdvocatingLies #ButYouTried #YourLiesWereOnFleek #SomeonesGettingFired #GetYourStoryRight #JuicyFakeTitlesToSellPapers.'

Daily Mail Online has reached out to the Detroit Lions, Licciardi's attorney, as well as The Advocate, its New Orleans managing editor, and the reporters who penned the report for comment.
