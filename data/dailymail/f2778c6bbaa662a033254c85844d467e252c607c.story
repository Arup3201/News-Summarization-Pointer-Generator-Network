Friends of millionaire Oliver Gobat, 38, say he had been living in fear after being threatened by 'investors' in a property deal he was putting together

A British hotelier murdered on the Caribbean island of St Lucia is feared to have been caught up in a money-laundering scheme that cost him his life, The Mail on Sunday can reveal.

Friends of millionaire Oliver Gobat, 38, say he had been living in fear after being threatened by ‘investors’ in a property deal he was putting together.

One theory being considered by police is that money he was using to finance a new hotel development came from a drugs gang who were using the legitimate business to launder their cash.

When that deal failed to materialise, they demanded their money back.

Mr Gobat was unable to pay so they had him killed.

‘There is a lot of talk among his friends that Ollie was involved in a property deal that went wrong.

'The people who had lost their money in it carried out this murder,’ said a friend.

‘Everyone is saying he was in over his head and that it was drug money.’

Police have so far refused to reveal any motive for the murder but said they are looking at a ‘mountain of evidence’ and have interviewed his family and business associates.

The manner of Mr Gobat’s death last week on a remote track a mile from the upmarket Cap Maison hotel he ran in the north of the island has led police to believe he was the victim of a contract killing.

Mr Gobat was shot twice in the head in the passenger seat of his car before the vehicle was set on fire.

A St Lucia police spokesman said Mr Gobat’s death was ‘no ordinary murder’ but refused to elaborate further.

A police source said: ‘This has all the hallmarks of a professional killing.’

The victim’s parents Theo and Helen flew from their home in Esher, Surrey, for a sunset memorial service held for their son yesterday.
