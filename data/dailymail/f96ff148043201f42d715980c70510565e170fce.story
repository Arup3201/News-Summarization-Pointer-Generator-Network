An episode of Peppa Pig featuring a friendly spider has been banned in Australia - for sending an 'unsuitable' message to children that arachnids may not be dangerous.

The five-minute episode of the popular children's cartoon, called 'Spider's Web' features a harmless spider called Mr Skinnylegs. 

'Not scary': Mr Skinnylegs and Peppa's friendship is giving the wrong message to children in Australia. It is home to some of the world's most deadly creatures including venomous spiders

There are scenes where Peppa and co take a great interest in the spider and learn to avoid disturbing its web.

Daddy Pig is seen picking up the spider by its thread within the episode, and saying to his spouse: 'Don't be scared, Mummy.'

Located in a continent with some of the world's most deadly spiders, the decision was taken to remove the episode after a viewer there complained in 2012 it sent the wrong message that the creatures were 'not scary.'

Public broadcaster ABC agreed, apologised for running it but later accidentally showed it online.

A spokesman said: 'The ABC considered the episode unsuitable for broadcast in Australia and it had been restricted from being aired on the ABC's television networks.

Cast outside: The 'Spider's Web' episode has been banned in Australia for featuring a harmless spider called Mr Skinnylegs. A viewer complained it was not the right message to give to kids

However, the episode was accidentally published online due to a technical problem. The ABC apologised to the complainant and advised that the episode was no longer available online.'
