A Lebanese woman who claims she was inappropriately groped by a Duane Reade pharmacist during a phony breast exam is suing the drug store chain for $40million.

The lawsuit filed by Hayat Ammouri alleges that Monesh Hanoman 'sadistically and perversely' pinched and rubbed her breasts for nearly five minutes at a branch on Lexington Avenue, New York City.

According to the papers filed with Manhattan Supreme Court, she was left 'traumatised [and] humiliated' by her alleged treatment at the hands of the pharmacist.

Lawsuit: Hayat Ammouri, fashion editor of Beirut-based Laha Magazine, is seeking $40million in damages from drug store chain Duane Reade over claims an employee 'sadistically and perversely' fondled her breasts

Mr Hanoman, of Sunset Park, Brooklyn, has subsequently been sacked from his job with Duane Reade and, after the alleged assault was reported to police, prosecutors are reportedly considering charges against him.

Ms Ammouri, a fashion editor in her native Lebanon who was on a visit to the U.S., went to the midtown store to buy over-the-counter medication on April 22, says the lawsuit seen by the New York Daily News.

It is claimed that as she collected the drugs Mr Hanoman, 26, recommended a blood pressure test and took her to an enclosed partition and told her to remove her outer clothing.

That test came back normal, but Mr Hanoman then allegedly also offered Ms Ammouri a manual mammogram, to which the devout Muslim unwittingly agreed.

The pharmacist is then said to have pulled down her T-shirt 'and pushed each cup of her bra to the side so that her breasts were fully exposed'.

Ms Ammouri stood with her arms raised above her head as Mr Hanoman fondled her breasts and asked her whether she had ever given birth or breastfed a child, the complaint alleges.

It says the exam continued for an unreasonably long time, which should have raised alarm among other employees the Duane Reade branch.

After Mr Hanoman told the embarrassed editor it's 'all good' she returned to her room at the Waldorf Astoria hotel.

It was only after she told her cousin the next day about the exam that she realised something was amiss, when he told her 'that such an exam was not normal', the lawsuit said.

Duane Reade spokesman Calvin Peters told the New York Daily News that the chain took prompt action after learning of the incident and had sacked Mr Hanoman.

'We truly regret that this occurred,' Mr Peters added.

Ms Ammouri has since returned to her home city of Beirut, where she works for Laha Magazine. Her U.S. lawyer Joseph Tacopina says that New York prosecutors have been in touch with her.

The lawsuit says Ms Ammouri has been left emotionally scarred.

'Ms Ammouri has been incredibly traumatised, humiliated and now suffers from severe emotional distress and other related psychological injuries,' it said.
