Within moments of the Uruguay striker appearing to sink his teeth into Chiellini's shoulder fans were scanning the net for photos and video clips of the incident.

An Argentinian twitter user was subjected to abuse on the social media site as fans confused him for Luis Suarez.

Diego Suarez, whose twitter handle is @Suarez, received so many vile tweets that he said he was considering closing his account down.

'Please stop I am not Uruguayan, I am not Luis Suarez' the unfortunate Argentinian tweeted. 'I am not Luis Suarez, there are many Suarez in the world'.

Chiellini was subject to a shocking attack by Liverpool forward Suarez, who sunk 
his teeth into his opponent just before Diego Godin's matchwinner in Uruguay's 1-0 win.

It wasn't the first time that the Uruguayan has sunk his teeth into an opponent. Chelsea's Branislav Ivanovic and PSV Eindhoven's Otman Bakkal were previous victims in 2013 and 2010 respectively.
