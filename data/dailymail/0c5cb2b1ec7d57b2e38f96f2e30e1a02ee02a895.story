A projector that screws into any light socket and connects to your smartphone could make any surface in your house into a smart screen

Beam, which is raising money on Kickstarter, allows you to watch movies, play games and browse the internet on your ceiling, work surfaces and even your dinner table.

'With Beam we created an easy to use internet of things device that can entertain and assist you throughout the day, perfectly integrated in your home,' said Beam Labs, the start-up behind the smart projector.

Watch TV on the wall: Beam allows you to use all your favourite Android apps projected on to any surface, and all controlled from your smartphone

Beam runs on Android, the same operating system that powers Samsung and HTC phones, meaning you can use all the apps you are familiar with but on the surface of your choice.

But Apple fans will be happy to know it also works with the iPhone with a specially designed app.

Beam Labs have provided a few suggestions of what you can do with Beam, including watching TV on your bedroom ceiling, projecting recipes on your kitchen counter, playing projected board games on your dining table and turning walls into digital paintings.

Beam ships with 20,000 hours worth of projection time, 1.3 GHZ dual-core processor and 8 GB of storage.

Beam is powered through a light socket and is an all-in-one mini computer. It ships with 20,000 hours worth of projection time, 1.3 GHZ dual-core processor and 8 GB of storage

The projector can be set up to turn on automatically at certain times of the day, to wake you up with the weather report for example, or give you social media updates when you get home. 

Beam has a mini Android computer built into it, and can connect to Wi-Fi and bluetooth, so you can hook it up to your phone or a mouse to control it. 

It packs 854 by 480 resolution, but if funding is successful they plan to improve this. 

RoomAlive is a Holodeck-like concept from Microsoft which turns your whole living room into an immersive gaming experience

A Microsoft research project called RoomAlive could soon be bringing holodecks to your living room.

The system of cameras projects images and animations onto the wall, letting the user interact with virtual objects.

It can map the geometry of a room in minutes and provide an immersive holodeck-like experience, such as projecting critters running up the walls to shoot or firing incoming 'missiles' to dodge.

RoomAlive is being developed by Projection Mapping Central at Microsoft’s Redmond Campus in Washington.

The prototype technology can turn any room into an augment reality experience.

This includes games where the ‘player’ has to duck and weave from incoming fire, or strike enemies running along the walls.

RoomAlive uses six Kinect sensors to track the movement of the player in the room.

A projector depth-camera unit known as a procam, meanwhile, uses a wide field of view projector, Kinect sensor and a computer to display the images on the walls.
