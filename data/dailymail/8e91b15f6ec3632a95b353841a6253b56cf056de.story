A female Rutgers University student who died after attending a small gathering at a fraternity house was killed by acute alcohol poisoning, a coroner has ruled.

Friends rushed Caitlyn Kovacs, 19, to the hospital in New Brunswick, New Jersey, after she 'became distressed' at around 3am on September 21. Hours later, she was pronounced dead. 

Today, fears that her death was alcohol-related were confirmed as a coroner read out a toxicology report showing lethal levels of ethanol in her blood.

Middlesex County prosecutors say the South Brunswick resident was sophomore at the university. The cause of death won't be determined until an autopsy is completed by the Middlesex County Medical Examiner's Office 

Prosecutors ruled the death was accidental, but insist they are still investigating the case and called on witnesses to contact New Brunswick police with any information about the evening. 

They said Kovacs was at the Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity house in New Brunswick when she appeared to be 'in distress' around 3am Sunday. 

She was taken to Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital from the fraternity house by friends.

Hospital officials notified police about the death, which is under investigation by the prosecutor's office and the Rutgers and New Brunswick police departments.  

Kovacs graduated from South Brunswick High School in 2013 and was studying animal science at Rutgers' School of Environmental and Biological Sciences.

Rutgers President Robert Barchi released a statement the day after Kovacs's death, which read: 'We are deeply saddened to report the passing of Caitlyn Kovacs... Her passing over the weekend is a tragic loss to her family, her friends, and the entire Rutgers community.'

She was taken to the hospital at about 3 a.m. by friends after she 'appeared to be in distress' at a small gathering at the Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity house (pictured) on College Avenue

'I know this is a difficult time for everyone. 

'We are offering grief counseling at two locations today at 7 pm. Staff will be available for counseling at the Student Activities Center (College Avenue Campus) and in the College Avenue Student Center,' said Barchi.

Barchi said one-on-one counseling is also available and encouraged anyone interested to call Counseling ADAP & Psychiatric Services at (848) 932-7884, or visit http://rhscaps.rutgers.edu/.
