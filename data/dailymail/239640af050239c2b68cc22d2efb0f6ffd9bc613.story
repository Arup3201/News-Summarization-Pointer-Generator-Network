If the final dress rehearsal before the opening night of the Euro 2016 drama wasn’t worth a standing ovation, Republic of Ireland casting director Martin O’Neill will be satisfied things went to script.

Seeking pointers for Georgia on a subdued evening in the Aviva Stadium, O’Neill will have noted Kevin Doyle’s well-taken header, Wes Hoolahan’s invention, Robbie Brady’s deliveries and Darron Gibson’s enthusiastic return.

At one point, Gibson was a tad too enthusiastic and a crude second half lunge earned the Everton midfielder a deserved caution, and the hook ashore from O’Neill moments later.

Ireland’s first win, the first in seven games was much-needed; so too was a welcome clean sheet but worryingly for O’Neill, little was created from general play against the plucky Asian visitors – both goals came from corners.

For Doyle, the goal was the latest chapter in an encouraging week.

First, he jumped two divisions on loan to Crystal Palace; then he got to start, then he scored.

It was a trademark Doyle effort too, stealing first run on his marker to meet Brady’s corner, and direct a header into the far corner for his 14th international goal.

A week shy of his 31st birthday, Doyle isn’t reaching for the pipe and slippers by a long shot, and the goal will have pleased Neil Warnock as much as O’Neill.

It was needed too as the opening 20 minutes was unproductive and devoid of atmosphere in front of the smallest attendance since the Aviva opened in 2010. Those that stayed away didn’t miss a lot, in truth.

Perhaps the new-look aspect to the team was responsible as O’Neill made six changes from the side which lost 5-1 to Portugal in June, gave the armband to Richard Keogh, and slotted David Meyler in at right-back.

Legend: La Galaxy striker Robbie Keane came on as a substitute but couldn't add to his 62 goals for Ireland

With one eye clearly on Georgia, O'Neill held the bulk of his first XI in reserve.

As expected, Shay Given returned in goal for his 126th cap after a two-year absence and there was an ironic cheer when he touched the ball for the first time after three minutes.

Given had little to do for 45 minutes apart from bark out orders and instil urgency into an unfamiliar line-up in front of him – only Doyle and Stephen Ward survived from his last game, against Italy in the Euro 2012 finals.

Given didn’t have one shot to save so his form has to be taken on trust but his vast experience has put him in position to oust David Forde in Tbilisi on Sunday.

Other fringe players didn’t do their Euro cause any harm either.

Brady, after a hesitant start, emerged as a key threat from set-piece situations.

Tough work: Robbie Brady holds off two Oman players as Ireland controlled the match at the Aviva Stadium

With James McClean ruled out of the Georgia game with injury, Brady is in line for his first competitive start since the trip to the Faroe Islands two years ago.

His delivery picked out Doyle for the opener and on the half hour another, pin-point corner was met by Pearce at the far post with a thumping header.

As the ball dipped in at the far post, the covering Hassan Al Ghailani athletically headed clear from under the crossbar.

By then, the Omanese were on the retreat and Meyler, reveling in his raiding right-back role, showed a dash of skill, and vision, to chip against the angle of post and bar.

Meyler was involved going forward to the extent that he picked up the Man of the Match aware – you’d have got long odds on that before kick-off.

After a cluster of second half substitutions, which included the arrival of Robbie Keane and Shane Long, a fine goal-line clearance in the 67th minute denied Aiden McGeady as Ireland finally cranked up the pressure.

Late on: Reading's Alex Pearce  (right) fired in a late second for Ireland to secure the 2-0 home win

Nine minutes from time, a slightly scuffed Brady corner fell to Pearce in the box and the big stopper nimbly created space to stab a left-footed shot into the bottom corner for his second international goal – his first was also against Oman.

McGeady then clipped the crossbar late as on as Ireland toyed with Oman who looked rungs below Ireland, rather than the one place the FIFA rankings tell us.

On this one-sided evidence, the gulf is far greater between the teams than the Persian variety which laps their shores. Ireland are headed that way on Friday, if a little further north, to the Caucasus.

They travel with a gentle breeze at their backs, nothing more, and while they’d gladly settle for a similar result in Tbilisi, they’ll need to be word perfect to get it. 

Finally: Republic of Ireland manager Martin O'Neill guided his side to their first win in seven matches
