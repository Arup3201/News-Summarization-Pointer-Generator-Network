Petra Kvitova will lift a ban on her parents attending her matches at Wimbledon, permitting them entry into her player’s box when she takes on Eugenie Bouchard in Saturday’s final.

Father Jiri and mother Pavla were in floods of tears alongside Martina Navratilova when she won Wimbledon as a 21-year-old in 2011.

It remains her only Grand Slam victory.

Roar: Kvitova is favourite to win Saturday's final against former junior champion Bouchard

A leftie from the Czech Republic, she inevitably drew comparisons with tennis legend Navratilova, who also won Wimbledon for the first time at 21.  

With the omens came the expectation and Kvitova, who hails from Fulnek, a small town near the Polish border, admitted she struggled to cope with the spotlight.

‘I won it quite young and it was difficult for me to handle it. I knew that a lot of people expected something more from me than I did,’ she said.

‘But on the other side, I was still in the top 10 and I did everything I could. I was practising very hard but it’s never easy, with everyone talking about us.

'The three years since then have been really up and down. I needed to change a little bit on the court and off the court, to get used to the pressure, the attention and everything like that.’

Kvitova, 24, is an unassuming character who was still driving a Skoda a few months after pocketing £1.1million for winning Wimbledon.

She has since upgraded to a BMW but has remained with her coach David Kotyza.

After criticism of her fitness, she employed a new fitness coach and appeared to cope with the rigours of a three-set thriller against Venus Williams in the third round.

‘That was the match I was most pleased to win,’ she said. ‘I’ll be the favourite in the final and I can cope with that because I think I’ve been the favourite in every match apart from against Venus.’

Kvitova may be grounded but she has a ruthless streak, hugging her compatriot and close friend Lucie Safarova at the net before Thursday’s match, then destroying her from the baseline with brute strength.

Amid talk of the emergence of a new generation of young players, led by Bouchard, Safarova, 27, was making her semi-final debut in her 37th Grand Slam appearance.

Kvitova is a proven performer on the biggest stage but world No23 Safarova hung tough in the first set, exposing Kvitova’s limited movement - the most prominent weakness in her game - by sending her around the court and punishing her with a beautiful backhand.   

Safarova, the Czech No2, fought hard to level the tie-break after going 3-1 down but Kvitova produced two sledgehammer serves to regain the upper hand.

Safarova’s challenge melted away after dropping the first set and world No6 Kvitova raced to a 7-6, 6-1 victory.

Kvitova consoled Safarova, whom she trains alongside in Prostejov in the Czech Republic, after the match.

‘It is difficult to play your friend especially because you know them well on and off the court,’ she said. ‘I think we were both nervous and she’s playing such good  tennis at the moment.’

The biggest challenge is yet to come for Kvitova when she faces rising star Bouchard. They have played just once, in Toronto last year when the Czech breezed to victory.

‘She was just coming up then,’ said Kvitova. ‘I find her a very solid and  talented player. She really seems confident in her game right now.’
