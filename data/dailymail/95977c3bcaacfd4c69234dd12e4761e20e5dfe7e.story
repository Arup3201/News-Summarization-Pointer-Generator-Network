A TV comedy sketch which shows a blind man groping a nude female model in front of duped students during a life-drawing class has been withdrawn after complaints from the college.

Disgusted students, many of them elderly, were so shocked they called the police thinking the woman was being molested.

The stunt was due to be shown as part of Channel 4's show I'm Spazticus in which disabled actors play pranks on the public.

Controversial: A different sketch from Channel 4 comedy show I'm Spazticus, which shocked unsuspecting art students with a prank where a blind man groped their female life-drawing model

'Duped': Officials at Southend Adult Community College (above) said they took part in the show in good faith believing it was aimed at challenging attitudes towards disability

But the amateur artists at Southend Adult Community College, in Essex, who had paid £300 for the course, failed to see the funny side of last month's prank.

One of those taking part in the lesson said: 'They taped up all the windows and set up secret cameras before the people arrived.

'They then filmed these people in their class without their knowledge or consent to see their reaction.

'People got up and walked out in disgust, shouting at staff members as they left.'

Another student complained: 'A lot of the people who take these lessons are elderly and were absolutely disgusted by what they saw.'

Essex Police said officers had 'offered words of advice to the person', but said no offence had been committed because both were in on the joke.

Linda Nash, a spokeswoman for the college, said they had agreed 'in good faith' to take part in the project.

The comedy, which features disabled actors in mockumentary stunts, first aired as in 2005. A new series has been commissioned by channel four to coincide with the 2012 Paralympic games

Praise: The sketch show has previously won awards at the International Disability Film Festival

She added: 'We were shocked and surprised to discover the filming that took place within the class did not reflect the brief supplied by Zeitgeist Productions.

'We now feel, along with other students, that Zeitgeist Productions had no genuine intention of challenging people's perceptions on disability.'

The college said it didn’t know the name of the model who agreed to take part in the stunt. The ‘artist’ was a man in his 30s who gave his name as Tim.

Marketing manager Lisa Pearce said: ‘We were told that the show had a working title of 'Dystopia' and would be played during the Paralympics.

‘It was meant to be a light-hearted show with an all-disabled cast and a script by disabled writers, exploring people’s attitudes and perceptions towards disabilities.

'They said it would not be harmful or cruel in any way and they wanted hidden cameras so that there would be genuine and unbiased reactions.

'The man, who was genuinely blind and came with a guide dog, was meant to feel the model and draw her. At no point did we think his actions would be crude.

'Given our ethos of being a fully inclusive organisation, we thought this was a really good piece of work the college could be involved in.

'We just haven’t been able to apologise to the students enough - although we feel like victims, just as they do.’

She said following the incident last month they had contacted both the producers, Zeitgeist Television, and Channel 4 to prevent it being shown on air.

Channel 4 spokesman Nick Caley told The Daily Telegraph: 'During the filming of a prank involving a blind man and an actress playing a life model, who were both in on the joke, some of the art students didn't see the funny side.

'So, as a gesture of goodwill, we won't be broadcasting the footage.'

The sketch show, which is written by and stars disabled actors, has previously won awards at the International Disability Film Festival.

It was aired as a pilot in 2005 and will return for a five-part series to coincide with coverage of the London Paralympic Games.
