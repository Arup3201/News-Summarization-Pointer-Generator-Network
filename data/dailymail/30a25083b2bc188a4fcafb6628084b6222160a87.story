Just days after it was announced that he signed a contract with the New York Jets, controversial NFL quarterback Michael Vick's past continues to haunt him - but his older brother seems to have his back.

Vick, who served 21 months in a federal prison for his involvement in a violent dogfighting ring, was the target of a virtual jab from People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals in the form of a snarky comment posted on Twitter.

'At least Michael Vick can’t drown, electrocute, hang, or shoot a 
football the way he terrorized "man’s best friend." #smh #Jets,” the 
organization tweeted Saturday afternoon, after it apparently got word of his new contract in New York.

PETA: Michael Vick is still getting criticized by PETA for his involvement in a violent dog-fighting ring

Big bro: Vick's older brother, Marcus, hit back at PETA for its comments about his little brother

Not happy with PETA's dig at his little brother, Marcus Vick responded by firing off a tweet of his own.

'y’all still on that bulls–t???? Smh #Peta,' Marcus tweeted in response.

The Jets signed the former Philadelphia Eagles quarterback to a one-year deal Friday, and released Mark Sanchez, the one-time face of the franchise.

The younger Vick - who since being released from prison has been a vocal animal rights advocate - seems more interested in playing football than he does with starting a Twitter war with PETA.

'Anywhere I go, or any team, I'm always going to compete for the No. 1 spot,' Vick said last week of his upcoming battle for the starter job with quarterback Geno Smith. 'And I will encourage any other quarterback behind me or in front of me to always compete for their job, for the No. 1 spot.

'That's how champions are made.'

Vick was a free agent after spending the last five seasons with the Eagles.

'I really enjoyed getting to know him over the last five years,' Eagles chairman and CEO Jeffrey Lurie said in a statement in which he thanked Vick. 'He always represented our team with a tremendous amount of class.'

Vick thanked the Eagles, their fans and the city of Philadelphia in an open letter posted on The Philadelphia Inquirer's website.

'I was honored to be their quarterback and took the privilege to heart every day,' he wrote of his former team.

Vick, a four-time Pro Bowl selection who will be 34 in June, was once considered the most dynamic player in the NFL, particularly during his first six NFL seasons with the Atlanta Falcons.

His playing career was abruptly halted for two seasons in 2007 when he pleaded guilty to being part of a dog fighting ring. He served 21 months in federal prison, and two more in home confinement.

Since his release in 2009, Vick has worked with the Humane Society of the United States to help stop organized animal fighting.

The move drew mixed reviews by Jets fans on Twitter and message boards, but that didn't concern Vick.

I appreciate all the Jets fans who appreciate me and accept me for who I am and what I've become, not for what I've done,' Vick said. 'Right now, my past is irrelevant.'

'I came to New York to play football,' Vick continued. 'That's what I came to New York to do. I came to New York to play football. As long as I have a uniform on, I'm good.'
