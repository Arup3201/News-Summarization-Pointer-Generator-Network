The family of the 16-year-old victim in the Steubenville, Ohio, rape case says they are 'proud' of  tennis star Serena Williams' apology after she made remarks to Rolling Stone indicating that the girl had invited the assault.

'We just read Serena's updated comments and we're proud of her for correcting and clarifying her prior statements,' the family said, according to a statement issued on their behalf by attorney Bob 
Fitzsimmons. 'We are sure Serena has and will continue to use her God-given talents to advance women's equality and send the message that rape is never acceptable under any circumstance.  

'We are fans of Serena and will continue rooting for many more championships but more importantly watching her advance the cause of rape victims who are never to blame.'

In the Rolling Stone article, Williams was quoted defending the two boys who were found guilty of raping the 16-year-old.

'Do you think it was fair, what they got? They did something stupid, but I don't know,' she told the magazine.
 'I'm not blaming the girl, but if you're a 16-year-old and you're drunk
 like that, your parents should teach you—don't take drinks from other 
people.'

'She's 16, why 
was she that drunk where she doesn't remember? It could have been much 
worse,' WIlliams added. 'She's lucky. Obviously I don't know, maybe she wasn't a virgin, 
but she shouldn't have put herself in that position, unless they slipped
 her something, then that's different.'

Williams claimed on Wednesday that Rolling Stone misquoted her.

'I
 am currently reaching out to the girl's family to let her know that I 
am deeply sorry for what was written in the Rolling Stone article,' she 
said. 'What was written - what I supposedly said - is insensitive and 
hurtful, and I by no means would say or insinuate that she was at all to
 blame.'

High school football players Trent 
Mays and Ma'Lik Richmond were found guilty and sentenced to juvenile 
detention for raping the intoxicated teen. Mays, who was sentenced to a 
minimum of two years in juvenile detention, was also found guilty of 
disseminating nude images of a minor.

The two friends were
 caught after other students who watched the assault laughed and joked 
about the horrific crime in an online video.

Fitzsimmons told MailOnline earlier Wednesday that he was disappointed by Williams' comments in the Rolling Stone article.

‘I don’t know what world Miss Williams is living in but she’s just plain wrong,' Fitzsimmons said of Williams. ‘She did what many people have done for 
years which is to turn the blame of rape back on the victim. Rape is 
never acceptable under any circumstances. Period.’

‘I’m actually a bit embarrassed for her for what she has said,' he added. ‘Miss Williams could be an ideal candidate to stand up for women’s rights instead she’s giving this antiquated idea.’

Addressing Williams' comments about the responsibility of the teen's parents, Fitzsimmons conceded, 'People do have responsibility. But in this particular case... She didn’t get examined until a day and
 a half after [the assault] by which time things could have been excreted and the 
doctors didn’t test for drugs.

‘The way she became unconscious raised some legitimate questions about how she got to that state, he added. ‘But regardless of whatever occurred there is no reason to allow someone a pass on a rape.’

The assault was made even worse by the fact that it was broadcast on social media, he said.

‘What happened to her was terrible and 
afterwards it was compounded by demeaning and degrading her on social 
media. It was despicable what those young men did,' he said.

He added: ‘I hope Miss Williams reconsiders her views.’

In her statement issued Wednesday, Williams said, 'What happened in Steubenville was a real shock for me. I was deeply saddened. For someone to be raped, and at only sixteen, is such a horrible tragedy! For both families involved - that of the rape victim and of the accused.'

She added: 'I have fought all of my career for women's equality, women's equal rights, respect in their fields - anything I could do to support women I have done. My prayers and support always goes out to the rape victim. In this case, most especially, to an innocent sixteen year old child.'

Williams released the statement after her remarks to Rolling Stone prompted a wave of criticism on Twitter on Tuesday.

One user, Jamil Smith, tweeted: 'Pro tip for @serenawilliams or others discussing rape: if "I'm not blaming the girl, but…" exits your mouth, stop there. There is no "but."'

Huffington Post reporter Sabrina Siddiqui wrote, 'Disappointing that powerful woman like Serena Williams, who many young girls look up to, blames the victim.'

Another user ‏tweeted: 'Seems Serena Williams needs a muzzle. Or compassion for a teenage rape victim? Either or...' and a user called JB wrote: 'Hopefully Serena Williams realizes her mess & fixes it. So many women look up to her.'

The tennis superstar, who recently won the French Open, put her foot in her mouth in the past.

At the 2011 U.S. Open, she was fined for verbally abusing a lineswoman. More recently, the younger Williams sister had a verbal tit for tat with American tennis player Sloane Stephens after the up-and-coming player denied Williams was her mentor, adding that she had never reached out to her.

In response, Williams tweeted 'I made you' to Stephens.

She was also slammed for doing a Crip Walk synonymous with a dangerous gang in California after she won the Olympic gold in London.
