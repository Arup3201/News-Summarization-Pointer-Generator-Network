The former wife of IS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, who was arrested by Lebanese authorities in December, is to be released and returned to the terror group that worships her, The Mail on Sunday can reveal.

According to security sources, a deal that would release 24 Lebanese security officers being held by the Al Qaeda affiliate al-Nusra Front is close to being finalised and Saja al-Dulaimi would be freed as part of the hostage swap.

The infamous female jihadi, now thought to be married to a Palestinian, has been held in a high security prison just outside Beirut since December.

She is pregnant and expected to give birth soon, but Lebanese security officers have cracked neither her, nor – astonishingly – Hajaa, her ten-year-old daughter with al-Baghdadi who was arrested with her.

Al-Dulaimi is now one of 19 non-lethal terrorists who the Lebanese government has agreed can be traded for the release of the soldiers held by al-Nusra.

Al-Dulaimi, who was married for three months to the IS chief, defected to al-Nusra in 2013, becoming an invaluable courier for them while she was living in Tripoli. 

The soldiers, four of whom have been executed, were abducted by the al-Nusra and IS militants in the wake of clashes in the border town of Arsal in August last year.
