Nearly one-year to the day since the scandal that cost Ray Rice his position with the Baltimore Ravens, the embattled football player begged forgiveness as he left the city he said gave his family the best years of their lives.

The statement thanked and apologized to fans, the city of Baltimore, his former team, and even Raven's owner Steve Bisciotti.

The statement comes as Rice plans to leave Maryland to return to his home state of New York.

The Baltimore Sun reports that  while Rice has been a free agent since November when the NFL lifted his suspension, he has yet to get close to signing with another team. 

Rice's career was effectively ended after surveillance video captured a February 2015 incident in which he assaulted now-wife Janay in a casino elevator in New Jersey. 

The NFL lifted the ban on Rice in November and allowed him to become a free agent but he remains untouched by any team 

Rice told his fans that 'one bad decision can turn your dream into a nightmare'

'Dear Baltimore,

This is not a farewell or goodbye. The last seven years that my family and I have spent in Baltimore have by far been the best of our lives. From the bottom of my heart, I thank you all for the love and support you’ve shown my family and I throughout my football career.

'We’ll always be grateful for the love we’ve received from all of our fans and supporters, and for winning a Super Bowl. To all the kids who looked up to me, I’m truly sorry for letting you down, but I hope it’s helped you learn that one bad decision can turn your dream into a nightmare.

'There is no excuse for domestic violence, and I apologize for the horrible mistake I made. I hope you can find it in your heart to forgive me, and I hope to make a positive difference in people’s lives by raising awareness of this issue.

'Thank you, Baltimore Ravens, for all you have done for my family and I. I’m very grateful to Steve Bisciotti, Ozzie Newsome, John Harbaugh, and everyone at 1 Winning Drive. I love you all very much, and I’ll always be proud to say I played for the Baltimore Ravens.

'Thank you. 

'Ray Rice.'
