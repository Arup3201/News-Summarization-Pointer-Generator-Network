Former Manchester United chief executive David Gill is set to join FIFA's ruling executive committee as a leading critic of Sepp Blatter.

UEFA says Gill is one of two candidates to contest the FIFA vice presidency reserved for the four British football associations.

Gill is the favorite to beat Wales FA head Trefor Lloyd Hughes in a March 24 ballot of UEFA member countries.

Gill disagrees with Sepp Blatter standing for a fifth FIFA presidency term

Gill was United's CEO for 10 years until stepping down in 2013 ahead of being elected to UEFA's executive committee.

Last June in Brazil, Gill spoke out against FIFA president Blatter's intention to seek a fifth term in office.

If elected to FIFA, Gill will formally join the world governing body's board on May 29 at the presidential election congress.
