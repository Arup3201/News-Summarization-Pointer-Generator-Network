Thomas Gainsborough painted some of Britain’s most recognisable landscapes as well as some of the 18th century's most famous aristocrats.

So, the discovery of what could be the great artist’s paints has got art historians excited.

The intriguing little pots were found at the artist's home and experts believe they were used by the master.

The bladders of paint (pictured) were found at Gainsborough's former house in Sudbury in the mid-1960s during a clear-out, it is only now that experts are attempting to confirm their provenance

Before the invention of tubes made of lead or tin, painters carried bladders to store the paint that they would have made in their studio.

The bladders were made from pig bladder - hence the name -  and tied at the top with strong twine to keep air out.

This kept the paint fresh and workable.

It is unusual for such a large collection of delicate bladders of paint to survive.

The ‘bladders’ of paint spent hundreds of years gathering dust in the attic at the famous 18th century Suffolk-born painter’s former house.

While they were found at the property in Sudbury in the mid-1960s during a clear-out, it is only now that experts are attempting to confirm their provenance.

The paints were discovered just after the house was opened to the public as a museum and art gallery some 50 years ago.

Executive director Mark Bills intends to feature the historic paint bladders in an exhibition, but only after they have been examined by specialists.

‘We’ve commissioned the Hamilton Kerr Institute at Cambridge University - they have lots of experience in this area,’ Mr Bills said.

‘The paints will undergo a scientific test to date them and to see if it’s plausible that they’re Gainsborough’s.’

He said that the museum is undertaking the work now that it has the funding, but it already knows that the bladders are mid-18th Century and French.

Some 19 pouches were discovered in the attic and Mr Bills said it is rare to find so many together.

‘It is possible that they were a present to someone in the family but to buy paints at that time wasn’t cheap - they would have been a good present,’ he said.

‘There are secrets yet to be revealed.’

Thomas Gainsborough was born in Sudbury, Suffolk in 1727 and became one of the country’s most celebrated landscape and portrait artists before dying in 1788 aged 61.

He left home in 1740 to study art in London with William Hogarth.

After marrying In 1746 Margaret Burr and fathering two daughters, he moved to Bath in 1759 where fashionable society patronised him, and he began exhibiting in London.

In 1769, he became a founding member of the Royal Academy, but his relationship with the organisation was thorny and he sometimes withdrew his work from exhibition.

Gainsborough moved to London in 1774, and painted portraits of the king and queen.

He painted relatively simple landscapes and is credited (along with Richard Wilson) as the originator of the 18th century British landscape school.

He painted quickly and his later pictures are characterised by a light palette and easy strokes. He preferred landscapes to portraits.

His liking for landscapes is shown in the way he merged figures of the portraits with the scenes behind them.

Gainsborough worked more from observations of nature and of human nature than from application of formal academic rules.

The poetic sensibility of his paintings caused Constable to say, ‘On looking at them, we find tears in our eyes and know not what brings them.’

The paints (pictured) will undergo a scientific test to date them and to see if it's plausible that they¿re Gainsborough's.

Once the tests have been completed and the paints returned to Sudbury they will become part of an exhibition next year and a conference about Gainsborough and contemporary artists.

Even if it turns out that the bladders did not belong to the ‘son of Suffolk’ they will still be a valuable addition to the museum’s collection.

'To have 19 surviving is a very rare thing - They are really important,’ Mr Bills said.

Once the scientific tests have been completed to establish the paints' former owner, they will become part of an exhibition next year and a conference about Gainsborough and contemporary artists
