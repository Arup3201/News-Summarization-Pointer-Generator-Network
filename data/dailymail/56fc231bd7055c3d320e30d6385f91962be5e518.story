A husband who saved his 60-year-old wife from the jaws of a cougar by spearing it to death has been praised by others who believe the same animal tried to attack them.

Reacting swiftly to his wife's screams, the unidentified man grabbed a boar spear and stabbed the animal several times until it fled. It was later found dead nearby.

The woman's skull was reportedly crushed by the animal and part of her scalp was missing, according to one of the rescue team.

Unprecedented: A 60-year-old man has attacked and killed a cougar with a spear after it mauled his wife while she was gardening at their home in British Columbia, Canada

Now other residents in the western Canadian island have come forward saying they believe the same aggressive animal tried to attack them.

Troy Haddock, maritime coordinator with the Joint Rescue Co-ordination Centre, in Victoria, told the Vancouver Sun the wife suffered several puncture wounds, including on her head and scalp.

'It’s our understanding that she has undergone surgery and is in post-operative care. [She] is in stable condition and is expected to recover,' said conservation officer Sergeant Ben York in interview with the Globe and Mail.

The attack happened late Sunday afternoon when the couple were in the back yard of their home on Flores Island in Clayoquot Sound, on the west coast of Vancouver Island.

Lucky: According to the Vancouver Sun, the woman suffered severe head injuries from the attack, which happened Sunday late afternoon

The 60-year-old was gardening when the big cat launched at her, mauling her.

Her husband immediately grabbed the spear and repeatedly hurled it into the animal until it ran away.

Conservation officers later found the cougar, dead, about 20metres from the attack. It is thought it died from it's multiple wounds, but a necropsy is also scheduled to be carried out.

Mr York, speaking the the Globe and Mail, praised the man's bravery and said this was an unprecedented case of a cougar having being killed.

'I’m pretty sure that this is the first time in B.C., if not Canada and maybe even North America, where someone has stopped an attack by a cougar with a spear and killed it with a spear,' he said.

'I understand why he did it, but it still takes a lot of bravery to do what he did and I’m glad he was there to rescue her. You know it could have turned out a lot differently if he hadn’t been around, he added.

The woman was taken by a coast guard ship to nearby Tofino before being airlifted to hospital in Victoria.

Other residents no Flores Island have also praised the man's bravery and claim they believe the same aggressive animal has made several opportunist attacks nearby.

Island resident Bill Dennis told the Vancouver Sun a cougar leapt out of the channel and chased him and a friend in June.

He said it went for his friend but missed, then it came for him up a ramp. After sprinting away, the big cat then went for his friend again.

Mr Dennis told the newspaper a schoolteacher had also been stalked by a cougar and so had a tourist on a Wildside Trail.
