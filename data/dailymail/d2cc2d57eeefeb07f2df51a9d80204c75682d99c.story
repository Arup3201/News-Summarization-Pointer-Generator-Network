Guilty: Bursar Sandra stole more than £200,000 from her school to fund her lifestyle including her mother's care home bill

A school bursar who splashed out on a new Mercedes Benz and other luxuries after siphoning off hundreds of thousands of pounds has been jailed for three years.

Sandra Ross pleaded guilty to 23 counts of fraud by abuse of position after a police investigation at Temple Mill Primary School in Strood, Kent.

The 64-year-old grandmother, from Meopham, Kent, was arrested in March 2011 following the discovery of unauthorised payments totalling £212,166 from the school’s account.

She immediately confessed to using the school account to fund her mother’s care home bills and paid back £41,656.27 to the school.

But further investigations revealed Ross had also used school funds to pay the deposit on a £45,000 Mercedes Benz and treat herself to a laptop, new clothes and furniture.

She dipped into the school’s account again to spruce up her mum’s home after she went into care - spending money on a decorator, stone masonry and skip hire.

Fraud experts also found a £3,985 payment to her husband’s credit card, £93,700 paid into personal bank accounts and payments to BUPA and Age Concern for family members.

Ross, who was sentenced on Friday at Maidstone Crown Court, has been sacked from her job as business manager at the school.

She was exposed when the council’s education finance department noticed suspicious transactions in the school’s bank accounts during an internal audit.

A joint investigation by Kent Police and Medway Council revealed Ross’s fraud spanned five years, starting in 2005.

Ross, who had access to Temple Hill’s debit card and made the majority of the purchases on behalf of the school, debited the school account in multiple unauthorised transactions.

And she secretly changed data on monthly documents to the council in a deliberate attempt to hide her fraud.

Detective Constable Kim Jordan, of Kent Police, said: 'This investigation was long and protracted due to the multiple transactions that were under investigation and the time period during which these offences were committed.

'Ross was in a position of trust, which she totally disregarded for her own personal financial gain and she made every effort to try to disguise her dishonesty from her colleagues, the head teacher and Medway Council.

'She deprived Temple Mill Primary School and its pupils of much needed funds and every effort will now be made to reclaim the outstanding money.

'I hope today’s verdict acts as a deterrent for others.'
