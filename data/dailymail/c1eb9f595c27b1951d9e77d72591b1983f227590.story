In 2008, Scott Douglas and his brother-in-law Rich St. Pierre were thrown overboard from their fishing boat off the coast of Nantucket during a horrendous storm, but were able to swim to safety.

More than three years after the Queen Bee was lost at sea, it turned up in the most unlikely of places - off the coast of Spain.

The ship made an incredible three-year journey across the continental shelf, startling the Spanish Coast Guard and surprising the boat's former owners.

The 26-foot Queen Bee is a little worse for the wear and is covered in mould, rust, and barnacles, but its two motors are still attached, the Nantucket Inquirer and Mirror reports.

The word ‘Nantucket’ is clearly visible written across the ship’s starboard. 

According to Spanish media, the boat still contained a first-aid kit, a radio, fire extinguishers, and maps of the U.S. East Coast.

Mr Douglas, 58, was shocked to see the vessel again, and in a different form. ‘It looks entirely different,’ he said after he saw photos of the Regulator 26. ‘That’s amazing.’

Mr St Pierre agreed. ‘It’s a good ending and it’s nice to have some closure,' he told CBS Boston, 'but I’d love to know what happened to it over three and a half years.'

According to U.S. Coast Guard spokesman Lt Joe Klinker, the boat most likely travelled so far by catching the Gulf Stream.

Lt Klinker said it was incredibly rare, but not unheard of, for a ship to make such a long journey, or emerge from the depths of Davey Jones' locker.

It was uncommon that the 26-foot Queen Bee made a trans-Atlantic journey without being destroyed.

'It’s a good ending and it's nice to 
have some closure, but I’d love to know what 
happened to it over three and a half years.'

-Survivor Rich St. Pierre

Mr Douglas told msnbc.com that the weather was very violent in August 2008 when he was out fishing in the Queen Bee. ‘You wouldn’t want to be dumped in the ocean out there.’

But a rogue wave sent him and Mr St Pierre, 68, overboard and into the tumultuous currents.

While Mr Douglas could tread water easily enough, Mr St Pierre had open heart surgery the year before and was struggling.

Miraculously, a survival kit had fallen overboard, the only thing to fall from their stricken boat.

That helped the two of them swim about an hour to an island, where they were able to use a cabin’s phone to call the Coast Guard.

‘At the end of the day, it just wasn’t our time,’ Mr Douglas told msnbc.com.

He now lives in New Jersey and has no interest in getting his boat back. But he said it might make a good children’s book to be read to his four grandchildren.
