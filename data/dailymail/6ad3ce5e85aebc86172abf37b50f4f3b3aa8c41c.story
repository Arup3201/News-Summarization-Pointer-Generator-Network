Martin 'Mad Dog' Allen returns with the latest instalment of his new weekly column for MailOnline Sport. The former Gillingham boss does not hold back with his views on current issues in football.

This week, Mad Dog has his say on touchline bust-ups, why Alan Pardew should not be blamed for what is going on at Newcastle, and why Arsenal could have been serious contenders if Walcott and Ramsey had been fit for the whole season.

STOP THIS TOUCHLINE MADNESS

I may be known as Mad Dog, but this technical area craziness must be stamped out.

Over the Bank Holiday weekend we’ve seen more technical area spats and this is now obviously something that has to be addressed in the summer by the Referees’ Association and the League Managers Association.

Madness: Chelsea's manager Jose Mourinho holds back assistant coach Rui Faria

Losing his head: Faria was sent to the stands after his confrontation with Mike Dean

At Blackpool on Friday and Spurs on Saturday, coaches of both clubs had flare-ups with their own players.

At Stamford Bridge, Jose Mourinho’s assistant Rui Faria totally lost the plot in his reaction to the fourth official and was sent to the stands.

This trend seems to be happening more and more.

The demand for results, the constant speculation about managers’ jobs, the increase in social media networks and scrutiny from the media makes the the technical area more difficult and high-pressured than it has ever been.

Last year, when I was in charge at Gillingham we had zero tolerance to any abuse or dissent towards match officials.

Not seeing eye to eye: Danny Rose and Spurs coach Tony Parks have words on the sidelines

Squaring up: Blackpool coach Bob Malcolm pushes substitute Stephen Dobbie

Clash: Sub Stephen Dobbie was preparing to go on when he was confronted by coach Bob Malcolm

More often than not if my players got a yellow card for dissent they were immediately substituted.

Something has to be done.

DON’T PICK ON PARDEW

I saw Alan Pardew’s Newcastle United play at Upton Park just after Christmas and the team were absolutely outstanding.

They moved they ball around the pitch, controlled the game and were always a danger.

They were competitive all over the park and each time the Frenchman Yohan Cabaye, playing in the No 10 role, got the ball between the West Ham lines he looked to thread intricate passes through for Loic Remy to get in behind the defence.

Making the call: Alan Pardew makes changes from the stands by phone

Money in the bank: Newcastle owner Mike Ashley will benifit from another season in the Premier League

They had pace on the wings and they looked a quality outfit.

Cabaye was their quarter-back and Remy was their wide receiver, running on to passes to damage the opposition.

Subsequently Cabaye was sold, Remy was injured and their cutting edge had gone.

Before then, there was a lot of talk of Newcastle nicking a Champions League fourth spot.

But
 they brought in no replacement of real quality for Cabaye and the 
players and supporters faced four months with no real goal to aim for 
and a comfortable mid-table finish assured.

The owner, Mike Ashley, is £19million richer and the club is guaranteed another £120m from the Premier League next season.

From his point of view as a business it has been a great season.

But if those two players had stayed together Alan Pardew would have once against been lauded as a top class manager.

Off the field what happened at Hull is obviously inexcusable, whatever the circumstances.

But underneath, I’m sure he feels very frustrated as he could have taken that team on to challenge the big boys.

The supporters who want him out, should be very, very careful what they wish for.

CASHING IN ON STERLING

Raheem Sterling is a banker for Roy Hodgson’s England team.

Star turn: Liverpool's Raheem Sterling scores his second goal to put his side 3-1 ahead

Starting young: Sterling was a hot-prospect at QPR

I’ve been lucky enough to watch Liverpool
 three times during the last month and without doubt that boy has got to
 be in the starting XI when it comes to the first game in the World Cup 
against Italy.

The 15-year-old boy I saw playing on the wing for QPR’s youth team destroying the Brentford left back has now changed into an attacking midfield player, comfortable at the point of the diamond.

He is superb at retaining possession, tracking back to help the midfield players and breaking out on the counter with extreme pace.

He’s got courage, self-belief and, most importantly at the top level, pace to get away from people.

You could say Andrea Pirlo for Italy is a stroller in front of the back four, but let’s see how he handles the electric Sterling.

THE WENGER BOYS

Everyone’s criticising Arsene Wenger and wondering if he will get the sack or be moved on.

If all his players had stayed fit, without a shadow of a doubt Arsenal would have maintained their challenge for the Premier League title.

Welcome back: Aaron Ramsey has been a big miss for Arsenal this season

I watched Theo Walcott in the second half at Upton Park shortly after Christmas, and he terrorised the West Ham left back Razvan Rat.

Walcott had him running up drain pipes, twisting and turning him inside out.

And he changed the game with his explosive pace and quality in the final third.

Running them ragged: Allen was impressed with Theo Walcott against West Ham this season

Take out Aaron Ramsey, with his ability to break the line and leave people behind, and Jack Wilshere, with his wonderful passing, it is too much for any manager.Wenger goes quietly about his business, without moaning and complaining and with total dignity.

The man is class.

Last Tuesday, I was on BT Sport’s SportsHUB programme and I have to share this hilarious anecdote with you.

As
 our show was coming towards the end, presenter Caroline Pearce came on 
to introduce what was coming up on ‘UFC: Beyond the Octagon’ which was 
on later.

I was watching in the studio as this beautiful lady announced the name of the fighter joining her on the show.

‘This is the best farter I have seen this year,’ she said by mistake.

I slid under the pundits desk in embarrassment, trying to keep a straight face.The place was in stitches.

The weekend marked a special day in the history of the old Dog.

A
 year ago on Saturday was the day Gillingham drew against AFC Wimbledon 
to win League Two and be crowned champions. It was an amazing, surreal 
feeling.

After a jittery second half we somehow managed to hang on to get the point to take us to the title.

It
 made it even more special that the team cost nothing to put together 
and that during the season we blooded seven young players from the youth
 team.
