Diego Simeone is expected to sign a contract extension at Atletico Madrid on Tuesday that will keep him at the club until 2020.

In a blow to the clutch of English clubs watching the Argentine manager’s situation carefully the former Atletico player and captain has decided to stay in the Spanish capital.

His sister Natalia Simeone who represents the Atletico Madrid coach is understood to have closed negotiations on Monday.

The current Spanish Champions are now 20 per cent owned by Chinese corporation Wanda and Simeone is understood to have been told money will be available in the summer without the need to cash in on top players as in previous seasons.

Simeone led Atletico Madrid to the Champions League final last year and has been on the radar of both Manchester United and Manchester City in the past year and Chelsea before they hired Jose Mourinho for a second time.

But it now seems that any Premier League adventure will have to wait. Natalia Simeone told Cadena Cope last week: ‘If all goes well supporters who love Atletico will have some other good news to celebrate very soon.’ That news is now expected to be confirmed at an official presentation on Tuesday.
