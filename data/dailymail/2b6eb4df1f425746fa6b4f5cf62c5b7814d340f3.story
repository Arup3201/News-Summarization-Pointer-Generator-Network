You have to take your hat off to these chicks - they certainly look the business in their stylish headwear.

The newborn fluffy friends - which are between just one day and nine days old - were dressed up and photographed by US photographer Julie Parsons and her nine-year-old daughter.

The mother and daughter duo crafted the striking hats themselves before taking a quick picture of each of the baby birds.

Cute: This baby chick looks like a million dollars with this minimalist light pink head piece

Sailor: This particular design would work well on either a cruise liner or a yacht

Ms Parsons, of Norridgewock in Maine, has been dressing up chicks with her daughter for several years now.

And they have created a whole range of chick merchandise available on their very own website, Chicks in Hats.

She said: 'The whole process only takes one or two minutes per hat and so we move rather quickly.

'I get them to behave by giving them food and only working with them for a few minutes at a time.

'I am not sure if they enjoy the process exactly. But they do like the attention and seem happy to be cuddled and talked to for a bit.'

Sunday best: This is the type of hat that might be worn to mass, or to tea with the local vicar

Allo, allo, allo: And nor are her designs restricted to fashionistas, as this law enforcement officer shows

She added: 'My daughter wanted to make hats for our chicks. She would pop the hats on their heads and I would take the photographs.

'I make most of the hats out of fibre or yarn or craft items around the house.

'The chicks are easily amused by seeds and bits of chick food so we give them snacks and gently put hats on them while they are eating.'

The adorable batch of chicks were given a variety of hats for these wonderful pictures, with additions including wooly hats, bridal outfits and even a miniscule replica of the headwear worn by the Pope.
