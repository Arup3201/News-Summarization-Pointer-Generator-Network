Prince Charles is selling 45 acres of unspoilt countryside in his Duchy of Cornwall estate

Just when you thought there were hardly any bargains left for property buyers, Prince Charles comes to the rescue.

His Duchy of Cornwall estate is selling 45 acres of unspoilt countryside – complete with coastal views, a private waterfall and a listed building – all for £40,000.

The former slate quarry, in an area of outstanding natural beauty in Trebarwith Valley near Tintagel, Cornwall, features an historic engine house and is a favourite with tourists and walkers.

The site will go up for auction on September 18, with a guide price of £40,000 to £50,000. A Duchy spokeswoman said: ‘This land is nowhere near any other Duchy land – it doesn’t fit – and has been leased to the council since 2011.

‘The engine house is a listed building so any change of use or development will need permission but we have made a recommendation that it would still be a public right of way.’

The engine house – used to haul slate and pump water until 1890 – is a popular landmark and was lovingly restored by volunteers 40 years ago. It is the only preserved engine house in north Cornwall.

However, Katie Semmens, of Clive Emson auctioneers, believes the plot could be developed.

She said: ‘This is a glorious spot for not a lot of money. We’ve had calls from some very interested parties. Plots with a real Royal wow factor don’t come up every day. This could make a lovely home for the right person.’

But John Brooks, who lives just two miles from the site, said: ‘I would be amazed if anyone wanted to develop this land or even live in the engine house. It’s a ten-minute walk up a mountain from the nearest car park.

‘But I suppose it might appeal to someone with a Grand Designs mentality and very deep pockets.

‘It would be very sad if the community lost access. I walk my dog there. It’s a lovely spot.’
