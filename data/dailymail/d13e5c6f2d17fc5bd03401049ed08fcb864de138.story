Elvis Presley impersonators are far from lonesome tonight after gathering from around Europe in the hope of being crowned The King.

The wannabe rock and roll idols have spent the past three days trying to leave judges all shook up by strutting their sequined stuff at the European Elvis Championships.

The 72 pelvis-swivelling competitors arrived at the Hilton Meterople Hotel in Birmingham and have been trying hard not to step on each other's toes - let alone their blue suede shoes.

The annual contest - the largest of its kind in Europe - is held close to Elvis' birthday on January 8 and is in its 10th year.

It celebrates the musical and cultural icon who died at the age of 42, on August 16, 1977.

The grand final is taking place tonight, with 20 competitors making it through to the live sing-off.

The winner will be awarded the title of best act, a cash prize and trip for two to Memphis, Tennessee, where the iconic singer lived from the age of 13.

Organiser Michael King, from North Wales, said the competitors have come from all over the UK and as far afield as Austria, Italy, France, Hungary and Germany.

Mr King, who has himself been paying tribute to Elvis with a theatre show for the last 20 years, said the event was a chance to pay homage to the world renowned artist.

'I think first and foremost there was only one Elvis," he said. 'He was a one-off, his music stands the test of time.

'There's so many different things, so many different facets to Elvis, and his musical career.

'There really is something for everyone. He is loved the world over.'

The standard of the tribute acts competing, some of whom are professional impersonators and spend thousands on their stage outfits, was so uncanny it was almost like the King had returned, he added.

'He is certainly here in spirit,' Mr King said.

Also included in the weekend is an under-14s competition, a gospel competition, live bands, Elvis showcases, Elvis merchandise, Elvis disco, Elvis video, and a novice contest.
