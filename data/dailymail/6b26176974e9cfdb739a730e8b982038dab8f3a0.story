Armed men attacked an Ebola isolation ward in the Liberian capital Monrovia overnight, prompting 29 patients to flee the facility, witnesses said Sunday.

'They broke down the doors and looted the place. The patients all fled,' said Rebecca Wesseh, who witnessed the attack and whose report was confirmed by residents and the head of Health Workers Association of Liberian, George Williams.

Meanwhile, Spanish ministry of health sources said a Nigerian man at the centre of an Ebola health scare on the Spanish Costas, which contains an estimated British population of more than 82,000, tested negative for the virus and has been given the all-clear.

He went down with vomiting, hemorrhaging and a high temperature - all symptoms of the disease - in Alicante, the capital of the Costa Blanca on the south-east coast, just a few days after arriving in Spain.

But the country's state run national newsagency EFE quoted Ministry of Health sources as saying that tests carried out last night had all proved negative and that the unnamed man, who is in his 30s, was not a victim of the dreaded epidemic affecting several countries in West Africa.

He was placed in isolation at the San Juan hospital on Saturday evening and the results of the tests came through a little less than 24 hours later.

Hospital bosses activated the Ebola protocol after he complained of the flu-like symptoms associated with the onset of the virus and was seen by doctors.

Paramedics wearing protective suits and masks transferred him from Alicante General Hospital to nearby San Juan.

Meanwhile, missionary worker Mr Pajares, 75, had been flown back to Spain and given experimental drug ZMapp after catching Ebola at a hospital in Liberia, west Africa, where he was working.

He was the 
first person in Europe to die from the deadly virus, which the World 
Health Organisation (WHO) says has now claimed 1,145 lives.

The current epidemic began in Guinea in February and has since spread to Liberia, Sierra Leone and Nigeria.

Medical charity Medecins Sans Frontieres has said it believes the outbreak will take at least six months to bring under control.

Meanwhile, UK universities have been warned of the dangers posed by Ebola as they gear up to welcome thousands of students from West Africa.

Universities UK, a body that represents vice-chancellors across higher education, has passed on health advice regarding containing anyone who is suspected of having the disease, reports the Independent on Sunday. More than 9,630 Nigerians enrolled at UK universities in 2012/2013.

The Kenyan government over the weekend said it will bar passengers traveling from three West African countries hit by the Ebola outbreak, closing a debate in East Africa's economic powerhouse about whether the national airline was exposing the country to the deadly disease.

The suspension is effective midnight Tuesday for all ports of entry for people traveling from or through Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia, said Kenya's Health Ministry. Nigeria was not included in the ban, which also allows entry to health professionals and Kenyans returning from those countries.

'This step is in line with the recognition of the extraordinary measures urgently required to contain the Ebola outbreak in West Africa,' the Health Ministry said.

It cited the World Health Organization's recent statement that the magnitude of the Ebola outbreak has been underestimated.
