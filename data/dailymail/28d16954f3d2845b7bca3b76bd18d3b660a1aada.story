Zlatan Ibrahimovic has given himself just two more seasons to back-up his claim of being the world's best player after confirming his intention to hang up his boots in 2016.

The striker famously claimed the World Cup in Brazil wouldn't be worth watching after Sweden were denied a place in Brazil by losing out in a play-off to a Cristiano Ronaldo-inspired Portugal.

Equality: 'Football should be played by anyone, regardless of gender, disability or not', he said

Ibrahimovic later told Ronaldo he could have the Ballon d'Or, the award given to the player voted the best in the world, because 'I know I am the best'.

And Ibrahimovic cast doubt on his ever collecting the award.

He told ESPN.com: 'I think there is a lot of politics around it, the good boy-bad boy thing and all of that. For me, what's important is what I think and what people around me think. What the judges [of the Ballon d'Or] think is not important for me.

'I have a contract until 2016. I will be 34 next season and I don't see myself continuing to play at the top level after that. So probably the answer is yes.'

Ibrahimovic feels he has every chance of success in the Champions League with big-spending French champions PSG.

He added: 'This team is made to play in good tournaments. You need to work hard and to have a bit of luck with you. In the key moments, you need to have the small details on your side. I think we have that in our team now. We have more experience too, especially after last season. So we can do it.'
