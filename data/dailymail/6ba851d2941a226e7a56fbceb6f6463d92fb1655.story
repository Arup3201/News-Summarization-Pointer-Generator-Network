A 25-year-old Occupy Wall Street protester dubbed the 'queen of non-violence' was found guilty on Monday of assaulting a police officer during a demonstration two years ago and now faces up to seven years in prison.

Student, Cecily McMillan, was charged with deliberately elbowing an officer in the eye as police cleared people out of the movement's home base, Zuccotti Park, at Occupy's six-month anniversary in March 2012.

Dressed in court wearing a white dress and blazer she was was cuffed and led away as her supporters scream 'Shame! Shame! Shame!' as she was led out of the Manhattan court room.

Her defense team had claimed she was startled and knocked the officer accidentally after he groped her left breast from behind, leaving her bruised.

McMillan, who has worked for years as an activist, was ordered held without bail following the three-week trial in Manhattan. She faces up to seven years in prison at her May 19 sentencing, although she could get probation.

The jury, made up of 8 women and 4 men, convicted the 25-year-old of felony charges after deliberating for a little more than 2½ hours.

McMillan was arrested along with scores of others on March 17, 2012. While thousands of people were arrested during Occupy protests in 2011 and 2012, most of those cases were dismissed, some were resolved out of court and just 67 have gone to trial.

McMillan is one of 56 people to be convicted at trial, while another 11 people have been acquitted.

Bovell suffered 'swelling and bruising and substantial pain to his left eye' as a result of the incident, according to court documents.

The city had evicted Occupy's Zuccotti Park encampment four months earlier, but activists gathered there in March 2012 to celebrate the six-month mark.

Around 11:30 p.m., officers told people to leave so the park could be cleaned, adding that they could return afterward, Manhattan Assistant District Attorney Shanda Strain said during opening remarks.

She said McMillan screamed at police and refused to go, so an officer escorted her out with hands on the back of her shoulder.

When he turned his head, she crouched, jumped up and hit his eye with her elbow, according to the prosecutor.

'Cecily McMillan thought she could get away with assaulting a police officer by shielding herself in the name of protest,' Strain said.

But McMillan's defense says she left the park promptly when told to go and then was suddenly gripped from behind, unaware it was an officer touching her.

Her supporters have said she later had a seizure or anxiety attack as police dragged her.

'She’s on her way out when somebody she doesn’t know grabs her by the right breast, yanks her up,' said attorney Martin Stolar. 'The next thing she knows, she’s down on the ground.

'Reacting to being grabbed by a stranger is not a crime,' said one of her lawyers, Rebecca Heinegg.

Defense lawyer Martin Stolar told the Daily News on Monday the judge committed numerous errors during the trial and that McMillan would appeal.
