DUTCH GO MAN-TO-MAN WITH MESSI

Nigel de Jong was only just returning from injury, but clearly Louis van Gaal told him to take care of Lionel Messi.

Whenever Messi came into De Jong’s midfield area, he was never more than a few yards from the striker, putting him under pressure.

De Jong did well for an hour but man-marking is a dying art and I’m not sure there’s room for it in the modern game. To stay tight you have to forget about being in possession but that badly affects team shape.

GAME ROBBED OF ROBBEN

Arjen Robben and Robin van Persie were both quiet, but Robben in particular looked very isolated. He had just six touches in the first half and two of those were throw-ins.

He has been one of the most exciting players to watch in the tournament so it was frustrating to see him far from his best. He improved in the second half but credit Argentina for keeping him quiet.

After Germany’s sensational win over Brazil, this game was disappointing.  I thought Holland would do well thanks to their organisation, but Argentina were better than I expected.

Both teams worked hard to deny the star men space and it led to a rather uninspiring game. It did not help that the referee let plenty of fouls go unpunished.

That meant players could put in some tough tackles but still get away with it.

SPEEDY LAVEZZI LOOKED LIVELY

Most of the focus before the match was on Messi, but Argentina’s best attacking outlet was Ezequiel Lavezzi. I’ve been impressed with him at Paris Saint-Germain and his speed causes defenders problems.

Lavezzi did well to find space between Daley Blind and Bruno Martins Indi on the Dutch left, but Argentina could not take advantage of the chances he created.
