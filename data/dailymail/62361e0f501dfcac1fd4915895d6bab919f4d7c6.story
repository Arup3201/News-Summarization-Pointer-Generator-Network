A man living in London has been arrested on suspicion of making roadside bombs in Iraq in 2007, Scotland Yard has said.

The 37-year-old was arrested at his home in the north west of the capital by the Metropolitan Police's Counter Terrorism Command and officers continue to search the property.

The force confirmed the man remains in custody at a south London police station while the search continues.

During the 2003-2011 conflict in Iraq, improvised explosive devices (IEDs) accounted for nearly two thirds of all deaths suffered by American and British forces and their allies.

At the time, Senior US General John Abizaid described them as 'the single greatest source of our casualties and the enemy's most effective weapon'.

The bombs were often placed in drinks cans, food boxes and even animal carcasses by the side of the road to hide them from approaching troops.

Insurgents initially used them to stop convoys before opening fire on vehicles, but they were later used the main form of attack.

Early versions often used a mobile phone to trigger them, but terrorists later turned to infra-red beams after the US designed a jamming system to stop remotely-controlled devices.

Insurgents would often use buses or lorries to slow down columns of military vehicles or force them into booby-trapped routes. In some circumstances, donkey carts loaded with explosives were used in attacks.

The use of the devices led to wholesale changes in the way British armoured cars and jeeps were designed, to deflect the force of the explosions and attempt to keep those inside safe.

Iraq was pushed to the brink of civil war in 2006 and 2007 following a surge in sectarian violence, despite the deployment of thousands of extra US troops.

It followed the US-led invasion, supported by the UK, that toppled dictator Saddam Hussein in 2003.

Just a year into the conflict, it emerged that around 70 fighters had moved from Britain to help insurgents, raising fears in MI5 that they would return home and plot attacks in the UK.

In 2005, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the Al Qaeda leader in Iraq, appealed for volunteers to travel to the country to help disrupt planned elections. Zarqawi was killed in 2006.

Both Britain and the US began withdrawing their military forces in 2009, with the last to return home in 2011.
