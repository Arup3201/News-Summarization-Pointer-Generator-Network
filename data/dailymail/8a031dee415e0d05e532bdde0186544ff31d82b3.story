Former No. 1 NBA draft pick Greg Oden has been arrested in Indianapolis on battery charges alleging that he punched a woman in the face.

Police in the suburban community of Lawrence say the 26-year-old was arrested early Thursday on two preliminary counts of misdemeanor battery and remains jailed.

A police report says officers called to a home found a woman on a sofa with a bloody face.

Oden allegedly told officers 'things got 
out of control' during an argument with his ex-girlfriend and he punched
 her in the face as others tried to hold him back.

According to officers on the scene the victim's face exhibited 'blood, swelling to the nose, lacerations to the forehead and nose area' and a flower pot had been knocked over during the argument.

The victim declined to be taken for medical treatment.

The pair had reportedly dated for about two years before splitting.

The 7-foot Oden was a star at Lawrence North High School in Indianapolis and played a season at Ohio State before the Portland Trail Blazers made him the NBA's top 2007 draft pick.

'No weapons involved at all, this would be 
considered a misdemeanor battery incident at this point, again all the 
information we presented to the  Marion County Prosecutor’s office for a
 final charging decision,' Lawrence Police Chief Gary Woodruff told Fox 59.

The station further reported that Oden was 'calm, apologetic and cooperative,' and took 'full responsibility' for what happened.
