This is the moment a car narrowly misses a head-on collision as it spins 360 degrees on a busy five-lane highway.

Dash camera footage shows the vehicle veering off course on the intersection of I-394 and 100 in Minnesota on Sunday afternoon.

Miraculously it manages to avoid hitting traffic coming up behind as it turns and slides over to the wrong side of the road.

The driver then manages to gain control of the motor and get it back on track before being hit by oncoming flow.

Once straightened up, the coupe speeds off into the distance unscathed.
