Complaints to energy companies over inaccurate bills are at record levels, with billing inaccuracies being the main issue

Complaints about energy companies are at record levels amid growing anger over inaccurate bills, figures reveal today.

Pressure is growing on firms to improve customer service after complaints during the first half of the year more than doubled to 22,671 – up from 10,598 in the last six months of 2013.

June was also a record for the highest number of complaints ever received in one month, with 4,124 unhappy consumers making their frustration known.

Billing issues are the main problem, accounting for 84 per cent of the complaints made between January and June, according to the Energy Ombudsman.

Many relate to late or inaccurate bills, as energy firms increasingly rely on estimates instead of door-to-door meter readings.

Estimates that are too low can land families with surprise invoices later on, while setting direct debit payments too high leaves energy firms sitting on millions of pounds of their customers’ money.

Difficulty changing supplier was the second biggest issue, accounting for 13 per cent of complaints.

The figures emerge just weeks after energy watchdog Ofgem warned Npower to resolve its billing problems by the end of August or face halting all telephone sales to new customers.

Complaints about both Npower and Scottish Power doubled in the first quarter of this year after new billing systems were introduced.

Citizens Advice and Citizens Advice Scotland said complaints about Npower rose from 306 for every 100,000 customers in the last quarter of last year to 592 between January and March – or one complaint for every 169 customers.

Meanwhile complaints about Scottish Power increased from 100.5 per 100,000 customers to 198.

In September last year, Npower suffered a computer glitch when they transferred to their new billing system, causing problems on about 700,000 customer accounts. 

Despite the company’s pledge that they would fix the errors, customers continue to report billing issues and poor customer service.

Some Npower customers have discovered they have paid too little for months – unwittingly building up large debts despite making regular payments, while others claim their bills or direct debits have jumped up unexpectedly.

Others complained they were made to wait for more than an hour on the phone to speak to a customer service adviser, who was then rude and unhelpful.

Chief ombudsman Lewis Shand Smith said: ‘The spike in complaints is in part a result of the rising cost of living, but also as a result of consumers becoming more aware of their rights. 

'Addressing these concerns is crucial to restoring consumer confidence.’

A spokesman for the Department of Energy said the number of complaints was ‘unacceptable’. He added: ‘Energy companies need to realise that people will not tolerate poor service and are switching suppliers in unprecedented numbers, particularly to small suppliers.’

In June, it emerged that energy companies were making £101 profit a year from every family – a 1,000 per cent rise in five years.

And despite a fall of up to 38 per cent in wholesale gas and electricity prices, energy profits have doubled from last year alone, when they were £48 per family.

Ofgem has announced that the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) will investigate the energy market to establish if major players are taking advantage of price movements to unfairly boost profits.

The ‘big six’ companies – British Gas, Npower, SSE, EDF, E.On and Scottish Power – have been accused of not passing on the fall in wholesale prices to customers.

Ofgem chief executive Dermot Nolan said: ‘A CMA investigation should ensure there are no barriers to stop effective competition bearing down on prices and delivering the benefits to consumers.’
