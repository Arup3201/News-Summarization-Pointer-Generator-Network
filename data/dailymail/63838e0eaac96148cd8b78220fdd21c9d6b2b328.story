Philippe Senderos insists Switzerland are making no plans for Friday’s showdown with rivals France and are focusing squarely on their opener against Ecuador.

Ottmar Hitzfeld’s team have high hopes of qualifying from Group E but insist they will not take Sunday’s opponents lightly.

‘Our first game is a very important one against Ecuador,’ said the Aston Villa centre-back. ‘Everyone is talking about the France game but we know we are going to be up for it against France.

‘But Ecuador is going to be a tough test and hopefully we can set ourselves up to go through.’

Boosted by completing his move to Villa Park on a free transfer last week, Senderos is confident the Swiss can reach the last 16.

‘People both at home and overseas are expecting a strong showing from us but we’re also expecting a lot from ourselves. We’ve got to push each other on to keep improving,’ he said.

‘With the quality we have in our team, we believe we can beat anyone.’

Ecuador are determined to honour the memory of their former striker Christian Benitez, who died after playing a match last year.

‘Christian will always be in our hearts and minds wherever we go,’ said coach Reinaldo Rueda.
