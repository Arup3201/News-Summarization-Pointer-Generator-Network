Chelsea are weighing up a £12million move for Dinamo Kiev winger Andriy Yarmolenko.

Although Russian born, the 24-year-old is one of the stars of Ukraine's national side along with Liverpool target Yevhen Konoplyanka of Dnipro.

Yarmolenko is 6ft 2ins, quick, powerful and has a decent goals record with 54 in 146 games for Kiev and 15 in 39 for the national side.

Kiev wanted £20m for the left-footed Yarmolenko last summer but are willing to sell for less now.

He has been reluctant to leave Kiev and but a move to London appeals and Roman Abramovich's connections could smooth the way.

Liverpool have shown an interest in the past as have Arsenal but had concerns about the player's consistency.

Liverpool, meanwhile have spoken to Bayern Munich about the cost of Xherdan Shaqiri as Southampton continue to demand £25m for Adam Lallana.
