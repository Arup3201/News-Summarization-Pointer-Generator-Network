In Kenya's Maasai Mara, it's every lion for itself. Each day is a battle for survival.

Big cats are in rapid decline due to loss and fragmentation of their habitat, a depletion of prey thanks to poaching, retaliatory killing due human wildlife conflict, and ruthless killing by American hunters and Maasai warriors intent on proving their manhood.

In the early 1990s Kenya had 7000 lions, but by 2009, the Kenya Wildlife Service reported that there were just over 2000 lions remaining. In fact, lions have become extinct in 26 countries, and wildlife experts warn that the king of the jungle is in crisis.

The litter of four cubs, The Luxury Safari Comapany's Il Moran Camp, are thought to be under three weeks

But from The Luxury Safari Company's Il Moran Camp, some good news: Lioness, Madomo has given birth to a litter of four tiny cubs, thought to be under three weeks.

The proud mother has hidden her offspring in by a riverbed, where the some of the staff got their first glimpse of them a few days ago.

Patrick Reynolds, the manager of Il Moran says, 'At a time when lions are being persecuted, and are seriously endangered, we have exciting news to share! New cubs have been born for the Marsh Pride of lions.  

At a time when lions are being persecuted, the news from the camp comes as a breath of fresh air

The cubs are hidden in the thickets next to a riverbed, but being so tiny, their lives are hanging in the balance

'Madomo is originally from the Marsh Pride but when she reached adulthood she and her sisters were pushed out of the pride.'

'They spent their time roaming and existing on the edges of the Marsh Prides territory constantly harassed by the formidable Marsh Pride Lioness Siena.'

The cubs' father is a nomadic lion who regularly visits the territory when the other males are away. 

'This is dangerous behaviour,' says Reynolds. 'As male lions do not tolerate intruders and will kill the offspring of others if they find them.

Despite being hidden in some thickets by the riverbed where Madomo was born herself, the cubs are in a danger, being within the Marsh Pride's home range and around 3km from where the pride currently is.

Survival of the fittest: Hungry lionesses crowd their latest catch in the grasslands of Maasai Mara, in Kenya

The world's lion population has reduced by approximately 30 per cent in the past two decades.

Lions are now listed as 'vulnerable' on the IUCN red list, the most comprehensive evaluation of the conservation status of plant and animal species.

It describes the main threats to lions as:

Indiscriminate killing (primarily as a result of retaliatory or pre-emptive killing to protect life and livestock)

Prey base depletion

Habitat loss and conversion

Trophy hunting

Reynolds says: 'If Siena or any of the Marsh Pride males find them they will surely kill the cubs and chase Madomo away once more. 

'Her cubs also face a threat from Martial Eagles who hunt in the area and buffalo who do not take kindly to lions and their cubs.'

'So far she has shown herself to be a good mother but the cubs lives hang in a precarious balance, as ever the drama of the Marsh Pride of lions on the plains of the Masai Mara continues to unfold.'

Rose Hipwood, the Managing Director of The Luxury Safari Company, says: 'At the moment it is elephants and rhino which are receiving a lot of publicity, but the big cats are also under threat - this is why stories of new cubs are always rejoiced in from all corners of Africa, and it is testament to the preservation of the Mara ecosystem that big cats thrive there'.
