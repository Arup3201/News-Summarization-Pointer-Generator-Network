Naming the 150 men who allegedly hired a Maine Zumba dance instructor for sex will mark them all with a 'scarlet letter,' a defence attorney is arguing.

The Maine Supreme Judicial Court will tomorrow consider whether to allow the 'list of shame' - which residents claim includes politicians, policemen, farmers, accountants and even a TV personality - to be released.

Stephen Schwartz is fighting to have the names blocked, and yesterday launched an appeal against a decision made by a state judge to put them on the public record.

'We think there's a really important principle at stake here: These people are presumed innocent,' Mr Schwartz told The Christian Science Monitor.

'Once these names are released, they're all going to have the mark of a scarlet letter, if you will.'

Alexis Wright, a 29-year-old fitness instructor from Wells, has pleaded not guilty to 106 counts of prostitution, invasion of privacy, tax evasion and other charges for allegedly accepting money for sex and secretly videotaping her encounters.

Her business partner Mark Strong Sr, a 
57-year-old insurance agent and private investigator from Thomaston, has
also pleaded not guilty to 59 misdemeanor charges for his alleged role.

Kennebunk Police are awaiting word from the courts before they release the identities of the first tranche of alleged clients or 'Johns'.

Soliciting a prostitute is a misdemeanor in Maine, meaning that those found guilty will face fines but no jail time.

'There's still some of that puritanical New England left around,' Will Bradford, who owns a copy shop in town, said. 'There are places in the world that would laugh at this.'

However, other residents claim the names should be kept secret to prevent innocent people, such as children, being victimised as a result of someone else's crime.

Kennebunk bakery employee Josh Raymond told CNN customers were talking about the scandal, but 'in hushed tones.'

The Portland Press-Herald is debating whether to publish all names or just those well-known in the community in an effort to minimise the damage to reputations and livelihoods.

The local York County Coast Star newspaper is set to publish the full list, believing it's the right thing to do.

'There are people in this community who have had their names dragged through the mud for months because people believe they are on the list,' Coast Star editor Laura Dolce told CNN.

'We also believe that printing the names of those charged with engaging a prostitute is the fair thing to do... to help set the record straight and put to rest the ugly rumors that continue to circulate throughout town.'

On Thursday, a state judge declined to stop the release of the names but Mr Schwartz launched an appealed against the decision.

Kennebunk police have been issuing 
summons to Ms Wright's johns and originally planned to release the first 
names of suspected clients on Friday.

Mr Schwartz is appealing and is also asking permission to take the case to superior court.

Searches of Ms Wright's studio and office turned up video recordings of sexual acts, billing information and meticulous records about clients, according to court documents.

Anticipation: The alleged scandal at the former Pura Vida fitness studio, in Kennebunk, seen closed this week, has attracted incredible attention from locals who eagerly await the names of Ms Wright's suspected male clients

Based on that information, Kennebunk 
police have been begun issuing summonses to Ms Wright's johns on 
misdemeanour charges of engaging a prostitute.

The
first names were to be released on Friday in police activity reports 
that are made public every other week, said Lt. Anthony Burpee.

But
Mr Schwartz, who is a lawyer for two of the men believed to be on the list, asked a judge on
Thursday to issue a preliminary injunction preventing the release of 
the names.

District Judge Andre Janelle quickly rejected the motion for a restraining order and a preliminary injunction to stop the release of names. The three-page order was signed by the judge on Thursday night and filed on Friday in Biddeford District Court.

The existence of such a list has fuelled speculation about who is on it. Residents have said they've heard it could include lawyers, law enforcement officers and some well-known names.

Mr Strong's attorney, Dan Lilley, has said he has a list of more than 150 people who were alleged customers, but that he wouldn't release the names unless they're called as witnesses if the case goes to trial.

Allison Ackley, who participated in Wright's Zumba class, said she had no idea that Ms Wright was allegedly leading a double-life.

'She was very professional. She was an amazing dancer and she held a good class so I liked going. I thought she was a little, not risqué but a little flirtatious, with a couple of the male participants in the class. But it's Zumba. You're there to have fun. I didn't think anything of it.'

The case has rocked this small town, which is well-known for its ocean beaches, old sea captains' mansions and the neighbouring town of Kennebunkport, home to the Bush family's Walker's Point summer compound

'It'll be interesting to see who's on that list because we're hearing that there are selectmen, there are policemen, that there are firemen — people that we're going to know in town,' said local resident Elaine Nicholson. 'So everyone is, like, waiting with baited breath.'
