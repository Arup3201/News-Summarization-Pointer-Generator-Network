Millions of commuters faced chaotic scenes getting to work this morning - with more than half of London buses not running because of strike action. 

Passengers were hit with significant disruption and delays amid snowy conditions after a walkout by members of the Unite union over pay differences between the capital's 18 bus companies.

Transport for London (TfL), which said about 47 per cent of routes were running, called the strike 'totally unnecessary' and pointed out that only 16 per cent of drivers voted for action.

The vast majority of routes are affected in some way, with only around 40 across the capital running as normal, meaning that the Tube and train network in the capital had to cope with millions of extra journeys.

Hundreds of passengers took to Twitter to express frustration at the timing of the strike as snow fell during the disrupted morning commute.

Mike Weston, TfL's director of buses, said: 'I am very sorry that the leadership of Unite is intent on disrupting the journeys of London's 6.5 million daily bus passengers, especially given that only 16 per cent of bus drivers voted for strike action.

'Bus driver rates of pay have been negotiated and agreed between Unite and the bus companies individually under a long-standing and jointly agreed process. This has regularly resulted in pay rises above the rate of inflation.

'As in all professions, bus drivers have different levels of experience and it is only right that this can be reflected in pay. A 'levelling up' of pay to the highest rates would result in higher fares and cuts to bus services for passengers and fewer jobs for bus drivers.

'Today's strike is likely to mean significant disruption to bus services and I urge customers to please check our website for the latest news. We are getting up-to-date information to customers as quickly as possible to ensure that they can continue to get around the city.'

Unite is seeking a single pay and conditions agreement across all the capital's 18 bus companies, saying wage rates vary by up to £3 an hour. 

The union said the pay system was in 'chaos' and had to be changed as wages can vary from  £9.30 to £12.34 an hour depending on the company. 

Unite regional officer Wayne King said: 'TfL is being wildly optimistic with its claims of the number of buses running today. Once again we've seen solid support by bus workers determined to end the pay chaos on London's buses.

'Today's disruption is regrettable, but the blame lies squarely with London's 18 bus companies who have continued to refuse to talk collectively over the last two years.

'To suggest such talks would be illegal is misleading. Are they saying that collective arrangements covering the construction industry or the police are illegal?

'All we are asking for is a collective forum to discuss how we can end pay disparities over a sensible timeframe.

'The bus companies need to stop hiding behind the coat tails of TfL and start talking collectively about how we end pay inequality and achieve a fair deal for the men and women who keep London on the move seven days a week, 24 hours a day.' 

Picket lines were mounted outside bus depots across the capital and there are further strikes planned for later in the mont 

This comes after a bus strike on January 13 over the alleged 'continued refusal by London's 18 bus operators' to enter into talks about workers' pay, terms and conditions which saw two-thirds of buses in London not running.

Bus company Tower Transit said the union wanted them to 'act as a cartel', which they legally could not. 

TfL warned there would be disruption to bus services across London and to night bus services operating into Friday morning.  

David Grunwald tweeted saying: 'Blizzard outside. Bus strike. Commute-tastic.'

Tracy Ismail said: 'Bus strike and now it's snowing, could it get any worse?'

DJ Lauren Laverne said: 'Totally forgot about the Bus Strike. Was standing in the snow at the bus stop like Michael Gambon in Fortitude, except an idiot.' 

Jess Green, 27, a travel consultant, from Brixton, who was travelling to London Bridge, told the Evening Standard: 'I've been waiting for 20 minutes to get a bus in the cold and it's trying to snow. It's going to make me half an hour late so feeling pretty miserable at the moment.'

Andrew Cullum, 55, a lawyer, from Brixton, who was on his way to Monument, said: 'I'm absolutely frozen. I'll have to take the Tube - God help me - which I loathe.

'I am not impressed at all by their reasons for striking. When people join a job they know what they're getting into and the pay rates, so I don't have too much sympathy for them really I'm afraid.'

The bus strike caused havoc on the roads this morning with 2,510 separate congestion hotspots recorded at 8.45.

Across the Greater London area there were 1,511 miles of tailbacks according to TomTom Traffic. 

Traffic delays this morning were even worse than during the previous bus strike on 13 January with the worst congestion on the A124 from Barking and Dagenham towards Newham. 

Paul Gillespie from the London Bus Drivers' Association  explained the issues facing drivers on  BBC Radio London, saying: 'The problem is that you can have 20 years' experience and have to move to another garage, for personal reasons or whatever, and have to go onto a starter rate. That's our biggest bugbear.

'That's just wrong because you are all out there doing the same job.'

He said all drivers used to do a six-month probation period and then move on to the top rate of pay after a year. 

'But most companies now operate a five-year starter rate and one company is looking at introducing a 10-year starter rate which is pretty draconian,' he said.
