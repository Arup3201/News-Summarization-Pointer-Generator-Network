A Canadian father has been left with a heart-wrenching decision as he can only donate part of his liver to one of his sick twin daughters. 

Michael Wagner from Ontario recently found out he is a match to his adopted three-year-old girls Binh and Phuoc, but was told he can only save one of them after a transplant. 

He and his wife Johanne took the pair in when they were just 18 months old after seeing they were in poor health at a Vietnamese orphanage. 

Heart-wrenching choice: Michael Wagner recently found out that his liver is a match to his sick three-year-old twin daughters Binh and Phuoc. However he can only give part to one of them 

Both of them suffer from Alagille syndrome - a genetic disorder that affects the liver, heart and other organs.

Their liver functions are slowly coming to a halt - meaning a transplant could potentially save their lives. 

However they will need two donors in order to save them both - so have begun a frantic search for another match. 

They have started a Facebook page in a bid to find a candidate and ask for donations.  

While the hunt continues, a team of doctors at Toronto General Hospital will now decide which of the girls will receive the transplant.

Mrs Wagner told The Canadian Press: 'We told them we didn't want to be burdened with the decision making.

She added doctors are expected to perform the surgery in around two weeks, but the family are yet to find a second donor.

The Wagners had five of their own children before they decided to take Binh and Phouc in. 

Mrs Wagner added: 'When we saw them at the orphanage we were shocked, really.

'They were 9 pounds at 18 months. So we left the orphanage that day and went to buy two little containers with dragonflies on them and that's what we were going to lay their ashes in if they didn't make it.'

Despite the health problems, Mrs Wagner does not regret her decision.

She said: 'We look back and we have no regrets. 

'We would travel this path all over again. They have taught us openness, they have taught our children sharing and openness. It's been nothing but a wonderful mess.'
