Two inmates have committed suicide in one week at a controversial Ohio jail known for prisoners taking their own lives.

The men were housed at Licking County Jail in Newark, where five staff members lost their jobs last year after an inmate suicide and several other suicide attempts.

The Columbus Dispatch reports on Tuesday that Jeffrey Skeele, 27, died at Ohio State University's medical center on Saturday, eight days after deputies discovered him with a bed sheet around his neck.

The paper says inmate Spencer McLaughlin, 46, died at the medical center Wednesday, two days after deputies found him with a sheet also tied around his neck.

Skeele who was arrested on January 6 for credit card theft was checked 30 minutes prior to his committing suicide.

'I am very devastated,' said Skeele’s mother, Sandra Kay Skeele, 53.

'In my opinion, I don't think the inmates were properly looked at when they came in and when they do rounds.'

Skeele's father Jeffrey A. Skeele, 55, says he hasn't gotten any information regarding his son's death from the prison.

'I'd like to have some answers,' he said.

'He was a good son,' Sandra Skeele added.

'He brought smiles to my heart.'

McLaughlin hanged himself a day after he was arrested on a felony count of telephone harassment and was checked just seven minutes before the suicide. 

Sheriff Randy Thorp calls the deaths frustrating because, 'obviously we care.'

The prison has a history of inmate suicides.

In May 2014, 67-year-old Stanton Deeley died in his jail cell by suicide just one hour before he was going to accept a plea deal for burglary charges,

Following Deeley's death three other inmates attempted suicide, including a woman who jumped from a top floor stairwell.

Both the woman and a correction officer who tried to grab her before her jump went flying off the railing 20 feet from the ground.

Neither were seriously injured but in response Sheriff Thorp ordered an investigation of his jail policies and records.

It was revealed that staff didn't do their mandatory bed checks and that they lied about doing their rounds.  

Three other inmates killed themselves in 2011, including a man named William Overbey.

His wife Christina filed a wrongful-death lawsuit against the county and the prison personnel.

In response to the 2011 suicides netting was placed along the floor to prevent inmates from jumping.

This week the jail added a member to their mental health staff.

'Before the three (suicides) in 2011, it had been eight years since an inmate here had committed suicide, and it’s not like we were doing something then that we’re not doing now,' Thorp said.

'But one is too many, and it’s our job and our goal to find a way to stop this.'
