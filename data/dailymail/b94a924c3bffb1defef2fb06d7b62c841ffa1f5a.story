A couple who have sung to their daughter with Down’s syndrome every day since she was born say she has now progressed further than some of her mainstream school peers.

Simon and Jo Kent even sang to seven-year-old Evie when she was in the womb and say she is now more than a year ahead in reading.

The pair, from Portsmouth, Hampshire, continually play music at home and have always used songs and adapted nursery rhymes to help Evie in everyday life.

Remarkable: Simon and Jo Kent even sang to seven-year-old Evie when she was in the womb and say she is now more than a year ahead in reading

Evie uses singing to learn her spellings and maths and has the reading age of eight-and-a-half.

Mr Kent, 35, an accountant, said: 'Evie's even ahead of some of her peers at school when it comes to reading and literacy.

'We have bombarded her with music since the day she was born.

'In fact, we even played Mozart to her when she was in Jo’s tummy. We read that music can stimulate the brain, so we have always sung to her.'

He added: 'When she was little, we would sing instructions to help her get dressed or washed or to help her get to sleep and it has really helped with her development.

'Evie loves school, is fully integrated 
into school life and has many friends. The teachers are impressed with 
her development and she should continue to do well.'

Determined: Mr and Mrs Kent discovered that Evie would be born with Down¿s Syndrome at her 20-week scan. Their research revealed that singing could help their daughter

Happy: Mr Kent said: 'Evie's even ahead of some of her peers at school when it comes to reading and literacy'

Mr and Mrs Kent, who also have a 
four-month-old baby called Ethan, discovered that Evie would be born 
with Down’s Syndrome after a heart defect was picked up at her 20-week 
scan.

'It was a shock, but within 24 hours we had got our heads round it and we spent the next few months reading up about how we could help her live life to the full,' said Mrs Kent, 33.

'She had a hole in her heart when she was born which meant she struggled to feed as she got tired quickly, so we used to sing to her to keep her awake.

'When she was first born she had a tendency to only open one eye, so we would sing "I Spy Evie Pie" which encouraged her to open both eyes.

Close: Evie with her father, Simon. Her parents adapted nursery rhymes or sang new lyrics to pop songs to help Evie do everything from getting dressed to potty training

'We have always had music on in the 
house and before she could speak, Evie would wibble wobble her body if 
she wanted a song. She can always recognise a tune in seconds.'

The
 couple adapted nursery rhymes or sang new lyrics to pop songs to help 
Evie do everything from getting dressed to potty training.

They
 sang rock band Queen’s hit ‘Bicycle Race’ when she was having physio on
 her legs and ‘Hands up, baby hands up’ when they wanted to put her 
jumper on.

Musical: Evie also loves to sing and play on her father's keyboard

Mrs Kent, who is a speech therapist, added: 'Evie’s speech and language is very strong and it’s unusual for someone with Down’s Syndrome to have such good auditory skills.

'She is very good at phonics which are used to teach reading and I think all the rhyming, music and rhythm work we have done with her has really helped.'

Music is now Evie’s favourite lesson at school and she loves singing in school assemblies.

Mr Kent  who is also a singer and 
songwriter, has even featured her keyboard 'plonking' on his latest 
album, Dreams and Memories.

Sing-a-long: Music is now Evie's favourite lesson at school and she loves singing in school assemblies

He said: 'She loves messing around on the keyboard in the studio, so I decided to include her plonking. She knows all my songs off by heart.'

Joe Hall, campaigns manager at disability charity Scope said: “Evie’s story is a reminder that being disabled doesn’t have to be a barrier to achieving your full potential in life.

'It’s fantastic to hear that she’s doing so well, and we wish Evie and her family continued success.

'Their achievements will inspire other families with disabled children to find the support that works best for them.'
