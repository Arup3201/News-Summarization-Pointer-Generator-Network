A photographer is challenging society's views about what makes a glamorous model by transforming real women into beautiful pin-ups.

San Francisco native Sophie Spinelle founded Shameless Photography in 2009, with the aim of helping women to 'feel safe, beautiful, and empowered' and has since photographed dozens of subjects. 

'Doing this work has transformed my life,' Ms Spinelle told The Huffington Post. 'I've met the most amazing people, and they've been brave enough to share their fears and dreams with me, and to have that become part of the photographs.

Iconic imagery: Photographer Sophie Spinelle wants women to be able to embrace their bodies and find their own beauty during their shoots

Fire power: During each photoshoot, the women get the chance to have their hair and make-up done professionally 

Beautiful people: Ms Spinelle says that too many women 'have no idea' how amazing they are

'I've learned how rare confidence really is, and how precious. 

'You'd be amazed how many truly beautiful people have no idea that they're beautiful, and it has a huge affect on what they feel is possible for their lives.' 

The Harvard graduate hopes that her photographs will inspire other women to embrace their own beauty, rather than shying away from the cameras or the spotlight. 

She insists that nobody should not feel as though models and actors are the only people allowed to enjoy the limelight, and during each shoot, she encourages her subjects to embrace an aspect of role play and fantasy.

'The tools of makeup, lighting, and photography can create images that are part fantasy, part reality,' she explains on her website. 

'It is a powerful thing to enter the realm of fantasy, and to know that you can do so whenever you choose. No model or movie star owns the realm of fantasy - we all do. 

Anything is possible: The Shameless Photography team have worked with women from all over the world on a variety of stunning images

Be yourself: The pin-up shoots are aimed at inspiring women to embrace their own bodies and their own beauty, rather than aspiring to look like someone else

Fantasy v reality: According to Ms Spinelle, a lot of women feel that actors and models are the only people who can have fun with fantasy or role play. She wants to change that perception

The perfect bombshell: Ms Spinelle explains on her website that everyone, 'no matter what shape, size, age, color, or ability' can be a model

'In some small way, we hope that our business can help women to feel more empowered and embodied - and to see femininity as a space of play and possibility rather than shame.'

So in order to ensure that every model feels entirely comfortable and confident during their shoot, Ms Spinelle and her team offer a variety of additional services to help each and every person truly step into the pin-up role. 

'We’re in this to prove that you can be a bombshell, no matter what shape, size, age, color, or ability,' the website adds.

'We’re here to help every step of the way - from wardrobe to makeup to hair styling to pose and expression coaching - so that you can see your own beauty more clearly.'

Shameless Photography also operates an annual Love Your Body contest, which is currently in its fourth year. 

The competition sees women from around the world writing love letters to their own bodies, which are then posted onto the company's Facebook page, in the hopes of winning the chance to take part in a Shameless photoshoot.

During the past three years, the team have had letters from a number of different women, all from different walks of life, from cancer survivors to pole dancers, rape victims to trans women.

Last year's winner, Amber McDonald, described in her letter her ongoing struggle to try and embrace and love her body for what it - instead of always comparing it to someone that she felt was better or more beautiful than her. 

'Dear Body,' she wrote at the start of her letter. 'You have not always been easy to love. 

'Or rather, others have not always made it easy to love you.

'You were always too tall, too round, and too fat.' 

Her letter ended on a positive note however, as she remarked the ways in which she has slowly learned to appreciate her own body for what it is. 

Be proud: Ms Spinelle and her team want the women to feel confident and happy about themselves

Age is just a number: The Shameless Photography team have worked with women of all ages, shapes and sizes

I'm a survivor: The company's Love Your Body competition sees entries from women around the world, including cancer survivors, rape victims and trans women

Strength is beauty: Ms Spinelle admits that confidence is a 'rare and precious' thing 

'It took some time, Body, but I see that, yes, you are tall and round and fat, and you are everything I need to be. 

'...I understand, too, that it does not require a sickness to love you. 

'People may admire you, Body, for you are beautiful and capable of amazing things. 

'I am sorry it took me so long to know and love you in this way, but you are tougher than you appear, and you waited for me to come around.' 

The roller derby fan credited her discovery of the sport with helping her to realize how powerful her body is - and how strong and effective it is when it comes to competing alongside her team. 

'These women, some with bodies just like you, gave themselves names like "Rhino-Might",' she added. 'They told us to "get low" and, amazingly, to "be big". And our wounds began to heal.'
