Diego Costa has defended his fighting mentality as the Chelsea striker gets set to make his return after serving a ban for stamping on Emre Can.

Costa was slapped with the three-match ban for violent conduct during the Capital One Cup semi-final win against Liverpool last month.

The Spanish international will return to the Chelsea squad for the Champions League last-16 clash against PSG next week - and it looks as if there will be no change to his strong approach.

Costa told Sport Magazine: 'If you check my records, you will find out that I’ve never caused a bad injury to any player. The bottom line is that sometimes the little things I do on the pitch provoke exaggerated reactions. 

'But if you rewind a bit and go through what they did to me, you may have another point of view.

'I consider myself a player who fights and gives everything on the pitch. Those who know me and appreciate those values understand what I say.'

In turn, Costa feels that he has had to make adjustments to deal with the treatment coming his way in English football.

Costa said: 'I am getting used to getting kicked more than before. Premier League defenders are really strong and physical.

'In England, the referees don’t call many fouls, as opposed to Spanish football. Consequently, you must be really strong all through the 90 minutes.

'Some of the kicks I suffer in England would be punished with a red card in Spain. My challenges on the ball are strong but noble at the same time.'

Costa has made quite an impact in England, scoring 17 goals in 19 Premier League matches since his arrival from Atletico Madrid last summer.

And he paid tribute to manager Mourinho, saying he has learnt ‘many things’ from the Blues boss.

Costa said: 'We all know that he’s among the best managers in the world. When you arrive in a team with a manager like him, you try to spot every single thing you can learn from him.

'Every manager has a different way of reading the game. In regards to Jose Mourinho, he is a clever manager who spots very well the opponent’s virtues and weaknesses. Our training sessions are based on that.'
