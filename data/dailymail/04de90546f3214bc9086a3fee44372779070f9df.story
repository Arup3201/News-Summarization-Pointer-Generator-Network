Louis van Gaal could hand Manchester United debuts to four summer signings on Sunday in an unprecedented revamp of the Old Trafford side.

The Dutch boss will call upon Marcos Rojo, Daley Blind, Luke Shaw and Radamel Falcao as he seeks his first Premier League win against QPR.

But Phil Jones is likely to miss at least a fortnight with a hamstring injury sustained on England duty.

Record £59.7million signing Angel Di Maria is set for his first appearance at Old Trafford after making his debut in the goalless draw at Burnley.

And Van Gaal will be able to give £27m teenager Luke Shaw his first competitive appearance in a United shirt after he suffered a pre-season hamstring injury.

Argentinian international Rojo is also eligible after his UK visa and work permit applications were granted this week.

Blind and Falcao are expected to be unveiled by United on Thursday and could also feature.

Falcao could link up with Wayne Rooney and Robin van Persie in a fearsome front three.

United have scored only two goals in their three Premier League games to date but with midfielder Ander Herrera and right-back Rafael also declaring themselves fit, Van Gaal will be able to pick a team close to full strength that he hopes will challenge for a top-four finish.

Vice-chairman Ed Woodward will be quizzed on the unprecedented summer spend when United release their annual financial figures today.

The debt level will be around £350m and there is likely to be investor concern at the club’s debt to profit ratio despite record revenues of £430m.

Money: British-record signing Angel di Maria is one of four players United splashed a total of £96million on
