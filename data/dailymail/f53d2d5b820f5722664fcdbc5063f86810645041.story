There is little argument that Facebook has become part of the fabric of social interaction over the past few years.

From a forum to share photos and events to a way to reconnect with old friends, there are many positives to the social networking phenomenon, however it also has the ability to drive many of its users mad.

Hundreds of new digital social faux pas and annoyances have emerged from Facebook, and vlogger Emily Hartridge, with the help of radio presenter and friend Christian Williams, has identified ten of the worst offenders in her latest video.

Emily tackles the downsides of the ever present Facebook in her latest video, complete with her signature comic sketches

1.    Couples who feel the need to broadcast their love for each other…every day

Whether you are single or loved up yourself, the irritation of couples who post updates on every (perfectly sickening) stage of their relationship is universal.

Emily points out: ‘Ok, you’re in love, but I don’t need to be reminded how in love you are everyday on Facebook.’

2.    People pretend to lead the perfect life

While we all might be guilty of it to some degree, the filtering of life’s highs and lows to leave only posed, smiling faces in fabulous surroundings can begin to grate after one or two scrolls through your news feed.

While you might feel anything but happy (left) your Facebook page will still display your life as perfect (right)

3.    It provides a platform for people to brag

An extension of reason two, Facebook also provides a platform for those who, not content with merely implying their life is perfect, feel the need to specifically announce it.

You might have a dream job, a loving husband and two perfect children at the moment, but as Emily points out: ‘You know what, not everyone’s life is that perfect right now, so you’re just rubbing your perfect life in our faces.’

4.    Facebook causes a ridiculous number of arguments

From ‘liking’ the wrong status, accepting a friend request from a friend’s enemy, to the minefield of ‘relationship status’, Facebook causes  arguments at an astonishing rate.

Ironically, since it is ultimately designed as a social network to bring people together, Facebook  now causes arguments that prior to its existence, simply would not have happened.

5.    People have personal conversations on it for all to see

A perfect way to indulge your nosy side - or end up feeling very left out - is to go on Facebook. People continue to have private discussions out in the very open forum of the ‘wall’, perfectly aware that their plans to meet up or holiday in-jokes can be read by all their friends.

6.    Tagging when performed by anyone but yourself

Probably the most universally annoying thing about Facebook is the ‘tagging’ function on photos. From drunken nights you’d rather forget, to angles that make you look like a portly gargoyle, everyone will have been tagged in a unflattering photo.

Emily puts it well when she says: ‘Tagging, it’s a dangerous game when you’re not in control.’

Facebook causes what may seem ridiculous, but yet are very real, arguments

7.    Whenever the weather reaches an extreme, everyone feels the need to post it

Come sun, rain or snow, one thing that can be relied upon in the unstable British weather is that people will post about it on Facebook. This despite the fact that we all will be experiencing exactly the same inclement or pleasant climate – for real.

8.    Attention seekers can go to town with cryptic and depressing statuses

Facebook provides a platform like no other for those who wish to illicit a reaction and glean attention from their friends.

We all know they want you to ask what's wrong and offer sympathy, but whether or not they are actually sad/depressed/ in crisis, Facebook is not he forum to publicise it.

The perils of tagged photographs is demonstrated by Emily's friend, and Capital FM radio presenter Christian Williams

9.    The new ‘seen’ button means you can no longer pretend to have not read messages

Yet another social faux pas created by Facebook, the ‘seen’ button meaning that sidestepping invitations you’d rather miss or awkward messages you would rather avoid has become much more difficult .

10.    Your only options when someone adds you are ‘confirm’ and ‘not now’

Emily sums this annoyance up best when  she says: ‘Why do I have a choice of ‘not now’? Where is the ‘never’ button?!’
