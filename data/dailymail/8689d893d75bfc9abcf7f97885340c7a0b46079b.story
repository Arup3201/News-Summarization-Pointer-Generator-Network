Hollywood producer Brian Grazer is set to marry for a fourth time after getting engaged to girlfriend Veronica Smiley, who once dated funnyman John Cleese.

Oscar-winner Grazer, 62, is reported to have popped the question on the roof of the Huntley Hotel in Santa Monica, California on Saturday evening.

But the proposal almost ended in disaster when Grazer misplaced the ring just moments before he hoped to present it to his bride-to-be.

‘Somehow, the ring fell out of Brian's pocket. After a frantic search he found it, but only because it was such a big diamond, it didn't fall through the slats on the wooden floor,’ a source told the New York Post.

Smiley, 40, who is chief marketing officer of hotel management company SBE, has accepted and the couple are now planning their wedding.

She is a former girlfriend of British funnyman John Cleese, who she met at The Regency Hotel in New York in 2008.

The pair dated for several months in 2008 during which they traveled to Switzerland and Italy together.

Grazer has been married three times before; to Theresa McKay in 1972, to Corki Corman in 1982 and to screenwriter Gigi Levangie in 1997. He has three sons and a daughter.

In 2011 Grazer got engaged to Vietnamese concert pianist and artist Nguyễn Thị Châu Giang, but the couple split before getting married.

The Hollywood überproducer has worked on a huge number of successful movies, particularly in partnership with director Ron Howard.

The pair co-founded Imagine Entertainment in 1986 and their films have grossed over $13 billion.

Grazer has been nominated for four Academy Awards and in 2002 he and Ron Howard won an Oscar for Best Picture for A Beautiful Mind
