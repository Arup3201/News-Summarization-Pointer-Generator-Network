The Super Isa, which was one of George Osborne's flagship announcements in the last Budget, is due to be launched on July 1

Banks and building societies are slashing savers’ Isa interest rates by up to 40 per cent – just weeks before the launch of the Chancellor’s flagship Super Isa.

Savers are set to miss out on hundreds of pounds a year as high street names including Lloyds, Halifax, Santander, Tesco Bank and Virgin Money rush to cut cash Isa rates to avoid big interest payouts.

Under current rules, savers can put up to £11,880 into a tax-free Individual Savings Account (Isa) each year, but only half of this can be in cash – the rest must be made up of stocks and shares.

But the new super-charged Isa – to be launched on July 1 – will allow savers to put in up to £15,000 cash a year. It will also be made easier to transfer balances from one ISA to another. The policy was one of the George Osborne’s flagship announcements in the last Budget.

However, just three weeks before it launches, banks and building societies are pushing down rates to avoid paying extra interest on the new bigger allowance.

Around 16million people hold cash Isas. Around 2.7million invest only in share Isas and 4.4million have savings in both.

Lloyds Bank has chopped the rate by a fifth for new savers, cutting its easy-access Cash Isa Saver from 1.25 per cent to 1 per cent. On Monday, rival Santander will slash interest on its two-year fixed rate cash Isa Saver to 1.5 per cent. Just weeks ago, it was 2 per cent.

Payouts are falling even more sharply at Leeds Building Society. It now pays new savers opening an account just 0.75 per cent, down from 1.25 per cent – so someone who saved the full £15,000 in a Super Isa for a year would get  just £112.50 in annual interest.

Others to cut rates for new savers include BM Savings, part of the Lloyds Banking Group, and Ipswich Building Society.

Dr Ros Altmann, a savings expert and former Downing Street adviser, said: ‘This outrageous behaviour shows how, once again, savers are being hung out to dry.

‘Savers have been suffering for five years since base rate had to be cut because of banks’ behaviour. And now here they are again – still being made to pay in the shape of rate cuts for their Isa savings.’

The rate-cutting has left millions of savers who are sitting on their cash waiting for a top Super Isa deal in limbo – often earning a paltry rate of less than 1 per cent.

Figures from the Bank of England showed that sums held in cash Isa deposits in April, usually the biggest month for attracting new money, fell by a record £2.8billion to £226billion.

Part of the problem for savers is that banks and building societies don’t want to be at the top of Best Buys tables as it means they will attract funds they don’t want.

Having lots of savers costs banks money because they must pay them interest. This has increasingly led to a race to the bottom of the savings tables.

Additionally, some of the remaining best deals are already closed to transfers, blocking savers from moving money held in a low-paying cash Isa into a better deal.

For example, Nationwide’s easy-access Flexclusive Isa at 1.75 per cent interest is only for current account holders and does not accept transfers.

Other top deals including the National Savings & Investments Direct Isa paying 1.5 per cent, and Cheshire and Derbyshire building societies offering 1.6 per cent, will not let customers switch in cash from existing Isas.

Charlotte Nelson, a spokesman at financial analysts Moneyfacts said: ‘The launch of the Super Isa is set to be a damp squib.

‘Banks and building societies have no appetite whatsoever for savers’ cash – they just don’t need it. The best we can hope for is a small rate rise from one bank to try and spark some competition for savers – but it just doesn’t look like it at the moment.’

The dearth of decent deals just 23 days ahead of the Super Isa’s introduction is the latest bad news for savers hoping for rising rates.

They have suffered after more than five years of the Bank of England keeping the base rate at just 0.5 per cent – with no sign of a significant rise on the horizon.

Bank of England governor Mark Carney recently dampened expectations of a rate rise by suggesting falling unemployment did not necessarily mean rates would go up.
