A teenager and his secret girlfriend died after he fell into a 20ft-deep  canal lock and she jumped in to  rescue him, friends of the couple said  last night.

Schoolgirl Sara Rylance, 17, was trying  to ‘save the one she loved’, 18-year-old Fayz Uddin.

Mr Uddin, a Muslim of Bangladeshi origin, had not told his parents about his relationship with Sara, his best friend said.

after falling into a canal lock

The couple are thought to have been with a small group of teenagers who were celebrating Diwali, the Hindu festival of lights, in Smethwick, West Midlands, on Wednesday evening.

It is understood Mr Uddin fell into the high-sided lock of the Birmingham Canal, which was full at the time.

Fire and ambulance crews were called with police to the scene. The couple were unconscious when they were dragged out of the water at around 7.30pm and later died.

Last night Mr Uddin’s father Gias said: ‘He went out about 6.30pm with some friends, which was not unusual. We weren’t expecting him to be long and his mother phoned his mobile at 7pm and spoke to him but then we did not hear anything.

‘It was only when the police turned up at about 10.30pm that we knew something was wrong. It was such a shock and so upsetting for us all. He was such a good boy. He did not cause any trouble.’

He added that his son, who had just left college and hoped to do an apprenticeship, worked part-time as a waiter at the Rajshahi restaurant in Smethwick.

Sara’s father Anthony said: ‘I am absolutely devastated. That’s all I can say right now because I’m just shocked to the core.’

Schoolfriends left heartfelt tributes on the internet yesterday to Sara, a shy but popular pupil at George Salter Academy, West Bromwich.

Mr Uddin’s best friend Saif Ali Aamer, 17, said Sara recently posted on her boyfriend’s Facebook wall: ‘I love you babyz’.

He said: ‘The last time I saw him was Tuesday night. We were just hanging out having a laugh when Sara phoned him and he legged it laughing.’

Jayne Sylvester, 47, whose house is by the canal, said: ‘Officers with torches were running down towards the canal. They brought someone up and they were resuscitating him on a trolley.

‘Then another person was brought up, it seemed like ages after. I could see they were kids.’

A West Midlands Ambulance Service spokesman said: ‘The patients were taken to hospital, but they were pronounced dead a short time later.’

West Midlands Police said officers were investigating the sequence of events leading up to the deaths, but that it looked like ‘a tragic accident’.
