After their fiery exchanges at the presidential debate earlier this week, Barack Obama and Mitt Romney used the annual Al Smith dinner to trade stinging jokes about each other and themselves on Thursday evening.

They poked fun at one another on Thursday
 night during the esteemed New York Catholic charity event that has long
 been a required stop for presidential candidates.

Romney mocked his own wealth while 
taking aim at the president for running up the federal debt and Obama 
noted the 'nice long nap' he had taken during the first presidential 
debate.

President Obama arrives for the dinner last night

The two rivals donned tuxedos and white 
ties to share the dais at the Alfred E. Smith Memorial Foundation 
Dinner, an annual gala that has drawn political leaders and other 
notables since the end of World War II.

The event was a comedic pause in a
 contest that has drawn increasingly nasty and close with less than 
three weeks left before the November 6 election.

On Tuesday, Obama and Romney sparred 
in a nationally televised debate in which each questioned the other over 
character and truthfulness.

Through much of the evening, they sat just one seat apart, 
separated by host Cardinal Timothy Dolan.

Obama

As some of you may have noticed, I had a
 lot more energy in our second debate. I felt really well-rested after 
the nice, long nap I had in the first debate.

Obama

Earlier today, I went shopping at some stores in Midtown. I understand Governor Romney went shopping for some stores in Midtown.

Obama on how the candidates spent their free time in New York

Romney spoke first at the dinner, which 
was set to raise $5 million for Catholic charities. Addressing the 
elegantly dressed crowd, Romney, a millionaire many times over, said: 
'It's nice to finally relax and wear what Ann and I wear around the 
house.'

He said: 'I'm pleased that the president is here. We were chatting pleasantly this evening as if Tuesday night never happened.'

Of Obama, Romney said: 'You have to wonder what he's thinking. ''So little time, so much to redistribute."'

Romney said both candidates have 
crucial people on whom they rely during the tense times on the campaign 
trail. As Romney put it: 'I have my beautiful wife, Ann, he's got Bill 
Clinton.'

Romney appeared at ease on the stage and spoke ahead of the president.

Obama followed, noting his soporific performance in the first debate but also chiding Romney for his wealth.

The President said: 'This is the third time that Gov. Romney and I have met recently. As some of you may have noticed, I had a lot more energy in our second debate. I felt really well-rested after the nice, long nap I had in the first debate.'

Speaking about his performance in the second debate earlier this week, he said: I was well-rested after the nice long nap I had in the first debate.'

'Earlier today I went shopping at some stores in Midtown,' Obama said. 'I understand Gov. Romney went shopping for some stores in Midtown.'

Obama noted than Mitt is actually Romney's middle name - before pausing for comic affect he added: 'Wish I could use my middle name' - which is Hussein.

He also made a spikier comment saying: 'Of course, the economy's on everybody's minds. The unemployment rate is at its lowest level since I took office.'

Instead of adding a pay-off line, he looked dead-pan and added: 'I don't have a joke here. I just thought it would be useful to remind everybody that the unemployment rate is at the lowest it's been since I took office. And we're getting to that time when folks are making up their minds.'

Obama also noted that he was preparing for the final debate with Romney on Monday, which will focus on foreign policy.

'Spoiler alert: We got bin Laden,' Obama quipped.

However he saved room for the lighter stuff, adding: 'Just the other day, Honey Boo Boo endorsed me. So that's a big relief.'

In a television interview earlier on Thursday, Obama rejected criticism that his administration has offered a confused response to the attack on the U.S. Consulate in Libya, an accusation Romney has made repeatedly in the campaign for the White House.

Of any breakdown that might have led to the killing of four Americans, Obama declared: 'We're going to fix it.'

Obama made the comments on The Daily Show on Comedy Central. Host Jon Stewart turned serious in pressing Obama over the government's changing explanation about the attacks in Benghazi.

When Stewart suggested that even Obama would concede his administration's coordination and communication had not been 'optimal,' Obama said: 'If four Americans get killed, it's not optimal. We're going to fix it. All of it.'

Friendly greeting: Cardinal Dolan moves out of the way to let Mitt Romney and US President Barack Obama shake hands

Public opinion: Protesters wear Obama and Romney masks as they take part in rally in support of Medicaid funding, outside the Waldorf Astoria hotel in New York

Romney has pointedly questioned Obama's handling of the matter and his honesty about it to Americans. Those accusations led to the fiercest conflict of the presidential debate on Tuesday and will surely come to the fore again on Monday in the campaign's final debate.

The bickering between campaigns eased briefly at the Smith dinner, named for the four-term Democratic governor of New York who lost the 1928 presidential race to Republican Herbert Hoover.

Smith was the first Catholic to run for president and the dinner named for him is organized by the Catholic Archdiocese of New York for the benefit of needy children.
