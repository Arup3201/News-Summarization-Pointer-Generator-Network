The Washington driver accused of recklessly causing the tragic deaths of 17-year-old twin sisters in October is now asking a judge for his license back.

Ira Blackstock, 53, is accused of two counts of vehicular homicide in the deaths of Jeneah and Janesah Goheen but says he simply must have his license back in order to run his roofing business.

To the still grieving community of Oak Harbor, the request is further infuriating proof that Blackstock can't own up to what he's done.

Fit to drive? Ira Blackstock, right, and his attorney (pictured late last year) are asking a Washington court to give the 53-year-old accused of vehicular homicide in the deaths of twin 17-year-old girls his license back

Killed: Janesah Goheen, left, died from her injuries 11 days after her twin sister Janeah, right, died in a car crash. The girls were with another friend when their car was struck by Blackstock

'My concern is that he hasn't accepted 
responsibility for what happened,' family friend Dena Royal told KREM.Â  
'Accidents happen, but he's still responsible, and until you take 
responsibility, I don't think you need to be behind the wheel.'

Royal's sentiments have echoed through the small town since the loss of the girls. And that includes their father Jim Goheen.

'He
 just has to live with what he's done,' a weeping Goheen told KIRO not long 
after Blackstock's attorney suggested in court late last year that 
mechanical issues in his mustang may have been to blame.

Janesah Goheen, 17, passed away 11 days after her identical
 twin, Janeah, was killed in the crash in Oak Hill, Washington as the 
girls drove with a friend to visit a haunted house.

Not at fault? Blackstock was not under the influence of drugs or alcohol. But the grief-stricken Washington community was appalled when his attorneys suggested his car may be to blame

'He just has to live with what he's done,'urged the girls grieving father

In
 a heartbreaking twist, it is the third tragedy for the family, who lost
 another daughter - 23-year-old Jessica Goheen Thorn - in May 2008 to a 
car wreck.

Janesah had been
 driving their 1993 Acura at 5pm on Halloween when it was hit head-on by
 a Ford Mustang driven by 53-year-old Ira Blackstock and was rushed to hospital in serious condition.

Her progress had given her family hope, KIRO-TV, reported, but she succumbed to her injuries surrounded by family and friends.

The twins' pastor, Russell Schlecht, told the station there was some comfort in the death.

'This is the longest they've been apart,' he said. 'One being taken 
instantly, one enduring as long as she could.

'As awful as it is, I'm glad they're together right now. There's a beauty to it. A sense there this needed to happen.'

Troopers said Blackstock had crossed the centerline on Highway 20 in his Mustang and 
slammed into their car. Police say Blackstock appeared to have been accelerating at the time of impact.

The damage was so severe that the girls had to be cut from their vehicle.

Janeah, who was seated in the back of car, was killed in the 
accident while the twins' close friend Alysha Pickler, 18, was sitting in the front passenger seat and suffered a concussion.

When authorities arrived on the scene, Blackstock allegedly showed signs of impairment and a blood sample was taken to test his blood alcohol level.

He's since been cleared of any charges he may have been under the influence of drugs, but faces a vehicular homicide charge for each girl and an additional vehicular assault charge.

Impaired: Toxicology are pending but officers say Blackstock appeared impaired and found this flier in the back of his car

An Alcoholics Anonymous brochure and a Bible were found in 
the backseat of his car.

Blackstock suffered minor injuries and was arrested after his release from hospital.

According to KING 5, the twins sang in perfect harmony at their local church and often finished each other's sentences.

Oak Harbor School District communications officer Kellie Tormey told the Skagit Valley Herald: 'It's a shocking tragedy for us.'

A life together: Twins Janesah and Janeah Goheen were close, often finishing each others sentences

Tormey said the Goheen twins had attended Oak Harbor High School and HomeConnections, the home-school program.

They
 had many friends at the school and Tormey said a crisis response team 
was at the school and will return to help students and staff deal with the losses.

The Goheen family has two other surviving daughters.
