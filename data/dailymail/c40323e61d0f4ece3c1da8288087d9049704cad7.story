Peering out from the side of a house in a quiet road, this bullock's bid for freedom today might well have succeeded... had he not succumbed to the wily charms of some cows.

Residents in a quiet cul-de-sac in Darlington, County Durham, were left stunned when the animal ran amok after escaping from a nearby cattle market.

Police received reports of the rampaging young bull chasing people around the town centre at noon.

When the beast headed towards Tennyson Gardens, police warned residents to stay indoors as staff from a local farmers' auction mart worked to recapture it.

By the time they caught up with the bullock half an hour later, it had been cornered in the close - using two cows as bait.

Farmers and police then managed to usher the runaway into a vehicle. No one was hurt during the incident.

Pensioner Eileen Chapman said: 'I was sat watching telly and looked up to see a bull staring through my window. You don't expect that sort of thing living here.

'There was a policeman and a load of other men running around.

'Then two cows came and just stood around like they were waiting to be served.

'It was just like a comedy. They looked quite demure and did not start misbehaving or rampaging.

'It livened my day up.'

Derek Brown, of Tennyson Gardens, said: 'It is not the first time this has happened.

'It is what comes from having a cattle market in the centre of town.

'It needs modernising - it is too easy for the animals to break out.'

Inspector Chris Knox of Darlington Police said the incident had been contained within half an hour and no damage occurred during the incident.

In November 2011, a cow which escaped from the same Darlington cattle market was shot dead by police after it too went on a rampage.
