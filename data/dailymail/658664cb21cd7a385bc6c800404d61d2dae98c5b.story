As part of the build-up to the start of MailOnline's Fantasy Football season, we will be taking a look at players new to the Premier League with the potential to light up England's top tier over the coming campaign.

FILIPE LUIS IN A NUTSHELL

Luis was so desperate to force his Chelsea move through that he was banished to train with the Atletico Madrid reserves. In July, he got his wish, and was  brought in to replace the departed Ashley Cole, who left for Roma.

Luis doesn't make the top 10 most expensive signings of the summer. He isn't  the most expensive left back, nor is he Chelsea's priciest purchase, yet there can be few as shrewd.

The defender is nothing if not consistent. He proved that with Atletico during his four years, and will need to do so with Chelsea as they push for the Premier League this season.

Already a La Liga champion, he now seeks Premier League glory. And at £6.2million, he may be worth backing.

Ready? Filipe Luis will be hoping you back him in MailOnline's Fantasy Football game ahead of the new season

WHY YOU SHOULD HAVE LUIS IN YOUR MAILONLINE FANTASY FOOTBALL TEAM

It's always best to have statistics to back up theories, so let's look at Luis's from his final year in La Liga with Atletico.

Luis made 32 appearances in a defence that conceded just 26 goals to guide Diego Simeone's men to their first title in 18 years. 

He kept his territory on the left as good as any other in the world, and it is that which has deemed him worthy of replacing his predecessor.

He kept a pass completion rate of 80.3 per cent, made 131 tackles and intercepted 49 times.

Chelsea can be as good as any at the back and, with four points for every clean sheet, Luis is bound to rack up a sizeable total. 

HE'S AMBITIOUS

Immediately, Luis is itching for trophies.

The 29-year-old is gunning for Champions League glory after suffering heartache in last season's final with Atletico, where rivals Real won 4-1 in extra time. 

'Last season was brilliant but I’ve come here to do exactly the same,' Luis told the Chelsea website. ‘I want to go one better in the Champions League and, in terms of the Premier League, I want the trophy badly.

‘Chelsea is the best club for me to do that. We have the best coach and an amazing squad, we have some brilliant players and I hope the supporters will see the Premier League trophy at Stamford Bridge at the end of the season.’ 

But how will he get you points? 

Easy. Two points for every appearance, three points for a win, 10 points for every goal he scores, three for an assist and four for every clean sheet. It all adds up.

Wave: Luis says he wants to go one better and win the Champions League with Chelsea this year

DON'T JUST TAKE OUR WORD FOR IT

Filipe Luis, surrounded by Diego Costa and Cesc Fabregas, makes up a £75m bill which Jose Mourinho has spent to complete his squad.

They are expected to thrive, and it is Mourinho himself who says so, insisting that Luis is ready to go directly into the squad and do his part.

'We have the squad that we want to have,’ said the Chelsea manager. ‘We don’t say it’s perfect, we don’t say it’s the best. There is no manager in the world that says his squad is perfect and could not improve in certain positions.

‘We say we like very much our squad. It is a squad for tomorrow, for next season and also a squad with big possibilities for the next five or 10 years with so many young people. So, I like my squad very much.

'We have bought three people in Filipe, Diego and Fabregas, all in the best stage for a football player, between 25 and 30. 

'They are three experienced players with quality to strengthen immediately our team. 

'Last season we went into the season with a different profile when we bought people like Mohamed Salah and Andre Schurrle - people that needed some time. 

'We also went to people like Kurt Zouma, but these players — Cesc, Costa and Luis — are ready.'
