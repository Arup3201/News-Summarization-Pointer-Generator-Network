A former White House and Pentagon official unhappy with the way the United States has been embracing equality and the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community has proposed sectioning off some states and creating a new country.

Douglas MacKinnon, who served as a writer for Presidents Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush, believes the more conservative southern states should secede from the nation to form a new republic that is 'dedicated to traditional values'.

The name for this country would be Reagan, MacKinnon proposed

'If you happen to make a donation in favor of traditional marriage, you can lose your job,' the right-wing columnist said in an interview with right-wing radio host Janet Mefferd, according to Salon.

'If you happen to refuse to bake a cake for a gay couple because it goes against your religious beliefs, you can be driven out of business.

Anti-gay: Conservative author Douglas MacKinnon is against the way the United States has been embracing equality and the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community and believes some states in the south could secede and form their own tradionalist republic 

'If you’re a football commentator and you happen to just say innocently that maybe I wouldn’t have drafted a gay football player because I wouldn’t want to deal with the distraction, many people on the left will try to drive you out of your job as well.'

MacKinnon, a controversial political columnist who has contributed to newspapers all over the country, is currently promoting his new book, The Secessionist States of America: The Blueprint for Creating a Traditional Values County ... Now.

He maintains his proposal for a new country is a hypothetical academic theory.

However he is serious about people thinking about whether it would work.

But where to start?

'We look at what states would be viable in terms of doing something like this,' he said.

'In fact, what states would provide sort of the new landmass for a new republic dedicated to traditional values.

Republican: MacKinnon was a former writer for President Ronald Reagan

'And the consensus was that the three best states in the union would be South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida.'

Mackinnon said Texas did not make the cut because its influx of Mexican immigrants makes it less traditionalist than the other states.

'The interim name for the country, by the way, is Reagan,' he added in the interview. 

According to The Huffington Post, Mackinson faced major backlash earlier this year a "pro-gay agenda" and was engaged in an effort to "indoctrinate" children.

The allegations were made in a piece for the Tampa Tribune.

MacKinnon claimed that the entertainment and theme park empire was 'introducing openly gay characters and couples in its children's programming' and '(incorporating) the colors of the gay pride flag in as many shots as possible'.
