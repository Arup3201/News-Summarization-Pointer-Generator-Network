Toys 'R Us is removing its Breaking Bad collectible dolls after more than 9,000 people signed a petition launched by a 'concerned parent' in Florida.

Susan Schrivjer, from Fort Myers, Florida launched an online campaign to have the action figures pulled from Toys 'R Us' racks, calling them a 'dangerous deviation' from the company's values.

Toys 'R Us, based in Wayne, New Jersey, said that the dolls based on the characters from the hit show are being removed immediately from its website and shelves.

'Let's just say, the action figures have taken an indefinite sabbatical,' Toys R Us said in a statement.

The retailer had maintained that the figures were sold in limited quantities in the adult-action-figure area of its stores. 

Ms Schrivjer said she was 'very shocked and appalled' when she found the action figures in a toy shop.

The popular show followed the transformation of mild-mannered high school  teacher Walter White into ruthless drug kingpin Heisenberg when a diagnosis of terminal cancer forces him to cook meth as a means to secure his family's future.

Both White and his business partner, Jesse Pinkman, played by Aaron Paul, have action figure versions completed with gas masks, a duffel bag of cash, and a toy bag of Heisenberg's trademark blue crystal meth.

'Anything to do with drugs is not doing the right thing,' Ms Schrivjer told Today. 'I just think that they need to look at their visions and values, as they call them.'

She has since put a petition up to remove the figures at Change.org, garnering more than 9,250 signatures as of Wednesday morning.

'Toys R Us is well known around the world for their vast selection of toys for children of all ages.

'However their decision to sell a Breaking Bad doll, complete with a detachable sack of cash and a bag of meth, alongside children’s toys is a dangerous deviation from their family friendly values,' the petition states.

'While the show may be compelling viewing for adults, its violent content and celebration of the drug trade make this collection unsuitable to be sold alongside Barbie dolls and Disney characters.'

Apples of discord: Susan Schrivjer has called on Toys 'R Us to pull these action figures of Cranston as Walter White and Aaron Paul and Jesse Pinkman pulled from the racks 

In an interview with the station WFTX, Schrivjer admitted that she was a fan of Breaking Bad and found the show 'riveting.'

But she expressed concerns that children playing with figurines of Heisenberg and Jesse Pinkman would come to mimic their criminal behavior.

'Do you want your child in an orange jumpsuit?' she wondered aloud, referring to the meth cooks' work attire on the show. 

Cranston, the star of the critically acclaimed AMC drama, responded Monday to Susan Schrivjer on Twitter.

'"Florida mom petitions against Toys 'R Us over Breaking Bad action figures." I'm so mad, I'm burning my Florida Mom action figure in protest,' Cranston, 58, fired off to his followers, sending ripples of glee through the Twitter-sphere.  

He's the one who tweets: Bryan Cranston took a funny swipe at a Florida mother who has complained about the presence of Breaking Bad action figures in toy stores  

Toys 'R Us says 'the product packaging clearly notes that the items are intended for ages 15 and up' and only available in the store's adult action figures area

The Florida mom said that while she loved the show, she does not want her kids running around dressed in orange jumpsuits like Walter and Jesse (pictured)
