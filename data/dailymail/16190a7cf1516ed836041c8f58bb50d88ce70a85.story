A jury on Friday convicted a 31-year-old man of killing and raping a University of New Hampshire college student following a trial filled with lurid details of sexual domination, experimentation and violence.

The jury in Strafford Superior Court found Seth Mazzaglia guilty of first-degree murder in the death of 19-year-old Elizabeth 'Lizzi' Marriott of Westborough, Massachusetts, in October 2012.

The key witness, 20-year-old Kathryn McDonough, was Mazzaglia's girlfriend when she lured Miss Marriott to their apartment.

She testified that Mazzaglia, a karate instructor, wanted another woman to join their sexual escapades, which included bondage and discipline.

McDonough first told investigators that Marriott died during rough sex between the two women that involved restraints.

After getting immunity from prosecution, McDonough changed her story and said Mazzaglia strangled Miss Marriott then raped her.

Elizabeth 'Lizzi' Marriott of Westborough, Massachusetts was choked to death by Seth Mazzaglia in 2012

Mazzaglia was found guilty of one count of first-degree murder that stated he strangled Marriott 'before, after or while' sexually assaulting her.

He also was convicted of conspiracy to falsify evidence and conspiracy to tamper with witnesses.

He will be sentenced to life in prison without the chance of parole.

Jurors began deliberating on Wednesday, after hearing 19 days of testimony. McDonough was on the stand for ten of those days.

The trial hinged McDonough's credibility. Mazzaglia did not testify.

McDonough initially told investigators that she killed Marriott during consensual sex but later said she made up that story because she loved Mazzaglia, thought they still had a future together and wanted to protect him.

Defense lawyers, though, painted her as an opportunistic liar who killed Marriott then changed her story when she found out she could cut a deal and get less time in prison if she pinned the crime on her ex-boyfriend.

The deal was conditioned on her testifying truthfully.

In court, she testified that Mazzaglia
 was the sexually dominant partner in their relationship and became 
angry when she left for nearly two weeks at theater camp without 
recruiting a sex partner for him.

As what she called punishment, Mazzaglia told her to lure a woman - Marriott - to the apartment on October  9, 2012.

After a game of strip poker which prosecutors say Miss Marriott willingly joined, Mazzaglia suggested she kiss McDonough.

Miss Marriott said no, saying she was 
in a committed relationship. Mazzaglia then asked if she would watch as 
he and McDonough had sex. She again said no.

The state's key witness, Kathryn McDonough, testifying on June 16  in Dover, New Hampshire. McDonough was on the witness stand for ten days as she testified against her former boyfriend Seth Mazzaglia

Prosecutors
 said the domineering Mazzaglia was unaccustomed to being rejected so, 
as the two women watched a movie, he sneaked up behind Marriott and 
choked her with a rope.

McDonough testified that she left the room briefly and when she returned, found Mazzaglia raping Marriott's limp body.

The two of them threw her in a river that feeds into the Atlantic Ocean. Miss Marriott's body has never been found.

Mazzaglia's
 lawyers said McDonough, who pleaded guilty to hindering prosecution and
 is spending 18 months to three years in prison, was interested in 
experimenting with women and initiated the sexual activity that night in
 the apartment she shared with Mazzaglia.

Miss Marriott had transferred to the University of New Hampshire only weeks earlier to major in marine biology.

She had been in a committed relationship with Brittany Atwood, who lived in Massachusetts.

On
 the night she died, Miss Marriot text messaged Miss Atwood minutes 
before 9pm to let her know she was going over to 'Kat's' to watch a 
movie.

Atwood testified she was happy for her because she was finally making new friends.

The text message was Miss Marriott's last communication.
