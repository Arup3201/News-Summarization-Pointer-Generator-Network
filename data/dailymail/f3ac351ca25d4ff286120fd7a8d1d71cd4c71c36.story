Found: Jemima Reade, 16, was being taken to school by her mother when she spotted her brothers in a field. She got out of the car and did not return

Three teenage siblings who went missing from their home were last night found safe and well.

The last sighting of the group together had been at a shopping centre on the same day the eldest, Jemima Reade, 16, disappeared.

Ben Reade, 15, and his brother James Reade, 14, left their home in Guestling, near Hastings, East Sussex, on Thursday evening last week.

The next morning their sister Jemima was being taken to school by her foster mother when they saw her two brothers in a field in the same area. Jemima then got out of the car but did not return.

The last sighting of them together was at around 4pm that day in the Priory Meadow Shopping Centre in the town centre of Hastings.

But Sergeant Jane Batcheler of Sussex Police said on Twitter just after 9pm yesterday: ‘The three missing teenagers have been found safe and well. Big thanks to everyone who called in with information.’

Before the teenagers were found in Hastings town centre yesterday, Sergeant Simon Barden had said the force was ‘becoming increasingly worried about their welfare’.

The sergeant added that they had been seen in Rye, Winchelsea and Hastings - which are within a 12-mile stretch along the East Sussex coast - and police believed they were still in the area.

He described Ben as 6ft, slim build, with short brown hair. He was last seen wearing a quilted black jacket, dark jeans and bright green trainers.

James was described as also about 6ft, 
slim, with short brown hair. When he disappeared he was wearing black 
and dark grey patterned fleece, jeans or jogging bottoms and grey 
trainers.

Jemima is 5ft 
7in, with shoulder length light brown hair. She was wearing a dark blue
 hooded top with white and orange writing on the front, jeans and blue 
plimsolls.

A Sussex Police spokesman said today: ‘Three siblings who had gone missing from their home in Hastings were found safe and well on Monday night.

'Ben and James Reade, who are 15 and 14, went missing on Thursday and their sister Jemima, 16, who went missing the following morning were located in Hastings. The public and media are thanked for their assistance.'
