The future of Radamel Falcao is set to be decided by Manchester United in April, with the striker reaffirming his desire to stay in England.

Last summer's loan signing from Monaco has found life tough in England -  scoring just three Premier League goals in 12 appearances - but he has bedded himself into Louis van Gaal's side in recent weeks.

That has served as encouragement for a club shelling out £265,000 a week on the Colombian and means they are now more receptive to a permanent deal than before.

It would still cost United around £43million to sign Falcao from the Ligue 1 side at the end of the season.

That's something which the 28-year-old is desperate to happen.

'I'm good,' Falcao told ManUtd.com. 'My family are comfortable. We're enjoying life in Manchester and here at the club. The people have been great with me, with my family. We're happy and very grateful.

'Right from the start, they [my colleagues] welcomed me. They supported me and helped me with whatever I needed. They are a really humble group of players, really decent and, well, I was taken aback by how kind they've been.'

Falcao hasn't been prolific but has scored two important goals in the recent draws against Aston Villa and Stoke City, with United supporters treated to an archetypal South American celebration.

'I place a lot of value in the hard work that I have to put in for each goal and I know just how much effort it requires, so that's why I celebrate like that,' he explained. 'For me, each goal means a lot so I put a lot of passion into my celebrations.'

And that could also be down to the difficulty in finding the net in the Premier League.

Falcao has never played in a league quite so quick, but relishes the challenge.

'It's more attractive than the French league,' he added. 'Defenders are stronger and more aggressive. In a good way, you know? It's intense and, well, overall just more physical.

'First of all, I'd say thank you so much for the way the fans have treated me. Then I'd want to wish them a happy 2015 and I hope that we can bring them some happiness.'
