John Guidetti has revealed he was so delighted at sealing a loan move to Celtic from Manchester City that he started dancing in a coffee shop.

The Hoops were given special dispensation to sign the 22-year-old on Thursday despite the late arrival of some of his paperwork.

Speaking exclusively to the official Celtic website, Guidetti said: 'It's really nice to be part of Celtic.

'I was standing in a coffee house when I got the news and I was actually dancing because I was so happy. I really was buzzing.

'Everybody knows what a great football club this is, especially in Sweden when Henrik Larsson was playing there. It's also a very well-known club because of the fans, who are so passionate and brilliant.

'Even the people at City told me about the European nights. They said it's the best atmosphere in the world. People just don't say that for no reason and it must be true because I've heard it from so many places.'

The Swedish striker has promised Celtic fans he will give nothing less than 100 per cent during his stay at Parkhead. 

Pecking order: The Swedish striker has struggled to cement a place at City following his arrival in 2008

'I know so much about Celtic. As soon as the club came for me I knew straight away, Celtic is the one and that's where I want to go.

'I spoke to the manager and I felt a good connection with him and that Celtic was a club that knew about me and were genuine about what they liked, which is so important.

'With a good manager and good fans and players, you can never go wrong.

'I'm just going to work my socks off to try to do my absolute very best every game and give 100% because that's what the fans deserve.

Who's the boss? Guidetti revealed that he formed an instant connection with manager Ronny Deila

'I'm very passionate and the one thing I hate more than anything is losing. I can't stand it.

'It doesn't matter whether it's ping pong or football. And in football for 90 minutes I am always giving everything and trying to do my absolute very best for the whole game.

'Sometimes you can have a better game, sometimes a bad game, but you can always expect 100% from your players and I'm going to give that.' 

Guidetti, who joined City from Swedish side IF Brommapojkarna in 2008, spent the second half of last season on loan at Stoke where he mustered six appearances without scoring.

He had a far more prolific spell with Feyenoord three years ago when he notched 20 goals in 23 appearances.   

Hard act to follow: Another Swedish striker Henrik Larsson was a legend at Celtic

And the Swedish forward knows he faces a challenge to follow in the famous footsteps of players including Henrik Larsson, Johan Mijalby and Mikael Lustig. 

He added: 'I know Johan Mjallby very well and Henrik Larsson's son well and I spoke to Henrik a couple of times. I know what the fans are expecting but Henrik was an amazing striker and they are very big shoes to fill but I promise will do my very best to do even a little bit of what he did.

'It's a lot to live up to and I'm going to do my best.

'They just told me what a great club it is and it's not for no reason that Henrik stayed for so many years. He was very much wanted in Europe, we all know that, because later he went to Barcelona and Manchester United, but he stayed because it was an amazing club to play for and that tells you all you need to know about Celtic.'
