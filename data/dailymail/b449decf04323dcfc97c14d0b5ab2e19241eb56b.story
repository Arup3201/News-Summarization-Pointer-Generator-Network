Dozens of dogs originally destined for dinner tables in South Korea are being imported to the U.S to be put up for adoption.

The first of 23 dogs who were rescued from a dog-breeding farm in the East Asian country have landed in Washington, where they will be given new homes as family pets. 

The rescue, believed to be the first of its kind, was carried out in a bid to combat the eating of dog meat in East Asia.

Dozens of dogs originally destined for dinner tables in South Korea, including these young pups, are being imported to the U.S to be put up for adoption as pets

The first of 23 dogs who were rescued from a dog-breeding farm in the East Asian country - including this mother and her puppies - have landed in Washington

The rescue, believed to be the first of its kind, is part of a campaign to combat the eating of dog meat in South Korea and other Asian countries. The farmer, Mr Moon Suk Jung (left) had wanted to leave the industry

The Humane Society International (HSI) - the international affiliate of The Humane Society of the United States - found the dogs at a farm in Ilsan, northwest of Seoul.  

The animal protection organisation said the dogs - who had spent their entire lives in cages - lived in 'miserable conditions' at the farm, where they were  bred specifically for human consumption.

The farmer, Moon Suk Jung, accepted compensation and agreed to give up the animals. He has now shut down the facility permanently and will grow blueberries instead.

The organisation said Mr Suk Jung hated running the organisation and had been seeking a more humane way of making a living.

HSI director of companion animals Kelly O'Meara said the dogs were now settling into kennels at the Animal Welfare League of Alexandria, Virginia after a long flight from Seoul.

The second batch are due to arrive on Tuesday next week.

According to Ms O'Meara, between 1.2 million and 2million dogs are consumed in South Korea every year. They are supplied by farms that number 'at least in the hundreds'.

HSI has been working with local groups in China, the Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam to raise public awareness of the dog meat trade.

It works with farmers who want to get out of the industry, by helping them to set up a more humane way of making a living.  

But O'Meara said South Korea was unique because it farms dogs to supply demand. Most other countries target feral dog as food.

She added that it was the first time that dogs from South Korea intended for human consumption had been rescued and brought into the U.S.

All 23 dogs will undergo veterinarian checks in Alexandria, before being distributed among five other shelters in the Mid-Atlantic states for adoption.

Megan Webb, executive director of the Animal Welfare League of Alexandria, which finds homes for about 1,000 dogs a year, said: 'By helping these 23 dogs, we'll be helping a lot of other dogs in South Korea by raising public awareness of the dog meat trade.'
