Aleem Iqbal, 19, from Solihull, West Midlands, has had a fleet of cars 
worth more than £500,000 torched in two arson attacks in just five days

A millionaire teenager has had four supercars worth more than £500,000 torched by arsonists in what he claims are a 'vile act of jealousy'.

Aleem Iqbal, 19, from Solihull, West Midlands, who goes by the name 'Lord Aleem' on the internet, had his flash Lamborghini set alight last Friday - just five days before three more of his super cars were destroyed by vandals.

The teenager, whose runs a luxury car hire business in Yardley with his father, said the culprits would be going down 'for a long time' - and he would 'sit back and enjoy the show' once they did.

But the wealthy car fanatic - who has a number plate on one of his cars reading 1 ORD for 'Lord' - admitted the loss was not of a scale that he would 'lose any sleep over it'.

He told MailOnline: 'I run a successful business and these people are just trying to ruin that.

'I have not done anything to deserve this. I work hard and I give back to the community. People say I show off but I don't.

'If I wanted to show off, I could say 'I am the ones with all the car, who are you, you peasants', but I don't say that.

'It is not a loss on a scale where I am losing my sleep over it. But it's just cowardly and I hope these people are found.'

Mr Iqbal's father Saleem originally set up Platinum Executive Travel, which offers Rolls-Royce, 
Lamborghini, Ferrari and Bentley models for hire, in Birmingham.

Now the teenager - who says his family runs by the motto that 'what's my father's is mine' - also helps runs the business.

He has more than 160,000 followers on the photo-sharing app Instagram, where he dazzles his fans with pictures of his latest cars, and proclaims that he is 'not your average 19-year-old lad'.

He also posts photos of himself with his luxury cars on Twitter, where his profile reads 'Let Your 
Lamborghini Make The Noise'.

But he says this prolific online presence - which he believes might have been a motive behind the attacks - is often taken in the wrong way.

He said: 'I post those things because I want people to be motivated by my success. If they are motivated to succeed and say I was their motivation, then I have won.

'Even things like the name 'Lord' - it was just a stage name. People might not like it but I can call myself what I want. I won't let people call me that in person.

'I have done nothing to upset people. The worst thing I have done is post some photos of some Lamborghinis but that's not me being flash - they are just flash cars.

The 19-year-old, who has more than 163,000 followers on the photo-sharing app
 Instagram, said he would 'sit back and enjoy the show' once the 
arsonists were caught 

'Lots of people buy themselves a Lord title 
for £20 these days and noone comments. I didn't buy one because why would I spend 
£20 buying a title when I have a number plate worth thousands with the 
name on it.'

The
 first arson attack took place after Mr Iqbal hired out a new £340,000 
Lamborghini Aventador Roadster for a wedding on Friday last week.

But hours later, the car was set alight outside a house in Luton, Bedfordshire, by three hooded men.

The group was captured on CCTV driving to the site in a Mercedes 4 X 4 before dousing the car in petrol.

Five
 days later, three more of his luxury cars, worth around £200,000, were 
destroyed in a second attack close to the family business, which was 
also captured on CCTV. 

Two Audi R8 Spyder supercars and a 
Bentley Flying Spur were parked in a hotel car park, near to where the 
company is building a new showroom, when the arson attack took place.

Speaking after the first attack, he said: 'I’m not really in a great state of mind at the moment - I’ve had half a million pounds worth of cars destroyed in the last few days.

'I’m not sure if its an attack on my family because they would have come directly after me or my family if that was the case.

'However,
 I do believe it could be a vile act of jealousy towards my business or
 it could just be mindless vandals on an arson spree.

'Either way, one thing is for sure they 
will be caught and when they do I suggest you sit back and enjoy the 
show because they will be going down for a long time.

Mr Iqbal, who says he is passionate about cars, had hired out the car for a wedding when it was attacked by arsonists

petrol and set alight by vandals

The £340,000 Lamborghini was damaged but Mr Iqbal says he hopes to get it back on the road in the next four weeks

He later told MailOnline: 'Some people will work hard their entire lives and will never be able to have a super car - they might not even be able to get a car - and that's not their fault.

'But it does not mean you can go around doing things like this. It is awful.'

Platinum Executive Travel's website offers chauffeur-driven car hire for weddings and corporate events and claims it was the first in the West Midlands to offer the Phantom for hire, with rates starting at £600 a day.

The company was initially set up by Mr Iqbal's father but he has now joined him in running the family business.

After the first attack in Luton, Mr Iqbal 
said: 'Fortunately the driver was in the house at the time but this 
could have endangered lives, there could have been dead bodies.

Five days later, three more supercars were targetted in an arson 
attack. The vehicles were taken away from the site of the Holiday Inn 
Express hotel car park, where they had been parked

West Midlands police said an investigation was under way following the incident, which took place near to the site of the car hire showroom in Yardley

'These arsonists really don’t know what they could have caused. When I was told about what happened I felt the ground beneath me move.

'It has taken a lot of hard work and effort to get where we are and we cannot take a loss of £340,000.

'I thought it would be toast but the passenger seat and dashboard is damaged so hopefully we should be able to get it back onto the road within four weeks.

The teenager said it had taken a lot of hard work and effort to build up the business and his family was being punished for their hard work

Mr Iqbal is prolific on social netowrking sites on the internet and dazzles his fans with pictures of flash cars

Saleem Iqbal, the teenager's father, set up Platinum Executive Travel, 
based in Yardley, which offers Rolls-Royce, Lamborghini, Ferrari and 
Bentley cars for hire

'At the time there were a number of valuable cars outside but it seems they went for the Lamborghini as it was most expensive.'

West Midlands Police said: 'An investigation is underway into a suspected arson attack at the Holiday Inn Express Car Park on Coventry Road.

'The three vehicles were well alight when officers arrived and are estimated to be worth more than £200,000.

'Officers have recovered CCTV that shows two offenders setting the vehicles alight at around 12.20am.

'We would urge anyone who saw anybody acting suspiciously late on Wednesday or in the early hours of Thursday morning to contact the investigation team in Stechford.'

West Midlands Police are asking for information on 101, or via Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
