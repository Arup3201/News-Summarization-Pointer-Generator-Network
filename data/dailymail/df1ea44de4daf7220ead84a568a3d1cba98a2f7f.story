A man of 80 was arrested yesterday by police investigating decades-old sex crimes.

The pensioner, who was held at an address in South London, is the 14th man arrested as part of Operation Yewtree.

The controversial investigation, which shows no sign of letting up, was sparked by the torrent of victims who came forward as Jimmy Savile was exposed as the most notorious paedophile in British history.

Police said the suspect, who was 
arrested on suspicion of sexual offences, is linked to the disgraced TV 
presenter and radio DJ.

The man, who was not identified, was later released on bail until an unknown date in October.

The arrest by Scotland Yard officers 
came as prosecutors began considering two files of evidence against DJ 
Dave Lee Travis and comedian Jim Davidson.

They are expected to decide within 
weeks whether the two household names should face charges for sexual 
offences.

Senior lawyers at the Crown Prosecution Service have also 
advised detectives on their investigations into TV performer and artist 
Rolf Harris, comedian Freddie Starr and singer Gary Glitter.

In a separate development, former 
Radio 1 DJ Chris Denning, the 13th man to be arrested, was re-bailed 
until October. Not all those arrested by Operation Yewtree officers are 
linked to Savile. All have denied wrongdoing.

The latest arrest came despite signals
from Scotland Yard over recent months that the Yewtree inquiry was 
entering its final stages.

Senior officers have spent millions of
pounds investigating a host of allegations that span at least five 
decades since opening the inquiry last October.

They were left red-faced when one 
officer who undertook searches  as part of the operation quit policing 
and walked into the Big Brother house as a contestant.

Thousands of pounds were spent on 
overtime as officers were forced to watch the programme around the clock
to ensure he did not jeopardise the inquiry.

Yesterday’s arrest prompted dozens of people to speculate on the identity of the suspect on Twitter and other chat websites.

This was despite the huge libel awards handed to Tory peer Lord McAlpine when he was wrongly linked to sex abuse claims.

Questioned: Rolf Harris was re-arrested and questioned 'over further allegations' last week after three women came forward in Australia

Last week, Harris was re-arrested on suspicion of new sexual offences when he answered bail.

The veteran performer was questioned over ‘further allegations’ following complaints by three women in Australia.

They arose after the explosion of 
publicity that followed revelations of his status as a suspect in the 
controversial inquiry four months ago.

Two men, BBC driver David Smith and PR guru Max Clifford, have been charged. They face trial in October and March respectively.
