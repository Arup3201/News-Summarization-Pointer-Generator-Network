Fears: Fiona Bruce, pictured this week, says that the BBC are worried about Ebola and she will not report from a high risk region

The BBC will ban guests from its buildings if they have Ebola symptoms as staff admitted they fear they will catch it.

Star broadcaster Fiona Bruce, 50, has revealed that staff including make-up artists are fearful because they have physical contact with guests from high risk countries.

The newsreader said their fears are 'not unreasonable' and admitted she would refuse to report from an Ebola-stricken region. 

Fears over the spread of the disease  means guests from virus-hit areas will be kept away from BBC buildings and interviewed on the phone or Skype.

Speaking at the Wellbeing For Women charity event in London this week she said: 'At the BBC we are having conversations.

'We have got make up artists who are saying, "Hang on these people are just turning up in our chair".

'They said, "They have just come in from Guinea? Do I want to be touching them?" Which is not unreasonable.'

'There will be companies up and down the land who must be having conversations about this if they have any international aspect to their business.'

The 50-year-old Antiques Roadshow presenter was asked if she would report from Liberia, Guinea or Sierra Leone.

She said: 'No, I would not. They could not compel me. They are not monsters. They can't. We will get some cases here. It is inevitable.'

The Government has warned that Britain should expect up to ten cases of Ebola by Christmas.

Screening of airline passengers from Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea has started at Heathrow and will be rolled out at Gatwick and Eurostar terminals.

More than 4,000 people from 8,900 cases have died so far and the World Health Organisation predicts there will be up to 10,000 per week by December.

As a result the BBC, which has a large presence in West Africa, will not allow anyone feeling unwell who has not been given the all-clear into its buildings.

A BBC spokesman said: 'There is no ban in place and people who do not have symptoms are allowed into BBC buildings.

'Where people have been exposed to the virus but have not registered with public health authorities we recommend interviews take place by telephone or video phone.

'We're working with Public Health England.'
