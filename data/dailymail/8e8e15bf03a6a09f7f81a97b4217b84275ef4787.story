A French housewife found guilty of sexually abusing two plumbers who had visited her house to mend a leak today has apologised to the men.

Identified only by her initials of I.D, the 50 year old said she was determined to turn over a new leaf and become a life coach.

On Wednesday a court in Arras, northern France, found her guilty of abusing the men when they visited her flat in October last year.

The 50-year-old French housewife made lewd suggestions to a pair of plumbers and rubbed up against their bottoms. When they resisted her advances she reacted furiously, smacking one of them across the face

Rather than allowing them to get on with their work, she forced herself against their bottoms when they were bending over, and made lewd suggestions.

‘When you have done with the radiators, come to my bed,’ was one of her suggestions, the court heard.

The men were not interested in sex, but that did not stop the women closing the shutters of her flat and making further propositions.

When shunned further, the woman smacked one of the men across the face, before throwing them both out of her home, Voix du Nord newspaper reported.

In their panic, the men left their tools behind, leaving the police to retrieve them the next day. 

The woman, who had a serious alcohol problem, also attacked police officers.

She was given a 12 month suspended prison sentence and told to seek treatment for her heavy drinking.

I.D. told the court: ‘I’ve now decided to take my life in hand. I’ve not drunk for more than eight months, and I’ve started training to be a life coach.’

She added that she apologised to the two plumbers, and agreed to pay them the equivalent of around £800 in damages.
