Freddie Starr has cancelled a performance to concentrate on defending allegations that he molested a schoolgirl in Jimmy Savile’s BBC dressing room, it emerged today.

The comedian, 69, claims he was 'made to feel like a criminal' when officers investigating former children’s TV presenter Jimmy Savile arrested him in Warwickshire.

He was taken into police custody overnight on suspicion of sexual offences. Starr has denied that he groped a girl of 14 in a dressing room with Savile in the 1970s.

'Made to feel like a criminal': Comedian Freddie Starr has cancelled his Back From The Jungle Tour show in Swindon so he can focus on defending sex abuse allegations against him

Fans were expecting to see the comedian perform his Back From The Jungle Tour at the Wyvern Theatre in Swindon, Wiltshire, tomorrow, despite his arrest on Thursday.

Only around 300 tickets - costing £19.50 - out of 635 had been sold for the event, which was due to start at 7.30pm.

But today Wyvern Theatre director Derek Aldridge said the show would not go on, following discussions with Starr and his team.

He said: 'Following the weekend, we have held further discussions with Freddie Starr and his management team and have agreed that the show will no longer take place at the Wyvern Theatre on Wednesday, November 7.

Denies allegations: The 69-year-old comedian has been bailed twice by police as part of Operation Yewtree, Scotland Yard's inquiry into alleged child sexual exploitation by Jimmy Savile and others

'Freddie apologises to the hundreds of loyal fans who had purchased tickets, but hopes they understand that he is concentrating on defending the allegations made against him.

'We will be contacting customers to refund their tickets.'

He denied the comedian was disappointed with ticket sales - or that the theatre had taken the decision unilaterally - and said the venue had not been contacted by fans angry about the allegations.

Starr launched his Back From The Jungle Tour this year after appearing on ITV's I'm A Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here last November.

He was forced to pull out after just two days due to ill health.

Hundreds
of fans were left furious last month when Starr didn't show up for his 
Blackburn show a day after he first publicly denied the sex abuse claims
against him on October 6.

Starr was taken into custody at a police station near his home in Warwickshire on Thursday as part of Operation Yewtree - Scotland Yard's inquiry into alleged child sexual exploitation by the late Jim'll Fix It presenter and others.

He voluntarily returned to speak to officers for further questioning on Friday following his release on bail in the early hours of the morning.

Starr was then released for the second time on Friday at around 5.20pm with officers saying he had been 're-bailed to a date in December'.

On Friday, officers raided his home, seizing his computer, hard drive, his old address books, old photographs and his iPhone, he says.

He denies claims by Karin Ward that he tried to grope her in 1974 when she was a 14-year-old schoolgirl.

Starr’s management team have not yet been available for comment.
