Once the initial infatuation has begun to wear off, and the tedium of daily life creeps in, the romance can begin to fade in many relationships.

A humorous new book pokes fun at the irritations of life in a couple using the format of the infamous ancient sexual positions guide, the Kama Sutra.

Part warning for those contemplating marriage, part comic relief for those who have already tied the knot, the Married Kama Sutra paints a hilarious portrait of the nuances of married life.

The Married Kama Sutra uses the format of the ancient sexual instruction manual the Karma Sutra

Each sketch is accompanied by a witty description

Once the tedium of daily life creeps in, the romance begins to fade in many relationships

Cleaning, work stresses, child rearing and even bodily functions are all issues that can creep in to sour married life, and are wittily depicted in the book,

As well as the funny sketches, which are in the same style as the ancient sex manual The Karma Sutra, the authors of the book, which is dubbed 'The World's Least Erotic Sex Manual,' caption each picture, naming the â€˜poseâ€™ with acerbic humour.

Written by Simon Rich and Farley Katz, The Married Kama Sutra will doubtless ring true for many in long-term relationships, and raise smiles at its astute observations on the realities of love.

The original Indian Hindu text gives practical advice on sexual intercourse, correct behaviours between men and women, and virtuous living.

Believed to have been composed between 400 BCE and 200 CE it describes and instructs on 64 different sexual positions.

Cleaning, work stresses and child rearing are all issues that can creep into sour married life

Many of the pictures will bring a smile to the face of anyone in a long term relationship

The hilarious facial expressions of the characters in the pictures make the observations all the more funny

The situations depicted will no doubt mirror ones experience by many in real life

The fast pace of modern life means many couples come to value sleep more than romance

The book, by Simon Rich and Farley Katz is available to buy from Amazon
