President Obama called for countries to break down the walls in their hearts as he gave a speech at Berlin's iconic Brandenburg Gate.

Speaking from behind a wall of bullet-proof glass, the US president removed his jacket and 
rolled up his sleeves as he battled the 86F temperature on Wednesday, 
quipping: 'People of Berlin, your welcome is so warm I'm going to take 
off my jacket.'

At times wiping away beads of sweat, the President read from paper because the teleprompter wasn't working.

He
used the bulk of his speech to call for a reduction in the 
world's nuclear stockpiles - as he stood  behind high walls of 
bullet-proof 
glass in the public square..

Rhetorics: President Obama's speech was nearly the 50 years after the historic speech by then U.S. President John F. Kennedy in Berlin in 1963, during which he proclaimed the famous sentence: 'Ich bin ein Berliner'

The two-inch thick sheets are routinely used
when the President appears before large crowds in public spaces.

Appealing
for a new citizen activism, Obama renewed his call for the world to 
confront climate change, a danger he called 'the global threat of our 
time'.

In a wide-ranging 
speech that enumerated a litany of challenges facing the world, Obama 
said he wanted to reignite the spirit that Berlin displayed when it 
fought to reunite itself during the Cold War.

'Today's
threats are not as stark as they were half a century ago, but the 
struggle for freedom and security and human dignity, that struggle goes 
on,' Obama said at the city's historic Brandenburg Gate under a bright, 
hot sun.

'"And I come here 
to this city of hope because the test of our time demands the same 
fighting spirit that defined Berlin a half-century ago.'

The German press had mixed reviews 
for Obama on Wednesday, a marked difference from five years ago when 
'Obama-mania' greeted him in the streets.

National newspaper Die Zeit published
an article online on the Berlin speech, saying that Obama appeared to 
be the 'young, fresh, uninhibited' political force he was five years ago
- but that the time between his speeches has been marked by 'bitter 
disappointment'.

The 
article said Obama's battles over gun control and equality for same-sex 
marriage must be remembered, otherwise his speech in Berlin could be 
seen as just 'nice words' in light of his decisions on Guantanamo and 
the NSA surveillance.

What a difference five years makes: 200,000 people came out to see then presidential candidate Barack Obama speak in 2008 at the Victory Column, around a mile from his speech today

The president called for a one-third 
reduction of U.S. and Russian nuclear stockpiles in his speech, saying 
it is possible to ensure American security and a strong deterrent while 
also limiting nuclear weapons.

Obama's address comes nearly 50 years after John F. Kennedy's famous Cold War speech in the once-divided city.

Obama
told Berlin that countries should not focus inwards and that 
in order to be stronger we need to break down the walls in our hearts.

He added: 'When Europe and America lead with our hopes instead of our fears we achieve things no other nations can do.'

Rousing words: Obama addresses the crowd in Berlin from behind safety glass

Obama's comments today in Berlin about 'breaking down the walls' come tinged with irony as the President delivered his remarks behind thick walls of bullet-proof glass.

The safety measure has been a constant presence throughout his presidency when he makes appearances in large public spaces.

The last time that Obama spoke to 200,000 people in Berlin, there was no safety glass  - but then, he was not yet president.

It was put up at his victory speech in November 2008, when Obama and family waved to supporters behind the two-inch thick walls. Since then, it has been in constant use.

The reported $100million cost of Obama's trip to Africa this month includes three trucks with sheets of bullet­proof glass - some of which will be used to cover hotel windows.

He challenged Americans and Europeans not to become complacent even though the Cold War is over.

Obama says there's a temptation to 
turn inward now that barbed wire and concrete walls no longer separate 
East and West in Berlin.

He said that he returned to Berlin because the tests of our time require the same fighting spirit. 

Obama added: 'Our work is not yet done.'

Other
than his landmark speech, the President spent Wednesday in talks with 
German chancellor Angela Merkel and other top politicians including 
president Joachim Gauck.

He touched down with his family in the German capital on Tuesday night, waving to the crowds gathered at Tegel Airport.

His
wife Michelle and daughters Malia and Sasha visited the city's 
Holocaust memorial on Wednesday, accompanied by the President's 
half-sister Auma, who studied in Germany.

Five years ago, when he was still 
seeking election as President, Obama received a rapturous reception on a
brief tour of Europe where he was greeted as a leader who could give 
the world a fresh start after the controversial presidency of George W. 
Bush.

Echoes of history: Obama reference JFK's famous words at the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin

Phew! Obama appeared to struggle in the heat today as the temperatures in Berlin soared to 86F

Political friends: U.S. Ambassador to Germany Philip Murphy and Auma Obama, half-sister of the President, wait for his speech in front of Brandenburg Gate.

Now he is a much more
divisive figure - although his re-election last year was welcomed by 
most Europeans, recent revelations about his administration's spying on 
internet communications have tarnished his record in the eyes of many.

Mr Obama's speech tomorrow will 
inevitably be compared with JFK's, which took place on June 26, 1963 at 
the Rathaus Schöneberg, a few miles away from the Berlin Wall which had 
been under construction over the previous two years.

Kennedy's
speech, considered one of his best, held up West Germany as a symbol of
freedom on the front line of the battle against communism.

It
featured the famous line: 'All free men, wherever they may live, are 
citizens of Berlin, and therefore, as a free man, I take pride in the 
words, "Ich bin ein Berliner!"'
