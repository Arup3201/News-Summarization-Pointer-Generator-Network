A design company has created a unique winter scarf which looks and feels as though it is made out of notebook paper - yet still manages to keep you warm.

The innovative Paper Scarf, which is the brainchild of Hong Kong-based company Little Factory, is actually crafted from Tvyek, a widely-used protective material often worn by industrial workers and used on medical packaging, which was chosen because of its similarity to notepaper.

And according to its creators, the $25 scarf cannot only be drawn on and personalized, but is also waterproof, 'breathable' and incredibly warm, despite its paper-like appearance.

The website whimsically states: 'If you are bored with the ordinary materials for a scarf, would you be adventurous enough to wear a sheet of paper around your neck?

'Yes, a sheet of paper which makes a stylish and nice-looking scarf!'

The Paper Scarf is over five-and-a-half feet long and said to be elastic and 'extremely durable.'

Bizarre: Worn long or short, it's guaranteed to attract double-takes 

Tyvek, an entirely man-made material, was invented in 1955 and is used today to make USPS mailing envelopes and festival wristbands for example, as is it almost impossible to tear but can easily be cut with scissors.

Little Factory isn't the first designer to use Tyvek for fashion purposes. Italian fashion label Fiorucci launched an entire collection of Tyvek suits in 1976, and more recently, American Apparel used it to craft a range of shorts.

Little Factory claims every item it makes - totes, blankets and unusual table mats among them - are based on 'interesting observations in our daily lives.'
