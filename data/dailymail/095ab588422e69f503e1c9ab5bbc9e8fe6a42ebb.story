Big Ben, the London Eye and Buckingham Palace may seem like major draws in the UK's capital - but not according to TripAdvisor.

The travel website has a little-known live escape game ranked as the number one attraction in London.

clueQuest has 583 'excellent' ratings, topping a   list of 1,096 attractions, including the Houses of Parliament, St James's Park and Royal Albert Hall. 

clueQuest is owned by four Hungarian brothers who used their different skills to develop the game

Number one attraction: clueQuest has received more than 600 rave reviews, giving it the top spot

2. Brick Lane Music Hall

3. HintHunt

4. Les Miserables

5. Bomber Command Memorial

6. War Horse

7. The Book of Mormon

8. Wallace Collection

9. Phantom of the Opera

10. Royal Opera House 

Created by four brothers, clueQuest is a real-life escape game where teams of players use common sense, logic and teamwork to escape from a locked room in 60 minutes.

The Houses of Parliament are 19th on the list, the Tower of London is rated 42nd, the London Eye comes in at 100th place and Buckingham Palace doesn't appear until 116th position

The number one spot isn't a fixed ranking with attractions going up and down the list throughout the year as more reviews and ratings are submitted to the site.

'We jumped on top in February but we dropped to second place for a couple of weeks around May, luckily we managed to regain our first place,' said Zoltan Papp, one of the creators of clueQuest.

Users who have been to the attraction have raved about it on TripAdvisor, with one London-based reviewer saying: 'I don't want to give anything away so I won't say anything about it. 

'Just trust me that this is a great fun and original activity to do with a group of friends! 5/5!' 

Another tourist from Canada said: 'Without a doubt this was the most exciting and entertaining thing we did during our time in London.'

The Houses of Parliament are rated as the 19th best tourist attraction in London

The Bomber Command memorial makes the top 10 tourist attractions on TripAdvisor, coming in at fifth place

The rest of the top 10 attractions on TripAdvisor include theatre shows such as Les Miserables, The Book Of Mormon and War Horse, the Bomber Command memorial, Brick Lane Music Hall and HintHunt - a similar live escape game.

James Kay, a spokesman for TripAdvisor, said: 'We're seeing escape game attractions growing in popularity across lots of cities in Europe, and nowhere is this more noticeable than in London, where clueQuest currently tops the city's TripAdvisor popularity index.'

How to play: Three to five players compete with the aim of solving mysteries in order to escape in 60 minutes

'The rave reviews from Londoners and tourists alike focus on the thrill of the challenge, and the rewards on offer for those that work as a team.'

He added: 'The rankings are based on an algorithm which measures factors such as the quality, quantity and recency of the reviews.

'We’re constantly incorporating new information, for example new reviews and ratings submitted to the site, to keep the rankings fresh and up to date, so they can change quite a bit.'
