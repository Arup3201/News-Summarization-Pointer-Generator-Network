Conventional wisdom has us believe that those at the lower end of the intelligence spectrum are more unguarded and trusting, but this is apparently not the case.

It is those with a higher IQ who are in fact likely to be more trusting of others according to new research.

And being more trusting of others not only benefits society in general, but tends to make the individual happier and healthier, researchers at the University of Oxford found.

Brainy people are more likely to trust other people, maybe because they are able to better discern who will betray them

Published in the journal, PLOS ONE, the study was based on an analysis of the General Social Survey, a nationally representative public opinion survey carried out in the United States every one to two years.

They found that higher IQ was linked with a greater sense of trust in others and society and suggest that intelligence may include a higher ability to judge character.

This would explain the findings as those with a higher IQ would be less likely to betray people who will betray them, and so develop a greater faith in others.

Many  studies have linked trust with all manner of positive traits for the individual including entrepreneurship, volunteering, self-rated health, and happiness

Lead author Noah Carl said: ‘Intelligence is shown to be linked with trusting others, even after taking into account factors like marital status, education and income. This finding supports what other researchers have argued, namely that being a good judge of character is a distinct part of human intelligence which evolved through natural selection.’

Many previous studies have linked what is termed generalised trust – a sense of confidence and belief in society and the world around you- with all manner of positive traits for the individual including entrepreneurship, volunteering, self-rated health, and happiness.

The researchers also found this link, but found that trust was beneficial for people regardless of their level of intelligence.

It seems that developing faith in people is likely to help you feel and do better in life, even if you’re no Einstein.
