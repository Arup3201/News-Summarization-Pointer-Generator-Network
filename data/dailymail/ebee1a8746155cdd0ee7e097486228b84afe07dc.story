A former mayor and her daughter who kept dozens of animals in their home which was knee-deep in faeces have been found guilty of animal welfare offences.

Pamela Ann Crisp-Beard, 63, and her daughter Maria, 24, kept a menagerie at their cramped terraced home which was so squalid that even the cutlery was plastered with animal excrement.

Rabbits at the home in Horncastle, Lincolnshire, were so desperate to escape their hutches that they had 'created a network of tunnels' through knee-deep compacted faeces which the pair had failed to clean up. 

The mother, who used to be mayor of the market town, and her daughter were found guilty of six animal welfare charges at Skegness Magistrates' Court today.

RSPCA inspectors found rabbits were so desperate to escape their hutches that they had 'created a network of tunnels' through knee deep compacted faeces

The family's pets included 15 rabbits, a golden pheasant, two guinea pigs, five mice, two rats, a cat, two dogs, four domestic ducks, a goose and 22 chickens, a parrot and two ferrets. 

Some of the animals were kept inside their home, including in a bedroom, while others were left in the back garden.

Neighbours contacted the RSCPA, with animal welfare officers finding their feet squelched on carpets in the Crisp-Beard's hallway because they were sodden with urine.

Pamela Ann was Mayor of Horncastle between May 1997 and May 1998 and a Horncastle town councillor between 2003 and 2011.

RSPCA inspector Deborah Scotcher told the court that, after a visit on January 13 this year, she gave the pair three days to improve the situation, which did not happen.

Ms Scotcher came back a third time with two police officers and a vet on January 29 and took the animals away.

She told the court: 'The entire place stank of urine and faeces and several rooms, including the kitchen, were cold, dank and dark, and full of rubbish and other debris.

'Some of the animals were kept in cages stacked from floor to ceiling in the front room and there was a gaping hole in the ceiling.

'Some of the dirty straw inside the cages was inches thick with excrement.

'I struggled to identify the golden pheasant, kept in the back garden of the property, because it was so badly caked in mud and faeces.

'On my first visit I found some of the animals were kept in cages with filthy, sodden straw. 

Pamela Ann Crisp-Beard (her home is pictured) was Mayor of Horncastle between May 1997 and May 1998 and a Horncastle town councillor between 2003 and 2011

Both the former mayor and her daughter were bailed and will be sentenced next month

'The cages were not suitable for the animals housed in them and some food bowls were empty, while others contained stagnant dirty water.

'Conditions outside were squalid, the garden was full of mud, faeces and urine, and my feet squelched in the mud and faeces.'

Fellow RSPCA inspector Rebecca Lowe said: 'The rabbits had created a network of tunnels through the faeces.' 

The court also heard that one of their cats was also so badly neglected it was 'stained' with urine. A rat was also crammed into a cage which was shorter than it's body length.

Both the ex-mayor and her daughter were bailed and will be sentenced next month.
