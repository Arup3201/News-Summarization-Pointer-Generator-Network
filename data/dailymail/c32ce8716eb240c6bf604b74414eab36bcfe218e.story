The wife of former New York Giants player Luke Petitgout has filed for divorce following a recent alleged assault at a swanky New York City lounge.

She's also allegedly trying to make her current temporary restraining order permanent.

A source told The Post that Jennifer, 'changed the locks on their marital home and has new codes on her alarm system.'

The source also told them that cops will be escorting Luke to the house on Friday so that he can gather his possessions.

The couple live in Woodcliff lake, NJ. and together they have three young daughters.

The most recent alleged assault took place on June 5 when Jennifer was partying with two friends at 48 Lounge in Manhattan.

Jennifer and her friends were speaking to two men, one of whom the women knew.

At around midnight, Luke allegedly stormed into the lounge in a fit of rage and reportedly attacked one of the men in the right eye, John Constantinides, 43, before slapping his wife.

He allegedly had to be restrained by the bouncers until the cops arrived to arrest him.

The New York Post Reports that Luke Petitgout was to be arraigned in Manhattan Criminal Court on misdemeanor assault charges for allegedly hitting Constanides.

Almost a year ago in August the ex-Giants tackle was charged with misdemeanor assault after he allegedly smashed Jennifer in the head and threw her out of the car on their wedding anniversary.

They had been celebrating out that night in the Meatpacking District of Manhattan.

Jennifer was treated at New York Downtown Hospital for bruises following the attack.

Cops say she told them she 'feared fro her life.'

Petigout was charged with misdemeanor assault but Jennifer dropped the charges against her 6-foot-6, 310 pound husband-not this time, however.

Jennifer's lawyers will try to have a judge order Luke to go through anger management and drug testing.

'This was the last straw,' a source told Page Six.

'He thinks this is all going to go away and they’ll reconcile. It’s not going to happen,' he added.Jennifer's adviser Nicole Noonan, the president of National Divorce Capitol, told reporters she is most concerned with her client's safety and the safety of her children.

'My paramount concern is the safety, health and well-being of my client and her children. Therefore, precautions have been taken,' said Noonan.

'I just want to move on with my life for my kids’ sake and my own happiness,'Jennifer said in a statement.
