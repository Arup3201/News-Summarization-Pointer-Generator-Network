It was only a matter of time before a family as big as the Bates was given their own reality series.

Bearing 19 children, making them one of the largest families in the U.S., the Bates, from Lake City, Tennessee, are the stars of a new TLC series titled United Bates Of America.

The giant clan are the best friends of the famous Duggar family who boast 19 children of their own.

The eight-part series began filming right after Kelly Bates, the family's 45-year-old mother, gave birth to baby number 19, Jeb Colton.

The Bates' children range in age from six months to 23, 18 of whom were seen in the TLC special Baby Makes 19 when it screened in March.

The network said in a press statement that each 30-minute episode of the new series will focus on 'a new adventure with the Bates family as they manage everyday life... and the inevitable chaos that ensues with 10 girls and 9 boys running around under one roof'.

It will premiere on the network on August 13.

In a teaser clip from the series, the family are seen welcoming Jeb into the family home.

One of the young girls tells the camera: 'When Jeb got home, it was just like a family reunion'.

Whole lot of love: The family consists of ten girls and nine boys including new addition, six-month old Jeb

One of the smallest, and most adorable, children exclaims: 'He's so tiny!'

The clip also shows how important Valentine's Day is to the family, who are seen treated to a special dinner with waiter service.

Jeb was in fact due on Valentine's Day however he was born premature.

The rest of the series will explore Kelly and her husband Gil's family values and love of music as well as their homeschooling and children's chicken coop-building and whitewater rafting activities.

Kelly had been taking hormones to help her hold Jeb in her belly after suffering three miscarriages in the past.

The
mother has had no twins, no C-sections and 14 drug-free births 
and has spent more of her adult life pregnant than not.

But, even with the unimaginable 
logistics of raising a family that could field two sports teams, the 
prospect of another baby was an answer to the family's prayers.

Kelly told ABC News' Nightline last August: 'It feels more normal to me to be pregnant than not be pregnant. I'm happy holding a baby.'
