A three-year-old boy has gone missing from a scout camp in remote woodland.

Caleb Linn has not been seen since Saturday morning when he was part of a group of 11 working on a clean-up project at a bridge.

Rescue crews began their search again today and were focusing along the riverbanks of the 900-acre, Kia Kima Boy Scout Camp in Fulton County, northeastern Arkansas.

Desperate search: Caleb Linn, four, has been missing since Saturday from a boy scout camp in Arkansas

Search teams have been using thermal 
detecting technology and a helicopter and divers joined the search for the
missing child today.Â 

Caleb, whose fourth birthday is 
next month, was among 11 children on the bridge at the camp, about 120 
miles northeast of Little Rock.

The children were not affiliated with the Boy Scouts but staying at the main campsite about half a mile from the bridge.

When five older children left to return to 
their cabins before noon, Caleb, from Springdale, asked leaders if he could try to catch up with 
them and he hasn't been seen since.

Wooded area: The four-year-old boy was last seen by family members who were helping at a clean-up project on a bridge near the Kia Kima Boy Scout Camp in Fulton County

Foul play was not suspected at this time, according to the examiner.com.

The Fulton County Sheriff's Office said state police, local law enforcement and volunteers were scouring the area near the Missouri border along the Spring River.

Sheriff Buck Foley said crews were clearing a log jam in the river today near where Caleb was last seen.

The sheriff said: 'He was on the concrete slab of the bridge at the last place they saw him.'

Growing concern: Caleb Linn, four, was in the company of an aunt and uncle when he ran after older boys in his group to catch up and disappeared

Authorities had set a net downstream in case the boy had fallen into the river.

However it was possible the body could have passed that point before the net was put up, said Major Todd Smith, the assistant chief of enforcement for the Arkansas Game and Fish Commission.

'It's like looking for a needle in the haystack,' Smith said. 'There's no way to search the whole river.'

Smith said the river is clear but moving swiftly with water temperatures in the lower 60s.

Caleb is three foot, six inches tall and
weighs about 41 pounds. He has short brown hair and was wearing an 
orange jumper, orange short-sleeve T-shirt, blue jeans and 
black trainers.
