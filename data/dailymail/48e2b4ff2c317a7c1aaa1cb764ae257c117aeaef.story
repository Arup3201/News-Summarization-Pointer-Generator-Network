A pregnant woman who was so overweight she was advised not to have a water birth in case she got stuck has shed 7st in just 12 months.

Rachel Reid, 25, from East Kilbride, Scotland, decided to begin her weight loss earlier this year following the birth of her second child.

The mother-of-two was tipping the scales at 17st and wearing a size 22 at the beginning of the year with her self-confidence at an all-time low.

Rachel Reid was told she was too large for a water birth and has since shed over 7st in just 12 months

But just 12 months later Rachel is now a svelte size eight and weighs a healthy 9st 12lb after chronicling her shrinking figure through a year's worth of motivational photos.

After safely having her baby daughter Hollie and overindulging at Christmas, Rachel joined Slimming World in January this year after reaching rock bottom.

She took a picture of herself each month to encourage her weight loss and keep her on track.

For the new mother the inspiration to finally drop the pounds came after her size prevented her from having the water birth she had planned with Hollie.

After safely giving birth to her daughter Hollie, Rachel joined a weight loss club and has slimmed  to a size 8

Always chubby, Rachel's binge eating habits worsened at university where she would live off takeaways

'Things came to an embarrassing head for me when I fell pregnant with my second child,' she said. 

'I had my heart set on a water birth but I was mortified when the nurse told me that my BMI was over 40 and meant I was too heavy for one.

'if something went wrong, they wouldn't be able to get me out of the birthing pool. 

'I was still wearing my maternity clothes long after I had given birth to my daughter. It was a way of trying to hide my size, plus the loose and stretchy fabrics were comfortable.

'I was always the biggest out of my friends and had low self-esteem. But during my pregnancies I used it as an excuse to eat more because I was meant to be big anyway.

'But the birthing pool incident was the final straw for me.'

As well as the difficulties caused by her size, Rachel says she was left feeling unattractive and unhappy.

Rachel says that by keeping track of her progress through photos she could see how effective her diet was. By June, left, Rachel was considerably slimmer and in July, left, she wore tight tops and slim-cut trousers

Rachel says that as she lost more weight she began to feel more confident in herself. Left, Rachel showed off her figure with a selfie in August and, right, she was even slimmer in a Lady Gaga T-shirt by September

In October the determined Rachel was awarded Miss Slinky by Slimming World for her dramatic weight loss

Although Rachel reached her goal weight in September she continued with her diet until this month. Left, Rachel wears a tight-fitting dress in November and, right, she shows off her size 8 body in December, 2014

'I was miserable with myself and I didn't feel beautiful or pretty at all.

'I was a chubby child and I would binge eat. I could regularly finish a whole pack of biscuits in one go and I would eat snacks in secret.'

Rachel says that her natural tendency to overeat worsened when she left home to become a student and was solely responsible for feeding herself.

'I gained weight over the years, and really piled on the pounds when I went to university because I was living off a diet of takeaways and alcohol.'

Rachel says that her weight gain ruined her self-esteem and she was always the biggest of all of her friends

The mother-of-two swapped her diet of sugary snacks for home cooked meals and fresh fruit and veg

Rachel switched her huge portions of takeaways and sugary snacks for hearty home cooked meals with lots of vegetables and she managed to lose half a stone in her first two weeks.

'I was amazing and so pleased. Losing the weight in the beginning kept me motivated and for me my goal was to be a size 12. That is what I considered beautiful and I was determined to get there,' she said.

Rachel steadily lost more and more weight and as well as her slimming success the stay-at-home mum also received plaudits for her incredible weight loss.

'I won awards with Slimming World each time I hit a weight loss milestone and when I look back over my pictures from the year I cannot believe the person from January is the same one as today.

Breakfast: Six slices of toast with butter and coffee with three sugars.

Lunch: Pack of biscuits and a shop bought sandwich.

Dinner: Big portion of spaghetti bolognaise, with fizzy drinks and Ben and Jerry's ice cream or pizza and oven chips.

Breakfast: Fruit including melon, strawberries and apple with coffee with skimmed milk and sweetener.

Lunch: Bacon, eggs, beans and wholemeal toast cooked using low-calorie spray.

Dinner: Slimming World recipes of chicken curry, spaghetti bolognaise and hearty stews.

'I reached my size 12 goal in September, but kept going with my weight loss.

'I am now in good habits and I have even started running. I am hoping to run my first marathon next year. I have so much energy now.'

Rachel, who is mother to four-year-old Dylan and Hollie, two, has been supported on the way by her husband Peter, a lecturer in accountancy.

'Peter has always told me I was beautiful but he could tell I wasn't happy with my weight.

'When he sees me now his jaw drops. He is delighted and makes me feel amazing. I am so much more confident now and my family have supported me the whole way.'
