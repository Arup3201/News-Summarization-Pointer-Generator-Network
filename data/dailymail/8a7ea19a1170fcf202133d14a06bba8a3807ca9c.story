Former Manchester United forward Bebe has defended Cristiano Ronaldo after his sending off against Cordoba in La Liga on Saturday, insisting it could have happened to anyone.

The Real Madrid star lost his cool as he endured a frustrating afternoon and was sent off for kicking Edimar Fraga with the game level at 1-1.

Ronaldo could have been given his marching orders sooner had the referee spotted his attempted punch on Jose Crespo as the Ballon d'Or winner's temper boiled over.

In one final act of petulance Ronaldo aimed a back-handed swipe at Crespo following the incident involving Fraga. 

But Bebe, who is on loan at Cordoba from Portuguese side Benfica, has given his compatriot a glowing character reference and explained anyone could crack under the pressure of such an intense moment.

'Cristiano has already apologised,' he told AS after the match.

'It is something that could have happened to anyone. It has happened to me and to many other players that I know.

'I know Cristiano from our time at Manchester United. He is a good friend and good person. 

'He is the best ever and what happened could have happened to anyone at such a tense moment in the game.'

Ronaldo could be set to escape with just a two-game suspension after it was decided that the kick that resulted in the forward being sent off did not constitute violent conduct, while the referee did not see the earlier punch.

Real went on to win the match 2-1 after Ronaldo's dismissal with Gareth Bale scoring a late penalty.
