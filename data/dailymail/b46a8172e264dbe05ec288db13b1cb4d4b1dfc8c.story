Watching on: Argentina manager Alejandro Sabella (left) oversees Lionel Messi in training on Friday

Key clash: Lionel Messi (Argentina) v Vincent Kompany (Belgium)

Messi’s form is everything to Argentina – he looked quiet in their last-16 game and then won the tie with a moment of brilliance late in extra time. Kompany is world class but prone to the very occasional slip – something he can’t afford against the four-time Ballon d’Or winner.

One to watch: Javier Mascherano (Argentina)

All the focus has been on Messi but Mascherano has been so important for them in midfield. He has played a lot of football at centre-back for Barcelona so his defensive skills are better than they were when he was at Liverpool. He sits deep in front of the back four and also adds bite. He has made more passes and tackles than any of his team-mates.

Head-to-head record: Played 4, Argentina Wins 3, Belgium Wins 1

Opta stats:

•    Argentina have won three of their four encounters with Belgium, scoring 10 goals and conceding four.•    In the World Cup, they have one win each: Belgium were victors in the group stages of the 1982 edition (1-0) while Argentina won 2-0 in the semi-finals four years later thanks to a Diego Maradona brace. That was their last encounter.•    Since the start of the 2010 World Cup, Argentina have won eight of their nine games in the competition, their only defeat coming in the quarter finals of the 2010 edition against Germany (0-4).•    Argentina have won six of their last 19 World Cup games against European sides at the World Cup.•    It’s the third time in a row that Argentina have reached the quarter finals of the World Cup. However, the Albiceleste have never gone further than the quarter finals since they reached the final in 1990.•    Argentina haven’t won any of their last four World Cup quarter finals outright, going through on penalties against Yugoslavia in 1990 and being eliminated in 1998 (1-2 v Netherlands), 2006 (on penalties v Germany) and 2010 (0-4 v Germany).

Lynchpin: Belgium captain Vincent Kompany will marshal the defence

•    Belgium have reached the quarter finals of the World Cup for only the second time in their history after 1986. They eventually finished fourth.•    Argentina have been victorious (via penalties or winning AET) in six of their seven World Cup games that have gone to extra-time.•    Argentina and Belgium are two of three teams to have won all their games at the 2014 World Cup (extra-time included), with Holland. All four of Argentina and Belgium’s wins have been by a one goal difference.•    Belgium’s six goals in this World Cup have all been scored from the 70th minute onwards. Also, four of their six goals have been scored by substitutes.•    Belgium have only been ahead for 52 minutes in their four World Cup games so far in 2014, less than any of the seven other teams in the quarter finals.•    Belgium and Argentina have had the 
most shots in this World Cup (83 and 80 respectively). Marc Wilmots’ men
 have also had the most attempts on target (32).•    Argentina have averaged 64.3 per cent of possession in this World Cup, the highest ratio of the tournament.•    Lionel Messi has scored (4) or assisted (1) five of Argentina’s seven goals at this World Cup. Three of his four goals have been scored from outside the box.•    Messi is the player who has completed the most dribbles at this World Cup (24) and created the most chances for his team-mates (18).•    In the last 16 game against Switzerland, Angel di Maria attempted 12 shots, the most ever in a World Cup match by an Argentinian player (1966-2014). He also scored the only goal of the game.•    Javier Mascherano has won more tackles than any other player at this World Cup (18 out of 22 attempted).•    Kevin De Bruyne delivered the final ball for a Belgian shot 10 times against the USA, more than any other player in a game at this World Cup. He was also involved in both Belgian goals, scoring the first and assisting the second.
