Taking his time: John Hurt as the weary doctor in The Day Of The Doctor, also starring Billie Piper

Hollywood star John Hurt has revealed that his role in the 50th anniversary episode of TV’s Doctor Who was one of the ‘toughest’ challenges of his career.

The actor, who will play an earlier reincarnation of the Time Lord in The Day Of The Doctor – to be screened on BBC1 this week – said he had ‘given his life’ over to the part so he could get to grips with the script’s ‘quasi-scientific nonsense’.

The 73-year-old star of the Alien, Elephant Man and the Harry Potter movies also dismissed a lot of modern television as ‘pap’ and said he was planning to cut back on his work commitments so he could spend more time indulging his passion for painting.

Hurt, who will star with Matt Smith and David Tennant in the episode, said: ‘It was one of the toughest parts I have had to  learn, as difficult as anything I have done.

‘There is a lot of quasi-scientific nonsense which doesn’t stay in your head that easily and that meant entire weekends spent on solid learning.

‘I remember Matt said I’d have to give my life over to it because there is a lot of learning and very little time to shoot.’

Hurt’s unexpected debut as the War Doctor in the dying seconds of the last series caused a sensation when it was broadcast in May. Last week the BBC released an online mini-episode, which revealed that his character had regenerated from the eighth  Doctor, played by Paul McGann.

Hurt last night remained tight- lipped about the episode but assured fans there was a lot  of interplay between the three Time Lords.

He said: ‘You have three people playing one person. It’s the holy trinity. The War Doctor is not as quicksilver as the Matt and Davids of this world because he comes from a very different place. He is a little stiller and more reflective – a little more world-weary.’

Hurt said he didn’t think twice about signing up to the show.

‘One of my agents didn’t reckon Doctor Who, but I said wait a minute, it sounds intriguing. It sounds like an event,’ he said.

Hurt is still asked to sign autographs for his role in the 1979  science fiction film Alien and he expects to come under intense scrutiny from some of the more devoted Doctor Who fans.

He said: ‘I’m very aware how important these things are to fans. For some people the show is their entire life.’

Hurt said he was less enamoured with other TV shows and his first love remained independent cinema. ‘I know television is where a lot of people are running to. But I think it’s not rehearsed well enough and its not as complete as film,’ he said.

Hurt added he had no plans to retire but would be cutting back on his workload.

‘I am not retiring but I’d like to slow down. I still want to do some painting,’ he said.
