Comedian turned political commentator Victoria Jackson has caused outrage by apparently comparing the tragedy at Sandy Hook Elementary School with abortion.

The former Saturday Night Live star, who is now an outspoken political conservative, posted a message on her Facebook account saying 'this is what you get' when you 'forget the ten commandments.'

Jackson, no stranger to controversy, wrote: 'My friend Jim Riley posted: "Wasn't the Connecticut killer just doing what abortionists do every day? It's a wonder we don't have more 20 year old "dads" doing what women and doctors have been an accomplice to for years in America. When you forget the TEN COMMANDMENTS, people, THIS is what you get."'

The Sandy Hook massacre left 26 dead - including 20 young children - after a gunman opened fire at the school in Newtown, Connecticut.

It is the worst school massacre in American history.

The post - which has so far received more than 150 'likes' - also quickly attracted angry comments, with one person suggesting that Jackson should have to 'go before all of
 the families that lost loved ones and explain to them why "this is what
 they get"', the Huffington Post reports.

Another added: 'You call yourself a christian? Your statements are about as far from Christ-like as I could possibly imagine.'

Not content with leaving it there, she added in a follow up post: 'Obama dramatically wiped a tear as he said, "The majority of those who died today were children -- beautiful little kids ... They had their entire lives ahead of them -- birthdays, graduations, weddings, kids of their own..."

'YEAH OBAMA. SAME AS THE MILLION BABIES YOU HAD ABORTED THIS YEAR.

'ARE YOU CRYING FOR THEM?!'

The former SNL star has courted controversy before. She made headlines throughout the presidential election, most notably for her response to Todd Akin's legitimate rape controversy.

She reportedly said: 'If I was raped, I would have the baby and think of it as God making a blessing out of something bad.'

And she also branded hit comedy Glee 'sickening' after it screened a gay kiss, unleashing her views in a homophobic rant for the conservative website WorldNetDaily.com.

She wrote: 'Did you see Glee this week? Sickening!'

The devout Christian added: 'And, besides shoving the gay thing down our throats, they made a mockery of Christians – again! I wonder what their agenda is?

'Hey, producers of Glee – what's your agenda? One-way tolerance?'

In the episode, two gay characters Kurt (Chris Colfer) and Blaine (Darren Criss) share a long-awaited kiss.
