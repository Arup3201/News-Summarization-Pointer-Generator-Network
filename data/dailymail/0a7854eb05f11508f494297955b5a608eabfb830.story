Much like Sam from the Dr. Seuss book, 'Green Eggs and Ham,' American kids were met with both delight and disgust when served typical breakfasts from around the world which to them seemed utterly foreign.

'It tastes like cow poop!' said one young boy when tasting coffee from Brazil as part of the gustatory experiment from website KitchenBowl.com 

Video of the American youngsters trying foods from Korea, Brazil, Finland, Vietnam, Poland and the Netherlands has nearly half a million views on YouTube since being posted yesterday. 

Korea: The American kids were less than thrilled when offered this Korean breakfast of anchovies, kimchee, and eggs though they dared to try it anyway 

Gross!: This American kid grimaced as he tried the breakfast typically served to kids in Korea 

The first breakfast the American children tried was from Korea and consisted of kimchee (pickled cabbage), anchovies, egg, and other spicy foods,

'There's a dead fish in it,' said one of the boys as he proceeded trying the dish with caution.

The others seemed to have a bit of trouble gulping down the savory tastes as well. 

When trying food from Brazil they were given coffee, ham, bread, and banana.

'I think it's weird that kids in Brazil drink coffee' said one of the American participants who was as shocked as 'cow poop' kid that the typically adult drink was an item on the menu. 

The children had no trouble munching on the banana part of the meal which may have been the most recognizable element on the breakfast table.

You want me to drink what?: This American likened coffee as part of this Brazilian breakfast to 'cow poop' but didn't mind the bread, ham, and banana it was also served with 

Next the adventurers were asked to try food from Finland which was characterized by a bowl of raspberries along with salmon and onion on a piece of bread.

'No I would not eat fish for breakfast,' said one girl who was presented with the common dish of Finland.

'This is pretty soft that could be my pillow,' said the spunky young boy of the bread, salmon, and onion creation.

One of the American kids was fond of the meal but wasn't quite sure where it came from.

'I actually would eat this for breakfast,' he said.

When asked where he thought the food might come from he replied, 'Africa.'

I'd eat it: This kid said he liked the salmon, onion, bread and raspberry breakfast from Finland but guessed that the meal actually came from Africa 

Another American girl who tried the fish breakfast had trouble placing a geographic origin.

'What's Finland,' she asked?

'A country in Europe,' replied one of the adults serving her the food.

The young Americans were then served a very old egg called a Century Egg in a breakfast menu from Vietnam.

'So it kind of has liked a portable toilet smell and a rotten egg smell,' said one boy when describing the Vietnamese food.

Vietnam: One American youngster said that the extremely old Centry Egg from Vietnam smelled like portable toilet and also rotten egg

Not pleased: This American child had trouble sniffing and stomaching this breakfast from Vietnam 

'This is really good,' said another.

The egg, sausage, potato, and apple, breakfast from Poland proved to be a hit with the American kids.

'This tastes like French fries and French fries are good,' said one kid.

The other kids stuffed their faces until they couldn't take eating any more food.

Poland: This American's eyes were bigger than his stomach when he was served the Polish breakfast of eggs, sausage, apple, and potato

The final breakfast from the Netherlands which was Hagelslag (chocolate sprinkles) on toast, proved to be the biggest hit.

'I don't think my friends would eat this for breakfast because their mom's would say it would be too unhealthy,' said one child.

'This is great,' said another girl as she voraciously scarfed down the toast leaving chocolate smudges all over her face.

While some of the foods may have differed from the egg and cereal breakfast common to American children, chocolate sprinkle toast may be popular with kids in America and many countries across the globe.

Disbelief: This American said he didn't think he or his friends would be allowed to eat the chocolate dish at home for fear that it would be 'too unhealthy'

Netherlands:: The kids unanimously enjoyed the Hagelsag (chocolate sprinkles) toast from the Netherlands and were sent into a chocolate stupor
