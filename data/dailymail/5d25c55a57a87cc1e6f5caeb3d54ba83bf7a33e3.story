Zoe Sugg, known under her vlogger name Zoella, sold a record number of copies of her debut book last week, but rumours are flying that she did not write the book herself.

The 24-year-old YouTube sensation's book Girl Online broke the all-time record for highest first-week sales for a debut author, selling 78,109 copies in its first seven days.

Rumours soon spread  that Zoella's book had been ghostwritten, and now publishers have admitted that the tween-idol 'did not write the book  on her own.'

Publishers Penguin has said Zoe 'Zoella' Sugg, 24, 'did not write the book Girl Online on her own,' but did not confirm that the sales success was ghostwritten

Girl Online, the first in a two-book deal Miss Sugg has signed with Penguin, is a novel about a teenage blogger, which thanks to Zoella's ginormous fanbase,is set to become the best-selling book this Christmas.

The record number sales is higher than the first books of veteran authors included JK Rowling and Dan Brown, author of the Da Vinci Code.

The figure is also more than five times higher than the number of copies which were sold of EL James’ Fifty Shades of Grey in its first week. 

'To be factually accurate, you would need to say Zoe Sugg did not write the book Girl Online on her own,' a penguin spokesperson told the Sunday Times, adding that despite this, the story is very much Miss Sugg's work. 

Girl Online's acknowledgements thanks 'everyone at Penguin for helping me put together my first novel, especially Amy Alward and Siobhan Curham, who were with me every step of the way.'

The former, Ms Alward, is Zoella's editor, the latter, Siobham Curham, is a freelance writer and the author of several young adult novels.

A since deleted post on Ms Curham's blog allegedly read that she had been approached with writing a novel in six weeks, and finished the task, 80,000 words, in August.

MailOnline has reached out to Ms Curham for comment.

Zoella’s ‘vlogs’, short for video blogs, attract 12 million hits each month. She began posting the videos in 2009 as a ‘creative outlet’. She now has six million followers on YouTube and is read by more than 2.5 million on Twitter.

Penguin Random House, the publisher behind Girl Online, agreed to sign Zoella after its CEO Tom Weldon was told by his 13-year-old goddaughter that the book would be ‘a huge best-seller’.

Miss Sugg was also an unlikely addition to Band Aid 30 where she joined Bob Geldof and One Direction for the charity single. She also featured in the November issue of Vogue.

Of the record-breaking achievement, Miss Sugg said: ‘It’s such an amazing feeling. I’m so grateful to everyone who has bought a copy of Girl Online. I love that so many of my viewers are enjoying the book! This year has been so exciting and this for sure is the icing on the cake.'
