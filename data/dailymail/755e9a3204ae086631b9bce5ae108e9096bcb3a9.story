Six Australian tourists have been injured after the railing they were leaning on at a temple in Cambodia suddenly collapsed, sending them tumbling down an embankment.

The Australians were part of a tour group who had been sightseeing on their final day of a seven-day Mekong River cruise when the the railing surrounding Han Chey pagoda outside Phnom Penh  gave way at 9.30am on Monday causing the six to fall about four metres below, reported The Cambodia Daily.

Four of the unlucky tourists - Sandra McIntosh, 63, Heather Todd, 73, Steven Burgess, 65, and Patricia Jachimowicz, 68, - were treated at the Kompong Cham Provincial Hospital for minor injuries. The remaining two injured Australians - Christine Menzel, 63, and Ian McIntosh, 66 - were rushed to Calmette Hospital in Phnom Penh.

Phnom Penh Post reporter Chhay Channyda told the ABC that the tourists were leaning on the railing as it crumbled.

'All six of them were leaning on the banister on the stairs up to the temple, which is obviously decayed because the rock is so old,' Ms Channyda said.

Ms Menzel suffered serious back injuries and a possible broken rib, while Mr McIntosh underwent surgery for a dislocated elbow. 

Ms McIntosh, from NSW, who received four stitches to her head, said the accident had not ruined what had been an enjoyable holiday with plans to travel on to Siem Reap for six days once her 'tough-as-nails' husband was released from hospital.

'[The railing] all of a sudden gave away and all these people just fell into the jungle,' she told The Cambodia Daily. 

'Everyone has been wonderful helping us—the staff at the original hospital, at this hospital [Calmette], and all the travel-company people who carried everyone out.' 

Meanwhile the Menzel's had no intention to include temples in their future holidays.

Ms Menzel's husband Phil, who was not injured in the accident, said the couple would return home to Adelaide in South Australia, as soon as possible for his wife to receive further treatment.

'We'll never go to another temple again,' he said.
