Tragic: Anne-Marie Ellement claimed she was branded a liar after saying she was raped by two colleagues

A probe has been launched into bullying claims made by a woman soldier who hanged herself after saying two colleagues raped her.

Tragic Anne-Marie Ellement was found dead at Bulford Barracks near Salisbury, Wiltshire, on October 9 last year, shortly after returning from sick leave.

New details have emerged about the way the 30-year-old corporal was allegedly bullied by other soldiers after making a rape complaint.

She said she was accused of setting up the Royal Military Police pair and was called a 'bitch'.

And the role social networking sites may have played in her death will also now be examined, the Ministry of Defence (MoD) today told MailOnline.

Newly released details of emails sent by Anne-Marie to friends lay bare her anguish after colleagues accused her of crying rape.

Anne-Marie, originally from Bournemouth, was the alleged victim of a drunken sex attack by 
two serving soldiers in her unit when they were posted together to Germany.

Because the 
military policewoman had been drinking and could not 
recall the events of the night - except, she said, knowing she had not consented
 to sex - the two men were never charged.

As a result, Anne-Marie claimed she was branded a liar and accused of making up the allegation.

In one email obtained by The Times, Anne-Marie told a friend: 'i was raped by two guys i work with, when i was drunk.

'They admitted to stuff i couldn't even remember, i came back out of my face with nothing on but my cardigan, no jeans nothing, as i had run away.'

But when she aired her belief about being raped, she said she was given the cold shoulder by workmates.

In another email she wrote: 'Cant wait to get out of here.

'But its true, you know who ur friends are, cos hardly anyone is talking to me.

'Like id make up something this bad destroying my career, and losing all my friends.'

The soldier found out soon afterwards that her rape complaint had been dismissed by the Special Investigations Branch, which is part of the Royal Military Police.

The Service Prosecuting Authority examined the evidence that had been gathered by the military police - known as the Red Caps - but no further action was taken.

Anne-Marie wrote: 'Ive had pretty much a total meltdown here, and the fact ive got f*** all friends here is hell. i feel like ive lost so much.'

A Red Cap who spoke to The Times said she overheard a man describing Anne-Marie as a 'bitch' who had ruined his friend's life by 'crying rape'.

Inconsolable: Anne-Marie 'never recovered' from her experience of allegedly being raped

Alexandra Barritt, Anne-Marie's mother, claimed the authorities brushed her daughter's claims under the carpet.

She told the newspaper: 'Anne-Marie told me how upset she was.

'She was a strong girl but they broke her in the end.'

Sharon Hendry, Anne-Marie's sister, said she was a 'shadow of her former self' when she found out the two soldiers accused of rape would not be charged.

'In my opinion Anne-Marie never recovered.

'No one believed her and her friends in the Army had turned on her, thinking she was making it up.'

In a statement released today, the MoD said the circumstances surrounding Anne-Marie's death have also investigated by Wiltshire Police and Her 
Majesty’s Coroner.

The MoD said before Anne-Marie killed herself, she 'received extensive
 support from the Army, which continued up until her death'.

They added: 'Our thoughts are 
with the family of Corporal Ellement at this difficult time.

'All allegations, no matter what their nature, are investigated.

'The Army has a zero tolerance policy to bullying and harassment of its personnel and takes these matters extremely seriously.'

An inquest in Salisbury heard Anne-Marie was struggling to cope with working an 80-hour week when she was found hanged.

She told friends and family that she was called in on duty on her weekends off and even when she was signed off on sick leave with stress.

And she said she was belittled and slated by colleagues for her work, with one even writing criticisms on the social networking site Facebook.

She also learned on Facebook that an ex-boyfriend had started seeing someone else.

The MoD told MailOnline that the role social networking sites may have played in her death would now be investigated.

'The circumstances surrounding Corporal 
Ellement’s death were [also] investigated by Wiltshire Police and Her Majesty’s
 Coroner and the inappropriate use of social media was not highlighted 
as a significant contributory factor.

'However, in light of the 
allegations that have emerged... the Royal Military Police 
are examining whether the actions of its personnel were appropriate and 
in accordance with wider Army values and standards.'

The attack left the young woman a shadow of her former self, her family said.

March 2012 An inquest records a verdict that Anne-Marie took her own life

'Anne-Marie knew right from wrong and would never try to destroy another person’s career,' said her sister Sharon Hardy.

'She
 tried so hard for years to accomplish her dream of joining the Army 
that there is no way she would jeopardise her career by lying about two 
soldiers in her unit.

'In 
my opinion Anne-Marie never recovered from being raped. I do not believe
 she was given any follow up support or counselling from her unit 
either.

'I think what 
caused her the most upset was the fact two men had taken advantage of 
her whilst she was intoxicated and no one believed her. Her friends in 
the Army had turned on her because they thought she was making it up.'

After discovering her body, police found scrawled in lipstick on her bedroom mirror the words 'I’m sorry'.

The inquest heard that 
Anne-Marie had always wanted to be in the Army and joined the Royal 
Military Police in 2006.

She served in both 
Northern Ireland and Germany before being posted to Bulford Camp after 
making an allegation of rape against two male colleagues.

While with 158 Provost Company she was described as a 'competent' investigator who was finding her role
 as shift commander a 'challenge'.

Before
 her death, Anne-Maire learned that her ex-boyfriend and 
fellow serviceman Robert Neal had started seeing someone else.

On
 the afternoon of her death she exchanged texts with him in which she 
expressed feeling angry, upset and let down by him.

Friends described 
seeing her sitting on the fire escape appearing teary eyed.

In the early evening she was found hanging. She was taken to hospital where she was declared dead shortly after arrival.

A post-mortem examination gave the case of death as hanging.

In
 recording his verdict, Ian Singleton, Assistant Deputy Coroner for 
Wiltshire and Swindon, said: 'Anne-Marie had a difficult time in the Army
 including an allegation that she was the victim of rape.

'She
 was signed off work with stress on September 19 and complained to her 
senior officer she felt that she could do nothing right and was not 
receiving the credit for the work and long hours she put in.'

He recorded a verdict that Anne-Marie took her own life.
