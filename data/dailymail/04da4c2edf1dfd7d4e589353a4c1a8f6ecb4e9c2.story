Wayne Rooney is still an excellent player who can make the difference for England but from what I’ve seen of him over the past 10 games or so, he has forgotten about the player he used to be.

Having been given the captaincy, I think he was trying to be disciplined and focused on Wednesday and he has got to release that a little and play with some of the energy and freedom of old.

He probably didn’t realise it but on Wednesday he got stuck in the inside-left position. When the wingers come in, he’s then got to float out and play wider. He never really read that situation.

And he’s getting pinned down a bit in one position. When he was younger, he was making movements off the ball much more. He’s becoming a player who wants the ball to his feet too much and to play passes.

I think he has a mind block. Someone has to show him video of the movement he made when he was younger and the space he created for others. It’s a pattern and it’s something he has to look at. It’s not because of fitness; he’s still fit enough to make those runs. He just has to mix his game up.

Coaches have to identify these things and make sure players see them. In the old days, you had to rely on the coach’s eye. These days it’s easier, because you have so much evidence in terms of stats and videos and analysis which can show exactly where you have received the ball and when.

During the World Cup, I raised the possibility of him dropping into midfield and long-term that’s a very real possibility for England and Manchester United.

Time for a change? Rooney could be deployed in midfield by England and Manchester United

United played with Juan Mata and Angel di Maria as offensive midfielders against Burnley and I can see Rooney in that role.

And if nobody grasps the midfield area for England, I can see him going deeper there, too.

Coming on to the play from deeper might suit him, as you have space to run into. Playing as a floating striker, you can end up with your back to goal an awful lot. For now, though, he will play as a centre forward and it’s important he gets back to his best.

He seems to be taking the captaincy very, very seriously. And there are responsibilities off the pitch, but we don’t want that to affect him on the pitch. We want him to have pride in the job but we don’t want him to think he has to change the way he plays.

He needs to be a mover of the ball, playing passes that will hurt teams. He needs to mix his game up.

We want the Wayne Rooney of old.
