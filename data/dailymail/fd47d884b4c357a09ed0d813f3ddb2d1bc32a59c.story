Armed with plastic bags packed with silver coins, Indonesian protesters today took to the Australian Embassy in Jakarta to 'pay back' the country's $1 billion aid donation given in the aftermath of the 2004 Boxing Day tsunami. 

The tongue-in-cheek protest followed an Indonesian uproar over Prime Minister Tony Abbott's remarks last month linking Australia's humanitarian work in Indonesia to the fate of Bali Nine ringleaders Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran, who are slated for execution by firing squad.

Carrying flags with Mr Abbott's face crossed out, the small group of protesters were photographed handing over the petty currency to embassy officials.

Is this a down payment? Indonesian protesters today handed bags of silver coins to Australian officials at the embassy in Jakarta after Mr Abbott last month referenced Australia's billion dollar aid donation to Indonesia following the Boxing Day tsunami in relation to the imminent execution of the Bali Nine

'Coin4Abbott': After collecting bags of coins, Indonesian activists today attempted to re-pay the Australian government for their $1 billion Boxing Day tsunami aid 

In late February, Mr Abbott caused a furore when told reporters: 'Let us not forget that a few years ago, when Indonesia was struck by the Indian Ocean tsunami, Australia sent a billion dollars worth of assistance.'

He added that Australians lost their lives in the humanitarian campaign and that Australia would be 'grievously let down'. 

'I would say to the Indonesian people and the Indonesian government - we in Australia are always there to help you and we hope that you might reciprocate in this way at this time.' 

Indonesian foreign ministry spokesman Arrmanatha Nasir responded by telling media: 'From what I know, nobody responds well to threats'.

Many Indonesians took social media to rail against the Prime Minister's remarks last month, particularly under the hashtag #Coin4Abbott

Many Indonesians took social media to rail against the Prime Minister's remarks, particularly under the hashtag #Coin4Abbott.

'Take Back All Money & S**t You Gave Us!' one Twitter user said, posting a picture of a jar of coins. Quipped another user: 'Go to hell with your aid Bogan Oz.'

Indonesia's Attorney-General has delayed Chan and Sukumaran's execution until all of their avenues of appeal have been exhausted. 

Mr Abbott told WSFM on Friday that the protest would not stop him from holidaying in Bali, adding that his diplomacy would take a more private form. 

'I would hate to think that our understandable dismay and disappointment and even anger at the prospect of these executions... would permanently blight the relationship, because it's too important to both our countries,' he said.
