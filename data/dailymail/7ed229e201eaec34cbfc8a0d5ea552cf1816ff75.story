As temperatures hovered at around 3C this morning, residents in a north London suburb were waking up to get ready for work. 

But already gathered in a quiet street in Stanmore, since before the sun had risen and temperatures began to increase, were queues of migrants looking for a day's work.

The large groups of men were seen standing in the road in long queues, hopeful to pick up work from passing builders and tradesmen in white vans who would pay them  for an extra pair of hands today.

So many have started to gather in the leafy London suburb that the queue had spilled out to in front of Selco warehouse in Honeypot Lane, which appeared to have security guards standing outside to ensure the large groups were kept under control.

Groups have been gathering at the spot from about 6.30am and there are reports of some approaching local workers directly to ask for work, and others stopping vans to ask if they are needed. They are frequently paid in cash - meaning they often don't pay tax or National Insurance.

Just 19, Iusti came to the UK four months ago from Botosani in northern Romania. His father died in August, his mother lives in Italy, his sister in Spain and he has a 16-year-old girlfriend, Valentina, back home. Her father works, earning about £160 a month.

He said he came here on his own to earn money. Soon after driving to London in a van with seven other people he found work near Victoria and Pimlico, labouring for three weeks.

Work has been sporadic and he now lives with 13 other people in a house on an estate in Queensbury, Harrow, doing occasional jobs in the area as a roofer.

Iusti says around 30 or 40 men, Romanians and Romanian gypsies, turn out at around 6am every morning looking for work. Some have been in the UK just a few months and speak little English, and most send money home.

In four months he thinks he has been able to find about six weeks' work.

But he has not had any for four days. Despite waiting since 7am today, his British boss had not turned up by lunchtime. 

'I get about £40, £60 a day, boss takes about £300, £400. Cash, no taxes. Three day work, three day no work. Two day work, five day no work.

Dozens of men, dressed for the cold weather, were seen gathering in Stanmore from early this morning

'In Romania is £100 to £150 a month, £10 for one day. Not work every day in Romania. No money in Romania. Problem. I will send money back to Romania. My girlfriend, Valentina, in Romania, I go to see her for Christmas.'

His mother will send him the money so he can drive home, as he cannot afford it.

Iusti says he is torn over his situation - between being trapped in his home country where there is no work, and being so far away from home and living alone.

'I like it in England, everything is working, I like. Zero money, no like,' he says. 'It is difficult. Here money, no family. In Romania family, no money. Life here is get food money, smoke money, sleep.'

Last week it emerged that up to 200 men from Romania and Bulgaria were gathering every day between a B&Q store on Honeypot Lane and a bar and restaurant named The Honeypot in a bid to find 'off the books' jobs.

The latest pictures show the queue spilling over to in front of the nearby Selco warehouse. 

The men start to arrive at about 6.30am and are hopeful of getting a day's work which will be off the books 

Migrants are being picked up by passing builders and tradesmen who need an extra pair of hands for the day

Men standing there are hopeful that passing builders will pick them up for a day's work.

They have been seen speaking to builders and other passing tradesmen who travel past in vans. 

However their presence has not been welcomed in the leafy London suburb, with residents saying they felt intimidated by the large number of people hanging around outside their homes. 

Groups begin to disperse about 2pm after most vans stop coming past. 

Suresh Varsani, who runs Dillons estate agents in Honeypot Lane, says Eastern European workers have been touting for work outside his shop six days a week for the last year. Around 50 or 60 people gather at Selco and B&Q every morning from 6am, sometimes staying until noon.

Up to 200 migrants were seen queuing up for work outside The Honeypot bar in north London last week 

He said: 'It even happens when I am driving. They just come up and say, 'job, job'. It has become a central place for everybody to come for work, and builders are taking them on. I think most of them are cash in hand and it is not right.

'It is an issue and needs to be dealt with. It is not the proper manner for looking for work. I get them hanging around my shop, which I don't really like. It stops other people coming in and it is not a good impression for people outside my shop.'

The appearance of large groups of men have led to criticism that Britain is becoming a 'honeypot nation', with endless low pay caused by the constant supply of cheap labour from eastern Europe. 

Migrant workers from Poland can double their basic pay by coming to the UK, and new arrivals from Bulgaria are able to increase their pay by up to 250 per cent, according to latest figures from the Open Europe think tank.
