A school bus driver in Kansas City, Missouri, punished a blind 8-year-old boy for misbehaving by taking away his walking stick and replacing it with a soft pool noodle earlier this week.

Rachel and Dakota Nafzinger say their son, Dakota, was left humiliated when the school staffer handed him the floppy, lime-green toy on his way from Gracemor Elementary School Monday.

Dakota suffers from a rare medical condition called bilateral anopthalmia and was born without eyes.

Bus incident: The student was on his way home from Gracemor Elementary School in Kansas City Monday when he allegedly used his cane to hit someone   

Despite his affliction, the 8-year-old enjoys singing, swimming and fishing, but he relies on a cane to get around. 

‘Why would you do that? Why would you take the one thing that he’s supposed to use all the time? That’s his eyes,' his mother told Fox4KC.

North Kansas City School District Spokeswoman Michelle Cronk said Dakota's walking stick was school property that was given to him when he entered the school, and that it was taken away from him Monday after he struck someone with it while riding the bus.

The school district representative said that the driver handed Dakota the pool toy as a substitute because the boy tends to fidget unless he has something in his hands.

The 8-year-old said he was told by school officials that he will have to rely on the Styrofoam tube for the next two weeks, but according to the child, it is of no use to him and makes it much harder for him to feel his way when walking.

Misunderstanding: Dakota's father, Donald (left), said his son has a tendency to lift his walking stick (right) - a gesture which may have been misinterpreted as an act of aggression 

Rachel Nafzinger, pictured, said she does not understand why anyone would take away the one thing her son needs to function 

Rachel Nafzinger, the boy's mother, said she does not understand why school officials chose to punish her special-needs son by depriving him of the one thing he needs most in his day-to-day life.

‘He’s gone through so much in his life already… and I just don’t like someone else putting my son in that position,’ she said.

Donald Nafzinger has suggested that perhaps Dakota lifted his cane in the air, as he often does, and the driver mistook it for an act of aggression.

On Wednesday, the North Kansas City School District released a statement saying that an internal investigation has determined that a ‘mistake’ was made Monday.

The district has since apologized to the Nafzinger family.
