Sprinting across the finish line alongside her mother, Paula Radcliffe’s daughter is clearly following in her footsteps.

Isla, seven, was awarded a medal for competing in the Young Athletes Run in Worcester yesterday.

She then gave her mother her own prize for coming third in the adults’ 10k race.

The pair embraced and posed for photos in scenes reminiscent of 2008, when Radcliffe won the women’s New York City Marathon.

Isla was just under two at the time, but has since grown into a keen runner – and put in an admirable performance in the mile-long run.

The event also marked 40-year-old Radcliffe’s return to athletics after a break of more than two years.

The women’s marathon record holder clocked a time of 35 minutes and 49 seconds in yesterday’s race, after being forced to miss the London 2012 Olympics because of a foot injury.

She now plans to run in next year’s London Marathon as a grand finale to her career.

Ongoing complications with her injury had led to fears that the mother-of-two might never compete again.

But earlier this year she said she dreamed of running just one more London Marathon.

It was at the event in 2003 that the European and Commonwealth Games gold medallist set her record-breaking time of two hours, 15 minutes and 25 seconds.

She has not competed since the Vienna half-marathon in April 2012, when she clocked a time of one hour, 12 minutes and three seconds.
