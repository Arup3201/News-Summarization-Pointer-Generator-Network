The Price is NOT Right: Brandi Cochran could lose the $7.7million that she won last year after claiming she was discriminated over her pregnancy

A former model for The Price Is Right could lose the $7.7million that she won last year after claiming she was discriminated over her 2008 pregnancy, and wrongfully terminated.

Brandi Cochran, 42, who appeared on the show for seven years, was awarded the multi-million-dollar sum in punitive 
damages last November following a high-profile legal battle with The Price Is Right Productions and  producers FremantleMedia North America.

But now the case is going back to trial after a Los Angeles Superior Court judge decreed yesterday that there were 'bad jury instructions'.

According to The Hollywood Reporter, the judge in last year's trial failed to tell the jury that the discrimination in question had to be a "substantial" motivation factor, despite a request to do so from the defendants.

The news comes just a week after the California Supreme Court issued a new ruling that discrimination must be a substantial motivating factor in mixed motive cases.

Judge Kevin Brazile wrote in yesterday's ruling: 'The instruction error cannot be considered harmless. Of central importance to the case was the weight 
given to discriminatory intent and whether that intent need only be of a
 mere motivating factor or a substantial factor.

'Given this central 
dispute, the failure to give the proper instruction regarding 
substantial factor cannot be considered harmless, and a new trial must 
be granted.'

Ms Cochran appeared on The Price Is Right for seven years using her maiden name, Brandi Sherwood, alongside former host Bob Barker and current host Drew Carey.

In the trial last year, Ms Cochran claimed she got pregnant in 
2007 but couldn’t tell anyone at work as she was so scared of losing her
 job and, due to the severe stress, ‘that pregnancy ended in a 
miscarriage’.

According to Us Magazine, one producer even told Ms Cochran that losing this pregnancy was ‘nature's way of getting rid of a bad baby.’

When
she got pregnant again, with twins, in late 2008, it is claimed that producers 
subjected her to cruel insults. When she walked past the one 
producer he allegedly scoffed: 'Wide load coming through.'

Ms Cochran claims that she was rejected by producers when she sought to return to the show in early 2010.

'They ignored me, for probably about four months, trying to get a direct response about working,' she told KABC.

Since the verdict was announced last November, FremantleMedia has launched an appeal.

It said in a statement to KABC: 'We
 believe the verdict in this case was the result of a flawed process in 
which the court, among other things, refused to allow the jury to hear 
and consider that 40per cent of our models have been pregnant and other 
important evidence to our defense.

'We expect to be fully vindicated after the matter has been reviewed.'

Last month, a Price is Right model appeared 
on air with a huge baby bump in a 
pre-recorded celebrity special featuring Real Housewife Nene Leakes.

Rachel Reynolds, 30, who is married to Cleveland Indians player David Dellucci, was seen assisting on a game with a heavily-pregnant 
stomach.

She was 
likely very close to her due date, because she welcomed a baby girl 
named Ruby on February 13.

Perhaps anticipating a verdict in last
 year's legal proceedings, The Price Is Right also made a show of 
announcing Ms Reynolds' pregnancy last September.

In the first episode of season 41, she presents a prize of an iPad bearing images of her sonogram on the screen.

Host
 Drew Carey is the first to congratulate her as co-workers, another of 
whom is visibly pregnant, gather round to offer their warm wishes.
