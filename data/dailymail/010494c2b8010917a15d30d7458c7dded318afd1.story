Carol Vorderman has always dreamed of learning to fly.

So perhaps it is only natural she should fall for a dashing stunt pilot.

The former Countdown presenter, 51, has started dating a former Red Arrows Squadron Leader 14 years her junior.

It is thought she met 37-year-old  Graham Duff – a separated father of one – at a Red Arrows charity ball.

Miss Vorderman has for a long time been a supporter of the elite squadron, officially known as the Royal Air Force Aerobatic Team.

It is not known whether Mr Duff has given her flying lessons.

A friend of the TV presenter said: ‘Carol and Graham started dating very recently. Everyone knows him as Duffy, he’s a nice guy and going through a divorce. He separated and moved to London a while ago.

‘Obviously they are in the v

ery early stages of a relationship, and it may or may not work out for them, but they seem fond of each other.’

Miss Vorderman invited Mr Duff to 
join her on the set of Food, Glorious Food, a cooking talent show which 
she presents, on Saturday.

Mr Duff looked on proudly as she filmed the fifth audition round of the show in the grounds of Knebworth House, Hertfordshire, and seemed delighted to be introduced to some of her friends between takes.

Miss Vorderman, a mother of two, recently revealed she hopes to pass her private pilot’s licence this year.

She said: ‘Once I’ve got the licence, I plan to start training in aerobatics. It’s the showing off bit of flying. It takes years to master, but I’m keen to learn.’

Mr Duff joined the Red Arrows in 2008 and until recently lived in Scothern, near the squadron’s Lincolnshire base.

The former RAF pilot has flown fighter jets in Iraq and last year climbed Mount Everest, raising almost £20,000 for charity.

He left the Red Arrows in 2010 and has set up a business developing mobile phone apps.

His business partner Christopher Foulston, 28, said Miss Vorderman has invested in the company but he did not realise they were going out. Her spokesman confirmed they were dating, saying: ‘Carol is very private about her relationships.

‘However, in this case, to set the record straight, very recently Carol and Graham have just started to date, they get on well and would at this moment like to carry on seeing each other.’

Mr Duff is in the process of divorcing his wife Katie, 37, with whom  he has a son aged one. A neighbour said he moved out of the family home several months ago but occasionally visits at weekends.

Mrs Duff, a nurse, said she did not know anything about her husband’s relationship with Miss Vorderman. 

A self-confessed ‘daredevil’, Miss Vorderman studied engineering at Cambridge and dreamed of becoming an airline pilot until she was told women could not apply.

The presenter has helped the RAF with fundraising events for the past seven years and described the Red Arrows as ‘dear friends’.

Last month, she hosted a ball in memory of Arrows pilot Jon Egging, who died in a crash at the 2011 Bournemouth Air Festival.

Twice divorced, she has two children – Katie, 20, and Cameron, 15.
