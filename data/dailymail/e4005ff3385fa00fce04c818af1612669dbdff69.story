Tavarius McNair is just 14 years old. A softly-spoken boy with thick-rimmed black glasses and a mournful air, he seems gentle and is clearly devoted to his mother.

And yet, McNair is one of 150 boys living in C-Complex, a wing of Pendleton Juvenile Correctional Facility in Indiana that specialises in the treatment of young sex offenders.

Like an estimated 70,000 juvenile offenders across the US, McNair, and his room mate Garrett Clutter, 15, is a 'chomo' - a child molester.

'I did a sexual offence on a family member,' explains McNair. 'My friends tell me they will kill me if they see me again. I feel like people see a label on me now because of that one thing. I feel lost.'

The child of a single mother and an absent father, McNair's childhood was blighted by his mother's drug addiction which she funded by turning to prostitution.

And his story is by no means unique. 'The majority of the boys have come from very difficult backgrounds,' explains Matt Pelly, who spent a month inside the prison filming new documentary, Kid Criminals.

'Most of them aren't bad eggs. They do it out of bad decision making.'

Both McNair and Clutter are taking part in a programme aimed at rehabilitating the boys and turning their lives around.

If they pass the nine-month course, they will be released and have their record wiped clean. If not, they will stay in the facility indefinitely.

The programme, which is overseen by an army of counsellors, has produced a re-offending rate of around seven per cent - half the amount of recidivism found among adult sex offenders.

'They're in here for sexual misconduct with animals, young children,' explains one Pendleton counsellor in an attempt to explain how the children end up on the programme.

'They're having sex with animals, their younger sisters, each other... Some of them are watching porn at a very young age. That has to have something to do with it.'

Sadly, the treatment doesn't always work as the case of William McConnell, Pendleton's most notorious sex offender, reveals.

McConnell, now 18, has been in sex offender treatment programmes on three separate occasions and was first sent to the facility aged 15.

Each time he has been released, he has re-offended and has to be kept in segregation and monitored 24 hours a day, thanks to his predilection for grooming the younger boys. 

He complains to staff and constantly asks to be moved to a room where he can watch the other boys in the shower.

Nevertheless, he insists that should he leave, other children will be safe from him. 'I have been in here three times because they don't think I can control my sexual issues,' he explains.

'But I can. One of the worst things I did was sexually abuse a kid to get revenge on my mentor because I wanted him fired.' 

McConnell says his own history of abuse, which began when he was first placed in care aged six, has left him a troubled individual.

'I've been abused by my biological family and in care,' he reveals. 'I've had a pretty rough life. Everyone says I'm really messed up in the head.'

McConnell, who expects to be released before he is 22, will leave Pendleton knowing that if he re-offends again, his next stop will be adult jail.

For the others, among them 15-year-old Clutter, release means the chance to attempt to build a 'normal' life.

'My family has forgiven me,' he says. 'Do I deserve it? Probably not. I just want to live a normal life. I want to be a marine biologist.'

Clutter, who says he first saw pornography online aged eight, is the child of a loving mother and an abusive father, a man who disappeared three years ago when allegations of abuse were laid at his door.

Troubled: Garrett Clutter was himself a victim of violent abuse at the hands of his father

His father, who he first met aged five, would physically abuse him during visits to his house and once threw him into a washing machine and switched it on. 

'For me, being abused made it feel like something was missing in me,' he says. 'I call it the hole. My dad would use corporal punishment, he'd make me stand in the corner all night. 

'It's crazy not being able to live with myself because all the time I was a little kid, I'd be thinking, did I do something to deserve this? Am I really this bad that he has to do this stuff to me?'

But, as with McNair, Clutter's troubled childhood resulted in sexual abuse of others, in his case, attacking a younger female family member over a period of four years.

Children like Clutter and McNair are helped by counsellors, among them Tammi Prince who is in charge of dealing with the younger boys.

'The counsellors were saints,' says Pelly. 'Miss Prince helps these kids through really dark times.  Counsellors are like surrogate parents for these kids.'

For her part, Prince, who has heard some of the most harrowing stories imaginable, says she has been desensitised to much of what she hears - and says that is a good thing.

'At first I got chills but with time, I've become desensitised,' she explains.'I think that helps them [the children] because I'm not looking at them with shock all the time.'

But not all of the young inmates are easy to deal with. 'The inward kids are the ones you have to pay the most attention to,' she says. 'They're the ones you have to watch. They're the masterminds.'

One child who doesn't appear to be any sort of mastermind is McNair, who Prince describes as 'one of my most interesting boys. He's troubled.'

All McNair really wants is to see his mother. 'It's been five months since I saw my mom,' he says. 'I'm alone up here, so I want to see her more.

'Sometimes I blame her for not being a better parent. But she's never given up on me. Without her, I'd be much worse.'

McNair, who says his crime was motivated by wanting 'someone to care for me', also has big plans for the future. 

'I've always wanted to be a scientist,' he says, smiling shyly. 'I want to do something with science. Maybe that is my calling.'
