David Cameron has come under pressure to follow Spain's example tighten border controls

Ministers were last night under pressure to tighten border controls for EU citizens after Spain demanded ‘proof of income’ from expats  hoping to live in the country.

The move – taken in response to the country’s economic crisis – was said by one Tory MP to have ‘driven a coach and horses’ through the EU’s cherished principle of the free movement of peoples, and immediately triggered calls for David Cameron to adopt tougher measures.

Madrid hopes to save more than €1 billion euros (£780 million) a year by clamping down on ‘economic migrants’ from other EU countries, including the UK.

A new ministerial order, slipped out by the Spanish government on July 9, states that any EU citizen living in Spain for more than three months must prove they will not become a financial burden on the State by producing a job contract or documents confirming they have enough money to support themselves.

If they are jobless, they must also show they are covered by health insurance. The decree, which potentially affects thousands of Britons seeking a new life in the country, declares that Spain will now adopt  a stricter interpretation of the ‘free movement’ principle.

The Spanish government has justified the measures by pointing to Article 7 of the 2004 EU directive on free movement, which gives EU member states the power to define it ‘without prejudice to national border controls’ – in other words, entry conditions can be imposed on other EU citizens by member governments.

The UK has also enacted the provision – and the Home Office insists that it does demand that EU citizens should not be ‘an unreasonable  burden on public funds’ before allowing them to stay in the UK.

However, Phil Woolas, who served as Immigration Minister between 2008 and 2010, told The Mail on  Sunday last night that the powers were almost never used.

He said: ‘We do have the powers  to deport EU citizens – but they are ignored by the British authorities. We should heed the Spanish example and change our approach.

It is only fair that we enforce the laws available to us and stop turning a blind eye to abuses by EU citizens.’

Mr Woolas revealed that when he was a Minister he tried to deport a group of Polish rough-sleepers who had set up camp  in Peterborough town centre – but was repeatedly told by officials that he had no powers to do so.

‘The idea that we check bank statements to ensure these people are not a burden is just nonsense,’ he said. ‘Freedom of movement is still the prevailing doctrine.’

The Spanish government admits in a 
preamble to the legislation that it has failed in the past to regulate 
immigration from within the EU.

This,
 it says, ‘has implied  a serious economic loss to Spain, especially 
because of the impossibility of guaranteeing the refund of expenditure 
caused by the provision of health  and social services to European 
citizens’.

Tough times: Spanish demonstrators take to the streets to protest against the country's austerity measures

Since 2007, EU citizens living in Spain for more than three months have had to register with the authorities, but there have been no checks on their financial situation.

British diplomats in Madrid are trying to establish how the rule change will affect the 400,000 Britons who have homes in Spain.

One Foreign Office source said: ‘We 
don’t yet know how much money a British citizen would be expected to 
have in their bank in order to qualify. It is all a bit unclear. 
Frankly, we think the Spanish could have handled this a little better.’

Last
 night Tory MP Douglas Carswell said he had written to Immigration 
Minister Damian Green to ask if the UK Government had the power to 
impose similar measures. ‘Spain’s decision to insist on medical 
insurance is a key idea – and if  introduced by us could reduce the 
burden on our services,’ he said.

‘The fact that the Home Office says 
these powers are already available to us suggests our failure to enforce
 them should be taken as an indictment of the mandarin class.’

Another
 Tory MP, James Clappison, said: ‘This move drives a coach and horses 
through the freedom of movement principle and we should take inspiration
 from it.’

Spain is in the grip of its worst  economic crisis since the Forties and is almost certain to require a bailout in the coming weeks.

Official figures released on Friday show that unemployment has soared to a record 5.7 million – a staggering 24.6 per cent of the workforce.

The centre-right government of prime minister Mariano Rajoy has introduced the new controls in an attempt to cut expenditure on health and social services. Health minister Ana Mato said recently that 700,000 foreigners had moved to Spain just to obtain free health care.

The country has become a favourite destination for ‘health tourists’ from other EU countries, attracted by short waiting lists, cheap treatment and excellent hospitals.

Under EU law, citizens of member states are entitled to receive health care in any member country. But Spanish authorities say their finances are being drained by the arrangement, with local media claiming Britons are the worst offenders.

In contrast to the Spanish regulations, EU citizens coming to live in Britain do not need to register or take out health insurance. And the only requirement on those not in work is that they should not become an ‘unreasonable burden’ on public funds. A spokesman for the Spanish Embassy in London said: ‘You either must hold a job or have the means to support yourself to ensure that you do not become a burden on the Spanish state.

‘Those people who do not hold a job would have to show that they have contracted a medical insurance service to cover them during their stay in Spain, and also that they have the appropriate means to support themselves and any other member of their families. Pensioners do not need medical insurance.’

A Foreign Office spokesman said: ‘This change simply brings Spain in line with many other EU countries. The British Embassy has issued guidance in English for British expatriates in Spain via its website. We understand the new rules will affect a relatively small number of expatriates.’

A UK Border Agency spokesman said: ‘EU nationals who want to stay in the UK for more than three months must have proof they are working, studying or are self-sufficient.

‘Wherever we encounter someone breaking the rules, we will take steps to remove them.’

British holidaymakers would have borrowing limits on their credit cards lifted by the Government if they were caught up in the collapse of the euro, under new plans.

The move is one of a series of measures being considered by crisis- management teams in No 10, the Foreign Office and the Treasury following advice that Greece’s exit from the single currency is ‘near inevitable’ – and could come before the end of the summer-holiday season.

The deepening economic malaise on the Continent has led to the conclusion at the top of the Government that there will soon be an ‘orderly ejection’ of Greece from the euro – probably with only a few days’ notice.

If this ‘Grexit’ occurred in the height of the summer season, hundreds of thousands of British tourists could be stranded with euros that are no longer legal tender. Cash machines could freeze and credit-card companies are unlikely to process transactions.

The UK Government’s primary aim would be to avoid panic by allowing British tourists to remain in Greece until the end of their holiday.

Proposed measures include offering taxpayer-backed guarantees  to credit-card companies, enabling tourists to use the cards without  borrowing limits.

The companies would then be compensated for any losses. Euros could also be exchanged for Sterling on their return, with the British taxpayer again bearing the burden.

A Foreign Office source said: ‘We will have a key role to play in making sense of a confusing situation.’
