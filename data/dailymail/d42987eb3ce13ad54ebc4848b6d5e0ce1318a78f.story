A former professional racing driver who was sentenced to life in prison for running a massive international drug ring based in Florida is being released after serving 27 years behind bars.

An ailing Randy Lanier, 60 —  who won the IMSA GTP title in 1984 and was the Indianapolis 500 Rookie of the Year in 1986 — is being allowed to go home on Wednesday, Oct. 15, Autoweek first reported. 

Lanier was sentenced in Illinois Federal Court in 1988 after using the millions in gains from his drug operation to fund his racing career.

Randy Lanier drove this March-Chevrolet 83G in the SunBank 24 at Daytona and, along with his team, completed 131 laps and finished 63rd in 1984

Lanier was indicted in October 1986 for importing a whopping 600,000 pounds of marijuana from Colombia.

Prosecutors said he made $68 million in profits between 1982 and 1986.

'He was in the top five people in South Florida when it came to volume,' a retired drug enforcement agent told the Florida-based Gossip Extra. 

'We’re talking planes filled with the stuff coming in from Colombia.'

It is unclear why Lanier's life sentence — which had no possibility of parole — has been reduced.

His release papers have been sealed by a judge.

Once out of prison, Lanier will have to live in a halfway house for the first half-year of his release. He will be on supervised released for three years after that.

He has lined up a job at a South Florida classic car museum, according to Autoweek.
