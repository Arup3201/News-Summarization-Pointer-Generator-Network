The Tories’ biggest donor has stopped funding the party after privately questioning whether the Prime Minister is still a proper Conservative.

Lord Ashcroft, who has given the Tories £10million, has withdrawn support after becoming dismayed with David Cameron’s obsession with ‘fringe issues’ such as gay marriage.

The Tory peer also told friends he has given enough money and is not hopeful of the party winning a majority in 2015.

£10million man: Lord Ashcroft has stopped funding the Tories after privately questioning whether the Prime Minister is still a proper conservative

A source close to the Tory donor told the Daily Mail: ‘Lord Ashcroft is still a Tory but, he wonders, is Cameron?’

The source, himself a Tory donor, added: ‘Ashcroft does not agree with Cameron’s liberal approach to Conservatism. He thinks Cameron is too easily distracted by fringe issues which only the metropolitan elite care about, such as gay marriage.

‘He believes Cameron is unwilling to focus on the issues that matter, like cutting taxes and sorting out immigration, and therefore will not be able to deliver a clear Tory majority next time. A lot of the donors agree with Ashcroft that there is no strategic vision. What does Cameron’s Government stand for? Cameron seems oblivious to our concerns so it’s no wonder Ashcroft has stopped giving financial support. In fact he stopped writing cheques before the last election.’

In another blow to Mr Cameron, his local Chipping Norton party chairman, Cicely Maunder, quit her post and tore up her party membership over his promotion of gay marriage.

'Distracting influence': Lord Ashcroft was ignored when he warned that the appointment of Australian-born Lynton Crosby (pictured) as the PM's election guru would be a 'mistake'

Lord Ashcroft has urged the party to 
drop issues such as gay marriage, and focus instead on wooing the 
‘suspicious strivers’ – voters who would naturally be Conservative but 
feel the party has been taken over by those out of touch with their 
concerns.

And last year the
 businessman was ignored when he warned that the appointment of 
Australian-born Lynton Crosby as Mr Cameron’s election guru would be a 
‘mistake’.

Straight-talking Mr Crosby, who is credited with helping Boris Johnson secure a second term as London Mayor, would prove to be a ‘distracting influence’, Lord Ashcroft said.

Lord Ashcroft’s largesse has helped the party secure a series of marginal seats by master-minding their strategy and providing support to candidates. A source close to the billionaire businessman said: ‘He feels he has done his bit.’

However, he is still eager to provide support for individual candidates whose values he admires and will continue with his polling work and philanthropy.

Under Mr Cameron’s leadership of the party, Lord Ashcroft donated £4million between 2006 and 2009, becoming the party’s biggest donor. In total he has given more than £10million.

The Tory leadership has played down his withdrawal of funding, saying that he had not donated for the last few years.

But Michael Dugher, Labour’s vice chairman, said his withdrawal of financial support was ‘a damning vote of no confidence’ in the Prime Minister.

It comes as the chairman of Mr Cameron’s local party executive committee has quit in protest at the Government’s promotion of same sex marriage.

'Unwilling to focus on issues that matter': A source said that Lord Ashcroft thinks the PM is 'too easily distracted by fringe issues 'which only the metropolitan elite care about, such as gay marriage'

Yesterday Mrs Maunder, 64, said: ‘I left
 after 34 years because of David Cameron’s support for gay marriage. I 
have no choice but to feel strongly about it as a Christian believer. 
Other members walked out too. I’ve had a lot of support.’

She added: ‘ I renewed my party subscription a week before I resigned and received my membership card but I’ve now binned it. I’m a lifelong Conservative like my family before me. I’ve served the party half my life. I’ll be a non-voter now. It’s very sad.

‘I haven’t had a chance to talk to Mr Cameron about it but maybe I’ll see him shopping.’

She added: ‘I’m not anti-gay people at all. I fully agree with civil partnership rights. But most gay people will tell you that’s all they wanted and they don’t want gay marriage.’

A Tory source pointed out that Mrs Maunder was one of 22 branch chairs in the local association.
