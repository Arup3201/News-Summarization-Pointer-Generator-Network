A man in a small Michigan town is livid after he claims a St Louis police officer gunned down his beloved eight-year-old golden retriever. 

St. Louis police officer Matt Vanhall was on patrol in the small neighbourhood when he said the dog, Scout, darted in front of his police cruiser.

According to his report, Vanhall followed the dog who then began biting his leg. After the dog wouldn’t stop, Vanhall said he had no choice but to shoot him.

According to the Morning Sun, Vanhall’s shooting of Brian and Hillary Goetzinger’s prized pet turned the small town, located in the centre of the state, upside down.

One of the Goetzinger’s neighbours told local news station WNEM a different story. ‘I heart “pop pop pop pop pop,” and I thought what is going on here?’

She added: ‘He just started shooting (Scout,) he just kept shooting him in the head,’ Lori Walmsley said. 

She told the Sun that the only reason that Scout was growling in the first place was because he was upset at being forced to leave an area with which he was comfortable.

Scout was rushed to a veterinary clinic, but succumbed to his wounds.

Vanhall wrote in his report that at one point, the dog began chasing him. He said in his write-up: ‘The dog was in three feet of me and I was running a backwards circular motion so as not to turn my back on the dog.

'At this time,’ he continued, ‘I pulled my service weapon and rapidly fired seven shots while backing away from the dog as quickly as I could.’

Mr Goetzinger told WNEM that he couldn’t believe the events at his house over the weekend. ‘I just wouldn’t believe that, let alone the police were in my yard shooting anything, let alone my dog, who was sweet.’

He told the station that Scout had been a family pet for eight years and was very docile.

A spokesperson for the St. Louis police did not immediately return calls seeking comment placed by MailOnline.
