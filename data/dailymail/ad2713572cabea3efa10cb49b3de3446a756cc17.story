Arty pictures of coffee cups and holiday pictures on Instagram are set to be joined by adverts later this year, as the photo sharing service begins expanding its advertising trial.

Instagram announced it is rolling out the service to the UK, Canada and Australia over the coming months, having trialled the concept in the U.S. since November.

The company said advertisers had seen positive results ‘well above the industry’s average for performance’.

Adverts were first introduced to Instagram in the U.S. in November last year.

The adverts look like Instagram pictures posted by friends, but have 'Sponsored' written in the top right-hand corner.

Adverts can be hidden from a feed by clicking the 'More' button, which consists of three small circles.

Users can give feedback to companies about they liked or disliked a particular advert.

The first brands to sign up to the scheme were Adidas, Ben and Jerry's, Burberry, General Electric, Lexus, Levi's, Macy's, Michael Kors, PayPal and Starwood.

The company said that advertisers has seen positive results ‘well above the ad industry’s average for performance’.

Instagram was acquired by Facebook in 2012 for $1bn and has over 200million users across the globe.

The company said that it is ‘methodical and deliberate’ about choosing which brands pop up in users’ feeds.

There are strict rules that advertisers have to adhere to, such as no text to accompany images and no product shots.

Instead, images should capture ‘moments’. In short, the adverts are designed to look like they are posted by your friends.

Adverts being rolled out in the new regions are expected to follow the same format as those shown in the U.S.

And, if their introduction also follows suit, global Instagram users will initially rubbish the decision to introduce adverts, before accepting and even liking them, as seen with their U.S. counterparts.

Advertising consultancy eMarketer told BBC News
 that while almost 35 million people use the service in the U.S. and see
 adverts, most people sharing and editing photos on the site are not 
exposed to advertising.

Instagram began its advertising mission in the U.S. last autumn with a handful of partners including Adidas and Levis.

It is now working with 20 firms such as Ben & Jerry’s ice cream. A month's campaign is believed to cost up to $1million.
