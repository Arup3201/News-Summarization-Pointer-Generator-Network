'I'm no bunny-hugger': BBC Springwatch presenter Chris Packham says hunters should be allowed to pay to shoot deer and mink

Deer and mink should be shot and killed by fee-paying hunters, TV naturalist Chris Packham has said.

The BBC Springwatch presenter, who describes himself as a 'pragmatic conservationist', says hunters should be allowed to shoot the animals in areas of overpopulation.

He says that hunters and animal-lovers should put their differences aside to tackle the problem, Independent on Sunday reported

Mr Packham said: 'I can't understand why anyone would want to kill animals for fun, and anybody who dies, I think, is psychopathic.'

'But I'm not a bunny-hugger. Some areas would benefit from a reduction in deer or American mink because they have no natural predators and cause notable damage.

'I could see a creative partnership between the conservationists and the shooting fraternity.'

The American mink is considered to be bad for the environment because it kills water voles.

Deer, of which four of the six species in the UK are non-native, destroy the habitats of woodland birds and dormice.

Mr Packham called for a survey by environmentalists to find out the population sizes of deer and mink in different parts of the UK.

He believes this data should then be used to work out how many animals should be killed.

Animal welfare groups blasted the Springwatch presenter's controversial plan.

Conservationists called Mr Packham's plan to allow hunters to kill American mink 'massively disappointing' 

Jay Tiernan, spokesman for Stop the Cull, said: 'It's massively disappointing to have someone like Chris come up with an idea like that.

'It's a slippery slope. If you get into bed with people like that, they will make the most of it.'

The League Against Cruel Sports said three tests should be applied when considering controlling animal populations - the scientific evidence behind a cull, whether it is humane, and whether it is sustainable.

Chief executive Joe Duckworth said: 'The notion that culling could be carried out by hunters to satisfy their desire to kill these animals for sport, fails all three of these tests.'

However, the Countryside Alliance back Mr Packham's plan. A spokesman said: 'We are always keen to work with anyone genuinely interested in conservation.'  

Mink escaped from fur farms in the 1950s and 1960s and now breed across most of the country. 

They are active predators, feeding on anything they are big enough to catch, including native water voles, which are now under threat of extinction. 

They hunt on the riverbanks and are good swimmers, enabling them to enter the water-line burrows of water voles. 

Mink, which have a similar appearance to otters, but can be distinguished  by their smaller size, darker fur, and small white chin and throat.
