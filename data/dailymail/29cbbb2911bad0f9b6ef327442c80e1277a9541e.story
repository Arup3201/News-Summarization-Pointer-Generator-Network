Sentenced: Father-of-four Sorient Sigba, 54, was sentenced alongside two associates who ran upmarket Freddy's brothel at Southwark Crown Court

A school teacher who became a pimp was jailed for three years today after police infiltrated his £1million-a-year sex and drug den.

Father-of-four Sorient Sigba, 54, was sentenced alongside two associates who ran Freddy's, an upmarket brothel based in a central London mews house.

Customers, including bankers and other City workers, were ferried to the three-bedroom den by drivers waiting outside strip clubs.

Once there, they were encouraged to take cocaine, costing £60 for a wrap, in order to 'make the sex better'.

Clients ran up bills of up to £5,000-a-night, paying £300 for an hour with the venue's women, or £390 if they were paying with card.

Sigba, who once worked as a teacher at the Geoffrey Chaucer School in south London, was joined in the dock by Simon Earl, 58, and wine broker Michael Wallen, 50.

The court heard how the brothel's operations were 'divided between the three of them', with Sigba responsible for the 'girls and the drivers', Simon dealing with the 'flat and cards' and Wallen looking after the 'figures'.

The brothel, which was also run by madam Vera Fosuhene, 46,  turned over £946,776 in just nine months after the property was purchased in 2006.

Sigba, known as Freddy, was convicted of conspiracy to control prostitution for gain and conspiracy to transfer criminal property at Southwark Crown Court.

The ex-teacher, whose two children are studying law and medicine at university, was described in court as the 'front person at the brothel, engineering and orchestrating the income'.

Judge Jeremy McMullen said QC said: 'The operation 
itself is considerable. One has only to look at the accounts 
meticulously taken night-by-night to see the number of girls supplying 
their services and the hours which they worked - 10 to 15 girls a night 
each week.'

Earl, of Chislehurst, Kent,  was sentenced to two years in jail after pleading guilty, while Wallen, of Hackney, east London, was sentenced to two years and five months in jail after admitting conspiracy to transfer criminal property.

Crimes: The central London house in which the trio operated Freddy's brothel, where taxi drivers would bring customers from nearby strip clubs

In a text message to Sigba one 
customer wrote: 'I'm in the mood for a total f*** fest. Having two girls
who f*** like rabbits to get me in the mood would be good.'

An investigation by the 
Metropolitan Police's Human Exploitation and Organised Crime Command, 
undercover officers made three visits to the brothel before swooping.

Undercover vice cops, named only as 
'John' and 'Alex', visited the property after being 
approached by mini-cab drivers outside the City Burlesque club, in 
Farringdon.

During the first visit in July 2011, after 
the door to the brothel was opened by Fosuhene, the officers found five 
scantily-clad girls aged between 20 and 25.

During a second visit in October 2011
a Jaguar, later found to be registered to Sigba, was parked outside the
property and Sigba opened the door to the brothel.

Guilty: Sigba, who once worked as a teacher at the Geoffrey Chaucer School in south London, was sentenced alongside his associates, including brothel madame Vera Fosuhene, 46, right

Inside, the driver who brought the officer told Fosuhene he was 'looking for a real good party.'

When officers arrested Sigba at his 
office they found a hire purchase agreement for a 
Jaguar seen outside the mews house

A jury at Southwark Crown Court 
convicted Sigba of conspiracy to control prostitution for gain and 
conspiracy to transfer criminal property, while Earl, Wallen and 
Fosuhene all pleaded guilty to their roles.

Foshuene, of 
Croydon, Surrey, pleaded guilty to managing a brothel used for 
prostitution and two counts of supplying cocaine. She is due to be sentenced later this month.
