Taxidermy: A Swiss zoo which killed a healthy bear cub is now stuffing it (pictured) to teach children

A Swiss zoo which provoked outrage by killing a healthy bear cub is now stuffing it to teach children how cruel nature can be.

Known only as Cub Four, the three-month-old brown bear was put down to 'spare it any distress' when it started being bullied by its jealous father at Bern's Dahlholzli Zoo.

Now zoo bosses have hauled the cub's corpse out of a deep freezer and are stuffing it to create a display about the harsher facts of life.

A zoo spokesman said: 'The preparation of Cub Four was launched on Tuesday in the first stage.

'The deep-frozen bear was thawed overnight and X-rayed for scientific purposes. The award-winning taxidermist Sabrina Beutler separated the coat from the rest of the body, and it has been tanned.

'The carcass has been measured exactly and it will have lifelike realistic postures to reflect the beauty and perfection of the animal.

'The prepared cub will be used in the future for school purposes in the zoo's education.

'Active observation and experience of animals in their natural environment and understanding of skins, bones or whole-body preparations are particularly important.

'The emphasis here is an emotional experience, in which nature with all its facets - 'beautiful' or not - can be brought closer and made more tangible for children.'

The bear will be stuffed using the dermoplastic method, which involves draping the animal's tanned skin over an artificial, stylised body.

Cub Four was one of two born at Dahlholzli Zoo in January to Misha and Masha, who were gifts from then-Russian president Dmitry Medvedev in 2009.

But the relationships within the bear family went awry when Misha, the male, brutally killed Cub Four's sibling Cub Three in April.

To the outrage of campaigners, keepers refused to separate the animals even after the killing in front of horrified families.

Distress: The cub, nicknamed Cub Four, was not separated from its father even after its twin Cub Three was killed in the enclosure. It is common for males and even females to kill their own cubs

Keepers claimed the mother of the cub, right, was neglecting it and they could not account for nature's course

When 360kg male Misha started being aggressive towards Cub Four a week later, zoo chiefs decided to kill the cub instead of raising it in solitude.

Swiss Animal Protection, the country's oldest and largest animal rights group, was in uproar.

A Danish zoo sparked international outrage after killing an 18-month-old giraffe to prevent inbreeding - then dissecting it in public.

Copenhagen Zoo killed Marius with a bolt gun, dissected him before a crowd and fed him to lions earlier this year, drawing criticism from animal rights campaigners around the world.

But the controversy did not stop there. Shortly afterwards the zoo euthanised four lions.

It condemned the action in the 'strongest possible terms' and said the zoo had massively 
mishandled the situation.

A
 spokesman for the group added: 'It is not natural to keep the male bear 
with the offspring, and there was more than enough space to have kept 
him in a separate part of the cage.'

In
 the wild, female bears typically drive away males to protect cubs because
males can see them as rivals and try to kill them.

Despite this, the zoo defended its position even after the first cub was killed last Wednesday.

Keepers said separating Misha or Masha from their cub would lead to other problems, and cause lasting damage for the welfare of all the bears involved.

JÃ¼rg Hadorn, the zoo's deputy 
director, said in April: 'After 12 weeks it was clear that Masha was 
irreparably neglecting her role as mother of cub number four.

'Together
 with the fact that the male bear Misha had started demonstrating the 
same aggressive behaviour as he did to cub number three, in order to 
protect cub number four from more stress and pain, we decided to act. As
 a result the baby bear was euthanised by a vet.

Attack: Horrified families looked on as Misha killed the first of the cubs, Cub Three, pictured. Males often turn against their cubs because they see them as competition, and even females can attack their young

Killed: Cub Three being mauled by its father in April. A week later, Cub Four was put down

'It remains unclear now as then as to why our bears behaved in this way. After killing cub number three on April 2 there was an uneasy truce for 48 hours but since the weekend Misha again started to show the same aggression.

'Misha and Masha are lovely hand-reared orphaned bears who came to us in 2009. They never had the chance to learn from other bears how to behave and their mothers were killed by poachers.

'We have tried when they were here to
 keep as much distance between them and humans as possible. Our priority
 is the two adult bears.

'Having
 young animals is a natural part of the life cycle of every animal and 
we wanted to ensure that Misha and Masha had the chance as well.

'But
 the loss of the young animals in a biological sense and also according 
to basic principles of good animal protection are less serious than the 
loss of an adult.

Euthanised: The cub put down by the zoo (pictured) was born in January and was one of two

Expert: Brown bear specialist Prof Djuro Huber said bears' natural aggression was well-known and it was 'a shame to allow the male to kill his cub in the zoo'

'Because Misha and Masha appeared to be clearly unable to fulfil their role as parents, Misha will be sterilised.'

He
 added he did not want to see a repeat of Knut the polar bear, who was 
effectively sentenced to a life of solitude in a Berlin zoo after being 
rejected by his mother.

In 2007, an animal rights activist controversially said Knut should have been killed rather than being held in captivity alone.

Yet
 when two cubs were born at another Swiss zoo in January this year, 
keepers solved the problem by separating the parents and leaving the 
cubs with their mother.

Ursina gave birth to King and Zoe at Juraparc animal park near Vallorbe, just 60 miles from Bern.

Professor
 Djuro Huber, chairman of the brown bear expert team for the 
International Union for the Conservation of Nature, said bears' natural 
aggression was well-known and it was 'a shame to allow the male to kill 
his cub in the zoo'.

Different policy: Sixty miles away, two cubs born at the Juraparc animal park were separated from their father

Happy family: A cub in Jaraparc with its mother. The Bern zoo said it was worse to lose an adult than a cub

He told
 MailOnline during the controversy in April: 'In nature the male bear 
separates from the female after mating season and is not present with 
his cubs.

'It is not unusual that the male kills his cubs in captivity. Even the mother sometimes does.'

But he added: 'Zoos have too many captive bears and it is almost impossible to send them somewhere. Surplus bears have to be euthanised, and it is better to do that at a very young age when the mortality in nature is also the highest.'
