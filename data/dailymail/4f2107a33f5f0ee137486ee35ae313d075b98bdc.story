She's a magician by day and a princess by night.

From her sparkling ball gowns, glittering shoes and tiaras to high top hats, playing cards and wands – the royal Aussie princess and self-taught magician is living in a real life fairy tale.

It’s a lifestyle that Rita Barbagallo, from Blakehurst in southern Sydney, has been embracing for more than 20 years.

After suffering a life-threatening illness in her teens, the 47-year-old was determined to live her life to the full.

Meet Rita Barbagallo - When she isn't living the princess lifestyle, the 47-year-old visits hospitals to entertain the sick children and put a smile back on their faces

She works as a magical children’s entertainer Barbee Barb across the globe, pulling magic tricks from everyone’s sleeves at kids's parties and putting a smile on sick children’s faces in hospitals.

'Life's too short,' she told Daily Mail Australia.

‘I visit a lot of hospitals to entertain sick kids and put a smile to their little faces – it makes my day.

‘I remember going through some tough times. I had a life-threatening illness during my teens and early 20’s. That’s when I decided if I ever get out of this bed, I’ve got to help other people.

‘A promise is a promise and you can’t go back on a promise once you get better. It made me realise how lucky we are and I've been fortunate to have those little luxuries in my life.'

Barbagallo said she had a fairytale ceremony and designed her own dress - measured at 8.2 metres long

Rita and husband Salvatore celebrated their 25th anniversary in Thailand by renewing their marriage vows

Inside her three-tier waterfront palace in Sydney, Barbagallo lives with her prince charming husband Salvatore, 57, who works as a real estate financier, and assists her shows when he's not working.

The couple recently returned home from Thailand after celebrating their 25th anniversary by renewing their marriage vows.

‘We had a fairytale ceremony in Phuket,’ she said.

‘I designed my own dress and it measured 8.2 metres – number eight because it means infinity and doesn’t have an end and it’s always been my favourite number - and two for the two of us.

‘It was worth $35,000 and the lace alone cost $2,500 per metre but we’re looking at putting it up for auction and donating the money to charity.'

In her spare time, Barbagallo goes through her closet to donate all her unwanted clothing and accessories to churches and the less fortunate families.

'When I travel overseas, I always pack two luggage - one to give away and one for my holiday. I like to share my nice things to others, especially those who can't afford clothes.

'At my last clean-out, I counted 40 wedding dresses, 200 ball gowns, 500 pairs of shoes and 100 handbags. There's a lot of things that are just sitting on my shelves. 

'I've always looked after all my things but I've given most away because I know someone else might like them.'

The self-confessed princess said she has been embracing her lifestyle choices for more than 20 years

Barbagallo has travelled to over 60 countries - She added a special needs school in Phuket recently

She said she dedicates at least one full day helping children in need and doing charity work

And like the royal Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, the Aussie couple has worked with several charities and are set to launch their very own foundation called Barbee Barb.

‘I’ve travelled to over 60 countries and every time I travel, I make sure I dedicate at least one full day doing charity work. Our ceremony was close to Mother’s Day over in Thailand – so we donated all our flowers from our ceremony to a nursing home and an autistic school,’ she said.

‘We had 100,000 flowers at our ceremony and we used it all to decorate their foyers and make it nice and beautiful for their loved ones to visit – it was lovely.

‘On top of that, we had a wishing well and proceeds was spent on nappies, shampoo, toothpastes and brushes for the elderly. There are so many people who don’t have the simple things in life so we just got to give back.

‘And we will continue to help kids and adults when we launch our new foundation soon – pay for children's medical procedures, wheel chairs and meals for the elderly - things like that.'

The couple have never had children of their own but they live with their pomeranian named Brandi and a cat called Cleopatra.

'We've never had any kids but we've got each other. I love kids but our life is complete and we can do our own little things to help others in need,' she told Daily Mail Australia.

Barbagallo grew up on a Central Coast farm in Mangrove Mountain with her six sisters and one brother in a close knit home.

'I grew up on a farm and worked each day - driving tractors and trucks - it was tough work but our family lifestyle was just perfect.

'I'm a country girl at heart and mum used to call me her little princess.'

Rita Barbagallo loves to dress up her beloved pomeranian  named Brandi in cute little dresses 

As she lives her glamorous lifestyle, Barbagallo laughs and says most people in her area know her as the 'Barbie' lady.

'They don't know my name but I'm always dressed in bright colours and I drive a Barbie-mobile but  it doesn't bother me when people give me strange looks,' she said.

'My husband has always supported me and he lets me be me. He gets me and he will never try to change who I am. Sal knew who I was before he married me.

'In fact, he has started to wear some bling and his clothing are getting a little bit out there. I don't think I could imagine him wearing the stuff now when we first met but I'm happy because we're both comfortable in our own skins.'

While she continues to entertain children and run her own magic workshops across the globe, Barbagallo said she won't be retiring any time soon.

‘I’d be an old duck before I give up,' she laughed.

'As long as my ears can still hear and my eyes can still see – I'll continue to make kids laugh and smile for as long as I can.'
