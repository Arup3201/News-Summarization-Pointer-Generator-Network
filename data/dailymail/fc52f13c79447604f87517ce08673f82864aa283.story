The prime suspect in the murder of schoolgirl Alice Gross walked into a homeless shelter with her body in a bag, a hostel manager has claimed.

Steven Mendonca described how convicted killer Arnis Zalkalns begged for his help while trying to enter a hostel in Harlesden, North London.

He claimed that the Latvian builder was carrying a heavy, 5ft-long bag over his shoulders.

Mr Mendonca, 33, told The Sun: 'I am convinced Alice's body was in that bag. It was like a builder's bag with a big strap and it was weighing him down.'

The incident took place on September 5 - just one day after Zalkalns was reported missing and 10 days before he was named as a prime suspect in the 15-year-old's disappearance. 

Zalkalns was found dead in Boston Manor Park, west London, on October 4. 

Four days earlier the teenager's body was pulled from a river less than 30 minutes walk from the hostel.

Mr Mendonca, who reported his exchange to the police, claimed that Zalkans begged to be let in but that he turned him away because there were no rooms at the hostel. 

He said: 'He had this cold, chilling look about him. He was in a trance. Something about him made me feel uneasy.'

He added: 'What I find incredible is he managed to walk around for nine days after the murder unnoticed by the police.'

Alice Gross was last seen on CCTV walking along the Grand Union Canal in Hanwell on August 28.

Zalkalns was seen on video footage cycling along the same towpath minutes after Alice. He went missing from his home in Hanwell days later.

The teenager's disappearance sparked a large scale police search that involved 17 other police forces.

The search was the largest operation that Scotland Yard has carried out since the aftermath of the July 7 bombings an involved around 600 officers, including underwater experts from five forces and victim detection dogs and handlers from four outside the Met.

The 15-year-old's body was found by London Fire Brigade divers on September 30, wrapped in a plastic bag and weighted down in a shallow stretch of the River Brent.

She was identified using dental records and a post-mortem examination proved inconclusive, a brief hearing in to her death heard earlier this month.

After their daughter's body was discovered Rosalind Hodgkiss and Jose Gross, said they had been left 'completely devastated' by her death. 

The statement added: 'Why anyone would want to hurt her is something that we are struggling to come to terms with.

'Alice was a loving and much-loved daughter and sister, a quirky live spark of a girl, beautiful inside and out.

'She was a funny companion, a loyal friend, both passionate and compassionate, and so talented, with a bright future ahead of her. She brought so much joy to our family and those who knew her.

'We still don't know who is responsible for this crime and we ask that people continue to help the police by giving them information that could help bring the perpetrator to justice.

Zalkalns was named as the prime suspect in the case as police tried to find the teenager's murderer. His body was found four days after her body was retrieved.

The Latvian had served seven years in prison for bludgeoning and stabbing his wife Rudite to death.

He worked as a general labourer at a building site in Isleworth, west London and is believed to have come to the UK in 2007. 

But authorities in Britain are thought to have had no record of his murder conviction.
