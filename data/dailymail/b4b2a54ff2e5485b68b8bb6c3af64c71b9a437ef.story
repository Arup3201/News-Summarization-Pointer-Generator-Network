A furious Gordon Brown yesterday attacked David Cameron’s English votes plan and warned he was jeopardising the ‘still fragile’ Union.

In an outspoken attack on his successor, the former Prime Minister accused the Tories of playing into the Nationalists’ hands and warned: 'Nations can be lost by accident.'

He warned that their income tax proposals were ‘100 per cent wrong’ and risk destroying Scotland’s relationship with the rest of the UK.

Mr Brown wrestled back the referendum debate after a late surge by the separatists last month and – despite not being nominated by Labour to be part of the Smith Commission on new powers for Scotland – has submitted his own personal views.

He believes Scotland should be responsible for raising 54 per cent of the money it spends but rejects Tory proposals to give it complete control of income tax.

‘It just does not make sense to devolve 100 per cent of income tax to the Scottish parliament,’ the Labour MP for Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath said yesterday.

‘The Conservatives have got this wrong. They are 100 per cent wrong.

‘They’ve got to understand that their measures are a gift to the separatists, they would play into the hands of the Nationalist party.

‘They would drive a wedge between Scotland and England and make the constitution unstable.

‘I will be saying that during the course of this week when I put forward my own proposals about how to solve this problem. I think what the Conservatives have to realise is what is at stake here is the future of the UK. It’s still fragile.

‘There are grievances as a result of what Mr Cameron said the day after the referendum. I think he did so in an unstatesmanlike way and he should regret what he did.’

He added: ‘I think the Conservatives have to think again about playing fast and loose with the constitution. Nations can be lost by accident; unions can disintegrate because mistakes were made.’

Just hours after Scots decisively rejected independence, Mr Cameron linked the promise of further powers for Holyrood with English votes for English laws south of the Border. The proposals would limit the role of Scots MPs in English issues that have been devolved – such as health and education.

It would cause huge problems for Labour, which has 41 Scots MPs. It could be in power in Westminster but in a minority in England.

Mr Brown fears that the full devolution of income tax would further limit the role of Scots MPs and make it easier for the SNP to argue for independence.

In his submission to the commission, he warns: ‘Full devolution of income tax rates and bands does not sit easily with the wish to maintain the Union and to prevent a wedge being driven between Scotland and England.

‘Our Union is based on the pooling and sharing of resources and that is why the UK Government – with its responsibilities for macroeconomic management and redistribution – must play a role in relation to income tax.

‘Leaving Parliament at Westminster with no influence over income tax in Scotland could undermine the political union, by calling into question the legitimacy of tax decisions which today affect the whole UK.’

Nicola Sturgeon has claimed the Smith Commission should deliver everything except foreign affairs and defence – far more than any party set out before the referendum.

‘Their plan adds up to separation by another route,’ Mr Brown said at the weekend.

The Scots Tories – who are represented by former leader Annabel Goldie and Professor Adam Tomkins on the commission – have indicated they are prepared to add to their offer by saying it represents ‘a floor, not a ceiling’.

A party spokesman said: ‘We think income tax should be devolved with no strings attached and look forward to trying to persuade others – including Mr Brown – of that case.

‘We go into these negotiations open-minded and have made clear that the Strathclyde proposals are very much a basis rather than a limit. These proposals were meticulously considered over the course of more than a year and we are confident they are the best way forward.’

Meanwhile, the SNP believes Mr Brown has backtracked on his rhetoric before the referendum, when he talked of a ‘modern form of Scottish home rule’. Pete Wishart, Nationalist MP for Perth and North Perthshire, described Mr Brown’s contributions to the debate on Scotland’s future as ‘increasingly surreal’ and ‘full of inconsistencies and contradictions’.

He said: ‘Before the referendum, Gordon Brown posed as a guarantor of the “vow” – the promise to deliver wide-ranging new powers to Holyrood – but then resorted to asking people to sign a petition to ensure its delivery.

‘He is now calling on other Westminster parties to do more – but his own party’s proposals for more powers are even weaker than the Tories’ or the Liberal Democrats’.

‘Mr Brown attacks plans to give Scotland all control of income tax, even suggesting they are a “Trojan horse” to deliver full fiscal autonomy – but if he was in any way consistent with the pre-referendum vow to the people of Scotland, he would be throwing all his weight behind full fiscal autonomy for Holyrood.’
