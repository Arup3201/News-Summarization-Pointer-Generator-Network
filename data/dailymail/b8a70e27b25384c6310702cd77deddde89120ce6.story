Journalist Sophie Woolley who, after being profoundly deaf for several years, regained her hearing thanks to a cochlear implant

My hands were shaking as I dialled my husband's number. It had, after all, been almost ten years since I'd last heard Tom's voice.

'Hello Sophie,' he said, sounding just as he had the first time we met, at a party in 2000. We both started to laugh with joy, so loudly that I nearly missed hearing him say: 'I love you.'

Those words usually passed between us in sign language. I had been profoundly deaf for several years, and we had come to rely on signing to communicate.

Tom's voice wasn't the only sound I'd missed desperately in that time. I missed hearing my dad play his violin, the splashing of water in a shower, even hearing myself sing.

I could hear when I was born but began to go deaf in my teens. As I approached my 40th birthday last summer, I was somewhere between profoundly and totally deaf.

But the flick of a techno-switch on the cochlear implant fitted in my skull finally transported me back to a lost world; a place where cats purred, sirens screeched and pebbles clinked on the beach.

Although my deafness is genetic and runs through generations of my family, in my 20s I remained in denial. I had a degree, friends, boyfriends and a career as a journalist, scriptwriter and actress. Audiology tests were an advance warning but I refused hearing aids; I just wanted someone to turn up the volume.

By my late 20s, denial had turned to despair. Like all deafened people I would bluff when I couldn't hear and swiftly change the subject of conversations I couldn't follow.

As a journalist, I was winging my way through interviews with a tape recorder customised for my failing ears. At night I performed my own material in nightclubs, and at literary events that were noisy I reckoned no one else could hear much either.

But I sensed impending doom and clung to friends, fearful that soon I'd  be unable to hear them.

Romance was hard, too. You can't go on a casual date when small talk is impossible.

When I met Tom, an engineer, through friends, he had to learn sign language to get to know me. Even in the early days when we still communicated verbally, whispered sweet nothings were tricky.

I hated weddings because I was surrounded by people I loved but couldn't understand. So when it came to my own wedding, we 'eloped' to a register office in East London.

We've left it a bit late to have children. If we ever do, there is a 50-50 chance our son or daughter will go deaf when they grow up. But at least they will have the chance to hear again, thanks to cochlear implants.

It was around the time our relationship became serious that I stopped being able to use a phone. Hearing aids saved me for a while, making the most of the dwindling sound I could pick up, but I had to lip-read in tandem with them, which I found crushingly exhausting.

By 2008 I was in shock, feeling the last remnants of my hearing self slipping away.

Even with hearing aids, the only sounds I could discern were muffled, as if I were under water. Inside my head was a cacophony of small noises from tinnitus, the result of my brain making up sounds of its own. It is a common misunderstanding that deaf people live in silence.

I often felt isolated and moody, and focused on my career. I toured with my plays, wrote scripts, even founded a theatre company. I had radio plays broadcast and played Gabby in the Channel 4 series Cast Offs.

It was in 2011 that my audiologist suggested I might be eligible for a cochlear implant. This would mean inserting electrodes into my cochlea - part of the inner ear - to send signals to my brain, enabling me to hear again.

I would have a small headpiece and a processor over my ear, the receiver a tiny computer set into my skull. But there was a risk: if the implant failed, it would destroy any tiny bit of hearing I had left. The biggest terror, however, was daring to hope.

I had the 90-minute operation in July this year. I had to wait 30 days before the implant could be switched on to give the wound time to heal and the device a chance to settle in.

Tom was working on the day I had to go back to hospital, so my mum and sister came with me. They are both deaf and don't have implants. A doctor once told my mum she should get sterilised to avoid passing on the deaf gene.

Because we grow up hearing and then go deaf, my family are proud of both parts of ourselves. None of us expected to hear again, so what has happened to me in the past month has been an incredible journey for us all. When the doctor turned on the implant, I felt like a radio being tuned. At first all I could hear were computer noises. Then I heard my own voice, followed by my mother's; the sound of my childhood.

'I was so excited at the idea of being an ordinary wife on the phone to her husband, I thought I might burst with joy'

My implant bleeped and squeaked as it began finding the right frequencies, but I didn't care. I was overawed.

Tom had taken two weeks off to care for me after surgery but then had to go away for work. As soon as I left the hospital after my switch-on, I called him.

I was so excited at the idea of being an ordinary wife on the phone to her husband, I thought I might burst with joy.

Those first few days were far from perfect. People's voices veered from Minnie Mouse to Barry White, with special effects by The Clangers. But I gorged myself on sound: everything from Elgar's Cello Concerto In E Minor to synthesiser music.

It was everyday sounds that made the most difference. I could telephone my friends. I could hear the radio, tannoy announcements, the doorbell ringing, my own footsteps.

After just ten days I was at the stage most people reach at six weeks, and was delighted when an audiology test gave me slightly below-normal hearing.

I thanked my specialist, then burst into tears. In the pyramid of human need, communication comes first and music is a luxury, but I had rediscovered both and it has been life-changing.

In the three weeks since then, my sense of reawakening has grown exponentially. I've been stunned at how chatty people are. I love talking to strangers.

I have music on my iPod - friends have given me their playlists from the past decade or more, so I can catch up.

People say things as they walk away, with their backs turned - and I hear. Life feels faster, warmer, more connected.

People ask me if a cochlear implant is a cure. It's not. When I take my headset off at night, I return to total deafness.

In fact, my brain has stopped making noise for itself so  my quiet is quieter than it has ever been - for which I am  very grateful.

When I was deaf, I used to have dreams in which I could hear. Now, if I have such a dream tonight, I will wake tomorrow knowing that it has come true.
