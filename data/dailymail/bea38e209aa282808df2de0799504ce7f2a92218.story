A pensioner knifed her husband in the stomach in an attempt to ‘shut him up’ after a blazing row about how to operate a digital camera.

Barbara Smith, 72, stabbed husband John, 83, with a six-inch knife after a ‘childish’ bust-up over the complicated device escalated into violence.

When officers arrived she told them she was not attempting to murder him but was instead just trying to keep him quiet.

Row: The incident happened after Barbara Smith and her husband John argued over a digital camera (stock image from library). The court heard how she reached into a kitchen drawer, grabbed a knife and stabbed him

Bristol Crown Court heard how she reached into a kitchen drawer while they were face-to-face, grabbed the knife and stabbed him.

Mark Hollier, prosecuting, said the couple had been married for 53 years and both had digital cameras, but Mr Smith was not very good with his.

‘They got into a confrontation after a comment over nothing,’ he said.

‘They got into a row, the argument moved around the property and into the kitchen. Mr Smith was arguing with his wife and she took his camera and threw it on the floor.’

The court heard as Mr Smith confronted his wife she grabbed a blade from a drawer, lashed out and stabbed him in the stomach area.

She told the court: ‘He kept on moving closer. I could feel him spitting on my face. We were only inches apart. He kept coming towards me.’

Injured: Mr Smith was taken to Frenchay Hospital in Bristol with a small bowel perforation

Mr Hollier said: ‘She was clearly shocked. She telephoned her daughter-in-law, Susan Smith, and said she stabbed her husband. She also called for an ambulance.’

Susan Smith found him trying to staunch a bleeding stomach wound with a towel, as paramedics and police raced to the scene.

Mrs Smith told police: ‘He just wouldn’t be quiet. Are you going to take me to prison now?

‘I wasn’t trying to murder him. I was just trying to shut him up.’

Mr
Smith was taken to Frenchay Hospital, Bristol, had surgery to repair a 
small bowel perforation and stayed in for a fortnight, the court heard.

He
accepted he behaved in a ‘belligerent manner’ and he should have known 
better and was extremely supportive of his wife, the court heard.

Smith, of Aldwick, Bristol, pleaded guilty to wounding in August.

Sentencing her to eight months behind bars, suspended for 12 months, Mr Justice Nigel Teare said there was a degree of provocation.

He told her: ‘In judgement this was an offence of greater harm but lower culpability, because of the degree of provocation and lack of pre-meditation.

‘Sentencing guidelines start at 18 months’ custody. You are plainly not dangerous. There are powerful mitigating circumstances.’

She was also handed a £100 victim surcharge.

Tristan Harwood, defending, said his client told police she had suffered anger and threats from her husband for many years.

He told the court said: ‘This is domestic abuse. She has suffered at his hands for many years.’

Detective Constable Darren Ash, the police officer in charge of the case, said: ‘Mr Smith said there was an argument and he should have just sat down. He said it was a petty argument and he was being childish. He was trying to get help with his camera and his frustration just came out.

‘They have been married 53 years and he said his home would not be home without her.’
