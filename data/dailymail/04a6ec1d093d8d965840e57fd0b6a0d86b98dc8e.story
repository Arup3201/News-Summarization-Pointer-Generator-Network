Tenant from hell: Rose Chimuka arriving at Croydon Crown Court

An asylum seeker has been jailed for four years after ripping off landlords in a housing scam that netted her £100,000.

Zimbabwe-born Rose Chimuka took leases on family homes across south London then illegally divided them into bedsits and sublet them to dozens of desperate tenants.

The 32-year-old packed up to 15 people into each house, pocketing the rents and giving the real landlords nothing.

Each time she was found out, Chimuka would disappear and start again elsewhere.

The fraudster used fake IDs to convince landlords she was a respectable mother with a well-paid husband.

Once she took possession of properties she changed all the locks to keep their real owners out and put beds in every room to maximise the rental value.

After being packed with so many tenants, houses were left filthy, smelly and stripped of appliances and valuables.

Lost rent and the cost of repairs cost owners up to £86,000 each, The Sun reported.

Arriving to check on his property, the owner of one house in Brockley found it stuffed with tenants who thought Chimuka was the real landlady.

She even reported another homeowner to police when he tried to gain access to his house.

After being convicted of 11 counts of fraud, Chimuka was jailed at Croydon Crown Court.

She will be deported after she completes her sentence.
