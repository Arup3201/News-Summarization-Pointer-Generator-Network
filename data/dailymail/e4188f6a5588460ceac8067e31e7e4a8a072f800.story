Politics as usual: Tito Jackson Jr, mayor of Bogota, New Jersey, claims he was punched in the face by a rival's 80-year-old father outside a polling station

A small-town New Jersey mayor claims he was punched in the face by a political rival's octogenarian father after voting in Tuesday's election.

Tito Jackson Jr, the mayor of Bogota, New Jersey, has filed a complaint with the local police accusing Salvatore Trotta of assaulting him outside the polling station.

‘I cast my vote, he was waiting by my car, he shook my hand and wouldn't let go of my hand,’ Mr Jackson told PolitickerNJ.

Jackson, a Democrat, and Mr Trotta got into a shoving match until the elderly man punched the mayor in the face.

Trotta, 80, is the father of Tina Trotta, who is running for a city council seat against a crop of candidates supported by Mayor Jackson. 

Ms Trotta is also a plaintiff in a lawsuit asking the borough of Bogota to replace dozens of trees that had been chopped down to make way for a parking lot.

Following the incident, Jackson, who is married and has a daughter in her early 20s, said that his much older opponent did not beat him up, but delivered a single blow to his face.

‘He took my phone out of my hand and punched me,’ Jackson summed up. ‘I'm not hurt. My face is a little swollen.’

However, Salvatore Trotta presented his own version of events differing from the mayor’s.

The 80-year-old claimed that he struck Mayor Jackson in self-defense outside the polling place.

Mr Trotta explained that he approached Jackson, the two men shook hands, and he asked the mayor if he had cut down trees in a parking lot.

In response, the mayor allegedly told Trotta: 'Your daughter is nothing but a money-hungry piece of s***.' 

Some more words were exchanged, after which Trotta claims Jackson shoved him.

‘He jumped all over me. I went back two feet,’ said Tina Trotta’s father, who worked in the securities industry until his retirement.

The 80-year-old man says he plans to file his own complaint with police accusing Mayor Jackson of assault.

Tito Jackson was appointed last November and is now seeking the Democratic nomination for a one-year term to continue as mayor.
