She was working full-time in a demanding job while raising her two young boys on her own, but that didn't stop Sophie Guidolin from transforming her life.

Five years ago and 28 kilograms heavier than she is now, Sophie was unhealthy and exhausted, and had never stepped foot in a gym in her life.

Eating a lot of processed food while trying to maintain her energy and a balance in her life, the busy mum decided something had to give.

'I was never overweight before I had the boys, (but) when I was pregnant I put on 28 kilos, and that's when I really realised I needed to make a change,' the 25-year-old told Daily Mail Australia.

The mum of two started exercising by simply going for a run while pushing her two boys in their pram

Sophie started with cardio exercise first, and would take her sons out in the pram for a jog. Then once the weight started to shift she would get up at 4am in the morning and work out at home before heading off to a full day at her job.

She used anything she would get her hands on in the house to train with, and soon the results really started to show.

'I would use stairs at the house, do step ups on chairs, fill water bottles up and use them as weights', Sophie revealed.

'I would try and utilise anything I could.' 

About 18 months after she first decided to get healthy, Sophie signed up the gym for the first time in her life.

'I had never really been into a gym before I had my kids, I had never stepped into a gym.'

While training one day she was approached by a coach who offered to sponsor her so she could compete in a bodybuilding competition.

When Sophie said she didn't think it was for her, he gave her another option. 

'He said "okay, I'll train you for six months and if you don't want to hop on stage you don't have to".

'But by the time six months came around I was so confident, I hopped on stage and I won, then I went on to nationals and I won nationals,' Sophie said.

Her most recent title is from the Arnold Classic held in Ohio- one of the most prestigious competitions worldwide - where Sophie placed fifth overall. 

'Competing was never really my goal, it sort of just fell into my lap,' she revealed. 

Sophie said bodybuilding 'sort of fell into my lap' but despite this she won the first competition she  entered

In March the mum-of-two placed fifth in the Arnold Classic held in Ohio - one of the world's most prestigious competitions

After she had built up some cardio endurance, Sophie would get up at 4am to work out before heading to an eight hour day at her job 

Although Sophie acknowledged that exercise was crucial to her transformation, she said there's nothing better in the world you can do for yourself than 'eat clean'.

'When I started implementing the nutrition changes that's when the weight really dropped off.'

 

For the most part, Sophie's family consumes only food they have made themselves, the bulk of which is prepared twice a week - on a Sundays and Wednesdays. 

Her kids - now six and seven - help make and pack their own school lunches, and Sophie said she likes the keep them involved in the whole process.

'We go to the markets, we get what they want and they're there form the beginning,' she said. 

'Rye bread wraps with chicken or lamb and salad they'll make that themselves.'

Sweet potato chips and homemade roll-ups made in a dehydrator also pop up in the kids' lunchboxes, as well as banana bread and blueberry muffins. 

But this has caused some clashes in the past, and one particular confrontation with her eldest son's first pre-school comes to mind for Sophie. 

'My eldest son had started kindergarten and I sent him to school with some healthier options, but when I picked him up I had a little fine for a $6 lunch voucher because they had to give him lunch.'

'He had quinoa bread and banana bread... They said to me that unfortunately it doesn't meet their nutritional needs and he couldn’t eat it,' Sophia said.

Getting the kids involved is also a great way to keep them occupied while you work out

The mum-of-two said while she was never overweight, she felt slow and her energy levels were nowhere near where they are today

Getting the whole family involved is a great way to get active and outdoors, like taking a bike ride or going for a hike Sophie said

Homemade blueberry muffins was also off the cards according to the school, who told her the nutritional requirements were that children bring a sandwich with a spread, e.g. Vegemite, honey, or jam.

Sophie was also accused of sending her son to school with nuts, despite quinoa being a grain.

'I pulled them out of that kindy, for obvious reasons', she laughed.

One a more serious note she added: 'I think that they need to put more guidelines in place including options that mums can send in to schools that are nutritious.'

With one book already under her belt, Eat Clean Live Lean, and another due for release this month, My Kids Eat, Sophie said the key to maintaining a balanced and healthy lifestyle comes down to preparation.

'Buy everything in bulk, there's quite a few health food stores where you can buy kilos of things especially things like dates.

'Always buy in season, that's so important. 

'And everyone always says they're too scared to buy my cookbooks because they think they need special equipment. The only thing that I recommend is a good food processor,' Sophie said.

Some of her other top tips for busy mums included not doing the groceries hungry, always buy fresh produce in season, and ditching the coffee dates for the beach instead. 

'Instead of catching up for coffee or dinner I try and catch up with friends by going to beach, walk, bike, hike. Don't base your social life around food,' Sophie said.

She acknowledged that exercise was crucial to her transformation, she said there's nothing better in the world you can do for yourself than 'eat clean'

The mum said preparation and organisation is the key to leading a successful healthy lifestyle

Sophie and her husband - also a champion bodybuilder - now run a gym and coaching busines

Now working as a coach herself at her husband's gym, the busy mum said she has no plans to return to competition just yet.

'I just have so many beautiful girls I'm training at the moment and I don't want to do that to them,' Sophie laughed.

She stressed to all the busy mums - and others -out there, you certainly don't need a gym membership to lead an active lifestyle. Sophie still trains at home when she needs to, and even incorporates her kids during school holidays.

'We have 15 litre water container bottles and I will hold that and do lunges, squats, sit ups, anything,' she revealed.

'I will even use my boys as weights,' Sophia said.

'(Plus) lot of my exercise now is fun-based, they're (her kids) at the age now where we go for bike rides, go for a surf, the boys like to kick a foot around at the part, that sort of thing.
