Oliver Downes has avoided jail after admitting making and possessing indecent images of children

A Birmingham grammar school teacher has avoided jail after admitting making indecent images of children.

Oliver Downes was suspended from Bishop Vesey Grammar School in Sutton Coldfield, after police began an investigation into the allegations  last year.

The 40-year-old, who had been teaching and coaching rugby for 13 years, resigned shortly after in July.

A spokesman for the prestigious school, whose former pupils include TV presenter Cat Deeley, said that none of their pupils had been involved in the offences.

Downes appeared at Birmingham Crown Court where he pleaded guilty to nine counts of making indecent images of children and nine counts of possessing indecent images of children.

He had also admitted production of a Class B drug, cannabis.

In a statement after the court case, a Bishop Vesey spokesman said: 'The school has co-operated fully with the police. 

'The offences relate to the former teacher's behaviour outside of school and there is no evidence to suggest any child from the school was involved in any way.

'The member of staff was suspended and resigned on 18 July with immediate effect.'

Downes received a two-year jail sentence, suspended for two years, and was ordered to carry out 100 hours of unpaid work in the community.

He was also ordered to attend a sex offenders' work programme for 50 hours and was placed on a two-year supervision order.

Bishop Vesey is one of the oldest schools in the West Midlands, founded in the 16th century. Today it caters for more than 900 pupils and has almost 100 full and part-time members of staff.

Downes, an avid football fan, had joined the school in 2001, having graduated from university in 1998. He had previously been a student at King Edward VI School in Aston.

On his Facebook site, Downes describes himself as single and as 'chilled, different, fun, intense, work that out.'
