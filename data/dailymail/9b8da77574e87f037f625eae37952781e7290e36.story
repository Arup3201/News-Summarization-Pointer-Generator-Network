These two sides will not be able to call each other London rivals for much longer but you suspect the fierce derby atmosphere witnessed here last night may endure for some years to come.

This may have been an unwanted 5pm made-for-television kick-off but the intensity on display — both on and off the field — went some way towards eradicating any Sunday night blues the crowd may have been feeling.

Even as the final whistle drew near, Quins centre George Lowe and his Wasps counterpart Elliot Daly still somehow mustered the energy to scrap fiercely on the ground. The Quins player edged it. Such was the nature of the game.

Despite an energy-sapping battle, George Lowe and Eliot Daly still had the strength for a late scrap

In the end, it was Harlequins who deservedly recorded their second successive European Champions Cup win and they enter the autumn international period top of Pool 2.

Coventry-bound Wasps finished with their second losing bonus point but it was Quins who disappeared into the Wycombe night feeling as confident as they have done at any point this season.

‘I’m delighted with that performance in so many ways,’ said Quins director of rugby Conor O’Shea.

‘People will say when teams are physical against us we can’t play but the game’s about mind-set. If belief was coursing through us I think we’d have taken more of the chances we created but winning in the way we did will make us even stronger mentally.’

The exceptional Matthews, still on 23 years old, is surely an England star of the future

It would appear after a slow start, which insiders put down largely to their willingness to give their England contingent a decent lay-off during the summer, the west London club are stirring.

In man of the match Charlie Matthews, they have a young lock who will surely grace the international stage soon.

Saracens’ 24-year-old George Kruis was one of Stuart Lancaster’s uncapped picks last week but the hulking Matthews — superb in the line out and athletic around the field — cannot be far behind.

Quins are close to signing Wallaby lock James Horwill but, on this evidence, and the evidence of much of the past 12 months, Matthews is a player with a very bright future indeed.

It was a superb solo effort from Simpson, putting Wasps 8-6 ahead after just half an hour, but Quins hit back

‘He’s 23 and he’s had two or three years at the coalface,’ said O’Shea. ‘He’s a big man who will get used to his body and his best is two or three years down the line. He’s just so big and it sometimes takes time.

‘But you can see it coming. He’s a strong player who understands his game is to be physical. And he’s a good lineout forward. It’s nice that young English players are getting an opportunities.’

O’Shea’s men outscored Wasps by two tries to one, while Nick Evans kicked five from seven. Joe Simpson’s superb solo try had seen Wasps take an 8-6 lead on the half-hour.

But Matthews latched on to a sweeping Quins move just before the break to gallop in from 20 metres. He continued to impress after the interval, thanks in part to some vastly improved throwing in from hooker Dave Ward, as the visitors’ pack squeezed Wasps for all they were worth.

Without captain James Haskell, who suffered a nasty viral infection which kept in hospital for much of last week, Wasps’ pack lacked drive and were outmuscled by a Quins eight full of outstanding performers, not least England captain Chris Robshaw.

Wasps director of rugby Dai Young said: ‘We were second best in most areas and I thought we looked a flat, tired team today. Quins were by far the best team. We’ve got no excuses. We came second best and I thought the score flattered us. That was a reality check for us.’

O’Shea was keen to play down concerns over the quad injury which saw prop Joe Marler withdraw from the game after initially being named in the starting XV, while Young also bristled at a question about the newly introduced Head Injury Assessment after Andy Goode and Daly both returned to the field having left it looking noticeably groggy.

‘From my point of view and anybody’s point of view at the club we’d never put any player at risk,’ said Young.

‘We’ll certainly follow any protocol to the letter.’
