Only just into November and the blooper of the season competition may have its unfortunate winner.

On a night when Forest were challenged by owner Fawaz Al Hasawi to prove their nine-match winless run really was just a ‘blip’, the team found themselves two goals down by half-time.

The first was dreadful defending which allowed Arsenal loanee Jon Toral to give a penetrating run from Moses Odubajo the finish it deserved after the Brentford defender and Jamaal Lascelles collided in the area.

Nottingham Forest (4-1-4-1): Darlow 5; Hunt 4 (Lichaj, 32 mins, 4) 5, Wilson 4, Lascelles 4 (Assombalonga, 45 mins, 5), Fox 5; Mancienne 6; Ince 5, Lansbury 6, Osborn 6, Burke 6 (Paterson, 62 mins, 5); Antonio 6

Subs not used: Harding, Fryatt, De Vries, Tesche.

Brentford (4-2-3-1): Button 7; Odubajo 8 (Dallas, 63 mins, 5), Dean 7, Craig 7, Bidwell 7; Douglas 7, Diagouraga 7; Pritchard 7, Toral 7 (Jota, 60 mins, 5), Judge 7; Gray 7 (Proschwitz, 75 mins)

Subs not used: Saunders, Bonham, Smith, Tarkowski.

The second, look away now Eric Lichaj, was a tap-in from Andre Gray courtesy of the weakest, shortest back pass imaginable. The defender had been on the pitch for all of three minutes and the touch could well have been his first.

From such beginnings do crises develop and it is no exaggeration to say that Brentford could have been another two goals to the good in the first 45 minutes. How Jonathan Douglas missed a sitter, only he will know.

A couple of minutes into the second half and Kevin Wilson’s decision to up-end Gray resulted in Alex Pritchard making it three from the penalty spot.

Even then Forest kept battling and Michail Antonio scored from long range near the end after Danny Fox had been taken off on a stretcher leaving the home side with ten men.

What had started as a promising opportunity to put things right was eventually a face-saving exercise.

It would be fair to suggest the Kuwaiti owner is not a patient man. Stuart Pearce is the fifth manager since the Al Hasawi family bought the club two years ago and four of those have been since Fawaz replaced cousin Omar.

The 10-match unbeaten start seems a long time ago now. The owner wrote: ‘I have been in English football long enough now to know one month doesn’t make a season but I have also grown increasingly accustomed to the word “blip”.’

The conclusion to sentences like that in the past has been a quick farewell to the managerial incumbent, however popular the appointment in the first place.

Pearce, never one to shirk a decision, dropped nine-goal, £5.5million striker Britt Assombalonga to the bench. He arrived for the second half as the manager threw everything into a fight back which imploded with the penalty decision.

But it is a leakage rate of 12 goals in five games before Wednesday night which needs addressing urgently.

There was plenty of decent, threatening build-up play from Forest without very much of an end product while every time Brentford broke, panic.

Mark Warburton’s players have not been good travellers, three out of four away defeats before last night although they would have been buoyed by beating high-flying Derby last weekend.

The opening goal was all down to Odubajo’s surging run. Referee Mark Haywood was spared the decision of whether Lascelles’ block was a penalty as both players tumbled to the turf because the ball squirted to Toral, who scored.

Forest responded positively without forcing David Button into any real saves until the latter stages. He could do nothing when Antonio let fly.

But Pearce’s team always looked vulnerable on the break. Interestingly Lascelles was sacrificed in the half-time reshuffle with Michael Mancienne dropping into the back four from midfield.

By that time, Lichaj had tapped the ball into Gray’s path making the task almost impossible. The ex-Aston Villa player hung his head and was roundly booed but showed character to keep battling.

Any hopes of a comeback were dashed with Wilson’s challenge on Gray – a stonewall penalty.

To the fans’ credit, many stayed until the end. To the players’ credit, they kept probing and did score.

But this will go down as a very bad night at the office for Pearce, and, by extension, Al Hasawi.

‘I never fear failure,’ said Pearce. ‘I care about the club and I feel I’m part of the terrace culture. The chairman has been supportive of me and I’m in the infancy of a job here, but, yes, we need a win.

‘Tonight we made individual errors. That erodes the confidence of the team and decent players become nervous players.’

Brentford boss Mark Warburton said: ‘We saw the team sheet and we thought we could exploit the space.’ Exactly.
