Manchester City's two Premier League titles in the past three years have come at an astonishing cost, with the champions paying more per point than any other team.

Since City were bought by Abu Dhabi United Group the club have spent almost £500million on transfer fees alone - and the astronomical figure is even higher when wages are taken into account.

And despite having earned the third most points during the period, City's net spend per point dwarfs their rivals, coming in at a massive £1,096,000, according to a study by Arabian Business.

Manchester City have won two of the last three Premier League titles, but their success has been expensive

Sergio Aguero has been in fine form for City, but he cost the club £38million when he signed in 2011

The likes of Mario Balotelli and Robinho have been expensive flops for City, who have spent big since 2008

The next highest spenders per point are Chelsea, who have won just one title in the past six years despite spending £276m on players, at a cost of £598,000 for every point earned.

Aston Villa and Stoke City are the next least efficient spenders, splashing out around £300,000 for ever point earned since 2008. 

At the other end of the scale Everton are the thriftiest of the 11 sides who have been in the top flight for each of the past six seasons.

Arsenal's net spend was dented by the purchase of Mesut Ozil in 2013 from Real Madrid for £42.5m

Everton have done some great business to turn a transfer profit, including Seamus Coleman for £60,000

Under David Moyes and Roberto Martinez the Toffees have managed to make a net gain of almost £30m, earning £78,000 on player sales for every point won in the league.

However, an efficient pounds per point ratio isn't always enough - Fulham ranked third in the list over the past six years, collecting points at a bargain of £85,200 each, but it couldn't prevent them suffering relegation to the Championship last season.
