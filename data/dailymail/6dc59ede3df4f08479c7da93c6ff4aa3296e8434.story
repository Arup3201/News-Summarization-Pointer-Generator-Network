He was last seen despairing at Holland's exit at the World Cup, but it appears Wesley Sneijder's mood has improved as he enjoyed the Balearic sun with wife Yolanthe Cabau.

The happy couple relaxed by the pool in Ibiza, before frolicking in the water and taking their dog for a walk around the stunning  Island.

Sneijder and his wife, an actress and TV presenter, were spotted enjoying each other's company as the midfielder enjoyed a final rest before the start of the new season.

The Dutchman enjoyed another impressive World Cup as he helped Holland to a third place finish, including a late equaliser against Mexico in the second round.

Four years ago, the ex-Inter Milan man was one of the stars of the World Cup in South Africa.

Although he expressed an interest in joining Louis van Gaal at Manchester United earlier in the summer, Sneijder is still a Galatasaray player, and will be competing for the Turkish club in the Champions League again this season.

The happy couple: Sneijder shared this snap on Twitter and said  '4 Years Anniversary!!! So happy with my wife'

The playmaker married his wife four years ago, and he took to Twitter in April to share his delight at the couple celebrating their fourth anniversary.

The pair’s holiday snaps suggest Sneijder is still as happy as ever with his wife, who has been awarded the ‘Sexiest Dutch Woman’ accolade three times by the Dutch FHM.

Although enjoying a welcome break, Sneijder will have to quickly focus on his football again as Galatasaray are back in action in less than two weeks, when they take on Fenerbahce in the Turkish Super Cup.

His club will be hoping the Dutchman can build on a productive first year-and-a-half in Istanbul, which saw the schemer score 18 goals in 51 appearances.
