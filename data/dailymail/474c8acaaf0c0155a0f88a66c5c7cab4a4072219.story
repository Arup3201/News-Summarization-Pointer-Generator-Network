Fans of the women's surf-wear brand Roxy have expressed their outrage at a new teaser video they feel is demeaning to women, branding it as 'disrespectful' and 'disappointing', and some claiming they feel 'utterly disgusted'.

Posted on the brand's YouTube channel and Facebook page, the short video features a faceless female surfer waking up in the morning and preparing to hit the waves... but the star of the show is her bottom.

Moreover, since the video ends when she paddles out to sea, none of the video actually features any surfing, which fans have found unpalatable.

SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO

Fans of the women's surf-wear brand Roxy have expressed their outrage at a new teaser video they feel is demeaning to women, branding it as 'disrespectful' and 'disappointing'

Fans were angered that the Roxy video sexualised the pro-surfer, and then didn't feature a single shot of surfin

The video, the official teaser ad to 
challenge Roxy fans to unmask the Roxy Pro Biarritz 2013 poster girl 
(who turns out in a later video to be Australian pro-surfer Stephanie 
Gilmore), angered women who felt the surfer was being seen as an sexual 
object rather than a talented athlete.

Facebook
fan Marlaina Read wrote: 'Women are "multi-dimensional" and let us 
demonstrate that by reducing a woman (who is a pro surfer, athlete, 
mentor etc) to her sexual looks.

'She
has so many dimensions we don't even have to show you her face (just 
her bum, ammirite??!) So original, I feel I have learnt so much about 
this woman's "complexity".'

'Sarcasm over now. It's hard enough getting 
coverage for women's sport, and now there is this fantastic opportunity 
to showcase this competition and the ability of the surfers - and it has
been wasted.

'Sitting on your bed in your undies and sexily undressing for a shower is in no way a "dimension".'

Facebook fanWendy McGirr wrote: 'I am not bothered about sexy commercials, sex sells as do attractive bodies. She's a pro surfer that is what their figure looks like. But I am bothered you "promote" a world tour surfing event focusing entirely around a woman's butt.

'Aimed at who?! Not women that's for sure. It shouldn't be focused on a surfer's body or sex at all, it should be about their talent and athleticism and power. Amazed ASP still let sponsors do this in 2013. It wouldn't happen at Wimbledon. Totally uninspiring.'

Marlaina Read wrote: 'It should have got my attention by showing her awesome surfing skill. 
It only got my attention by disappointing me by reducing women, yet 
again, to their sexuality.'

The video shows the faceless girl getting up in the morning and preparing to hit the waves.... but she never actually rides one

Ngai Min Ching said: 'Utterly disgusted that a brand which promotes natural beauty with vast female base clients focus so much on sexualising a female athlete's body when promoting a world surfing event.

'Not a single shot of surfing was displayed on the ad and yet it was meant to promote surfing talents! I was a big Roxy fan until I see the response you have provided.

'We KNOW she is sexy; we know she has an amazing body; but do you have no other selling points to attract interest to Roxy Pro Biarritz? Pathetic really.'

Others tried to defend the brand, claiming male surfers suffer the same fate in the industry - and that at least the video drew attention to the surf competition

Others tried to defend the brand, claiming male surfers suffer the same fate in the industry - and that at least the video drew attention to the surf competition. Molly Misetich said: 'I would just like to point out, that male surfers are shirtless and have their butts showing through their board shorts all the time during contests, and somehow that's not sexist?

'As a very proud surfer girl, I do wish the video had an ounce of surfing in it (come on Roxy) but the video got everyone's attention.

'It may have been for the wrong reasons, but it got attention. With that I bet many more people will be watching the contest than before.

'Everyone messes up. And to say that the company that made the first women's board shorts is sexist and is setting us back, in my opinion, is just stupid.'

The surfer paddles out to sea, but the video ends before she gets to a wave

Roxy were unavailable for direct comment, but wrote on their Facebook page: 'Whether you are athletic, smart, funny, sexy, daring, confident - we support whatever combination you choose to be.

'Women are complex and multidimensional. To ignore this fact is to ignore who we truly are.

'Obviously, there's been much conversation around the video we recently released. We believe all athletes are naturally beautiful, in and out of the water.

'You certainly don't have to be sexy to be an athlete, and we also believe it's not wrong to be an athlete and to be sexy, if you choose to be.

'We don't judge one to be better than the other and we don't believe in excluding one for the other. Thank you for the passionate thoughts shared on the video, and for expressing how much you respect women in surfing.'
