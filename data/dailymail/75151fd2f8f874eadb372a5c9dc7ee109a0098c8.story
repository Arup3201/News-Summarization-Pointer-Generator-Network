Angel di Maria is the most expensive signing in British transfer history after joining Manchester United for £60million from Real Madrid - and he is inked in for another record.

The 26-year-old, who impressed on his United debut at Burnley on Saturday, is set to challenge fellow summer signing Marcos Rojo as the most tattooed player at Old Trafford.

Both Di Maria and Rojo have been training with the Argentina squad ahead of Wednesday’s World Cup final rematch friendly against Germany.

Inked in: Manchester United's record signing has a host of tattoos on his body

Patterns of play: Di Maria, seen training ahead of Argentina's friendly with Germany, shows off his tattoos

Memories: Marcos Rojo has 'For My Family' above his chest and the Copa Libertadores trophy below

Rojo has a couple of tattoos in English, the most visible being 'Pride' on his right leg and 'Glory' on his left leg. 'For My Family' is also above his chest. 

Another is dedicated to former club Estudiantes de la Plata, where he won the Copa Libertadores trophy in 2009.

Di Maria, meanwhile, seems to have a star on one calf and a heart on the other.

Rojo has yet to make an appearance for United since joining them from Sporting Lisbon for £16m last month.

The versatile defender, who can play both as a left-back and as a centre-back, has not yet received his rights to work in the UK.

But that will not be a problem for Rojo when he lines up against Germany in Dusseldorf.

Delayed: Argentina defender Rojo hasn't made his United debut since signing from Sporting Lisbon

On show: 'Pride' is inked on the right leg of Manchester United defender Rojo, with 'Glory' on the other

Good start: Di Maria started for United at Burnley on Saturday and was in fine form before being substituted

Design: Rojo, who played for Argentina at the World Cup, also has tattoo art all over his left and right arms 

Dream: Rojo is delighted to move to Old Trafford but has yet to feature due to work permit problems
