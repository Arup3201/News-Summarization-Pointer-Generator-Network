A respected Georgia policeman, his wife and daughter have been found dead at their family home in a suspected murder-suicide by his stepson, police say.

Paulding County Sheriff's Cpl Sam Driskell, 52, his 36-year-old wife, Muachin Driskell, daughter Carolyn Driskell, 12, and stepson Felix Almonte, 21, were discovered at the house in Hiram about 2pm on Tuesday.

Police say they believe Almonte was the killer and that the victims were shot in their sleep.

He appears to have used his father's service weapon and later turned the gun on himself.

Police believe that Almonte killed the three before shooting himself using his father's service weapon

Scene: The bodies were found after Driskell - a well-respected local cop - did not turn up for work Tuesday

The shootings likely occurred on Monday night.

The bodies were discovered after Cpl Driskell failed to show up for an appointment on Tuesday morning. 

'No rhyme or reason for it,' Paulding County Sheriff Gary Gulledge told WSB-TV2.

'All our guys are heartbroken.

'We've lost one of the best guys we ever had.

'What we initially believe is they have had some issues with the stepson. 

'I don't know how far they go. We're trying to dig into that right now.'

Killed: Driskell, his wife, daughter and stepson had all been shot to death in an apparent murder-suicide, the Paulding County Sheriff's Office said. Investigators believe Driskell's stepson, 21-year-old Felix Almonte, used his stepfather's county-issued Glock .45 to kill his family and then himself

Shocked: Derek Morris, cousin of Sam Driskell, said they were a regular family

Investigation: Cpl. Sam Driskell was found fatally shot along with his wife, daughter and stepson

Derrek Morris, Driskell's cousin who lives across the street, said he had no reason to believe anything had been going on with Almonte. 

'He was just a good young man,' he said.

'I never seen anything out of the ordinary with him.'

Cpl Driskell worked in the Crimes Against Children unit and oversaw the local sex offender registry.

He had served in the force for over 10 years, according to Sky News.

In September he received a public safety award for exemplary service.
