The websites of leading retailers crashed today as five times the average number of shoppers flocked to their computers to snap up Black Friday deals online. 

Tesco,  Argos, and Curry's all had problems with their websites this morning with thousands of internet users rushing to buy cut-priced goods.

More than 40,000 people were shopping when discounted televisions, gadgets and clothing became available at midnight, with scores more expected to inundate websites at lunchtime.

Tesco Direct was still unavailable this afternoon as hundreds of thousands of people tried to place orders

Later the company updated its website's background, though it was still inaccessible to shoppers

Online transactions were expected to rise by 22 per cent compared to last year, with 8.5million items being bought virtually.

Visa Europe forecasts that £360,000 will be spent every minute today online and in shops, but that December 1 holds even more promise for online retailers. 

More than £500million is expected to be spent on the day known as Cyber Monday, contributing to an overall forecast of more than £1billion for British businesses over the weekend, according to the credit card company. 

Less conservatively, the Centre for Retail Research predicted online sales of £556million today, making a total of £1.6billion once added to store sales. 

The organisation projected that £2million-a-minute would be spent.  

Several retail websites buckled under the pressure of increased traffic. 

Among them was Argos whose website crashed as as 17,000 people visited the site every minute between 8 and 9am.

'To ensure customers get the best possible experience, we've had to limit the number of visitors entering at any one time, so some customers may experience a delay,' a spokesman said.

'We're really sorry about this and we are reminding customers that they can still buy at any of our 700+ stores nationwide.' 

Asda was temporarily unavailable while Tesco Direct has not been able to process orders since early this morning. 

Topshop, who is offering 50 per cent off selected items, crashed this afternoon while Best Buy has not been operating well all day.

Argos also suffered technical difficulties this morning after being inundated with hits but is now working 

Curry's was still experiencing issues this afternoon and was issuing queue numbers for online shoppers 

More than double the number of online transactions were carried out by 10am today than on Black Friday last year according to Postcode Anywhere

Curry's was dolling out queue numbers for online customers. At 2pm the estimated waiting time to browse stock was 25 minutes. 

Vast numbers of consumers were shopping from tablets and mobile phones instead of computers. 

More than 70 per cent of PC World's customers used handheld devices.   

Jeremy Fennell, e-Commerce Director at Currys PC World, said: 'We've seen astonishing demand online and implemented a pre-planned queuing system to most fairly support shoppers.

'We are continuing to implement our queuing system while shoppers take advantage of our great deals online and in-store. 

'Across the country we've seen customers ready to shop with queues outside a number of stores, but everything has been very well organised and in good spirits, with no reported incidents.

'This has been our biggest Black Friday ever with web traffic up five-fold and transactions peaking at eight per second from stores and online combined.'

According to experts, Black Friday has seen its busiest year in history in Britain. 

Creeping up on the British consumer last year following historic success in America, few retailers took part in deals last year. 

More have joined in however, and the increase in profit will be 'exponential' for the economy, experts said. 

Patrick O'Brien, retail analyst at Verdict Retail, said: 'Some of the offers are in-store only, some are online only and there are sizable discounts on them. 

'It's way bigger than last year. We don't yet have numbers but there are more than double the number retailers on board, it's exponentially larger.' 

Cyber Monday is expected to see even more spending. 

'Mega Monday, which used to be the biggest online shopping day, will reach its own new high this year, surpassing £500m,' said Kevin Jenkins, Managing Director UK & Ireland at Visa Europe. 

'Altogether we're looking at a £1.7bn Cyber Weekend,' he added

At 10am, more than 40,000 people were shopping online in Britain.

Online sales at midnight were 130% higher than Black Friday last year, and three times the number than 12am on Thursday according to figures obtained by Postcode Anywhere.

While around 3,300 transactions are normally processed at this time, more than 9,000 were carried out last night.

At 1am, sales were increased by almost 500% between 9,000 online retailers including Tesco, Boots, Reiss and various UK department stores.

Online traffic collated by Postcode Anywhere also suggested that figures would grow higher at lunchtime.

'Our data shows that as the clock struck midnight, more spenders than ever hit the online sales to bag the best bargains,' said Guy Mucklow, CEO and Co-Founder of the company.

'Our real-time spending tracker shows that the UK's most dedicated shoppers are based in our cities, especially Birmingham, Belfast and Glasgow where the highest number of orders were placed online between midnight and 8am.

'With online shopping traffic set to continue to rise, we are urging retailers to ensure they are making the most of their own data to better serve the needs of their customers.'

Most online shopping was being done in Birmingham, Belfast, Glasgow, Manchester and Newcastle this morning, with most internet users buying televisions, computers and phones. 

Amazon has not revealed yet revealed any figures for this year's sales, though more than 4million transactions were carried out online on Black Friday 2013. 

While many websites struggled to cope with the demand of increased traffic, stores were also inundated with impatient crowds desperate to get their hands on a bargain. 

Kate O’Brien Marketing Director, Daisy Group Plc, advised retailers to be prepared for sudden spikes in online traffic and overwhelming numbers of shoppers.  

'Retailers participating in the new ‘Black Friday’ trend are understandably experiencing high volumes of traffic to their websites, some have seen their website traffic increase by a few hundred percent.

'To avoid their websites slowing down at a business-critical time, businesses must ensure they have the right IT infrastructure in place to deal with any spikes in demand they may experience.

'One of the most obvious ways for them to do that is to make a greater use of the cloud. When retailers need additional resources, they can scale the service up or down immediately at the click of a button, ensuring business continues as normal.' 

Online electrical goods retailer ao.com said today is likely to be its busiest ever, with sales up to five times higher than last year's Black Friday. 

Shortly after 3.45pm today, an estimated £340,000,000 had been spent according to search and digital agency Branded3.
