The world's fastest man Usain Bolt has split from blonde fashion designer girlfriend to concentrate on winning Olympic gold at London 2012, it was claimed today.

The Jamaican sprint star has dumped Slovakian-born Lubica Slovak after six months so she won't 'distract' the 25-year-old from his Olympic training, it was reported.

Bolt's split from Slovak, 28, with whom he was said to have a 'very serious' relationship, comes just days after a race row erupted in his native Jamaica over his choice of a white girlfriend.

The split was revealed on Jamaican news website The Jamaica Star, days after sources close to the couple had insisted they were 'very much in love'.

A source close to the Jamaican last night described the split as a 'mutual decision between two adults'.

Bolt's agent today confirmed to MailOnline that the Jamaican sprinter is 'single', but would not provide further comment.

Track star Bolt Bolt has come in for criticism from fellow black Jamaicans unhappy that he has chosen a white partner.

One online posting said: ‘Really now Usain! Some successful black men obviously suffer from a white woman complex. You too?’, while another complained: ‘Another one of our men snatched.’

Further protests included: ‘Out of all the girls on this island you pick a snowbunny’, and: ‘These superstars will always disappoint if we depend on them to raise our racial identity.’

The sprinter nicknamed Lightning Bolt is known for his mid-race celebrations and post- victory bow-and-arrow pose.

He is the reigning Olympic champion and world record holder over 100 and 200 metres.

He hopes to smash his own records and retain his titles in London this summer, watched by his Slovakian-born girlfriend.

Miss Slovak emigrated to Canada with her father when she was 14 and studied fashion design at the Ryerson University in Toronto.

She moved to Jamaica after she ‘fell in love’ with the island during a holiday in 2000.

Miss Slovak was introduced to Bolt last year through a mutual friend, reggae singer Tami Chynn, with whom she owns an award-winning clothing line called Anuna and a Kingston boutique.

Shortly after they met, she interviewed Bolt for a feature in a Slovakian newspaper and they began dating in mid-November.
