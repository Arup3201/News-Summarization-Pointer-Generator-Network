As if UKIP leader Nigel Farage hasn't enough on his plate, a BBC glitch saw him appear on screen with a Hitler-style moustache today.

Only yesterday, Farage was accused of making racist and fascist remarks during his time at school, with the party leader admitting he did 'push the boundaries of debate' further than he should.

And now a pixel fault on the BBC big screen in Media City, Salford, saw the UKIP leader sporting a somewhat unfortunate accessory when appearing on BBC Breakfast this morning.

Not a good luck: The timing of the glitch which appeared on BBC Breakfast couldn't have been worse for Farage

Channel Four News broadcast comments from teachers at Dulwich College that the teenage Farage was a ‘fascist’ and a ‘racist’ when a pupil at the private London school in the late 1970s and early 1980s.

A letter from 1981 claims Mr Farage, now 49, was even heard ‘shouting Hitler Youth songs’. The claims did not prevent him being appointed as a prefect at the school.

The Ukip leader last night played down the significance of the claims, which he said were made by left-wing teachers who disliked his views. He denied singing Nazi songs.

Sadly this latest, unfortunate error comes just at the wrong time for the embattled Farage.

And today marked a new low for Farage on a personal level when he was forced to call for the sacking of friend and fellow party member Godfrey Bloom.

The MEP, speaking at an event held to promote women, was heard to say 'This place is full of sluts,' before calling one journalist 'a sad little man' and hitting another with a brochure.

It comes barely a month after Mr Bloom's complaint that UK aid money was being sent to ‘Bongo Bongo Land’.

Mr Bloom was attending an event at the UKIP conference designed to promote women in politics.

He
seemed an unlikely choice, having previously declared that he wanted to
deal with women's issues because: 'I just don't think they clean behind
the fridge enough.'

Several female speakers made 
reference to the remark at today’s meeting, with one confessing: ‘I too 
have never cleaned behind the fridge.’

Mr Bloom replied: ‘This place is full of sluts.’

UKIP called 
an emergency meeting tonight to discuss whether to kick Mr Bloom out of 
the party. The leader does not have the power to withdraw the whip, but chairman Mr Steve Crowther said the remarks had gone too far.

And there are further stormy waters ahead for Farage, after another UKIP MEP said he believed rape has 'different levels of culpability'

Roger Helmer said he stood by his view that the victim 'shares a part of the responsibility' in some date rape cases.

Mr Helmer, who was appearing on Channel 4 News to respond to the Ukip whip being withdrawn from his fellow MEP Godfrey Bloom for calling females in the audience at a conference fringe event 'sluts', insisted 'we in this party respect women'.

Questioned about his views on rape, Mr Helmer said: 'I think what we are looking at is the situation where different crimes have different levels of culpability, that's why we have judges, that's why judges apply different sentences for different offences.

'We in this party respect women, I'm sorry that we don't live up, or that Godfrey didn't live up to that today.'

Asked if he stood by past comments on rape he said: 'Yes I do.'

Mr Helmer added: 'I said that there were different degrees of culpability and that is why we have judges who issue different sentences. You would expect a judge trying a murder case to apply the appropriate sentence in relation to the culpability of the person who is accused.

'We are here today at a party conference where we have a whole range of issues and I'm not interested in doing an interview with you over a lot of old ground from way back, I'm much more interested in talking about policy.'

Foot in mouth: UKIP's Roger Helmer's quotes on the levels of rape are sure to cause his leader more trouble

In 2011, while a Tory MEP, Mr Helmer described a 'classic stranger rape' scenario, where a 'masked individual emerges from the bushes, hits his victim over the head with a blunt instrument, drags her into the undergrowth and rapes her, and then leaves her unconscious, careless whether she lives or dies'.

He contrasted that with a 'date rape', where a woman 'voluntarily goes to her boyfriend's apartment, voluntarily goes into the bedroom, voluntarily undresses and gets into bed, perhaps anticipating sex, or naively expecting merely a cuddle.

'But at the last minute she gets cold feet and says 'Stop!'. The young man, in the heat of the moment, is unable to restrain himself and carries on,' he added.'In both cases an offence has been committed, and the perpetrators deserve to be convicted and punished.

'But whereas in the first case, I'd again be quite happy to hang the guy, I think that most right-thinking people would expect a much lighter sentence in the second case. Rape is always wrong, but not always equally culpable.'

Mr Helmer added: 'While in the first case, the blame is squarely on the perpetrator and does not attach to the victim, in the second case the victim surely shares a part of the responsibility, if only for establishing reasonable expectations in her boyfriend's mind.'

Mr Helmer defected from the Tories to Ukip in March 2012, claiming Nigel Farage's party better reflected the views of Conservative voters.
