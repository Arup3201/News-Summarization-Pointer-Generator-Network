Tucked behind picture frames, inside bedside bibles and on top of toilet cisterns - one traveller is letting hoteliers know exactly what he thinks of their establishments.

Self professed 'comedian and hotel graffiti artist'  David Bussell has spent seven years leaving his mark on rooms on his travels across the country and world.

It is not clear whether his 'art' is considered cheeky graffiti, or irresponsible vandalism, but the 37-year-old Londoner insists he has never had a complaint from the establishment ownersÂ  - perhaps because they don't know it is there.

The work of 'hotel graffiti' enthusiast David Bussell, who has left his 'amusing' mark on hotel rooms on travels over the past 7 years

The comedy writer and performer's hidden work have been secreted behind paintings and wall hangings in places ranging from Tenby in Wales to Guatamala City

The artist scrawls cheeky, head-scratching and provocative notes on the back of wardrobes, paintings, and mirrors

The comedian said: 'Boredom is my big motivator. I tend to just write whatever seems funny in the moment'

The messages are often so well hidden that they may never be seen by hotel users

The comedy writer and performer's hidden work have been concealed in places ranging from Tenby in Wales to Guatamala City.

His work also crops up in locations including London, Northern Ireland, Oxford, Edinburgh, Canterbury, Brighton, Manchester, Cuba, Berlin, and 'all over British Columbia and the United States'.

Notes include 'Please No Baptising' above a sink, 'Mirror Broken, Please See Estimated Face' and 'This Hotel Wasn't Half Bad, It Was All The Way Bad'.

While some may find his humour slightly tasteless, Mr Bussell, from Stoke Newington, London, says the inspiration for his unusual hobby came from a mix of childhood memories and boredom while travelling

However, he seems to be aware that his brand of toilet humour might not amuse everyone

The 37-year-old said he has left messages in every hotel he has stayed in since 2006

Mr Bussell, from Stoke Newington, London, says the inspiration for his unusual hobby came from a mix of childhood memories and boredom while travelling.The 37-year-old explains: 'I have left messages in just about every hotel I've stayed in since 2006.

'I've never had a hotel complain. I never leave something on show that won't rub right off, and the stuff that's hidden just stays that way, I guess.

But the comedian said the only down side to leaving his gags concealed around the world, is that he never gets to witness the payoff

Mr Bussell said he was inspired by a holiday in Paris when he stayed in a backpacker hostel and found travellers had been using the flipside of a tacky painting as a 'secret bulletin board'

'I got the idea from a holiday in Paris back in the nineties when I stayed in a backpacker hostel and found travellers had been using the flipside of a tacky painting as a kind of secret bulletin board.

'When I was a kid I remember my parents redecorated their house and let me draw doodles on the plaster before they put up fresh paper.

'I was fascinated by the idea of the next tenant stripping it off one day and seeing the pictures I'd left them. Similarly I love the idea of people discovering the messages I write in hotel rooms and wondering about the person who left them.

His favourite part of the process, he said, is idea of people discovering the messages he writes in hotel rooms and wondering about the person who left them

'Boredom is my big motivator.

'I tend to just write whatever seems funny in the moment but certain objects have been known to inspire ideas; bathroom fittings, kitchen appliances, Gideon's bibles.

'Mostly I just write in places that will only be searched out by the extremely curious though - guests rather than cleaners I suspect given that some of the rooms I've stayed in obviously hadn't had a vacuum cleaner run under their beds in years.

He believes that much of his work may remain hidden because some hotels rarely look behind the mirrors and wall hangings

He said: 'I suspect given that some of the rooms I've stayed in obviously hadn't had a vacuum cleaner run under their beds in years'

'The sad part of the process, particularly for a comedian who's used to getting immediate gratification from a joke in the form of audience laughter, is that I never get to witness the payoff.

'Nothing would make me happier than someone sending me a photo of one of my pieces they found by accident, unless it's the hotel management that is, in which case I'd better hope I paid by cash and didn't leave them a deposit on my credit card.'
