A self-confessed murderer lashed out in the courtroom Monday after he was handed a 50-to-100 year prison sentence for slaying his girlfriend, a mother-of-five, and dumping her body in the garbage.

Before learning his fate, Jahleel Hoskins, of Grand Rapids, Michigan, offered a weeping apology to the family of Latrice Maze, whom he killed last March, insisting he loved the woman and didn't meant to take her life.

But when Kent County Circuit Court Judge James Redford sentenced him to up to a century behind bars, the handcuffed man snapped, throwing the podium toward the bench and lunging forward before security dragged him from the courtroom.

But before he even left the premises, Hoskins' family began screaming at the family of the victim, including her mother and father, according to mlive.com.

The two families surging towards each other, yelling, and additional court deputies had to tear them apart.

Hoskins' devastated mother, who made an emotional statement to the court earlier, yelled at Hoskins cousin to shut up as Redford banged his gavel and demanded order.

In almost as dramatic a move, the 26-year-old halted his trial on December 11 - the third day - by pleading guilty to second-degree murder in the middle of testimony.

Victim: Latrice Maze, pictured left and right, was murdered by Hoskins last March

But Assistant Kent County Prosecutor Kellee Koncki urged the judge not to give the killer a lesser sentence because he confessed. Rather, she asked Redford to sentence him to what would result in a lifetime in prison.

Maze went missing on March 19. Less than two months later, Grand Rapids police said they believed her body had been incinerated and dumped in a landfill after Hoskins put it in a Dumpster.

According to mlive.com, Koncki argued that Hoskins' motive in the slaying was that he wanted to stop her talking to police after he allegedly assaulted the father of two of her children.

She said the violent strangulation was premeditated.

Lies: He insisted he loved the woman and didn't meant to take her life

Redford also admonished Hoskins for dumping the body, robbing the family of a chance to have a proper funeral for their loved one.

Maze' mother, Wanda Rose, spoke before Hoskins was sentenced and recalled the difficult task of trying to explain to her grandchildren about their mother's death.

Hoskins said in his piece that he loved Maze and worked hard to support her and her daughter.

'Before this happened, everybody looked at me as a good person,' Hoskins said. 'In the blink of an eye, I'm a monster.'
