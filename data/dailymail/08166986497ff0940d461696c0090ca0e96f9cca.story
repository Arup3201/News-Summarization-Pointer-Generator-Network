Nero the dog is not only man’s best friend – he is his best travel companion as well.

Adventurous Joshua Sivarajah, 34, took his pet dog along for the ride as he cycled around Britain on a bike that was modified to include a seat for his four-legged travel mate.

The four-month adventure saw the pair explore the most beautiful places in the country – from Cornwall to the Outer Hebrides in Scotland.

The original plan called for Nero to run alongside his master but the dog injured his paws on the very first day of their journey.

Instead of leaving his pet behind, Joshua found a welder who added a shelf to the back of the bike for Nero to sit on.

Joshua said he gave up everything to go on the adventure and he couldn’t think of anyone better to bring along for the epic ride.

He said: ‘I grew up reading books like CS Lewis and Tolkien. I wanted an adventure of my own. I gave up my job, my house and my possessions.

‘All I have to my name is Nero, a tent, cooking stove, some clothes and some trainers.

‘Nero is my best friend. When I went to see the litter he was the only puppy that ignored me. I was determined at that point to make him love me.

‘He is my best friend and with me all day, every day. Nero is my dog, friend, companion and soul mate. This has been one great adventure.’

Joshua, who used to run his own sales company, decide to pack his bags and leave his life in Southampton behind in July.

The pair travelled 2,500 miles in four months, covering the length and breadth of the UK, including Cornwall, Bristol and the Pembrokeshire coast.

They also made it to Ireland, thanks to the help of a fisherman, before exploring the Outer Hebrides in Scotland.

But the trip took an unexpected twist early on when Nero burned his paws on the hot ground amid hot weather on the first day of their adventure.

Joshua then took the decision to make alterations to the bike to enable Nero, who he has had since he was eight weeks old, to continue the mammoth trip. He said: ‘We met an ironmonger in Whitby who saw Nero on the bike.

‘When I explained what we were doing, he made and welded a shelf to the back of the bike for Nero to sit in.

Joshua Sivarajah says Nero attracted a lot of attention as they met strangers who invited them into their homes for an overnight stay or meal

‘He’s not strapped in, for him it’s like being a passenger on a motorbike. He’s only fallen off once, and that was when he went to sleep.’

Joshua and his four-legged friend ‘free camped’ out most nights, setting up their tent in parks, on farmland and by rivers.

Their journey so far, including his food costs, have been funded via a Go Fund account - with money coming from people who heard of his story online about his travels.

He has also secured sponsorship for his phone and gadgets, so he can post updates on a series of blogs.

He said: ‘I have been amazed by people’s kindness. Many people have invited me into their homes to stay or for a meal.

‘Having Nero with me is a great conversation starter and the people we meet always want to find out more about him and what we are doing.

‘Nero and I, have many more wonderful and exciting adventures planned. Next on the list is Europe.’
