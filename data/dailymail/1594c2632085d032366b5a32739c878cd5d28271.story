A family's pet rabbits had their necks broken by thugs who kicked their way into the animals' cages and left their bloodied bodies strewn across their owner's garden.

The rabbits, which belonged to schoolchildren Lauren and Shay Green, were discovered 'bent in half' with visible footprints marking their white fur after the pets were snatched from their locked cages during the frenzied attack.

Mother Michelle Grogan said she was physically sick when she saw the remains of her children's beloved pets, Rosie and Raggles, lying on their garden lawn in Shipley, West Yorkshire.

Distraught: Michelle Brogan of Shipley, West Yorkshire, pictured with her children Nathan, 15, Lauren, 12, and Shay, 6, discovered the family's rabbits had been killed by vicious thugs

Their teeth had been knocked out in the force of the attack, and their necks snapped.

'I got up and as always went to check on the rabbits first,' said Ms Grogan,37.

'It was a horrific sight because they had been kicked around and stood on.

'They had been sleeping in a locked cage, which had been smashed to pieces. 

'It's heartbreaking, and so unnecessary. My children were crying for days.'

Victims: Black and white rabbit Rosie and brown and white Raggles were stamped on, kicked, and had their teeth knocked out in the bloddy attack

Killed: Ms Grogan said she was physically sick when she found the bloody bodies of Rosie and Raggles

After breaking the news to Lauren, 12, and six-year-old Shay, Ms Grogan, who is also mother to 15-year-old Nathan, discovered two of her neighbours had also been targeted.

Lisa Kendall and Kimberley Clapham, who live on the same street, also woke to find their rabbits had been killed during the night. Ms Grogan immediately went to next-door neighbour Miss Kendall's home, after she found the body of her daughter Ellie's pet rabbit, Peanut.

Snatched: The rabbits were taken from their locked cage during the frenzied attack

Miss Kendall, a mother-of-three, said she barely recognised the animal, who the family had been looking after for around nine months. 

The pair then went to check on Miss Clapham, 22, who had found her four-year-old son's rabbit, Fluffy, lifeless on the ground. 

The vandals had also smashed their way into the neighbours' hutches, removing the floor of one and kicking their way into two more, leaving wire mesh ripped out of shape and hanging from the door.

Target: Neighbour Ellie Kendall's rabbit Peanut was also found dead

Full-time mother Ms Grogran added: 'I haven't slept since. It's just mindless violence. 

'They weren't interested in trying to get in the house and they didn't take anything from the shed like the lawnmower. 

'They targeted the rabbits, and wanted to make them suffer. It's so upsetting. 

'The rabbits couldn't have fought back, it was just torture.'

A West Yorkshire police spokesman said the force was aware of the rabbit deaths and was 'keeping an open mind' about the incident.
