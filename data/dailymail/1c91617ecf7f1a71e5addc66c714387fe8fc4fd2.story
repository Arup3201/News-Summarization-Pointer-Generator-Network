Back on track: The mother of Misty Nunley, pictured, said her 33-year-old daughter was putting her life back together

The mother of one of the four women murdered in an apartment in Tulsa, Oklahoma, said her daughter was working to get her life back on track when she was killed.

Misty Nunley's mother, Cheryl Nunley, said her 33-year-old daughter had befriended Rebeika Powell, one of the victims, and had been staying with her on and off in the crime-ridden apartment building for the past week.

She said she called her daughter nearly every morning to check in, and spoke to her Monday just hours before the women were found dead.

'She had positive people back in her 
life,' Cheryl Nunley told The Associated Press, holding back tears while
sitting with family and friends in a tiny apartment a few blocks away 
from the crime scene.

'She's not perfect. She ran around 
with some people she shouldn't have been running around with, but she 
was getting her life back together.'

Misty Nunley was found murdered on Monday, along with Powell and Kayetie Melchor, 23 - twin sister who were both mothers of young children - and Julie Jackson, 55.

Also in the apartment was a 3-year-old boy who is believed to have witnessed the entire shooting. He was unharmed.

Detectives and officers were 'beating the bushes' to figure out what happened, police spokesman Leland Ashley said Monday.

He
added: 'Right now, we have no clear-cut suspect. I don't want to strike
fear in the community tonight, but we do have an individual or 
individuals who murdered four people. Do we know if there was a motive, 
like a jealous lover? We don't know that. We can't say if it was random 
or if someone knew [the victims].'

Relatives and neighbors have told Nunley's family there may have been a romantic spat between one of the women who lived at the apartment and a boyfriend or ex-boyfriend. Police wouldn't comment on those rumors.

Murdered: The bodies of Rebeika Powell, left, and twin sister Kayetie Melchor, were found in the apartment building with two others

Mystery: Police have not yet determined a suspect or a motive in the killings, which occurred in a crime-ridden area of Tulsa

Mothers: Both of the twins had young children when their lives were tragically cut short on Monday

In an interview with CBS News, Rebeika and Kayetie's grief-stricken father, Larry Powell cried out: 'My life's gone. My kids are gone.'

According to reports, police and EMS 
workers were called to the apartment near 61st Street and Peoria Avenue 
at 12:36 p.m. after an unidentified person stumbled across the corpses.

At the run-down apartment complex, 
bed sheets or cardboard hang as improvised draperies in many windows 
behind a black wrought-iron gate.

The
guard shack is empty and signs read 'Curfew 10 p.m. for everyone, 
everyday' and 'Photo ID required to be on property.' Three of the units 
are burned out and boarded up with plywood.

Riverwood
has long been plagued by crime, and Tulsa police say there were two 
murders in the Fairmont Terrace Apartments in 2012.

Residents say gunfire and break-ins are part of the pattern of their everyday lives.

'We're in the eye of the storm,' says Charles Burke, a 48-year-old construction worker. 'You're on your toes. You can't be too careful.'

Neighbor Jamie Kramer, a 28-year-old mother of two young children, has lived at the apartment complex for 10 years.

She said the crime seems to come in cycles and that things had been pretty quiet for several months until Monday.

'It escalates and goes back down, it escalates and it goes back down,' she says. 'Usually, it's bad when it gets hot.'

Mystery: Officers have canvassed the area for witnesses but have yet to determine a motive or lead

Neighbor Ladawn Mack, a 25-year-old cashier, says she's used to seeing police cars in the street, and that Monday's quadruple homicide is enough to make her take extra precautions.

'We have a house alarm and I've always had a gun for my home,' Mack said.

Resident Alexis Draite, 20, recently moved to Tulsa from Oklahoma City, believing it to be safer.

Her strategy for staying alive: 'Lock the doors, lock the cars and don't stay outside longer than you need to.'

'The victims were shot multiple times,' Tulsa Police Officer Jillian Roberson toldÂ NBC News.

Police immediately began canvassing the area trying to find any witnesses to the crime, aside from the child who is believed to have been in the residence when the shooting occurred.

Anyone with information on the case can contact Crime Stoppers at 918-596-COPS.
