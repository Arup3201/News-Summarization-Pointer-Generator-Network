She released her latest album by uploading tracks and videos straight to iTunes, claiming she wants to speak ‘directly to her fans with no filter’.

And it seems that Beyonce has got her wish.

Within hours, hundreds of fans slammed the star’s record for its X-rated lyrics and ‘pornographic’ videos in which she twerks and dresses scantily.

Beyonce faced a backlash on social networking sites over 'vile' lyrics and 'pornographic' videos on her new album released on Friday, to the surprise of fans

On social networking sites, the 32-year-old singer was called ‘vile’ and ‘disgusting’ for the provocative tracks, including songs titled Blow and Drunk in Love.

Some users questioned whether she was a fit role model to millions of young fans.

The star, who rose to fame in girl band Destiny’s Child, has often campaigned for women’s rights.

But fans said she should now be ashamed of herself for  following in the footsteps of Rihanna and Miley Cyrus, who have shocked viewers with their erotic music videos.

And they accused her of ‘cashing in’ on her one-year-old daughter, Blue Ivy, who features in one of the clips.

Campaigners and parents yesterday called for video sharing site YouTube, where the 17 videos can be seen, and iTunes, where the self-titled album of 14 songs costs £12.99, to ban the explicit content.

Within hours of the stealth release of the star's fifth album, entitled Beyonce, people shared their disgust at songs including those titled Blow and Drunk in Love

Beyonce also came under fire with critics claiming she was 'cashing in' on her daughter Blue Ivy, who appears in the video to accompany the track Blue

Vivienne Pattison, of pressure group Mediawatch-UK, said last night: ‘This is such a shame to see because Beyonce didn’t get to where she is by jumping on the same bandwagon as Rihanna and people like that who we expect to be explicit and controversial.

‘She was the one we always thought we could count on to set a good example and keep producing music with powerful messages that empowered women and girls.

‘And I would have thought that a star of her magnitude wouldn’t need to do something like this.

‘She has sold out and it’s really sad. Like it or not Beyonce is a role model and she needs to take responsibility for that. Especially as a mother herself, it’s very surprising that she would do this.

She added: ‘This is now on YouTube and children can see it.

‘It’s not like parents can protect their children by not buying the album. It’s there, on the internet, for anyone to access and as a parent that is incredibly worrying.’

Among the most shocking of the videos is Partition, in which Beyonce cage dances for her husband, 44-year-old rapper Jay-Z, before writhing around on the floor in her underwear.

She sings about a rough sexual encounter taking place in the back seat of a car and refers to the Monica Lewinsky scandal.

Vivienne Pattison, of pressure group Mediawatch-UK, said: 'This is such a shame to see because Beyonce didn't get to where she is by jumping on the same bandwagon as Rhianna and people like that who we expect to be explicit and controversial'

In another song, called Blow, she describes being in a state of heightened sexual arousal.

In the accompanying video she is joined by a troupe of nearly naked female dancers.

One woman wears only a pair of knickers and stars on her breasts while others simulate lap dances with male performers.

Concern was also raised over Blue, a tribute to Beyonce’s daughter Blue Ivy. In it the one-year-old is seen walking beside her mother.

Pippa Smith of Safermedia said she was shocked at the ‘irrational’ decision to ‘expose’ the child to the eyes of strangers on the internet.

She said: ‘To have her own daughter is a bit beyond the pale, no one in their right mind would do that. She’s far too young and Beyonce is exposing her to the views of all sorts of strangers which isn’t safe online, what with all the worry about online predators.

‘It’s a very, very stupid thing to do and not rational at all.

‘My view would be that the whole album should be banned. Even with age ratings it would still circulate round the playground and it’s sheer exploitation.’

Beyonce released 30-second clips of the 17 new music videos without warning on Friday

In other videos on the album, released on Thursday night, Beyonce wears skimpy outfits as she performs among semi-naked dancers, some with whips.

She also becomes the latest singer to engage in ‘twerking’ – a raunchy hip thrusting dance move that came to public notice when former Disney child star Miley Cyrus performed it this summer.

Beyonce repeatedly refers to sex and alcohol and makes frequent use of the word ‘b*****s’.

Yesterday, one Twitter user wrote: ‘Jeez! Beyonce has left me flabbergasted. Like I never expected her to be this explicit.’

Another said: ‘The fact Blue Ivy has parts on Beyonce’s new album might be the most disgusting thing I’ve ever heard. Way to exploit your baby for money.’ A third added: ‘Shame on you Beyonce.’

Earlier this year Beyonce was criticised for performing at a Chime for Change concert, which raised money to support women’s rights, in a tight leather bodice.

But her dramatic image shift began in February when she sang at the US Superbowl in a tight black leotard and fishnet tights.

Mrs Smith said: ‘It just doesn’t seem right. You get these beautiful young singers with amazing voices who start out squeaky clean and get a makeover and become vamps. And it is such a shame.’
