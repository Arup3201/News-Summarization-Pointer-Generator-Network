Adoption activist, actress and arts advocate Deborra-Lee Furness has been named the New South Wales Australian of the Year for her fight for children's rights around the world.

In 2008, Ms Furness, the mother of two adopted children with husband Hugh Jackman, launched National Adoption Awareness Week in an attempt to pursue her vision for 'children all over the world to be given every chance to live a fulfilled life and achieve their full potential'.

As an ambassador for World Vision, Ms Furness campaigns for orphans in Asia and Africa and  insisted for Prime Minister Tony Abbott to make it easier for Australians to adopt locally and overseas.

Ms Furness spends her time lobbying for children's rights and in 2013 she publicly slammed Australia's 'anti-adoption culture', insisting that extreme adoption measures deter couples who are interested.

'Hugh and I did attempt to do it here and I went to the first meeting and realised that this was just not going to happen,' Ms Furness told the ABC.

'It was not supportive, it was not informative, it was not pro-active.'

The lack of support that came from Australia's adoption process prompted Ms Furness and her husband to begin looking at options overseas.

'We need to look at creating relationships with inter-country adoption with sending countries like Cambodia,' Ms Furness said.

'Post-adoption support [is needed] to educate parents what it is to parent a child that may have come from a war zone or from abuse.

'You have to have the tools to know how to parent a fragile child and you need to have a support system for the children that are going through this.' 

Australia has on of the lowest rates of adoption in the world, with around a 77 per cent decline in the number of adoptions over the past 25 years, according to the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare. 

It has also been reported that in the 2013-14 financial year only 339 children were adopted in Australia; 129 from overseas and 210 locally. 

Ms Furness and her husband also set up the Jackman Furness Foundation for the Performing Arts, in an attempt to support art students. 

Other NSW Australian of the Year finalists were Antarctic station leader Narelle Campbell, humanitarian aid worker Andrew Harper and medical researcher Professor Brendan Smith.  

Jeremy Lasek, chief executive of National Australia Day, said 'the NSW finalists are Australians who are we are truly proud of, and thankful to, for their tireless work they do to make the lives of others better', Sydney Morning Herald reported. 

On January 25, the NSW award winners will go to Canberra for the national awards.
