Balancing on thin canvas lines tied over canyons up to 450 feet deep, these pictures from America capture the hair-raising sport of highlining.

Photographer Cameron Gardner, 24, followed the daredevil athletes to Moab, in Utah and Yosemite, in California to capture these amazing shots of their breathtaking stunts.

His pictures show Canadian Julien Desforges and Ray Diaz edging along their slacklines - thin strips of canvas held in place by a winch - taking up to ten minutes to cross from one side to the other.

Balancing act: The pictures were taken as Cameron's friends walked above canyons in Moab, Utah, and Yosemite National Park in California

Focus: Cameron compares highlining to meditation, saying it is less about physical ability and more about relaxing and enjoying the experience

Cameron said: 'Walking across a rope so high feels different for everyone it's a balance of fear and joy. Once you are able to calm down and settle in it's a really meditative experience.

'Highlining is definitely not about getting all pumped up on energy and adrenaline. It's about everything all coming together at once and enjoying being in that moment with the natural world.

'Really, highlining is a lot like life: you take it one step at a time until you overcome the obstacle you are facing and are back on solid ground again.'

Despite the death-defying appearance of 
these pictures, all the highliners are actually tied on to their lines by safety 
ropes, which are double knotted and ensure that any fall only lasts for a
 couple of feet.

Natural beauty: Cameron says highlinging is about relaxing and enjoying a moment of peace out in the natural world, and his photography reflects that

Are you sure that's safe? Cameron says the highliners use two safety ropes to ensure that if they fall, they only drop a few feet before they're left hanging

Adventurous: Cameron's photography focuses on extreme sports and the outdoors, with most of his pictures taken in Southern California

The key to successful highlining is to control your breathing and focus on the other end of the line where it attaches to an object and walk towards that, using outstretched arms for balance.

Cameron says he got into photography by shooting still of him and his friends while he was in high school, before continuing the hobby at college.

Most of his pictures are taken outside in Southern California and capture his athletic friends performing a number of climbing and highlining stunts.

Seeing double: The key to slacklining is to control your breathing, and focus on the point at the other end of the line where it attaches to an object and walk towards that

Watch where you're going: A brave highliner makes his way between two boulders just before the sun sets and it gets too dark to see

Easy does it: The highliners can take up to ten minutes to complete just a short walk as they attempt to focus and use their sense of balance to stop the line from moving
