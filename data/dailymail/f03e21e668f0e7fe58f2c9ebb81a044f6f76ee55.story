Tom Youngs and Salesi Ma'afu have traded blows once more following their scrap during Northampton Saints' 21-20 victory over fierce local rivals Leicester Tigers.

The pair were involved in a punch-up during their heated Aviva Premiership semi-final encounter which saw Northampton prop Ma'afu sent off for his attack on Leicester hooker Youngs, who was sin binned for his involvement, at Franklin's Gardens on Friday.

Let bygones be bygones: Ma'afu (left) and Youngs (right) have since tweeted each over the incident

However, it appears that incident has been forgiven and forgotten as England international Youngs took to Twitter to wish Ma'afu all the best in Saints' final against Saracens on 31 May.

The 27-year-old posted a picture of the duo's punch-up along with the tweet: 'Good shot mate, go well in the final #rocky.'

Australian Ma'afu, who will appear before an RFU disciplinary panel on Tuesday, replied: 'Cheers mate. The jersey can overcome us in the heat of battle. I owe you a pint. #respect.'

In an explosive affair that saw three yellows and a red, Leicetser's replacement fly-half Owen Williams has also been cited by the RFU for making contact with the eye area of Northampton centre Luther Burrell.
