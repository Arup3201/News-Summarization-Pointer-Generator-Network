Louis van Gaal must be planning another soccer-market sweep in the new year, for he cannot seriously maintain that Manchester United can still win the title with a defence as shambolic as it is right now.

Even with yet more investment, however, what guarantee is there of righting those wrongs? The backline which cost them another two points at West Bromwich Albion was hardly assembled on the cheap, £31million Luke Shaw and £16m Marcos Rojo chief among the culprits at The Hawthorns.

Shaw arrived at Old Trafford before Van Gaal and the new manager was quick to question the physical condition of the teenager. On current evidence, this was perhaps more than the mere mind games originally suspected.

Louis van Gaal will need to dip into the transfer market again if he thinks Manchester United can win the title

Rafael - £2.6m

Luke Shaw - £31m

Phil Jones - £16m

Marcos Rojo - £16m

Jonny Evans - Academy

Chris Smalling - £7m

Paddy McNair - Academy

Tyler Blackett - Academy

Reece James - Academy

Total: £72.6m

The acquisition of Rojo, meanwhile, appeared something of a token nod amid the fanfare which accompanied the signings of Angel di Maria and Radamel Falcao – think the strugglers at the back of the class being ignored by the teacher in favour of the star pupils at the front.

The boys at the back did need help. They needed the authority of an experienced centre back to take ownership of their rickety rearguard. They needed full backs with energy and endeavour but also defensive cunning and know-how. 

Perhaps a 19-year-old with the weight of such a hefty price tag was not what they needed, nor a rookie South American minus any exposure to Europe’s top leagues.

At West Brom during Monday’s 2-2 draw, both Shaw and Rojo were negligent in allowing Stephane Sessegnon and then Saido Berahino to breach their backline.

Rafael and Phil Jones emerged with slightly more credit, but that is like arguing the merits of a D-minus as opposed to D-plus - dodgy, dithering and deficient would all be suitable were we to apportion description to the D.

But Van Gaal, bafflingly, claims United can recover to win the Premier League. It was at this juncture last season that David Moyes was making similar noises. 

In fairness, after eight matches, his side had conceded two fewer than Van Gaal’s and trailed the leaders by eight points, as opposed to the 10 they are adrift today. In 2012 – under Sir Alex Ferguson – they were four points off the pace. There is, then, a very definite trend.

In their eighth match of the campaign under Moyes – a 1-1 draw at home to Southampton – Messrs Jones and Rafael were joined by Patrice Evra and Jonny Evans in defence. 

Are Shaw and Rojo really an upgrade on that pair at present? The latter, as a consequence of the former, continues to be played out of position at centre back rather than left back, further emphasising the neglect when it came to strategising defensive reinforcement.

Phil Jones emerged with some credit on Monday night, but United's defence still needs to improve drastically

And what lies beneath? Tyler Blackett, an untried 20-year-old, started the season in the side, while Paddy McNair, an even less experienced 19-year-old, has appeared more recently. 

Talented? Yes. But Blackett and McNair sound more like a good cop/bad cop pairing from an Eighties TV show – and we don’t think they’re ready to crack the case with United’s defence just yet.

Then there is Chris Smalling who, like Jones, has survived amid talk of promise and potential. Ferguson once famously said (although that is fast becoming ‘infamously’) that Jones could go on to become one of the club’s greatest-ever players. Smalling, too, was talked of in equally glowing terms. Neither, however, have subsequently shone, be that for club or country.

The return to fitness of Evans, meanwhile, cannot come soon enough – and there stands a statement few would have anticipated prior to the summer splurge.

United’s next two games are at home to Chelsea and away to Manchester City, where the same personnel will be charged with keeping out the opposition.

But if the likes of Jamie Vardy and Benik Afobe have proved troublesome already this season, you dread to think what terror lies in wait at the feet of Diego Costa and Sergio Aguero.

Indeed, talk of titles could well be hushed in a fortnight’s time.
