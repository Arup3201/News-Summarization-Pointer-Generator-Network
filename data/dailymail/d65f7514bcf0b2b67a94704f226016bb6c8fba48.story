A coroner's report reveals that journalist Michael Hastings had drugs in his system at the time of his fatal car crash in June.

Hastings, who had reportedly been sober for over a decade before relapsing shortly before his death, had traces of amphetamine and marijuana in his blood when he died.

The Los Angeles County coroner's report said that the drugs were not the cause of the fiery crash or his death, as that came due to the massive blunt force trauma that ensued.

The Los Angeles Times also reports that his family were on their way from New York to California on the day of the crash because they wanted to have an intervention due to his relapse.

The results of the toxicology report do not appear to be a surprise to Hasting's relatives, as the coroner added that 'his family was attempting to get (Hastings) to go to detox'.

Relatives told the city officials that after 14-years of sobriety, the 33-year-old reporter that he began using drugs in the month leading up to his June 18 accident.

A post that he wrote on his blog in 2009 confirms that timeline: 'I stopped using when I was nineteen. Good for me.'

His relatives were not the only ones who knew that Hastings had begun using drugs again.

Inferno: Skeptics came up with conspiracy theories about his death but the Los Angeles Coroner ruled that he died of a blunt force trauma, and died almost immediately after impact in the June 18 crash

Beyond Recognition: Authorities had to use a set of fingerprints on file with the FBI to identify his body

Police found a medical marijuana card in his wallet at the scene of the crash.

Hastings, who made his name covering the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq and effectively forcing the firing of former General Stanley McCrystal, was apparently given a prescription for marijuana to treat Post Traumatic Stress Disorder.

In addition to covering warzones, he also lost his fiancee when she was killed in Baghdad, and he wrote a book about the experience.

A number of conspiracy theories surfaced about his death immediately following the early morning June 18 accident as he was revealed to be working on a story about the CIA.

In the know: Relatives were reportedly headed to Los Angeles to have an intervention for Hastings as he had relapsed and started using drugs. His widow, Elise Jordan, says his death was likely just a tragic accident

Surveillance footage near the crash site showed that Hastings was driving the car and sped up before the Mercedes flipped into a palm tree.

His body was so badly burned that he had to be identified using a set of his fingerprints that the FBI had on file.

The agency issued a statement shortly after the fact saying that at no point was he under investigation.

His wife, Elise Jordan, spoke out after his death saying that she did not suspect foul play was involved.

'The LAPD still has an active investigation...my gut here is that it was just a really tragic accident and I'm very unlucky and the world is very unlucky,' she said at the time.
