In an absolute waste of German engineering that would make even the most hardened gearhead weep, a Porsche 918 Spyder went up in flames while refueling at a Toronto gas station.

A video of the burning wreck went viral almost instantly, wracking up nearly 25,000 views.

The car is reportedly owned by Michael Werkerle, CEO of the Difference Capital investment firm and a television personality on Canada's Dragon's Den.

Yahoo reports that witnesses saw gas spilling out as the car refueled, and that it was ignited by the car's twin exhaust pipes.

The Spyder 893 hp hybrid hyper car is an especially rare limited edition with little more than 900 produced for the 2014 model.

The $900,000 car is powered by the combination of its 4.6 L V8 engine along with two electric motors at the front and rear axle.

While the exhaust pipes exit from the back on most vehicles, the Spyder's pipes come out upwards from the engine compartment.Â

Porsche of Canada reps told AutoGuide they were aware of the fire, and while they were still unsure of the cause they would provide technical resources to investigators.

The auto manufacturer is getting uncomfortably familiar with these incidents, having been forced to recall all 911 GT3s vehicles this February after it was discovered they were prone to engine fires.

In this case, no one was physically hurt.

Investigation still underway but witnesses say the blaze was sparked by exhaust pipes meeting a pool of gas as the car refueled
