Sierra Leone's president has made a desperate plea for Australia to up their response to the deadly Ebola virus sweeping West Africa.

In a letter addressed to Prime Minister Tony Abbott, President Ernest Bai Koroma said they need urgent help in the form of military aid, as Sierra Leone is quickly losing the battle against the disease which has already claimed the lives of thousands.

In the letter, dated September 18, Mr Koroma warns the nation's health system had already been overwhelmed by the virus which, according to the World Health Organisation, has claimed 3338 lives and infected 7178 since the beginning of the year.

The president of Sierra Leone has a made a direct request to Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott for help fighting the Ebola outbreak in West Africa

'While we are doing everything possible to stop the outbreak, further support is urgently needed from your friendly government to scale up our national response with ... education efforts, as well as infection control measures,' the letter read.

Mr Koroma makes a specific request for Australia to deploy military health units, logisticians and engineers.

'Having watched the response of the Australian military to similar humanitarian emergencies, most recently Typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines, I know that it is uniquely placed to help us in the fight against Ebola.'

President Ernest Bai Koroma sent a letter to Mr Abbott specifically requesting military aid, medical experts and logistical support

The letter finished with the admission that Sierra Leone is 'counting on Australia' to send the help the country so desperately needs

This comes as Foreign Minister Julie Bishop announced on Thursday Australia would immediately boost its financial contribution to fighting the worst ever outbreak of the deadly disease by another $10 million, taking the total commitment to $18 million.

But so far the Australian government has ruled out sending medical experts and logistical support - which has prompted criticism from aid organisations, including Save the Children and Medecins Sans Frontieres (Doctors Without Borders).

The organisations, while welcoming the additional aid money provided to the cause, were not satisfied with Australia's refusal to send medical aid, as other world leaders deploy troops and medical experts in their thousands.

Mr Koroma also wrote in the letter that Australian military aid could potentially help save thousands of lives.

'We are counting on Australia to send us the military personnel we so desperately need to fight back against the virus and prevent the positive developments of the last 10 years from being undone.'

Ms Bishop on Thursday said the government has assessed that financial contributions were the best and most efficient way Australia could make a rapid contribution to the global response to the crisis.

According to the World Health Organisation Ebola has claimed 3338 lives and infected 7178 since the beginning of the year

The US has committed up to 3000 troops while the UK will spend $185 million on its mission, including supporting 700 Ebola treatment beds across Sierra Leone.

'Make no mistake, this crisis is at tipping point. We need to act urgently and decisively,' Save the Children acting chief Mat Tinkler said.

The UN is seeking $US50 million ($AU54 million) from donors to meet immediate needs over the next four weeks, including for logistics to deliver equipment, materials and supplies to Ebola response operations.
