A Supreme Court judge has ruled that an ICAC inquiry into NSW deputy senior Crown prosecutor Margaret Cunneen SC will go ahead, rejecting a bid by Ms Cunneen, her son Stephen Wyllie and his girlfriend, Sophia Tilley, to have the corruption hearing thrown out.

Justice Clifton Hoeben handed down his decision on Monday afternoon, ruling against Ms Cunneen's contention that the Independent Commission Against Corruption had no right to investigate a 'malicious' complaint which related to her private life.

The ICAC has alleged Ms Cunneen and her son counselled Ms Tilley to fake chest pains to avoid a breath test after a car crash in May.

In the accident, the Mondeo was knocked onto its side and Ms Tilley was trapped in her seat belt for some time and experienced chest pain, fearing that her breast implants may have been ruptured.

Sophia Tilley leaves court after losing her licence in Sydney on Monday over a fifth traffic offence. The incident is unrelated to a car crash she was involved in which is at the centre of a corruption inquiry invetsigatingMs Tilley, her boyfriend Stephen Wyllie and Mr Wyllie's mother, top prosecutor Margaret Cunneen

Ms Tilley is seen leaving the Downing Centre court on Monday after a magistrate suspended her drive's ;icence for a 'fifth' infringement in the last year. Ms Tilley is is part of the ICAC inquiry into Margaret Cunneen, the mother of her boyfriend, Stephen Wyllie, which will now go ahead following a judge's ruling 

Ms Tilley was involved in a car accident in May which is at the centre of the ICAC Inquiry, and appeared in court regarding running a red light in July and a further offence during the Easter weekend

Ms Tilley, Mr Wyllie and his mother, the NSW deputy senior Crown prosecutor, Margaret Cunneen, have failed in their challenge to halt a corruption inquiry into the aftermath of a May 31 car accident in which Ms Tilley was driving Ms Cunneen's car

News of the failed bid emerged as Ms Tilley had her driver's licence suspended in a Sydney court for a traffic offence. The infringement is unrelated to the incident at the centre of the ICAC probe.

Daily Mail Australia has revealed that ICAC investigators seized the mobile telephones of Ms Cunneen, Mr Wyllie and Ms Tilley in unannounced morning raids at their respective homes two months after the accident, on July 30.

In August, Ms Cunneen faced a private hearing over the allegations.

Sophia Tilley departs the Downing Centre Local Court in Sydney on Monday. The 25-year-old property sales assistant, who was appearing on unrelated driving offences, is the woman at the centre of the ICAC probe into crown prosecutor Margaret Cunneen SC, and has had her driver's licence suspended for traffic offences

Inquiry to proceed: The ICAC Corruption inquiry will investigate the aftermath of a car accident on May 31 when Sophia Tilley (above, left) was trapped inside the Ford Mondeo belonging to Margaret Cunneen (above, right) who is the mother of Ms Tilley's boyfriend, Stephen Wyllie (pictured with Ms Tilley). After the crash, she had trouble breathing and feared her breast implants may have ruptured

On October 29, Ms Cunneen, her son and Ms Tilley received a summons to attend a public inquiry into the matter, sparking their court bid to halt the proceedings. 

Ms Cunneen, who has described the accusations as 'malicious', argued the ICAC was acting beyond its jurisdiction and there was no suggestion the allegations involved her conduct as a crown prosecutor. Last week, the three launched court action to stop the inquiry.

A public hearing due to start on Monday was stalled by the 'urgent' court action launched last week. However, Supreme Court Justice Clifton Hoeben, has ruled on Monday afternoon that the ICAC inquiry may go ahead.

Just hours earlier, Ms Tilley had her driver's licence suspended for a traffic offence after appearing in the Downing Centre Local Court for running a red light in Paddington, in Sydney's Eastern Suburbs in July.

A P-plate driver, Ms Tilley has previously pleaded guilty to the traffic light offence, but was appearing in court to appeal the suspension of her licence for another, earlier infringement.

Ms Tilley, a property sales assistant, was driving 100km/h in an 80km/h zone on the way to see her mother on the Easter long weekend.

Ms Tilley's lawyer, Linda Needham said her client had skidded in running the red light during wet weather and that she could lose her job if stripped of her licence.

'She is a woman of good character and is extremely focused on her career,' she said.

But Magistrate Lisa Stapleton said Ms Tilley had a 'very poor' driving record, accruing five offences since renewing her L-plates last year.

'She has a limited history and it is very poor,' she said.

Both incidents are unrelated to the accident on May 31, when Ms Tilley was driving Ms Cunneen's Ford Mondeo and was hit by another vehicle in Willoughby, on Sydney's north shore.

After Ms Tilley was trapped in her seat belt, she telephoned Mr Wyllie and he and his father attended the scene.

Ms Tilley was not at fault in the accident, and a blood test conducted afterwards on her at Royal North Shore Hospital showed no alcohol in her system.

However, the Independent Commission Against Corruption announced late last month it was investigating Ms Cunneen, Ms Tilley and Mr Wyllie over a corruption allegation.

ICAC contends that Mr Wyllie and Ms Cunneen coached Ms Tilley to tell police she had chest pains to avoid being breath tested.

Ms Cunneen will now appeal Justice Hoeben's decision in the NSW Court of Criminal Appeal next Tuesday, November 18.
