With its 12th-century church, clutch of newsagents and parade of  high-street shops, the town of Stevenage, Herts, is a rather unlikely setting for a treasure hunt.

But almost everyone here is taking part in a desperate quest for loot, leaving no stone — or sofa cushion — unturned.

For today is D-Day: the 180th day since someone in the area bought a winning EuroMillions ticket.

The owner of the £2 ticket stands to win almost £64 million — but has until just 11pm tonight to claim their jackpot.

If the ticket isn’t found in time, every penny of the £63,837,543.460 (not to mention the £645,000 interest that the prize money has already accrued) will go to the National Lottery Good Causes fund to be distributed to charities around the country. Should the winning ticket remain elusive, it will represent the largest unclaimed prize in British lottery history.

No wonder everyone who has ever bought a Lottery ticket in Stevenage and nearby Hitchin is frantically checking their coat pockets, rifling through their car’s glove compartment and ransacking the kitchen drawers.

Posters with ‘Are You Missing £63.8 Million?’ in a big black and yellow font are plastered to shop windows.

‘It’s non-stop,’ says Shilla Sachania, who runs the Chocolate Box news-agent on Stevenage High Street with her husband Umesh. There, more than 1,000 Lottery tickets are sold each week.

‘Everybody’s been checking their ticket to see if they won,’ says Shilla. ‘We’ve had people come in and try to claim with other tickets — all sorts of combinations.

‘There have been tickets dating back months but none with the right  combination of numbers.

‘One customer employed a cleaner especially to sweep through her house and see if it was under a sofa anywhere — but it wasn’t. Imagine losing such a valuable ticket!’

The prize money would allow the winner to buy 339 houses at the  average Stevenage price of £190,000  or — should the urge take them — more than two million bottles of champagne.

It would also make them a good deal richer than the commuter town’s most glamorous son, F1 driver Lewis Hamilton (who is worth a reported £55 million), and almost three times wealthier than local Harry Potter star Rupert Grint (worth a relatively paltry £24 million).

Ever since the winning numbers were announced on June 8, Camelot has been urging locals to find and check any tickets they may have forgotten about or lost.

Vans bearing the slogan ‘It Could Be You’ have been driven around town. Leafleteers have been stationed on the High Street.

They even erected a giant sofa a few weeks ago to encourage residents to look under their cushions.

Theories as to what could have happened to the ticket abound. A popular one is that the owner lost it after a few too many at the local Marquis of Lorne pub.

‘I’ve had punters come in and ask if I’ve seen anything lying around,’ says barman Tony Geary.

‘One guy bought a ticket then went out that night, before going on  holiday. When he came back he was moving house and couldn’t find his ticket, so he thought it could be here. But it wasn’t.’

Another theory is that the winner has moved abroad — or even died. Far more likely is that the ticket has simply been misplaced or thrown away by mistake.

Camelot deals with countless claims from people who’ve lost their ticket. Most come to nothing.

In 2001 Martyn Tott, a purchasing manager from Watford, missed out on a jackpot of £3,011,065 after losing his ticket. Using computer records, he was able to prove the winning ticket was his but Camelot refused to pay out — since the rules state that the winner must have their ticket to claim their fortune.

The decision sparked a national furore, with even the then Prime  Minister Tony Blair championing Mr Tott’s cause — but all in vain. Despite three lengthy court cases against Camelot he ended up without a penny.

In 2004, £7 million went unclaimed in Belfast, and in September 2007 a £6.9 million win wasn’t claimed in Devon.

So far, the largest unclaimed sum is £9.4 million, on a ticket that was bought in Doncaster in July 2005.

Camelot’s Simon Horne says: ‘We all want winners to get their money but there must be a deadline.

Otherwise every prize would just go on indefinitely. But this way billions of pounds have gone to good causes over the years — from funding the Olympics through bodies like Sport England to local playgroups and Scout clubs.’

Still, the psychological fallout of a near miss can be devastating.

After Mr Tott was denied his millions he plunged into depression, separated from his partner and moved to America, where he joined an evangelical cult. He has since returned and, claiming to have found happiness, written a book about his ordeal.

Residents in Stevenage can readily imagine the pain of losing a winning ticket. Marion Johnson, 56, a human resources manager, says: ‘Can you imagine? It would be awful. It’s money that could completely change your life. If that were me, I’d feel sick.’

Not to mention more than a little bit silly. After all, how could anyone misplace a piece of paper that could change their lives so dramatically?

‘They don’t deserve to win if you ask me,’ puffs 75-year-old retired telecoms engineer Don Collins.

His wife Sheila agrees. ‘Who plays the Lottery and doesn’t check their ticket?’ she says. 

Deadline: An unlucky lottery winner stands to lose £64million unless they claim their prize by 11pm

Others are more sympathetic.

At the Boys To Men Barbers on the High Street, Craig Chalkright has been searching through his shop after losing a ticket he bought on the same day as the elusive winner.

‘I’ve looked everywhere,’ he says. ‘In the end I called Camelot and told them when and where I bought it. They wrote back to me with a photocopy of my ticket, proving that I had not won anything.’

Of course, the treasure hunt would not be needed if Camelot revealed  the precise place where the winning ticket was sold.

Purchasing records mean that they can easily identify the shop — but the company’s licence forbids it from making that information public in order to maximise the winner’s chances of anonymity.

Retired shop worker Desmond Wales says this is wrong and that Camelot should check CCTV footage in the shop where the ticket was sold.

‘It would save the rest of us a lot of bother,’ he adds.

Still not knowing if they sold the ticket, newsagents Shilla and Umesh Sachania have erected a huge  mock-up of what the winning ticket would look like.

They say: ‘It would be brilliant if someone claimed the money at the last minute. Hopefully they’d share it out. It would be very exciting.’

Very exciting indeed — though with only hours left to track down the ticket, the chances are fast dwindling.

But, you never know. Three years ago, a Lottery winner scooped £2.5 million just before the 180-day deadline expired.

So, Stevenage, keep rummaging — it could still be you.
