Next time a 6’6” NFL player weighing 265lbs runs in her direction in full football gear, it would be probably be advisable to get out of the way.

Dallas Cowboys tight end Jason Witten, 29, ran out of bounds in a game and ended up taking down a cheerleader rooting for his own team.

Last night's incident seemed to stun rather than injure Melissa Kellerman, 22, who was helped up and found the whole thing very amusing.

Oh my gosh! Dallas Cowboys tight end Jason Witten takes down Melissa Kellerman after being forced out of bounds at the game in Arlington, Texas

Dallas Cowboys tight end Jason Witten ran out of bounds in the game...

... and he ended up taking down 22-year-old cheerleader Melissa Kellerman...

... who was stunned rather than injured by the incident on Thursday night...

... and promptly got up unharmed, looking to be rather amused by what happened

Witten caught a Tony Romo pass but was forced out in the fourth quarter of a 20-19 win over the Miami Dolphins, reported the Los Angeles Times.

However he could not stop as he left the field and pulled her over with his right arm. Some viewers speculated that he was trying to protect her.

‘Jason saved her - with his momentum and the defenders momentum, she could have really gotten hit badly,’ YouTube user cowboys4life956 said.

‘So by him grabbing her he didn't bulldoze her,’ he added. Miss Kellerman later tweeted about the incident and said she was feeling fine.
