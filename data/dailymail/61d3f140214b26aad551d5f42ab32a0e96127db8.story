A young woman, who was abandoned as a newborn in a hospital bathroom stall, has made an emotional return to the scene last week in a quest to find her birth mother.

The 20-year-old, who did not want to reveal her real name but was called 'baby Katie' by nurses, was left in a female bathroom at Salem Hospital in July 1992.

It was only when she returned to the Oregon hospital recently to be treated for an inflamed pancreas that she decided it was time to answer questions about where she came from.

The baby was adopted a few days later but now the young woman is hoping to be reunited with her birth mother.

However she did have the chance to meet nurses Brenda Peulen and Denise Ehredt who cared for her two decades ago.

The woman, who is studying to be a nurse, went back to the bathroom stall where she was left at just a few days old, weighing 3lb 5oz.

She told katu.com: 'It brings back a lot of emotion for me. I feel like I’m in 
the moment. This is where I was left. It's hard to believe this is 
where I was left. It's a bathroom.'

The 20-year-old said that if she ever finds her mother she would like to ask why she left her and whether she has any brothers and sisters.

She added that she did not blame her mother for her actions but simply wanted to meet her.

Nurse Ehredt added: 'It's just great to see this kind of ending of a story that had a unique beginning. What a delightful young lady she is.'
