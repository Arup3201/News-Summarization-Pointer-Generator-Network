The top executive for Nine has broken his silence on his public street brawl with childhood friend and billionaire James Packer, nearly a year since it made headlines.

David Gyngell revealed during a recent radio interview that he felt 'ashamed' about the fight and how wife Leila McKinnon had called him 'an idiot' soon after the incident, news.com.au reports.

Mr Gyngell and Mr Packer, both media moguls, were seen in a physical dispute on the streets of Bondi, Sydney's eastern suburbs, in May.

It is believed the fight started over 47-year-old Mr Packer's alleged relationship with supermodel Miranda Kerr, 31, soon after his separation from ex-wife Erica Baxter.

During an interview on 2GB, Mr Gyngell spoke about his wife's reaction upon telling her about the punch-up.

'Coming home to my wife, she said: 'What happened? You've done what?' And then she said: 'You idiot,' he told radio host Ray Hadley.

'And then she sees the photos and was more upset of how badly dressed I was and how I hadn't had a shave.'

Leila McKinnon, who's the host of Channel Nine Inside Story, also recently commented on the melee and said in an interview with Australian Women's Weekly: 'I do wish he'd worn shoes'.

Daily Mail Australia reported last year that Mr Gyngell, 48, allegedly confronted his friend outside his Sydney home and the pair began rowing about Mr Packer's treatment of his estranged spouse.

The two men had to be separated by bodyguards and were later fined $500 each by NSW Police for 'offensive behaviour'.

Mr Gyngell accepted responsibility for the fight and pledged to co-operate with the police investigation into the incident.

'He fully accepts that he was the instigator of the incident,' a spokesman said. 

'Clearly, had he not turned up at Packer's premises in an angry mood then the confrontation would never have occurred.'

The pair reportedly told friends afterwards that they regretted the fight.
