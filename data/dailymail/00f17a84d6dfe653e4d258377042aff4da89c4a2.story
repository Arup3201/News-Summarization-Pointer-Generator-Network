A New Zealand Olympic barbecue party turned to panic when two gas canisters exploded, forcing more than 300 guests to flee for their lives.

The Antipodean sports fans had gathered to watch their compatriots compete in the evening athletics session last night in the garden of the country's pop-up hospitality house in King's Cross.

But just as chefs began handing out burgers and sausages at around 7.20pm, partygoers noticed blue flames beginning to engulf the fuel cylinders used to fire the grill.

The alarm was sounded and guests scattered into the street screaming.

Panic: The Antipodean sports fans had gathered to watch their compatriots compete in the Games' evening session last night in the garden of the country's hospitality house in King's Cross

Minutes later the blast tore through the garden with such force that the barbecue roof was blown into the air.

Brook Johnstone, 55, from Port Waikato, said: 'I looked around and the gas bottle had a little flame around it.

'The cook was trying to put it out and the flame just got bigger so I just said ‘Let’s get out of here’.

'We got inside and everyone was evacuated.'

Mr Johnstone, who is in London on holiday, said the canister exploded with such force that it blew the roof off the barbecue area.

New Zealander and Leeds University student Sonia Holland, who is also working as a volunteer Games Maker at the Olympics, said she was not aware of any athletes in attendance.

The 19-year-old, from Napier, said: 'I literally just got my food and there was a big kerfuffle around the barbecue area.

Danger: A plume of black smoke filled the air and could be seen for miles across London

Evacuation: Ambulance crews arrived but fortunately nobody was hurt

'Everyone was pushed inside but then people were telling us to get out of the building.

'They got everyone out of the building as fast as they could. I was out within two minutes.'

She said when she looked back at the building she could see fire and smoke coming from the garden.

Shortly after the fire, Kiwi House tweeted: 'We've had a rather large fire engulf the outdoor bbq area. Everyone is ok. We're closed till further notice. More updates as they happen.'

Fortunately no one was hurt after all guests were evacuated safely.

Compatriots: The guests had gathered to watch their compatriots compete, including Stacey Michelsen, left, in the Women's Field Hockey Semifinal match against the Netherlands and Sarah Walker, right, in the BMX competition

Despite their Olympic home from home being closed until further notice, some New Zealanders were able to make light of the situation.

One witness told 3 News: 'My 
girlfriend came in and she was like, "Move out of the way, move out of 
the way, there's a gas bottle on fire!" And I was like, "Well, I need to
get me card, and I want to get some sauce for my pie."'

On Twitter 'Ross' joked: 'Not to be outdone by Aus gold
medal count NZ house has decided to step in and show the world how to 
BBQ Kiwi style!'

James Elliott added: 'The 
instruction as I recall it was to always blow on the pie not blow up the
pie. #kiwihouse.'

Ten firefighters attended and a cordon was put around the building in case another gas cylinder exploded.

Richard Welch, station manager of Poplar fire station, said: 'People in the vicinity reported hearing an explosion, which was due to two gas cylinders exploding before firefighters arrived on the scene.

'Crews have now brought the blaze under control and are cooling a further two gas cylinders down to make them safe.

'Around 300 people were evacuated from nearby buildings and as a precaution we’ve set up a temporary safety cordon of around 50 metres.

'Fortunately it doesn’t look as though anyone was injured.'

Kiwi House is self-described as a 'haven' for friends, family and supporters of the New Zealand Olympic team.
