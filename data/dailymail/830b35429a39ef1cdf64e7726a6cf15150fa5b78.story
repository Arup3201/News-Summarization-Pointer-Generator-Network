It is the inspiration behind an iconic fantasy castle which has enchanted children and adults across the world for decades.

And now a stunning French palace said to have helped inspire the creation of Walt Disney's magical Cinderella Castle could be all yours - it's up for sale for £18million.

With its lavish art noveau interior and decked out in head to toe with Pyrenean marble, the Chateau d'Aubiry really is a fairy-tale home and is attracting the attention of billionaire moguls and Euromillions lottery winners.

But the beautiful 19th century masterpiece looks nothing like Disney's interpretation of a castle fit for a princess.

Fairy tale home: The Chateau d'Aubiry, said to have been one of the inspirations behind Walt Disney's Cinderella Castle, is up for sale for £18million

The chateau, located on the Les Aspres mountain chain in the Pyrenees close to the town of Perpignan, boasts 15 bedrooms, a chapel, vineyards, a wine cellar and more than 12 acres of sprawling yet immaculately kept gardens.

The 26,910 square foot property, which was built by former baker and cigarette paper inventor Jean Bardou, is on the market with Zenith Sotheby's and is said to have attracted quite a stir among interested parties.

A source at the prestigious estate agent said: 'The fabulous home has superb panoramic views facing south and is protected by the mountains from the infamous tramontane winds.

'It is all lavishly decorated in the style art nouveau and has all the luxurious features that anyone could dream of.

'There has been plenty of interested parties who have expressed an interest - it really is a once in a lifetime chance to own such a property.'

Stunning: The chateau is decked out with Pyrenean marble throughout and beautiful works of art

Has potential: As well as the main building, the chateau has a number of outbuildings in its grounds, some of which would need some work

Ostentatious: The beautiful interior of the chateau features some stunning art and frescoes painted by a pair of Parisian artists

The impressive chateau has its own billiard room, music room, library and scullery and some of the bedrooms are themed, including a Chinese room decorated in honour of the last emperor of Indo China Bao Dai.

Designed by highly regarded Danish architect Vigo Dorph Peterson, the property was commissioned in 1894 and work was finaly completed in 1900.

The beautiful frescoes throughout the castle were painted by Parisian artists Gervais and Henry Perrault.

The stunning grounds of Chateau d'Aubiry feature a winding river, a swimming pool, water features and a Japanese bridge.

It is said to be one of several real and fictional castles that inspired Walt Disney's Cinderella Castle - still the flagship attraction at Disney World in the US and Tokyo DisneyLand in Japan.

As well as Chateau d'Aubiry, other fairy tale properties including Fontainebleau in Versailles, the Chateaux of Cheronceau, Pierrefonds, Chambord and Chaumont, Bavaria's Castle Neuschwanstein, Moszna in Poland, and Craigievar Castle in Aberdeen are said to have inspired Disney's creation.

Disney World's version of the castle was completed in July 1971 after 18 months of construction work.

It had originally been designed with rooms for Walt Disney and his family to stay in when they visited Florida, but the animator died from lung cancer in 1966.

The rooms were left unfinished for more than three decades, and have now been turned into an exclusive 'money can't buy' hotel suite.

The fantasy castle itself, designed by Herbert Ryman, is 190ft tall and is surrounded by a 6ft deep moat.

An optical trick known as forced perspective makes the castle appear bigger than it really is.

The Tokyo version of the castle is a carbon copy of the US one.
