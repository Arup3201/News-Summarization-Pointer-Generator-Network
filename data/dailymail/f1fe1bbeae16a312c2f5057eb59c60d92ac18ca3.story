Freedom: Christopher Tappin, 65, leaves court after being held in custody for two months while he awaits trial

A retired British businessman extradited to the United States over arms dealing charges will go on trial in November.

Christopher Tappin, 65, who could face up to 35 years in jail if convicted, will stand before a judge on 5 November in El Paso, Texas.

The millionaire, from Orpington, Kent, who has surrendered his British passport to U.S. Marshals and is on bail in Texas, denies trying to sell batteries for surface-to-air missiles in Iran.

Mr Tappin's wife, Elaine, and his family said: ‘It's taken seven long months to get this date for trial.

‘Despite the much-welcomed support from friends and strangers alike, the emotional, financial and psychological impact of extradition on all the family is hard to overstate.'

Mr Tappin is currently on bail.

The former president of Kent Gold Union is living with Dan Cogdell, one of his lawyers, at his family home in Montgomery County, near Houston as part of the conditions set by the judge that set bail.

He must wear an electronic tag at all times and his travel is limited to within two Texas counties as well as the border city of El Paso for court appearances.

Mrs Tappin added: ‘Whilst Chris's living conditions are
 immeasurably better since he was granted bail in April, we remain a 
family divided by 5,000 miles.

‘Health, jobs, family life and cost have considerably limited the opportunity for long distance visits.

‘As a result, we question the need to extradite before a country is trial-ready.

‘However we are relieved to now have a
 date on which we are all focused. We trust this will bring an end to 
this ordeal for us all.’

Mr Tappin was extradited to the U.S. in February after losing a protracted legal battle before the High Court.

He was held in Otero County 
Detention Centre – a maximum-security prison in the New Mexico desert 
which houses accused murderers – and appeared in court in a prison 
jumpsuit and walking in shackles.

His extradition followed an investigation which started 
in 2005 when US agents asked technology providers about buyers who might
 have raised red flags.

During the investigation, undercover companies started by government 
agencies approached his customers.

An
 associate of Mr Tappin, Briton Robert Gibson, agreed to help investigators with their enquiries and was jailed for 24 months after pleading guilty 
to conspiracy to export defence articles.

Mr Gibson handed over 16,000 computer
 files and emails to customs agents leading police to believe he had 
long-standing commercial ties with Iranian customers.

American Robert Caldwell was also found guilty of aiding and abetting 
the illegal transport of defence articles and served 20 months in 
prison.

Mr Tappin denies the charges.

His case has fuelled the row over the fairness of the extradition treaty between the UK and the US.

Attorney General Dominic Grieve QC 
said Mr Tappin’s extradition highlighted problems with the treaty which 
were not ‘readily curable’, warning that many Britons were left uneasy 
when faced with the seemingly harsh and disproportionate sentences in 
the American justice system.

Other critics of the 2003 treaty, including Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, have deemed it ‘one-sided’.
