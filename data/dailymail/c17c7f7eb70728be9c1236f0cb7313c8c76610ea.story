Google has been forced to deny killing a donkey with its Street View car in Botswana.

Images of the animal lying at the side of a dirt track in the Kweneng region of the African country spread online earlier this week.

This lead to complaints and accusations of a Google hit-and-run from concerned members of the public.

As the Street View car approaches, the donkey is shown lying at the side of the road. Concerned members of the public complained to Google and some accused it of hit-and run

The donkey is then shown getting up and moving out of the way of the Street View car. Google said the animal was 'perhaps enjoying a dust bath'

In its official blog, the Californian-based company denied the accusations saying the donkey was ‘alive and well’.

Kei Kawai, Group Product Manager at Google Maps added, ‘Because
 of the way our 360-degree imagery is put together, it looked to some 
that our car had been involved in an unseemly hit and run, leaving the 
humble beast stranded in the road.’

He then went on to say the donkey ‘was perhaps enjoying a dust bath’.

Google also released a series of images to prove its innocence.

The pictures show the Street View car approaching the donkey while it’s laid out on the road.

And another two of the donkey stood up after the car has passed it.
