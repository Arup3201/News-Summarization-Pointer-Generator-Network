A 911 call made by a horrified restaurant worker after finding her co-worker dead in a dumbwaiter reveals the terrible extent of the 21-year-old victim's injuries.

The unnamed employee of Fountain City's WingDam Saloon and Grill in Winona, Minnesota, had evidently opened the elevator used to shuttle drinks between floors to find a Brooke Baures in an unspeakable state.

'I think one of my co-workers got (caught) in, like, our dumbwaiter,' the co-worker told a 911 operator just before 8m Monday. 'But I'm not willing to look close enough.' 

The woman asked another employee to look at the apparently contorted remains. 'It's her. We need someone here like ASAP,' she told the operator in a recording obtained by the Winona Daily News.

Police so far have found no witnesses to help them in the investigation of the death of Brooke Baures who was found in a dumbwaiter where she worked 

As students of Winona State University mourned, and held a candlelit vigil for their friend, local authorities began trying to peace together what killed the beloved college gymnast.

After days, they still couldn't find anyone among two dozen witnesses who'd seen her get into the 3x3 machine, though they remained confident no crime had been committed.

'[She] was found trapped inside the entirety of the device,' Fountain City Police Chief Jason Mork revealed. 'To explain more of her specific location, orientation or obvious injuries would require an extremely graphic explanation.'

Mork said Wednesday he has interviewed about half of the customers and employees present at the WingDam Saloon and Grill Monday night, and that, so far, no one saw how the student entered the dumbwaiter.

Mork said he has talked face-to-face with about 14 of the 28 potential witnesses and said there was no indication how or why Baures entered the food elevator. It was not something employees had done in the past, he said. 

Baures was found at the bottom of a dumb waiter on Monday at the bar and grill where she worked in Wisconsin.

Last night her teammates from Winona State University led the tributes to the talented gymnast, saying 'she was literally everything to the team.' 

Brooke Hiestand, a member of Winona State Warriors, said: 'She was the person that held us together, and if you had something that you didn't know what to do...for some reason, she always knew the answer...always.'

Police investigating the death said they haven't found a single witness to explain how the gymnast ended up dead in a food elevator.

Fountain City Police Officer Jason Mork said he had interviewed half of the customers and employees at the WingDam Saloon and Grill in Wisconsin on Monday night.

Autopsy results are still pending, but officers have not found any indication that her death was caused by foul play. 

Chief Mork said the dumbwaiter's opening is about 3ft by 3ft and the service elevator connects the first and second floors. 

Police said she was trapped in the small elevator when they arrived.  

Miss Baures, an accomplished athlete, was twice named the Wisconsin Intercollegiate Athletic Conference gymnast of the week this year and documented her athletics career enthusiastically on social media.

She was described by friends and family as a 'strong, determined, and beautiful young woman' at the candlelit vigil held on the University campus.

Her boyfriend  Joel Hinke, who played for the Winona State Warriors football team, broke down as he spoke about how he had planned to marry her. 

The college paid tribute to Baures who was an accomplished member of the gymnastics team from 2011 to 2014. 

'She was a leader on the team and a talented gymnast,' said WSU athletic director Eric Schoh in a statement. 

'This is a tremendous loss for our community, and we ask that you keep Brooke and her family, friends, coaches and teammates in your thoughts.'

Amanda Schabacker, manager at WingDam Saloon & Grill, told the Winona Daily News that the restaurant would be closed on Tuesday and refused to offer any more comment. 

Photographs posted to social media show Brooke and her family happily posing for pictures at Warriors games. 

The 21-year-old was also a huge music fan and on her Facebook page posted a picture on November 22 with herself and country music stars Dan + Shay along with the caption: 'OMG OMG'.

Tributes from distraught friends have been flooding onto social media since her death was announced on December 1.

Friend Annelie Schmittel posted: 'Thoughts and prayers go out to the family of my former student Brooke Baures, as well as my WSU Warriors family. Devastating news.'

According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration, dumbwaiter accidents are rare. 

According to the OSHA database, only two incidents, both fatal, have happened in the U.S. between 2003 and 2013.
