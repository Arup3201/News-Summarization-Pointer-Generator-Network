A pair of huge Chinese vases that stood in the entrance hall of a couple's modest home for 35 years are tipped to sell at auction for £70,000 - despite being bought for a just a few hundred pounds.

The 5ft tall porcelain pieces, made in the Far East in 1840 for the export market, were bought by the unidentified  family in the early 1970s and have since featured at their home in Harrogate, North Yorkshire.

Before that, the vases formed part of the display at Cliff Castle, near Keighley, West Yorkshire, the former home of textile magnate Henry Butterfield.

These 5ft Chinese vases, pictured here with auction assistant Robyn Alderson, have been sat in a couple's hallway for 35 years and are set to fetch up to £70,000 in auction next week - despite being bought for just a few hundred pounds

But when Mr Butterfield's home was left to the local council in 1949, the vases were sold off and bought by the current owners.

Now the couple has chosen to sell the vases because of the incredibly-buoyant state of the Chinese art market.

The vases used to be featured in Cliff Castle, near Keighley, West Yorkshire, before the property was sold by Henry Butterfield's family

Nigel Smith, of auctioneers Tenants 
Auctioneers in Leyburn, North Yorkshire, said: 'These two vases are 
unusually large, about 5ft tall.

'The
 owners have had them on display in the hallway of their home in 
Harrogate but are now selling them because the market for Chinese art is
 very lively at the moment to say the least.'

The baluster vases are painted in famille rose enamels with court scenes in gardens and interiors and with birds in branches.

They have some minor chipping to the edges extremities.

Mr Smith added: 'They
 stood in the drawing room of Cliffe Castle.

'They were sold off in 1949 
and then again to the present owners in the early 1970s.

'They were made to be exported and are purely decorative rather than practical purposes.

'The vases are quite rare simply because of their huge size.'

The auction takes place on July 25.
