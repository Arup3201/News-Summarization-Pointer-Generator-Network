A teenage hairdresser was groped by an NHS doctor during an examination where he told her 'you’re very beautiful', a court heard today.

Dr Kamal Abusin, 54, is accused of treating the hairdresser as 'a model' rather than a vulnerable patient.

The 19-year-old woman went to A&E with stomach pains after having an operation.

A court heard Abusin told the teenager she was 'very beautiful' before stroking her breast and groping her during the stomach examination.

The court heard that after the 20-minute examination, she walked into the waiting room and burst into tears when her boyfriend asked her how it had gone.

Assault: Dr Kamal Abusin, 54, is accused of sexually assaulting a young woman during an examination in A&E

Prosecutor Janet McDonald said Dr Abusin had abused his 'position of trust and authority' to sexually assault the young woman.

Miss McDonald said: 'This was not a nightclub where a drunken reveller might try it on and go too far with a pretty girl.

'This was a consultant room with a sober and senior consultant in attendance.

'The groping or touching are very serious to this young woman and for society.

'We put trust in the medical profession to deal with a patient appropriately. We don’t expect to be groped.'

A&E: The woman was assaulted after she went to Royal Glamorgan Hosiptal in Llantrisant, South Wales. She was suffering stomach pains following an operation

Cardiff Crown Court heard the young woman, who cannot be named, had undergone keyhole surgery 'just below her belly button' six weeks earlier.

She went to the Royal Glamorgan Hospital in Llantrisant, South Wales, complaining of abdominal pain in February this year.

The jury heard Dr Abusin lifted her top to 'remove a hair' before groping her.

Miss McDonald said: 'She was called into the room by the doctor and he made comments about her appearance before telling her to lie on the examination table.

'He told her she was beautiful, had a well proportioned body, a good figure and asked her to take her hair down.

'She trusted him and did what he asked.

'Was he looking at her as a patient or more as one might admire the physique of a model?

'He didn’t ask her to assist and pushed her top up so he could see her tummy and this exposed one of her breasts in her bra.

'He went to remove a strand of hair that was on her right breast - and he took the opportunity to grope her breast.

'This was not the way he was supposed to examine her tummy.'

Miss McDonald said this made the young patient 'uncomfortable' - and she tried to get the doctor to concentrate on diagnosing the cause of her stomach pains.

But during the stomach examination with his hands he ran them up her thighs and touched her intimately - over the top of her leggings.

Miss McDonald told the court: 'There was absolutely no reason for him to do that.

'It was not a medical examination - it was the doctor sexually assaulting a vulnerable patient.

'He did examine her tummy but then put his hands down onto her pubic bone and left it there before a hand back on the inside of her thigh.

'She sat up thoroughly unnerved by the situation and asked him what she should do next about the pain she was suffering from.

'He gave her some advice about going back to the GP.

'As she walked left the room she walked straight out and burst into tears and told her boyfriend what had happened.'

Dr Abusin, a consultant surgeon, 'vehemently denied' the accusations when questioned by police

The young woman immediately told her concerned boyfriend and asked the A&E receptionist how she could complain.

Dr Abusin, who is originally from Sudan but was doing shifts in hospitals around Britain, was arrested by police soon after the complaint.

The consultant surgeon 'vehemently denied' all accusations of sexual assault when questioned by police.

He said the examination as outlined by the young woman was not one that would be required from a medical point of view and was not what he had given her.

Dr Abusin, of Vauxhall Bridge Road, London, denies two charges of sex assault.

The trial continues.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
