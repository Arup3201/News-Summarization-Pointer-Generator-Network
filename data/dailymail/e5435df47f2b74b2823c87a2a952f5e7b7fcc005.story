A mother and her three children are fighting for their lives today after her jilted former-boyfriend set himself on fire during a row at their family home.

The 30-year-old, is believed to have doused himself with petrol and turned himself into a human torch after apparently turning up at the home of 40-year old Tracy Jones in the early hours of this morning.

As he went up in flames, Tracy and eldest daughter Cailin, 18, tried to put out the fire but the blaze ripped through the ground floor of the family’s £120,000 semi detached house in Altrincham, Greater Manchester.

'I looked out my bedroom window, saw smoke and I told my partner to call the fire brigade. I dashed out of the house as fast as I could and I could see the daughter was already on the grass outside.

'The front door was locked but the downstairs window was open and I managed to pull the window off the hinges. I could see Tracy and I managed to tug her through the window frame.

'She was conscious but in obvious 
shock and was screaming and hysterical. I wasn’t thinking anything about
my own safety - it was pure adrenalin was driving me to get her out.

'I
got the mum out and ran around the back and that’s where the older son 
was, but that was locked, so I pulled the back window off but the smoke 
was too much.

'Then the 
emergency services came and I told them that someone was in the kitchen 
and the little lad was upstairs in his bedroom.

It’s such a tragedy. This is a quiet neighbourhood and they were a lovely family who always said hello.'

Another
neighbour Bernadette Fleming, a cleaner, 55, said: 'I woke up to hear 
Tracy screaming through the window: "my baby, my baby." I thought I was 
dreaming at first then Iooked out to see all hell breaking loose.

'I will never forget those terrible 
screams. I was only speaking to Tracy last week. I went down to the gate
and I could see all this smoke. It shook me up a hell of a lot. None of
us knows who the dead man is. We didn’t even know Tracy had a 
boyfriend.'

Phil 
Berkovitch, 59, a gas engineer said: 'We do each other favours. She was 
only here the other week because her phone wasn’t working so we are more
than just neighbours, we’re friends. They are a close-knit family and 
very friendly.

Fire, police and forensic officers search for clues following the blaze in the early hours of this morning. Tracy Jones jilted lover died after setting fire to himself

'I saw the fire, we heard a commotion and came rushing out just as the fire engine came up. By that time the fire was downstairs. I’m not too sure if they were all out at that time. We knew that Kevin had pulled Tracy out.

'The little lad was carried out by the fire brigade and Tracy was hysterical. She got carried off strapped into a chair.

'Kevin did great a job in getting her out. If he wasn’t there, she might not have been able to get out. You never think that this is going to happen. This kind of thing happens only in the soaps.'
