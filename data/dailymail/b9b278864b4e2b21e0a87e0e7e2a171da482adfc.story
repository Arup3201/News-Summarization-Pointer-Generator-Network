Tanya Miller, 30, from Carlisle, took her eight-month-old baby with her on an armed robbery in Silloth

A mother-of-four who took her eight-month-old baby with her as she acted as getaway driver in an armed robbery has been jailed.

Tanya Miller, 30, had the baby girl with her in a car seat as she drove from her home in Carlisle to the Cumbrian town of Silloth for the knifepoint raid at a branch of the Cumberland Building Society.

A judge described this as one of the 'most troubling' aspects of the case as Miller appeared in court to answer for her role in the hold-up, which left a member of staff 'absolutely traumatised'.

Carlisle Crown Court heard that Miller, of Harraby, was the 'wheels' in the raid while her boyfriend Barry Doswell, 26, also of Harraby, was 'back-up'.

The pair were due to stand trial for robbery on Wednesday but both pleaded guilty before their trial got underway.

Yesterday Miller and Doswell were both sentenced to six years in jail for robbery.

The court heard that their accomplice Kevin Docherty, 34, of no fixed address, went into the building society in the quiet town overlooking the Solway Firth armed with a knife and stole nearly £3,000.

Docherty entered the branch wearing a white jacket, with most of his face covered by a hood, carrying the 12 inch blade.

He walked up to the till and demanded money from the cashier, threatening to kill her.

The cashier then handed the man over £2900 in cash and subsequently left the branch.

Witnesses then saw a blue Ford Focus park up in a lane which runs between Station Road and Eden Street.

A male matching the description got out of the vehicle then entered the Building Society.

A short time later the witness saw the man return to the vehicle and enter the boot of the car and the vehicle then drove off towards Eden Street, with the baby still in the car seat.  

The raid, in April, sparked a huge police manhunt operation involving road blocks and a helicopter, though no-one was injured.

Judge Paul Batty QC said a female employee at the building society was left 'absolutely traumatised' by the raid.

The judge also noted that Miller had her eight-month-old child with her, who is believed to be Miller and Doswell's daughter.

Addressing Doswell and Miller - Docherty was not in court for the hearing - Judge Batty said: 'Each of you played an integral part.

Yesterday Miller, was jailed for six years at Carlisle Crown Court after admitting robbery. She drove the getaway car and took her eight-month-old daughter with her 

Barry Doswell, left, was jailed for six years while Kevin Docherty, right, was sentenced to seven years in prison 

'A custodial sentence of considerable length is quite inevitable.'

Docherty was also sentenced to seven years for robbery and possesing an offensive weapon in a public place.

Speaking after the sentence was passed, Detective Inspector Ian Harwood said: 'Kevin Docherty subjected the cashiers to a horrendous and needless ordeal whilst making threats brandishing a knife.

'The courts have shown that this sort of behaviour will not be tolerated in this county and should be taken as a stern warning to any criminal contemplating committing such a crime.

'I’d like to pay tribute to the both the victims and the witnesses to the robbery for their bravery and tenacity in assisting police put these three in prison.

'Understandably this incident caused great distress to innocent members of the public and we are happy that justice has been served and these three people are being removed from society.'

In the last post on their joint Facebook page, Doswell wrote to Miller: 'My baby u so so sexy so proud ta say your my wifey 2b cant wait 2be your husband n make u mrs doswell youve made me a proud dad and give me 4 beautiful kids i lvs them so so much my girl you mean the world 2me beautiful lvs ya millions 4eva xxx. 

To which Miller replied: 'Luvs ya millions baby xx.'
