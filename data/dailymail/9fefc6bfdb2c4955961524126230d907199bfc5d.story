An email exchange between Travis Alexander and one of his best friends has suggested he was a womanizer who used Jodi Arias physically and called her a 'skank'.

In the correspondence from 2007, his friend Sky Hughes, who testified in Arias' murder trial, called him emotionally abusive and a 'heart predator' who liked to collect women.

The emails were submitted by the Arias defense but never used in the Arizona court as the judge called them 'hearsay', but a copy has now been obtained by the Arizona Republic.

They could help paint an image of Alexander, who was found stabbed, shot and with a sliced throat in his apartment in 2008, as emotionally abusive to Arias, his ex-girlfriend and alleged killer.

'Manipulative': Unreleased emails from a friend of Travis Alexander, left, accuse him of being emotionally abusive towards Jodi Arias, right, who killed him in his Arizona home in 2008

Arias claimed that she killed him in self defense after he became enraged at her for dropping a camera. Prosecutors assert she murdered him in a fit of jealousy as he was seeing another woman.

The emails from Hughes, who testified in the trial, show that in January 2007 she and her husband warned Arias she should move on from Alexander because of how he treated women.

'Travis, with love, you are a heart 
predator,' Hughes wrote. 'You take great joy in making women fall for the T-dogg. You 
laugh about what you can get away with.

'It would scare me to death if my
little sister liked you, in fact I wouldn't allow it.'

When Alexander learned from Arias that Hughes had warned her against him, he responded angrily.

Warning: The emails were sent from Sky Hughes, pictured, a close friend of Alexander's. She said that he treated Arias poorly and only used her physically while seeing a string of other women

Friend: But her husband, Chris Hughes, pictured on the witness stand during the trial, said they later fell out with Arias after she eavesdropped on their conversations with Alexander

'You've crossed the line,' one email subject read, and accused the couple of doing 'irreparable damage to mine and Jodi’s 
relationship'.

'She is paranoid that this evil person you have depicted 
will someday surface,' he wrote. 'No matter what I say or do she will always have in
the back of her mind of this person that lurks in the shadows.'

Hughes responded, pointing out that he only called Arias at 1am, 'jokingly calls her a skank' and would only kiss her when other people weren't looking.

'She was being treated horribly, you weren’t beating her physically, but you were emotionally,' she wrote.

'...Know that I would love to see you marry Jodi, but just because you have never seen her cry, doesn't mean she hasn’t been crying. SHE LOVES YOU.'

On trial: Arias is accused of killing Alexander in a fit of jealousy but she says she was acting in self defense

Troubled: The couple dated briefly before breaking up - but continued a sexual relationship

Mrs Hughes also said she told Arias that Alexander was simply using her physically to fulfill him in a way that another woman he was seeing, Deanna Reid, could not.

But the Republic added that the Hugheses ended up falling out with Arias in April 2007 when they caught her eavesdropping on conversations she was having with Alexander on two occasions.

When Arias asked if they would tell Alexander not to date her, Chris Hughes said he responded: 'We want nothing whatsoever to do with you.'

The couple has since spoken out in support of Alexander, claiming that they were manipulated by Arias and that they believed it was 'normal' for their friend to be seeing a string of women.

The trial, which began on January 2, had its final defense witness on Wednesday. Closing arguments are now expected before the case goes to the jury.
