Middlesbrough left back George Friend is interesting West Brom and Crystal Palace.

The 27-year-old has been a consistent performer for Aitor Karanka's side this season.

And his displays have caught the eye of both Tony Pulis and Alan Pardew.

Back in August both Palace and Queens Park Rangers were keen on striking a deal for the defender, but instead Friend penned a new four-year deal at the Riverside Stadium.

QPR have also shown an interest in Friend in this transfer window, but the tight financial situation would provide a stumbling block towards a deal.

The experienced defender has made 110 appearances for Boro since signing from Doncaster Rovers three years ago.
