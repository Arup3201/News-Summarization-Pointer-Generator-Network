Manchester City should consider dropping Yaya Toure and continue using Fernando and Fernandinho as their midfield 'template' for playing in Europe, according to Gary Neville.

The Premier League champions progressed to the last 16 of the Champions League with an organised and disciplined 2-0 defeat of Roma at the Stadio Olimpico - with Samir Nasri and Pablo Zabaleta netting the decisive goals.

As Sportsmail's Jamie Carragher noted 'it wasn't pretty', but it was effective and fellow Sky Sports pundit Gary Neville believes that fielding a more defensive-minded partnership in midfield should be how Manuel Pellegrini sets his side up in the future.

'The two central midfield players (Fernando and Fernandinho) played as a pair. 

'When Yaya Toure plays he's a game changer and a goal scorer, but his defensive play can be easily played around - we've seen that in the Premier League and in European games.

'Tonight for the first time we've seen City play as a pair in midfield. In terms of moving forward that might be a template of how to play in Europe - it's a question for Manuel Pellegrini.' 

'If City play their best Premier League team - that's Aguero and Dzeko up front, Silva and Nasri out wide, and Toure as part of the midfield - you cannot play that way in Europe because Nasri and Silva do not play defensively.

'What Milner and Navas have given them tonight in wide positions is legs to attach themselves to the two in midfield (Fernandinho and Fernando).

David Silva is a creative 'wizard' but does not offer the midfield much protection without the ball

'If you lose the battle in central midfield you will struggle - this is the template city need to use going forward.

'If you play your best players, you don't necessarily play your best team. This should be the template for them moving forward.

'You don't necessarily leave them all out, but you cant fit them all in. If you go away to Barcelona you cant play with Silva, Nasri, Dzeko, Aguero and Toure in the same side.'

Carragher also praised the stability brought to the side by playing the two Brazilians in midfield together. 

'It was an excellent European performance and it comes on the back of a lot of big players missing,' he said.

'Fernando and Fernandinho, those two did a proper job shielding the defence and that is part of the reason City got their first clean sheet from the group stages.'

Manuel Pellegrini should consider playing more cautiously in Europe, especially against the leading teams

Former Liverpool midfielder Graeme Souness agreed that City need to approach European games with more caution.

'It was a really solid euro performance and there's no magic to it. City have been a wee bit too adventurous in the past. Show teams more respect in the early part of games - if it pans out the way you want then leave it, if it doesn't then make changes,' he said.

'Most football people would have seen that and thought that's the way they should have gone in big European games.

'If you field your most attacking side from the first minute then you hand the initiative to the opposition, especially if you go behind,' he added.
