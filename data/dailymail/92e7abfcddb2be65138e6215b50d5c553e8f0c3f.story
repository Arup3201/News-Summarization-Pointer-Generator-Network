Julian Assange’s celebrity backers stood firmly behind their man yesterday despite losing almost £300,000 from his ‘daft’ decision to skip bail.

Supporters of the WikiLeaks founder admitted he gave them no warning that he planned to take refuge in the Ecuadorian Embassy to avoid extradition to Sweden where he faces rape and sexual assault allegations.

He has been holed up in the embassy since June.

On Monday night he was pictured posing there with Lady Gaga, who visited him hours after nine people who acted as bail sureties were ordered by a court to hand over £93,500.

Support: Another group of Assange supporters, including socialite Jemima Khan have also forfeited a security of £200,000

Another group of Assange supporters, including socialite Jemima Khan, journalist John Pilger, film director Ken Loach and publisher Felix Dennis have also forfeited a security of £200,000.

Securities are paid up front to a court whereas sureties are promised funds.

Despite the huge cost, the celebrities continue to support Assange and express fears that if he is extradited to Sweden he will be sent on to the US to face interrogation over the whistle-blowing website, which has published secret military files and diplomatic cables.

Scotland Yard has said it is costing 
£11,000 every day to ensure the Australian does not flee his bolt-hole 
at the embassy in Knightsbridge.

Mr Dennis said: ‘I think what Julian Assange did was absolutely daft, but that’s got nothing to do with it.

‘Julian Assange was going to be put 
into prison ... He committed no crime that we know of. He was not going 
to be given bail. He was going to be put into solitary.

‘I’m not having people put into 
British jails and put into solitary confinement when they’ve been found 
guilty of absolutely nothing, just to please the American government. No
sir, no sir.’

Speaking to BBC Radio 4’s Loose Ends,
he added: ‘Of course I’ve lost my money, but so what? It would have 
been nice if he’d called and told me, but there we are.’

Assange has been granted political asylum by Ecuador but faces arrest if he leaves the embassy after breaking bail conditions.

Vaughan Smith, a friend who is one of
the sureties, said all those who had put up bail had put a ‘huge amount
of effort’ over a long period to support the legal process.

He told Westminster magistrates’ 
court: ‘It is very difficult to see how we could have prevented Mr 
Assange from seeking political asylum in London.

Mr Assange says he did not tell us of
his decision because to do so would have placed us in legal difficulty.
We could not have expected it. Such a thing is unprecedented for a 
surety.’

But he said it would be a ‘public betrayal’ if they urged him to abandon the Ecuadorian Embassy when he had ‘understandable’ fears about his treatment in the United States if he gave up his asylum.

The Chief Magistrate Howard Riddle said he accepted that the sureties had acted in good faith but ruled that each of them had to pay part of the sum originally pledged.

Miss Khan has previously tweeted: ‘I personally would like to see Assange confront the rape allegations in Sweden and the two  women at the centre have a right  to a response.

‘But there is no doubt that Assange has a real fear of being extradited to the US nor that the US gov is out to get WikiLeaks.’
