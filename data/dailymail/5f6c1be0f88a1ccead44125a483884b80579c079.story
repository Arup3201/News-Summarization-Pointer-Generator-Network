Angel di Maria has been right on the money since he joined Manchester United - and on Tuesday he was spotted spending some of his readies at his local supermarket.

The Argentina winger, who joined United for £60million from Real Madrid, got money out at a cashpoint before heading off to buy groceries with a friend.

Things didn't run so smoothly, however, something the graceful star will not be used to.

Di Maria, who is on around £180k a week with at Old Trafford, reportedly took around five minutes to figure out how to use the machine.

While the 26-year-old has been in fine form in recent weeks, his team-mates have let him down somewhat, most notably on Sunday.

United lost 5-3 to Leicester on Sunday, one of the more humiliating defeats in their Premier League history.

And some players put the loss down to the fact that Di Maria, who scored a wonderful chip at the King Power Stadium, was taken off with 14 minutes to go.

One United star was heard to say, 'Why the f*** did we substitute Di Maria?'
