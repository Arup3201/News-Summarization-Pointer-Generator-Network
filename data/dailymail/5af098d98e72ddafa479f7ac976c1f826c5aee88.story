A sharp rise in the number of hospitals missing cancer waiting time targets is putting lives ‘at risk’, a charity warned last night.

Damning figures emerged yesterday which show that the number of NHS trusts missing the main cancer waiting target has tripled in just a year.

The NHS recommends that no one should wait longer than 62 days after being referred urgently by their GP for suspected cancer.

A government target requires that 85 per cent of patients are seen within this time.

But between January and March this year, no fewer than 27 NHS trusts missed the target – up from eight over the same period the year before.

It means that thousands of cancer patients are waiting far too long for potentially life-saving treatment, thanks to a shortage of consultants and MRI scanners.

Separate figures show that the amount of money spent on NHS cancer care has fallen by almost £800million in real terms since the election.

The revelation comes on the day that Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt addresses the Conservative conference in Birmingham.

The Department of Health says the rise is down to the fact that more people are being treated.

But Andy Burnham, Labour’s health spokesman, said: ‘Jeremy Hunt should stand up before the Tory conference today and order an immediate halt to these disgraceful cuts to cancer care.

‘On his watch, people are waiting longer for treatment and tests and now we know why.

‘This is why people can’t trust him and David Cameron with the NHS. He should apologise and produce a plan to bring cancer services back up to the national standard.’

The figures on the number of trusts failing to meet the target were contained in a report published by health regulator Monitor two weeks ago.

It found that: ‘Performance against cancer waiting time targets has steadily deteriorated over the past year.

‘The number of trusts failing the target rose to 27 at Q1 2014/15 compared with 8 at Q1 2013/14.’

The report said the high level of referrals from GPs had led to the decline in performance, but added: ‘When combined with rising emergency demand and elective referrals, a further increase in cancer referrals creates pressure on diagnostic, surgical and inpatient bed capacity.

‘In addition, foundation trusts have also cited late referrals, consultant shortage (especially in urology), complex diagnostic pathways, and inter-trust referral protocols as some of the reasons for breaches.’

Other reasons include ‘inadequate outpatient and diagnostic capacity’.

Figures released following a Parliamentary question show that NHS expenditure on cancer services has fallen in real terms from £5.91billion in 2009/10, the year before the election, to £5.68billion in 2012/13.

It means that in three years since the election, £790million less has been spent on cancer than otherwise would have been spent had pre-election levels been maintained.

Last night Duleep Allirajah, head of policy at Macmillan Cancer Support, said: ‘It is deeply concerning that the number of NHS foundation trusts missing the cancer treatment target have more than trebled in just a year. This is unacceptable.

‘Delays mean that thousands of cancer patients must put their lives on hold while waiting for vital treatment - causing anxiety, distress and putting their lives at serious risk.

‘These delays are yet another clear warning sign that the system isn’t working and the NHS is under huge strain.

‘Everyone should have the best possible chance to survive cancer but lives are being put at risk and this can’t continue. We already have some of the poorest survival rates for cancer in Europe. Macmillan is calling on all the political parties to ensure that cancer remains a top priority ahead of the next general election.’
