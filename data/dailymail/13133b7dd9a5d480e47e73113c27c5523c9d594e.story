A beloved assistant principal was fatally hit by a suspected DUI driver as he jogged on Sunday morning.

Christopher Prewitt, 38, was training for a marathon on South Victoria Avenue in Ventura, California when he was hit about 6.50am.

The driver, 23-year-old Shante Chappell, was allegedly under the influence of drugs when she 'made an unsafe turning movement' while merging and struck Prewitt, KTLA reported.

Chappell, from Oxnard, was arrested on suspicion of vehicular manslaughter and driving under the influence of drugs. She faces court on Friday.

News of the tragic accident has devastated family, friends and colleagues of the adored DeAnza Academy of Technology and Arts assistant principal.

The school's principal, Hector Guerrero, said Prewitt was a dedicated educator who inspired his students.

'I think that we need to focus more on 
who he was as a person, and the legacy heâ€™s leaving behind, and the 
thousands of lives that he has impacted in his time here, in our world,'
 Guerrero told KTLA.

'He
 was a man you could never bring down whatsoever. Positivity was what Chris Prewitt was, and the kids absolutely loved 
that about him. They set up a memorial inside campus today, and one of 
the things they keep saying today is that they miss his wink. He would 
always smile at everyone, and say â€˜have a great dayâ€™.

'I was his principal, he was my assistant principal. But I wanted to be like Chris Prewitt.'

Prewitt, a married father-of-one, lived with a severe hearing loss since birth but never let that stop him from leading a full life.

In 1997, the Ventura man competed with the US team at the World Games for the Deaf.

He was also a water polo coach at Buena High School, turning his disability into an inspiration.

'Chris was an impressive person just 
to begin with and I don't really think it had anything to do with his 
being hearing-impaired,' Ventura Unified School District Assistant 
Superintendent Joe Richards told NBC LA.

'He was just a positive, happy person and he 
approached life that way.

'I will continue to be positive, even in the light of this tragic situation. I think that's what Chris would want.'

An online fundraiser has been set up on YouCaring.com by Prewitt's family to support his wife, Erin Koenig Prewitt, and their young daughter, Isabella.

'You couldn't find a more loving, caring, and selfless couple in the community. They were building an amazing life with their beautiful baby girl, when Chris was abruptly taken away from them,' the family wrote online. 

'Erin is humbly taking donations for two great causes that were very important to Chris. Your support will go towards Izzy's College fund and Schools for Salone.'

More than $16,000 has been donated.

Meanwhile a vigil was held poolside on Monday night at Buena High, where Prewitt trained students.

Former colleague Jena Branstetter told KTLA: 'He was a perfect example of someone that cared about people.'

Former student Julie Blue said: 'You could walk into a room and he could change your mood for the day. He was just always so happy.'

A small, white cross has been erected at the spot where Prewitt died.
