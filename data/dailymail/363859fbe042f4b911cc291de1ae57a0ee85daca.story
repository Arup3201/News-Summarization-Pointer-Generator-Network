Children aged 11 were given a homework sheet on terrorism which asked them to describe 'Palestinian terrorist activities' and posed questions about al-Qaeda and Hamas.

The document was given to pupils at New Stevenston Primary, Motherwell, North Lanarkshire and also included a cartoon image of an explosion. 

Parents spoke of their shock after images of the question sheet were circulated online after it was discovered.  

Pupils in Larnarkshire, aged seven, were given this homework sheet which asks them about terrorism, poses questions about the IRA and Hamas and included a cartoon bomb. The council said it is obsolete

The council claimed the homework sheet is obsolete and was given to pupils by accident. 

It is understood the authority realised it had been distributed in error before children completed any answers on the form.  

Youngsters who received the homework sheet were asked: 'Palestinians feel that they have the RIGHT to use terrorism against the Israelis.

'Give TWO reasons why they feel this. Use the information to help you.

'Describe two examples of Palestinian terrorist activities.'

Beneath the text was a cartoon-like drawing of an explosion.

It asks: 'Which of the following are TWO of the main terrorist groups in Northern Ireland? Al-Qaeda, IRA, HAMAS, UDA.'

It then asks pupils: 'Match the name of LOYALIST or REPUBLICAN to the correct description of the group's aim.

'This group want N.Ireland to remain a part of the UK.

Children receiving the homework sheet were asked to talk about terrorist groups in Northern Ireland 

'This group wants N. Ireland to be united with the rest of Ireland.'

The UDA entered a ceasefire - officially ending its armed campaign in Northern Ireland - in November 2007. The IRA - a name given to numerous separate republican groups - similarly has been on ceasefire since 1997.

The council insisted the sheet was 'obsolete' and said it was making sure all copies were withdrawn from circulation. 

Images of the homework - titled 'Terrorism and Terror - Case Study: Separatists' have appeared online.  

New Stevenston Primary School in Motherwell gave out the homework sheet to its young pupils at the school

The person who posted the image on social media - known as Sher-Locked3 - wrote: 'These are actual homework questions given to children in New Stevenston Primary School as part of their curriculum.

'It's definitely not good, it's factually incorrect and divisive. Anyone with an ounce of intellect knows that.'

Sher-Locked3 added: 'I did not take the picture nor do I have a child at the school.

Which of the following are TWO of the main terrorist groups in Northern Ireland? 

Al-Qaeda, IRA, HAMAS, UDA

Match the name of LOYALIST or REPUBLICAN to the correct description of the group's aim.

'This group want N.Ireland to remain a part of the UK.

'This group wants N. Ireland to be united with the rest of Ireland.' 

'Palestinians feel that they have the RIGHT to use terrorism against the Israelis.

Give TWO reasons why they feel this. Use the information to help you.

Describe two examples of Palestinian terrorist activities.

'This was taken by a person who had a seven year old sibling to whom these questions were given. I verified the picture before posting.'

Ahmed Kadry said it was a 'shocking homework question' and North West Friends of Peace also branded the sheet and nature of the questions 'shocking.' 

A spokesman for North Lanarkshire Council's Learning and Leisure Services said: 'The homework material used was taken from a teaching pack which is now obsolete. We are contacting all schools to ensure this particular material is no longer used.

'The topic is explored by pupils as part of the social studies programme "People, past events and societies" and this includes conflict situations around the world.

'This topic aims to gives pupils a greater understanding of the nature of different conflicts and their regional, global and historical significance and does not pass any judgement on the subject.'
