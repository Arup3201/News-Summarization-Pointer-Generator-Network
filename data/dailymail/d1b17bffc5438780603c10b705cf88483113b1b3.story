Police had to use a woman's satnav to find a child she had left home alone because she was too drunk to give them directions, a court heard yesterday.

Ruth Evans, 41, abandoned the youngster as she joined a drinking session at a pub in High Halden, Kent.

The landlady of the Chequers Inn called police as drunken Evans got out of hand. Officers arrested her when she became aggressive and bared her teeth at them.

As she was being driven into custody Evans revealed she had left a child alone in a house - but could not remember where it was.

They looked up the directions on her satnav and luckily found the child unharmed and asleep on the sofa.

Evans escaped prison yesterday as she admitted cruelty to a child, being in charge of a car while unfit through drink and an assault on the police officer.

Prosecutor Jim Harvey told Canterbury Crown Court how Evans went to the pub last June asking to buy bottles of wine.

She drank a half-pint of shandy and then started to share one of the bottles of wine that she had bought with some customers.

After some time she was told the bar was closing but then become abusive and aggressive.

When she left the pub Evans became confused about where one of the bottles of wine had gone after a friend placed it in her car.

'Under the influence of alcohol': The court heard Evans demanded the police officers stood in a certain place before agreeing to talk to them (file picture)

She then started kicking the pub door to attempt to get back inside and rowing with other bar staff until police were called.

One of the policeman attempted to reason with Evans but had 'no fruitful conversation' with her because she was 'extremely wound up'.

Mr Harvey added: 'The officer formed the view she was under the influence of alcohol. She demanded they stood in a certain place before agreeing to even talk to them.'

It was then that drunken Evans lunged at one of the officers and pushed him forcefully with both her hands while she was 'baring her teeth'.

A second officer then restrained her and arrested her for being drunk and disorderly.

Thomas Restell, defending, said Evans was having treatment for her alcohol problems and her crime.

He said she had faced a number of crises in her life, with 'death after death after death' which was 'enough to wear down even the strongest of people.

Sentencing her to 150 hours of unpaid community work, Judge James O'Mahony told Evans: 'What you did was very serious because you abandoned this child to go off drinking.

'You must surely be thoroughly ashamed of your behaviour that night.

'I accept you have had a pretty miserable time as far as your life is concerned but you can't use your utter drunkenness as some kind of crutch.'
