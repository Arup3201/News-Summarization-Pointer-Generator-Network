Jack Wilshere does not need reminding just how important this season is to his career.

The Arsenal midfielder is painfully aware that, at the age of 22, he must start to deliver on his enormous potential and put the injury-ravaged start to his career behind him.

Ahead of Monday’s Euro 2016 qualifier in Switzerland, Wilshere knows England boss Roy Hodgson is looking to him with expectation after losing Steven Gerrard and Frank Lampard, and is not impressed with what feels like a barrage of criticism from former internationals.

Jack Wilshere’s problem is Jack Wilshere. He’s not performing. He’s got to take games by the scruff of the neck like two years ago — there’s no excuses anymore.

With Steven Gerrard and Frank Lampard coming to the end with England, Jack has an open goal to be our midfield general.

Jack looks like he is lacking confidence. Maybe he has a lack of faith in his body after so many injuries in quick succession. It happens, I know.

Wilshere, like all very good players, has an image in his head of where the next pass is going — that means he is a step ahead.

It started last season with Paul Scholes and resurfaced after Arsenal’s opening game of the season from Sportsmail columnists Jamie Carragher and Jamie Redknapp on Sky Sports. Carragher claimed the brilliant form of Aaron Ramsey was Wilshere’s ‘biggest problem’ but Redknapp said: ‘I think you are being kind. Jack Wilshere is Jack Wilshere’s biggest problem.

‘He is not performing. He has got to do better. He has to take games by the scruff of the neck. There are no excuses for this young man any more. It’s nothing to do with smoking. I played with better players than him who smoked. He has got to do better on the pitch.’

Last season, Scholes said on television that Wilshere had not improved since he was 17. It prompted a call to Scholes for an explanation, then Scholes hit out again at Wilshere for going public about their conversation. ‘With Paul Scholes, we weren’t even playing,’ said Wilshere. ‘I think it was a Manchester United game and he came at me. I spoke openly about it which, obviously, I shouldn’t have.

‘If anything, I think Redknapp should have a little bit more sympathy. He was injured just as much as I was. Maybe more than I was. He was never injured at my age and it does take a lot of mental strength. So to hear people go on TV and say: “He’s got to be doing this or that”. I don’t need that.

‘It disappoints me. It’s easy to go on TV and say: “He’s got to do this or that” or “if he’s not fit, he’s not in the starting line-up and he’s got to get fitter”. That’s the easy way out. I’ll take criticism. I know that’s part and parcel of football. But when it’s just reckless and aggressive, I don’t listen.’

Sportsmail’s Redknapp twice broke his ankle on England duty near the start of his career and later suffered a succession of knee problems, which led to 12 operations, restricted him to 17 caps and ended his career at the age of 31. He has criticised Wilshere, but he has also showered him with praise.

Wilshere was 17 and hailed as the nation’s great midfield hope when he was hit by a series of ankle injuries and tendinitis. It has taken time to get back to the same high levels and his lifestyle has also come under scrutiny.

‘I’ve been caught a couple of times smoking, but I’m not a regular smoker,’ said Wilshere. ‘I spoke with Arsene Wenger after the second time and it was: “Look, come on Jack. This is a big season for you”. I knew that already. When I came back to pre-season training I said I’d be fit and ready to start and I have been.’
