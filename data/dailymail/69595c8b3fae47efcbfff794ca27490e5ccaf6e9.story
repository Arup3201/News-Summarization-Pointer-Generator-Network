A flight attendant is suing octogenarian billionaire real estate developer A. Alfred Taubman for $29 million claiming he fondled her, tried to rip 
off her clothing during flights aboard his private plane and told her she ruined her life by 
getting pregnant and should have had an abortion.

Nicole Rock, 38, filed the complaint on Thursday with the federal court in Detroit, she has accused her former boss, 88, of improper conduct in the roughly six years she worked for the 
married father of three.

Rock, who began working for Taubman's 
company as a flight attendant in March 2005, alleged her civil rights 
were violated by the Taubman Air Terminals Inc. president and chief 
executive and his company because she was 'forced to endure horrific 
illegal acts by defendants of a graphic and sexually harassing nature.'

Unmarried flight attendant Rock claims she was 'subjected to repeated comments, innuendos, advances, and other offensive conduct of a sexual nature' by Taubman

Nicole Rock filed her complaint on Thursday in which she accused her former boss of improper conduct

In her complaint, the unmarried flight attendant claims Taubman 
grabbed her or brushed against her on multiple occasions, forced his 
tongue into her ear and mouth repeatedly, ripped buttons off her 
blouse, and once tried to perform oral sex on her.

According to the complaint, Rock was awarded disability leave in February 2011 because of the 'extreme stress, anxiety, fearfulness and depression' she experienced as a result of her work conditions. She left Taubman's employ for good that month.

The filing alleges 'during a flight, (Taubman) forced his hands down the front of (Rock's) dress and proceeded to forcefully kiss her on the mouth without her consent … Taubman violently tore buttons off of (Rock's) blouse.'

Rock alleges she repeatedly asked Taubman to stop, telling him: 'You're hurting me,' and asking 'Are you crazy?' and 'Why don't you hire a prostitute?'

Rock also claims Taubman 'became very angry' and told her she 'should have gotten an abortion' when she informed him she was pregnant in December 2009.

'The allegations contained in the 
complaint filed in court against A. Alfred Taubman are not true,' 
Taubman's office said in a statement. 'Mr. Taubman will address the 
complaint through the appropriate legal channels.'

Nicole Rock worked as a flight attendant for Taubman Air Terminals Inc. for six years

Rock's attorney Thomas Warnicke said his client isn't currently working and has been left devastated by the whole affair

Rock's attorney, Thomas Warnicke told The Detroit News that his client isn't working. 'This has been emotionally devastating for her,' he said.

Shortly after informing her boss she was pregnant, Rock went on a company-approved disability leave, the lawsuit says.

Rock gave birth in February 2010 and was allegedly forced to return to work in March, rather than April as she had planned.

Immediately after her return, Rock says Taubman engaged in harassing behavior about her decision to have the baby. Rock sought and received a second short-term disability leave in February 2011, the filing says. Taubman's 'severe' conduct resulted in her forced resignation on Feb. 13, 2011.

Rock last year sued her daughter's father, Steven Widman of Waterford, chief pilot for Taubman Air Terminals, for $1,432 per month in child support.

The $29 million is one percent of Taubman's net worth of $2.9 billion, as estimated by Forbes magazine in September.

Taubman lives in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan, and started the mall empire Taubman Centers Inc in 1950.

He is a prominent philanthropist, who has contributed millions to support the Detroit Institute of Art and the University of Michigan.

In
2002 and 2003 he served roughly nine months in prison over an art 
auction price-fixing scandal at Sotheby's, which he bought in 1983. He 
no longer has a controlling stake.

Taubman has been married twice. In 1948 he wed his college sweetheart
Reva Kolodney, but they divorced in 1977. Then in 1982 he married Judith Mazor
Rounick, a former Miss Israel in 1962. He has three adult children Gayle,
Robert and William who work within his business empire. 

Taubman is regarded as a 'legend in retailing' who made his fortune pioneering the concept of the shopping mall
