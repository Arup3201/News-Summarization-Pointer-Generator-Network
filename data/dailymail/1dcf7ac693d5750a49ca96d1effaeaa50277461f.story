Greater Manchester Police bosses have scrapped plans to axe 25 firearms officers following the terror attack in Paris.

Senior officers met within hours of the massacre at the offices of French magazine Charlie Hebdo on Wednesday where a dozen people, including two police officers, were killed.

The two masked gunmen, armed with assault rifles, had forced their way into the building on Wednesday, shooting dead the editor Stephane Charbonnier, his police guard and nine other members of staff. As they fled in a waiting black car, they opened fire at police and shot dead an officer in the street.

Senior GMP figures insist no decisions have yet been made but it is understood they have done a u-turn over plans to lose 25 posts from the force's firearms unit and 50 officers from its traffic division.

The decision also follows a warning by the director-general of MI5, Andrew Parker, who said Al Qaeda were planning 'mass casualty attacks' against the West.

The UK terror threat is currently rated as 'severe' which means the security forces believe an attack is highly likely.

Mr Parker said: ‘Although we and our partners try our utmost, we know that we cannot hope to stop everything.'

'We still face more complex and ambitious plots that follow the now sadly well-established approach of Al Qaeda and its imitators – attempts to cause large-scale loss of life, often by attacking transport systems or iconic targets.

‘We know, for example, that a group of core Al Qaeda terrorists in Syria is planning mass casualty attacks against the West.’ 

He added that the number of 'crude' attacks had gone up and admitted it was 'almost inevitable' an attack in Britain would succeed sooner or later.  

Although there is no specific intelligence of an attack in Manchester, police bosses in the city are anxious about an increase in the 'heat' being picked up from Islamic fundamentalists.  

Officers have been warned to be on their guard as it is feared police officers themselves could be the target for the next terror attack.

The plans to axe police marksmen and traffic officers emerged during a review into all departments which started six months ago.

The government has ordered force bosses to slash £154m from its annual budget by 2017 on top of previous cuts worth £134m.

Deputy Chief Constable Ian Hopkins told the MEN: 'Greater Manchester Police have been reviewing all areas of business to cope with the level of cuts imposed upon us. As such, no areas of the organisation have been untouched in terms of considering where to make savings.

The massacre, which left twelve people dead, including two police officers, ended with the men running off, sparking a massive manhunt

'No formal papers have yet been considered regarding firearms and traffic roles.

'However, what is clear is that in future we will have to make very difficult decisions around how we use the budget we are allocated taking into account the threats and risks of policing an area as diverse as Greater Manchester.'

Asked whether he would reconsider cuts to policing budgets in the light of the Paris shooting, Prime Minister David Cameron told the MEN: 'Yes we have had to reduce policing budgets - we've done that by some 20pc. 

'What's happened though is the percentage of police on the frontline has gone up, satisfaction with police has gone up, and crucially crime has come down.

'Crucially in Greater Manchester crime has come down by 20pc over the past four years. It's a good example of where when you're faced with difficult long term decisions, if you take them in the right way you can produce a better service for less money.

'It's very important Manchester's police force think through the changes they make very carefully. We have been putting more money into counter terror policing in recent weeks in response to what happened in Woolwich.'

People around the world have come out in support of the victims of the massacre with services in countries across the globe. 

Yesterday, France held a minute's silence will be observed at midday across the country and the bells of Notre Dame Cathedral in the capital tolled for the two policemen and ten others, mainly magazine staff, who were murdered.

Seven people have been arrested over the Charlie Hebdo massacre, but the two 'armed and dangerous' brothers with links to terrorist groups going back at least a decade, have not yet been caught.

Cherif and Said Kouachi were today exchanging fire with police as they held hostages on an industrial estate near a Paris airport.

At least two people are thought to have been killed and several wounded before Cherif and Said Kouachi entered business premises in the village of Dammartin-en-Goele, north-east of the capital.

However, the public prosecutor has deny reports there had been casualties.

The gunmen are believed to have taken one hostage with them into a storage unit, which is now surrounded by police commandos who have begun negotiations to try to secure their release.
