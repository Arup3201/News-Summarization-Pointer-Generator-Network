A Swiss politician has been accused of advertising for cannibals to kill and eat the mother and daughter of a policeman friend going through a ‘tricky’ divorce.

Hans Ulrich Rudel, a convicted murderer, allegedly sought a ‘sadistic master or butcher who can educate us mindless creatures.’

Rudel, 53, is said to have placed the German language ad in the names of his best friend's wife, Patricia Joachim, 27, and her 12-year-old daughter.

It added: ‘We are keen to meet gentlemen interested in slaughter and dolce who would like to roast us on a spit.’ 

Rudel, a founder of a local 
conservative party, later told police that ‘dolce’ – the Italian word 
for ‘sweet’ - was his term for cannibalism.

Previously,
he had served a decade in jail for the ritualistic killing of a young 
woman in 1988 - he shot her and then impaled her body on a tree branch.

Both
he and Joachim – his co-founder of a branch of the Swiss conservative 
party BDP in Embrachertal - were members of a sado-masochistic club.

Rudel,
who worked in the town planning office, was known as ‘Marquis el 
Diablo’ who specialised in spanking, whippings and ‘hot wax’ torture.

Rudel,
who goes on trial tomorrow, told police after his arrest in 2010 that 
he posted the ad in the hope that someone ‘would get the wife out of the
way.’

Hiding sinster activity? The Swiss town Embrach, where Hans Ulrich Rudel is accused of advertising for a 'master butcher' to cannibalise two women

‘I was hoping Patricia would be picked up by a butcher and never show up again,’ he said. 

He added that she would ‘play along’ with the sadomasochistic game that would ultimately result in her death. 

Some two dozen people responded to the small ad on the Internet, one offering a ‘special dungeon’ on his farm that he could use.

Another described himself as an ‘ideal and very experienced master butcher.’  

Rudel chose him for his macabre scheme and replied, enclosing photos of the would-be victims.

But the master butcher turned out to be an undercover policeman.

Rudel was then arrested and charged with incitement to murder.

Joachim spent several weeks inside but was freed after police said he had no idea about the murder plot.

Echo: German computer expert Armin Meiwes killed and ate killed and willing victim Bernd-Juergen Brandes in 2000 after adverting for someone to eat

The case has exposed once more the seedy underworld of cannibal fantasists in Europe that was first laid bare in the 2003 trial of German cannibal killer Armin Meiwes who lured a Berlin computer programmer to his home near Kassel, Germany, where he killed and ate him.

Meiwes revealed at his trial that he got dozens of replies to his advert seeking someone to eat.  

‘There are a lot of cannibals out there,’ he said before being sentenced.
