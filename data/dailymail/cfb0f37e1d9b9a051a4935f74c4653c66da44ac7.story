A ten-year-old boy has been given a new ear by doctors who built the organ from scratch using one of his ribs.

Alfie Hazell was born with an ear lobe but no ear structure or canal on his left side. 

This was due to him suffering hemifacial microsomia - a congenital disorder that 
affects the development of the lower half of the face, most commonly the
ears and mouth.

Alfie Hazell, 10, was given a new left ear (pictured) by surgeons at Great Ormond Street Hospital who made it out of one of his ribs. They used skin grafts to cover the new ear structure

It can occur on just one side of the face or one both and can cause problems with breathing. It is the second most common facial birth defect after clefts.

Now, surgeons at Great Ormond Street Hospital have built Alfie a brand new ear.

His mother, Catherine, 41, said the amazing procedure has transformed her son’s life.

She said: ‘Alfie has been so brave, and we’re so proud of him. The new ear means that Alfie won’t have to deal with people staring any more.

Alfie was born with hemifacial microsomia - a congenital disorder that affects the development of the lower half of the face. It meant he had a left ear lobe but no outer ear or ear canal

'He has coped 
with people making comments about his appearance all his life. Ever 
since he was small he hid behind our legs when he met new people, and 
always hid his left side. 

‘When he was three, a group of older boys surrounded us while we were on a train and pointed and laughed at him.

‘Even
though he was very young, the experience affected Alfie for years 
afterwards, it was deeply traumatic and really set his confidence back a
long way.

‘When Alfie
was five, a girl told him his appearance made her feel sick. Those are 
the sorts of reactions that he had to get used to. He had to do a lot of
growing up in a short space of time.

Alfie (pictured as a baby) was told he had to wait until he was nine-years-old before he could have the procedure as his ribs needed to mature sufficiently

Alfie's mother, Catherine (pictured with Alfie and his brothers, Joseph and Toby), said: 'Alfie has been so brave, and we're so proud of him. The new ear means that Alfie won't have to deal with people staring any more'

Mrs Hazell, a 
childminder, and her husband Ben, 40, a business development manager, 
were keen to give Alfie the power to decide the course of his 
life-changing treatment.

Doctors
had advised the family, of Harpenden, Hertfordshire, that Alfie needed 
to wait until he was nine-years-old before they could operate to allow 
enough time for his ribcage to develop.

‘Some people with Alfie’s condition 
choose not to have reconstructive surgery. The staff at Great Ormond 
Street said our options were to do nothing, to fit a prosthetic or to 
have a rib graft.

Alfie was too scared to look at his new ear until he was in the car going home from the hospital

He had to have a skin graft taken from his head (pictured) to cover and support the new ear

‘I 
was keen that Alfie was able to make the decision himself. Ben and I 
encouraged him to speak to consultants directly during appointments, as 
if he was one of the adults.’

In April 2011, Alfie decided that he wanted to go ahead with the rib graft procedure which would involve two operations.

The first operation, which involved putting the newly shaped rib bone into place, was carried out a year later.

The
procedure involved a section of bone and cartilage from one of Alfie’s 
ribs being used to build the missing ear structure. Skin grafts were 
then applied to cover the bone.

Alfie was so happy when he first saw his new ear that he took a photo of it on his phone and sent it to all of his friends and family

Alfie
has been deaf on his left side since birth and although the new ear 
does not allow him to hear, he will have the option to implant a hearing aid later in life. 

Then, in March 2013, the final procedure to fill out the ear structure using skin grafts was successfully completed.

Mrs Hazell said: ‘When they took the bandage off, Alfie was so nervous that he didn’t want to look at the left side of his face at first. 

‘It
was only when we were in the car going home from the hospital that he 
felt brave enough to take a picture of his new ear and look at it.

‘He was so happy when he saw what it looked like - he sent pictures to everyone to show off.’

It is possible that Alfie will require further surgery in the future to correct the alignment of his jaw and teeth.

Mr and Mrs Hazell have been given support throughout Alfie’s journey by charities Changing Faces and Microtia Mingle.

Alfie’s brothers, five-year-old Joseph, and Toby, nine, have been drafted in to look out for their big brother through the lengthy healing process.

Mrs Hazell said: ‘We had to explain to the boys that they need to be careful during rough-and-tumble games. If Alfie damages his ear there could be an infection or it might need to be rebuilt, so we have to be careful.

‘He’s also had to sit out of PE at school, but he’s been very understanding about the situation.’

Hemifacial microsomia is the second most common facial birth defect after clefts.

Children with the condition have a small or underdeveloped part of the face - usually the ear or jaw.

The underdevelopment of the face can lead to feeding, speech and breathing problems.

The condition can also result in hearing and sight loss.

It is not known what causes it but it is believed to develop in the early stages of pregnancy.

It is not clear exactly how many people the condition affects but it could be as many as one in 5,600.

It is more common in men than women.
