It was an outstanding performance from the United States, inspired by Tim Howard, but it could not prevent American hearts being broken as Belgium finally produced a performance to match their pre-World Cup billing.

Howard - who made 15 saves - defied Belgium until extra time, when the introduction of Romelu Lukaku - his Everton team-mate last season - proved decisive with the striker creating the opening for Kevin de Bruyne's winner before scoring the second himself in a thrilling 2-1 victory.

Belgium, who had failed to inspire in their group games, have the reward of a quarter-final against Argentina in Brasilia.
