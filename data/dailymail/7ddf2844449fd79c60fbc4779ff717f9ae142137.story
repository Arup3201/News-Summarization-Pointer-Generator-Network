A Bangladeshi MP filmed naked with a woman in his office was forced to undress at gunpoint by a gang to blackmail him, police claimed on Monday.

The group used the lewd footage to extort five million Bangladeshi Taka (£38,887) from the man.

Assistant police commissioner Abdul Ahad said officers had arrested five people, including three women, on charges of blackmailing the MP who is allied with the government.

MP blackmailed: The MP Abdul Jabbar who represented the Jatiya Party at the Dhaka national parliament building (pictured) was blackmailed for 5 million Bangladeshi Taka (£38,887)

Mr Ahad said: ‘They ordered him to strip.

‘One female blackmailer became nude and the others forced the MP to make a video with her.’

The incident took place in the capital Dhaka in May and the gang allegedly demanded the money from the MP, identified as Abdul Jabbar by the local media, or threatened to release the film on the internet.

Mr Ahad said: ‘The lawmaker gave them 1.8 million Taka (£14,000) immediately.’

After watching the video ‘it was evident’ that the MP was forced to act at gunpoint, Mr Ahad said.

He also denied there had been any sexual contact between Mr Jabbar and the naked woman.

The parliamentarian from the Jatiya Party, an ally of the government, told Bengali daily Prothom Alo that the alleged criminals had gained access to his office by saying that he needed to sign some papers.
