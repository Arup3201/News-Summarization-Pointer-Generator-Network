The boyfriend of the mother of missing Florida teen, Alexandria Chery, has been arrested and charged with destroying evidence and lying to the police investigating her disappearance.

Sanel Saint Simon, 43, has been taken into custody in relation to the missing 16-year-old who was last seen by her mother at 7am on Monday outside their home in Orlando.

Deputies investigating her disappearance have said that they found blood traces splattered on the walls of the teens bedroom and on a stuffed animal there.

Investigators allege that Simon tried to clean up the scene with bleach and has been charged with providing false information to a law enforcement officer and attempted destruction of evidence according to the Orlando Sentinel.

Orange County Sheriff Jerry Demings has described the disappearance of Chery as 'extremely suspicious'.

Deputies are interviewing Simon about his whereabouts between 10am and 3pm on Monday.

He has told them he went to work at Boston Market at around 7am but left and did not clock out around 9.30am according to records.

Tests: Police are testing this car, which belongs to Sanel Saint Simon for any evidence which could lead them to Alexandria Chery

However, according to deputies, Simon had originally told investigators that he was at work throughout the day.

He later took this back and claimed he had stayed at a nearby mall until Chery's mother picked him up.

Orange County Sheriff's office has said that concern is high for Chery's well-being because it is unusual for her not to contact her family.

Anyone with information about Alexandria's whereabouts is asked to call the Sheriff's Office at 407-836-HELP407-836-HELP.
