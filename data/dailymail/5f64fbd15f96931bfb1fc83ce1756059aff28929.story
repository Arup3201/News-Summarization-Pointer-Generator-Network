 

David Cameron has been urged to confront French President Francois Hollande over claims the country is funding ISIS terrorists by paying ransoms to free hostages.

Britain and the United States refuse to negotiate with terrorists in an effort not to encourage further hostage taking. But this policy is being undermined by European countries negotiating secret deals to free their citizens.

Over the last five years Islamic State - also known as ISIS or ISIL - is thought to have earned £75million ransoming more than 50 captives. Kidnapping Europeans has become the main source of revenue for Al Qaeda and its spin off – the Islamic State.

US airstrikes slowed the militants' march on Kurdish forces in the north of Iraq, and have helped government forces retake Mosul dam, but ISIS continues to win battles over the border in Syria.

Four French and three Spanish hostages have been released this year after money was delivered through an intermediary, the New York Times reported today.

Fears have been raised that European countries’ policy of secretly negotiating with terrorists is undermining the West’s response to the growing threat from ISIS.

Tory MP Andrew Rosindall, who sits on the respected Foreign Affairs Select Committee, said: ‘If they are paying ransoms they are harming the interests of the free world and by playing the game of terrorism by paying ransom money they are funding and furthering the cause of ISIS and Al Qaeda.

‘The French and the Spanish should really look at themselves in the mirror and ask whether this is the right thing to do.’

‘I think Parliament will be angry – and the British people will be angry. Once again it’s left to Britain and America to stand firm while other countries wobble.

‘The Prime Minister should be raising this with President Hollande. The French are undermining all of us by doing this.’

A Foreign Office source admitted it was a concern for the Government. ‘It is definitely an issue,’ the source said.

‘All you can do is emphasise what we do and why we think it is right. A lot of countries won’t talk about it. Some countries will say one thing and another thing happens.’

But a former senior Cabinet minister told MailOnline that there was no point ‘tweaking the French tail’ because the UK would not get anywhere.

ISIS is making money from hostage ransoms and a black market trade in oil, while also recruiting thousands of fighters from across the globe - including at least 500 from Britain - using videos like this one released in July

He added: ‘They don’t admit it. It comes out through what other people say. When you see a French President on the tarmac greeting a freed hostage you can be fairly sure they paid.’

Militants are now thought to hold more than 20 captives, mostly aid workers, journalists and photographers who they are ransoming in order to raise funds.

In the past week ISIS forces have also seized 12 villages to the north of Aleppo in Syria as they battle government forces to take control of the country's largest city.

Two Italian women, a Dane and a Japanese national were seized near Aleppo yesterday, according to The Guardian. It is thought they will be taken to their stronghold of Raqqa, before the group issues ransom demands.

Three other American citizens, including journalists Austin Tice, US, and Steven Sotloff, are still thought to be held captive by ISIS.

The Arabic Al Hayat newspaper also reported that a former Islamic State prisoner saw his jailers demanding $100,000 apiece for freeing two ethnic Armenians held in a prison in northeastern Syria.

According to a statement by the US Treasury in June, ransom payments are now the second largest source of income for terrorist groups, after state sponsorship.

The fanatical group had also demanded $132million to release journalist James Foley before he was executed, but the request was rejected as the US does not negotiate with terrorists.

As well as money, the terror group had also requested the release of Aafia Siddiqui, an M.I.T. graduate and Pakistani neuroscientist with ties to Al Qaeda currently locked up in Texas.

Recent estimates have put ISIS's income at around $1million a month, but in July experts revealed the group are sitting on oil reserves that could bring in around $1million a day.

The jihadists are thought to be smuggling barrels of unrefined crude oil into Turkey and Iran where they offer it up for $25 (£15) a barrel, making a huge profit.

Industry experts believe the fighters are taking the oil from plains south of Mosul and transporting it in tankers, owned by the extremists, so it can be turned into diesel and petrol.

A major recruitment drive in July across social media networks such as Twitter also saw ISIS bolster its forces with thousands of fighters drawn from across the globe.

At least 500 Britons are thought to have joined the group, thanks in part to an English-language recruitment video featuring , Reyaad Khan, Abu Muthana Al Yemeni and Abu Bara' Al Hindi.

However, Birmingham MP Khalid Mahmood has since put the number of British recruits at 1,500.

Last month, fighters overran the Division 17 military base in Raqqa, killing at least 85 soldiers, while two weeks later the extremists seized the nearby Brigade 93 base after days of heavy fighting.

In recent days Islamic State soldiers also seized 12 villages near the base, which contains several warplane squadrons, helicopters, tanks, artillery and ammunition.

Masrour Barzani, chancellor of the Kurdish region security council, said that ISIS soldiers are using five divisions worth of US-supplied Iraqi weapons to outgun their opponents.

Since July, Islamic State fighters have methodically picked off isolated government bases in northern and eastern Syria, killing and decapitating army commanders and pro-government militiamen.

Yesterday there were reports of fierce clashes around the facility accompanied by government airstrikes in which at least six fighters were killed.
