A ballet dancer is on target to waltz his way to fame with a series of gravity-defying photographs which could well be the ultimate self portraits.

Tourists wandering through the cobbled streets of Paris would stand in awe as they saw Mickael Jou performing his dance routines ranging from ballet to more modern moves.

Snapping away with their cameras as Mickael performed pirouettes through the air, old and young alike would then share their magical pictures with the dancer.

Mickael, who now lives in Berlin, said seeing the snaps inspired him to start his own project, enabling him to marry his love of dance with photography using a variety of locations as a backdrop.

'Tourists would quite often photograph and film me dancing in Paris, and after seeing the pictures they'd taken of me, I figured that I should try it out for myself,' said Mickael.

After wandering around the Louvre art gallery in Paris for inspiration, Mickael bought a camera of his own and pored over the manual until he knew exactly how to use all the features and time his dance moves to coincide with the shutter speed.

Over the past three years,he has collected an assortment of snaps which show him dancing through the air for his 365 photo project.

I’ve spent  three years working on this 365 photo project and it will probably take  another three years to finish it,' he added.

Uploading the photographs onto his website, viewers will be able to see  Mickael almost floating through the air on a beach, beside a hotel and in woodland.

The 30-year-old said he puts a lot of thought into the location of his photographs with some of the snaps taking minutes to shoot and others much longer.

'I pick out a location, and then I set-up my tripod and I have a remote control that I press,' he said.

'Of course, I also adjust photographic settings such as the aperture, but the tripod and the remote control is how I manage to photograph myself. 

'Taking a picture can take anywhere from five minutes to an hour. 

Sometimes I get lucky and have lots of time to take a picture, but sometimes I have constraints and no time at all, for instance if the sunlight changes or the other people in the picture can't stay.'

Mickael said that while it looks like there is  just him at a particular spot, there is usually a throng of people behind the camera. 

'Passers-by often stop and ask what I'm doing or even take pictures of me taking pictures of myself,' said Mickael.

'I've had groups of 50 people cheer me on as I take a picture, which kind of feels like a sports match, but with dancing!'

Mickael said that while the self-portraits are a hobby, he does occasionally sell them as well.

'Eleven of my pictures are currently hanging up at a bar in Berlin, the Mokkabar, Gneisenaustraße 93,' he said.

'This project is very personal to me, but I'm always glad if people enjoy my pictures.

I used to work in marketing in Paris, but now I'm based in Berlin and working as a photographer's assistant to get some more experience. 

'I began dancing when I was 18 and I actually like anything to do with exercise and will do stretching most days.'

Mickael, who said his dream job would be to work as a fashion or commercial photographer, said children watching him dancing and taking photographs often tried to copy him.

'When I'm doing the splits, I often see little children trying to do them as well - it's really cute,' he added.
