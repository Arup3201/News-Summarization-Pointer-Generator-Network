The controversial 'naked' strip worn by the Colombian women's cycling team has been branded 'unacceptable' by the International Cycling Union president Brian Cookson.

Photographs of the Bogota Humana team were taken at the Tour of Tuscany, showing six women wearing red and yellow kit with flesh-coloured material immediately above and below the waist.

Cookson was compelled to speak out about the kit, and said:  'To the many who have raised the issue of a certain women's team kit, we are on the case.

'It is unacceptable by any standards of decency'.

Nicole Cooke, the Welsh former Commonwealth, Olympic and world road race champion, also had her say on the stunt.

She said: 'This has turned the sport into a joke. Girls stand up for yourselves - say no.'
