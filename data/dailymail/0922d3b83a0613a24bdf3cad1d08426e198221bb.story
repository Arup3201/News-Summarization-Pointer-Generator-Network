A condo in Michigan has become so overrun with the junk and filth left by its hoarder owners that neighbors in adjoining units have had to pick and move thanks to vermin spilling over into their homes.

The unit in the Wingate Condominium Complex has already been condemned by the Ypsilanti Township and one neighbor sick of the roaches, mice and fleas settling in her home has moved out.

Another neighbor says she'll soon do the same as the condo association and even the town itself band together to sue the homeowner, who's been MIA for a month.

Hoard: Trash, clothes and collectible cars are piled to the point of blocking walkways and windows in an Ypsilanti Township, Michigan condo

Filthy: Roaches crawl the walls in the condo (left) that was so filthy for so long that vermin began taking up residents in adjoining units, and forcing neighbors out

Piled up: A man lived in the home in Ypsilanti Township, Michigan along with his daughter and grandchild

'I’m kind of in the same boat as (the 
neighbor who moved),' Stacie Vinson told MLive. 'It’s a nuisance, a 
headache, it’s embarrassing and there’s a stigma to it.'

Photos from from several visits to the home over the course of years show the floors, countertops and virtually all surfaces covered in progressively more trash, food waste and household items.

Roaches crawl up the walls and at least six chihuahuas roamed the filthy floors, adding their feces to the mess.

Officials at the time showed up because a baby was living in the home in the unsanitary conditions.

The area humane society also joined the fray because of the dogs.

According to MLive.com, a subsequent court order barred the homeowners from keeping pets from there on.

Unassuming: 'They¿re always really nice,' said future ex-neighbor Stacie Vinson. 'You never would know what was going on if you saw them'

Litigation: The mess is so bad that the city and condo association have filed suit against the owners of the unit

Piles of filth: Nearly every surface in the home is covered in trash and forgotten items

Dangerous: Trash strewn about the house not only sent neighbors packing thanks to the vermin, but has officials concerned about the potential to start a massive house fire

In the latest inspection, a child was living in the home along with its mother and grandfather. Two dogs were found in the home.

After the most recent inspection, a Washtenaw County judge gave the owners 10 days to rectify the situation.

'The infestation did affect the entire building,' said township building director Ron Fulton. 'The owners say they are going remove everything and scrub the bare walls and floors.'

Fit for a baby? Officials visited the home in 2011 to address an infant living there in unsanitary conditions

At least six chihuahuas were found in the home during the February 2011 visit and a judge told the owners they could no longer keep pets

Feces was found all over the floors from the dogs

It's not known what became of the dogs that were taken from the home in 2011, but two dogs were found during last month's visit

The township and condo association have joined litigation against the homeowners, who've not been seen at the property since last month, despite the judge's order to get it clean.

Meanwhile, the current neighbors just want things to be normal again and stayed positive, even when talking about the nuisance neighbors.

'I would love to stay. This has been the only issue,' Vinson said.

And of the hoarder owners: 'They’re always really nice,' she said of the condo owners. 'You never would know what was going on if you saw them.'

It's clear from the pictures from subsequent visits that little ever changed inside the home
