It may have only been an Under 21 fixture against Ipswich but West Ham produced a goal which could have graced any stage. 

It was not so much the finish from Diafra Sakho itself that was impressive, more the superb one-touch interplay between Alex Song and Ravel Morrison that preceded it.

Song, who joined the Hammers on deadline day from Barcelona, showed his superior skills with an array of tricks and flicks, at one point even bringing out a cheeky Rabona.  

Tiki-taka touch: Alex Song produces a sublime flick to get the move started

Superb stuff: Song and Ravel Morrison combine magnificently as the Hammers get into the box

Connection: The two Hammers midfielders show they can read each other's play in the build-up

Slick: West Ham manage to slice through the Ipswich defence with ease to set up a superb goal

Finish: Diafra Sakho is handed the ball on a plate and duly scores from close range

And his tiki-taka touches clearly spurred Morrison into action, as he linked with his team-mate and stretched for a volley to set up Sakho.

And it moved West Ham co-owner David Gold to post a video link to the goal on Twitter with the message: 'Diafra Sakho scored a stunning goal in our 5-1 win against an Ipswich XI yesterday. Well worth watching dg'.

Song has signed for West Ham on a season-long loan deal and will be looking to make his debut once he achieves match fitness.

And if he produces skill like that in the first-team, he could help counter the accusations of negativity which dog manager Sam Allardyce's style of play. 

And Song could also be the player who finally inspires Morrison to fulfil his undoubted potential. 

Matthias Fanimo scored four as the Hammers put on an impressive display against Ipswich - but even that feat could not upstage the superb team goal.
