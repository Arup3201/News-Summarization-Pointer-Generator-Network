A real-life superhero mask that can boost the vision and hearing of its wearer has been revealed.

Created by students at the Royal College of Art, the masks contain sensors to augment the person's sight and hearing.

The team behind the real-life 'iron man' mask hope it could be produced to help sports stars improve their game and in art projects.

The mask can show wearer's 'track' of movement, allowing golfers to easily see how their swing can be improved, for instance, in a similar effect to long exposure photography

The audio part of the mask lets people 'zoom in' on speech nearby, neutralising background noise using built-in speakers and microphones.

The researchers have created too headsets to improve our senses:

Eidos Vision 'enhances the way we see motion, achieving a similar effect 
to long exposure photography for live experience,' the researchers say.

'By detecting and 
overlaying movement, it allows us to see traces and patterns hidden to 
the naked eye.'

Eidos Audio 'lets us hear speech more selectively.

'It neutralizes 
distracting background noise and then amplifies the speech you choose.

'It uses the principle of bone conduction that creates the unique 
experience of hearing someone speak right inside your head.'

There are two masks at present, one improving hearing and one for vision.

The face mask component has the ability to isolate sounds in a crowd and target people to listen in.

The researchers say this could be developed as a hearing aid, or even help ADHD sufferers.

'Eidos has healthcare benefits where it can be used to boost sensory signals weakened by aging or disability.

'For example, it can help sufferers of ADHD who commonly find it difficult to concentrate in noisy and distracting environments.

'Eidos lets them focus on the speech or conversation they really need to, providing an alternative to drugs such as Ritalin.'

The visor component has an embedded camera that transmits visual data to a computer and sends it back to the visor, which then displays the video information with enhancements that help the viewer detect patterns of movement, rather like a timelapse photograph.

'We are a multidisciplinary team of Masters students at the Royal College of Art and Imperial College London studying Innovation Design Engineering,' said Tim Bouckley, who took part in the project with Millie Clive-Smith, Mi Eun Kim and Yuta Sugawara.

'The devices were designed to showcase our technologies, but they do work.

'In the future we will be refining the technologies to make them wireless and focusing on specific applications were were can productize our technologies.

'The most promising directions currently are in sports analysis and arts performance.

'We are also interested in the health applications of our bone-conduction technology, especially for the hearing impaired.

The mask looks similar to the one worn by Robert Downey in the Iron Man series of films

'However testing it difficult as there is much greater regulation in the healthcare industry, meaning that this is a longer term goal for Eidos.'

The team say they wanted to 'improve human experience' with the project.

'On the one hand we were concerned with how to improve or even radically change everyday human experience, and on the other we were fascinated by technology and todayâ€™s products that give us ever greater control over the world around us,' they said.

The team showed off the designs at the London College of Art earlier this year - and hope it could now become a real product

The mask could potentially be used to help athletes such as golfers improve their swing

The team created dozens of 'superhero' mask prototypes before finalising their design

Although they work, the versions of the mask shown here are early prototypes
