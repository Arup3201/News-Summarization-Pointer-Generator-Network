Paula Deen is scheduled to appear on the Today Show Wednesday, less than a week after she cancelled an interview amid the scandal over her use of racial slurs.

Following her dismissal from the Food Network, meat producer Smithfield announced that they will be dropping Deen as their company spokeswoman and will be ending their partnership. The company also sells a line of Paula Deen-branded hams. 

The company released a statement saying it 'condemns the use of offensive and discriminatory language and behavior of any kind. Therefore, we are terminating our partnership with Paula Deen.'

Shilling no more: Paula Deen had long served as the spokeswoman for Smithfield hams, and even had her own brand of ham, but now they have sacked her over the racial slur scandal

Try again: The show announced the the disgraced chef would be appearing on Wednesday

Awkward: Lauer was forced to explain on-air that Deen was meant to show up on Friday but simply didn't come

The Food Network had featured the butter-loving chef on their cable channel since 2001 but they were the first ones to drop her as soon as the extent of her racist language became clear.

Home shopping network QVC issued a carefully-worded statement saying they do not tolerate discrimination, but were reticent to drop Deen until the litigation was finalized. They sell a line of cookware designed by the 66-year-old TV chef.

On Monday, meat producer Smithfield announced that they would be cutting ties with Deen in light of the scandal.

It is unclear how much she earned from her multi-year contract with the meat firm, but she is estimated to have a net worth of $17million.

Another blow came when it was announced over the weekend that she will not be appearing on home shopping network QVC as litigation continues in the discrimination lawsuit.

The
66-year-old cook became embroiled in the racial controversy when a 
former employee testified that she heard Deen repeatedly use the n-word 
and talk of how she wanted to have a plantation themed wedding for her 
brother with an all-black serving staff to emulate slaves.

After the testimony was released 
publicly, both Deen and her career have spiraled out of control in a 
public relations nightmare.

First she released a heavily-edited video on Friday where she spoke directly to her fans, asking for their forgiveness.

She was due to follow that up with an appearance on the Today Show that same morning, but cancelled at the last minute leaving co-anchor Matt Lauer to explain on air.

After the initial video was released another, longer one was then posted on YouTube and was taken down soon after.

In this one she explains her absence from the Today show and apologizes 'to those that I have hurt'.

Financial loss: Deen was dropped by Smithfield in the wake of the scandal, and the thing happened with the Food Network partnership

Previous appearance: Paula Deen was to appear on the Today show on Friday morning to answer questions from Matt Lauer about her past use of racial slurs - but she pulled out just before the show started

She says: 'I was invited to speak to Matt Lauer about a subject that has been very hurtful for a lot of people.

'Matt I was physically not able this 
morning, the pain has been tremendous that I have caused to myself and 
to others so I am taking this opportunity, now that i have pulled myself
together and am able to speak, to offer an apology for those I've 
hurt.'

The controversial chef and her 
handlers must have kissed-and-made-up with the Today Show as Lauer 
announced on Monday morning that Deen will now be coming on the show 
Wednesday, lest she change her mind again.

Over the weekend, her loyal fans have 
shown their support by lining up in droves to eat at her Savannah, 
Georgia restaurant, and bash the Food Network on social media.

'Everyone in this nation has used a 
racist comment at one time or another. She grew up in the South,' 
Facebook user Maria O'Donnell wrote on the channel's page.

Over the weekend, more stories about 
the chef's alleged racism as a former employee alleged that Deen and her
brother regularly called him 'my little monkey'.

being diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes, but she will have to work harder 
to throw off her apparent admissions during the videotaped deposition

Another told how as an oyster cook at one of her restaurants the black waitstaff were regularly forced to work at her private parties held at her Savannah, Georgia estate without pay.

'Paula and Bubba just gave us beer and alcohol and I don’t even drink. It was insulting and unfair. I was like, "Pay me!"' Sheldon J. Ervin told Radar.

While the Network cut ties to the 
chef, who headlined three shows on the channel that she has worked with 
for the past 11 years, QVC has waited to make any final moves.

'QVC shares the concerns being raised 
around the unfortunate Paula Deen situation. QVC does not tolerate 
discriminatory behavior,' vice president Paul Capelli said in a 
statement.

'We are closely monitoring these 
events and the ongoing litigation. We are reviewing our business 
relationship with Ms Deen, and in the meantime, we have no immediate 
plans to have her appear on QVC.'

It has not commented on whether or not they will continue to sell her line of cookware that she designed for the channel.
