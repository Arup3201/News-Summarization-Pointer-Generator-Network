They are perhaps best known for being axe-wielding warmongers who brought terror to the countries they invaded.

But despite their fearsome reputation, Vikings also had a love of jewellery and personal grooming, according to an exhibition at the National Maritime Museum in Cornwall.

The bloodthirsty raiders even seemed to like 'cute and cuddly' teddy bears and - in contrast to their association with violence and destruction - were skilled tradesmen.

Bloodthirsty? A new exhibition in Cornwall suggests Vikings were actually interested in personal grooming and jewellery

One of the displays at the National Maritime Museum shows a large bone comb with iron rivets dating back to the 9th or 10th centuries

The co-curator of the exhibition, Viking expert Gareth Williams, told the Guardian that although the Vikings' reputation was 'justified' their society was in fact 'so much more than murder and violence'.

He said: 'It’s a bit like the English football hooligans in the 1980s. They attracted the headlines and some people began to think all English people were like that. Which obviously is untrue.'

The museum, in Falmouth, has gathered artefacts from the British Museum, Ireland, Denmark and the Isle of Man for their exhibition Viking Voyagers.

One of the exhibits showed bronze cloak and scarf pins found on the shoreline of the Isle of Man and coins from north Africa or the Middle East. Experts say the discovery shows a beach market would have been held there.

The exhibition's centrepiece is a replica of a 14 metre trading ship named 'Walrus' which would have been used to transport loads of up to five tons up and down the coast

Warmongers: Although the Vikings have a reputation for death and destruction, the exhibition seeks to show other aspects of their society

Another display shows a large bone comb with iron rivets dating back to the 9th or 10th centuries.

Mr Williams told the Guardian: 'Despite the popular image of Vikings as wild and shaggy looking, bone and antler combs are very common finds.'

The display also shows toiletry sets for women that include earscoops for digging out wax.

As well as artefacts showing the Vikings interest in personal grooming, the collection also includes a brooch complete with bear heads. Mr Williams added: 'Those look like teddy bears to me. They are cute and cuddly.'

The exhibition's centre piece is a replica of a 14 metre trading ship named 'Walrus' which would have been used to transport loads of up to five tons up and down the coast.

Tehmina Goskar, the exhibitions registrar at the National Maritime Museum Cornwall, said the far west of Britain would have been an important point on a sailing route from Scandinavia to Brittany.

'We haven’t proved yet that they settled here but they raided and traded here,' she said.

'There are tantalising bits of evidence that begin to suggest they may have settled, too – why wouldn’t they? It’s a lovely place to be.'

Viking Voyagers is open from 20 March 2015 to 22 February 2017.
