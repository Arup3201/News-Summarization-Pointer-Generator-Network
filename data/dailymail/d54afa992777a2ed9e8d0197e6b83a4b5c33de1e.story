Case: The jury at Mark Duggan's inquest will hear evidence from a witness who claims she saw police plant a gun at the scene of his death

Mark Duggan was one of the most violent gangsters in the country and was linked to ten shootings and two murders, an inquest was  told yesterday.

The 29-year-old, whose death after being shot by a police marksman sparked the 2011 summer riots, opened fire in a nightclub in Christmas 2010, it was claimed.

He was also a senior member of the notorious Tottenham ManDem (TMD) gang and was implicated in   other firearms offences leading up to his death, it was alleged.

A police report shown to the jury at Duggan’s inquest said the alleged gangster and his associates ‘posed a high risk to the public and police alike’.

It said there were ‘numerous intelligence reports to suggest that members of Tottenham ManDem have access to firearms and are prepared to use them’. Acting Superintendent Michael Foote, who was in charge of the  Met’s gun crime unit in north-west London, said his team had monitored 100 gangsters since 2008.

Of these, he said Duggan was one of 48 who were considered the most dangerous. He told the jury at the Royal Courts of Justice: ‘They were considered the most violent people in London, outside London, stretching across Europe.

They were closely linked to Turkish criminal organisations.’

The officer said intelligence ‘gave a 
clear indication’ that Duggan was involved in gun crime, possession of 
ammunition and the supply of Class A drugs.

And Duggan was considered the most likely member of TMD to get hold of a gun, he added.

It was said he had shot a clubber at 
Christmas 2010, and fired shots in a car park outside a nightclub in 
February the following year.

Jurors also heard there were a number 
of ‘assaults, shootings and murders’ after TMD reignited a historical 
feud with the so-called London Fields Gang.

TMD was also said to have 
had a history of robbing rival drug dealers and turning up at nightclubs
 with guns.

One report said Duggan was ‘implicated
 in a number of recent firearms incidents’ and ‘aggressively confronted 
police’ when he was stopped near his home on the Broadwater Farm Estate 
in Tottenham, north London.

In July 2011, a month before he was 
killed, police received information that he had stashed a Beretta pistol
 at the home of his girlfriend.

In August, officers heard that Duggan 
was about to get a gun from Kevin Hutchinson-Foster in Leyton, east 
London, and later stopped the minicab in which he had travelled to pick 
it up, the court was told.

Father-of-four Duggan, who had taken 
the party drug Ecstasy, ran out of the Toyota cab and was shot twice by a
 police marksman  who claims he saw the gun wrapped in a sock and raised
 towards him, it was claimed.

One bullet hit him in his right bicep and the other struck his chest, killing him ‘in ten heartbeats’, jurors were told.

When officers looked for the gun  they
 found it up to 20 feet away on the other side of a wall from where he 
was killed, the inquest heard.

The fresh details of Duggan’s 
background emerged just days after Judge Keith Cutler controversially 
asked for silence to commemorate his life.

The judge bowed his head and clasped his hands to acknowledge the ‘regrettable loss’.

The inquest, which is expected to last for two months, continues.
