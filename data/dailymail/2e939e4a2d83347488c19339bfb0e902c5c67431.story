Alexander Wang is the latest luxury designer to create a collection for H&M.

The New York-based creative director for Balenciaga, 30, announced the venture on Instagram last night and attended a star-studded party in its honour at Coachella Festival in California.

The collection is to include a range of men's and women's clothing, as well as an array of signature accessories, and will go on sale in stores from November 6.

Famous for his street and sportwear inspired vibe, young Wang joins fashion giants Versace, Karl Lagerfeld, Stella McCartney and Matthew Williamson toÂ  Lanvin and Marni who have all designed a collection for the international High Street chain, report Vogue.co.uk.

'I am honoured to be a part of H&M's designer collaborations,' Wang said today. 'The work with their team is an exciting, fun process.

'They are very open to pushing 
boundaries and to set a platform for creativity. This will be a great 
way for a wider audience to experience elements of the Alexander Wang 
brand and lifestyle.'

'Alexander Wang is one of the most important voices in fashion today,' H&M's creative advisor Margareta van den Bosch added.

It feels incredible to be collaborating with him this year.'

Wang's Instagram page posted a video of a digital countdown to the 'Wang X HM' launch in monochrome.

Another video then confirmed that the party at music festival Coachella last night - which featured acts including Iggy Azalea - would take place under the 'Wang X HM' banner.

Hip hop artist Iggy, 23, donned a very revealing outfit to perform at the event wearing a low-cut black leather crop top which she teamed with high-waisted black and white shorts and thigh-high lace-up heels.

She and other musical acts Jesse Marco, Major Lazer and Just Blaze performed at the event to celebrate the announcement of New York fashion designer Wang's collaboration with the Swedish retail chain.
