One student in a dog agility class is drawing a lot of attention, and not just for her athletic skills. Amy Trotter is a pig.

Amid the barking of corgis, collies and Labradors, visitors at the Family Dog Training Center in Kent, Washington, will sometimes hear a snort. 

And before they know it Amy comes trotting along, jumping through the hoop, balancing on the teeter-totter, retrieving the dumbbell and zipping through the play tunnel.

Coming through: One student in a dog agility class is drawing a lot of attention, and not just for her athletic skills. Amy is a pig 

Causing commotion: Amid the barking of corgis, collies and Labradors, visitors at the Family Dog Training Center in Kent, Washington, will sometimes hear a snort 

Lori Stock, Amy's owner, already had  five dogs and two rats but she wanted a new animal to train.

She says the porker is a quick learner and very motivated by food rewards.

'She is the smartest dog I've ever trained,' Stock told KOMO News. 

'She is quite eager to participate in class and do the homework outside of class.'

Five-month-old Amy has already graduated from a puppy manners course on to agility and obedience classes.

Training center president Kathy Lang says it's not the first non-dog she has seen on site.

A few years ago a pygmy goat attended several classes.

Amy appears to have settled in well, although she did get some funny looks from her classmates at first.

'The first time [my dog] saw and heard Amy, she kind of looked at me, and looked back at Amy like, "what kind of dog is that,"' said Paula Kurtz.

Amy will demonstrate her new skills during the Seattle Kennel Club dog show next month. 

She and some of her classmates are also set to perform a 'freestyle musical dance'. She'd better remember not to hog the limelight.
