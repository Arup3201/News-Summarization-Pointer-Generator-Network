A retired nurse who saw Jimmy Savile molest a vulnerable patient told bosses but they 'shrugged off' the complaint because they 'weren't bothered in the slightest'.

June Thornton, now 82, saw the paedophile DJ indecently assault a young girl in her hospital bed while the victim recovered from brain surgery at Leeds General Infirmary  in 1972.

Mrs Thornton was herself recovering from back surgery and saw the TV star kissing and groping a young woman who was so unwell she was unable to resist.

'He just helped himself to her,' she said.

'There was no doubt it was Jimmy Saville and that he molested that woman.  I can still remember seeing exactly what he did. He just helped himself to her. He rubbed his hands over her chest and further down her front.'

Ignored: Nurse June Thornton saw Jimmy Savile abuse a patient in her bed but says her complaint was 'shrugged off' by NHS staff

She added: 'I told the nurse and she just shrugged her shoulders, she wasn't bothered in the slightest.

Upset: Mrs Thornton, who enjoyed a long medical career in York said yesterday's report was 'too little too late' 

'That nurse knew, people in the hospital knew, people everywhere knew - but  nobody did anything about it, and it is a real tragedy.

'I can just see it now, the way he touched that girl right in front of me, without a care that I was even watching.'

She added: 'All we are doing now is proving how bad Jimmy Savile was, but so many people at the time knew exactly what he was up to and that is so  frustrating.'

Mrs Thornton even says she wishes that Savile had tried to molest her in the ward, as she would have 'screamed the place down'.

'I wish he would have assaulted me,' she said.

'I would have screamed the hospital down and made absolutely sure something was done about it. 

Mrs Thornton, of York, said the reports from the NHS hospitals that yesterday laid bate Savile's disgusting crimes came 'too little, too late'.

'When I look back, if I had been taken seriously on what I said, it might have stopped a lot of other abuse from happening.

'But it's too little, too late now - that monster is dead, and he got away with it for his entire life. Not only got away with it, he was loved.

'It makes my blood boil. If he could be held to account for what he has done, I would be singing in aisles.

'I feel so frustrated that he has got away with it over and over again.' 

Crime scene: The attack took place at Leeds General Infirmary where Savile is also alleged to have abused corpses and stolen their glass eyes
