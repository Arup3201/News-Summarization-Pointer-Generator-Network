More than 11,000 children have been killed in Syria's civil war with summary executions and torture worryingly common, a major think tank claimed today.

A report by the London-based Oxford Research Group found a quarter of children killed in the conflict were shot in small arms fire while seven in 10 were blown up.

The ORG recorded a total of 11,420 child deaths - a figure which includes children caught in cross fire, as well as others allegedly targeted by snipers, summarily executed and in some cases, tortured.

The study, Stolen Futures: The hidden toll of child casualties in Syria, reveals 764 children were recorded as summarily executed, 112 were reported to have been tortured, including some of infant age.

Children in older age groups were 
targeted more often than younger children, and overall boys outnumbered 
girls killed by about two to one, according to the research.

The ORG said older boys in the 13 to 17 year old group were consistently the most 
frequent victims of targeted killings such as those involving sniper 
fire, execution or torture.

The highest child casualty figures were in the governate of Aleppo, but
relative to its size, the worst affected governorate was Daraa, where 
roughly one in 400 children was recorded killed.

In addition, 128 children were recorded killed by chemical weapons in Ghouta on August 21, 2013.

Report co-author Hamit Dardagan said: 'The data we analysed indicates that bombs and bullets alone ended the lives of ten thousand Syrian children in 30 months of war.

'The world needs to take a much closer interest in the effects of the conflict on Syria’s children.'

The ORG compiled the report using the same Syrian civil society-sourced databases it has used to produce previous casualty statistics but examines in greater detail the information they contain on victims and how they were killed.

Co-author Hana Salama added: 'What is most disturbing about the findings of this report is not only the sheer numbers of children killed in this conflict, but the way they are being killed.

'Bombed in their homes, in their communities, during day-to-day activities such as waiting in bread lines or attending school; shot by bullets in crossfire, targeted by snipers, summarily executed, even gassed and tortured.

'All conflict parties need to take responsibility for the protection of children, and ultimately find a peaceful solution for the war itself.

'This study shows why explosive weapons should never be used where children live and play, how older children quickly become targets in a war and even the youngest suffer its worst abuses.

'This grim and terrible record also shows why a sustainable peace, not more bombs and bullets, is the only way to guarantee the safety of children.'
