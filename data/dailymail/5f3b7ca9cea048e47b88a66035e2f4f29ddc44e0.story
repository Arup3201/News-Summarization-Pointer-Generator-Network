Held: Amanda Catherine Hein, 26, will remain behind bars while she awaits trial for killing her baby son moments after he was born healthy and alive

Horror: This is the toilet where the baby was found wrapped in a trash bag and hidden in the tank

Starts Pub sports bar was crowded with wrestling fans watching a major pay-per-view match when Hein gave birth in the bathroom

Day day after Hein gave birth, a janitor found the child wrapped in a plastic garbage bag, submerged in the tank behind the toilet seat.

The Lehigh Valley Express-Times reports that an autopsy found that Hein had given birth to a healthy, full-term baby boy. The child suffocated to death.

Hein said she realized she was pregnant in May or June, but did not tell anyone. None of her friends who were with her the night she gave birth knew that she was carrying a child.

They also did not know she had gone into labor on August 17.

That night, Hein and three male friends reserved a booth at Starters bar to watch the WWE SummerSlam pay-per-view wrestling match.

Her friends told police she was complaining of back pain and spasms during the match. When she excused herself, she was gone for so long that they began to send her text messages.

After she allegedly killed the baby, she stayed at the bar for another hour.

She had blood on her clothing, but refused to go home until the match was over. 

After the discovery of the child in the toilet, the waiters at Starters told police they remembered having to clean up blood at one of the booths on August 17.

Managers at the bar were able to look up who reserved the booth - which led detectives to Luis Rivera - one of Hein's friends.

Rivera led police to Hein.

When she was questioned by officers, she admitted that she had given birth to a live baby and that she had killed him and hid him the toilet after wrapping him in a plastic bag she took from the bathroom garbage can.

Because of the age of the child, Hein could be sentenced to death, if convicted of murder.

Bar owner David Rank said his staff were extremely upset by the grisly incident. He allowed 
those who wished to go home, others opted to stay and Rank opened the 
pub to customers at 1pm, two hours later than usual.

'My biggest concern is for my employees, the mother, the baby,' said Rank.

'I just want everyone to say prayers for them.'
