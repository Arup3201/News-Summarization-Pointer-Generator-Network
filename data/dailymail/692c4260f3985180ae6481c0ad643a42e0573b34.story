A legal bid to end 'slopping out' in British prisons could force the Government to spend hundreds of millions of pounds to upgrade its jails.

The lawsuit has been launched by child rapist Roger Gleaves, who claims that the practice breaches his human rights.

If successful, the case will force the Government to ensure that in-cell toilets are available 24 hours a day in all the country's prisons.

Abolished: But slopping out still happens in some British prisons

Slopping out - the use of a bucket as a toilet when there is no in-cell sanitation at a prison - was formally abolished in the UK in 1996.

But a report by the National Council of Independent Monitoring Boards published in August last year revealed that 10 UK prisons are still occasionally using the system.

Convict: Roger Gleaves claims that being denied access to a toilet breaches his human rights

Gleaves, who served time at HMP Albany on the Isle of Wight, claims his human rights were violated by the 'degrading' process of sometimes having to use a bucket as a toilet in his cell during the night.

He is joined in his claim by fellow ex-Albany inmates, Peter Kirby and Desmond Grant, and should the trio succeed the floodgates will open for more than 300 other ex-cons bringing similar actions.

Because of the financial difficulty of making alterations to some jails, especially those built in the Victorian era, the practice of slopping out still persists in a number of prisons when normal systems break down.

But now the claim spearheaded by Gleaves, which has reached the High Court, is seeking to force the extinction of slopping out, whatever the cost.

Should it succeed, lawyers say, the Government will have to spend many millions 'rebuilding' the offending jails.

Prisoners are threatening legal action against prison chiefs because they only get one TV channel showing Premiership football.

Inmates can get Sky Sports 1 in their cells, but have lodged a formal complaint to try and access other subscription sports channels.

A row broke out yesterday over their demand for 'sports rights', with an MP saying many people on the outside cannot afford the Sky channels.

Bosses at the HMP Parc in Bridgend, South Wales, confirmed prisoners get Sky Sports 1 in their cells for good behaviour.

But warders at the Category B prison say they can't afford Sky Sports at home - while the prisoners get it for free.

One warder said: 'They have TV piped into their cells and can spend all day watching Sky Sports 1.

'But they're hacked off because they don't have Sky Sports 2 and 3. They've even been moaning it is a breach of their human rights.

'It's a cushy number. I've stayed in hotels that don't have the facilities the prisoners get here.'

MP David Davies, chairman of the Welsh Affairs select committee in the House of Commons, said: 'I am aghast that we are paying for prisoners to watch Sky TV.

'It beggars belief that they are complaining about this - I haven't even got Sky Sports myself. What next? Will prisoners be given a box at the Millennium Stadium for rugby matches?

'People should not be put in prison to spend their days watching expensive satellite packages. They should be educated and learn skills for their rehabilitation when they come out.'

Gleaves was jailed for 15 years in 1998 
after being convicted of rape, attempted rape, incitement of one boy to 
rape another, and three counts of indecent assault.

Nick Armstrong, barrister for Kirby and Grant, said after a pre-trial review of the case that the Government was seeking to block the move for financial reasons.

'These claims are not really about damages - it is a matter of principle, and trying to get the system changed,' said Mr Armstrong. 'That is why the Government is so concerned - because they would have to start rebuilding prisons.'

He added that there are some 328 similar claims waiting in the wings and that about 2,000 prisoners in the UK are affected.

The claimants' solicitor said that renovating just one prison would cost close to £100million.

'In Albany Prison alone, reports conclude that it would cost upward of £12million to provide sanitation and, in doing so, the prison would either lose 700 cells, or need £70million to replace them,' he said.

Papers lodged with the court by Gleaves in 2006, kept secret from the public until last week, allege that the rapist was forced to endure a sub-standard lifestyle in Albany Prison between 2005 and 2006.

The claim states that he was in continuous danger to his physical and emotional health because of the need to use a bucket and that Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights - the prohibition on inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment - was breached by the necessity to slop out.

The Home Office's lawyer denies that toilet facilities are a human right, saying: 'The life of a prisoner must necessarily be controlled.'

The case is set to begin at the High Court in London on November 14, and will be the first time the courts in England and Wales have judged the issue.
