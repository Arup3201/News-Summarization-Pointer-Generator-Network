They say a good salesman could sell ice to an eskimo. 

The same marketing men have recognised that Abbey Clancy in her underwear can flog pretty much anything, including new  motors better than any car dealer.

The model has a starring role in a short film for a new Vauxhall car called the Adam Rocks Air, directed by Kate Moss's hairdresser James Brown.

The movie follows Abbey as she gets ready for a night out with the fictional band The Vauxhalls - named after the car company. 

The viewer's attention is easily caught early on as a topless Abbey makes up her face in a bedroom mirror as a fellow band member looks on. 

After constructing an outfit consisting of Vivienne Westwood, Saint Laurent, Nudie Jeans, Topshop, and Liberty clothes, Abbey and the band head out to their party venue in the car that the video is meant to centre on.

Their journey through east London is set to a soundtrack of “Heart Is a Beating Drum”  The Kills. 

New look: The gorgeous model steps into a retro world for the commercial  

The model plays the part of a indie band front woman, who is getting ready for a night out with her fictional band The Vauxhalls - named after the car company 

Sadly, the video ends as Abbey and co. exit the car, carrying their guitars and amps into the concert venue.

So, we never find out if the Liverpudlian model's musical capabilities match her knack of looking like the ideal front woman. 

The director James Brown said: 'I saw the car and thought I can do something exciting with this.  

String thing: Channelling her inner rock chick, the mother-of-one can be seen heading to her car with her old guitar in tow 

The second part of the film centres around the band's journey in the new Vauxhal car - the Adam Rocks Air

Despite James Brown's talents mainly lying in hairdressing, his first short movie is extremely slick 

He continued: 'I’m a hair dresser but I love clothes and fashion and rock and roll music so it was all linked for me, I was just inspired to do it.'

'When casting the film, I thought who’s young, who’s cool, who do I love and I thought of Abbey straight away.'
