Care home staff threw away a 91-year-old grandmother's wedding ring and belongings after her death - even though her family wanted to put some of them in her coffin.

Now Elizabeth Cope's granddaughter Claire says she feels staff 'put my nan in the bin'.

Mrs Cope died from pneumonia last month after a three week stay in hospital.

Staff at the Eastlake Care Home left Elizabeth Cope's granddaughter Claire Cope feeling they had 'put nan in the bin'

Ms Cope intended to place some of her grandmother's possessions in her coffin ahead of her funeral this week.

But when a friend went to the Eastlake Care Home in Goldaming, Surrey, to collect the last of the items, he was sent away.

Ms Cope then received a phone call telling her that her grandmother's things had been binned.

Staff at the home, where Mrs Cope had lived for two years at a cost of £12,000 had moved her belongings to another room after her death at the Royal Surrey County Hospital in Guildford on January 26.

Her granddaughter went with her friend Philip Bannister to take them away, but realised they needed to make a second journey.

Mrs Cope's wedding ring, family photograph albums, furniture, handbags and cuddly toys had been thrown away.

The care home then caused further upset by addressing letters to Mr Bannister rather than to Ms Cope, adding 'insult to injury'.

Claire Cope said:'I have never felt so sad.

'It is bad enough that my lovely grandmother has passed away but not being able to have her things around me is just indescribable.

'Everything has gone. 

'She had been in hospital for three weeks and the care home had moved her into a new room so there would have been no rubbish for the belongings to get mixed up with.

'She never got to see the new room. I am appalled that this was allowed to happen and I still have not had a proper apology.

'I am finding it hard to concentrate on anything because I just can't get it out of my head and it's all because of some incompetent staff member at the care home.

Granddaughter Claire Cope said: 'Not being able to have her things around me is just indescribable'

'How could anyone possibly see all those things and assume they are rubbish? There should be strict checks on these things.

'We have looked at seeking out a solicitor but it's really expensive.

'It's not really the money we are worried about anyway, it's the fact that they put my nan in the bin.

'This whole thing has caused a lot of distress and upset.'

A spokesman for Anchor, the company which operates Eastlake, said: 'We are extremely sorry for the distress this has caused and apologised to the family as soon as we were aware of the error.

'We have reviewed our processes and spoken to all members of staff to ensure the utmost care is taken with residents' possessions.

'We are meeting the family to discuss how we can make amends.'
