A serial killer convicted of murdering three teenagers in 1996 confessed to police he had also killed a 14-year-old boy 23 years ago after the two 'performed a sex act', a court heard today.

Steven Grieveson, 42, admitted to police in an interview last year that he killed schoolboy Simon Martin in 1990, a jury at Newcastle Crown Court was told.

He also told police the crime had 'haunted' him for years.

Grieveson denies murdering the schoolboy at a derelict house in Sunderland and is claiming diminished responsibility for his actions.

The man was
convicted in 1996 of murdering Thomas Kelly, 18, David Hanson and David
Grieff, both 15. They had been strangled and their bodies burned.

The jury were told that in January last year Grieveson confessed in a police interview that he had gone to Gilside House, Roker, with Simon after they played football together in May 1990.

Then 19-and-a-half, Grieveson said he and the 14-year-old 'performed a sex act'.

In the interview, he said: 'After I was finished I got scared, I started shouting at him not to tell anyone.

'I just flipped for a minute and I started strangling him. I didn’t let go and the next thing, he was on the bed.

'I think there was a rock or something and I smashed his head in.'

Grieveson, formerly from Sunderland, 
later told police he had pleaded with his victim not to tell anyone 
about their sexual contact.

'He was saying he wouldn’t tell but for some reason I didn’t believe him,' he said

William Lowe QC, prosecuting, told the jury Grieveson took the boy’s trousers and bottoms, throwing his footwear into the sea and binning the clothes.the court heard.

The court heard how Grieveson told police why he was confessing to killing the teenager.

He said: 'I needed to tell police, it has haunted us for 20 years.

'I have self-harmed because of it. It has driven me crazy and I need to give the family peace of mind, myself as well. I cannot move forward unless this is said.'

Mr Lowe, prosecuting, added: 'For whatever reason he strangled with his bare hands and with a ligature this 14-year-old boy and then smashed his skull.

'We said he did that with an intention to kill and that he is guilty of murder.'

The prosecution claimed the violence Grieveson used on Simon, and then on his three later victims, may have been to keep them quiet after sex, or to force them into engaging in homosexual acts.

On the evening of May 18, 1990 when he was murdered, Simon had been playing with friends at a local park and his mother Jean had asked him to be home for 6pm in time for his tea, Mr Lowe said.

The police were called at 8pm when he had not returned, and his father, a former soldier, and older brother went out looking for him.

His body was found on May 26 by two boys who were playing in the derelict house.

The body of Simon Martin was found at Gillside House, Sunderland, pictured. It has since been demolished

Haunted: Grieveson told police he felt compelled to confess to his involvement in Simon Martin's death because he felt 'haunted' by it

Simon, who was 5ft2 and around eight stone, was naked from the waist down and lying on a mattress. Blood was splattered on the walls and he had suffered a serious head injury.

Semen linked to Grieveson by DNA testing in 2000 was found on the boy’s body.

Bruising to his neck was also discovered, indicating he had been strangled.

Grieveson, who worked at a local fairground, had been seen walking from the park with his victim.

Three days after the body was discovered, the killer told police they had walked to a newsagents, and when he went inside the shop, Simon waited outside. By the time Grieveson left, his friend had disappeared, he claimed.

In his confession 22 years later, 
Grieveson told police he was a glue-sniffer and afraid of people finding
out he was bisexual, Mr Lowe said.

The
jury was told the defence will put forward expert witnesses who will 
give evidence to say the defendant 'by reason of an abnormality of mind'
was unable to exercise self-control, Mr Lowe said.

'The prosecution do not accept that for one minute,' the barrister said.

He added: 'Steven Grieveson had the ability to choose whether to kill him or let him go.

'He chose to kill him and he is guilty of murder and nothing less.'

Grieveson, was convicted of killing David Hanson, 15, David Grieff, 15, and Thomas Kelly, 18 in 1996.

On November 26 1993 Thomas Kelly’s body was found burning in an allotment shed behind Monkwearmouth Hospital.

On February 8 1994 David Hanson’s charred remains were found in a derelict house in Roker.

And on February 25 1994 David Grieff’s body was found in an allotment shed at the rear of Monkwearmouth Hospital.

The trial continues.
