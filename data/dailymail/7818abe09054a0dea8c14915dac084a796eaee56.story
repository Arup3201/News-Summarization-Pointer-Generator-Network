A new petrol price war erupted yesterday on the back of falling oil prices and the first 99p per litre forecourt in Britain for more than five years.

Asda sparked a 2p per litre price cut as the three other ‘Big Four’ supermarkets - Morrisons, Sainsbury’s and Tesco – swiftly followed suit. 

Price cuts will ‘ripple’ through the nation’s forecourts by putting pressure on other retailers to match them or lose business.

But it also led to calls for the Chancellor to cut fuel tax which now accounts for more than 70p in every pound spent at the pumps – the highest proportion for six years.

Pumps at the Harvest Energy's forecourt in Kings Heath, Birmingham run empty of unleaded fuel after the service station reduced the price of unleaded petrol to 99.7p a litre

The price drop prompted Asda to cut prices by 2p per litre and Morrisons, Sainsbury's and Tesco quickly followed suit 

The Tesco cut took affect yesterday while reductions by the other three companies will kick in today.

For Asda customers, the latest reduction means they will pay no more than 103.7p a litre on petrol, with diesel at 110.7p a litre.

The reductions have come after a chain of three Harvest Energy filling stations in Birmingham and the west Midlands cut the price of petrol to 99.7p a litre.

The RAC has been forecasting for weeks that petrol prices would dip below the £1-a-litre mark and welcomed the news of the Birmingham service station price cut.

As average prices continue to fall closer to the £1 mark, the RAC said the 99p charge could soon become the rule rather than the exception.

Fuel price trackers Experian Catalist said the average price before the supermarkets announced their cuts was 108.9p per litre for unleaded and 115.98 for diesel.

Ironically however, as the price of the fuel product itself falls, the proportion of the pump price which is tax going to the Chancellor has increased - and represents now more than 70 per cent of the price of unleaded petrol now goes to the chancellor in tax.

This is because duty is levied at a fixed rate of 57.95p and does not fall in line with the falling cost of the product. VAT is then levied on the total price including duty, accounting for around 18p per litre.

So even though the price is dropping, the Chancellor’s tax take remains largely unaffected other than a drop in VAT.

Asda said the 2p price reduction across its 245 filling stations was the fifteenth fuel cut since end of September, taking a total of 23p per litre off unleaded and 19p per litre off diesel, Asda’s senior vice president Barry Williams said: ‘Asda once again are leading this next round of price cuts.

‘No matter where customers live, they will benefit from the same fuel price with our national price cap of 103.7ppl for unleaded and 110.7ppl for diesel.’ He said: ‘Whilst other supermarkets will follow the fuel price drop, Asda is the only retailer that has a national price cap on fuel at all 245 filling stations.’

RAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams said: ‘The decision of three forecourts in the West Midlands to sell petrol for under £1 a litre – last seen in 2009 – is clearly having a ripple effect on the supermarkets as they are continuing to bring their prices lower still.’

He said that with a barrel of oil now costing around $47 ‘we are surely only weeks away from the milestone price of £1 a litre being a common sight at petrol stations up and down the country’.

‘This will also have a very positive effect on reducing the average price of both petrol and diesel for motorists everywhere.’

But he added:’We are now getting to a point where the share that the Treasury takes from the forecourt price is nearing 75per cent which is a bitter pill for motorists and retailers. We should perhaps be seeking a commitment from all the major political parties that they will not look to increase fuel duty in the next parliament.’

But price cuts also led to calls for the Chancellor to cut fuel tax which now accounts for more than 70p in every pound spent at the pumps – the highest proportion for six years

Professor Stephen Glaister, director of the RAC Foundation, agreed: ‘An astonishing 70p in every pound we spend at the pumps is now destined for government.

‘Because fuel duty is set at a flat rate and makes up the bulk of fuel taxation, the Chancellor is able to rely on his tax income from fuel remaining quite steady even as the underlying price of petrol and diesel falls.

‘Last week the Chancellor again publicly urged fuel companies to pass on oil price reductions to motorists. Clearly he thinks the price of fuel is still too high. Well he has an easy solution. Cut duty further.’

Professor Glaister estimates that UK drivers collectively are £330million better off each month compared with last summer because of price reductions at the pumps: ‘Yet they could be better off still, and have more money to spend on the high street, if the Chancellor revised downwards the huge proportion of tax he takes from motorists and hauliers.’

AA president Edmund King said: ‘There remains a postcode lottery out there when it comes to fuel prices. Drivers in rural areas are still paying much more than the £1.09 average price and in some places £1.18.

‘It will still take some time to get down to an average of £1 per litre, particularly as 70per cent of the pump price is tax (57.95p duty and 18.3p VAT).
