After preaching peace, acceptance and inclusion of all faiths and sexual preferences, it is no surprise that Pope Francis has got himself a mini-me.

Pope Francis has quickly become one of the most admired Catholic church leaders in both the religious and secular community, which became clear during his General Audience today.

The pontiff kissed the child, dressed up as a little pope, as he drove through the crowd at St. Peter's Square in the Vatican.

My idol and me: Pope Francis kept the young boy close as he greeted hundreds who has turned up to see him at the general audience

Unfortunately, 19-month-old Daniele De Sanctis was less pleased to see the pope, and begun to cry in the strange manâ€™s arms.

Daniele's mother Paola Ciabattini said she dressed her son as a pope in a demonstration of affection towards Pope Francis.

Another child dressed in a similar white cassock and white skullcap was also on hand, as were kids dressed as Swiss Guards.

During Carnival in Italy, children often go to school and spend their weekends dressed up costumes.

Carnival, also known as mardi gras, marks the period before the church's Lent season begins.

Bless him: It is likely that little Daniele did not realise just who was giving him a peck on the cheek

Earlier this week, Pope Francis 
announced the first major overhaul of the Vatican's outdated and 
inefficient bureaucracy in 25 years.

He
 created an economics secretariat to control all economic, 
administrative, personnel and procurement functions of the Holy See.

Australian
 Cardinal George Pell, one of Francis' core eight cardinal advisers and a
 sharp critic of current Vatican governance, was named prefect of the 
new office.

He reports to a 
new 15-member economy council made up of eight cardinals reflecting 
various parts of the world and seven lay experts.

Francis
 was elected pope a year ago on a mandate to reform the Vatican after 
documents stolen by Pope Benedict XVI's butler revealed the Holy See 
bureaucracy to be a dysfunctional, Machiavellian world of petty turf 
battles, corruption and political intrigue.
