A luxurious French island costs less to rent than a three-bedroom London flat.

A three-bedroom London flat in Knightsbridge costs £5,500 a week to rent - more than £1,000 per week more than a 25-acre island on a stunning French river.

The incredible isolated island on the River Seine near Paris, France, is up for rent for under £5K a week - and comes complete with a villa nearly twice the size of the city pad.

Classy: A three-bedroom flat in Knightsbridge costs £5,500 to rent a week...

...but for £1,000 less you can your own French island

The beautiful island of Chantemesle is a small paradise of approximately 25 acres and contains a charming villa built in the local style.

The island, 30 miles northwest of Paris, is set between the villages of Vétheuil and La Roche-Guyon and can be rented exclusively through Vladi Private Islands.

The main island house has a luxurious living room with a large fireplace, a dining room, a fully equipped kitchen, a cloakroom and a Victorian veranda.

Sizeable: The master bedroom in the Knightsbridge flat is modern and fresh

Colourful: Whereas the French bedroom has its own, acquired taste

Clean: The flat's kitchen is sharp and modern, and grants enough room to enjoy your cooking

Clear view: The French house's 'winter garden' offers one to unwind

The total living space is over 400 square metres and the property has five bedrooms and four bathrooms - which have been newly renovated, inside and out.

The London apartment is located on the second floor of a new development near Harrods.

Named Lancelot Place, the flat is on the market with Chestertons Lettings and is one of their most luxurious London lettings.

The 2766 square feet apartment features wood flooring and gas fireplace in the reception room, air conditioning, audio system and well proportioned rooms.

Picture this: The French house is set in beautiful greenery

Nice and quiet: You are sure to have some privacy in this French delicacy

High class: But you can't deny the London flat has it's own classical style
