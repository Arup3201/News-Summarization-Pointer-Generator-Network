A ‘secret millionaire’ who lived in a council flat left his entire £1.1million life savings to a hospital charity after his death, it has emerged.

Former railway worker James Redgate, of Nottingham, chose to donate the legacy to a good cause instead of friends and relatives - who have praised his generosity.

Mr Redgate, who never married and had no children, appeared to live a frugal life, according to neighbours, and is thought to have built up his fortune by saving his wages and pension.

He stunned staff at the Nottingham Hospitals Charity with the seven-figure donation following his death at the age of 83 in 2011.

Act of kindness: James Redgate left £1.1million to a Notttingham Hospital Trust. His money bought two new state-of-the-art CT  scanners. Pictured, his sister Joan (left) and other relatives in front of one of the scanners

Mr Redgate lived 
with his mother in Arnold, Nottingham, before she died of leukaemia, and
 his family believe it may have been the care and treatment that she 
received which prompted him to leave the cash to Nottingham Hospitals 
Charity in his will.

Mr Redgate also suffered from the disease.

The charity has now spent the money, which totalled £1.1m, on two new CT scanners that will help thousands of patients.

However, rather than feeling they have missed out on a windfall, Mr Redgate’s family have hailed his extraordinary generosity.

Speaking at the unveiling of the scanners, his sister Joan said: 'I had no idea this would happen, it’s been such a surprise.

'James would have been so happy that this new scanner is going to help so many people. That’s the sort of person he was, if he could help someone he would.

'Our mum would have been very proud of him.'

The ground-floor council flat of Mr Redgate. The former railways worker, who never married and had no children, is thought to have built up his fortune by saving his wages and pension.

His identity was initially kept secret when the donation was first announced last year.

Former neighbours of Mr Redgate, who is thought to have served in the army before working on the railways, said he seemed to live a basic life in his humble ground-floor council flat.

Patricia Barber, 82, said: 'He had lived here since he was in his 70s. We used to chat over the garden fence, just passing the time of day.

'He didn’t have a car and used to go away on coach trips with his sister. He never gave any indication of being wealthy. In fact, you would say he lived quite frugally.

'He apparently never married and seems to have spent much of his life looking after his parents, especially when they were elderly.

'The only person he seemed close to was his sister. You wouldn’t say he was reclusive, he would walk to the shops most days.'

She added: 'He loved spending time in his garden but in later years couldn’t get around much because his legs had gone. He never gave an sign of being that well-off. He was a very nice gentleman.'

Another neighbour, who asked not to be named, said: 'It’s incredible, we never knew he had so much money. It’s like something out of the Secret Millionaire TV show.

'But I think what he’s done is marvellous. It’ll help so many people.'

The new scanners, which are replacing older models, are faster, reduce the radiation dose to patients by a fifth, aid early diagnosis and help improve treatment.

One each will be placed at Nottingham’s two major hospitals.

Barbara 
Cathcart, chief executive of Nottingham Hospitals Charity, said at the 
time of the donation: 'He has relatives, but his life savings came to us. We knew 
nothing of it.

'He
 had his reasons for giving that he took to the grave, because his 
family do not know why. It wasn’t malicious. He just gave it all to us.'

After
 the scanners were unveiled this week, Mrs Cathcart said: 'This is an 
incredibly generous donation, which will help many thousands of patients
 in the Nottingham area.

'We
 are so grateful to James Redgate for remembering Nottingham Hospitals 
Charity in his will, and would like to thank his family for joining us 
at the official opening of the first of two scanners that are being 
purchased in Mr Redgate’s memory.

'Through
 his generosity and kindness, we are able to ensure that patients at the
 City Hospital and the Queen’s Medical Centre can benefit from the very 
latest technology in CT scanning.'
