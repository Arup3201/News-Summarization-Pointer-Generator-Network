Arsenal are considering a £7million swoop for Celtic defender Virgil van Dijk in an attempt to solve their defensive headache.

Speaking at Thursday's Annual General Meeting, manager Arsene Wenger confirmed he will look to sign a central defender in January.

And Van Dijk is emerging as a prime contender amongst the Gunners hierarchy.

Arsenal looked into the prospect of signing Van Dijk, 23, on transfer deadline day but couldn't get a deal over the line.

But the Gunners are set to revive their interest in January as they look to bolster their defensive options Arsenal have nine first-team players unavailable for tomorrow's clash against Hull City.

Wenger's biggest concern is in defence, with Laurent Koscielny (Achilles), Mathieu Debuchy (ankle) and Calum Chambers (suspended) all unavailable for the repeat of last year's FA Cup final.

Koscielny's long-term fitness is major concern. The Achilles injury is a long-standing problem, which has deteriorated in recent weeks.

'It has got worse, he finds it difficult to play with at the moment,' said Wenger, who insisted France international does not require surgery.

'If you wait for it to be better, it can be a short time. If you want to get rid of it completely, it is long term.

'We will monitor him and as soon as he can take enough pain again he will play.'

The fear is Koscielny's injury could manifest itself into a problem that could see him miss months rather than weeks, leaving Wenger with the dilemma of whether to hand Koscielny an extended break in hope that the Achilles does not become a serious hinderance or continue playing the Frenchman and risk aggravating the injury further.

Koscielny's absence means Wenger is almost certain to use left-back Nacho Monreal as a makeshift central defender alongside Per Mertesacker against Hull in a back-four that could also consist of rookie right-back Hector Bellerin and Kieran Gibbs.
