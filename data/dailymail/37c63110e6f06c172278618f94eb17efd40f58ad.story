The blue suede shoes are the only ones Elvis Presley was known to have owned after his hit single

The only pair of blue suede shoes Elvis Presley owned after his hit single are expected to sell for $80,000.

The iconic size 10 brogues were ordered for him after he hit the charts with Blue Suede Shoes in 1956.

They became part of Elvis's wardrobe of stage outfits and were worn by him so much the soles have circular wear from his famous gyrating dance moves that wowed audiences.

They are the only known pair of blue suede shoes owned by Elvis in existence.

Elvis
 owned them for four years before he gifted them to his best man and 
roadie Joe Esposito during a wardrobe clear-out after returning from 
duty in the US Army in 1960.

In 1994 they were bought by museum owner Chris Davidson who put them on display at his Elvis-A-Rama institution in Las Vegas.

Experts have tipped the shoes to fetch $80,000 when they go under the hammer.

Included
 in the sale is a letter from the manager of Elvis' costume suppliers 
Nudie's Rodeo Tailors requesting The King's clothing sizes including his
 shoes.

A pencil note on the 1956 letter reveals Elvis was a size 40 chest, a 32 inch waist and size 10 shoes.

The tailors also created Elvis's famous $10,000 gold lame suit, worn by the singer on the cover of his 50,000,000 Elvis Fans Can't Be Wrong album.

A letter from Esposito included in the sale confirms they were a present from Elvis in 1960 on his return from active duty.

Darren
 Julien, from Julien's Auctions which is now selling the shoes, said: 
'In terms of collectors' items it doesn't get better than Elvis' very 
own blue suede shoes.

The iconic size 10 brogues are being auctioned next month and are expected to sell for $80,000

'These are the only blue suede shoes owned by Elvis in the world and they are representative of one of Elvis' most iconic songs.

'Ironically Blue Suede Shoes was more of a success for Carl Perkins who wrote and released the song in 1955 but it's Elvis' version a year later that people remember.

'Elvis wore these shoes on stage and the soles have circular wear on them - proof of Elvis' stage moves.

'For years they took centre stage at the Elvis-A-Rama Museum is Las Vegas until it shut down in 2006. There was even a magazine article written about these very shoes.

'They are to Elvis what the Thriller jacket is to Michael Jackson, the white subway dress is to Marilyn Monroe and the red slippers are to Judy Garland.

'Elvis' collectability continues to grow and there is a very strong market for these kinds of items.

'He was an all-American legend and he lives on through his songs like Blue Suede Shoes.'

Blue Suede Shoes was originally a number one hit for Carl Perkins in 1955.

But it is Elvis' cover version released the following year that many associate the song with, despite it only reaching number 20 in the charts.

Elvis re-released the song in 1960 for the soundtrack to his film G.I. Blues.

The shoes have matching blue laces and gold grommets.

The auction will take place on December 6 in Los Angeles.
