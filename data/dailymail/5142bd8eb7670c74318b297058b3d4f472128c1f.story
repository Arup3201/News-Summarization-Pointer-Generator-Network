A woman who lost control of her SUV on an ice-covered road and drove it into a frigid lake with her five-year-old daughter in the vehicle was rescued by a brave stranger.

Carrie Mattingly and her daughter Ava had climbed out the driver’s side window of the SUV as it was slowly sinking into the lake when Jeff Oliver and several co-workers were driving by.

Oliver ran to the shore, took off his work boots off and dove into the lake.

Scary moment: Carrie Mattingly, 43, lost control of her SUV on an ice-covered road and drove it into a frigid lake with her five-year-old daughter Ava in the vehicle

'Stay calm': 'I just kept telling my daughter to stay calm, we are going to be okay, and we are calm,' said Mattingly

Worried for her daughter: 'I can not get images out of my mind already, I just do not know what it is going to be like for her,' said Mattingly about her 5-year-old daughter Ava

He got about half way, but the water was too cold, he said. 

He swam back to where he could touch the bottom of the lake and then went back again for Mattingly and her daughter.

As Oliver swam out to the car, other people in the area jumped into the freezing lake to help out. 

Oliver was finally able to make it out to rescue little Ava.

‘I was able to swim and grab her hand and pull her towards me and swim a little more and pull her along until we got to the shore where there were multiple people there that were able to help,’ he told Fox59 in Indianapolis.

Just in time: Mattingly and Ava had climbed out the driver¿s side window of the SUV as it was slowly sinking into the lake when stranger Jeff Oliver and several co-workers were driving by

The people in the water made a human-chain and passed the 5-year-old along to the bank.

‘I don’t know what it takes, I just know you cannot sit there and watch someone die,’ said Oliver. ‘You have got to try and help as much as you can.’

After her daughter made it to land safely, Mattingly started to swim towards the bank.

Oliver ended up in the same ambulance as Carrie and Ava Mattingly.

It turned out after the brave effort to save two strangers in need of help that Oliver actually knew Mattingly’s husband. He had never met her before that day.

‘The fact that it was a friend of my husband’s,’ said Mattingly. ‘How does that happen?’

The 43-year-old mother suffered minor bruises when her car went into the lake. Her daughter was unharmed.

Mattingly told Fox59 that the incident has changed her forever and has given her a new appreciation for her family and life in general.

‘That is all I can think about right now, how did we survive that? How did that happen?  Thank God we did and wow, I need to make it to church every Sunday,’ she said.

It was believed at first that Mattingly and her daughter were in water 60 to 80 feet deep, according to WIBC, but the depth has since been determined to have been only about to ten to 15 feet.

Brave man: Oliver swam out to the car as other people in the area jumped into the freezing lake to help out. Mattingly and her daughter made it back to land safely
