Falling asleep on a stranger has been named as the 'most awkward' situation on board a plane. 

It's one of those incidents where if it's you using your neighbour's shoulder for a nap there's deep embarrassment, but when others do it, it's a platform of entertainment.  

New research by a flight comparison website in the UK has discovered the top 10 most awkward scenarios that Britons have encountered or witnessed whilst travelling by air.

If you woke up yourself to find someone asleep on you, it would certainly be rather awkward

And falling asleep on a random stranger on-board the same flight tops the list of most commonly seen or experienced.

As many as three quarters of Britons have come across an awkward situation during a flight before, research from flight comparison website www.Jetcost.co.uk has revealed.

1. Falling asleep on a stranger - 65%

2. Dropping overhead luggage/items onto the passenger sat below - 61%

3. Arguments/confusion over seat allocations - 54%

4. Falling onto a fellow passenger accidentally - 50%

5. Embarrassing bodily functions (breaking wind, burping) - 49%

6. Dribbling whilst asleep - 48%

7. Lovers’ tiff/couple arguing - 36%

8. Walking in on someone on the loo (or being walked in on) - 29%

9. Screaming/misbehaving children - 22%

10. Travel sickness - 14%

Almost 2,500 Britons aged 18 and over, all of whom stated that they had flown at least once in the past two years, were quizzed about any embarrassing encounters or experiences they may have had or witnessed whilst flying.

All respondents were asked if they had ever encountered any particularly awkward situations during a flight (either that they had witnessed or experienced themselves), to which just over three quarters admitted that they had. 

When provided with a list of possibly awkward scenarios and asked to select all those they'd witnessed or experienced, the most common, awkward in-flight scenario was seeing a passenger fall asleep on a stranger.

Not far behind in the ranking table was dropping items on a passenger (61 per cent), followed in third by arguments over seating (54 per cent). 

According to the poll, when witnessing an awkward situation, almost three fifths of respondents, 61 per cent, admitted that that they couldn't help but 'watch as the incident unfolded', with the remaining respondents stating they either 'shared awkward glances with fellow passengers' (21 per cent) or tended to 'awkwardly look away, pretending not to notice what's going on' (18 per cent).

A screaming child on a plane, not surprisingly, makes the list of the most awkward situations

Wanting to determine if Britons encountered more awkward situations than others from within Europe, 1,000 respondents in total from France, Germany, Italy and Spain were quizzed about their experiences, with an even 25 per cent split from each country. 

All respondents were asked 'Have you encountered or experienced any particularly awkward situations during a flight before?'

Like the British, 64 per cent of Spanish respondents had encountered or experienced awkward or uncomfortable situations on-board a flight, whilst only 21 per cent from Germany, 18 per cent from Italy and nine per cent from France had been so unfortunate.

Couples arguing has been spotted by 36 per cent of plane travellers, who often listen on for laughs

Antoine Michelat, co-founder of Jetcost.co.uk, said: 'We're a little shocked that a couple of instances of arguing and fighting made it into the top ten, but then when you're a long flight with limited space for movement it's no surprise that tempers can flare. 

'It's always wise to remember where you are though and how much trouble you can get into for becoming a nuisance – it wouldn't be the first time a pilot has had to divert a plane to remove a nuisance passenger.

'No matter how embarrassing, sometimes we just can't help but watch as others are put into awkward situations, just to see how it plays out – there's no better place to do this than on a flight where you're confined to a limited space with lots of random strangers. 

'However, it is undoubtedly a completely different story when you find yourself stuck in one of these situations and you have tonnes of eyes peering out at you.'
