To commemorate the anniversary of their son’s tragic death, one family decided to celebrate the occasion with three people whose lives their son saved through organ donation.

Last year, 18-year-old college freshman Ty Osman was 
driving to Fort Worth, Texas when he stopped at the scene of a roadside 
accident to help a stranded woman.

According to mother Nancy and father, also named Ty, this was typical behavior for their son.

Noble death: Just as Osman (left) died trying to help someone, he also helped people in his death, like 69-year-old Paul Mores, who now has Osman's heart pumping inside him

‘He died a noble death,’ said Ty Osman.

As he helped the woman, the younger Ty was struck and killed by a passing truck, while the woman he sought to help survived.

And so, thanks to Ty, did three other men.

These are the people with whom Ty and Nancy chose to spend the one-year anniversary of their beloved son’s death.

Better times: As the recipients of Ty's organ's gathered with their families and with Ty's, Ty's mother Nancy told stories about her beloved son

In attendance were the three men saved by Osmon's organs as well as their grateful families.

Thanks to one of Ty’s kidneys, a man named Fletcher Carter was able to attend the event.

‘Even though that truck may have hit 
that kidney, it’s working fine’ Carter said to the laughs of a room everyone in the room.

Kelly Barns and Paul Mores were also able to attend.

Happy families: Rather than a day of sorrow, the Osmans celebrated the many people their son helped live

Barns received Osmon’s pancreas and other kidney while 69-year-old Mores received his young heart.

During the event, Mores had a tearful encounter with Nancy Osman, who between she and her husband was the most insistent the event be held.

‘First thing I told her,’ Mores told KDFW while holding back tears, ‘is I don’t feel worthy. He was such a good kid with his whole life ahead of him.’

Bittersweet: 'He died a noble death,' said Osman's father, pictured with his two sisters and mother

Though
Osman died while being the good Samaritan his parents say he was his 
whole life, it is a happy irony that he helped so many people after his 
own death.

And that, according to the Osmans, is the reason they wanted so badly to bring all those he helped together to celebrate his life.

'We’ve been at the threshold, on the door of despair,' Ty Osman said. 'But never entered in. We’ve always been at peace.'
