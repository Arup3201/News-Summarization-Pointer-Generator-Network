A Texas mother has been arrested for allegedly brutally attacking her six-week-old son because he would not stop crying.

The little boy, who had teeth marks and bruises all over his body, was also allegedly hit with an unknown object and slammed to the ground.

Deputites in Highlands said the child's mom, Dawn Elizabeth Greene, 24, was found passed out next to him.

The boy was airlifted to a hospital in Houston, where he is recovering from internal injuries.

Under arrest: A police officer in Highlands, Texas, holds up the head of Dawn Elizabeth Greene so that her mugshot can be taken. The 24-year-old is accused of brutally attacking her six-week-old son

Attacked: The little boy allegedly suffered internal injuries and bleeding after being bitten, hit with an unknown object and slammed to the floor

A man claiming to be the child's father told KHOU: 'She gets like that when she's drunk.'

Police said a concerned relative called 911 to report the incident.

It is unclear whether that relative was the father.

The father, named as Darren Autrey, said he has been attempting to get custody of his son, however his name was not put on the boy's birth certificate.

He claimed he had been trying to visit the baby at the weekend but Greene would not let him.

She then allegedly admitted to hurting him.

'She kind of mumbled that she bit him,' said Autrey.

'It's been one of my biggest fears because she did it to me.'

Greene has been charged with injury to a child.

Court documents list her hands and teeth as deadly weapons, KHOU reported.

She is being held without bond.
