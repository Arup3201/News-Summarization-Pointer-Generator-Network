Curiosity certainly got the better of this Austrian cat who got stuck in the grill of her owner's car and was inadvertently put through a car wash.

It was only when owner Reinhold Pratl, 53, stopped to get petrol and switched the engine off that he heard a screeching noise and realised that his cat, Murli, was wedged behind the bumper.

But by that time Mr Pratl had already driven 15 miles from his home in the city of Hartberg in east Austria to the nearby town of Oberwart and put his car through a car wash.

Unexpected wash and blow dry: Murli the cat was put through a car wash after getting stuck behind the grill of her owner's car in Austria

Stowaway: The cat's owner Reinhold Pratl, 53, said that he had heard a screeching noise when he parked at the car wash, but thought it was a noise from the engine

He had heard the noise before but thought it was a noise from the car's engine.

He said: 'I wanted to wash my car, when I heard the noise and then realised it was my cat I was really shocked.

'I have no idea how she got wedged in there - but they had to get the local automobile club to free her.

'I had to drive there - very slowly.'

Fortunately the cat was unharmed during its ordeal.

Mr Pratl added: 'Murli was still wet when she came out and smelled of shampoo - I put her in a box in the boot to take her home.'

Help: The Austrian Automobile, Motorcycle and Touring Club had to dismantle large parts of the front of the car to free the cat

A spokesman for the Austrian Automobile, Motorcycle and Touring Club Gerald Kainz, who helped rescue the cat, said: 'It was not an easy operation, we had to dismantle a fair bit of the car to get to the cat.

'That included the bumper and lights.

'It's amazing really that she survived the trip from Hartberg to Oberwart and then the car wash unharmed.'
