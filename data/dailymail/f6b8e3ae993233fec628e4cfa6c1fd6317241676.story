A doctor who had a sexual relationship with a patient after examining his genitals and exchanged medical matters with another patient through social media has been suspended for three months.

General practitioner Biljana Nikolova-Trask allegedly violated the professional boundaries between herself and three patients in Broken Hill in the far west outback of NSW.

It was alleged that Dr Nikolova-Trask was involved in a ‘close personal relationship’ with a man, known as Patient A while treating his wife, Patient B and daughter Patient C in 2009.

The Health Care Complaints Commission (HCCC) heard that she developed a friendship with Patient B and provided blood test results and medical advice via Facebook and text messaging.

Shortly after Patient A separated from his wife, Patient B – Dr Nikolova-Trask and Patient A started a sexual relationship in June 2010.

It is understood the practitioner and Patient A are now in a ‘de facto relationship and have a daughter, aged two-and-a-half at the date of the hearing,’ a statement from the Tribunal said.

It was further alleged that between 2008 and 2009, Dr Nikolova-Trask maintained a ‘close personal relationship with another patient, known as Patient D.

The New South Wales Civil and Administrative Tribunal found that the pair had communicated outside of work and ‘exchanged many text messages often in the early hours of the morning’.

'Patient D continued to see the practitioner on a professional basis in 2009 on four separate occasions between January 2009 and June 2009,’ a statement from the tribunal said.

But the practitioner denied she stayed overnight at Patient D's home, or that she 'engaged in a sexual relationship with him'.

It was alleged that Dr Nikolova-Trask maintained a ‘close personal relationship' with a number of patients

On July 17 2009, Dr Nikolova-Trask sent a facebook message to Patient B claiming that she was staying overnight at another home on a 'particular street'.

'Patient B asserts she understood the relevant house to be Patient D's home', the statement said.

One month later, the practitioner examined Patient D's genital. Following the consultation, she discussed  the possibility of starting a sexual relationship with him and asked if he could transfer to another practitioner.

In February 2010, Patient D was seen again by Dr Nikolova-Trask after he was in a motorbike accident.

It was alleged that she 'engaged in improper conduct' with Patient D where she continued to treat him while maintaining an intimate personal relationship with him.

She is prohibited from working as a sole practitioner for three years and must work under supervision

The Tribunal found that Dr Nikolova-Trask’s conduct is a ‘serious breach of the standards the public have a right to expect of a practitioner’.

But it also found that the practitioner's evidence  'demonstrated a lack of insight into the seriousness of her conduct'.

The HCCC said Dr Nikolova-Trask's conduct in concealing from her close friend Patient B and her relationship with Patient A may have been 'morally wrong' but it was 'not misconduct'.

Along with her three months suspension, the Tribunal ordered that Dr Nikolova-Trask is prohibited from working as a sole practitioner for three years.

Within 12 months of the expiration of her suspension, she must complete a ‘Medical Ethics’ course at her own expense and be practised under a professional mentor for at least 18 months.
