On Sunday night, one of BBC Sport’s most famous faces completes more than 20 years of football punditry delivered with its own special brand of ‘touch and technique’.

Alan Hansen fittingly hangs up his broadcast boots at the end of the biggest game in world football, in a country that simply oozes its love for the sport.

A little while ago he decided it would be both the perfect match, and the perfect moment, to head into retirement with his latest BBC contract having fully run its course.

Match of the Day master: Alan Hansen will hang up his mic this Sunday after 22 years of loyal service as a Match of the Day pundit. His final appearance in the studio will come during the BBC's coverage of the World Cup final between Germany and Argentina at the Maracana

He was a class act as a footballer; an elegant defender who helped provide the central spine of several great Liverpool teams. Hansen retired shortly after his close friend Kenny Dalglish dramatically left Anfield in 1991.

A short break followed before ‘Big Al’ had to decide which direction the rest of his life would take him, prompted no doubt by his lovely wife Janet. Some early work with a fledgling Sky Sports and BBC Radio 5 Live opened up broadcasting as a possible future career path.

He had already decided football management wasn’t for him.

I had known Alan for several years and was looking to put a new on-screen team together for the return of that regular Saturday night institution Match of the Day. The much-loved programme was about to feature English football’s new big thing, the Premier League.

Alan was the perfect fit. He had a personal trophy cabinet full to bursting, was articulate and knowledgeable about his sport, and he was a handsome so-and-so.

Alan joined the hugely-respected Desmond Lynam and the wonderfully controversial Jimmy Hill.

When the new series of Match of the Day got under way, Alan was on board but learning a new craft.

As editor of the programme I tried to assist him in his early shows. I said: ‘Alan, I’ve watched a thousand matches and you’ve played a thousand matches, let’s watch the same match being relayed into BBC TV Centre on Saturday afternoon and your target should be to spot something I don’t and make that the subject of your analysis later on Match of the Day.’

Not rocket science but hopefully a piece of sensible advice and one Alan ran with. He was flying solo within weeks. Sitting in the studio gallery, I’d watch him getting a little nervous as the famous titles were running but soon, guided by Des, he was into his analysis and that familiar unmistakable delivery of ‘pace and power’ was off and running.

We quickly put the lock on the swivel chair he sat in and Janet joined us in persuading him not to slouch. The rest came naturally. He didn’t say things just for effect and was very much his own man. He was in it for the long term.

Saturday afternoons over the next few seasons became a favourite part of the week as Des, Alan, Jimmy and Gary Lineker would enjoy banter, have a go in the sweep, over-indulge on wine gums and take their turn on the tea run, all the while watching that day’s Premier League action.

Helped by long-time colleague Niall Sloane, Alan established himself as a powerful advocate for good defending. Teamed up with Mark Lawrenson again, he was an intelligent reader of the game and a perceptive judge of player and team — and all without a technical gizmo in sight.

He even survived, with a smile, the memorable ‘You can’t win anything with kids’ remark that set  Liverpool’s arch-rivals, Sir Alex Ferguson and Manchester United, on course for the double!

Whoops! Hansen's bold prediction that Manchester United wouldn't win anything with kids during the 1995-1996 season backfired spectacularly as Alex Ferguson's team claimed a Double of Premier League title and FA Cup

Alan Hansen: Player and Pundit, BBC One, Friday 11 July 10.35pm

Having started his playing career at Partick Thistle, Alan spent 14 years at Liverpool, a loyal servant to the club. In broadcasting he has done the same, spending over two decades with the BBC, sticking with them when occasionally contracts and people went elsewhere.

When Des moved to ITV, Alan built up a strong rapport with new presenter Lineker that endures to this day — 22 years of loyal service with the Corporation, with just a brief ‘loan spell’ to ITV when he was spotted pushing a supermarket trolley around the aisles during the odd commercial break!

As well as his television work, Alan has been a consistent source of comfort and compassion for those people affected by the Hillsborough disaster.

He was in the Liverpool team that desperate afternoon in April 1989 and has been at the side of the  distressed families from that moment since. His concern is as genuine as it is long-standing.

Alan will slip into retirement from the media spotlight comfortably. He’s left on his own terms with plenty of good memories behind him.

He has a loving family around him, is never short of a golf match with Kenny and will sit down on a Saturday night and wait for that famous piece of music that heralds the start of a programme he has helped make his own.
