They stood Canute-like at the water’s edge, watching, waiting, wondering.

All
along the swollen River Severn, at vantage points beside what used to 
be its banks, clutches of people gathered by the swirling tide to try to
gauge whether the same murky water would be in their front rooms by 
daybreak.

Old hands had 
already donned wellies or waders and dug out the home insurance 
company’s number. Those too young to have witnessed the Great Flood of 
2007 excitedly took pictures on their mobiles.

Rising tide: In scenes reminiscent of the devastating floods of 2007, water surrounds the town of Tewkesbury, Gloucestershire, after days of torrential rain

Huge swathes of the Gloucestershire countryside have been submerged underwater after the wettest April on record

Going under: Pictures from ground level show the extent to which Tewkesbury has been battered by flooding in recent days

On a day when 36 flood warnings were 
in place across England and Wales and a 52-year-old man was killed after
his wife’s car was swept into 5ft of floodwater in Berkshire, the 
Gloucestershire town of Tewkesbury was facing the prospect of another 
disaster.

Jack 
Jackson-Smith, a veteran of the last deluge, let out a sigh as he 
watched the waves lap around his boots on the partly submerged road near
his home.

‘Here we go 
again,’ he said. Which might – or might not – sum up the fate that 
awaited the town last night as torrential rain threatened to bring more 
misery to a community still recovering from the devastation of five 
summers ago.

The last time I
came here, I drove down the High Street in a dumper truck with 4ft of 
water washing over the bucket. The only other way to get around was by 
boat.

Scores of people were trapped and hundreds of houses devastated on what became known locally as the Isle of Tewkesbury.

Catastrophic: Five years ago one of the iconic images of the widespread flooding was this shot of Tewkesbury Abbey surrounded by water

Tewkesbury was turned into a virtual island after the 2007 floods, and as the River Severn burst its banks again this year there were familiar scenes

Nice weather to walk the dog: Ian Handford and his dog Casper take a stroll near the swollen banks of the Severn as the rising water levels showed no signs of dying down

Rain stops play: Floodwaters rise around Tewkesbury Cricket club as much of England and Wales is braced for flooding as further heavy rain continues to wreak havoc across the country

Road in Devon

So although I found nothing yesterday 
that mirrored flooding on the same scale, only the foolhardy would rule 
out the possibility of it happening again.

Swollen
waters after the wettest April since records began in 1910 were 
expected to rise further as the Environment Agency warned that ‘heavy 
and intense rainfall’ was on its way last night in many areas.

So
how were the good folk of Tewkesbury conducting themselves yesterday in
the face of what some feared would be another Biblical-style disaster? 
Well, they were mostly just getting on with life.

‘This
is not a flood,’ said Samantha Snape, 38-year-old owner of the 
picturesque Lower Lode Inn, where the water had spilled over the Severn 
banks and was sloshing a few feet from her doorstep.

‘This is a flood,’ she told me, pointing to a 2007 photograph of the 15th-century building partly submerged.

To her left was a brass plaque that marked how deep the water was last time. It’s screwed in several inches above waist height.

Waterlogged: Farming fields in Gloucestershire also bore the brunt of the severe conditions which have emerged in the past week

Taking evasive action: Sheep and livestock were also forced to move away from the rising waters amid near-identical scenes to 2007

Warnings: Rising levels of water have once again put Tewkesbury on high alert

The water levels have once again crept up almost to the walls of Tewkesbury Abbey, with surrounding fields also in danger

Outside in brilliant sunshine and 
temperatures approaching 20c (68f), a few hardy souls and 4x4 drivers 
sipped beer from a table overlooking a jetty. Only its wooden boardwalk 
was visible yesterday.

A few minutes’ drive away, in the centre of town, water was creeping towards Tewkesbury Abbey.

‘That’s
just a puddle,’ said Horace Cornwell, an 88-year-old ex-lorry driver. 
‘If we don’t get masses of rain, the water will be gone before the end 
of the week. If we do... don’t quote me.’

Residents have been told that sandbags will be available from the council, but yesterday I saw none.

There
may be a kind of taboo about putting them out early, but in any case, 
several people told me, they are virtually useless at stopping anything 
more than the wash from passing vehicles.

Tewkesbury
Cricket Club, naturally, had put the covers on and a helpful chap 
beneath a sign that pointed to Tewkesbury’s ‘Riverside Picnic Area’ 
explained the water was already at table-top height.

Impact: Exactly how much water has surrounded the town of Tewkesbury in Gloucestershire can been seen from the air

Nets: The pitch raincover was flooded and practice nets were well and truly out of use at the cricket club as floodwaters rise around Tewkesbury

Wet again: The familiar flooding has again engulfed Gloucesterhire after forecasters recorded the wettest April on record

The one thing you wouldn’t see anywhere yesterday was a hosepipe.

Even in what might be the wettest drought Tewkesbury has ever known, they’re still banned.

Water Minister Richard Benyon said: ‘The sad truth is we actually need much more rain.’

The
man killed at a flooded river ford near Newbury, Berkshire, had not 
been named last night, but the couple were understood to be from 
Teddington, West London.

Their hatchback was submerged after being swept 150 yards downstream from a flooded road. Residents said drivers regularly got stuck after being led into the ford by satellite navigation systems.

The 54-year-old woman driver escaped through a window but her husband was trapped and died.

The
couple’s dog was also killed and police are expected to investigate 
reports that the man had been struggling to free the terrified pet.

The
Badminton Horse Trials in Gloucestershire – at which the Duke and 
Duchess of Cambridge had been due to present a prize – have been 
cancelled for only the second time ever because the course is 
waterlogged.
