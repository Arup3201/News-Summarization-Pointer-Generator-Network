Donald Trump says he's the Republican Party's top choice to run for governor of New York, telling NBC's TODAY show on Thursday that 'Republican leaders want me to run so badly.'

Trump is not running – at least not yet – but that hasn't stopped him from using the possibility as a launching pad to promote his business ventures and vent his political spleen.

'I think it can be won,' he said of the race to oust Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo. But 'the Republican Party in New York is a mess,' Trump claims, giving him an easy out if the whole idea is a giant tease.

Meanwhile, the multi-billionaire real estate tycoon has also left the door open for a presidential run, which some GOP insiders say would be a more logical salve for his ever-expanding ego.

Donald Trump appeared on the TODAY show to promote his Miss USA pageant, but steered the conversation toward his political aspirations

'There's no way "The Donald" would be satisfied with running just one state,' laughed a Republican operative in New Hampshire who declined to be named.

'And besides, can you imaging the great and all-powerful Trump living in Albany and giving up his Apprentice series? The mind boggles.'

But Monroe County, N.Y. Republican chairman Bill Reilich told Capital New York on Thursday that Trump had 'spoken to me directly and told me that when he announces his candidacy [for governor], he's prepared to put $50 million in a bank account.'

That amount would trump – pun intended – Cuomo's $33 million war chest.

'It takes some effort to amass this. That's occurring, as I understand it, now,' Reilich said. 'As soon as the filming of [The Apprentice] is complete, he's then going to focus toward the May convention.'

Trump may have his sights set even higher. Clipping a microphone to his lapel has been a reliable prescription lately for an attack on the Obama White House, and few long-shot presidential candidates can command such a large stage to level his charges.

'[Vladimir] Putin has eaten Obama's lunch, and therefore our lunch for a long time,' he said Thursday, complaining about a weak-willed White House that has let Russia run roughshod over parts of the old Soviet Empire.

Trump is scheduled to appear at the April 12 New Hampshire Freedom Summit,
 an event in the first-in-the-nation primary state that will showcase 
more than a half-dozen potential GOP presidential candidates.

Sens.
 Ted Cruz of Texas, Rand Paul of Kentucky and Mike Lee of Utah will 
speak, along with former Arkansas governor and Fox News host Mike 
Huckabee, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich and Tennessee Rep. Marsha 
Blackburn.

His first formal appearance on the 
pre-2016 Republican speaking circuit came a week ago at the Conservative
 Political Action Conference.

But
 his message about unemployment and U.S. weakness abroad sputtered 
beneath the weight of a headline-inducing gaffe in which he referred to 
the 39th U.S. president as 'the late, great Jimmy Carter.'

Carter is very much alive.

Trump said Thursday on NBC that Republican leaders want him to run against New York Governor Andrew Cuomo 'badly'

Trump was on the TODAY show to announce that the June 2014 Miss USA event, which will air on NBC, will be held in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.

Trump owns the Miss Universe Organization. Miss USA is America's qualifying pageant for that global competition.

He called the Pelican State's capital 'a place that really wanted us.'

'We had about 12 places that were fighting for the rights, and we just decided that's sort of the home of pageantry, it's sort of the home of the whole beauty thing. They're terrific people, and they're going to put on a great show.'

'Usually we go to Las Vegas. We never fail in Las Vegas,' he said. 'It's great, but we thought we'd move it.'

Trump appeared alongside Miss USA 2013 Erin Brady, who announced that she intended to enter the entertainment industry after her reign is over.

He has said he plans to decide whether or not to run for governor by the end of the week.
