Hope: Using cartilage from Kieran Sorkin¿s ribs, specialist surgeons from Great Ormond Street Hospital will build the ears and graft them to his head

A boy born without any ears is having a pair specially created from his own ribs.

Using cartilage from Kieran Sorkin’s ribs, specialist surgeons from Great Ormond Street Hospital will build the ears and graft them to his head.

The eight-year-old was born deaf with just small lobes where his ears should have been. 

Thanks to several operations and a hearing aid, he has gradually been able to hear. 

Now medics, led by lead clinician for plastic surgery Neil Bulstrode, are helping the youngster by carving cartilage from six of his ribs into the shape of ears - which will be attached during an operation next year.

He will have to have a follow-up operation six months after.

'From the cartilage I will carve a framework in the shape of an ear for both sides,' Mr Bulstrode told the Evening Standard. 

'Then I will place that framework in pockets under the skin, which is sucked down with a vacuum so that the skin conforms to the contours of the ear framework.'

Kieran, from Bushey, Hertfordshire, was born with microtia which effects just one in 100,000 babies on both sides of the head.

He has been teased by other children and his mother Louise said the operation needs to be done before he starts senior school.

She added: 'He wants to look like everyone else and not be asked questions.'

She told The Times: 'Keiran is a 
really special little guy and he works really hard.

'He is always 
trying to make friends but he has found children always asking questions
about it.'

Kieran's older sister Mia, 10, cut 
off her waste-length hair to raise £1,100 for the Jewish Deaf 
Association, which has offered its support to the Sorkin family, as well
as Chai Cancer Care.

Sue Cipin, executive director of the Jewish Deaf Association, said: 'We are delighted to have been able to support the Sorkin family over the years and the girls' kindness and generosity means that we will be able to continue helping other families give the best possible start in life to their deaf children.'
