A five-metre shark has forced surfers and swimmers out of the water at popular Perth beaches as it continues to travel south along the coast.

Aerial patrols first detected the shark, believed to be a Great White, on Wednesday afternoon as it lurked 400 metres from the shoreline at South Cottesloe, south west of Perth.

Surf Lifesaving WA ordered beach-goers out of the water as the Westpac Lifesaver helicopter continued to track the five-metre shark along the coast.

Massive Great White shark spotted off the coast of Perth forces the closure of Cottesloe Beach

The shark is now at Fremantle beach, just off North Mole Drive, and is continuing to swim south.

9NEWS reporter Tracey Vo told local radio that one surfer remained in the water despite the closure of the beach.

There's been several fatal shark attacks near Perth in recent years, including a 64-year-old Perth man who disappeared while swimming off Cottesloe Beach in October 2011. His shredded swimming costume was later found.

The shark sighting comes after the West Australian Government's catch and kill trial program ended earlier this year.

Drum lines were set off five Perth beaches and another two in the South West following a spate of fatal shark attacks in WA, attributed mostly to great whites.

Sharks larger than three metres were destroyed as part of the program.
