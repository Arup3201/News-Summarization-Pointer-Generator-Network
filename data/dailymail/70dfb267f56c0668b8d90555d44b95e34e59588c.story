Tragic: Philip Wood, 56, is thought to have killed wife Sheila, 54, and their daughter Sophie, 27, before shooting himself with the same gun

Deaths: Police found the note by the murder weapon beside his body in the family's rented Costa del Sol villa, respected local newspaper Diario Sur said

Sombre scene: Their bodies were discovered covered by a sheet in their bedrooms

The mother, Sheila, and daughter, Sophie, have been confirmed as Irish.

Officials have so far been unable to confirm where in Ireland Mrs Woods comes from.

Police said they are working on the theory that the deaths, at a property on the Costa Del Sol, were a murder-suicide.

They said there was no sign of any 
struggle at the family's rented £350,000 home in a leafy street on the 
Torrenueva residential estate near the popular Cala de Midis resort a 10
minute drive from Fuengirola.

Autopsies were due to take place this morning in nearby Malaga.

Past: Their British landlord alerted police after discovering them dead when he went to the property to find out why they hadn't paid rent and let himself in with a set of keys

Their British landlord alerted police
after discovering them dead when he went to the property to find out 
why they hadn't paid rent and let himself in with a set of keys.

Last night, a Guardia Civil spokeswoman said the family were renting the property where they were found dead.

'The latest information we have is that the owner of the house had not 
heard from the family for a few days and had not been paid,' she said.

'He went to the house today and when there was no reply at the door, he 
went inside. Inside he saw the man dead on the sofa and immediately 
called the Guardia Civil.

'When officers inspected the house they found the wife and the daughter 
dead in a bedroom. The initial hypothesis at this early stage of the 
investigation is that this was a murder-suicide.'

A friend of the family said: ‘He had a
lot of problems on his back. His daughter was grown-up but her mind was
that of a baby’s and his wife had been ill for some time.

‘He did work in a bank but told me he had changed his job.’

Evidence: Police said there was no sign of any struggle at the family's rented £350,000 home in a leafy street on the Torrenueva residential estate near the popular Cala de Midis resort

Grim: The bodies - believed to be those of a couple and their daughter in her 20s - were discovered by their landlord in this rented apartment

Scene: A shopping basket can be seen outside the front door to the property. There was not believed to be any sign of a struggle inside

Investigation: The Foreign Office has said it is 'urgently' looking into the deaths. Drying racks for washing can be seen outside the building

Neighbours said debt collectors had 
visited the family in recent days.

Several said they had heard shots, 
sparking speculation the bodies may have lain undiscovered for some 
time.

Dutch neighbour Elizabeth Van 
Heyningen, 66, said: ‘The couple have been in my house for a drink.

'They
were both British but I don’t know where from. He seemed very nice. He 
must have been in his late  fifties. He used to work in a Spanish bank 
before becoming an estate agent and then losing his job. I think they 
had run out of money.

Probe: Detectives investigating the triple deaths are pictured inside the property

Horrific: Emergency workers can be seen at the scene

‘He used to drive a BMW and his wife 
had a nice car of her own but then they sold them for a hired Opel they 
used to drive. In recent weeks I hadn’t seen them driving anything.

‘A couple of weeks ago I saw him walking up the hill to his house with heavy bags of shopping.

‘His wife had fallen ill in recent 
months and he often came round asking if I could do anything about 
another neighbour’s barking dog which was upsetting her. The talk round 
here is he killed his wife and daughter and then turned the gun on 
himself.’

Garage owner Kevin Watts, 65, an 
immediate neighbour, said: ‘They lived like hermits. They always kept 
the metal shutters on their windows down.’

Pleasant: Mijas is known for being civilised and family friendly

Expat Suzanne Hughes, 58, added: ‘I 
heard three shots the other day. I put it down at the time to someone 
shooting wild boar. I even joked, “I hope someone’s not being shot”.’

The Department of Foreign Affairs in Dublin confirmed the woman and their daughter were Irish passport holders.

Officials are attempting to contact their next of kin.

The Foreign Office in London said it was 'liaising closely' with the local police and was ready to provide consular assistance.
