BT Sport, 
whose average rating for women’s tennis is just 3,000 viewers, have 
rushed out a somewhat premature advertising campaign with Gareth Bale.

It has the Real Madrid star promoting BT’s Champions League coverage for
 the 2015-16 campaign, despite all Bale’s football for club and country 
being screened by arch-rivals Sky next season.

Suarez Power failure

Bookmakers
 Paddy Power reached a new low with an alleged seven-figure offer to 
serial biter Luis Suarez to wear a branded gumshield in the Uruguay 
World Cup match against Colombia. Paddy Power claim they had agreed a 
deal with Suarez’s advisors before his FIFA ban scuppered the project.

The
 rabid publicists say their connection with Suarez was made through an 
earlier proposed gumshield stunt on his return to football after biting 
Chelsea’s Branislav Ivanovic last year.

Greg Rusedski, crowned Sports Personality of the Year after finishing runner-up in the 1997 US Open, is under scrutiny in his role as coach at the Lawn Tennis Association.

This follows the upset around Rusedski being assigned to look after Britain’s highest-ranked teenager Kyle Edmund last April — yet not being with him in the build-up to Wimbledon, where his charge exited in straight sets in the first round.

Rusedski was playing an exhibition tournament in Liverpool in the four days leading up to 19-year-old Edmund’s big moment at the Championships.

And there is now concern whether busy Rusedski, who has media commitments and is a regular on the seniors circuit, has sufficient time to coach Edmund.

LTA chief executive Michael Downey said after Rusedski’s appointment: ‘It reflects very highly on Greg that he wanted to step up and take on this challenge.’ 

Yet neither Andy Murray nor Tim Henman were too impressed with the choice of Rusedski to guide Edmund, it is understood.

An LTA spokeswoman said: ‘Greg agreed to take part in Liverpool well before he was appointed as Kyle’s coach. Our performance team are working to achieve a level of continuity for Kyle’s coaching situation.’

Meanwhile. Downey is believed to be paying Australian Bob Brett around £250,000 a year — not far short of the CEO’s own salary — to be director of player development when the LTA are involved in a nationwide cost-cutting process which has seen more than 30 jobs lost.

However, Brett and Downey’s combined wages are still less then the obscene £640,000 a year the LTA were paying former CEO Roger Draper.

Chairman Greg Dyke works only part-time for the FA and was entitled to take up an invitation to Wimbledon’s Royal Box on Monday. But somehow it seemed wrong for Dyke to be enjoying lavish All England Club hospitality quite so soon after England’s footballers had let down the nation in Brazil, with the FA chief not prepared to discuss it.

The LTA, who have a poor record with communications chief appointments, have once again, in their wisdom, given this crucial role to someone from outside tennis.

There is a real need at the LTA for a top media operator to make the most of Andy Murray’s golden years. Yet Alex Mawer, recruited from tourism agency Visit England, is much more of a marketing specialist. LTA chief Michael Downey believes marketing is key to revitalising his organisation’s battered image.

Philip Brook, all-powerful chairman of the All England Club, is the force behind the unnecessary policing to ensure all-white clothing regulations are enforced — even to the extent of 1987 singles champion Pat Cash not being allowed to wear his signature check headband in the seniors event. 

There is also disquiet at the way Brook has turned the Royal Box into such a celebrity fest, particularly on the first Saturday when random sporting guests receive invites despite doing nothing noteworthy of late. Brook enjoys having the stars around him, as shown by him sitting next to David Beckham.
