A blogger who claimed the murder of soldier Lee Rigby was a hoax aimed at stirring up anti-Islam hatred was arrested in a 2am raid yesterday.

Christopher Spivey, 51, a tattoo artist from Rochford, Essex, was arrested on suspicion of harassment via social media after police raided his home and took away computer equipment.

Mr Spivey claimed in internet articles that he spent hours researching
 footage of Mr Rigby’s killing and the aftermath to 'prove' that the British 
establishment had faked the murder to incite hatred towards Muslims.

Twisted theory: Christopher Spivey, left, wrote articles on the internet claiming that the murder of Lee Rigby, right, who was run down and then hacked to death in Woolwich, London, last May, was a hoax

It is unclear whether the arrest was made in relation to these articles or another separate case, or cases, of alleged harassment.

In a rambling post uploaded to his blog on Tuesday, Mr Spivey claims that there are eight seconds of footage 'missing' from the CCTV footage that captured the death of Drummer Rigby, who was run down and then hacked to death in Woolwich, London, in May last year.

He goes on to discuss his theory in extensive detail, sharing 'calculations' that he has made of the speed that the car was travelling at when it hit Lee Rigby.

This logic, among other suggestions, shows that the brutal murder was in fact a 'hoax', he claims.

Police involved in the investigation would neither confirm nor deny whether the
 alleged harassment was connected to Lee Rigby’s mother Lyn Rigby and 
stepfather Ian Rigby, who live in Middleton, Manchester.

Among Mr Spivey’s online supporters are David Icke, the former footballer and BBC Grandstand presenter who has become known for his conspiracy theories.

Mr
 Spivey was being held in custody yesterday in Southend, Essex after his arrest, which came about when officers from Essex Police acted on a referral from Greater Manchester Police.

He has since been released on police bail pending further inquiries until September 5.

An Essex Police spokeswoman said: 'A 51-year-old man from Rochford was arrested by Essex Police on suspicion of harassment in the early hours of Wednesday, July 30.

'Hoax': Christopher Spivey uploaded a rambling blog post on the day before his arrest that offered his skewed take on how the events on 22 May last year unfolded, focusing on CCTV stills like the one pictured

'He is at Southend Police Station helping officers with their enquires.

'The arrest relates to an allegation of harassment via social media which has been referred to Essex Police by Greater Manchester Police.'

Fans took to his blog to speculate on the reasons they thought surrounded the arrest. A message posted on the website yesterday claimed Mr Spivey was 'illegally' arrested.

One said: 'They might charge him over the Woolwich hoax.'

Another added: 'If the official Woolwich narrative was true, why would they need to bother a grandad, young mother and her baby at 2 o’clock in the morning?'

Mr Spivey was also recently critical of Lib Dem deputy prime minister Nick Clegg, portraying him as Hitler on his Facebook page.

Killers Michael Adebowale, 23, and Michael Adebolajo, 29 were both sentenced to life in February for the brutal murder of Lee Rigby.

Adebolajo received a while life term while Adebowale will serve a minimum of 45 years.

The pair ran 25-year-old Fusilier Rigby down in a car before attacking him with a meat cleaver and knives in a frenzied attack.

Both pleaded not guilty and claimed to be 'soldiers of Allah' and motivated by the plight of Muslims
