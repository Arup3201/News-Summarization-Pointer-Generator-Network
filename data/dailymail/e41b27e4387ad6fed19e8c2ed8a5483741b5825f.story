Manchester United are willing to listen to offers for goalkeeper Sam Johnstone.

The 21-year-old, who has played for England from Under 16 to Under 20 level, has found it impossible to break into United's first-team following the arrival of David De Gea in 2011.

With former Barcelona goalkeeper Victor Valdes signing an 18-month contract earlier this month to become their back-up, pushing Anders Lindegaard into the reserves, Johnstone has fallen even further down the pecking order.

Victor Valdes has come in to the club on a free transfer and is expected to make his debut against Cambridge

He joined Preston on loan last week, where his father Glenn played in goal during the early 1990s, for the remainder of the season.

Johnstone only signed a three-and-a-half year contract extension in January last year, but United are open to offers to sign the player on a permanent basis in the summer.

Johnstone won the FA Youth Cup with Manchester United in 2011 and was part of England's Under 17 side which won the European Championship in 2010.

He has twice made it on the bench for United's senior side, against Stoke in the Capital One Cup and West Ham in the Barclays Premier League, and David Moyes saw the potential to offer him a long-term contract.

But United manager Louis Van Gaal does not see a future for him at the club and is ready to let him leave.

Johnstone, who joined United's academy in 2009, has had loan spells at Scunthorpe, Walsall, Yeovil and Doncaster Rovers.
