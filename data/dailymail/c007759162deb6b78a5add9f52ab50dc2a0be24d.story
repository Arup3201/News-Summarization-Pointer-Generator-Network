An artist has used scrap metal from cars to create iconic Sci-Fi film characters, selling them for up to £5,000.

What started as a hobby for Mai Sudjai ten years ago has become a lucrative business, making hundreds of sculptures for customers all over the world.

Metalsmiths at the Kreatworks workshop in Bangkok, Thailand spend up to two months making the 8ft-tall sculptures that include Terminator, Predator, Robocop and Alien.

Scrap no more: Mai Sudjai and his metalsmiths create iconic Sci-Fi film characters such as a Transformer using scrap metal from cars

Each one is welded together from the body parts of BMWs, Mercs, Nissans, Hondas, Toyotas and Isuzus.

As demand for the pieces grew Mr Sudjai set up a workshop and now employs more than a dozen people to create the sculptures.

The artists collect parts - including
carburettors, chains, and exhaust pipes - from scrap Japanese cars 
before rinsing off dust and grease.

They then set each part alight to burn off petrol then coat them in lacquer for protection.

Each piece of steel is then welded together, while aluminum parts are screwed into place. The finished sculptures weigh up to 1100lbs.

The firm has made hundreds of 
'steampunk' models as well as famous characters Alien, Queen Alien, 
Species, Predator, Hellboy, Optimus and BumbleBee from Transformers, 
T-800 from Terminator.

They have also made Star Wars favourites Darth Vader, Battle Droid, R2D2, Storm Trooper and Boba Fett.

One of the metalsmiths Krittayakorn Chaijit said they receive commissions from around the world and have shipped finished pieces to the UK, United States, Australia, Russia, Japan, Canada, New Zealand, Poland, Germany and Switzerland.

He said: ‘Our artists are passionate about film characters. We want to recreate them in our own style from recycled metal.

‘We
try to retain the specific characteristic of the car parts although we 
do a lot of cutting, hammering and welding to make sure that we get the 
right shape for the character's features.

‘If a car part size is exactly what we need then we just use it as a whole.’

Mr Chaijit said making Pirates of the Caribbean star Johnny Depp was the most fun.

He said: ‘Jack Sparrow is a great character to make. He is such a scruffy yet charismatic character with so many accessories.

‘We thought making a metal sculpture of him would be an interesting break from Alien and Predator projects we do.

‘Our artist created his face by hammering and welding metal sheets.

‘Each hair lock and beard were made from individual metal slings and wires.

‘We had fun giving him lots of individually made metal accessories, such as a sword, a gun and liquor bottle.’

The sculptures can be bought from kreatworks.com.
