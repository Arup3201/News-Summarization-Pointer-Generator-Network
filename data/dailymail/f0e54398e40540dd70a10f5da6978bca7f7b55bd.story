A jury in the phone hacking trial of former News International chief executive Rebekah Brooks and Downing Street spin doctor Andy Coulson will be chosen today.

Potential jurors were yesterday warned they faced ‘significant disruption’ to their personal and professional lives because the trial is expected to last up to six months, until next Easter.

They were told not to carry out their own research into the high-profile case, or to use Twitter or other social networking sites to discuss it.

Brooks and Coulson, both 45, watched silently from the glass-walled dock of the Old Bailey as a panel of potential jurors were given the barest details of the allegations against them and six other defendants.

The trial is expected to be one of the longest in recent British legal history.

A group of 80 potential jurors were gathered in a bid to find 12 who could hear the case in its entirety.

The trial into phone hacking will see some of the country’s top legal minds go head-to-head in the courtroom with costs expected to run into millions of pounds.

Andrew Edis QC will be leading the 
prosecution against the defendants. He is already well-known for heading the successful prosecution 
earlier this year of Chris Huhne and his ex-wife Vicky Pryce for 
conspiracy to pervert the course of justice over a 2003 driving case. He has also worked on a string of 
high-profile murder cases - including the ‘lady in the lake’ case where 
Gordon Park was found guilty of killing his wife 30 years after dumping 
her body.

He will face Jonathan Laidlaw QC who works in the same chambers off Fleet Street and is the lead counsel for Rebekah Brooks. He predominantly practices in fraud and business law and has successfully represented numerous companies and their directors against cahrges brought by the Health and Safety Executive.

Meanwhile Timothy Langdale QC, known for his presence in the court room, will be representing Coulson.

Defence QCs usually earn about £850-an-hour and often have up to seven juniors assisting them at £400-an-hour. This means a five-month trial with a 
minimum of six hours a day in court could result in a total defence bill
 of £4.4million for the case alone.

The cost to the public purse of the 
case - which includes the use of a court room for several months, taking up the time of court staff and a judge, as well as the prosecution fees - is also expected to
 run into the hundreds of thousands of pounds.

Judge Mr Justice Saunders told them: 
‘To sit on a jury for this long is a significant disruption to people’s 
lives and we do appreciate that.’

Of the 80 potential jurors, 48 were excused because of commitments including holidays or work.

From the remaining 32, 12 will be 
chosen at random today to serve as the jury.

The prosecution will then 
open its case.

Brooks and Coulson, both former editors of the News of 
the World, are accused of being part of a six-year conspiracy to hack 
phones of celebrities, politicians and public figures at the now defunct
 Sunday tabloid.

The 
paper’s former head of news Ian Edmondson, 44, and its ex-managing 
editor Stuart Kuttner, 73, allegedly conspired with them to illegally 
access voicemails between October 2000 and August 2006. All four deny 
the charges.

Brooks, 
who resigned from News International in July 2011, denies charges 
relating to phone hacking, conspiracy to commit misconduct in public 
office and conspiracy to pervert the course of justice.

Coulson, who quit his role working for David Cameron in Downing Street in January 2011, faces charges relating  to his time at the News of the World.

He denies the phone hacking accusation and  two charges of conspiracy  to commit misconduct in  public office.

The newspaper’s former royal editor, Clive Goodman, 56, has also pleaded not guilty to conspiracy to commit misconduct in public office.

Brooks’s husband, racehorse trainer Charlie Brooks, 50, denies conspiring to pervert the course of justice, as does her former assistant Cheryl Carter, 49, and News International’s ex-head of security Mark Hanna, 50.

In court: Cheryl Carter, former personal assistant to Rebekah Brooks, also arrived at the court for the start of the trial this morning

Rebekah Brooks between January 1, 2004, and January 31, 2012, conspired with others and persons unknown to commit misconduct in public office.

Brooks, between February 9, 2006, and October 16, 2008, conspired with others and with persons unknown to commit misconduct in public office. 

Conspiring to pervert the course of justice: Brooks and Cheryl Carter between July 6, 2011, and July 9, 2011, conspired together to do a series of acts which had a tendency to and were intended to pervert the course of public justice, namely permanently to remove seven boxes of archived material from the archive of News International.

Rebekah Brooks, Charles Brooks and Mark Hanna, between July 15, 2011, and July 19, 2011, conspired together and with others and persons unknown to do an act or a series of acts which had a tendency to and were intended to pervert the course of justice, namely to conceal documents, computers, and other electronic equipment from officers of the Metropolitan police who were investigating allegations of phone hacking and corruption of public officials in relation to the News of the World and The Sun newspapers.
