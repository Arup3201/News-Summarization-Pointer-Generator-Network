NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden has defended his disclosure of top-secret U.S. spying programs in an online chat as he attacks President Obama over his broken promises.

As he answered readers' questions online, Snowden lambasted U.S. officials for calling him a traitor and said the government won't silence him by 'jailing or murdering' him.

'The US Government is not going to be able to cover this up by jailing or murdering me,' he said in the live chat, which was launched on Monday. 'Truth is coming, and it cannot be stopped.'

The Guardian hosted the online chat with Snowden, who has been in hiding in Hong Kong since fleeing the U.S., as reporter Glenn Greenwald received and posted Snowden's answers.

Among his responses, he said he waited until after the election to release the information as he had been hopeful that Obama would make good on his promises about civil liberties.

In fact, Snowden said, privacy and civil liberties have actually worsened since the re-election.

'Shortly after assuming power, [Obama] closed the door on investigating systemic violations of law, deepened and expanded several abusive programs, and refused to spend the political capital to end the kind of human rights violations like we see in Guantanamo, where men still sit without charge,' he said.

He said he saw no option but the flee the country as the administration would never have given him a fair trial.

'The U.S. Government, just as they did with other whistleblowers, immediately and predictably destroyed any possibility of a fair trial at home, openly declaring me guilty of treason,' he said. 'That's not justice.'

But Snowden added that he did not think it was too late - that the leaks gave the president a chance 'for a return to sanity, constitutional policy, and the rule of law rather than men'.

On his escape to Hong Kong: 'The U.S. Government immediately and predictably destroyed any possibility of a fair trial at home... That's not justice. It would be foolish to volunteer yourself to it if you can do more good outside of prison than in it.'

On leaking information about the U.S. tracking foreign countries: 'Congress hasn't declared war on the countries but without asking for public permission, NSA is running network operations against them that affect millions of innocent people. And for what? So we can have secret access to a computer in a country we're not even fighting?'

On being silenced: 'The U.S. government is not going to be able to cover this up by jailing or murdering me.'

On why he leaked the information: 'Obama's campaign promises gave me faith that he would lead us toward fixing problems. Unfortunately, he closed the door on investigating systemic violations of law, deepened and expanded several abusive programs, and refused... to end human rights violations.'

On beating NSA surveillance: 'Encryption works. Properly implemented strong crypto systems are one of the few things that you can rely on. Unfortunately, endpoint security is so terrifically weak that NSA can frequently find ways around it.'

On spying for China: 'Ask yourself: if I were a Chinese spy, why wouldn't I have flown directly into Beijing? I could be living in a palace petting a phoenix by now.'

On when he decided to act: 'There was no single moment. It was seeing a continuing litany of lies from senior officials to Congress.'

He called for Obama to set up a special committee to review the surveillance programs and set up a special investigator to review presidents' policies for wrongdoing.

He added that he did not reveal any 
U.S. operations against what he called legitimate military targets, but 
instead showed that the NSA is hacking civilian infrastructure like 
universities and businesses.

U.S. officials say the data-gathering programs were legal and operated under court supervision.

Snowden explained his claim that from his desk, he could 'wiretap' any phone call or email - a claim top intelligence officials have denied.

'If an NSA, FBI, CIA, DIA, etc. analyst has access to query raw SIGINT (signals intelligence) databases, they can enter and get results for anything they want,' he said. 'Phone number, email, user id, cell phone handset id (IMEI), and so on - it's all the same.'

Director of National Intelligence James Clapper has said that the kind of data that can be accessed and who can access it is severely limited.

His online chat comes after China 
denied that Snowden is working for them after former US Vice-President 
Dick Cheney branded the leaker a 'traitor and possible Chinese spy'.

Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said at a daily briefing today, 'This is sheer nonsense,' when asked if Snowden worked for China.

Snowden himself added in the web chat: 'Ask yourself: if I were a Chinese spy, why wouldn't I have flown directly into Beijing? I could be living in a palace petting a phoenix by now.'

Several nations, including U.S. 
allies, have reacted angrily to revelations by the ex-CIA employee that U.S. authorities had tapped the servers of internet 
companies for personal data.

National defense: Former Vice President Dick Cheney spoke on Fox News Sunday in Washington about the need for surveillance

'We believe the United States should 
pay attention to the international community's concerns and demands and 
give the international community the necessary explanation,' Hua said.

The Chinese government has previously
 not commented directly on the case, simply repeating the government's 
standard line that China is one of the world's biggest victims of 
hacking attacks.

A senior source with ties to the 
Communist Party leadership said Beijing was reluctant to jeopardise 
recently improved ties with Washington.

Cheney said how the controversial surveillance methods used by the NSA could 
have prevented the September 
11 attacks and said the revelations have done 'enormous 
damage' to America's security.

Speaking on Fox News Sunday with Chris Wallace, Cheney took credit for crafting the program of data collection, saying that he 'worked with [former Director of 
National Intelligence] Mike Hayden when we set this program up.'

'Traitor': According to Cheney, Snowden 
could be leaking U.S. security secrets to China. Supporters in Hong Kong have come out strongly in defense of 
the former CIA employee, as pictured

'As everybody who's been associated with the program's said, if we had 
had this before 9/11, when there were two terrorists in San Diego - two 
hijackers - had been able to use that program, that capability, against 
that target, we might well have been able to prevent 9/11,' Cheney told Wallace.

In the webchat, Snowden added: 'Journalists should ask: since these programs began operation shortly after September 11th, how many terrorist attacks were prevented SOLELY by information derived from this suspicion-less surveillance that could not be gained via any other source?

'Then ask how many individual communications were ingested to acheive that, and ask yourself if it was worth it.'

Cheney ridiculed the notion that the NSA 
was listening in to personal calls of ordinary Americans.

'The allegation is not that we get all this personal information on 
Aunt Fanny or Chris Wallace, that's not the way it works,' he said.

Anger: Snowden said civil liberties had worsened ever since President Obama was re-elected last year

'What
 information [was collected]?' he said. 'And the answer is phone numbers
 and who contacted who. But we don’t have any names associated with it. 
It’s just a big bag of numbers that’s been collected.'

Of Snowden, Cheney said the breach of security was one of the worst in history.

'I think he's a traitor. I think it's 
one of the worst occasions, in my memory, of somebody with access to 
classified information doing enormous damage to the national security 
interests of the United States,' he said.

He suggested that Snowden, who is thought to have fled to Hong Kong, could be working with the Chinese government.

'I am very, very worried that he still 
has additional information that he hasn't released yet, that the Chinese
 would welcome the opportunity and are probably willing to offer 
immunity - or sanctuary, if you will - in exchange for what he 
presumably knows or doesn't know,' said Cheney.
