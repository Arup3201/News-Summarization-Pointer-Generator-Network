Warning: Sir Michael Wilshaw said teachers are being forced to battle against an anti-learning culture

Thousands of children from dysfunctional homes should be taken from their families and put in boarding schools, the head of Ofsted claimed yesterday.

Sir Michael Wilshaw, chief inspector of schools, said drastic intervention was needed to help youngsters whose futures were being blighted by their parents’ low expectations and chaotic lifestyles.

He warned that too many pupils were coming to school from an ‘anti-learning culture’ amid a ‘backdrop of lost standards, values and ambitions’.

The problem was being compounded by parents failing to enforce boundaries and absent fathers in particular who, he said, should be condemned by society for their failure to support their children. Fathers needed to see raising their children as the ‘right and manly’ thing to do.

Sir Michael, a former head teacher, spoke out as he launched a major review aimed at tackling the achievement gap between rich and poor students.

In an interview with LBC Radio presenter Julia Hartley-Brewer, he said the inquiry would consider whether some children should be taken from their parents on educational grounds.

He said: ‘There are some dysfunctional families where children…come to school completely unprepared to be able to work.

‘I think the Government have said there are 30,000 of these families, and there may be more.

‘Hopefully one of the things we can look at (in this review) is to say some of these children need to be lifted from the home…at a very early stage and put into boarding education where they can be looked after, cared for and loved.’

Sir Michael suggested that Ministers were already considering similar plans, adding: ‘I know the Government is interested in this.’

He also called on fathers to play a far greater role in the lives of their children following divorce or separation from the mother.

‘I would say to absent dads, get involved in your children’s lives,’ he said. ‘If you don’t, you should be condemned.’

Earlier, he warned the National College annual conference in Birmingham that his review – which will report in May next year – will look for ‘radical solutions’ to narrow achievement gaps.

Referring to a newspaper article that highlighted the lack of ambition in white, working class areas, he said that historically there used to be a ‘real respect for education’ in these communities.

He said: ‘Too many children and young people come to school against a backdrop of lost standards, values and ambitions.’

Under Labour, ministers had wanted boarding schools to admit pupils in the care of social services. It was hoped that 3,000 would eventually be placed. But it was revealed in 2008 that only 25 had been – and eight dropped out.

Ex-Government adviser Sir Cyril Taylor said Left-wing social workers had scuppered the scheme.

A Department for Education spokesman said: ‘Placement in boarding schools is an option but would be at the discretion of the local authority. Every case would be assessed on the individual needs of the child.’
