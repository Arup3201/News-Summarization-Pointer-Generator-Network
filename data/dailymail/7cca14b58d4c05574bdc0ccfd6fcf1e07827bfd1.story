The multimillionaire mother who gave up her Chinese daughter for re-adoption and cut her out of her $250million estate had adopted and given up another child from China, it was revealed today.

The New York Daily News reported that widowed mother Christine Svenningsen had adopted a boy she called Eric from China shortly after her husband’s death in 1997.

But court papers show that after his arrival to suburban Westchester County in New York, Eric was given up for adoption, and was taken in by a family living in New Jersey because the mother-of-six said that another baby was more than she could handle.

Family: Christine Svenningsen of Westchester, pictured with her five biological children, adopted a baby girl from China and later gave her up for re-adoption

Terms: On May 6, 1996, the Svenningsens signed an adoption agreement stating that they would not abandon Emily or transfer or have her re-adopted, and that she would be deemed a biological child

The Daily News, citing a deposition 
in 2009, reports that Svenningsen first adopted a girl from China, named
Emily. She deposed that she went to China after that to adopt Eric.

Svenningsen, 55, already had five biological children with her husband.

After being asked what she did with 
baby Eric, Svenningsen deposed: ‘He was adopted by a person in New 
Jersey,’ though the court papers do not reveal the date of either 
Svenningsen’s adoption nor the New Jersey family’s re-adoption.

She said: ‘I couldn’t handle seven children,’ according to court papers.

The millionaire mother collects 
properties in the Long Island Sound and renovates them, though, as the 
Daily News notes, most of the houses remain empty throughout the year.

In 1996, Svenningsen and her husband 
John adopted a baby girl, who they named Emily Fuqui Svenningsen, to add
to their brood of five biological children.

Right before the adoption was finalized, they had another biological child and husband John was diagnosed with cancer.

According to court documents, on May 6, 1996, the Svenningsens signed an adoption agreement stating they would not abandon Emily or 'transfer or have [her] re-adopted', and that she would be deemed 'a biological child'.

The agreement also stated that Emily had the right to inherit the estate of her adopted parents, who had established a pair of trusts for their children, as well as one meant solely for Emily, according to ABC.

In December 2004, seven years after her husband died from cancer, Mrs Svenningsen put Emily up for adoption and surrendered her to Spence-Chapin Services to Families and Children, an adoption agency in New York.

She said that Emily was a difficult child and was unable to bond with the family. But the adoptive family suggest that Christine 
may have wanted to terminate Emily's interest in her husband's estate. 

On May 18, 2006, Maryann Campbell and her husband Fred Cass formally adopted Emily after first expressing interest when Mrs Svenningsen brought Emily to their boarding school catered for children with special needs.

Christine placed Emily at the Devereux Glenholme School 
based upon a diagnosis of reactive attachment disorder, though the staff at 
Devereux did not concur with that diagnosis, according to court documents, which also noted that Emily thrived with her new family.

Land: Christine Svenningsen, who was married to a party-goods magnate, sold Belden Island for $3.95million and Jepson Island for nearly $2million

Private: The islands are part of the Thimble Islands off Branford, which have attracted celebrities and the wealthy for generations

The couple had no idea about the money legally owed to their newly adopted daughter from the trust, but eventually learned that John Svenningsen had arranged to provide for Emily’s educational and medical needs.

They were sent a letter by Christine’s lawyers stating that Emily’s trusts totaled $842,397.

When they later learned the estate was worth more than $250million, the couple sued on behalf of the Chinese girl.

Westchester County Surrogate’s Court said that John Svenningsen meant to provide for all of his children, both biological and adopted.

Mrs Svenningsen and her five biological children appealed, but last week the court ruled in Emily's favor.

'It cannot be overly emphasized that Christine’s unilateral surrender of Emily for adoption more than eight years after the decedent and Christine adopted her was not foreseeable at the time the will, and the trust documents were drafted and executed by the decedent,' Judge Leonard Austin wrote.

'John Svenningsen expressed an intention to include his adopted child in the absence of any reason to believe that his status as the parent of Emily would be terminated by her subsequent adoption many years after his death.'

Christine Svenningsen, who has since remarried and has spent about $33 million buying ten of the so-called Thimble Islands in the Long Island Sound, could not be reached for comment.

She married John G Chiarella, Jr, a landscaping entrepreneur who manages her islands, in July 2010.
