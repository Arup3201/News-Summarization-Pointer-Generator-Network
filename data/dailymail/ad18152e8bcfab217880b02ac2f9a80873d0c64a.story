A convenience store owner charged with triple murder after he allegedly deliberately lit a fire in his shop in order to claim insurance will have extra charges laid against him after his court appearance on Tuesday.

Adeel Khan, 44, is accused of igniting the blast which obliterated his shop in Rozelle, in Sydney's inner-west, and killed Bianka O'Brien, 31, her one-year-old son Jude, and neighbour Chris Noble, 27.

During a brief mention at Sydney's Central Local court on Tuesday the court heard that Khan is now accused of four additional charges, including recklessly lighting a fire, over the explosion.

Chris Noble, 27, was also killed in the blast when he became trapped in the building above the shop

The blaze obliterated the convenience store and surrounding building, forcing emergency crews to search through the debris 'brick-by-brick'

He's now accused of committing 29 offences in total including three counts of murder, two counts of attempted murder and three counts of manslaughter.

The charges also include 17 offences relating to property damage, including one of setting a fire for a financial gain. 

The family of Chris Noble, who was killed in the inferno, attended court on Tuesday. His mother Liz was in attendance as well as a number of other family members.

The blast took place in the early hours of September 4 last year, was so forceful it was heard in nearby suburbs and shattered windows along Darling Street, where the store was located. 

It gave way to a painstaking search operation for emergency services who battled the threat of the surrounding brick walls around the site collapsing.

Crews spent hours combing through the debris 'brick-by-brick' to recover the bodies of the Rozelle residents - Bianka and Jude survived by husband and father John O'Brien, and Chris, whose roommates managed to escape the blaze.

According to documents discovered by police in Khan's Greenacre home, the 44-year-old was significantly behind on his bills at the time of the explosion and had last year increased the value of his store's insurance from $175,000 to $225,000. 

Khan allegedly told police he was the victim of an armed robbery, claiming three people had stolen thousands of dollars from him, tied his hands and covered his eyes, before pouring petrol on the shop floor.

He was originally due at court in October but has been in in Royal Prince Alfred Hospital with serious injuries since the explosion.
