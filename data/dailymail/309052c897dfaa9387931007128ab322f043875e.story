Toronto Mayor Rob Ford has denied allegations that he was filmed smoking crack cocaine, his lawyer has said.

Reporters for the Toronto Star, a rival Canadian newspaper, andÂ Gawker Media, a U.S. media outlet, said they had seen a video that appears to show Ford smoking crack.

The lawyer, Dennis Morris, told the Toronto Sun that the mayor is denying 'any such allegation.'

Questioned: Toronto mayor Rob Ford speaks to the media as he leaves his home today

The video is allegedly being shopped around for $100,000 by people said to be involved in the drug trade.

Deputy Mayor Doug Holyday said he has 
not spoken with Ford since the allegations surfaced, but he told 
reporters he stands by the mayor, according to Reuters.

'Certainly, at this point, we all know
that videos can be altered and we certainly know that drug dealers 
can't be trusted,' he said at Toronto City Hall. 'So I don't know what 
we're dealing with here, and until we do, I don't really have much to 
say.'

The mayor and Morris did not immediately return Reuters' requests for comment.

The MailOnline is also awaiting a comment from his office.

'We're just trying to see whether or 
not such a video exists and whether or not any video has been doctored 
or altered,' Morris told the Toronto Sun.

Asked if Ford planned legal action, Morris said it is at the 'bottom rung of the ladder' now.

The Toronto Star said that it stands 
by its reporting and that the story is just one piece of a broader 
investigative report about Ford it has been working on for months.

'This isn't a story that we're going to report lightly,' said Robyn Doolittle, one of two Toronto

Star reporters who said they watched the video three times.

'This is part of an ongoing 
investigation that myself and a colleague, Kevin Donovan, have been 
working on for months,' Doolittle said.

She added: 'The Toronto Star has a 
high bar that we always make sure we meet before we run something, 
especially when it comes to this mayor.'

Ford, who took office more than two 
years ago with a promise to 'stop the gravy train' at city hall, has 
sparked controversy by skipping council meetings to coach high-school 
football and engaging in a confrontation outside his home with a 
reporter, among other things.

He was briefly ordered out of office 
in 2012 after he was found guilty of conflict of interest but won the 
appeal and was allowed to finish his four-year term.

Ford has not been seen in public since the allegations surfaced late on Thursday.
