A poll of 1,000 professional workers has revealed 19 per cent of Australian men blame women's 'lack of ambition' for stopping them reaching the top of their profession and taking leadership roles.

Interestingly, 13 per cent of women also agreed with their male counterparts in the survey by workplace consultant Positive Leaders.

The study showed that most men think it's women who are responsible for themselves not reaching the top of their professions, with family commitments also cited as a main cause, along with a lack of professional drive.

Further, 60 per cent of the men surveyed believe women do have equal career opportunities - something only 33 per cent of women agreed with, reported The Australian.

Women blamed juggling a work-life balance for preventing them from nabbing top positions, with 83 per cent seeing it as the biggest challenge, something about 66 per cent of men agreed with.

Other findings included close to one in 10 male workers believing men perform leadership roles better, something only 6 per cent of women agreed with.

About 16 per cent of men and women saw a lack of qualifications and experience as a barrier holding back, while 25 per cent of women favoured measures to help their careers, in contrast to 61 per cent wanting more flexibility 38 per cent wanting more help at home.

Federal Sex Discrimination Commissioner Elizabeth Broderick and Screen Australia chairman Glen Boreham have both hit out at the poll's findings claiming women do not lack ambition

But Federal Sex Discrimination Commissioner Elizabeth Broderick hit out at the findings on Wednesday, saying there was no evidence to support women lacked ambition.

'What most women want is to build a strong career while caring for those they love. Perhaps their ambitions do not fit the ideal worker model as well as men's do,' she said.

Ms Broderick said this model needed to change and not women, with many organisations favouring '24/7' employees with no other commitments.

She added that many workplaces had been designed with men in mind and not women and while this framework had failed female workers, it was also letting down male employees who wanted to be involved fathers and increasingly as the population ages, support their elderly parents.

Despite women making up close to half of the workforce, just 3.5 per cent are chief executive officers, only 18 per cent represent directors in the top 200 companies listed on the stock exchange and more than a third of the listed companies have no female directors.

Echoing the sentiments of Ms Broderick, Screen Australia chairman and former IBM managing director Glen Boreham said he did not believe women lacked ambition in their professional careers.

'I think it's about the overreach of the old boys' club,' he said on Wednesday.

Mr Boreham said traditionally, the ideal worker had no kids or elderly parents who could take their attention from work.

He also said there was a notion that if an employee was not seen at the office from 8am to 5pm they were seen as slacking off and anyone working flexibly, regardless of gender, was also seen as not fulfilling their workplace obligations.

In contrast Mr Boreham said a diverse workplace was better for business, with different opinions aid problem solving.

Challenging outdated notions, he believes when an employee feels trusted and able to balance with work and family life, they will often make an put in extra work when needed.

Positive Leaders partner Michelle McQuaid said the poll proved that women it was pointless for women to try and follow their male colleagues' workplace behaviours.

Ms McQuaid, whose clients include Amex, IMB, NAB and Crown Casion, said companies were moving away from trying to 'fix' women by making them more masculine and assertive, but rather opting for a focus on 'feminine traits' such as empathy, patience, flexibility and collaboration in senior management and the value these can bring.
