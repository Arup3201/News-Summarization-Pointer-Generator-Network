Simon Cowell raised fresh questions about the state of his relationship with fiancée Mezhgan Hussainy, after admitting he doesn't know if they are still engaged.

The music mogul added fuel to speculation the pair are having problems.

In an awkward phone interview with notorious DJ Howard Stern in America, he struggled to explain the state of the relationship.

Are they or aren't they? Simon Cowell told DJ Howard Stern that he was 'not sure' if he was still engaged to Mezhgan Hussainy, seen here with him in March 2010, the month after they became betrothed

Asked if he was engaged, the 51-year-old said he was 'not sure'.

Stern also said to Cowell: 'You seem embarrassed by the women you date, and I'll tell you why, they are lovely women, but yet you won't talk about about them.

'I'm a married man and if someone asks me a question about her I am proud to admit I have a relationship.'

Cowell replied: 'If we were having this conversation off the radio I could have a normal conversation.'

Stern then asked: 'Why is the question "are you engaged?" so painful to you?'

Is it all over? Simon and Mezhgan were last snapped together in public seven months ago

The DJ and co-host asked why Cowell went to the pretence of having an engagement if he did not plan to marry.

Clearly annoyed, Cowell spoke of their betrothal in past tense as he insisted the it 'wasn't a pretence of an engagement' but said he would only discuss the situation further.

His response comes 18 months after he announced his engagement to the 38-year-old make-up artist.

Confused: Howard Stern, seen here with wife Beth, made Cowell squirm as he questioned why he did not want to talk about his relationship

Cowell and make-up artist Miss Hussainy have been together for almost two years, and were initially inseparable.

They became engaged after a whirlwind romance and Cowell spoke publicly of his love for the Afghan-born beauty - even suggesting he would like children with her.

His engagement and talk of children came as a surprise because he had long said he had no desire to wed or have babies.

But in recent months the couple have been rarely seen together and his mother Julie is even reported to have revealed the pair had taken a break.

And in the latest issue of the American GQ he ruled out having kids and said: 'Truthfully, with the schedule, the crazy hours, I don't think it would work... With the way I live my life, I wouldn't have the patience. I'd sort of want people born at the age of 10.'

Spokesman Max Clifford said: 'He likes to keep (his relationship) private. In terms of the relationship, it is long distance. He is back in England at the moment, and when he goes back she will be doing things. When he goes back to the States, she will be doing stuff. To my knowledge they are not having any problems.'

Yesterday, his spokeswoman said: 'Simon was just making it clear he doesn't discuss his relationships.'

The star also confessed to having a 'threesome' when he was younger and dating Denise Richards when she was 
heavily pregnant with ex-husband Charlie Sheen's child.

Discussing his ménage-a-trois, he 
recalled: 'Do you mean like a threesome? Yeah, years and years ago... I 
mean a long, long time ago, I was with these two girls and ended up in 
bed. It was cool. It was a lot of fun.'

Date or group dinner? Cowell and Denise Richards appeared to differ over the definition of their meeting

He also said he was set up with former Bond girl Richards in 2005, when she was pregnant with her daughter Lola... although he mistakenly called her 'Denise Lewis' before being corrected by Stern.

He said: 'We arranged to meet at a hotel polo lounge. She turned up eight months pregnant and had a dog in her handbag.'

When asked if her pregnancy put him off, he said: 'A little bit. But she is gorgeous. I liked her a lot, I think she's cute, funny, a bit of a wacko...but I like that. She's a great girl.'

However, Richards wrote on her Twitter last night she didn't see their meeting as a 'date'.

She wrote: 'I was at a group dinner 8mo pregnant not sure how that's considered a date, news to me! If I was being set up I didn't know it!

'S**t I wish I knew that it was a date!!! He's a hot piece of a*s!'

Cowell was also asked about what contraception he used and described condoms as 'something you wore when you were 17 or something'.

When asked what contraceptive methods he used, he replied: 'There are other alternative methods, I can talk to you about them Howard.'

X Factor USA starts on September 21 at 8pm on Fox.
