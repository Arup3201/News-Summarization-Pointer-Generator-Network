Eric Pickles insisted the Government should be 'very,very,very reluctant' to legislate to regulate the press

A cabinet minister broke ranks ahead of the Leveson report into media standards yesterday  to insist the Government should be ‘very, very, very reluctant’ to legislate to regulate the press.

Communities Secretary Eric Pickles said it was right that the media was already working towards an improved system to offer recourse to people with legitimate complaints in the aftermath of the phone hacking scandal.

His intervention opens up a growing divide between the Conservatives and Labour over the future of media regulation.

Labour’s deputy leader Harriet Harman yesterday indicated the party is backing at least an ‘underpinning’ in law for a new regulatory model.

Miss Harman, who also holds the opposition brief for culture, media and sport, appeared to dismiss efforts by editors and proprietors to draw up proposals for a new regulator with greater powers to fine erring publications, including fines.

‘I think it’s disappointing of the newspapers to say we want a status quo because the status quo has failed,’ she said.

Despite David Cameron’s insistence that ministers should not be seen to pre-empt the Leveson report, due next month, Mr Pickles joined senior Conservatives including London Mayor Boris Johnson and culture committee chairman John Whittingdale in opposing any statutory system.

‘I think it is really massively important to ensure we have freedom of press in this country. Some of the characteristics of the British press - it is good at exposing corruption and it is good at going to places where other press wouldn’t,’ the Communities Secretary said.

‘I think it was Thomas Jefferson who said that for a free society to operate, then the “river of a free press had to flow without restriction”.

‘I think, given that the press are looking towards finding ways, the end result of offering a good way that people who have a legitimate complaint can find recourse, then that is right.

‘We should be very, very, very reluctant to take on legislation. It’s a balance and my view is that we should always balance in favour of a free press.’

Mr Pickles’ remarks, to the Sky News Murnaghan programme, were seen as the clearest indication yet of the Cabinet’s thinking on the Leveson report.

His public intervention was all the more surprising, given that the Prime Minister urged Tory cabinet colleagues at a private meeting last Thursday not to say anything that might be taken as pre-empting the government’s response.

Miss Harman, speaking on the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show, insisted that there had to be some kind of statutory underpinning because the Press had failed to reform itself.

‘I don’t think self-regulation could be, should be given another chance. And obviously Lord Leveson has heard a great many revelations from the McCanns, the Dowlers, the Watsons,’ she said.

‘It’s clear that business as usual cannot sustain. There is not a proper press complaints system which ensures that where the press get it wrong, the individual can complain and it will be independently looked at.’

She added: ‘We don’t want any inhibition on press freedom. I mean I’ve been in opposition long enough to have a view that if the government were to control the press, I mean that’s terrible. I’ve always argued for press freedom.

‘But I think that... we may need a statute to underpin a truly independent press complaints system, a bit like the independent system that deals with complaints against solicitors, so that it’s independent of government but also you don’t have them judging their own cases.’

Miss Harman claimed there was ‘every possibility of getting cross-party agreement’ on the issue. ‘I mean we need to have a cool head here. We need to look at what Leveson proposes and hopefully take it forward if it’s sensible and proportionate, but the status quo is not acceptable,’ she added.

Lord Black, chairman of the Press Standards Board of Finance, told peers last week that it would be possible to bring in a new, tighter form of independent regulation within three months, but statutory legislation would take three years, and might face a legal challenge.

Professor Brian Cathcart, of Hacked Off, a campaign for press reform, said: ‘We welcome Labour’s clear and unequivocal commitment to support what Lord Justice Leveson proposes, as long as it is sensible and proportionate.

‘Labour recognises, as we do, that after fifty years of failed self-regulation and the revelations of the last 12 months, the status quo is simply no longer an option.

‘Victims of hacking, harassment and bullying by national newspapers now hope that the Government will seek cross-party agreement for the establishment of a new independent regulator, underpinned by statute. The days of newspaper editors acting as judge and jury over their own misdemeanours are over.’
