 Dean McDermott is bending over backwards to try and heal his troubled marriage to Tori. The couple, who’ve shared their marital woes with fans on True Tori, were reunited again last week when their five year old daughter Stella went under the knife for a tonsillectomy.  ‘Tori was doing her best to juggle work on her new TV series Mystery Girls, and care for her four kids on her own while Dean was away in Canada filming Chopped Canada. But when Stella was ready to go into the hospital for surgery, and their 7 year old son Liam ended up home with the flu, it just became too much for the mom of four to handle by herself.

Togetherness: Dean wants to make it right with Tori, so herushed home to her side in her hour of need

‘When Dean phoned home and heard how stressed Tori sounded at the prospect of facing things on her own, he went to producers and asked if he could take a week off to fly back to LA and help his over- worked, over- wrought wife with the kids.  ‘The Chopped producers agreed to help Dean out and he arrived back in town just in time to accompany Stella and Tori to the hospital where doctors removed her tonsils,’ says the source. ‘And he was there to help nurse Liam back to health. ‘Ironically, Tori also had her tonsils out when she was five,’ adds the source. ‘And at the time her mom Candy gifted her with a little white stuffed dog she named Angel, who she took into surgery with her. Tori still had the pup, dressed in scrubs, so she passed it on to Stella, who cuddled it on the way to surgery too!

Ailing: Stella was in the hospital for a tonsillectomy and Liam was down with the flu, leaving it all down to Tori, who's working on her new show. Then came Dean to the rescue

Salt of the earth: Dean has helped build a very successful Canadian version of the food show Chopped, but he was willing to ask for some time to relieveTori

‘Tori was totally relieved when Dean showed up and stepped in to take over the running of the house,’ says the source. ‘Tori spent the night with Stella, while Dean went home to mind the kids and prepare some dishes his wife could freeze and serve up after he left.  ‘Dean made chicken soup for Stella and he made a Mac and Cheese casserole and veggie squash lasagna for Tori and the kids.  He also stocked the fridge with foods that would be easy for Tori to pull out and fix while he was away.’The source says Dean plans to stay until late Sunday afternoon so he can attend Stella’s 6th birthday party before flying back to Toronto. ‘Stella doesn’t actually turn six until the following day, but Tori planned a party for her on Sunday so Dean could attend,’ says the source. ‘She was very happy that her husband came home to help her in her time of need, and it was a move in the right direction when it comes to trying to put their troubled marriage back together.’
