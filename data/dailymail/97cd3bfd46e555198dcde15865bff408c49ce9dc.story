Stuart Lancaster has come out fighting on behalf of his embattled England side — denying that they are in crisis mode after a shattering run of five consecutive Test defeats.

As the national team returned to their Surrey base to prepare for Saturday’s QBE series encounter with Samoa at Twickenham, the head coach hit back at the intensifying criticism.

Asked if the latest loss, to South Africa, leaves England in crisis, Lancaster offered an impassioned riposte. ‘I don’t think that’s true at all,’ he said.

Lancaster looks pensive on the Twickenham pitch following his side's 31-28 loss to the Springboks 

‘If you say that, you’re talking about a team that has no belief in what they’re doing, has no sense of direction. A group of players who are not aligned with what you’re trying to do and not agreeing with where you’re going, who have poor discipline on and off the field — that’s a team in crisis. For me at the moment, I don’t see any of those traits in this England team.’

Lancaster called in a 28-man squad on Monday. James Haskell is back and destined to start in the back row. There were also call-ups for Northampton flanker Calum Clark, Saracens scrum-half Richard Wigglesworth and centres Billy Twelvetrees and Luther Burrell.

Owen Farrell may earn a selection reprieve, despite his poor form. Lancaster said of his struggling No 10: ‘By his own admission he hasn’t played to the level he would have hoped.’

Gloucester centre Billy Twelvetrees has also been called up by Lancaster ahead of Saturday's Test 

Forwards: Joe Marler, Matt Mullan, Kieran Brookes, David Wilson, Dylan Hartley, Rob Webber, Dave Attwood, George Kruis, Courtney Lawes, Calum Clark, James Haskell, Ben Morgan, Chris Robshaw (captain), Billy Vunipola, Tom Wood 

Backs: Danny Care, Ben Youngs, Richard Wigglesworth, Brad Barritt, Luther Burrell, Kyle Eastmond, Owen Farrell, George Ford, Billy Twelvetrees, Mike Brown, Jonny May, Anthony Watson, Marland Yarde

Farrell could play at inside centre, with George Ford at fly-half, and Lancaster added: ‘Farrell and his contribution with the way the game has unfolded at 12 is an option.’

Kyle Eastmond is unlikely to feature and Semesa Rokoduguni has been left at Bath.

Despite the rotation, Chris Robshaw is expected to stay in the team as captain.

Meanwhile, former Argentina captain Agustin Pichot warned that England’s top stars are being worn out.

‘We are killing the players,’ Pichot said. ‘At the moment we are playing far too much rugby.’
