The Government's 'Business Is Great' website looks like it's for military recruitment, an MP has claimed

Women are being put off going into business - because websites encouraging female entrepreneurship use too many Union flags, an MP has claimed.

Branding on the Government's ‘Great Business’ site is not seen as ‘woman-friendly’ and looks too much like a military recruitment site, a study by the Liberal Democrat’s Lorely Burt has claimed.

Mrs Burt, the government’s women in business ambassador, singled out the website as a barrier for femail entrepreneurs considering setting up their own companies.

She said there was too much ‘untapped talent’ in the country because of the lack of women in business.

The Lib Dem MP said too many women thought entrepreneurship services was ‘not for them’.

The Solihull MP said: ‘One powerful way to show women that services are for them is to be explicit about it.

‘The www.greatbusiness.gov.uk website includes a page explicitly for women in enterprise, which is welcome. It has links of particular interest to women entrepreneurs.

‘To show graphically that the page is for women the bar on the right-hand side of the page uses all-women case studies.

‘However, in all other respects the page uses the same branding as the rest of the Great Business website.

‘This branding is seen as not “woman-friendly”: the proliferation of Union flags, for example, has been compared to a military recruitment site.’

Ms Burt proposes changes to the website and notes clicking on one link leads to the ‘supposedly gender-neutral’ finance page which has three case studies, all men.

Lib Dem MP Lorely Burt said Government websites were not 'women friendly' because they featured Union Flags

She said: ‘The unintended implicit message is that finance is a “male” subject. Women should be treated as a high priority if the Government aims to raise their participation in enterprise to approximately 50 per cent.

‘The link to the women's section of the website should appear at the top of the homepage. Currently it is near the bottom right-hand corner.

‘The women's section of the Great Business website is welcome but the branding should be made more inclusive.’

It adds the website is a powerful tool but needs to ‘speak to women in language they recognise’.

In the report's conclusion, Ms Burt said: ‘Women's employment levels are now higher than at any other time since records began.

‘However, as long as just one business in five is owned by a woman there will be untapped talent which could be boosting the economy and creating jobs.

‘Women's entrepreneurship is a huge potential growth area which will benefit from increased government attention.’
