Olympic gold medallist Anthony Joshua will face Matt Legg on the undercard of the world super-middleweight title rematch between Carl Froch and George Groves at Wembley on May 31.

Joshua is aiming to make it six inside-the-distance wins out of six in his professional career against the Milton Keynes 38-year-old, who has won seven and lost two of his paid contests.

Joshua said: 'I can't wait to box at Wembley on May 31 - it's going to be an unbelievable experience.

'To box at the national stadium on a bill of this magnitude is a real honour and I plan to kick the night off with a bang against Matt.

'I know he will want to put on a show on such a huge occasion but I will be looking to add another big KO to my collection.'

Also on the bill, 2008 gold medallist James Degale faces Brandon Gonzales at super-middleweight, and Jamie McDonnell takes on Tabtimdaeng Na Rachawat for the vacant WBA bantamweight title.
