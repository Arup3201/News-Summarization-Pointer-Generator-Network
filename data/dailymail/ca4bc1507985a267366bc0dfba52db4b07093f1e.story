The family of an NYPD officer shot dead in broad daylight on Saturday has forgiven his  murderer, a relative revealed.

Rafael Ramos' cousin, Ronnie Gonzalez, insists their focus is on remembering the 40-year-old officer, father of two boys, rather than gunman Ismaaiyl Brinsley. 

'[Brinsley] in the hands of God now,' Gonzalez told Pix11. 'We don't believe in vengeance, we just forgive.'

He added that Ramos was due to graduate as a chaplain this weekend.

'My cousin had a couple of priorities in his life,' Ronnie Gonzalez told the Wall Street Journal from outside the Brooklyn home where Officer Ramos grew up.

'One was God, because he was a God-loving man,' said Mr Gonzalez.

'I wish I could be half the man my cousin was. He was sweet. He didn't deserve…to die.'

His words come just 24 hours after Ramos and his partner officer Wenjian Liu were gunned to their deaths while they ate lunch in a patrol car on their first day in a new precinct. 

It has since emerged Brinsley asked passersby to follow him on Instagram and said 'watch what I'm going to do' before killing the two men.

The 28-year-old had earlier posted to the social network boasting that he would take the lives of two policemen.

He walked up behind the patrol car of officers Ramos and Liu, parked up in Brooklyn, then fired four bullets at their heads, 'execution style'.

Brinsley had already been arrested 19 times for offenses including concealing a weapon, disorderly conduct, and trespassing. 

Speaking at a press conference on Sunday, NYPD Chief of Detectives Robert Boyce revealed a timeline which began with the shooting of an ex-girlfriend near Baltimore, and ended with Ismaaiyl's suicide on a subway platform.

Worldwide statement: His message was broadcast across the world as he was filmed at the coin toss

Describing the final moments, caught on surveillance cameras, he said: 'We have found on one of our videos two males who spoke with the perpetrator just prior to the event.

'He asks them three things: For their gang affiliation, he asks them to follow him on Instagram, then he says 'watch what I'm going to do'.

'He then walks north down on Tompkins, past the two officers in the car, circles back around, goes across the street, then comes up behind the officers.'

Boyce added that Brinsley threatened to hang himself a year ago, and had been disowned by his mother and two sisters for being violent and aggressive.

He said: 'His mother ... states he had a very troubled childhood and was often violent. His mother expressed fear of him and she hasn't seen him in one month.

'Brinsley attempted suicide in the past and attempted to hang himself a year ago.'

Last night, hundreds of New Yorkers gathered at the scene of the shooting with blue flowers, NYPD badges, Christmas wreaths and candles to pay tribute to officers Ramos and Liu. 

They sang This Little Light Of Mine and We Shall Overcome.

He said he was heartbroken after Ramos was murdered along with his partner 'just for being a police officer'.

'Today I had to say bye to my father. He was their for me everyday of my life, he was the best father I could ask for. It's horrible that someone gets shot dead just for being a police officer,' Jaden posted.

He continued: 'Everyone says they hate cops but they are the people that they call for help. I will always love you and I will never forget you. RIP Dad.'

It was a somber addendum to an earlier December post in which he honored his dad's 40th birthday.

'Happy birthday to the best dad in the world, you are always there for me even when it's almost impossible,' he wrote on December 9. 'We have so many good times it's not even funny, I love you so much.'

The New York Yankees' Silver Shield Foundation has announced it will pay for the education of Rafael Ramos' two children.

The group will also set aside money for education-related expenses needed by both spouses of the murderered officers.

William Walters, chairman of the group which funds academic expenses for slain law enforcement officers, told ABC News: 'We just want to do good for these people that take care of us'.

He said they plan to discuss the funds with the families on Monday.

The first official words from Ramos' family came at a press conference on Sunday night.

The officer's aunt, Lucy Ramos, told reporters: 'I would like to thank all those who have shared their sympathy and support for our beloved family member, Rafael Ramos, who will always be loved and missed by many.

'I hope and pray that we can reflect on this tragic loss of lives that has occurred so that we can move forward and find an amicable patch to a peaceful coexistence.'

She added that the family extends their condolences to relatives of Officer Liu.
