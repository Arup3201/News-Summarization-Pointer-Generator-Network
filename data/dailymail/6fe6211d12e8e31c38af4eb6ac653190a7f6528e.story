Arsenal legend Thierry Henry couldn't contain his excitement at meeting his 'favourite' Hollywood actor Kevin Spacey as the pair attended the Prince's Trust Awards.

The World Cup winner was so pleased that he had a picture taken with the House of Cards star before sharing it on Twitter with the caption: 'My favourite actor of all time'.

Among other famous faces at the Awards were X Factor judge Simon Cowell, rock star Rod Stewart and TV presenters Fearne Cotton and Gok Wan - while the ceremony will be presented by Ant and Dec in front of the charity's founder and president Prince Charles.

The Gunners' all-time leading scorer has made no secret of his desire to some day step into management and has been juggling a part-time role coaching the north London club's youth development teams with his work as a Sky Sports pundit.

Henry has begun his climb on to the managerial ladder by undergoing UEFA coaching courses in Wales.

The 37-year-old  has been preparing for his UEFA B licence course and is is likely to complete his A licence in the summer.

Although whether he will be asking Spacey, who plays unscrupulous Frank Underwood in the hit US political drama, for any Machiavellian tips on usurping Arsene Wenger is unlikely.

Meanwhile, the former Barcelona and New York Red Bulls star has got fans guessing after posting picture of himself alongside singer-songwriter Robbie Williams on Twitter, cryptically promising 'something special' ahead of Red Nose Day 2015.
