Gun nut: Jack Holsey was found with a dozen machine guns and a stash of child porn

A Californian man was arrested after they discovered a dozen military-style machine guns, drugs and a stash of child porn in a raid on the storage unit he lived in.

Jack Holsey, 47, from Sacramento, was allegedly found with the weapons on Friday after officers served him a search warrant.

He was booked into Sacramento County Main Jail charged with unlawful possession of assault weapons, possession of a controlled substance while armed with a loaded firearm and possession of child pornography.

Bail was set at $75,000.

Inside they apparently seized a dozen military-style machine guns that Holsey did not have licenses for.

Holsey, who has been arrested three times previously, was also allegedly found with methamphetamine for personal use and a stash of child pornography.

Sgt Jason Ramos, one of the arresting officers, said: ‘We don’t know for sure if he was just a gun nut and liked to collect these, or if he intended to sell them, that’s still unclear to us.

‘When you factor in the meth use who knows what kind of frame of mind this guy had.’Ramos would not reveal what calibre the guns were, or if they were operational.

Holsey had been living in a small storage unit without any windows in the Gold River area of the city.

The arrest came after an investigation conducted by the Sheriff’s task force, IMPACT Division based on a tip that suggested Holsey had illegal weapons in his home.

Stash: Holsey was living inside of a storage unit when he was presented with a search warrant

Prison: Holsey was taken to Sacramento County Main Jail after illegal firearms were found at his storage unit home

The division was formed in 2012 to tackle gang violence and illegal fire arms in SacramentoSacramento Superior Court records also show that Holsey had been arrested on at least three previous occasions, including a 2003 arrest for possessing an illegal silencer and a 2004 charge for receiving stolen property.

He was also charged last October for making criminal threats. He is due to enter a plea on March 6.California has some of the toughest gun laws in the country making it difficult to legally obtain a firearm.

He is due to appear in court on Tuesday.

Holsey's arrest comes as Barack Obama makes moves to reevaluate America's gun laws.

Reevaluation: President Barack Obama spoke about changing gun laws during his annual State of the Union speech. Relatives of those murdered at Sandy Hook were in the audience

Activists: Survivors and family members of victims of gun violence, listen during a news conference at the House Triangle on Capitol Hill in December

Experts are encouraging the president to also debate how easy it is for criminals to get their hands on illegal firearms.

While it is currently illegal for felons to purchase a gun, officers across the country argue that it is relatively easy to find one on the black market.

North Carolina's Alamance County Sheriff’s Office spokesman Randy Jones told Burlington Times News last week that: 'Guns are available if you’ve got the money.'

The national debate on gun crime was reignited after the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in December when 20-year-old Adam Lanza killed 20 children and six adults.
