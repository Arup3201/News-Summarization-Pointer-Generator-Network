A young married couple who are both in the Army are spending Christmas apart despite being on tour in Afghanistan at the same time.

Lance Corporal Alisha Henderson and husband Corporal Paul Henderson, who are army chefs, work with different units, which means they never get a chance to meet up.

The pair are both on their second operational tours, but it is the first time they have been deployed over the same period. They arrived in Helmand Province in September for a total of six months.

Thirty miles apart: Corporal Paul Henderson and Lance Corporal Alisha Henderson are both currently in Afghanistan but won't get to spend Christmas together

The couple met six years ago during an army training course, and got married the following year while on holiday in Cyprus.

L/Cpl Henderson said it will be difficult being apart at Christmas but it will have to be 'just like any other working day'. She will also celebrate her birthday without her husband of five years as she turns 24 on 
Christmas Eve.

L/Cpl Henderson, who was born in Edinburgh and brought up 
in Galashiels in the Scottish Borders, serves with the 1st Battalion The
Mercian Regiment. She said: 'I suppose it's just the same as any other couple. We're both out here and both doing a job.

'It's a bit hard as obviously I can't just pick up the phone when I want and ring him whenever I like, and vice versa.

'We get to speak to each other twice a
week, on Saturdays and Tuesdays - we try and keep it to 9.30pm each 
time because we've both got commitments.

'With Christmas coming, we're in the mind-set that it's just another working day. It's how it has to be.

'Even though we can't be together, 
it's still a bit of a support mechanism knowing he's out here too. We 
both understand what the other one is going through.'

Her husband Cpl Henderson, originally from Newcastle, is part of The Duke of Lancaster's Regiment.

The pair, who live in Catterick, North
Yorkshire, just got back from a two-week rest and relaxation (R&R) 
period, which is given to all soldiers who are serving for more than 
four months at a time.

Early Christmas: The couple celebrated earlier this month when they were given leave - it was the first time they'd seen one another for three months

Cpl Henderson said the break was the first time they had seen one another in three months.

He said:  'It's hard being apart. We do get to speak once or twice a week but never actually get to see each other.

'We've just had our R&R break 
together and that's the first time I've laid eyes on her in three 
months. It will be another three or so months before we see each other 
again.'

They celebrated Christmas early with a curry lunch cooked by Cpl Henderson's father, which he traditionally makes for the family on Boxing Day.

Over Christmas itself, L/Cpl Henderson will be at 1 MERCIAN's forward operating base in Shawqat, while Cpl Henderson, 29, will be working about 30 miles away at Patrol Base Attal.
