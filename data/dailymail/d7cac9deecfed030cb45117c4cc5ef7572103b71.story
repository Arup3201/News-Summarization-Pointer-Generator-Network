Commuters have told of the horrifying moment a toddler was injured after she fell through the gap between a London Underground Tube train and the platform at one of the city's busiest stations.

The three-year-old girl had been standing with on platform 2 at Baker Street station with her nanny and another child when she fell between the platform and a Metropolitan line train.

It is thought they were trying to board a northbound service when the doors opened when her carer's back was turned.

The incident happened at 4pm yesterday and passengers quickly hoisted the girl to safety before she was subsequently checked over and assisted by station staff.

Luckily, she only suffered a bruise to her forehead after she hit the metal foot plate of the train.

She was taken to hospital for a check-up and was said to be in good spirits.

A witness who saw the incident unfold told the Evening Standard: 'The little girl was waiting with an adult and another smaller child and was getting ready to board the train.

'There’s a gap on the platform where the track bends around and she fell into that gap. Some gaps are big enough for me to fit in.'

Transport for London confirmed that the incident had taken place and said that an investigation had been launched into how the young girl fell.

Steve White, operations director of London Underground said: 'A young girl fell between a train and the platform at Baker Street station.

'An investigation is underway but it seems that while her carer's back was turned, the girl stepped into the gap between the platform and train.

'The train was stationary throughout and the girl was pulled out straight away. Our staff made sure that she was taken to hospital as a precaution.'

Baker Street underground station is the oldest in central London and has pronounced curve in the track, creating a large gap when a train pulls into the platform.

Mick Cash, leader of the Rail, Maritime and Transport Union, said: 'This is a shocking incident and RMT is awaiting the outcome of the investigations by the Office for Rail Regulation.

'However, once again, RMT warned that there were dangerous gaps between platforms and the trains with this rolling stock.

'This incident again exposes the lethal nonsense of cutting station staff on the underground network.' 

It is the second such accident on a Tube platform in a week after a woman was injured at Clapham South station in south London after her coat got trapped in a door. 

Witnesses told of fire crews hoisting up a Tube train to free the woman on the northbound platform of the Northern line, and claimed the woman was pulled underneath the train as it approached a 'crowded' platform. 

However, Transport for London denied that overcrowding was the cause of the incident.
