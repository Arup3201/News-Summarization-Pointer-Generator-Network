Apple has a strict policy on which apps can grace the pages of its App Store, so it comes as no surprise that many ideas have fallen by the wayside since it opened in 2008.

Many of the applications that have been rejected have been deemed inappropriate - one game involved causing a gust of air to lift up girls' skirts on the screen, for example.

And while others may not have been lewd, they were either entirely bizarre or even dangerous.

The Tawkon Radiation Detector app, pictured, was rejected because it could be used to calculate how much radiation was being emitted by mobiles and mobile phone masts. Apple said the app could confuse users and potentially frighten them and this was irresponsible

The 'mobile sports game' Send Me To Heaven, pictured, was rejected because it challenged users to throw their iPhones as high into the air as possible. It used the device's built-in accelerometer to determine how high into the air it is thrown, but Apple rejected it because it could cause damage to the devices or to the users

To be accepted onto the App Store, apps must be functional in that they must not crash, include hidden features or work in a way other than what the developer advertised.

They must also have a user function and developers can't charge for app that doesn't do anything.

Any app that is defamatory, offensive, mean-spirited, or likely to place the targeted individual or group in harms way will be rejected.

Apps that present excessively objectionable or crude content will be rejected along with apps that are designed to upset or disgust users.

Apps containing pornographic material, defined by Webster’s Dictionary as 'explicit descriptions or displays of sexual organs or activities intended to stimulate erotic rather than aesthetic or emotional feelings', will be rejected.

In summary, Apple said: 'We will reject Apps for any content or behavior that we believe is over the line. What line, you ask? Well, as a Supreme Court Justice once said, “I’ll know it when I see it”. And we think that you will also know it when you cross it.'

Some apps have been rejected because they blatantly breach Apple's guidelines.

For example, apps that were considered 'offensive' or to contain adult or mature content, and were subsequently rejected, include iBoobs, an app that involved shaking the phone to make a pair of virtual breasts move, and PinPoints X that used GPS to plot the location of sex adverts around cities.

There was also the Puff app that involved causing a gust of air to lift up girls' skirts on the screen and Video Strip Poker app that would remove clothing from a virtual model each time a user won a card hand.

Other apps that contained less obvious adult content but were still rejected included PopCap's Unpleasant Horse game.

It involves riding a horse through clouds and sending ponies to their death by jumping on them.

Although it was initially rejected for containing 'mature content', this decision was appealed and the app was later accepted.

The Manhattan Declaration app, which asked people questions about their view on same-sex marriage and abortion, was originally accepted.

Following a petition on Change.org, though, the app was removed.

A revised version was submitted and a counter-petition was filed with 48,000 signatures in support of keeping the app on the App Store but The Manhattan Declaration app was rejected on the basis it was offensive to 'large groups of people.'

An app that was rejected for having 'objectionable content' was called Me So Holy and involved superimposing people's faces on to religious images including pictures of Jesus Christ.

The Obama Trampoline app, left, let users choose
one of 18 high-profile U.S politicians and make them bounce on a 
virtual trampoline. It was rejected because 'Apple does not approve of 
ridiculing public figures.' The Me So Holy app, right, was rejected 
because it contained 'questionable content'

Ghetto Tweets, pictured, was designed as a language converter that would turn regular tweets into street slang, for example, the word iPhone became iPhizzle. This app was originally accepted but following complaints, it was deemed offensive and removed from the Store

Another was called the Herb Converter that could be used to convert amounts of marijuana.

The 'mobile sports game' Send Me To Heaven was rejected because it challenged users to throw their iPhones as high into the air as possible.

It used the device's built-in accelerometer to determine how high into the air the phone was thrown, but Apple rejected it because it could cause damage to the devices or to the users.

The Tawkon Radiation Detector was rejected because it could be used to calculate how much radiation was being emitted by mobiles and mobile phone masts.

Apple said that that app could confuse users and potentially frighten them and this was irresponsible.

An app that was rejected because it had 'no user functionality' was the I Am Rich app, pictured. It didn't have any gameplay or function built-in yet cost $1,000 (£650). It was designed purely for people to show off how much money they had

The Manhattan Declaration app that asked people questions about their view on same-sex marriage and abortion was removed for being offensive to 'large groups of people'

Ghetto Tweets was designed as a language converter that would turn regular tweets into street slang, for example, the word iPhone became iPhizzle.

This app was originally accepted but following complaints it was deemed offensive and removed from the Store.

One of the guidelines in Apple's App Store states that apps must work as expected.

Two apps that were rejected because they had 'no user functionality' at all were the I Am Rich apps and the subsequent I Am Poor apps.

The I Am Rich app had no functions and cost $1,000 (£650). It was designed purely for people to show off how much money they had.

The I Am Poor app was rejected on the same basis that it was simply designed for people to show how cheap they were for buying a 99 cent app.

The Obama Trampoline app, which let users choose one of 18 high-profile U.S politicians and make them bounce on a virtual trampoline in the White House was rejected because 'Apple does not approve of ridiculing public figures.'
