This is the moment a hungry leopard, prowling by the side of a waterhole, made a meal out of a pair of unsuspecting terrapins.

Photographer Hendri Venter, 54, captured the moment as the leopard spotted the terrapins in the water in the Etosha National Park, Namibia.

Mr Venter, from Vereeniging, South Africa, watched as the leopard swooped her powerful paw into the water and fished out two terrapins in one fell swoop.

Mr Venter specialises in wildlife photography and takes people on photographer safari as a tour guide.

He said: 'This was a very rare sighting. Within a couple of seconds the leopard pulled the terrapins out of the water and ate them which is very strange as they are rather smelly creatures.

'The leopard was very powerful and managed to get two terrapins with one strike.

'Normally, leopards will hunt for catfish in shallow streams but when I saw this one by the waterhole I was glad I had my camera with me.'

The scene unfolded at the Etosha National Park, famous for its salt pan which is so large it can be seen from space.

Etosha, the 'place of dry water', is one of the top safari locations in southern Africa.

Its scores of waterholes have a 'magnetic' effect on the wildlife, attracting 150 mammal species including elephants, rhino, springbok and lions - especially during the dry season from June to November.
