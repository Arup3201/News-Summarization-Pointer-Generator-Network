A prosecutor intends to seek the death penalty for an Indiana man who has confessed to fatally stabbing his girlfriend, cooking her body and eating some of her organs.

Clark County Prosecutor Steve Stewart filed his intent to seek the death penalty for Joseph Oberhansley in Clark Circuit Court late last week.

Oberhansley, 33, of Jeffersonville, is charged with murder and abuse of a corpse in the stabbing death of 46-year-old Tammy Jo Blanton September 11.

During his initial hearing in days after his arrest, Oberhansley interrupted the proceeding by announcing his name was 'Zeus Brown' and told the judge, 'You have the wrong guy.'

Attorney Mike McDaniel told the Evening News and Tribune that he expects he will take over as Oberhansley's counsel if the death-penalty enhancement is permitted.

McDaniel said Tuesday that he had a 90-minute meeting with Oberhansley earlier in the day and that they had a 'calm discussion.'

He said it was too early to talk about any defense strategies he might pursue.

Oberhansley is being held in the Clark County Jail. His trial is set to get under way February 16. 

Authorities say Oberhansley was convicted of manslaughter in the 1998 shooting death of his then-girlfriend, 17-year-old Sabrina Elder, in suburban Salt Lake City just days after the birth of their son.

Utah discharged him from parole on July 23, and on July 31, Blanton posted $500 bond for him on charges of criminal recklessness and resisting law enforcement stemming from a car chase. 

On September 11, Tammy Jo Blanton called 911 at around 3am to report that her jilted boyfriend was outside her home and would not leave, according to the probable cause affidavit cited by the Louisville Courier Journal.

Officers arrived on the scene and ordered Oberhansley to leave after Blanton spoke to him outside.

At around 10am that morning, police got another call, this time from Blanton's co-worker, asking them to perform a welfare check after the 46-year-old woman failed to show up for work. 

When police returned to Blanton's house, they found that the back door had been forced open. Inside, officers discovered Blanton dead under a tarpaulin in the blood-spattered bathroom of her home, with fatal injuries to her head, neck and torso. 

'The front of the victim's skull appeared to have been crushed and brain tissue appeared scattered around the bathtub,' the affidavit stated.

The statement added that they found a plate covered in blood and bone, as well as bloodied cooking utensils, the Louisville Courier-Journal reported.

When questioned by police, Oberhansley confessed to forcing his way into the bathroom, where Blanton had locked herself, and repeatedly stabbing her.  

Oberhansley told police he then used an electric jigsaw to open Blanton's skull and ate parts of her brain, heart and lungs. .
