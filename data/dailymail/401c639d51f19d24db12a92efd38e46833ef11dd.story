Mauricio Pochettino insisted he had no regrets about starting top scorer Harry Kane on the bench on Thursday night despite watching stand-in striker Roberto Soldado miss a glorious chance as Tottenham crashed out of the Europa League with a 2-0 defeat against Fiorentina.

Soldado suffered a horrendous moment of indecision when he went clean after half an hour through with the game in the balance at 0-0.

Instead of shooting, Soldado attempted a weak pass to Nacer Chadli which was easily gathered by goalkeeper Norberto Neto and prompted Gary Lineker to tweet: ‘Not sure I've ever seen a player as bereft of confidence as Soldado. Poor b****r!’

Twenty-four goal striker Kane did not make it off the bench until the 63rd-minute, when Tottenham were already trailing to Mario Gomez’s opener. But Pochettino was adamant he had no reservations about his big call to rest the 21-year-old ahead of Sunday’s Capital One Cup final against Chelsea.

He said: ‘We analyse always and try to pick the best team for every game. I repeat – I think we played very well. We created chances and needed luck to score.

‘There is no regret about that (decision to not start with Kane). It is my job, it is my decision. Sometimes you need luck and we did not score and so they go to the next round.’

Referring to the £27m Spaniard’s miss, Pochettino added: ‘I think we are disappointed, the player too. This is normal.

‘This was the first final for us. All the players are disappointed. Now we need to look forward because Sunday we have another game.’

Pochettino also defended his decision to make seven changes to the side that drew with West Ham in the Premier League on Sunday. He said: ‘Fiorentina made nine changes we made seven changes. It is not about selection it is about performance and we played very well.

‘I think in the first half we played very well and deserved more. We had chances. You need some luck to score if you are to win the games. Second half we made some mistakes and took some risks. We did not score and they did.’

Fiorentina manager Vincenzo Montella said: ‘I think there is great satisfaction, a reward for the work put in during the last weeks. We are going through to the last 16 and considering we are going through against one of the richest ranked teams, that says a lot.’
