Facing jail: Helen Hart, 45, of Redruth, Cornwall, spent £6,000 on hiring a private jet to take her from Exeter to Paris and back

A secretary is facing jail after stealing almost £400,000 from her bosses to fund a lavish lifestyle of private jets and sports cars.

Helen Hart, 46, ran up astonishing bills including £5,990 for a return trip to Paris, £7,816 on a hotel stay in Devon, and £4,752 on tickets and hospitality for a Premier League football match.

She also spent £31,368 on renovation work at her home.

Hart was due to go on trial yesterday for theft, fraud and deception, but changed her plea to guilty at the last minute.

In a barely audible whisper, the blonde secretary admitted taking the money.

She also admitted using the company’s cash to pay her rent and water bills, as well as spending £2,000 on a kitchen, £4,985 on 48 bottles of wine and an undisclosed sum on shopping at Marks and Spencer.

Hart also confessed to spending the firm’s money on luxury cars including a Porsche Boxster and a Range Rover.

She spent £46,500 on a Mercedes, too, using money kept in her Coutts bank account.

Hart stole the cash from PDP Green Consulting Ltd, an architectural and engineering firm based in Truro, Cornwall.

After she changed her plea yesterday, the judge adjourned sentencing until next month and the case was not opened.

The main charge was the theft of £380,000 from the firm between October 2005 and May 2011, prosecutor Jo Martin said.

Hart admitted that charge, but on the basis that she only stole £190,000. The Crown said this was acceptable as it would not affect the prison sentence imposed.

Miss Martin told Truro Crown Court that the firm ‘was still solvent’ thanks to the actions of the firm’s directors and belatedly the bank, but it would have gone bust without their intervention.

Piers Norsworthy, defending, had asked the judge for an indication of how long Hart would be jailed if she admitted her guilt.

Judge John Neligan refused to say but
told the tearful defendant that he would give her some credit for her 
pleas, which prevented an expensive six-day trial.

Hart, dressed in a smart black dress,
gripped her hands together as she stood for 20 minutes while the 25 
charges were read out and she answered ‘guilty’ to all of them. Mr 
Norsworthy said Hart, of Redruth, Cornwall, who had no previous 
convictions, had known for some time that she would be jailed.

He said her mother was about to have 
heart surgery, her father suffered from arthritis and her brother had 
been paralysed in a road crash.

Mr Norsworthy said she would like to put her affairs in order and say goodbye to them before she goes to prison.

She was granted conditional bail 
before being jailed next week. The judge told Hart she was facing a 
‘lengthy’ spell behind bars, but he would decide on how long when she 
re-appeared in court.

Afterwards Roger Green, managing 
director of PDP Green Consulting, said: ‘Hart was very manipulative and 
very good at covering her tracks.’ He claimed Hart probably stole more 
than £500,000 from the firm.

Hart posed as a director of the 
company and took money which had been put aside to pay the firm’s tax 
bill, but the court did not hear full details of how she stole the cash.

Mr Green said: ‘She was able to hoodwink people. She managed to keep HMRC at bay.’

The first the firm’s directors knew 
of the long-standing fiddle was when the High Court issued them with a 
winding up order for £231,000 in May 2011 – and the fraud was exposed.

Former managing director Philip Desmonde said: ‘We were close to collapse, the consequences were catastrophic.’
