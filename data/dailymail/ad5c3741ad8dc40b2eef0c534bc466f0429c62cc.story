Custom-made: A bidding war for a diamond-encrusted motorbike with a top speed of 155mph that was designed by England football star Wayne Rooney broke out on eBay

The bike features artwork of Rooney on its rear mudguard, specifically his celebration after an overhead goal against rival Manchester City in February 2011, a goal that helped the team claim the title in 2011 with a 2-1 win at Old Trafford.

Bidders have ‘gone nuts’ for the bike, which is described on eBay as ‘a unique Lauge Jensen motorcycle’ and for which bidding ends on Thursday.
