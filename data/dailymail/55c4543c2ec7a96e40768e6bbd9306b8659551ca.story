A woman has written a lengthy and quite hilarious handwritten letter to her noisy neighbours after enduring four months of sleepless nights due to their incessantly wild nocturnal ways.

Sleep-deprived Melbourne based-actor, Lucy Gransbury, even took photographic evidence of the moment she cheekily threw the note over their adjoining fence before running off in hysterics.

Also a comedian, Gransbury used her humour in the two-page rant to get her rage across to the party-hard residents who live next door and cause her never-ending grief.

Gransbury posted the letter on her blog with the precursor: 'So if you never hear from me again, I've been kidnapped and forcibly trapped in my neighbours' sound system.'

Lucy Gransbury wrote a lengthy and quite hilarious handwritten letter to her noisy neighbours after enduring four months of sleepless nights due to their incessantly wild nocturnal ways

The actor/comedian used her humour in the two-page rant to get her rage across to the party-hard residents who live next door and cause her never-ending grief

Gransbury chose to replace the expletives she had the strong urge to use with the more polite neighbourly word of 'funk' in her letter that was also published on Mamamia website

'Dear Noisy Neighbours,

'There are some choice swear words I would like to throw at you, but in the interest of being neighbourly, I'm going to replace them all with the word 'funk'.

'Please turn your funking music down so I can get some funking sleep,' the letter opened with.

She then went onto say that she had been living for the past four months next to the culprits and was woken up by them 'all the funking time'.

'Last night, like many other nights, it was at 4.30am, a time of morning that should be reserved for breakfast radio hosts, international flight passengers, and parents of infants,' she said.

She signed off with her Twitter handle or if you wanted to follow her in real life just 'head towards the loud house and turn left'

Gransbury said she wanted to yell out to them at 5am but wouldn't have been heard over the revving of their friend's engine of their 'sh*thouse fancy ute.'

'They were then reversing down your driveway for so long and with such difficulty, that I am worried that the man behind the wheel was:

'A) drink driving B) not sure how to drive C) brain damaged D) actually a potato.'

Her hopes of the music stopping were quickly dashed as she continued to hear one note on the bass guitar 'over and funking over.' 

'I'm not sure if it's you, or perhaps a friend, but one man seemed to contribute to the party by yelling 'derpa, derpa, derpa, derpa' at the top of his lungs. Is he okay?' she asked sarcastically.

'I have genuine concern that this man is: A) not sure how to human B) brain damaged C) actually a moron.'

She also gave her neighbours two gifts - a pair of headphones and a CD she compiled herself with apt songs but then revealed that the CD was actually blank because she was 'too funking tired' to burn the songs

Gransbury said she bought this card because 'Shut The F**k Up' was not available in a large size

The music was finally turned down at 6am - just two hours before Gransbury had to go out and begin her day.

'Everyone in my street probably feels the same. And the street behind us. And the deaf man in the next suburb. And anyone buried in the cemetery four kilometres away.'

As the thoughtful neighbour, Gransbury gave her next door pals two gifts - a pair of headphones and a CD she compiled herself with the apt songs: Respect by Aretha Franklin, 'Wake Me Up' by Avicii, 'All About The Bass' by Meghan Trainor, 'Stop Right Now' by The Spice Girls and Uptown Funk' by Bruno Mars 'because it's just a funkin' good song, really'.

But she later revealed in the note that the CD was actually blank because she was 'too funking tired' to burn the songs.

After suggesting to catch up over a G&T sometime, she asked them to 'Grow up. Get some funking manners. And Go. The Funk. To Sleep.'

Gransbury also warned them that she would call the police if there was a next time.

The exhausted performer signed off with her Twitter handle or if you wanted to follow her in real life just 'head towards the loud house and turn left'.
