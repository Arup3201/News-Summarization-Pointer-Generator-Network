Texas congressman and libertarian firebrand Ron Paul turned down a speaking slot in the upcoming Republican National Convention after GOP leaders had demanded that he fully endorse Mitt Romney.

In an interview with the New York Times, Paul, a long-time vocal critic of the Republican Party, said that he declined to take part in the high-profile event set to begin in Tampa, Florida, on Tuesday after being unable to meet the organizers’ conditions.

The 77-year-old congressman said that convention planners offered him a chance to speak only if he delivered an address pre-approved by the Romney campaign, and insisted that he give ‘full-fledged’ endorsement of the presumptive presidential nominee.

‘It wouldn’t be my speech,’ Paul said. ‘That would undo everything I’ve done in the last 30 years. I don’t fully endorse him for president.’

Paul himself was vying for the coveted nomination, but in May, he had effectively ended his third bid for the White House when he announced that he would stop formally campaigning.

Despite his decision to leave the race, Paul’s passionate supporters – many of them college students and small-government types – held on to the hope that the 77-year-old politician could amass enough support to challenge Romney. 

Firebrand: Paul electrified a crowd of nearly 10,000 of his supporters that gathered at a rally in Tampa on Sunday

Die-hard devotees: Although Paul had announced the end of his presidential bid in May, several hundreds of the delegates are still pledged to him

Romney's camp has made attempts at reconciliation with Paul and his followers – especially since several hundred delegates are still pledged to back the Texas congressman.

According to CBS News, a short video paying tribute to Paul will be shown during the convention.

However, the touching gesture is not likely to change Paul’s mind regarding his endorsement of Romney.

While Paul may not have an official role at the upcoming convention, the 77-year-old congressman used the days before the start of the event to ensure that his voice in heard loud and clear.

Unbending principals: During his speech at the rally, Paul reiterated his fervent opposition to big government and the Federal Reserve

On Sunday, Paul staged a six-hour rally in Tampa, whipping some 10,000 of his devotees into a frenzy with a provocative speech attacking both the Republican establishment and President Barack Obama, Fox News reported.

Paul, who has spent many decades pushing for the reduction in the size of government, elimination of the Federal Reserve and return to the gold standard, accused the GOP of bending, breaking and rewriting the rules of Washington for too long.

‘The answer is not more efficient government,’ he told a large crowd gathered in Sun Dome stadium at the University of South Florida. ‘It's getting government out of things they're not supposed to be doing.’

He added, ‘The worst thing we could do is be silent.’
