Warning: Foreign Secretary William Hague, speaking on the Andrew Marr show yesterday, told Britions in Greece to prepare to leave if the country goes under

Britons in Greece were warned yesterday they may have to be evacuated.

It comes as eurozone ministers prepare to sign off another £108billion rescue package for the crippled economy.

Tonight as the bailout approaches, Netherlands Finance Minister has said it's 'really an issue' that Greece has 'time and time again' failed to satisfy the conditions imposed upon it by the international community.

Foreign Secretary William Hague revealed Britons were being urged to register with the consulate as officials are updating plans to evacuate citizens ‘on a daily basis’ in case Greece goes under.

There has been widespread civil unrest in the country as the prospect of it defaulting on its loans and exiting the euro has grown.

Last night 3,000 protesters clashed with riot police in Athens as Greek prime minister Lucas Papademos flew to Brussels for last-minute preparations to seal the bailout deal.

As demonstrators poured into he capital's central Syntagma square riot police shielded the national assembly.

Economists do not expect the new package to resolve Greece's economic problems which could take up to a decade to tackle.

French finance minister Francois Baroin told Europe-1 radio that Europe's leaders were committed to agreeing a new bailout package.

'We now have all the elements of a deal - elements of a participation that remains voluntary for banks and private lenders, and for public lenders states, central banks,' he said.

'We hope we and the Eurogroup members can take into account all the Greek government has been done for several weeks - even several months,' he said.

The Greek government has already 
pushed a massive austerity and reform package though parliament and is 
expected to introduce two more pieces of emergency legislation, 
including wage and pension cuts today.

Mr Hague said the bailout was a matter for Greece and the eurozone, but the UK wanted ‘an end to the uncertainty’.

He added: ‘We have prepared 
contingency plans if we need to help British nationals who are there in 
any way. We keep those up to date on a daily basis.’ 

Fellow
Foreign Office minister Alistair Burt called on Britons in Greece to 
‘register with a consular system so we can find them in situations of 
emergency’.

He
added: ‘No UK national who is there at the moment is unaware of what’s 
happening, so we’ve got systems in place... should the worst happen.’

Austerity anger: A protester attacks police during a demonstration in Athens' main Syntagma square last night as the Greek parliament prepares to vote on cuts needed before a £108bn EU bailout

As the final details of the package are put in place senior eurozone and European Central 
Bank officials held a conference call yesterday to discuss the £108bn bailout programme.    

While there is still scepticism in 
Germany and other countries that Greece will be able to live up to its 
commitments - including implementing €3.3 billion euros of spending cuts
and tax increases - officials said the deal is close to being signed off.

But the prospect of further 
disturbances in Greece loomed again when Germany was accused of seeking 
to undermine democracy in Athens.

Eurozone
finance chiefs will consider a German proposal to ban the Greeks from 
receiving cash unless they delay their general election due in April.

German
finance minister Wolfgang Schäuble wants to keep a technocratic Greek 
government in place to ensure austerity measures are taken.

Fury: Protesters outside the Greek Parliament campaign against plans by Lucas Papademos' government to save more than 3.3billion euros by cutting benefits and the minimum wage

Under the plan, officials from the 
European Commission, the European Central Bank and the International 
Monetary Fund will establish a permanent office in Athens to exercise 
day-to-day control of spending.

But Eurosceptics condemned the plans.

Tory
MP Peter Bone said: ‘Greece is the birthplace of democracy and they 
fought valiantly against aggression during the Second World War to stop 
losing their identity.

‘What they’re being asked to do is sacrifice their sovereignty to stop them from going bust. It’s a recipe for utter disaster.

‘Good
money is being poured after bad. They need to come out of the euro, 
devalue their currency and default on their debts. That’s the only 
future for Greece if they want to be a proud independent nation again.’

Mark Pritchard, secretary of the Tory backbench 1922 Committee, said: ‘If true, this is a dangerous precedent which should be resisted at all costs.

‘Unless people have a stake in the future of their countries, they will be less likely to accept the remedies required.’

The Greek Minister for International Economic Affairs, Constantine Papadopoulos, denied that Greece has any contingency plan for a default.

He said: ‘No, because that would destroy the economy. You don’t factor in options that will kill off any hope for redemption.

‘Now we have to work within a very strict plan in the hope of returning back to growth and becoming a full-fledged member of the eurozone again. Not exit the eurozone.’

Under one crucial element of the new bailout 
deal, Greece will have around €100 billion of debt written off via a
restructuring involving private-sector holders of Greek government 
bonds.

The overall objective is to reduce Greece's debts from 160 per cent of 
GDP to around 120 per cent by 2020 to put their debt on a more sustainable footing.
