The King of Spain's sister has been charged with tax fraud as part of claims her Olympic medallist husband embezzled millions of Euros in public funds.

The High Court on the island of Mallorca upheld the charge today against 49-year-old Princess Cristina de Borbon, whose brother was crowned as King Felipe VI just five months ago.

It is the latest twist in a corruption scandal which has engulfed several members of the Spanish elite.

Investigations have unearthed high-level corruption across Spain involving top players from politicians to bankers to trade unions.

Allegations have ranged from backhanders being slipped to officials at town halls to unchecked spending on company credit cards.

Princess Cristina's husband Iñaki Urdangarín, who won bronze medals for Spain in its handball team at the 1996 and 2000 Olympics, is at the centre of many of the claims.

The 46-year-old is accused of using his connections to win public contracts to put on events through his non-profit Noos Foundation, as well as embezzling millions of Euros in public funds.

He has been charged with breach of legal duty, embezzling
public funds, fraud, influence-peddling and money-laundering.

The couple, who have four children, have both denied
wrongdoing.

Today the court ruled it would drop previous charges against Princess Cristina of money-laundering.

And it is not guaranteed that she will face trial over the tax fraud claims, as Spanish law says the alleged victim - in this case Spain's government - must support the charges. 

The anti-corruption prosecutor of the Balearics, where the investigation is centred, has said repeatedly that he does not believe there is evidence that the princess committed a crime. 

Today's ruling came after the couple's defence lawyers appealed the charges of tax fraud and money-laundering, which were made by a lower court in Palma de Mallorca in June.  

Spain's former king Juan Carlos abdicated after 39 years in the summer in a bid to salvage the monarchy's popularity
after it lost favour following a series of scandals.

The former king made headlines after he took a trip elephant hunting in 2012, when Spain's financial crisis was at its height and one of the worst in Europe.
