Thirty-two people fell from a bank of sand on Polzeath Beach in Cornwall - and ended up in the path of a dangerous rip current.

The bathers, who included seven swimmers, 25 bodyboarders and several children, were all brought back to shore by the local Royal National Lifeboat Institution team.

Senior lifeguard Ben Miskowicz, 
coordinated the rescue which involved colleagues Chris Rowlands, Phil 
Bartlett, Scott Temple, Christian Parker and Craig O'Rourke.

Mr Miskowicz said: 'The conditions at Polzeath this week are particularly challenging, we have a high tide, strong onshore winds and large swell.'

'The winter storms have changed the typography of Polzeath and now at high tide we have some rip currents at both the northern and southern end of the beach.

'The northern rip is particularly prominent at high tide at the moment.

Danger: A senior lifeguard said that conditions at Polzeath beach have been particularly challenging recently

'I was at the cliff top unit at the south end of the beach and Chris was at the northern end while Craig, Phil and Christian were in the water on rescue boards.

'As we had a higher view we were able to spot casualties and guide the lifeguards in the water to them.

'I could see how strong the rip was, when the lifeguards stopped paddling on the rescue board they were pulled away very quickly, it was incredibly strong.'

Chris Wafer, RNLI lifeguard supervisor, said: 'The lifeguard team did a fantastic job last night in challenging conditions and received praise from many members of the public for their efforts in keeping people safe.

'We've seen strong onshore winds and a big swell combined with spring tides in recent days which have created these difficult conditions.

'If you are heading to the beach please speak to the lifeguards to find out the hazards and take heed of their advice.'
