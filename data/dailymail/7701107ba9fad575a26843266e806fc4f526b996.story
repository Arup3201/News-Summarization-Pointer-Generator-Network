Demand for Red Cross food parcels is at its highest since the Second World War.

And while the increase might be expected in war zones or areas affected by natural disasters, the surge in need has come from countries in the EU.

One day after a leading European politician warned of parallels between the continent now and in the days before the First World War, it was revealed people across the whole of the EU are increasingly reliant on charities for food and shelter.

Two thirds of Red Cross societies in 
Europe have begun distributing food aid – the most serious indicator yet
of the scale and depth of the economic crisis. 

Yves Daccord, of the charity’s 
International Committee, said its food distribution had not been as high
since the end of the Second World War.

He added: ‘We
are now seeing for the first time that the Red Cross in several 
European countries need to focus on the poor in their own country, much 
more than on external missions outside Europe.

'We are giving out more 
food in Europe than at any time since the end of WW2.'

'It is not just Eastern or Southern 
Europe; it is across the European Union, people in Luxembourg and 
Finland... Public support services begin to fail and people run out of 
all support mechanisms, so they come to the church or the Red Cross,' 
said Eberhard Lueder, who heads the Red Cross's European Union unit.'

'Nowadays,
nobody knows who is going to be hit next. Many people who would have 
considered themselves safe — middle class — find themselves in a 
situation where they cannot finance their own needs.'

The charity said it is also being asked for record levels of help water, electricity bills and 
rent payments for poor people.

The social consequences of the 
economic crisis worries the EU Commission. José Manuel Barroso wants to 
raise the impact of their suffering on Thursday ahead of the EU's spring
summit.

Countries like France, Germany, 
Austria, The Netherlands and Luxembourg have so far not needed Red Cross
help. But that does not mean people are not suffering too.

In high-density cities in Austria and
Germany for instance, groups collect goods nearing expiry from 
supermarkets and then sell them for a token fee. In Belgium and France, 
there are shops where people can buy food and clothing for heavily 
reduced prices.

Jorge Nuno 
Mayer, the secretary general of Caritas Europa, a Catholic welfare 
charity, said people turn to food aid when difficulties in paying for 
utilities such as housing, water and electricity, mean they have no 
money left for food purchases.

'The information we are getting from Caritas organizations all over Europe shows that more and more people are asking for food aid. The main reasons are increasing unemployment and long-term unemployment, increasing in-work poverty, and austerity measures that affect social protection schemes,' Mayer said.
