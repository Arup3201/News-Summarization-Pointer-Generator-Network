Unbelievable footage taken from beneath a speeding boat in the Atlantic shows what getting attacked by a massive shark might be like.

Thrill seekers off the Maryland coast trailed bait behind their sportsfishing boat and filmed the results with a high definition GoPro camera when a massive mako shark came looking for lunch.

Crewman of the Pumpin’ Hard filmed near Ocean City in July. Now the squirm-inducing YouTube video has rack up an impressive 1.5 million views.

See the video below...

Perfect predator: The mako shark is one of nature's deadliest sea creatures. The beasts can weigh as much as 1,300 pounds and swim as fast as 22mph

The camera is set up facing the back of the boat and puts the viewer in the shoes of the baitfish trailing behind.

A shadow can at first be seen as just a speck in the murky distance. Little by little the size of the beast becomes more clear.

Then like a bolt of lightning, the creature reveals itself: a huge, hungry mako shark.

These intimidating fish are found throughout the Mid-Atlantic and the largest specimens have been found to tip the scales at over 1,200 pounds.

Inch by inch: The mako eases through the water, going from indiscernible shadow to menacing mouth of razor-sharp teeth in mere moments

POV: This startling footage puts the viewer in the unfortunate shoes of dangling baitfish doomed to be snatched-one by one-by the persistent mako

No amateur: These aggressive feeders will attack if provoked and have the razor-like teeth to back up the bite 

A record-breaking mako caught in the waters off Southern California measured 11 feet.

Its exact size is unclear, but the video proves one thing—this mako was hungry.

It snatches each fish trailing the boat one by one, then disappears. Each time, it creeps back into the view of the camera to snag another bite.

Watching this stunning footage will make anyone relieved to be out of reach of these stealthy, deadly predators.
