Luis Suarez has assured Barcelona supporters the goals will soon start to come for him at the Nou Camp but admitted he needs to start acting on instinct in front of goal.

In an interview with Radio Cataluyna the former Liverpool striker also tipped Javier Mascherano to become a top manager after he retires, Neymar to become the best player in the world, and opens up about telling his four-year-old daughter why he could not play football when he first joined the club.

'We have got the best player in the world in Leo [Messi] and the player who is going to be the best player in the world in the future in Neymar,' said Suarez who has so far been king of the assists in Barca's front three with five passes to goal but only one goal.

Luis Suarez looks on with frustration after going close to scoring for Barcelona against Valencia on Sunday

On the subject of scoring he said: 'I got annoyed with myself for the first miss [against Valencia] there was a doubt in the finish, I changed my mind just as I was going to hit it. It was a good job we won because I would have felt even worse. Then I scored a perfectly good goal that was wrongly ruled out for offside.

'I have to get back to just going with my instinct. I had a chance in Cyprus in the Champions League [against Apoel] when Leo set me up and I had the far post to aim for but I wanted to make absolutely sure and tried to hit it hard. I have to forget myself a bit and just go with instinct.'

Barcelona are currently two points behind Real Madrid in the table having lost the Clasico last month. 'We know it is going to be difficult because Real Madrid are very strong but they can slip at any time as we have slipped in the past, that happens in football. We have to keep getting better game by game and we know the obligation is to win,' he said.

And on the pressures of living up to the Golden Shoe reputation he joined from Liverpool with he added: 'I know I've come here to score goals but all the time the team is doing well and I feel that I'm helping the team then I'm going to be very happy. 

'If the team starts doing badly and I'm not scoring then I will have to face the criticism but while the team is winning and I'm helping then it's fine. I want to help with goals, of course I do, but we also have two other phenomenal strikers who score a lot of goals so it is not a drama.'

Despite hitting it off with Neymar and Messi, it is Javier Mascherano who Suarez has spent the most time with since joining, having moved into the same Gava neighbourhood on the Costa Brava. And he has tipped the Argentine to go on to become a top manager when he retires.

He told Radio Cataluyna: 'He is going to be a wonderful coach. He is very intelligent and he sees the game so well. I love him as a player and he'd be someone who I would always want to have on my side. He's clever, he's a leader but he also is great team-player. And you put him anywhere on the pitch and he will deliver.'

The former Liverpool star has only scored one goal for Barcelona since his arrival in the summer

Asked about the disciplinary problems that have plagued his career he said: 'Now I am trying to argue less with rival players. I'm not going to stop fighting for the ball but I'm trying not to fall into the trap of getting involved with defenders because I know I could come off worse because of things that have happened in the past.'

The Uruguyan also opened up on how he told his daughter why he was not initially playing at Barcelona. 

'She is four-years-old but she takes everything in and it hurt me a lot when she started asking why I wasn't playing,' he said. 'At first I would say that it was because of my knee injury. But when we played Rayo Vallecano and I was at home watching the game and she asked me why I was not playing. I said: ''Daddy made a mistake and they have shown him a red card''. And she said ''okay!'' and that was it. There were still a couple more games to play but she never asked me about it again.

'Now she is happy that I'm playing and she knows all the players' names which surprises me a lot. I called her the morning after I scored my first goal in Cyprus against Apoel and she said: ''You scored a goal Daddy and Leo scored two''. I said to her: ''No, Leo scored three'' and she said: ''I only saw two, I fell asleep after that''. So she is keeping an eye on who is scoring the goals.'
