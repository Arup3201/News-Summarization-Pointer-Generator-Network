A teenager hanged herself at the same tree where her elder brother took his own life after she was assaulted during a night out, an inquest has heard.

Upset Abigail Pollard had been out with a friend when they got into an argument with another group and she was assaulted.

The 17-year-old returned home, only to leave again despite her mother Nicola begging her to stay.

Just minutes later she was found dead, at the same spot near the house where her brother Dean had died in February 2012.

'If Dean hadn't committed suicide then Abi wouldn’t have done,' ambulance driver Ms Pollard told the inquest into her daughter's death.

'And if Dean, Abi 
and myself had received appropriate help from social services when we 
asked for it, then none of us would be in this room today.'

Newcastle Coroner Karen Dilk heard how Abigail had been known to the local authority for more than a decade after behavioural problems at home and school.

The hearing was also told that had attempted suicide twice following the death of her 
brother, although in the month before her death 
social workers and her mother believed she was getting better.

'She was a vulnerable young person,' said social worker Victoria Chamberlain.

'And there were concerns about her home life and brother’s death.

'She also had alcohol issues but she had a really good support network and was engaging with drug and alcohol services.

'When
we saw her in the December things were going well, her relationship 
with her mother was improving and she was considered a low risk, with no
immediate concerns about self harm. It couldn’t have been predicted she
would take her life at that time.'

On the night of her death Abigail had been out with a friend in Newcastle city centre, when she was assaulted.

She then returned to her mother’s house, in Brunswick, in the early hours of January 13.

'Abi was drunk but not stumbling,'  Ms Pollard said. 'But she was upset.

'I kept asking, ‘What’s wrong? Where’s your friend? Why is there mud on your jacket?’ but she said nothing.

“She went to leave and I said, ‘Please don’t do this’ but she went off and I was left stood at the front door in my dressing gown.'

Ms Pollard said she then tried to call Abigail's iPhone, only to speak to a man who had found it - and told her he would take it to a police station.

'I spoke to him for a little while, and thought she’d be over the moon that she’d get her iPhone back again,' she said.

'I went upstairs and got my clothes on and went out looking for her. It was maybe only 10 or 15 minutes after she’d left.'

Abigail was found in a copse of trees nearby and emergency services called, but despite efforts to resuscitate her it was not possible to revive her.

The coroner recorded that Abigail’s death was a suicide.

Yesterday, tributes could still be seen to the brother and sister, sat on the stump of where the pair died.

A spokesman for Newcastle City Council confirmed it had felled an 'elder shrub' following a request by the family.
