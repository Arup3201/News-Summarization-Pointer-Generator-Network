This is the shocking moment a rowdy passenger sparked a massive fight on a New York City subway train.

The young woman had been taunting another passenger on the Washington Square station-bound F train, when she was slapped so hard she was almost knocked over.

Another man jumped to her defence as scenes descended into chaos with the men raining punches down on each other.

A woman, who was taunting a passenger on a New York subway train, was slapped so hard she almost fell

A friend jumped to her defence and ended up fighting with the man who slapped her as it was caught on film

The New York City Police Department said it is investigating the incident, which was captured on camera and has since gone viral, according to New York Daily News.

The undated footage, which was uploaded to YouTube on Saturday, has already had more than 600,000 views.

It shows the woman on the train with her friends telling the man, who is wearing a leather 8 ball jacket and fur hat, to stay away before she starts to insult his clothing.

Her friends egg her on and clap as she throws insults at the unnamed man, who nods and smiles at her.

She tells the tall man: 'You got a dumb*** 8 ball jacket that came out in the 1990s.' 

The woman, who is holding a pair of high-heeled snake skin boots, then says: ‘I’m done. You wanna know what shoes I’ve got on? They’re Steve Madden ones, alright?’ before sitting down.

She was insulting his dress sense and told him 'You got a dumb*** 8 ball jacket that came out in the 1990s'

The young woman's friends jump up when they see that another passenger is recording the argument 

Her attention is then drawn to the man filming the incident after he tells her: ‘Nobody wears Steve Madden no more,’ and her friends jump up and charge towards him asking him what he is doing.

He backs off but the woman knocks the phone from his hand – sending it flying to the ground but it is still recording and he tells her ‘you’re petty as hell – you can’t even afford this.’

The man picks it up but she knocks it from his hands again before continuing her attack on the man in the fur jacket.

'You sound stupid,' she shouts at him from behind before hitting him on the back of his head with her boot.

The girl continues to taunt the man by telling him he sounds stupid before she hits him on the back of his head

A man steps in in an attempt to break up the fight but is unsuccessful and also ends up in the middle of the fight

He then swiftly turns round and slaps her hard across the cheek, creating a loud smacking noise.

The girl's friend jumps in and the situation quickly spirals out of control with several people trying to hit each other, while the cameraman screams in excitement.

Another man steps in to break up the fight and eventually two of the men are separated. 

The video, titled 'Man smacks the soul out of girl on the NY Subway', has since gone viral and even led to remixed versions online.
