Hundreds of phone booths in New York have been fitted with 'beacons' - which can locate exactly where a person is - having been given the green light by authorities.

Beacons are a low-cost piece of hardware, small enough to attach to a wall, that use Bluetooth connections to send messages to a smartphone or tablet.

Because beacons can tell someone's precise location, they are attractive to advertisers and have already been trialled in Major League Baseball Stadiums in the US.

The city allowed advertising company Titan to install the Bluetooth devices in phone booths throughout the city.

Nicholas Sbordone, a spokesman for New York's information agency, told BuzzFeed that Titan was allowed to install the technology without any formal approval process, as it was being used for 'maintenance purposes only'.  

For the technology to work, the relevant app is required on a smartphone. Then, when a person walks past a Beacon, relevant content is sent to their smartphone and data can be shared from the phone via the app. 

The app can then communicate with the person accordingly.

One of New York’s leading privacy advocates, New York Civil Liberties Union executive director Donna Lieberman, was critical of the new technology.

He said: 'To the extent that the city is involved in this, the lack of transparency [is] of even greater concern.'

The beacons are manufactured and sold by Gimbal, a company based in San Diego.

A Gimbal beacon requires a third-party app to trigger advertisements and those apps need 'opt-in' permission from users to collect data and send notifications. Users must also have Bluetooth enabled. 

Gimbal-powered apps may collect your current location, the time of day you passed the beacon, and details about your device. These apps may also, under certain circumstances, collect data about the websites you visit, the apps on your phone, and the 'frequency and duration of app usage.'

Gimbal COO Kevin Hunter said through a spokesman that the company only provides clients with 'aggregated, anonymized data.' 

Indeed, Gimbal does not collect names, email addresses, or other personally identifiable information.
