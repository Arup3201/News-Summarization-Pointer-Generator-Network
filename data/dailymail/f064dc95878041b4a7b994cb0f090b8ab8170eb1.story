Ten Israeli tourists have been robbed, beaten and burned in a four hour-long anti-Semitic attack at a hostel in southern Argentina.

The attackers shouted 'f******* jews' at the group and accused them of 'trying to take over Patagonia' as they pelted them with stones and fired a shotgun round at a cabin during the ordeal.

Police called to the incident 45 minutes after the attack began had to withdraw because they were unable to control the situation - one was hospitalized with a broken jaw and two lost teeth.

The group of tourists were staying at the Onda Azul hostel near Puelo Lake, a backpacker's accommodation popular with Israelis, when three neighbours arrived brandishing sticks and bottles and hurling anti-Semitic abuse at the visitors.

The owner of the hostel, 38-year-old Yoav Pollac, said: 'They came in throwing stones, smashing windows,' The Guardian reported.

'They chased after three cars in which some of our guests tried to escape and wrecked them.

'They injured me, my brother and my father, who is almost 70 years old.'

Dario Gonzalez, the Lake Puelo commissioner, said the incident forced the closure of the hostel but the attackers had no political affiliation, according to the International Business Times.

The region of Patagonia made headlines last year during the filming of an episode of the BBC show Top Gear.

Locals chased presenter Jeremy Clarkson, his colleagues and the show's crew out of the country after he drove a vehicle through the region with a number plate many believed was a reference to the Falklands War.
