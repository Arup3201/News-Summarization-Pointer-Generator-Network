Authorities say a crash that killed two adults and two small children was no accident, but a murder-suicide.

On Dec. 23 Ulysses Montero, 25, was driving with his girlfriend Julie Lopez-Elias, 24, and two of their three children Julissa Montero, 4, and five-day-old Delias Montero when the vehicle crashed into a retention pond in Kissimmee, Florida, WFTV reports. 

Though the crash was initially believed to be an accident, an autopsy report declared Montero's manner of death a suicide and the others' homicides. 

Purposely: Police say Ulysses Montero (left) purposely drove a vehicle carrying his girlfriend Julie Lopez-Elias (right) and two of their children into a retention pond in December 2014 

Stacie Miller, a spokeswoman for the Kissimmee Police Department, told the Orlando Sentinel that the medical examiner determined there was no indication that Montero suffered a 'medical episode' prior to the crash. 

'It was determined that the driver had physical control of the vehicle prior to entering the pond and that his actions were deliberate and not accidental,' she said. 

A mechanic determined the car did not have mechanical deficiencies, police say, and video evidence of the crash shows no other vehicles were involved in the incident, WFTV reports.

The medical examiner determined that Lopez-Elias and the two children died from drowning.

Children: Two of the couple's children, Julissa Montero, 4, (photographed) and five-day-old Delias Montero were in the vehicle at the time, both died from drowning  

Reconcile: Police said that Montero had been estranged from Lopez-Elias for months but the two were attempting to reconcile after the birth of their son, Delias (photographed) 

Investigators determined that Montero purposely drove the black, four-door Chevrolet  into the pond on the Valencia College's property.

A witness called police after seeing the car run off the road and into the pond, but authorities were unable to rescue the family in time because the water was too deep and murky, the Sentinel reports. 

Lopez-Elias's family created a fundraising page to cover funeral costs and has since raised more than $10,000.

The couple's surviving seven-year-old son is in the care of Lopez-Elias's mother, the Sentinel reports.

Deliberately: Investigators determined that Montero purposely drove the black, four-door Chevrolet sedan into the pond on the Valencia College's property

Anxiety: Montero's family told the Sentinel that the 25-year-old had suffered severe anxiety since he was a child and sometimes he had to be hospitalized due to anxiety attacks

In the days following the incident, police said that Montero had been estranged from Lopez-Elias for months but the two were attempting to reconcile after the birth of their son, Delias.

Montero's family told the Sentinel that the 25-year-old had suffered severe anxiety since he was a child and sometimes he had to be hospitalized due to anxiety attacks. 

Montero and Lopez-Elias' relationship was reportedly strained by Montero's lengthy rap sheet which includes robbery, drug dealing, and illegal possession of a firearm.

In February 2014, Montero was arrested for slamming his car into Lopez-Elias'. He had reportedly done so, with his two children in the car, because he was angry at Lopez-Elias for coming home late,
