Watching David Silva's mesmerising display last weekend got me thinking: where does the Manchester City winger stand among the great foreign players who have graced our game?

We have been blessed since the inception of the Barclays Premier League to see a number of players arrive here and produce performances that have ensured their names will stand the test of time, but could you make a team out of them? 

So, as it is international week, I've decided to do something different and name what I consider to be the best foreign XI of the modern era. It hasn't been easy and some big reputations have had to miss the cut. See whether you agree with this...

Goalkeeper: Peter Schmeichel 

When people talk about players who made United so successful, he would be competing for one of the top slots. His influence in those initial title triumphs was just as big as Eric Cantona's. 

Even towards the end of his career, when he was playing for Manchester City, he was making extraordinary saves and one performance at Anfield in May 2003 lives in my memory.

Schmeichel also went on to play for Premier League sides Aston Villa and Manchester City 

Right-back: Pablo Zabaleta

Admired throughout the League, he is a top player and what I like most about him is that he just gets on with his job without any fuss, putting the team first. Covers miles going up and down the pitch and has the honours his quality deserves. 

He only cost £6million and could end up being regarded as one of City's greatest signings.

Centre-half: Vincent Kompany 

The biggest compliment I can pay the Belgian is that if he maintains his standards for the next four or five years — and City are successful at home and abroad — he could outstrip John Terry as the Premier League's greatest defender. 

He has the elegance of Rio Ferdinand and the steel of Nemanja Vidic. Speaking of him…

Centre-half: Nemanja Vidic

My type of defender. Liverpool tried to buy him in January 2006 but our loss was United's gain. I'd have loved to have played alongside him and I'm sure we could have formed a solid partnership. 

He loves defending and putting his head in where it hurts. His arrival took Ferdinand's performances up another level. They became the best defensive pairing in Europe.

Left-back: Patrice Evra 

When he was at his peak, all you could do was toss a coin to decide whether it was him or Ashley Cole who you selected for the PFA team of the year. 

A tough, tenacious defender who also scored a number of vital goals. He wasn't the tallest but always provided a threat at set pieces.

Right-midfield: Cristiano Ronaldo

What more can you say about the man who is currently the best player in the world? You could see he was going to reach that level with his pace and power. 

For some reason, he never excelled against Liverpool — he only scored two goals — but he was the reason Manchester United wrestled the initiative back off Chelsea and became England's dominant team.

Centre-midfield: Patrick Vieira 

A monster, his partnership with Emmanuel Petit was as good as anything we have seen. His performance against Liverpool in the 2001 FA Cup final stands out. He was magnificent and didn't deserve to be on the losing side. 

In the dressing room afterwards, everyone kept saying: 'how good was Vieira?' Steven Gerrard still talks about that game as Vieira made him realise he had to climb a few more levels to reach the top. It says everything that clubs, when they sign young midfielders, hope they turn into 'the next Vieira'.

Centre-midfield: Yaya Toure 

His stamp is all over Manchester City's recent trophy-winning exploits and he has always come up with a goal when it matters, be it in a decisive Premier League match, the FA Cup final or the League Cup final. 

A powerhouse but blessed with great skill. Impossible to contain when he builds up a head of steam.

Toure has proved a huge success at the Etihad since his £25million move from Barcelona in 2010

Left-midfield: David Silva

I have to include him, as he is a joy to watch. His form has been so good that City fans are debating whether he can become the club's greatest-ever player. 

Marc Overmars, David Ginola, Robert Pires or even Eden Hazard could have filled this role but Silva is so easy on the eye. Could score more goals but makes up for that with his assists and the way he controls a game.

Striker: Thierry Henry 

I've used this analogy before and I make no apology for using it again. When he hit top gear and ran past you, it was like trying to chase after someone on a motorbike. 

When Arsenal were 'The Invincibles' in the period between 2003-2004, Henry rivalled Ronaldinho as the best in the world. A great goal-scorer, not to mention a scorer of great goals, he is the finest player I have seen in the Premier League. His game didn't have a weakness. Now for the hard bit...

Striker: Didier Drogba 

There were no shortage of contenders for this role, ranging from Eric Cantona, Gianfranco Zola and Dennis Bergkamp to Luis Suarez and Sergio Aguero. But even though they were all better players, I kept going back to Drogba because he did what all strikers should do and that is score in the biggest games.

He scored three winners in the FA Cup final, got the crucial goals in two League Cup finals and who could forget what he did in Munich in the Champions League final? At his best, he was unplayable. So there you have it!
