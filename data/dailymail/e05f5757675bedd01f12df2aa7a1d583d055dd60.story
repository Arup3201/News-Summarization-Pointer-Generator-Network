Away from the pressures of high office, a man is surely entitled to loosen his collar, ditch the tie and relax a little.

Tony Blair, however, went a step too far, adding one of those 1970s-style gold neck chains for good measure.

Coupled with his perma-tan and gleaming white teeth, the effect was more used car salesman than elder statesman as Mr Blair, 59, joined a party hosted by tycoon Sir David Tang.

He was, to be fair, strictly off-duty and no doubt free to follow whatever fiftysomething fashion he fancied – even if it did involve a medallion and a glimpse of chest.

The former Prime Minister and wife Cherie, 58, joined a host of celebrities at Sir David’s Chinese New Year party at the China Tang restaurant at the Dorchester Hotel in London.

With a glass of white wine in hand, Mr Blair, seated next to artist Tracey Emin, laughed and applauded.

Other guests included the Duchess of York, who left arm in arm with supermodel Kate Moss. Her daughters, princesses Beatrice and Eugenie, greeted the Blairs at the door of the restaurant.

Tom Jones, whose tan rivalled the former Premier’s, Stephen Fry, and Jemima Khan – seen linking arms with Elisabeth Murdoch –  were also at the party.

Many of the guests went back to Sir David’s Chelsea home, continuing the celebrations until 6am yesterday.

Since leaving Downing Street in 2007, Mr Blair is thought to have earned up to £80million through a series of speaking engagements, property investments and advisory positions with banks and foreign governments.

However, in an interview last year he denied being motivated by wealth, saying: ‘This notion that I want to be a billionaire with a yacht — I don’t. I am never going to be part of the super-rich. I have no interest in that at all.’
