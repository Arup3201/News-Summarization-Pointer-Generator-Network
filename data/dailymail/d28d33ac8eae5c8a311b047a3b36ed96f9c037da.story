Tens of thousands of homes were left 
without electricity today following a massive power cut after a 
huge blaze in a goods yard in Londonâ€™s East End damaged overhead cables.

Nearly 90,000 homes and businesses in east and north London lost power 
shortly after 3pm.

Traffic lights and street lamps were also
out of action as a result of the blackout.

Around 60 firefighters and 12 fire engines have been tackling the blaze at the scrapyard in Wharf Street, Canning Town.

Tens of thousands of homes were left without electricity today following a massive power cut after a huge blaze in a goods yard in London's East End damaged overhead cables

Fire chiefs said a warehouse, diesel tank and wooden pallets in the yard were alight - but no injuries were reported

Smoke from the blaze, which is now under control, could be seen from several miles away.

Fire chiefs said a warehouse, diesel tank and wooden pallets in the yard were alight - but no injuries were reported.

A UK Power Networks spokesman said: 'We apologise to customers in east 
London who suffered a power cut today when a fire in Canning Town, which
was not on our equipment, damaged overhead power lines.

'UK Power Networks engineers restored supplies to all customers within an hour and 10 minutes.

'Supplies were initially lost to 88,000 customers at 3.11pm. Power 
supplies to 19,000 customers were restored within three minutes, to 
another 38,000 customers by 3.34pm and to another 20,000 by 3.57pm, so 
80,000 customers had power restored within 46 minutes.

'The final supplies were restored at 4.21pm and we are working with the emergency services on site.'

Around 60 firefighters and 12 fire engines have been tackling the blaze at the scrapyard, which lies underneath an electricity line, in Wharf Street, Canning Town

A London Fire Brigade spokesman said: 'Twelve fire engines and around 60 
firefighters are attending a blaze at a goods yard in Ives Road, Canning
Town, involving wooden pallets.'

Transport for London said that the A13 is closed in both directions at 
Canning Town but that Tube and Docklands Light Railway services in the 
area are operating as normal.

Areas affected by the blaze also included the West End, King's Cross, Angel 
Islington, Tufnell Park, Finsbury, and Holloway Road.

Four Tube stations had to close temporarily, although trains were not affected.

A Transport for London spokesman said the stations were closed at 3.15pm, but three had since reopened.

Caledonian Road and Archway were shut until 3.50pm, while Arsenal reopened 10 minutes later.
Tufnell Park on the Northern line remained closed.

The spokesman said the incident had not stopped trains from running through the stations, as the network has its own independent power supply.

Unconfirmed reports said King's Cross
station was closed. Meanwhile, Guardian journalists tweeted they had 
lost their work after their computers turned off before the back-up 
generators came on.
