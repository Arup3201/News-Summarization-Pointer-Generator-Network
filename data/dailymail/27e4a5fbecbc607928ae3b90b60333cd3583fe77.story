The man driving the lorry stopped at the scene, but has not been arrested. Road closures were put in place while detectives investigated.

The cyclist died when he was dragged under the wheels of a tipper truck as it turned left at a junction, according to eyewitnesses.

One witness, a man who declined to be named, said: 'I came past and saw people panicking around the side of the lorry.

'He was trapped under the wheels at the back of the truck, people were screaming, there was nothing that they could do.

'The lorry looks like it was turning left and he just went straight under.

'The paramedics came but he was crushed under the wheels, there wasn't much they could do.'

What was left of his twisted road bike could be seen caught under the driver's cab.

An eyewitness described seeing 'white chinos' sticking out from underneath the cab. James, who refused to give his surname, was travelling home to Dulwich on the bus when he saw the aftermath of the accident.

He said: 'There were a lot of buses queued up, people were looking the windows as the paramedics worked on him.

'We didn't know if he was dead or alive, all we could see was his white chinos. The paramedics were working on him as shocked people just stood and watched.

'When you think you're having a bad day and you see that on the way home it makes you think.'

One local business owner, Aridath Ankeagsack, whose salon is just metres from the junction said: 'I can't stop crying, it's so sad.

'I came out after a client told me what happened and just saw him lying there while the paramedics tried to help him.

'He was just having a normal Monday and then his life ended, I'm so upset.'

Cyclist Tristan Gunnery cycles through the junction every day. Speaking at the scene he said: 'The thing is I've been knocked off a few times but if I see a bus or truck I stay clear.

'The thing is if you're cycling you need to be defensive. The lights are quick there so people rush.

'It lets three or four cars through there so people try and get through quickly.

'But some cyclists take risks, I've learned my lesson.

'I cycle up and down this road every day from work in Elephant and Castle to home in Camberwell.'There's a lot of traffic, it's a tragedy, such a terrible way to go.'

Another eyewitness, who gave his name as Dave, said: 'The first I heard of it was a woman making a wailing noise. She was very near to the junction and there was loads of screaming. I looked out and saw the lorry.

'There were sirens everywhere and someone said a cyclist was trapped under the lorry. It's still out there now.

'A lot of police vehicles were there and then they were putting up a tent so that people didn't see the cyclist.

'They've closed a lot of roads down and I think they're trying to get the cyclist out from underneath.

'The ambulance seems to have disappeared, but there are still a load of police around.

'Cycling is so dangerous in London, people just don't see you,' added Dave, who used to cycle but is now a regular motorcyclist.

'Cyclists are much more vulnerable because they go quite slow, but turning left is always risky.'

Collision: Roger William De Klerk, 43, an IT consultant and courier, of Forest Hill, south east London was killed in Croydon on Tuesday when he was hit by a bus while cycling on tramways

Mustafa Huseyin owner of nearby Mary's Cafe said: 'The customers in my cafe saw people from the ambulance pumping on a man's chest who was on the ground.

'People were standing around, they were very upset, some were praying for him.

'He had been run over by a lorry and it crushed him. It's a dangerous junction, there have been accidents here before.'

One eyewitness, Nettie Williams, tweeted: 'It was a collision on a corner at some lights near Burgess Park. I saw from a bus.

She
added: 'Terrible accident on Camberwell Road SE5. Seems to have 
involved a cyclist and a bin lorry. Person being removed from under the 
lorry.'

The London Ambulance Service said he was treated for a minor head injury and has been taken to St Mary's Hospital.

Candle-lit: Cyclists showed their support for the victims of London's dangerous road network

Last week the Mayor of London was accused of shirking his responsibility and insensitivity after saying cyclists should 'think of the laws of the road' after a spate of deaths involving cyclists in the capital.

Speaking just hours after the fifth cyclist died as a result of a crash on London's roads in just nine days, Boris Johnson appeared to blame cyclists, saying their 'hasty, rash decisions' were 'endangering' their lives.

The mayor's comments came hours after a man died after being hit by a double-decker bus in Whitechapel, east London, the second casualty on London's roads in less than 24 hours.

The Parliamentary Advisory Council for Transport Safety (PACTS) has called on Mr Johnson to take 'urgent action' to make cyclists safer.
