Her Oscar-winner husband Daniel Day-Lewis is notorious for immersing himself in his film roles both on and off the set.

So when Rebecca Miller comes down to breakfast, she can never be sure who will be sitting across from her – a murderous oil tycoon, revered US president, villainous New York mobster, or even an IRA terrorist.

Yet while many would find life as the wife of such an intense ‘method actor’ a challenge, novelist Miss Miller sees the benefits  in such a schizophrenic  environment, saying it has enhanced her writing.

Novelist Miss Miller says that living with such an intense method actor has enhanced her writing

‘I think it’s helped,’ she insists. ‘Writing is a lot about creating characters, inhabiting them.’ But, she adds, whereas her husband’s  personas are seen by many thousands of filmgoers, hers are ‘private, and people don’t get to see’ the creative process.

Daniel Day-Lewis recently won his third Oscar, this time for his leading role in biopic Lincoln

Indeed, Day-Lewis, 55, praised his wife’s patience as he accepted his Best Actor Oscar last month for portraying Abraham Lincoln in Steven Spielberg’s historical drama.

‘Since we got married 16 years ago my wife Rebecca has lived with some very strange men,’ he said. ‘I mean they were strange as individuals and probably even stranger if taken as a group. But luckily she’s the versatile one in the family and she’s been the perfect companion to all of them.’

Miss Miller, 50, the daughter of playwright Arthur Miller, admits she has become accustomed to living with her husband’s film personas.

‘All his characters are wonderful to live with, in their own way,’ she says, adding wryly: ‘My favourite was Abe .  .  . because he filmed away from home, and I didn’t have to live with him.’

The couple split their time between Ireland and New York, living with their two sons, Ronan, 14, and Cashel, ten, and Day-Lewis’s 17-year-old son Gabriel by French actress Isabelle Adjani.

And having the president for a husband and father was undoubtedly easier on the family than sharing their home with Daniel Plainview, the violent oil magnate in Day-Lewis’s 2007 drama There Will Be Blood.

Day-Lewis is famous for his method acting, here as a murderous gangster in Gangs of New York

He has confessed: ‘They did go a  little bit crazy living with Plainview all the time, but the kids thought it was a laugh in the end to have this different bloke as their dad. My wife is amazingly tolerant. She just believes, like I do, that if you are attempting anything of a creative nature, no rules apply.’

Miss Miller’s latest novel Jacob’s Folly, about an 18th Century Parisian Jewish merchant who is reincarnated as a housefly in modern-day New York, was published in the US last week and comes to the UK in May.
