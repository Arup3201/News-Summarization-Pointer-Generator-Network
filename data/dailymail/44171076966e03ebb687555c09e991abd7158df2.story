Militant hunt saboteurs have vowed to disrupt the start of badger culling by infiltrating animal rights groups planning peaceful protests.

Police have increased patrols in the countryside fearing violent clashes between farmers and hardcore opponents when the cull begins, which could be as early as today.

More than 500 protesters are expected, with even some of those planning to demonstrate peacefully saying they are prepared to run from footpaths into the line of fire of the farmers culling the badgers to force them to put down their arms.

But others are veterans of the anti-hunt sabotage campaigns.

The cull is an attempt to tackle bovine tuberculosis which is transmitted by badgers and has led to the death of 305,000 cattle in the UK over the past decade.

Farmers say the cull is the only way to protect their livelihood and the Government has approved trials in West Gloucestershire and West Somerset that could see as many as 5,000 badgers killed.

Police have said militant campaigners have infiltrated local campsites and have been spotted patrolling farmers’ fields wearing balaclavas at night. One group, Bristol Hunt Saboteurs, said it would trespass on to sites with large horns to scare the badgers away and remove bait left by farmers.

It comes as a protester was arrested yesterday for allegedly trying to break in to a Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs site in Stroud, Gloucestershire.

Joe Mossman, of Bristol Hunt Saboteurs, said ‘extensive research’ had been carried out to find out where the badgers’ setts are and where peanut bait had been laid by farmers.

He added: ‘The intention is to just turn up in large numbers, making lots of noise, getting in the way and having a massive presence. We will try to locate the shooters, which will involve trespass if necessary.

‘Spoiling bait is one of the  most effective ways you can sabotage the cull, because if the bait’s not there the badgers won’t be drawn away.’

Dozens of people have also set up a camp, dubbed Camp Badger, on the outskirts of the sleepy harbour town of Watchet, Somerset.

Mostly members of campaign group Stop The Cull, they intend to carry out nocturnal patrols looking to document evidence of wounded badgers.

Protest: Animal rights groups say badgers should be vaccinated instead of culled

Carla Kidd, 39, a gardener from Penzance, Cornwall, said: ‘If it came down to it and I was in the killing zone, then yes, I would run in front to try and stop the shooting. That would be my natural reaction.‘It’s your natural instinct to protect an animal as if it was a pet or your own child.'

'Our intention is to carry out peaceful protest while on patrol at night and stick to the footpaths, but I couldn’t say that I’d stick to that if I saw culling. Our main task is about raising awareness.’

Miss Kidd added that protest groups had been buoyed by recent anti-fracking protests in Balcombe, West Sussex, when hundreds of activists were able to stop exploratory drilling temporarily.

The past 15 years has seen a boom in bovine TB which is spread to cattle when badgers urinate on grass which is eaten by cows.

The trial scheme is due to continue every year for the next four years, and is predicted to cut bovine TB by 16 per cent.

Two
companies have been given the licence to carry out the culling in the 
counties, but both Defra and Natural England, the public body 
responsible for the operation, have kept their identities a secret in 
case activists target them directly.

Last
week the National Farmers Union was granted an injunction in the High 
Court barring anti-cull activists from approaching farmers’ homes, 
business premises and cull sites.

Animal
rights groups, which include support from guitarist Brian May and 
actress Dame Judi Dench, say the authorities should vaccinate badgers 
instead.
