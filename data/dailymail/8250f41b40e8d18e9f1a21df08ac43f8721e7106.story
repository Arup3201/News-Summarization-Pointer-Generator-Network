More than 20 British sports pupils were rushed to hospital with severe dehydration, diarrhoea and vomiting just hours after arriving in Dubai for a training camp.

The 23 children aged between 11 and 16-years-old and their coach were treated en masse at the Saudi-German Hospital after arriving from Country Durham for a coaching trip.

It is thought the illness which swept through the sports camp was a sickness bug picked up in the UK, as three of the students had been suffering from a viral infection prior to their arrival.

The hospital had to bring six doctors, a team of nurses and 24 extra beds in to A&E.

'Half of those admitted had to be put on hydration fluid drip,' said Dr Ali Ziaee, head of the emergency department at the hospital.

'Their situation has now stabilised but the majority has to stay hospitalised for now.'

The Dyke House College team from Hartlepool were taken in three ambulances – including a bus ambulance used for mass casualty incidents – from the Premier Inn in Silicon Oasis.

Police were also sent to the hotel before the group was admitted to the hospital in Al Barsha on Saturday morning.

A total of 46 students and three coaches arrived on Thursday for a seven-day training camp.

The symptoms first appeared in an 11-year-old boy who started vomiting about 6pm on Friday.

But overnight many more of the group became unwell.

Danny Evans, 38, one of the coaches, said: 'We decided to wait first thing at breakfast but things were worse than we thought.'

He said that the group had thought they had food poisoning, and had a takeaway pizza on Thursday evening, a catering company lunch on Friday and dinner out in Mirdif on Friday.

But Evans added: 'They did not eat all at one place, but at various outlets.'
