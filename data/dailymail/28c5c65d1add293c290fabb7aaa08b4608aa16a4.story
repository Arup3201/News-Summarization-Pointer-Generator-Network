The high-school teacher who is accused of having had an affair with Simon Cowell's pregnant lover when she was a student has denied the claims.

Steven Lewis allegedly enjoyed a relationship with 16-year-old Lauren Silverman when he was teaching English at a Â£19,000-a-year private school in Florida, with both of them leaving the institution after the friendship was found out.

But yesterday he insisted that the pair did not have an affair - although he confessed to a 'drunken phone call' and said he was 'eternally sorry and remorseful' for his inappropriate behaviour.

Mrs Silverman was catapulted to global fame last week when it emerged that she was pregnant with Mr Cowell's baby and was divorcing her husband Andrew, a friend of the X Factor mogul.

The Mail on Sunday reported that when Mrs Silverman, then called Lauren Davis, was in high school she caused a scandal by having an 'improper relationship' with Mr Lewis, who was 10 years her senior and was married.

Classmates at Miami Country Day School said that the pair had dated for a month and a half, and that their 'affair' was discovered by her mother, leading Mr Lewis to be sacked while the teenager was transferred to another school.

However, Mr Lewis has insisted that this report is inaccurate, and claimed that he was a 'victim' of the high-profile relationship between Mrs Silverman and Mr Cowell.

'There was never any month, month and a half or two-month affair between me and a student,' he told the New York Daily News in an impassioned email.

'There was a drunken phone call, late at night, for which I am eternally sorry and remorseful and for which I resigned the following day OVER 20 YEARS AGO.'

The ex-teacher added: 'Was I naive and even a bit flirtatious with someone nine years my junior? Yes.'

Mr Lewis' father Peter told the Mail on Sunday last week that the scandal over the relationship had caused his son to quit teaching for good.

'He had to leave town because of this bimbo,' he said. 'After he left the school, Steve worked for FedEx and worked for a rental car agency and then his wife got a job in Idaho over ten years ago. They have since moved to Montana.'

But Steven Lewis claimed that he had moved in order to get a better job.

He also claimed that he had been unable to escape the furore which has erupted over his connection to Mrs Silverman, pointing out that unlike Mr Cowell he cannot simply flee the country to avoid publicity.

Her classmate Jerry Raphaelson said of the alleged affair: 'It was a relationship that went on for a month and a half. Virtually all the students knew about it. She was one of the good-looking, popular kids - part of the "in" crowd.

'Steve was our English teacher. He was a very good-looking guy, high-energy, personable and very charismatic. Everyone loved him.

'He was as charming as can be. He was very outgoing, very social. He'd pat you on the back, give you a hug.'

Mr Lewis has remained with his wife Michelle, whom he married before the alleged relationship with his student.

All hands on deck: Simon Cowell is believed to be lying low while the furore over Silverman's pregnancy continues. His yacht was seen today being maintained in Nice, though the X Factor mogul was not spotted
