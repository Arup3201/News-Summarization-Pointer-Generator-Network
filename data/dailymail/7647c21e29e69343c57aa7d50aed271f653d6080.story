A naked man was arrested after breaking into two houses, drinking one homeowners' alcohol while he used their hot tub and shower. 

Guillermo Brambila Lopez, 24, was found at a home in Keizer, Oregon, at 4.52am on Sunday after the house-sitter was awoken by noises and called 911.

An investigation soon discovered his clothes at a neighbor's house, where police believe he used the shower then hot tub, while drinking alcohol from the drinks cabinet.

He was arrested without incident and wrapped in a protective yellow blanket. 

Lopez is suspected of burglarizing both houses and forcing entry by taking the screens out of the window frames. 

The house-sitter of the second home told police she was awoken by noises coming from the laundry room.

As she went to investigate, the laundry room door slammed, so she grabbed a knife and called police and her husband.

Investigators determined that he climbed in through a back window.

Lopez was charged with two counts of burglary and one count of criminal mischief, according to the Statesman Journal. 

Bail was set at $82,500.
