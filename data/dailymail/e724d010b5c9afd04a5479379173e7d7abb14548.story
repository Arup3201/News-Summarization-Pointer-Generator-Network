Coronation Street star Beverley Callard has revealed how friends distanced themselves and 'abandoned' her after learning of her battle with depression.

The actress, who plays Liz McDonald on the ITV soap, said people battling mental illness should be encouraged to share their fears with those close to them.

The 57-year-old, who has fought depression and attempted suicide in the past, told BBC Radio Manchester it was easy for sufferers to feel isolated and alone. 

'I had one person say to me, and we'd been friends for a long time, "I don't think we should see each for a while because you're not yourself and you're not good for me",' she said.

Coronation Street star Beverley Callard has revealed close friends 'abandoned' her after learning of her battle with mental health problems. The 57-year-old has battled depression for years, and has attempted suicide

'We actually got way beyond that, but at that time I felt abandoned by lots of people - and I think many people do.'

Beverley said she believes the stigma attached to mental health issues can prevent people discussing their problems with family and friends.

She said: 'We say to someone "how are you?" but more often than not we actually don't wait for the answer.

'If you just get the feeling that someone you know is suffering is sad say, "how are you? Do you want to talk about it?"

'And if you are the person being asked that question, try to talk about it.'

The actress spoke out as a new survey revealed almost 60 per cent of people with mental health problems wait more than a year to tell the people closest to them. 

The survey, carried out by campaign group Time to Change, also found 64 per cent of respondents believe the stigma and discrimination they experienced was as bad as or worse than the mental health problem itself. 

The group is calling for people to 'break the silence' surrounding mental health problems and to spend five minutes today discussing the subject.

Sue Baker, director of Time to Change, said: 'It's shocking to see that so many people are still waiting over a year to talk to their nearest and dearest - it's hard to imagine this happening with other health issues.

The actress, who plays Liz McDonald on the ITV soap, said people should be encouraged to talk to those closest to them when dealing with mental health issues

'We know that talking openly about mental health is a vital first step towards breaking down stigma and discrimination, so we are asking people to take five minutes on February 5 to do just that.

'With major employers, politicians, universities, schools and tens of thousands of individuals taking part, we've come a long way towards breaking the silence.

'But this new data shows there is still much further to go until talking about mental health is an ordinary and unremarkable thing to do.'

Beverley, who was forced to take five months off from Coronation Street in 2009 after checking into The Priory for depression, spoke in 2013 of how her mental health problems had affected her work.

'I think some people see you as unreliable and flaky and that you might not be able to do your job as well as you could,' she told the Radio Times.

'And I was very aware that some people at Granada felt like that about me at the time. I didn't want to be talked about like that because, if I take something on, I usually finish it to the very end and do the best that I can.' 

In 2007, Beverley revealed how five years after a hysterectomy in March 1991 - carried out as treatment for cancer - she began to feel 'life was a battle' and dreaded going to work.

After a year of increasing despair, the day came where she broke down on set.

Beverley, pictured with her on-screen ex-husband Jim McDonald, played by Charles Lawson, spoke out as the campaign group Time to Change launched a campaign encouraging people to talk about mental health issues for five minutes a day

'The pretence was over. My heart was beating fast, I was sweating - I didn't have a shread of self-esteem.'

It was then that the ITV doctor diagnosed the actress with depression.

'I was shaking and felt numb,' she said in an interview.

'When he said I had clinical depression it was a surprise. I never thought that I would suffer depression.'

Fifteen months later, Beverley collapsed at home and was admitted to The Priory.

Then, two years after her first diagnosis, she learned the problem was actually her ovaries.

They were no longer producing enough oestrogen - a hormone that affects mood and cognition.

She was prescribed the antidepressant Clomipramine along with the oestrogen supplement Climaval, and a testosterone supplement Restandol.

Slowly, she began to have days when she felt less miserable.

In 2002 things began to improve markedly and Beverley came off the antidepressants and was put on Prozac.

The next year she returned to Coronation Street.
