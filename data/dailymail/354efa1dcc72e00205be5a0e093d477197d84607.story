When women first started coming forward to accuse Bill Cosby of rape last month, the public was surprised due to his flawless reputation as 'America's dad'. 

It has now been revealed that a team of lawyers and publicists worked tirelessly to keep his image pristine for decades, by silencing alleged victims and keeping the media from reporting their claims, the New York Times reports.  

That apparently all-male team includes $850-an-hour Hollywood lawyer Martin Singer (whose clients include Charlie Sheen and Arnold Schwarzenegger), former William Morris agent Norman Brokaw, his publicist son David, and New York lawyer John P Schmitt.

Reputation tarnished: In recent weeks, Bill Cosby has faced an onslaught of accusations from women who claim to have been raped or sexually assaulted by him. A new report reveals how his legal and media teams have protected his reputation for decades

Most of the allegations against Cosby date back to the 1970s, which led to speculation over why the women stayed silent for so long.

Like many rape victims, some of the women said they never reported the assault because they were scared of Cosby’s power and feared damaging their reputation.

The reaction of Cosby’s legal team to the women brave enough to come forward over the years proves that those who stayed silent had good cause for concern.

Those who have reported their rapes, either to police or in the media, have had their claims called ‘meritless’ by Cosby’s legal team, who depict them as greedy women seeking to destroy the once-beloved comedian’s reputation for a cut of his fortune.

This pattern of intimidation goes all the way back to 2000 when an actress on his TV series ‘Cosby’ allegedly told police that he tried to put her hand down his sweatpants during a visit to his New York townhouse.

Cosby’s lawyers threatened to sue the National Enquirer with a $250million defamation lawsuit if they published comments from the alleged victim’s relatives.

But his legal team also works with the media to damage Cosby’s alleged victims and discredit their stories.

Just five years after threatening to sue the Enquirer, the paper was once again investigating claims against Cosby after Temple University employee Andrea Constand publicly accused the comedian of drugging and assaulting her at his Pennsylvania home.

Alleged victims: Andrea Constand (left) was one of the first victims to publicly accuse Cosby  when she filed a lawsuit against him in 2005. His team sought to discredit her by revealing that her mother asked Cosby for money before she went to police.

The Enquirer was looking to report on claims by another woman, Beth Ferrier, but Cosby’s team effectively silenced that woman’s story by offering an exclusive story from Cosby telling his side of the story.

Suing: Tamara Green claims to have been sexually assaulted by Cosby in the 1970s and told her story in 2005 to two outlets. She is now suing Cosby for defamation, claiming his team as repeatedly depicted her as a liar in the media

They employed the same tactic against Constand, whose mother allegedly asked Cosby to ‘make things right with money’ before her daughter went to the police to report the crime and one of Cosby’s lawyers called the move ‘a classic shakedown’, according to TV show Celebrity Justice which reported on the suit at the time.

In court, Cosby’s legal team acknowledged that the lawyer in question was Singer. Constand’s suit was later settled out of court for an unknown sum.

Also in 2005, a woman named Tamara Green said she was sexually assaulted by Cosby in Los Angeles in the 1970s and told her story on the Today Show and to the Philadelphia Inquirer.

Cosby’s lawyers called Green’s claims ‘absolutely false’ and even offered ‘damaging information about her to the newspaper.

As more and more women came forward in recent weeks to accuse Cosby, Green went public again with her story and Cosby’s lawyers reacted the same way - saying her claims were ‘a 10-year discredit accusation that proved to be nothing at the time, and is still nothing’.

Green is now suing Cosby for defamation, claiming she has been depicted as a liar with these statements and continued assault on her reputation.

‘I want it put to a jury. I want it ended, finally. I want my name restored,’ she said earlier this month.

One of the most shocking claims in the scandal comes from a woman named Judith Huth who says she was just 15 years old when Cosby got her drunk and forced her to perform a sex act on him at the Playboy Mansion.

Huth filed a lawsuit against Cosby this month, but his lawyer Singer has tried to discredit the claims by revealing that Huth unsuccessfully attempted to sell her story to a tabloid a decade ago.

Celebrity: Former supermodel Janice Dickinson is another one of the more than two dozen women who have come forward to accuse Cosby. Cosby's team threatened Buzzfeed as they were preparing an article on her account

In court records, Singer has called her claims ‘meritless’ and a ‘shakedown’.

Cosby’s legal team is just as threatening with the media, and have in recent weeks sent letters to outlets like CNN and the New York Daily News urging them to stop their coverage of the scandal.

‘The media has consistently refused to look into or publish information about various women whose stories are contradicted by their own conduct or statement,’ Singer wrote in a letter to The Daily News, obtained by the Times.

Cosby’s lawyers also tried to stop Buzzfeed from publishing an account from former supermodel Janice Dickinson, who has also accused the comedian of sexual assault.

‘You proceed at your own peril,’ Singer wrote to the website, pointing out inconsistencies between Dickinson’s story and what she wrote in her memoir.

Just yesterday in a story published in the New York Post, Singer blamed the media for reporting on claims from women he doesn’t believe have been properly vetted.

‘You [the media] don’t need private investigators to find out information about the accusers. A simple Google search will obtain the information,’ Singer said in a statement.

Singer was commenting on a story in which it was revealed that Cosby is allegedly paying six-figure fees to a team of private investigators digging dirt on his accusers.

A source told the paper that Cosby has hired a Glendale, California firm to discredit his many alleged victims' stories.  

Cosby allegedly spoke with his legal and public relations teams about the sex scandal, and his response to it, at a recent meeting.

'If you’re going to say to the world that I did this to you, then the world needs to know, ‘What kind of person are you? Who is this person that’s saying it?’ ' Cosby said, according to an anonymous source who was present at the meeting. 

'You can’t say that I put something in your coffee, threw you in a cab and then you go on and live a high-profile life, a famous life and you never complain. You mean you never reported it to the police? You never tell anyone?' Cosby continued, referring to one of his accusers, Beverly Johnson.

Johnson claimed that Cosby raped her after slipping a drug into her cappuccino during a visit to his home in the 1980s.

Another source who says they have worked with Cosby for at least a decade confirmed the tactic and said it has already been successful in finding information to discredit both Johnson and another alleged victim, Katherine McKee.

The team discovered that Johnson's live-in boyfriend at the time only heard her say nice things about Cosby and that McKee, an ex-girlfriend of Sammy Davis Jr, wrote posts praising the comedian online after the alleged rape, according to the Post. 

In a published interview, McKee also once said she is 'used to lying'.

McKee, now 65, is the latest woman to publicly come forward to accuse Cosby, saying the comedian raped her in a Michigan hotel room in the early 1970s after inviting her to a party on a boat in Detroit. 

The former actress, who appeared on Sanford and Son and even The Bill Cosby Show, never spoke of the incident in public before last week.   

'It was a rape, but it seemed so strange to call it that. We think of rape as a stranger who attacks you in a parking lot,' McKee, now a casting agent, told the New York Daily News. 'I chalked it up to another powerful person in Hollywood who just felt he could take what he wanted from women.' 

Cosby's attorney Martin Singer would not confirm whether the comedian had hired any private detectives.
