Former Manchester United defender Wes Brown has labelled Anderson the least intelligent footballer he has played with during his 18-year career in the professional game. 

Brown has revealed his astonishment at the fact Anderson, who looks set to leave Manchester United in January, cannot speak fluent English despite moving to Old Trafford back in 2007.

When asked who the least intelligent player he had played with was the centre half, speaking to Sunderland's official YouTube channel, said: 'Not going to say anyone at Sunderland because that will get back.

'I'd go Anderson. Just because when I was with him he was there for four years and I honestly still don't think he can speak English.'

The 35-year-old revealed Manchester United's Champions League final match against English rivals Chelsea in 2008 was his favourite game of his career. 

He added: 'The Champions League final against Chelsea [was my favourite game]. I managed to play most of that season at right back and we managed to get to the final and win the game.'

In a quick-fire  question-and-answer session, Brown said Cristiano Ronaldo or Nani were the fastest players he had played with, Laurent Blanc was the slowest and Ryan Giggs was the best.
