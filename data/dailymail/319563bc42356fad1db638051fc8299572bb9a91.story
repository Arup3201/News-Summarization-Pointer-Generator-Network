A neighbour has admitted throwing raw chicken, bananas and pickled onions on the driveway of a man dubbed the ‘mooning millionaire’ after a bitter dispute with another neighbour.

Mari Hannah Swanson, 30, who lives in the wealthy suburb of Kingswood, Surrey, has been handed a restraining order banning her from contacting  Neville Williams after admitting harassing him.

Mr Williams, 53, had been locked in a bitter six-year dispute with neighbour, Gerald Mead, 72, over a narrow strip of land between their properties - with both believing the land belonged to them.

Mr Williams chopped down trees planted on the border by Mr Mead - and a smashed greenhouse, burnt trees and Mr Williams removing his trousers before ‘mooning’ at Mr Mead all followed.

Although Mr Williams has said there has been some resolution to the border dispute, he is convinced it is the reason for Swanson’s attacks on his £950,000 two-bedroom detached house.

He said: ‘We don’t know her from Adam. But we have been in a dispute with my neighbour for quite a while and he has been going round to neighbours and saying things against me.

‘It was decided he would put up a fence along the boundary by June 8 which he hasn’t. This may have been how she came round and decided to attack my property.’

Mr Williams said the chicken, bananas and onions were thrown on separate occasions, and not ‘in a lump sum’, while Swanson was hiding in Mr Mead’s bushes.

He said he caught her red-handed with cat food she intended to throw onto his driveway and called the police, who later arrested her.

‘She painted my brick wall white,’ added Mr Williams. ‘She would go round the area picking up rubbish, put it in her car and dump it onto my property.’

Mr Williams said: ‘I have been here 12 years and never had any problems. My neighbours have come to apologise about what’s been happening.’

But Mr Mead strongly denies knowing Swanson or spreading any rumours about Mr Williams.

He said: ‘I had never seen her in my life and had no contact with her. I don’t have to talk to the neighbours. The neighbours see what’s happening.’

Mr Mead said he saw Mr Williams and Swanson interact on the night the police were called and hinted: ‘From the body language, I would say he knows her.’

He said he will put up the fence next month and then consider selling-up.

‘There was a lot in the papers about me saying I didn’t want it to look like Sutton. And there was him pulling his trousers down and showing his a*** to my grandchildren,’ said Mr Mead.

‘I want to move on. You live somewhere like this because you feel it’s private and you have the seclusion with all the trees. I’ve got nothing now.’

Mr Williams said he is surprised that Swanson was not ordered to pay any compensation for his brick wall, and said: ‘I just want to live a nice, quiet, peaceful life.’

Land: Mr Mead had planted trees on the narrow strip of land between their two houses as he believed it was his

Mr Williams has lived at his two-bedroom detached house since 2002, while Mr Mead has been at his five-bedroom detached house for at least 20 years. Their road's average house value is £1million.

Swanson admitted harassing Mr Williams between July 7 and 16. She also pleaded guilty to damaging Mr Williams’s brick wall after painting it white.

She was given a restraining order banning her from contacting her victim until next September.

She received a 12-month conditional discharge and was ordered to pay a £15 victim surcharge and £85 in costs.

Swanson also received a 12-month conditional discharge for the wall damage, although no compensation was ordered by the court because the amount was ‘not substantiated’.

It was alleged she had thrown paper rubbish across Mr Williams’s driveway and went to his home intending to throw bags of wet cat food - but both charges relating to this were withdrawn in court.
