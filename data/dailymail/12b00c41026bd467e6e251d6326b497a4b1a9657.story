A teenager battling cancer with just days to live has fulfilled his last wish by taking his girlfriend to his school prom.

Jak Trueman was applauded by tearful classmates at the event, organised at the last minute, after doctors told him he was dying.

More than 200 teachers and pupils from West Calder High, West Lothian, Scotland, watched the 15-year-old keep his promise to take girlfriend Hannah Boyd, 14, to the prom.

The young couple have been going out for almost two years.

Jak Trueman, pictured at prom with girlfriend Hannah, was applauded by tearful classmates at the event, organised at the last minute, after doctors told him he was dying.

And it was the youngster's dying wish to accompany her to their last school event together at Livingston Football Club near his home in Mid Calder, West Lothian.

The teenager had to receive much-needed pain relief to make the prom after he deteriorated on Thursday and his family feared he wouldn't survive the night.

His mother Alison revealed they were living 'minute by minute, hour by hour' desperate for him to improve.

Jak has terminal T-Cell Lymphoma, which was diagnosed in August last year.

He was in line to take more treatment until scans showed early last week the cancer had spread throughout his body.

'We will just take it minute by minute hour by hour,' she said.

'The prom was about my boy and Hannah.

'He managed to make the evening for 10 minutes through wonderful courage and determination.'

She added: 'Jak and Hannah are exceptionally close and I think it is absolutely magical that the school brought the prom forward, what they have done this for both of them

'It is overwhelming what the school has arranged.'

Jak vowed to dedicate what time he has left to raising cash for Leukaemia and Lymphoma Research charity.

Thanks to hundreds of supporters worldwide, he has raised more than £33,000 in less than a week.

'A phenomenal amount for my phenomenal boy - making things a little easier knowing others will benefit,' Mrs Trueman added.

He hopes to raise enough cash to set up the charity 'Team Jak' which will offer additional support for youngsters battling cancer.

A call-out went viral on fans' websites yesterday.

Jak, a Rangers fan, was desperate to attend the game but family fear he is now too ill to make the journey. 

Jak has terminal T-Cell Lymphoma, which was diagnosed last August last year and he has since vowed to use his remaining time to raise money for a cancer charity

Breaking the news to his friends, he wrote: 'Well, that's it. 'Worse case scenario has happened. I have been preparing myself for this answer all day although it still came hard to take.

'My very experienced Doctors and Professors have looked at the PET scan from today and the disease has spread into all my bones and organs.

'They have decided not to go any further with any more treatment.'

He added that he has not been told how long he has left.

'I am so sorry to give everyone this horrible news but there's no other way to put it.

'I would like to thank all the doctors, nurses and everyone who has helped me over the past 6 months, they have tried their best for me.'

Jak, who is a goalie with Mid Calder Colts Under-16s, is desperate to be well enough to attend the Old Firm cup clash at Hampden today.

Fans yesterday paid tribute to the youngster with a standing round of applause.
