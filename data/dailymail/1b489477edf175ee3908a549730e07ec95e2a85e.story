A new website allows travellers to plan where to get the most striking selfies and holiday shots.

VueVoyage is a platform where tourists can find and capture the best views from destinations across the world, which are then rated by other users.

Because the images are not publicity photos, the website's creators hope it will offer a more realistic way for people to research the most picturesque holiday spots.

Described as 'Instagram meets TripAdvisor', they believe it will appeal to the growing trend of tech-savvy holidaymakers looking for ever more inspiring places to capture the ultimate selfie.

They also hope it will act as a reliable travel guide for tourists looking to plan future trips.

Users can browse the website by locations including cities and countries, or categories such as restaurants, golf courses, parks and architecture to find destinations with the most scenic views.

Alternatively, if users don't have anywhere specific in mind, they can browse the thumbnails on the world map to simply pick out views that catch the eye, or find the highest user-rated photos in a given area.

Each photo has a description of the view accompanied by its location on Google Maps and offers tips on where to snap the best view.

To submit photographs, users simply upload their image via an online submission form.

It takes a couple of days to be reviewed and uploaded before it is rated by the website's editors and fellow travellers using a scale of one to five.

A three or higher is a good score, while a five is reserved for the 'best of the best'.

The photos are a mix of user-submitted shots and 'VueVerified' pictures taken by the VueVoyage team.

The website also provides and encourages 'community tourism' - social media interaction between users who can swap comments about the images. 

Jon Goodman and Jennifer Trebisovsky are the website's creators. 

The couple decided to create a site where new and old traditions of travel sites are combined, and they say it is appealing to new adventurers and older, seasoned travellers.

They said: 'There are so many Instagram accounts, magazines, websites and articles covering breath-taking views from around the world, but most are professionally edited or taken by professional photographers.

'We pride ourselves on offering realistic and tangible views. Because the photos on our site are from everyday travellers, you know the view you are actually going to get when visiting those destinations. 

'You don't have to be a professional photographer to capture the views on our site.'

Mr Goodman added: 'My girlfriend and I built the site after realising that a lot of people our age were going places "for the photo", mainly to post on social media.'

The website proved popular with football fans visiting this year's World Cup in Brazil, and helped detail the must-see sights in the 12 cities where the tournament's matches were held. 

For example, one user who shot a picture of the sunset at Passauna Park in Curitiba, wrote alongside his image: 'View tip: Venture out for a kayak ride to maximize your views!' 

Another image taken during a climb to the Santuario Mae de Deus in Porto Alegre which featured panoramic views of the city below was accompanied by this advice: 'Make the trek at dusk or sunset.'
