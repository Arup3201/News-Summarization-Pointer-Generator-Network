Police believe they've finally closed a 17 year old cold case of an Illinois teen who was sexually assaulted, murdered and dumped in a Wisconsin swamp.

Amber Creek, 14, was found posed against a tree with the word 'hi' written on her hand in a wildlife refuge just days after she ran away from a shelter for abused and neglected children.

The runaway was known as only Jane Doe by Racine County investigators for the next 16 months, and only this past Saturday was an arrest made in the horrific 1997 case.

Cold case: Illinois 14-year-old Amber Creek was raped, murdered and dumped in the woods in a gruesome murder that went unsolved for 17 years

Police announced they planned to name the 36-year-old suspect at a press conference Monday.

'My investigators and I sifted through thousands of reports, and spent thousands of hours over the years trying to solve this senseless murder of a child,' Racine County Sheriff Christopher Schmaling told the Journal Times.

Creek was a ward of the state when her body was discovered naked from the waist down by two hunters on February 9. 1997.

It took nearly a year and a half for investigators to uncover her identity.

In addition to the haunting message left on Creek's palm, her killer stuck a $5 price tag from an area bookstore onto her arm.

'Today by far was the best moment for my investigative team as we informed Amberâ€™s dad that we caught her killer,' Schmaling said. 'It was an emotional exchange for everyone in the room.'

Creek was last seen getting into a gray luxury vehicle with a placard on the license plate that included the word 'mayor.'

A description of the white male driver allowed police in conjunction with America's Most Wanted to create a sketch of the suspect.

The sketch was shown on the air in a December 1998 episode of the crime stoppers series that dealt with Creek's murder.
