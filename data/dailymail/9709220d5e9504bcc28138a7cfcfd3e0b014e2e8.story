A teenager whose nurse mother killed herself after a hoax call to the hospital treating the Duchess of Cambridge has been named student of the year at his sixth form college.

Jacintha Saldanha, 46, was fooled into transferring a call by two Australian DJs to another nurse  at the hospital in London where pregnant Kate Middleton was being treated for acute morning sickness.

The mother-of-two was found dead in her nurses' quarters three days after the prank in December 2012.

Heartbroken son Junal Barboza, who uses his father Ben's surname, had just started the sixth form at the time.

But since then he has immersed himself in work to help him cope with the loss and been named student of the year at St Brendan's Sixth Form College in Bristol.

The 17-year-old, from Southmead, Bristol, said: 'I was shocked and honoured. I wouldn't say I was a model student. I just get on with things on a daily basis and don't do anything too outrageous.

'The support I got here was incredible and everyone was amazing. I had people to talk to and was greeted by my friends. It gave me cushioning when I came back to college.

'I came back as early as I could because if I had stayed at home I would have been thinking in a negative state.'

Junal is taking A-levels in design & technology and business, and AS-levels in physics and maths.

He is now hoping he will be able to attend a Russell Group University to study engineering, with Manchester his first choice.

He added: 'Hopefully, I will get good results so I can go onto one of the universities in the Russell Group. I hope I can achieve what I want to achieve.

'Ever since I was a young, I have wanted a career in engineering. My uncle was an engineer and he went all around the world with his work.'

Despite his loss, teachers at his college say Junal has continued to work hard and boasts an almost unblemished attendance record.

He was praised for his determination, strength of character and resilience when he was crowned the college's student of the year.

Ruth Pickersgill, the college's assistant head, said: 'Junal joined us two years ago and in his time here he has had to go through more adversity than most of us can possible imagine.

'He had to deal with the tragic loss of his mother in the glare of the world's media and throughout, along with the rest of his family, maintained a dignity and integrity.

'We have nominated him for this award as despite the barriers he has had to overcome, he has managed to maintain an attendance of 97 per cent this year and has continued studying hard and apply himself to his studies.

'He has shown a determination to keep going that is admirable and illustrates his strength of character and resilience.'

Three notes written by Mrs Saldanha were found after her death. An inquest is still waiting to be heard after originally being due to take place last autumn.

Following the prank, a hospital spokeswoman said both the nurses involved had been offered 'full support' and 'it was made clear they were victims of a cruel 
journalistic trick', she said.
