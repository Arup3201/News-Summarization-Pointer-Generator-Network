Alan Turing was 39 when he was prosecuted after he told the police that he was romantically involved with a 19-year-old man

To many it is regarded as the highlight of the classical music calendar.

But for pop duo Pet Shop Boys the Proms will become a platform to highlight the work of computer pioneer Alan Turing and to call for the ‘tens of thousands of men’ imprisoned or fined for committing homosexual acts to be pardoned.

Pet Shop Boys Neil Tennant and Chris Lowe will premiere their orchestral work A Man From The Future at the Proms on July 23.

The Pardon, the last song, refers to the posthumous pardon granted to Turing, who was prosecuted for gross indecency in 1952 after he admitted that he was sexually involved with a teenager.

Tennant and Lowe said that they are using the event to urge the Government to pardon others convicted before homosexuality was decriminalised in 1967.

‘So very many lives were ruined over such a long period,’ said Tennant.

Frankly it rather disappoints me that [the gay rights group] Stonewall has not done more. So we’re making the statement ourselves.’

The pair will be accompanied by the BBC Concert Orchestra and the BBC Singers. Actress Juliet Stevenson will narrate.

The Pardon will mention Gordon Brown, who as Prime Minister in 2009 apologised for the ‘appalling treatment’ of Turing after he innocently told police he had been in a sexual relationship with a man.

Despite his code breaking work at Bletchley Park during the Second World War and his ground-breaking research in computer science, Turing pleaded guilty to the charge of gross indecency and was chemically castrated as an alternative to prison.

He committed suicide two years later, aged 41, although his mother believed his death was an accident.

Tennant and Lowe were inspired to write about Turing by a 2011 TV documentary on his life.

‘It’s a memorial to Turing, invoking the spirit of the man and his work,’ Tennant told The Sunday Times. ‘He was a man from the future in that his scientific achievements were in the vanguard and that, for us, his pioneering work on computers led to our electronic music.

‘Then he was ahead of his time in being openly gay, though perhaps a bit too honest when he told the policeman, when he need not have done, about his sexuality.’
