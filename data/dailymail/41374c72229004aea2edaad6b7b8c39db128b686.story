Boston Red Sox pitcher Curt Schilling has revealed that the cancer he has been treated for since February is in remission.

The three-time World Series champion updated his fans through social media on Wednesday, as he thanked the Boston medical team treating him.

Schilling has not said what cancer had been diagnosed, but he had been adamant from the start that he would not be letting the disease beat him.

Relief: A tweet sent by Schilling on Wednesday announced that the baseball star was in remission

The 47-year-old, who worked as an analyst for ESPN after retiring from baseball, has posted regular updates on his cancer treatment in recent months.

When he announced he was in remission, the post was retweeted 2,500 times, and 'favorited' by more than 5,000 followers.

In April, his daughter Gabby shared a photo on Twitter of Schilling receiving his last bout of chemotherapy.

'Beyond blessed to be able to say that my dad finished his LAST chemo today! just 3 more days of radiation,' she tweeted.

Schilling had told fans in February that he had cancer, and that he planned to 'embrace this fight, just like the rest of them, with resolute faith, and head on'.

In a statement released by ESPN on his behalf at the time, Schilling said: 'With my incredibly talented medical team I'm ready to try and win another big game.'

Champion: Schilling pitches at a Red Sox game in 2007. The three-times World Series star has been fighting cancer since February

On May 28, Schilling received a 
loud ovation from Fenway Park fans during a pre-game ceremony honoring 
members of the 2004 team that won the Red Sox first championship in 86 
years.

Like the other players, he walked in from the left-field wall. 
His son Gehrig was by his side.

The baseball champion who now coaches his daughter's team has won the World Series three times, with a 2001 win with the Arizona Diamondbacks and two victories with the Red Sox in 2004 and 2007.

After pitching in the 2007 World Series, Schilling suffered reversals on and off the field. His 2-1 victory in Game 2 of Boston's four-game sweep of the Colorado Rockies was his last game.

He spent the entire 2008 season on the disabled list after right shoulder surgery and retired in March 2009.

He started an ill-fated video game company, 38 Studios, and later said he invested and lost as much as $50 million.

Its collapse is the subject of a lawsuit in Rhode Island after it got a $75 million state-guaranteed loan.
