Human rights lawyers have threatened doctors who have removed asylum seekers from surgery lists

GPs are being warned that they face legal action if they refuse to accept illegal immigrants as patients.

Human rights lawyers have been threatening doctors who have removed failed asylum seekers from their surgery lists – even though they are not entitled to free NHS care.

Meanwhile, figures reveal that foreigners, including tourists and migrants, have been given an estimated £40million of free NHS treatment in the past three years.

Anyone who does normally live  in the UK – including tourists – is meant to pay for any NHS treatment they receive. The only exceptions are urgent care received in A&E departments or treatment for certain infectious diseases such as tuberculosis.

Refugees and asylum seekers are given free NHS treatment, but if their application to remain in the UK is turned down by the Home Office they lose the entitlement.

But government guidelines on when to provide free healthcare are vague and simply advise GPs to ‘use their discretion’.

Figures obtained by Pulse magazine show that some hospitals are managing to claw back only a quarter of the costs owed to them by so-called health tourists.

Its investigation also revealed that one surgery in Essex had been ordered to reinstate two failed  asylum seekers from Nigeria after being threatened with legal action by human rights solicitors.

Doctors had removed the couple after their asylum application  had been turned down by the Home Office. But they subsequently received a letter from Bristol-based law firm Pierce Glynn threatening legal action unless they were reinstated, and they have now been put back on the books.

The manager of the surgery said that they were urged by their local primary care trust to reinstate the patients. The unnamed member of staff said: ‘Someone at the PCT read the letter and panicked.

'Hospital trusts must put in place arrangements that ensure people cannot exploit the system.'

‘Do we just register everyone who is illegal?’

Another practice in Leeds was also told not to remove illegal immigrants in the face of similar threats.

Tory MP Chris Skidmore, who sits on the Health Select Committee, accused lawyers of ‘piggy backing’ on the NHS. He said: ‘GPs are under enough pressure. They should not be made to feel accountable for not registering people who have no legal right to treatment.

‘I fear this is only the tip of the iceberg. In many cases, staff may not be asking people’s nationality as it is beyond the hospital or clinic to recover the costs of treatment.

Refugees and asylum seekers are given 
free NHS treatment, but if their application to remain in the UK is 
turned down by the Home Office they lose the entitlement.

‘Given that NHS resources are going to be stretched, these are savings which should be made.’

Dr Richard Vautrey, of the British Medical Association, said: ‘Hospital trusts must put in place arrangements that ensure people cannot exploit the system.’

The investigation obtained data from 35 hospital trusts in England showing that on average they had debts of £230,000 owed by foreigners since 2009. If that figure is replicated across all 168 hospital trusts in the country, then the NHS would collectively be owed £40million from health tourists.

This included St George’s Healthcare Trust in London, which had recovered only £1.5 million from the £3.5 million owed. Another trust, Royal Wolverhampton in the West Midlands, had managed to recover only 24 per cent of the £419,000 owed by foreign nationals.

Health minister Simon Burns said: ‘We won’t tolerate abuse of our National Health Service. The NHS has a duty to anyone whose life or long-term health is at immediate risk, but it is not there to serve the health needs of the globe.’
