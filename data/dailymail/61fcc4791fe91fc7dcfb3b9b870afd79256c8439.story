A flight attendant working for budget airline jetBlue has admitted to accepting $10,000 to smuggle heroin disguised as chocolate pellets into the country from Colombia.

Carla Michelle Alvarado was caught by customs officers coming off a flight from Bogota to Orlando with 940 grams - or just over two pounds - of the powerful street drug split across several oval pellets that were colored brown to look like candy.

Alvarado, from Kissimmee, Florida, had hidden the items in a garment underneath her flight attendant uniform.

In happier times: Carla Alvarado, in a photo from Facebook, was caught with just over two pounds of heroin hidden underneath her fliight attendant uniform following a flight from Bogota, Colombia, to Orlando. She then went undercover for police to catch the dealer that was paying her $10,000 for the smuggle

Alvarado told agents she was given the 
drugs in Colombia and was being paid $10,000 to deliver the heroin to 
Jorge Luis Alomar, an acquaintance in Orlando.

She then agreed to help agents with their investigation and complete the delivery.

Alvarado and Alomar had planned to meet a restaurant near the airport to make the hand off.

Once Alomar had accepted what he thought was a bag of heroin from Alvarado, police swooped in.

Alomar told agents he coordinates heroin
shipments from a source in Bogota and said he asked Alvarado for help 
in moving the drugs, according to the Orlando Sentinel.

Alomar said Alvarado had also transported another package of heroin for him about weeks earlier,for which he paid her $10,000.

Agents asked Alomar if he had any other drugs, and he said he had more heroin hidden in his home in Davenport.

Agents took Alomar to his house, 
where he moved a dresser, pulled up the carpet and removed a bag 
containing about 165 grams of heroin. In his bathroom, Alomar removed a 
ceiling vent cover and pulled out bags containing about 55 grams of 
heroin.

Alvarado and Alomar were arrested on a
charge of conspiracy to distribute a controlled substance, and both 
made their first appearance in Orlando federal court on Monday.

Alomar remains jailed in Orange County.

Alvarado was granted bail.
