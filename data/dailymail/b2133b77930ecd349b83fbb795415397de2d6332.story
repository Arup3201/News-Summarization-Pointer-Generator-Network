Firefighters in a small New Jersey town have come under attack from officials and residents after hanging a banner reading: 'Show us your t**s.'

The all-volunteer team displayed the lewd sign below the Williamstown Fire Company's emblem at the state's Fireman's Convention in Wildwood last weekend.

Former EMT Shawn Rutter saw the sign at the event and sent a photo to the South Jersey Times.

Offensive: The Williamstown Fire Company posted this sign asking women to show them their breasts at a firefighters' convention at the weekend. Residents have expressed their shock at the poor choice

'I think it's demoralizing to women,' Rutter told the paper. 'I think it's insulting. A lot of young kids idolize that type of work. Every little kid wants to be a firefighter. A lot of parents drive their kids to that parade. That's not a conducive learning environment.'

The mayor of the South Jersey town, who has called for suspensions of those responsible for the poor choice, said it did not represent the Gloucester County town the right way.

'We're investigating,' Monroe Township Mayor Michael Gabbianelli told NBC4. 'Somebody will be suspended when we find out all the answers. It's embarrassing for everybody.' 

Residents said they were horrified when they saw the sign. 

Not impressed: Monroe Township Mayor Michael Gabbianelli, pictured, said an investigation was underway to determine who was responsible and that there would be suspensions once they got to the bottom of it

'I thought it was completely inappropriate and distasteful and I was shocked,' Rebecca Budney, a Williamstown resident, told the channel. 

Others said the firefighters had set a terrible example.  

'When kids see it and they pick it up and they go around saying it to girls - it's not good,' said another resident, Heather Camperchioli. 

Rutter, who snapped the photo, added: 'I commend everybody that's a policeman or fireman or EMT. But I think somebody made a bad call and it needs to not happen again.'

After the outcry, President Joseph Kurz and Chief Michael Jacobi from the fire company posted an apology on its website beneath a picture of the words 'So Sorry' written in sand.

'We would like to offer the fire company's sincere apologies to those who were offended by the inappropriate banner,' their statement read. 

Let down: Shocked residents said that the firefighters at the Williamstown firehouse, pictured, had let the community down by setting a poor example for children who look up to them

'While attendance at the annual convention has always been a festive occasion for our volunteers, unfortunately a few individuals of our organization exercised poor judgment posting an inappropriate banner.

'The Williamstown Fire Company has a long standing tradition of honorable service and commitment to the township. Our volunteers are dedicated to the safety and security of our residents.

 'We ask the general public to not assess our organization through a single display of poor judgment but by the dedicated commitment of all the volunteers who proudly and unselfishly serve our community.'

The statement added that officials are investigating to ensure it never happens again.
