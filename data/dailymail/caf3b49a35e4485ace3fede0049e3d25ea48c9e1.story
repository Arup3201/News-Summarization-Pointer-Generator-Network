This is the extraordinary moment a seal snuggles up with a golden Labrador on a beach in France.

In the footage shot by Elise Frebourg it shows the seal - christened 'You' by locals - shuffling over to the Labrador lying on the sand. 

The seal then pats the dog with its paw before nuzzling up to the Labrador in the heart-warming scene.

Since the video from Le Cap Ferret, in south west France, was uploaded last week, it has already been viewed more than 100,000 times.

This is not the first time 'You' has attracted publicity for his boldness in front of the cameras. 

Last month, the attention-seeking seal was filmed climbing over surfers and their boards in Lacanau, France.   

The footage, captured by Bertrand Chaussade using a camera mounted on his surf board, shows the seal repeatedly approaching him and swimming over his board.

'He played with us for the whole morning. He would climb on my board, ask for strokes and push me over. It was like playing with a little dog, it was a very playful and loving animal. It was a beautiful encounter and a magical moment' Mr Chaussade later wrote online.
