Norman Tebbit today revealed his great regret at quitting Margaret Thatcher's government, leaving her 'at the mercy of her friends'.

The former Tory party chairman bemoaned how Baroness Thatcher was ousted from power not by the voters but by her Conservative colleagues.

Staring down the chamber towards former Foreign Secretary, Lord Howe of Aberavon, whose dramatic resignation sparked the Iron Lady's political demise in 1990, Lord Tebbit told peers he wished he had stood by her.

Former Tory chairman Lord Tebbit recalled the Brighton bombing in which he and his wife were injured, and expressed regret that Baroness Thatcher was ousted from power by her own Conservative colleagues

He also spoke movingly of the IRA bomb in 1984, in which he was injured and his wife Margaret was paralysed. Three years later he stood down from the Cabinet, to look after his wife.

He told the Lords: 'My regrets? I think I do regret that 
because of the commitments I had made to my own wife that I did not feel
able either to continue in Government after 1987 or to return to 
Government when she later asked me to do and I left her, I fear, at the 
mercy of her friends. That I do regret.'

He added that he was grateful for how she allowed him to run his office 'from my hospital bed' for three months while he recovered from his injuries.

Baroness Thatcher joined the House of Lords in 1992 after standing down as an MP

'I would like to say how 
grateful I will always be for the fact that she gave me the opportunity 
to serve in high office the country that she and I, and I believe all of
us here, love,' he said.

And in a swipe at the Tory MPs who refused to back her as leader in 1990, Lord Tebbit said: 'She was brought 
down in the end not by the electorate, but by her colleagues.

'Not only is it quite 
remarkable that she won three elections running - someone else has done 
that since - what was remarkable is that she polled slightly more votes 
on the occasion of her third victory when she had been in office eight 
years than on her first and I regard that as a triumph for her.'He said his life as Conservative Party chairman was made much easier by 'the certainty of her beliefs'.

'I was never asked by her to commission a focus group," he said. 'Had I been so, I would have resisted manfully.'

But he said he had not always agreed with her. 'I recollect one occasion when I left her office in No 10, walked back over to Victoria Street, got into my office and asked my private secretary if there had been any calls from No 10.

'No, secretary of state,' he said. So I knew I was still the secretary of state.'

Former Tory leader Lord Howard of Lympne said: 'There are very, very few people who have made a difference on the scale Margaret Thatcher achieved. She saved our country, she helped bring freedom to half our continent. The light of her legacy will shine like a beacon down the generations.'

He added: 'It has said many times that she was a divisive figure. She was, she had to be. There was no consensus about the right thing to do to save our country.

'And if she had waited for consensus nothing would ever have happened. She saw what needed to be done and she did it, with clarity, with courage, with conviction.'

Conservative leader in the Lords, Lord Hill, lead the debate telling peers: 'Whatever our views and whatever our backgrounds, I think we would all agree that she made a huge difference to the country she loved, that she helped to pick Britain up off its knees, that she changed our place in the world and that she transformed the very shape of our political debate.

'And I think we would also agree that she was a staunch defender of our parliamentary system and the part it should play in our national life.'

Speeches: Lord Howard and Lord Ashdown also took to their feet to praise the Iron Lady and share memories

Former Lib Dem leader Paddy Ashdown hailed Baroness Thatcher as 'without doubt the commanding politician and greatest Prime Minister of our age'.

Lord Ashdown said she restored the UK's position in the world and was far better than any man in politics.

And he revealed the surprise reaction of his left-leaning wife, Jane, on meeting Baroness Thatcher at a Downing Street reception. Lady Ashdown remarked: 'She's absolutely bloody charming, dammit!'

Lord McNally, in a speech peppered 
with humour and greeted with warm laughter from many in the House, 
recalled sitting next to Lady Thatcher in 2003, the year her husband 
died and a year after she suffered a series of minor strokes.

'By some reason of serendipity for 
about five years, at the state opening of Parliament, I found myself 
sitting on that bench there next to Mrs Thatcher and spending time with 
her before we awaited the Queen's arrival,' the leader of the Lib Dems 
in the Lords said.

'The one thing I want to share with 
the House was in the year her husband died and when she had already had a
number of minor strokes and she didn't speak a great deal.

'But suddenly she turned to me and said 'My husband died earlier this year'.

'And I said 'Yes, I know Baroness Thatcher'.

'She paused again and then said "I miss him very much".'

Tribute: One peer, Lord McNally, described how Lady Thatcher and Denis were a 'tremendous partnership' and told how, after he died, the former PM said how much she missed her husband

Mr Thatcher was 'absolutely central' and key to Lady Thatcher's ability to become what she was, Baroness Williams said.

'According to Sir Denis Thatcher, at one stage he was sitting at home in his flat in Flood Street and Mrs Thatcher was ironing his shirt, something she was very keen on doing, getting breakfast, ironing his shirt,' Lady Williams said.

'She said in a rather casual sort of way 'Denis, I'm thinking of running for the leadership', to which he responded 'leadership of what Margaret?'

'That somehow summed up the wonderful balance, detachment and humour of Sir Denis and I can't undermine too strongly the extent to which I think Mrs Thatcher began to lose her life when he passed away.

'He was absolutely central and key to her whole personality, the ability to become what she was.'

Lady Williams, who sat opposite Lady Thatcher on the Commons front benches as a Labour minister during the 1970s, said she disagreed with her policies which were 'terribly hard on the industrial North and the industrial Midlands'.

She also criticised Lady Thatcher for not embracing other cultures.

'I think her policies did not completely reflect the common ground that we were beginning to develop as a multi-cultural and multi-racial nation and to me that is a very important part of what we are about today.'

Views: Baroness Williams also spoke movingly about Margaret Thatcher's relationship with Denis and his unfailing support for her in their 52 years of marriage

Labour's Baroness Royall of Blaisdon admitted that many on the left still feel angry towards Baroness Thatcher, even three decades after she became Prime Minister.

'For some, including some on my benches and in my part of the political spectrum, Mrs Thatcher, as she was then, was someone who was a divisive figure, someone to whom they were and remain fundamentally opposed,' the Labour peer said.

'Someone whose very name, even now, more than 30 years since she became Britain's prime minister in 1979, can raise heights of emotion, of passion, of anger, despair, and more. Someone who they believe can never be forgiven for what she did to individuals, to communities, to industries, and to the country.

'That is a legitimate position of disagreement to hold - but to hold parties to celebrate a death of someone is wrong and in bad taste, and something I deplore.'
