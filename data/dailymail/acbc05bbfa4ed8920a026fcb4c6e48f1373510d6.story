A former Great Britain rugby league star pinned a woman to a bed and raped her after a New Year's Eve party when he was at the height of his career, a court heard today.

Gareth Raynor, 40, of Pontefract, West Yorkshire, is accused of raping the woman and putting his arms across her throat following a New Year's Eve party in East Yorkshire in 2006.

A jury at Hull Crown Court heard today how Raynor is also accused of an attack on another woman in Featherstone, in which he allegedly slashed her thigh with a bread knife.

The former Leeds Rhinos and Hull FC winger has pleaded not guilty to both the charge of rape and unlawful wounding.

Opening the prosecution case today, Crown barrister Matthew Bean said Raynor was a well-known rugby player who had played for Bradford Bulls, Leeds Rhinos, Featherstone Rovers, Leicester Tigers and represented Great Britain from 2005 to 2008.

He said that although Raynor was described as a shy man, he could be controlling, aggressive and violent towards women.

He told the court about the two offences of which Raynor is accused.

Speaking about the alleged rape, Mr Bean said the alleged victim remembered being pinned down with her arms above her head and Raynor using his other arm to pin her by the throat.

He told the court: 'She said he put his arm over her throat, so she could not speak.

'She was trying to say no, but was not able to say anything. She was crying and attempting to say no.

'In an effort to get him off, she bit his chest. He did not speak throughout the whole incident.'

Mr Bean also told the court about the alleged assault on a woman in Featherstone, which occurred in April 2007.

He said: 'During the course of an argument he [Raynor] picked up a bread knife from the kitchen and returned with it.

'She said she was screaming at him to put the knife away.'

He told the court how others in the property were alerted to the scene but the victim warned them away only to be attacked when they left.

Mr Bean added: 'He used the knife to slash the top of her thigh. She remembers the pain. She said she yelped like a dog.

'She simply curled up in a ball.'

Mr Bean said the woman did not report the charge of wounding at the time and, when questioned about it, Raynor said they had been playing a game of 'dare'.

The woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, did not initially seek medical attention but was advised to go to hospital after telling her boss about the incident at work the following day.

Mr Bean told the court how neither incident was reported to police until September 2013.

He said that during police interview, Raynor denied the rape allegation and claimed it was a lie.

Raynor became a GB International after first playing for Leeds Rhinos and then Hull FC.

The court heard he played 158 times over an eight-year period for rugby league outfit Hull FC.

He was released by Hull and joined the new-look Welsh Crusaders Rugby League club on Boxing Day 2009.

In September the following year, he signed a one-year deal with Bradford Bulls and in July 2013 he signed a year-long contract with London Skolars.

He became a star for GB team winning six caps and scored the match winning try in the 2006 Tri Nations win over Australia.

The trial continues.
