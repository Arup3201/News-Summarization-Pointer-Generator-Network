A defiant grandmother is refusing to sell her home to make way for a massive Tesco car park despite every other house on the street being sold for demolition.

Enid Jones, 58, is the last remaining resident on a street which the supermarket chain wants to bulldoze to make way for a new superstore.

She made her 'Enid v Goliath' lone stand against the multinational giant - and refused to move as all 11 of her neighbours agreed to sell up and go.

The council approved plans for the giant supermarket and issued a compulsory purchase order which will see her lose her home in the seaside resort of Aberystwyth, West Wales.

But she took her fight to the Welsh Government who are holding an planning inquiry on whether she can be kicked out.

She told the hearing in Aberystwyth: 'Leave me in peace, leave my house alone.'

The council have already approved plans to flatten Mrs Jones' road to make way for a shopping park with Tesco and Marks and Spencer stores.

The local council claim the shops will employ 295 full-time workers, generating around £2.95m in wages for the local economy.

The two superstores could open by December 2016 and could boost town centre trade by between £1.6m and £3.5m a year.

Mrs Jones' lawyer Glyn Pritchard-Jones said: 'She is still opposed to her house being demolished.'

'Mrs Jones thinks the Tesco development can be delivered without the need to demolish properties.'

The Welsh Government are expected to issue a report before making their final decision in three months time

A spokesman for Marks & Spencer said: 'We have plans to open a new store in Aberystwyth at the Mill Street development, subject to the public consultation between the site developer and local council.'

MailOnline has approached Tesco for comment.
