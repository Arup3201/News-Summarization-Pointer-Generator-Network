A bizarre neighbourly feud between two men over a pile of rubbish has been captured on camera and viewed by thousands of internet users.

A passing postman filmed the warring neighbours in action as they each carried bin bags to opposite sides of the road, without uttering a word to each other.

The battle was thought to have sparked because neither of the two men had wanted the filled bags to be outside their homes, and so decided to move the rubbish to the other side of the street.

Bizarre: A neighbourly feud between two men over a pile of rubbish has been captured on camera

Clash: The two men were caught on camera hauling rubbish from one side of a street to the other following a dispute over the bin bags

However, both of their attempts to 
haul the rubbish away from their houses proved futile, as the other man 
would simply return it to where it had started.

In
the short clip, filmed by postman Pete Sykes, the two men, one dressed 
in jeans and a black jacket, and the other in a brown coat and woolly 
hat, can be seen silently criss-crossing across the street armed with 
purple bin bags.

Meanwhile Mr Sykes and his fellow postmen can be heard chuckling hysterically as they watched the drama unfold.

Mr Sykes, a former footballer with Dover Athletic dubbed the battle 'rubbish tennis', after he filmed the dispute in Granville Street, Dover, Kent.

Stand-off: The battle was thought to have sparked because neither of the two men had wanted the filled bags to be outside their homes

Futile: In the clip one man could be seen taking rubbish across the road, only for his neighbour to return it

In the footage Mr Sykes can be heard to say 'There are two guys here arguing over what rubbish should be on what side of the road.

'Should it be outside his house, or should it be outside my house? Absolute class.'

Mr Sykes caught the 'clash of the trash' on Thursday morning and since he uploaded the clip to YouTube it has been viewed  more than 27,000 times.

'It's so funny,' the 33-year-old told 
local paper the Dover Express. 'They were doing it for around half an 
hour. But they didn't even argue.'

Dispute: The battle of the bin bags continued for half an hour, with the men refusing to speak to one another throughout

Captured: The dispute was filmed by postman Pete Sykes as he and his colleagues watched the drama unfold

The married father said that he and his 
colleagues could not wait to return to the housing development next week
to find out if the feud had been resolved.

YouTube viewers were also keen to watch the next instalment.

Sykowarrior6 wrote on the video's comments section: 'Can't wait for next weeks bin day... #veryentertaining'.

Postman Royalmail added: 'Where's the Benny Hill music?'

While viewer Seri M suggested: 'just put it to the other neighbours wall.'
