The BBC could be included in a move to limit media ownership, the Government announced yesterday.

Culture Secretary Maria Miller launched a consultation on rules governing media plurality, asking for the first time whether the state broadcaster should be covered.

If the BBC was included in rules designed to prevent any one media organisation becoming too powerful, it could be forced to rein in its dominant news website.

While the BBC produces 25 per cent of the news broadcast on television, it accounts for 73 per cent of TV news viewing.

Similarly, across all platforms, the 
BBC reaches 86 per cent of people who read or watch news content – 
compared to 40 per cent for ITV, 28 per cent for Sky and 27 per cent for
News Corp.

The consultation points out the BBC 
is the biggest provider of news on TV, radio and the internet – spending
£430million on news and current affairs in 2011, more than the rest of 
the UK’s broadcasters combined – but has never been included in a market
plurality review.

The Department for Culture, Media and 
Sport said: ‘As a major player in the market, the BBC has a significant 
impact on the overall range and scale of provision.

‘As such, we consider that a 
measurement framework should assess the BBC’s impact on plurality. [This
is] distinct from the question of whether the BBC should be subject to 
any new plurality regulation.’

Labour has suggested there should be a
15 per cent cap of ownership across newspapers, broadcasting companies 
and online sites, though it has fiercely defended the BBC’s dominant 
position.

Currently, no one can own more than 20
per cent of a Channel 3 licence and national newspapers with more than 
20 per cent of market share at the same time, while political parties 
are prohibited from holding any broadcasting licences.

The existing rules, based largely on 
newspaper circulation, are seen as outdated.

Before the closure of the 
News of the World in 2011, News International held 37 per cent of the 
newspaper market.

The Government has the power to 
implement a public interest test, enabling ministers to intervene in 
media mergers where there are concerns about media plurality.

Mrs Miller has launched a 12-week 
consultation on what should be included in any new framework, including 
the BBC and social media sites such as Facebook and Twitter.

The BBC says it should be excluded from media plurality calculations because of its public service role.
