Ian McLoughlin is an 'astonishingly bright' man who has a violent hatred of gay men despite being bisexual himself

A murderer on the run after a knife attack at a paedophile’s home has a fixation with child sex offenders, his ex-wife said yesterday.

Convicted double killer Ian McLoughlin, 55, is suspected of a third fatal attack after he was allowed out of jail on day release.

He was 21 years into a 25-year minimum sentence – the second time he was let out of prison early, having been freed five years into an eight-year sentence in 1989.

Ex-wife Janette Adams, 57, wed McLoughlin in 1983 after he was released from a prison sentence for theft, but they divorced that year after he was arrested for killing a gay man.

He was later given eight years for manslaughter.

Mrs Adams said McLoughlin – who had reportedly worked as a rent boy – lived on the streets after his parents threw him out at 13.

She added: ‘He seems to be very troubled and to have a fixation with paedophiles.

'Considering his past I’m not overly shocked at events that followed. I’ve not heard from him for 35 years.’ 

McLoughlin is on the run after the death of Graham Buck, 66, on Saturday at the home of a paedophile the killer had met in jail, Old Etonian Francis Cory-Wright, 87.

McLoughlin was allegedly robbing Cory-Wright when he is believed to have been interrupted by Mr Buck, who went to help after hearing shouting in Little Gaddesden, Hertfordshire.

McLoughlin is suspected of stabbing Mr Buck before fleeing with thousands of pounds.

He is then thought to have walked into National Trust mansion Ashridge House and asked a member of staff to call him a taxi, which he took to a pub in Watford.

Wanted: Ian McLoughlin is believed to have met convicted paedophile Francis Cory-Wright, 88, in prison, and this was when he was last seen over the weekend at a hotel

Yesterday, the man who put him behind bars in 1992 for life with a minimum term of 25 years for the murder of his gay landlord asked why he had been allowed out.

Retired Detective Superintendent Mike Bennison said: ‘Bearing in mind his previous character he should have stayed behind bars for the rest of his life.’

It also emerged that convicted 
killer McLoughlin – now the focus of a ‘massive manhunt’ has an IQ of 
140 and is described as 'astonishingly bright'. Anyone with a IQ above 
this is considered a ‘genius’.

The
killer has already served one sentence for killing one gay man, and was
22 years into a second jail term for murdering another homosexual.

McLoughlin, who also uses the surname
Baker, absconded on Saturday while on day release from an open prison 
where he is serving a 25-year sentence for murdering homosexual Peter 
Halls, 55, in 1990, just months after he finished a jail term for 
another homophobic killing.

He murdered Mr Halls by stabbing him 
through the neck while he lay face down on a bed in 1990, seven years 
after he killled Len Delgatty, 49, in Stoke Newington, north London.  Mr Delgatty, who 
was also gay, was battered with a hammer before being strangled with a 
tourniquet and then left upside down to drown in his own blood.

McLoughlin,
who is bisexual but is said to hate gay men, fled the scene but later 
crashed his car while drunk and was found to have used Mr Delgatty's 
credit card.

McLoughlin was charged with murder but 
convicted of manslaughter after claiming he was incensed by Mr Delgatty 
playing him a tape in which he fantasised about having sex with a 
teenage boy.  The alleged tape was never found.
