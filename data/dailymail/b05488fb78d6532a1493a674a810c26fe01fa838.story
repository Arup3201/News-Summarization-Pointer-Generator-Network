David Luiz believes Bastia forward Brandao's headbutt set a terrible example and was unacceptable.

Paris Saint-Germain midfielder Thiago Motta has a suspected broken nose from Brandao's headbutt following Laurent Blanc's side's 2-0 victory. 

Video footage revealed Brandao waitied for Motta in the tunnel after the final whistle, smashing his forehead into Motta's face before running away.

Motta had to be held back by his team-mates with blood streaming from his nose following the altercation. Zlatan Ibrahimovic also hobbled off injured during an eventful game shortly before the incident occurred.

Luiz said: 'We have a great job in the world to show a good example inside and outside the pitch. I think many kids in the world want to be us so they know about everything.

'That is not part of football. I don't agree with this.

'Sometimes on the pitch you are more vulnerable with something and they speak bad things but that's normal in football.

'But when you wait for someone outside the pitch to do a bad thing, I think that's not [acceptable]. That's not part of football.

'So I'm not happy with this because, after that, everyone in the world knows about this and, like I told you, that's so important when you give a nice example for the kids.'

PSG president Nasser Al-Khelaifi reiterated Luiz's stance and said Brandao should be 'banned for life'.

He also added that he would be filing a report to the French Football Federation requesting strong action to be taken against the 34 year old.

Thiago Silva also took to instagram to express his desire to see Brandao receive strong punishment for his actions after a history of causing problems off the field.
