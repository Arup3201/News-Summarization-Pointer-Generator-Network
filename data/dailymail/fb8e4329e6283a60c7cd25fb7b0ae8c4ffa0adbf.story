A Sydney woman who racked up credit card debt of nearly $200,000, but was still able to turn her life around, has given her advice on how to bounce back from financial ruin.

Originally from Canada, Alice Crawley racked up $100,000 on credit cards in her homeland before coming to Australia 15 years ago and adding $85,000 of debt to that.

‘I was only earning $50,000 per year, but was completely out of control with money and was a chronic over-spender on credit cards,’ she explained.

After racking up a credit card debt of nearly $200,000 Alice Crawley was at her wit's end

‘So I just continued to get credit cards, and even got bank loans out to cover the credit card debt, only to max them out as well. It was a drastic situation.

‘I was doing office work and administrative roles which were really beneath my capabilities, but this was my basic problem – I totally undervalued myself despite having a university education. I’d absolutely no sense of self-worth.’

Scaling down her spending and being more realistic put Alice back on the road to redemption

Because of her self-esteem issues and the stress the debt was putting her under; Alice would spend to make herself feel better. Of course, this just worsened the situation and sent her life flying into a downward spiral.

Nothing was too much. She’d splash out on luxury holidays to the likes of Hawaii and Fiji, while if she stayed in Australia she would holiday in the likes of Byron Bay and book into the plushest hotel there. There were expensive spa treatments, extravagant nights out in trendy restaurants, lavish gifts for herself and her friends – the spending was never-ending.

But none of it made her feel better. Because of the shame she felt over her continuing debt she put on a front of being successful and wealthy when she was anything but that.

‘I was filled with so much fear and self-loathing. I’d spend all this money to compensate for my lack of self-worth,’ Alice said.

‘I was feeling desperate and out of control. I was totally overwhelmed. But after unburdening myself to a friend and admitting I had a problem, I vowed to turn my life around.’

Alice sat down and made up a plan. After educating herself on financial strategies and techniques to change her mindset with money, she more than tripled her income in the space of a year by working in better jobs.

It then took a few years to get her credit rating back to normal. She did this by using only cash and direct debit . Because of all she’d experienced, Alice went into financial coaching to help other women who were suffering with money problems. 

After being told she’d have to declare bankruptcy, in four years, she paid off all the debt. She now helps women redefine their relationship with money, which is the most common roadblock to long-term financial freedom.

Alice believes we live in a society where we're all encouraged to overspend and live the highlife

‘I have five basic tips about how to turn around your money problems,” Alice said.

‘Firstly, pre-plan when you're going to do your shopping and stick to that schedule. Avoid the shops when you're stressed, overtired or hungry.

‘Apply the three D strategy: DECIDE, DISTRACT, DELAY - decide to walk away, distract yourself with another activity or delay the urge -give it 24 hours and sleep on it.

‘Set a spending plan and shopping list and stick to it.

‘Use cash and direct debit rather than credit. When buying gifts carry cash in an envelope with the person's name on it and only spend what's in the envelope for that person.

‘Finally, be mindful of what you are spending money on over the holidays, tally up your spending at the end of each week so that you are aware of where your money is going. Put stop gaps in place where necessary.’

She believed the tips were even more essential now as we come up to Christmas and the holiday period, especially for women.

Alice always had lavish holidays to Hawaii and Fiji despite her secret financial woes  

‘It’s so loaded with expectation. There’s so much pressure to go out and spend a lot of money around the holidays,’ Alice said.

The annual Stress and Wellbeing in Australia Survey 2014 conducted by the Australian Psychological Society (APS) released on Tuesday has found 53% of Australian women say personal finances are a major source of stress.

‘A lot of women are dealing with low wages and overspending. It is a vicious circle because you get so down about the debt you’re in; you spend to make yourself feel better. You have to take responsibility for your situation and plan ahead,’ she said.

Alice also believed banks and retailers were also a big part of the problem.

‘We live in a society where you are encouraged to overspend. Despite the fact I was only earning $50,000 per year, these banks still gave me a $10,000 credit limit, which was an exorbitant amount. It was one fifth of my salary. Yet they continued to extend my credit willingly,’ she said.

Alice has already launched www.alicecrawley.com and has a rapidly growing community presence and following across Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.

She has released 12 free episodes of Alice TV, inspiring women to find their own way out of the rabbit hole of debt. While in February 2015, she will be launching her first online program ‘Rich, Happy and Free’.
