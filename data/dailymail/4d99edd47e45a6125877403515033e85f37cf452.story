Monica, Rachel, Chandler, Joey, Pheobe and Ross spent endless hours sitting on that familiar orange couch drinking  coffee, and now you can too - if you happen to be in New York this month.

A real-life version of the famous Friends hangout Central Perk opened on Wednesday to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the hit sitcom series, which premiered on September 22, 1994.

A queue stretched down the street as fans waited for their chance to recreate the iconic coffee shop scenes made famous by actors Jennifer Aniston, Courteney Cox, Matt LeBlanc, Lisa Kudrow, David Schwimmer and Matthew Perry during the show's ten-year run.

While none of the six lead castmembers showed up for the opening, James Michael Tyler - who played Central Perk's barista Gunther - was on hand to meet and greet fans.

The actor will also make an appearance when the pop-up shop closes on October 18. 

The very same orange couch that featured in almost every episode as the characters hung out and drank coffee is on display, with fans taking turns to sit and have their picture taken on it.

Also in-store are pieces of show memorabilia, such as Monica's engagement ring, Chandler's wedding vows, Phoebe's sister Ursula's sex tape, and Joey's Soap Digest cover.

Ross' laminated list of celebrities he would be allowed to sleep with even if he was in a relationship is on show - though eagle-eyed fans may notice that this version includes Isabella Rossellini, who in fact didn't make the cut for the final, laminated version in the episode.

Joey's ceramic statue, Pat the Dog, and the gold frame from Monica's apartment door are also available to view. 

Memorable: Some costumes worn by the cast, including Monica's see-through blouse, Ross' leather trousers, and Rachel's outfit from the finale are on display

Props: Memorabilia from the show are available to view, including Monica and Chandler's wedding vows, and Ross' list of celebrities he'd like to sleep with... but eagle-eyed fans may notice something amiss with the list

Remember these? Joey's Soap Digest cover, Monica and Chandler's wedding invitations, Rachel's ultrasound, and Pheobe's twin sister's sex tape are also on display

Some memorable costumes from the series are on display: Rachel's outfit from the series finale, Ross' leather trousers (talcum powder and lotion free) and Monica's see-through red blouse are among them.

The guitar Phoebe, played by Lisa Kudrow, used to perform her regular gig in Central Perk is also there for fans to see - and if they're lucky enough, they might catch one of the weekly performances of her beloved song Smelly Cat.

Baristas in the pop-up handing out free cups of coffee wear T-shirts bearing the catchphrase, 'How YOU brewin'?' -  a play on Joey's famous pick-up line 'How YOU doin'?'

Hangout: Central Perk featured in almost every episode of Friends, with the characters spending hours on end sitting around talking and drinking coffee 

There is a gift shop selling Friends merchandise including DVDs, T-shirts and coffee mugs. 

The pop-up coffee shop will be open Monday - Friday 8 am–8 pm, and Saturday - Sunday, 10 am - 8 pm until October 18.

The stunt is being staged by Warner Bros. and is being advertised as is billed as 'The One with the Free Coffee' - a play on the show's episode titles, which all began with 'The One...'

Friends, which revolved around a group of six twenty-somethings living in Manhattan, finally ended its ten-season run in 2004.

Despite the show's New York City setting, Friends was actually filmed in Burbank, California.

It was in 2009 that a replica of the Central Perk coffee shop opened in London for two weeks to mark the 15th anniversary of the show's start. It welcomed around 900 visitors a day.

Another 'Central Perk' tribute cafe opened in a Beijing shopping centre this week.

Where's Rachel? With the six stars no shows, fans were happy to pose with James Michael Tyler
