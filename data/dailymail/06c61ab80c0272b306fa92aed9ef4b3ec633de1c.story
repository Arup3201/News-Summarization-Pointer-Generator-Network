This athletic bear appears to be doing an impression of an Olympic shot putter, flexing his muscles as he throws rocks from a pond.

The adult grizzly - named Coola - impressed conservationists with his Herculean efforts by hurling the debris several yards.

Photographer Devin Manky captured the playful activity at Grouse Mountain Refuge for Endangered Wildlife, in North Vancouver, Canada.

Devin, who manages the wildlife at the refuge and lives in a cabin nearby, said: 'Coola is such an awesome guy and such an easy going bear.'

The grizzly was taken in by the refuge as an orphaned cub after he was found beside his mum's body by a roadside.

She was killed by a truck.

He is now one of two male grizzly bears that live in the large five acre natural mountainside habitat, which includes three ponds.

Getting ready: The athletic bear clutches the weighty rock in its paws as it readiest itself for a throw

Coola is thought to weigh over 1,000lbs (71 stone), and is allowed to forage naturally on berry bushes and old ant-filled bogs.

However, his diet is supplemented with carrots, potatoes, lettuce and fish.

Devin said: 'Some conservation officers captured him and brought him to a local veterinarians office.

'At the time there was no rehabilitation and release of orphaned Grizzly Bear cubs going on in British Columbia and there was also no room in any zoo.

'It meant Coola might have been euthanized.

'However, our wildlife refuge offered to take him in and introduce him to Grinder, our other bear who was found the same year.

'I started working with Grinder and Coola in 2003 and still do to this day.

'Coola now weighs over a thousand pounds but is still a very curious and playful bear.

'He
 loves stashing little 'toys', such as sticks, stones, and chunks of 
grass at the bottom of his pond and will occasionally pull them out and 
start throwing them around for fun.

Cooling off: After spending some time showing off its power and strength, this bear relaxes in the cooling waters of Grouse Mountain Refuge for Endangered Wildlife, in North Vancouver, Canada

'He can do that for a long time.

'He once threw a chunk of grass up in the air and it landed on his head like a toupe!'

He added: 'Grinder and Coola know me well but we don't go in and have free contact with them because they are just so large.

'Even if they were just being friendly or playful we could be in trouble.

'Therefore these photos were taken from outside a fence.'
