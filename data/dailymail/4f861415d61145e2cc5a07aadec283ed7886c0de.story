It may look like a toy car for a small child but this miniature automobile - complete with an engine, accelerator and brakes - is one man's  solution to avoiding Shanghai's gridlock.

Chinese inventor  Xu Zhiyun, 60, is the brains behind the quirky car which took him two years to build at a cost of just £155.

Xu regularly drives it around the busy Shanghai streets, weaving in and out of traffic.

It may only be the size of a small toy car but this miniature automobile can quickly navigate Shanghai traffic

It measures just 23 inches in length, 13 inches in width and 15 inches in height, making it one of the world's smallest cars.

Despite its diminutive size, the car has an engine, accelerator, brakes, front and rear lights, a horn and gears.

It also has enough room for a sound system teed up with 500 songs.

Xu has enjoyed building things since he was a child and has been interested in motorcycles for 30 years

Xu said: 'I liked building things since childhood. I've been interested in motorcycles for more than 30 years and at last I wanted to assemble the smallest car. It's only a hobby.'

Xu has also used his handiwork to make life easier at home.

He has invented a steering device to move his television and makes his own clothes.
