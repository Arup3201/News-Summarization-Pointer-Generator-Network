Killer Jon Venables has blamed the mother of James Bulger for the toddler's murder saying that she should never have left him on his own, according to reports. 

Venables and Robert Thompson were both 10-years-old when they shocked Britain by abducting Bulger, then just 2-years-old, before torturing and killing him. The crime made the boys the youngest killers in modern English history.

The duo snatched Bulger from outside a butcher's shop in Bootle, Merseyside, in 1993, while his mother popped into a store for just a few seconds. The toddler's mutilated body was found on a railway line in Walton, Liverpool, two days later.

Killer Jon Venables, seen above age 10 after being arrested for the murder of James Bulger, has blamed the toddler's mother for her son's death saying that she should never have left him on his own

A surveillance camera image shows Venables leading Bulger out of the Bootle Strand shopping mall, near Liverpool, on February 12, 1993; the 2-year-old's mutilated body was found on railway lines two days later

Venables, now 32, is said to have told a reveller in a packed pub that Bulger's mother Denise Fergus was responsible for her son's death, an action that could have put his £1 million secret identify at risk.

The killer's identity is protected by a lifelong order and has been changed four times since his release in 2001, costing taxpayers £250,000 each time.

The reveller has told how he spoke to Venables in the 'gay friendly' pub after taking pity on the killer who was getting drunk alone at the bar. He said Venables had been hitting on his 56-year-old mother. 

Bulger's mother Denise Fergus is outraged by Venables claim saying 'how dare he try and put the onus back on me'

The man, who has not been named, described Venables as a 'very troubled person' who appeared to want to reach out to someone.

The man said: 'It was like he wanted me to know who he was and couldn't help himself. He told me he wasn't allowed a mobile or to go on social networking sites,' he told the Daily Mirror.

'Then something clicked. I was saying to my mum, 'I'm sure that's Jon Venables'. I said to him, 'You're Jon Venables'. And he denied it.

The pair began talking about Bulger and the man said Venables claimed the death was 'the mum's fault for leaving him outside the butcher's'.

Ms Fergus, 47, told the newspaper: 'How dare he try to put the onus back on to me? I was in a shop for 30 seconds and had briefly turned around. It's all on CCTV footage.

'He's already admitted that he and Thompson were to blame.'

The man later searched for a picture of Venables online and claims he is 100 per cent sure it was the killer he had spoken to. 

Venables and Thompson were found guilty of killing Bulger in November 1993 and were sentenced to custody until they reached 18.

They were freed in 2001, but by 2010 Venables was back in prison for violating the terms of his release by possessing child pornography.

Venables was paroled again in 2013 and took on his fourth new identity.
