Thousands of people gathered on southern New Hampshire roadsides on Saturday to honor a marine who was killed in Afghanistan earlier this month, as his body was brought back to his hometown for burial.

Lance Corporal Brandon Garabrant made headlines last year when he was barred from wearing his uniform for his high school graduation last June.

The 19-year-old soldier was killed by a roadside bomb on June 20, along with two other service members.

Procession: Garabrant's final ride home began at Manchester-Boston Regional Airport on Saturday

Support: Thousands of people lined the roadsides along the procession's path to honor the fallen soldier

The procession carrying the soldiers remains began at Manchester-Boston Regional Airport early in the morning and proceeded to a funeral in Peterborough, his home town.

According to the Boston Globe, the caravan of supporters included family, fellow Marines, State Police, at least 100 motorcyclists, and 
firefighters from Peterborough, Temple, Mason, and Brookline, said 
George Clark, chief of the Temple Volunteer Fire Department, where 
Garabrant volunteered.

'It was totally unbelievable, the amount of people that were on the side of the road honoring him,' Clark, a family friend, told the paper. 'When we turned onto 101 in Milford, there was one Marine standing there by himself . . . and it was just like, wow, it really hit you.'

Clark said about 100 people were seen gathered near on intersection along, where a fire truck hoisted a large U.S. flag over the roadway where the procession would pass.

'Nobody deserves it, but I think it hits home even harder at that age,' he said. 'Being so young and he just graduated high school last year, and had such an unbelievable life ahead of him and the things he could have accomplished.'

Garabrant signed up for the armed forces immediately after finishing high school. He was so proud of making it 
into the Marines that he made headlines last year that he tried to wear 
his uniform to his high school graduation.

Support: Garabrant's family and friends appreciate the support their receiving from the community

His Peterborough school denied his request, telling the teenager that he would have to wear his cap and gown over the newly acquired uniform.

The principal, Brian Pickering, this week praised his former student and said the school community was upset to hear that Garabrant had died.

'We are all shocked and deeply saddened by his passing and we are incredibly grateful for his service to our country,' Pickering told WMUR9.

Garabrant's untimely death struck a chord with many in his New Hampshire community. Several had already backed the young man's dedication to the forces after his plea to graduate in his uniform.

Hero: As well as serving in the Marines, Garabrant worked as a volunteer firefighter

At the time of the high school celebration last June, he had just completed his training at a South Carolina camp.

Several shops around the school showed their support for his request to wear the uniform, and put signs up calling for the school to change its rules.

His mother, Jesse Garabrant, said at the time: 'I'm overwhelmed with the support of the community. 
It's just wonderful.'

As well as being a dedicated Marine, Garabrant also worked as a volunteer firefighter in Temple.

'Whenever he came home on leave, the 
first thing he did, contacting me, "Chief, I need a pager so I can help 
you out",' volunteer fire chief George Clark said.

'He absolutely loved what he was doing. He knew the sacrifice and he was still willing to do it,' Clark told WMRU9.

Peterborough police chief Scott Guinard also praised the young Marine, calling him 'a young gentleman'.

Garabrant had been assigned to a NATO security force in Afghanistan, and appeared to be enjoying life on deployment.

When he arrived at his post in April, he wrote on Facebook: 'Loving life in Afghanistan so far. Gym twice a day, hanging out with a great group of friends.'

He had also made light of the extreme weather conditions he and the fellow Marines were working in, as he posted a picture of the forecast this week, showing it reaching 113F.

New Hampshire governor Maggie Hassan has paid tribute to the Marine and volunteer firefighter who was 'dedicated to serving his fellow citizens, and he was tragically taken from us far too soon'.

Senator Jeanne Shaheen added: 'Garabrant was a hero in every sense of the word. He valiantly served our country and epitomized the bravery and sacrifice of every member of our armed forces for which we will be forever grateful.'
