Chelsea had mixed success in their latest pre season outing - a Istanbul pre season tournament in memory of the Soma mining disaster - beating Fenerbahce but losing late on to Besiktas in two 45-minute matches.

Diego Costa started both games and the £32million hitman scored a brilliant goal against Fenerbahce, beating four defenders to open the scoring before Branislav Ivanovic added a second.

A defeat to Besiktas through Ersan Gulum's late goal denied them the title though as Besiktas came out on top.

World Cup returners Andre Schurrle, Oscar, Willian and Ramires all made their first appearances of pre season as Jose Mourinho's side went back to winning ways after a 3-0 defeat at Werder Bremen.

MATCH REPORT - BESIKTAS 1-0 CHELSEA

Ersan Gulum scored a late win to deny Chelsea the title in their pre season mini-tournament at the Sukru Saracoglu stadium.

Former Chelsea striker Demba Ba was denied by Petr Cech before Gulum netted from the subsequent corner to condemn Chelsea to defeat.

Didier Drogba came closest for the Blues, seeing a decent free kick effort knocked away by Cenk Gonen in the Besiktas goal.

Competitive: John Terry

Besiktas: Gonen, Franco, Sivok, Nukan, Kurtulus, Koybasi, Boral, Hutchinson, Ozyakup, Holosko, Tosun.

Goal: Gulum 43. 

Chelsea: Cech, Ivanovic, Cahill, Terry, Luis, Matic (Mikel 44), Fabregas (Salah 36), Ramires (Torres 44), Hazard (Oscar 23), Willian, Costa (Drogba 23).

Cech will have been disappointed for his part in the decisive goal - getting caught in no-mans land and being blocked off at the corner - allowing Gulum to stick the ball into the empty net.

Before that former Blue Ba got away from Branislav Ivanovic and Gary Cahill before Cech tipped his shot wide.

In a game of few chances Diego Costa saw an early shot saved but Chelsea didn't create enough to merit the win leaving captain Terry to make the trophy presentation to their victorious Turkish opponents.

Reasons to be cheerful: Jose Mourinho seemed in a better mood than after Chelsea's 3-0 defeat in Bremen

MATCH REPORT - FENERBAHCE 0-2 CHELSEA

Diego Costa scored a brilliant goal to set Chelsea on their way to a win over Fenerbahce in a 45-minute Istanbul friendly as the Blues' £32million hitman continued his fine pre season form.

Branislav Ivanovic doubled the lead with a follow-up to Andre Schurrle's free kick as Jose Mourinho's side took an early lead in the pre season tournament arranged to help the families of victims in the Soma mining disaster.

And Petr Cech took a step ahead of Thibaut Courtois in the battle to be Chelsea's No 1, making a smart save and keeping a clean sheet - albeit for just a half - as his young Belgian rival missed out through injury.

Fenerbahce: Demirel, Topal, Sow, Meireles, Sahin, Alves, Kadlec, Potuk, Emenike, Gonul, Erkin.

Chelsea: Cech, Ivanovic, Cahill, Terry, Azpilicueta, Fabregas (Mikel 39), Matic, Schurrle (Ramires 33), Oscar, Hazard (Salah 41), Costa (Drogba 35).

Goals: Costa 24, Ivanovic 31.

Schurrle, Oscar and Ramires all made their first appearances of pre season but Costa played the starring role as he warmed up to spearhead the Blues' Premier League title bid.

Moving from a position on the left wing the Spanish centre forward turned one defender before escaped the attentions of three more before smartly finishing past Volkan Demirel after 24 minutes.

And Ivanovic made it 2-0 later in the half, latching on to Demirel's parry from Schurrle's dead ball attempt.

Oscar earlier had a goal wrongly ruled out for offside after latching onto Eden Hazard's through ball while Costa was lucky to avoid injury when Bruno Alves jumped in for a two-footed challenge but was only booked.

Courtois was missing from the Blues squad after picking up a minor injury problem.
