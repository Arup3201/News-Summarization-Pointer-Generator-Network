Luis Suarez admits he had never even dreamed of playing in an El Clasico match before he sealed a move to Barcelona.

But now, the 28-year-old, who arrived in Spain following a £75million move from Liverpool, is preparing for his first El Clasico at the Nou Camp.

It's a game that could shape the La Liga title race this season and Suarez, who made his Barcelona debut against Real Madrid earlier in the season, is nothing but excited.

Suarez revealed in an interview with Barca TV: 'I never imagined playing in El Clasico. I used to watch the games and look at photos and I used to say how incredible to play in it was.

'Now it's time to enjoy it and make the most of the moment. I was at the 5-0 game and the 1-1 draw in the Champions League (2010/2011). As a fan you enjoy it a lot.'

Speaking about making his debut in Spanish football's biggest game, Suarez said: 'I was focused on my nervousness about coming back to play.

'Aside from it being El Clasico, it was important for me. I didn't enjoy it as you should enjoy El Clasico, let's hope I can do it this time.'

Suarez has become an important part of a three-pronged attack at Barcelona since his arrival and has played some of the best form of his career.

However, the Uruguayan striker remains self-critical and is only concentrating on being happy on the pitch and helping the squad.

Suarez said: 'I don't know if this is my best moment of form. I do know that I am happy, I feel like I am helping the team and that allows me to be relaxed.

'It isn't difficult to have an understanding with players of Barcelona's quality.

'But we have to continue in that vein, showing that we want to help the team and that nobody wants to steal the limelight, only to achieve big things.'
