At least 20 Australians believed to have fought with Islamic State terrorists in Syria have been able to return to Australia without legal penalty because they left before the government sought to ban the practice, it has been reported.

The government's strengthened counter terrorism laws ban Australians travelling to designated regions where militant groups operate, but they do not give authorities the power to act against people who travelled before the legislation was passed, the Daily Telegraph reports.

The report said more than 20 Australians are believed to have returned to Australia after fighting in Syria, and that they were being monitored by security agencies.  

A legal loophole in the national counter terrorism laws could mean Australian’s involved with the Islamic State overseas are allowed back into the country without consequence

The report comes after revelations that a number of IS fighters who have returned from overseas conflicts are living in Queensland. 

A senior Police Commissioner has warned that the experience these fighters have gained from the conflict in makes them a major concern for Australian authorities, reports Courier Mail.

When asked about the number of extremists living in Australia, Queensland Police Commissioner Ian Stewart said 'I can't confirm the number because it can change in a heartbeat – and the risk can change in a heartbeat. Today it (the number) might be five. Tomorrow it might be 10,'.

'Obviously you don't go off fighting in foreign lands – not as a member of the Australian Defence Force – and come back and think you are not going to be on our radar,' Mr Stewart said.

It comes after after revelations that Islamic State fighters who have returned from the conflict in Iraq and Syria are living in Queensland, but are being 'closely monitored' by officials

Queensland Police Commissioner Ian Stewart would not confirm the number of extremists living in Australia

'And that's because of the experiences that they have, and the skill set that they pick up by being involved in fighting elsewhere.' 

It is believed that 12 Queenslanders are among the 70 identified Australians fighting in Iraq and Syria.

Some of them are hiding in Syria, fearing if they come back to Australia they will be prosecuted by severe new anti-terror laws that could see them jailed for up to 25 years. 

In December, Foreign Minister Julie Bishop announced the government's first 'no-go zone' in Syria under the Foreign Fighters Bill, where Australian's could face 10 years in jail for travelling to without good reason 

In December, Foreign Minister Julie Bishop announced the government's first 'no-go zone' under the Foreign Fighters Bill, the province of Al-Raqqa (Ar-Raqqa) in Syria, some 160 kilometres east of Aleppo.

She told parliament that she was looking at declaring more parts of the region, where Islamic State is active, as terror zones and said any Australians currently in the Al-Raqqa province without legitimate purpose should leave immediately.

Under the legislation, any Australian found to have travelled to a declared region without good reason can face up to 10 years jail for the offence. Only those who provide proof on humanitarian or family grounds will be granted permission.
