Right behind you: Boris Johnson with his adviser Guto Harri in 2009

Guto Harri, Boris Johnson’s ex- spin doctor, has accepted a lucrative job at News International.

The former BBC journalist – who worked closely with the Tory London Mayor and helped mastermind his re-election – starts work today as communications director at Rupert Murdoch’s media company.

Mr Harri’s appointment will raise questions about continuing close links between the company and the Conservative Party, which are under intense scrutiny at the Leveson Inquiry into Press standards.

Earlier this month it emerged that David Cameron nearly hired Mr Harri to be his spin doctor ahead of his eventual appointment of former News of the World editor Andy Coulson.

Mr Coulson told the inquiry that Mr Cameron had held talks with Mr Harri but was persuaded by George Osborne to hire him instead.

Mr Harri, the BBC’s former chief political correspondent, went on to become Mr Johnson’s spin doctor when he first won office in 2008 and worked with the mayor until his re-election for a second term earlier this month.

It is understood that the Prime Minister made a second attempt to woo Mr Harri after he let it be known that he would be stepping down as Mr Johnson’s director of external affairs.

Commenting on Mr Harri’s new job, Labour MP Chris Bryant said: ‘It feels a bit like the revolving door of the Conservative Party, the Metropolitan Police and News International continues to revolve.’

Labour’s media spokesman, Helen Goodman, said: ‘It seems that the lure of Murdoch or his money is irresistible to some people in the political world – but this is a mistake, especially after Boris called for the head of the BBC to be a Tory.

‘Of course newspapers have values but to be able to hold politicians to account they need a degree of independence from political parties, which Mr Harri is signally failing to demonstrate.’

Mr Harri, 45, who is reported to be on a salary of £250,000 a year, will be responsible for restoring News International’s battered image in the wake of the phone hacking scandal.

But, after four years at Mr Johnson’s side, he will have an intimate knowledge of the thinking of a politician still tipped to succeed Mr Cameron as Tory leader. Mr Harri replaces Andrew Honnor who held the position in an interim capacity and has recently set up his own agency.

Mr Johnson, meanwhile, has been criticised for initially dismissing the hacking scandal as party political ‘codswallop’ in September 2010.

Documents subsequently revealed that NI was at the time offering him £2million towards an academy school in London and talking of donating millions more to sponsor another Johnson project, a cable car crossing the Thames.

Pressure: Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt, right, seen walking with former adviser Adam Smith, left, will appear before the Leveson Inquiry this week

In 2010, according to emails already published by Leveson, News International executive Will Lewis asked colleagues: ‘Where are we with the schools project, particularly Boris securing the land and [Education Secretary] Michael Gove the capital investment?’

Both offers were, however, dropped shortly afterwards.

Beleaguered Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt faces more pressure this week when the men at the centre of the row over his handling of the Murdoch bid for BSkyB give evidence to the Leveson Inquiry.

His former special adviser, Adam Smith, and News Corporation’s chief lobbyist, Frederic Michel, will appear on Thursday, leading to fresh scrutiny of the minister’s role in the £8billion bid by the company to take full control of the broadcaster.

Mr Smith quit last month after a damning 163-page dossier of emails between the minister’s office and the Murdoch empire was published during James Murdoch’s testimony to the inquiry.

Mr Smith admitted he went ‘too far’ in handing sensitive information to Mr Michel, but said he acted ‘without authorisation’ from the minister. Mr Hunt insists he acted with propriety and did not know what Mr Smith was doing.

News International chief executive Tom Mockridge said: ‘Guto’s experience as a communications professional, along with his solid journalistic background, means he is well qualified to lead us through the challenges we face as NI continues to change and progress.’

Mr Harri said: ‘With a proud heritage and firm commitment to serious journalism, I relish the chance to play my part in helping the new leadership secure a strong future.’

Last week, the company’s former chief executive, Rebekah Brooks, 43, was charged with conspiracy to pervert the course of justice along with her husband Charlie and four others. She protests her innocence.
