Javier Hernandez took the opportunity to have his picture taken with former Manchester United striker Ruud van Nistelrooy when Mexico played Holland on Wednesday.

The Mexico forward, who is currently on loan at Real Madrid after being deemed surplus to requirements by United boss Louis van Gaal this season, posted the snap on Twitter on Saturday.

Former Holland international Van Nistelrooy spent five seasons at Old Trafford where he became one of Europe's most prolific strikers, scoring 95 Premier League goals in 150 games, before departing the club under a cloud after falling out with Alex Ferguson.

Hernandez shared the photo with his four million Twitter followers with the caption 'Thanks Amsterdam for a good experience! Here a pic with the legend @RvN1776'.

The 26-year-old has scored three times in La Liga, but has only started one game since making the switch to the Spanish capital.

Mexico inflicted a fourth defeat in five games on Holland since they beat Brazil 3-0 in the World Cup third place play-off, as pressure mounts on boss Guus Hiddink.

Hernandez scored the third goal in a 3-2 win for Miguel Herrera's side in Amsterdam as former Arsenal striker Carlos Vela bagged a brace either side of half time for the visitors.
