A Texas man was sentenced to more than six years in prison for beating his pet pit bull named Candy with a shovel and drowning her in a pool as punishment for attacking him and ruining his furniture.

Robert Prichard, 60, of Mesquite, was convicted Wednesday of a felony animal cruelty charge in connection to his dog's brutal killing in 2013.

During his trial, Prichard claimed he struck Candy after she threatened him and his 8-year-old twin boys.

Brutal end: The pet owner tossed the dog in his backyard pool and then used a net to drown her 

‘I just hit it, hit it, hit it and held it,’ he said from the witness stand, according to Dallas Morning News. ‘And I thought it was unconscious.’

The former dog owner also insisted that he tossed the animal in the pool just to ‘cool her off.’

Prichard testified that he had tried to surrender Candy to animal control in Balch Springs a week before the killing, but the dog was rejected because the 60-year-old lived in a different city.

The Mesquite man described Candy in court as 'too dangerous' and 'destructive' for him and his family.

Mr Prichard has been raising his sons alone since 2010, when his second wife passed away, the Dallas Morning News' Crime Blog reported. 

On Friday, a jury panel sentenced Prichard to six and a half years behind bars.

Before learning his fate, the 60-year-old man asked for leniency and appealed to the jurors to give him probation.

Rejected: Prichard testified that a week before the dog killing, he had tried to surrender Candy to animal control in Balch Springs, but they would not take her because he lived in Mesquite 

‘I beg your mercy,’ he pleaded. ‘I’ve been in jail. I miss my children. I can’t go back and change anything, I can only go from here forward.’

According to prosecutors, on August 30, 2013, Richard Prichard grabbed a shovel and struck Candy the pit bull multiple times in the head for biting him.

He then grabbed the dog and threw her into his backyard pool. As the animal scrambled to get out of the water, Prichard used a pool net to drown her.

The frightened animal's struggle was captured on surveillance video, which was shown to the jury during the trial.

When questioned by police. Prichard admitted that he was angry at the pit bull for chewing on his lawn furniture.

Court documents stated that Prichard answered the door to police covered in blood.

‘I couldn’t get it off my hands. I couldn’t give it away. I had to kill it,’ he said during the trial.

Family man: Prichard told the jury he was afraid for the safety of his 8-year-old twins, whom he has been raising alone since 2010 when he lost his wife (pictured) 

After bonding out of jail in September 2013, Mr Prichard shared a photo on his Facebook page showing his ankle bearing what appeared to be Candy's bite marks.

‘Sorry I made wrong decision that I was forced into due to all destruction, risk for my boys, and ASPCA cost,’ he wrote.

The defendant has been behind bars since June for violating the terms of his bond. The 10 months he had spent in jail will be counted towards his sentence.

Prichard’s attorney, Kent Starr, said he plans to appeal the sentence.

Prosecutors originally had asked for a 10-year sentence for Prichard, whom they called a 'ticking time bomb waiting to go off.'
