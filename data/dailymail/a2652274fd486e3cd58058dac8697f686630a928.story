On Sunday, Ashley Barnes scored to rescue a point for Burnley against the might of Manchester City at the Etihad Stadium.

But in March 2013, while playing for Brighton in the Championship, Barnes was far from the hero as he picked up a seven-game ban for tripping a referee.

With the Seagulls losing 1-0 to Bolton in the dying minutes, the midfielder saw red and lashed out at official Nigel Miller, landing himself in hot water with the Football Association.

At the time, he was handed a red card and an automatic four-game ban, as it was his second dismissal of the campaign. 

But later, the FA increased the ban to seven matches, citing his behaviour as constituting 'an offence whereby the standard punishment that would otherwise apply was clearly insufficient'. 

The FA had ruled that the incident displayed 'truly exceptional circumstances' and as such it was referred to an independent three-man commission who could recommend a further ban. 

A year and a half later, Barnes is plying his trade in the top level of English football, and has scored three goals in four Premier League games for a Burnley side battling to stay in the division.

Brighton are in a similar position in the Championship, having not won a game since November 4th.
