More than 90 villagers are feared to have been snatched by Boko Haram Islamist militants from the same area where they seized nearly 300 schoolgirls at gunpoint two months ago.

Nigerian security forces said they were investigating reports of the mass kidnapping as negotiations for the release of the schoolgirls appears to be making little progress despite US, British, French and Israeli specialists being involved.

If confirmed, the latest abduction would fuel public and anger frustration over Abuja's inability to quell Boko Haram's five-year campaign to carve out an Islamist state in the mainly Muslim north.

Attack: Nigerians are calling for action after Boko Haram militants are said to have kidnapped a further 91 people

Attacks: The latest abduction of 60 girls and 31 boys in Kummabza, Borno state, is just minutes from Chibok, where the 200 schoolgirls were kidnapped by Boko Haram on April 15

Nigerian media reported that as many 
as 91 villagers had been abducted, most of them women and young girls, 
in the latest kidnappings from three villages 60 miles from the state 
capital Maiduguri in Borno province.

In
 the original attack, the militants had stormed a secondary school in 
the village of Chibok on April 14, about 93 miles from Maiduguri - the 
cradle of the Islamist insurgency - and packed the teenagers onto trucks
 and disappeared into the border area near Cameroon.

Boko
 Haram, which has killed thousands in bomb and gun attacks, initially 
focused on government and security targets, as well as churches and 
Muslim leaders that rejected its brand of Islam.

But recently it has increasingly targeted civilians, emboldened by global publicity after it kidnapped the school at Chibok.

The
 abduction of the girls triggered worldwide outcry and sparked a ‘Bring 
back our girls’ campaign among celebrities, politicians and on social 
media.

Still held: Though reports claim 50 of the schoolgirls captured in Chibok in April have escaped, the majority are still being held by Boko Haram fighters, who are calling for the release of their detained members

Boko Haram, whose name roughly translates as ‘Western education is sinful’ has killed thousands since 2009.

Amnesty International estimates about 1,500 people have been killed in northeast Nigeria in the first three months of this year.

So
 far, 57 of the schoolgirls have returned to their families after 
escaping or being released by kidnappers on health grounds, leaving 219 
unaccounted for. 

Many are feared to have been taken across the borders into neighbouring Cameroon and Niger.
