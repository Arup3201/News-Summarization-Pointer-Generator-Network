There have been jousts, sieges, Royal audiences and endless State banquets.

But never before in its 900-year history has Windsor Castle thrown open its gates to the million-watt razzmatazz of the world’s most successful fashion mogul.

On Tuesday night, Windsor’s medieval halls and Georgian salons will be crammed with an astonishing gathering of Royalty, rock stars, Hollywood celebrities and wealthy philanthropists, invited to a star-studded party sponsored by American designer Ralph Lauren.

Ready for razzmatazz: Windsor Castle is throwing open its gates to the world's most successful fashion mogul, Ralph Lauren and a host of celebrities

The event, hosted by Prince William, aims to raise awareness of London’s Royal Marsden cancer hospital – one of Princess Diana’s favourite charities.

Guests will include supermodels Kate Moss and Cara Delevingne, Oscar-winning actress Cate Blanchett, Harry Potter heroine Emma Watson and Sherlock star Benedict Cumberbatch.

It is expected that most of them will turn out in Ralph Lauren creations.

Notable by her absence will be the Duchess of Cambridge, who reluctantly turned down an invitation to attend.

She is a fan of Ralph Lauren, and has been seen in his blazers and dresses, but sources say she and William want to keep their charitable projects separate in order to spread their influence as wide as possible.

William became president of the Royal Marsden Hospital in 2007 and is keen to enhance his philanthropic profile.

His backing for Mr Lauren’s connection with the Marsden will be seen as his picking up the baton from his mother – who was also the hospital’s president.

The Duke, who is said to have personally asked the Queen for permission to host the gala dinner, is expected to give a brief welcome and address in which he will thank Mr Lauren for extending his philanthropic work to the Marsden.

Mr Lauren is one of the world’s richest men.

His company is the ‘Official Outfitter’ for the Wimbledon tennis championships and his personal association with William and the Marsden will see him take a further step into the upper reaches of British society.

A source close to Mr Lauren said: ‘This is a big deal for him. To be teaming up with British Royalty puts the brand and the Lauren family on a different footing.’

An official spokesman for Mr Lauren said: ‘It’s a very important night. Mr Lauren has not met the Duke before and he is over the moon about it, and very excited.’

Guests at the party will include actress Cate Blanchett, pictured left at the film premiere of 'Babel' in 2006, and model Kate Moss, pictured right

The spokesman added: ‘He has spent a long time looking for the right cancer-related philanthropic mission. This is an opportunity to develop that work.

‘He had a special relationship with Diana and he is looking forward to meeting William.’

The 74-year-old fashion designer, who is also a global supporter of breast cancer research, rarely leaves America, but will fly to London with his wife Ricky, and their three children, David, Dylan and Andrew.

David is married to Lauren Bush, the grand-daughter of former US President George Bush Snr and niece of George W Bush.

After a three-course  dinner, singer Emeli Sande will serenade guests for the finale of the evening.

Guests have been warned that security will be tight and have been asked to leave mobile phones and cameras at home.
