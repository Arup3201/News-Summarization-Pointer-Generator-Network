A widow has paid for a billboard advertisement to be displayed prominently along the interstate in Houston, Texas, in a bid to help detectives find the people who murdered her husband a year ago.

John Martinez was robbed and shot dead by three men outside his home in Houston, Texas on Oct. 13, 2012.

Tired of waiting for justice for husband and her family, widow Norma Houston hopes the usual step of advertising a reward for information will bring fresh clues.

'I just want justice,' she told KHOU. 'I promised my children that I would bring justice to our family and to my husband.'

She has paid for a billboard to placed along Interstate 45 in the city advertising a $5,000 Crime Stoppers reward for any information leading to the arrest of his killers.

John Martinez's body was discovered by his own son and the year since then has been very difficult, said Norma Martinez.

'He didn’t deserve this, we didn’t deserve this, and my children shouldn’t be without a father right now,' she said.

Widow Norma Martinez says she has taken the unusual step because she wants justice for her children and her dead husband John

Martinez believes her husband’s killers were trying to come in the house, when her husband stopped them.

‘I tell my children, he’s our hero,’ she said. ‘I don’t want them doing this to someone else.’

Detectives believe the same people also killed Criss Knight, 50, who was murdered 28 days after Martinez by the very same gun.
