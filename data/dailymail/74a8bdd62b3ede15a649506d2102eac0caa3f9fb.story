This is the touching yet awkward moment nine pairs of students were asked to kiss on camera - despite having never met before.

The clip shows the 18 pupils greet each other for the first time followed by a few seconds of small talk before they go in for their first embrace and snog.

Despite having a reputation for being promiscuous on student nights, the shy smiles and laughs clearly show these students are not accustomed to kissing strangers - one lady even walks away mid-smooch.

First kiss: This montage shows pictures of 18 Bristol students kissing strangers on camera

The video, produced by the University of Bristol TV station, UBTV, and directed by Gemma Wilson, echos similar footage by Los Angeles-based filmmaker Tatia Pilieva in March in which 20 strangers were asked to lock lips on screen.

However, the way the British students react is somewhat more awkward than their American counterparts.

Station manager Will Pope was on hand to help out with producing and editing the UK clip, but declined to take part.

Will, a third year Classical Studies student, said: 'When Gemma came to me with the idea for the shoot, I really wanted to get involved with the project.

Ready? Despite having a reputation for being promiscuous, the awkward smiles and laughs clearly show these students are not accustomed to kissing strangers

Hands on: This couple seem to be enjoying their first-ever kiss despite initial awkwardness 

How did he find it? This young man's body language suggests he found the whole process uncomfortable

'It was quite a tense atmosphere in the studio - a lot of the participants weren’t at home in front of the camera which may have been a bit daunting.

'I was asked to star in the video but I said no. All the students were volunteers, who knew exactly what they would be asked to do.

'It was great fun, and the footage we got was really heart-warming. Their reactions are so human.'

Reaction: One of the men looks happy about his first kiss with the stranger, who looks downtrodden

The video is a tribute to a similar idea by US filmmaker Tatia Pilieva who filmed 20 models meeting and kissing for the first time.

But the Bristol students steal the show with their sheer awkwardness, firmly putting to bed the rumour that students are well-versed in kissing strangers.

One girl even walks off mid-way through the kiss, while most of the pairs ended up just smiling and laughing about the whole ordeal. 

Preparing: A spokesperson for student newspaper The Tab said: 'Nobody knows where to put their hands at any point' but this couple seem to, right

Something funny? The couple seem to find their first kiss hilarious

Awkward? The female student still seems hesitant mid-kiss, while the man just can't let go

Another girl complimented her new partner, by saying 'not bad' after their first embrace.

A spokesperson for student newspaper The Tab said: 'Nobody knows where to put their hands at any point.

'Some of the people seemed way too keen to get their tongue in there, and from our experience it isn’t actually that shocking to ask a student to make out with a complete stranger, it happens all the time.' 

Before and after: It seems a random smooch wasn't so bad for this pair, whose hands linger after locking lips

Au natural: Some of the couples make the whole experience look easy

Oh no! This chap doesn't look too happy about having to kissed a stranger

Woah! The chap may have got stuck into it but his female counterpart looks somewhat shocked
