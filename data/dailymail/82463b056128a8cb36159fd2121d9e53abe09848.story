A rare collection of Meissen ceramics valued at more than £1million will go under the hammer at top auction house Bonhams, in London, this week.

Among the lots expected to spark a bidding war is an elaborately decorated Hausmalar eagle teapot and cover, made in around 1715 and valued at between £25,000 and £35,000.

Lavishly finished with a gilt eagle spout and gilt ear-shaped handle, the piece depicts four figures beneath a golden tree.

The lid, which attaches to the handle and spout by a chain, is covered with birds perched on branches.

Among the other 80 stunning lots set for auction on Wednesday is a chocolate beaker bearing a coat of arms, which is expected to fetch £25,000 to £30,000.

Originally part of a set of six beakers, it was given as a wedding present to the Princess Maria Amalia of Saxony for her marriage in 1738 to Charles VII, King of Naples.

The young bride was only 14 years old when her marriage was arranged by her father, King Augustus III, successor of Augustus the Strong, who first set up the Meissen porcelain factory near Dresden.

The beaker is one of the few surviving pieces from the wedding present, which originally comprised six teabowls and saucers and six chocolate beakers.

Collectors will also be able to bid for a very rare early Meissen part tea and coffee service valued at up to £100,000, and a chamberpot, known as a bourdalou, which is expected to fetch as much as £60,000.

Production of porcelain at Meissen near Dresden started in 1710.

It was the dominant style of European porcelain among royals and nobility until around 1756.

The Meissen collection being sold by Mr Marouf and his wife Roswitha is one of the world’s biggest and most highly regarded.

Sebastian Kuhn, Bonhams’ director of European porcelain, said: 'The Said and Roswitha Marouf Collection is without doubt one of the most important collections of 18th century Meissen porcelain to come to the market.

'It is incredible to see such a selection of fine pieces, including some rare and intimate items from the royal toilette, with fascinating provenance.

'Said Marouf has been an avid collector all his life and started out collecting pocket and wrist watches.

'It is not hard to see why his eye for detail attracted him to the extremely detailed and intricate decoration of early 18th century Meissen porcelain'.
