Gus Poyet has urged Connor Wickham to determine his own future amid talk of him signing a pre-contract agreement with a foreign club in January.

The Sunderland boss has taken a swipe at those advising the 21-year-old and has even warned that they won’t be forgotten when it comes to future deals with other players.

Wickham is out of contract in the summer and is free to discuss terms with foreign clubs from the New Year. A move abroad, however, would significantly reduce the compensation received by the Black Cats.

And Poyet said: ‘Sometimes people don’t want to agree. They want to play a certain way. They want to tell you we will take him to Europe so the club has to pay us less compensation.

‘Fair enough, we know who we are dealing with. You know who you are dealing with for the rest of your life, not just one deal. It’s not a problem, everyone has a reputation.

‘Here we are talking about players, agents, family. Last time I was talking about Connor, the father was quick to reply. Now we’ll see who is going to make the decision about staying at the football club or going to play abroad.

‘My advice is to make the decision yourself. If he makes the decision I will respect it, good or bad.’

Wickham is not agitating for a move but has been played out of his preferred central position

Sportsmail understands that Wickham is not agitating for a move away from the Stadium of Light and remains in discussions over a new deal with sporting director Lee Congerton and chief executive Margaret Byrne.

However, the £8million striker – signed by Steve Bruce in 2011 – has been used in a wide-left position of late rather than his preferred central role, from where he scored four goals to help keep Sunderland in the Premier League during the closing weeks of last season.
