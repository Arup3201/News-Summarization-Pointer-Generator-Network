Jaguar Land Rover smashed its annual sales records during 2013 as global demand soared.

Britain’s biggest car-maker said it had sold 425,006 vehicles – a  19 per cent increase on 2012 – and had set sales records in 38 international markets.

The announcement came as Britain is poised to overtake ailing France in the European car production league table. Strong and rising sales of British-built cars, both at home and abroad, will see France slip from third place – behind Germany and Spain – to be replaced by Britain.

Racing ahead: Jaguar Land Rover smashed annual sales records during 2013. Much of its success is down to the Jaguar F-Type

Yesterday, Jaguar Land Rover claimed 
it was the fastest-growing car brand in Germany, India and the US, with 
other strong markets including Russia, Brazil, Korea and Canada. At 
home, Jaguar sales rose 15 per cent in 2013, with Land Rover up 13 per 
cent.

Dr Ralf Speth, chief 
executive of Jaguar Land Rover, said: ‘2013 has proven to be a very 
positive year, thanks to strong demand for vehicles across the range.

‘Our
 unrelenting focus on design, technology, innovation and quality has 
seen us reach  global consumers in more markets than ever before.’

Independent
 industry analyst Howard Wheeldon said: ‘The brand success of Jaguar 
Land Rover over the past three years has been as phenomenal as it has 
been well deserved. With a workforce that is clearly hugely supportive 
and right behind what management is attempting to achieve, there is no 
reason why in five years’ time this fine company will not be announcing 
that it sold over one million cars.’

Britain’s
 car industry has remained a rare bright spot during the economic 
downturn, with exports holding up well as customers in emerging markets 
continued to snap them up.

With
 the economy on the mend, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders
 recently said car sales were at their highest since  the credit crisis 
of 2007 thanks  to the nascent recovery, cheap financing deals and 
buyers using refunds from mis-sold payment protection insurance.

Last
 week, Jaguar Land Rover launched a recruitment drive to hire workers 
for a new engine manufacturing centre, which will create 600 new roles 
in the next four years at its site near Wolverhampton. About £500million
 is being invested in the facility.

The firm also has design and manufacturing plants in Merseyside and Warwickshire, while its head office is in Coventry.

Unite assistant general secretary Tony Burke said: ‘Jaguar Land Rover is a remarkable manufacturing success story.

‘The
 company faced serious problems prior to 2008 but our members in Unite 
and the company worked together to turn JLR’s fortunes around.

‘JLR
 continues to take on staff, including 600 new staff at their new engine
 plant in the West Midlands. The company also remains committed to 
taking on apprentices as well.

‘The
 manufacturer’s fantastic performance is testament to the workforce. 
Unite union representatives are working with employers such as JLR for 
quality skilled jobs in UK manufacturing.’

Prime
 Minister David Cameron wrote on Twitter: ‘Great news for Britain and 
for jobs as Jaguar Land Rover announce they sold 425,000 vehicles last 
year - 19pc more than in 2012 #LongTermPlan’.
