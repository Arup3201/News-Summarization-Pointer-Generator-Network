Funny face: The photo that has sparked a controversy. It is believed Hollande was trying to make schoolchildren laugh

This unflattering picture of Francois Hollande sparked a censorship row yesterday.

It shows the French President with a gormless-looking grin at a school to coincide with the start of the new term.

The image was released by a photo agency. And when the agency tried to withdraw it from circulation, the photo quickly hit social media sites like Twitter and went worldwide.

The photo shows Hollande grinning in front of a blackboard on which is written: 'Today, it’s back to school.'

The photograph was taken on Tuesday during Mr Hollande’s visit to a school in Denain, northern France, to coincide with the start of term for hundreds of thousands of French pupils. It appears he was pulling a funny face to make the pupils laugh.

The original image came with the caption: 'During a visit to the school Denain Michelet, September 3, 2013, Francois Hollande smiles, chairing a panel discussion on the reform of school timetables established by the government.'

AFP initially posted the picture on its website as available for downloading but – apparently concerned it was inappropriate for a head of state – both later issued a 'mandatory kill' notice, meaning the photo must not be used.

AFP wrote: 'Due to an editorial decision this photo has been withdrawn. Please remove from all your systems. We are sorry for any inconvenience and thank you for your cooperation.'

Despite the ban, however, the image quickly hit social media sites like Twitter, and sparked a flurry of comments.

One wrote: 'Here is the new official photo of François Hollande. Please put up in all town halls!'

Another wrote that no amount of Photoshop editing software 'can make the president look more intelligent'.

Photo kill: AFP released this image to withdraw the gurning picture of Hollande 'due to an editorial issue'

A
third, in a slightly subtler dig at plans to raise the state pension 
age, suggested Mr Hollande was thinking: 'How can I tell them they’re 
going to have to retire at 80?'

Once renowned as being one of 
France’s funniest politicians with a knack for the bon mot, Mr Hollande 
has toned down his humour since becoming president, to accord more 
closely with the gravitas of his status as French head of state.

Quizzed
by French media, AFP insisted it had come no pressure from the Elysée 
Palace to withdraw the photo, which continued to be available through 
Reuters on a pooled basis.

Agencies
withdrawing photos of public figures is very rare in France, hence the 
questions over why a state-funded agency like AFP would attempt to 
withdraw the image at a time when Mr Hollande wants to appear solemn 
over Syria and is commemorating the Nazi war atrocity of 
Oradour-sur-Glane.
