Yannick Bolasie is demonstrating his 360-degree flick for a film crew at Crystal Palace’s training ground when coach Ronnie Jepson strides over.

‘We taught him that trick, you know,’ jokes Jepson before slapping the Palace winger on the back and urging him to make the hour-and-a-half commute back to his home in Uxbridge, west London.

‘We’ve got a big game against Stoke and he needs his rest,’ added Jepson, before wandering off with his mug of tea to resume a conversation with assistant manager Keith Millen in the canteen.

Yannick Bolasie hopes to start scoring more goals for Crystal Palace this season

Bolasie, pulled off a memorable tricked last week, which saw him face away from the pitch with Spurs' Christian Eriksen putting him under pressure

The Palace star has the ball under control, using both feet, as Eriksen closes in 

‘People talked about that bit of skill at Tottenham, but did we win?’ Bolasie asks of himself. ‘Did I score a goal? No. Did I create a goal? No.’

Even so, it is difficult to tire of watching Bolasie’s move, trying to figure out how he completed an electrifying three-point turn and flick off his right boot that took him past Christian Eriksen at White Hart Lane.

That was the official unveiling, but the improvisation and the invention was perfected during his years playing on the street near his parents’ home in Willesden, north-west London.

‘We had to pick a team, so I’d be Brazil, my friends would be Argentina or England or whoever, and there would be 40 kids trying to beat the keeper to stay in the World Cup,’ he said.

‘To get through to the next round I had to improvise, to change direction and speed before anyone could anticipate what I was about to do. It’s a difficult move to defend because if you sense I am about to do it, I can double tap in a different direction.

The slightest touch from Bolasie's right boot plays it over Eriksen and leaves him stranded

And he's off, heading for the byline after the perfect execution of his trick

‘When Eriksen came towards me I knew it was the time to try it. Down by the corner flag, no-one expects you to try something like that. People think I don’t know what I’m going to do next, but it’s all up here,’ he says as he places his raspberry protein shake on the table and points to his head.

On current form, Bolasie, 25, is one step ahead of the game. Yet he has come to the Barclays Premier League the long way, via spells in Malta, with Barnet, Dagenham, Plymouth and Bristol City.

He was born in Lyons, France, and moved to Willesden with his parents as a young boy. Football runs in the family.

Dad Gaby, a truck driver, played for the Congo Under 21 team — Yannick will travel to the Africa Cup of Nations next month to represent the national team and could be away for six weeks.

Younger brother Ruddock Yala plays non-League for Maldon and Tiptree, and Yannick went to watch Glenn Yala — another brother — playing for Chalfont St Peter a couple of weeks back.

The 25-year-old DR Congo international has received widespread praise for his impressive performances

‘Everybody I know played, it’s just how it has always been,’ he added.

In many ways Bolasie is an old-fashioned winger, a throwback to the days when Chris Waddle or Ryan Giggs would send a defender off balance with a step-over before skinning their man down the line.

‘When I’m on the ball I want to make something happen and my theory is that if I go into a game and work hard, everything will happen as a result,’ said Bolasie.

‘If you don’t work hard, and the flicks and tricks don’t come off, then it doesn’t go down well with the fans, does it?

‘I’m benefiting as a winger because these days every kid coming through wants to play No 10.’

Back when Bolasie was a couple of years behind his neighbours Kerrea Gilbert (then of Arsenal) and Phil Ifil (Tottenham), he played all over the park.

Neil Warnock will be dealt a blow when both Bolasie and captain Mile Jedinak leave on international duty

Left back for Brent, right back at Hillingdon Borough, central midfield for his county Middlesex and up front for his Sunday side. ‘At 14, when I went for a trial at Rushden & Diamonds I was playing central midfield, but I came to my senses and realised I was a winger.’

There are few finer sights in English football at this moment than Bolasie flying down the wing for Palace, fuelled by the injection of confidence given to him by the previous manager, Tony Pulis, and his new boss Neil Warnock.

‘I was intimidated by Pulis at first, he was scary,’ admits Bolasie as he reflects on Palace’s remarkable ascent from the drop zone last season. ‘You wouldn’t want to get on his wrong side, but he is a very good tactician and a very good man-manager.

‘We also knew of his record of never getting relegated and it played a big part. His tactical awareness lifted the players.

Bolasie admits he was 'intimidated' by former Palace manager Tony Pulis (above)

‘He knew I could attack, but he also improved me defensively.’

Speak to the Palace coaches at the club’s Beckenham training centre and they are full of praise for Bolasie’s determination to improve. The Palace fitness coach Scott Guyett has challenged Bolasie to set a new personal best by running 11,000 metres against Stoke at Selhurst Park on Saturday.

He smiles at the prospect and Palace’s training ground has been a happier place since Warnock, who returned to the club in August, urged Bolasie to enjoy life a bit more.

‘I met Neil last year and he gives me confidence. He is always telling me to smile and there’s no doubt I am playing better this season.

‘As a professional I made it late, I didn’t have trials and I didn’t have a manager teaching me. I just pinched stuff as I went along.’

The 25-year-old tackles Aston Villa defender Jores Okore during his team's 1-0 defeat 

Bolasie has scored two goals in his nine games representing DR Congo

He is bashful about the tattoo he had inked on to his right arm — ‘Hope for the best but expect the worst’ — when he was struggling to get into the first team under Paul Sturrock at Plymouth. ‘I’m never getting another,’ he admits.

His Twitter account is maintained by his agent: ‘I’m not interested in it because there are too many negative people.’

He no longer drinks — just a Coke at the Christmas party on Saturday evening — and works out in the gym most days at the training ground.

On Thursday, during a practice match towards the end of the training session, he finished off a neat move when he was supplied by Wilfried Zaha from the wing.

Bolasie (left), who has been at Palace since 2012, revealed he no longer drinks 

It is an area of Bolasie’s game he accepts he needs to improve if he is to be regarded as one of the best wingers in the top flight.

Since his move to Palace in 2012, Bolasie has scored only four times in nearly 90 appearances.

‘I’ve been unlucky not to score in the past few games. I was panicking a bit about not scoring, but I know it will come.’

Just like his 360-degree trick, it could be just a matter of time before he delivers something special in front of goal.
