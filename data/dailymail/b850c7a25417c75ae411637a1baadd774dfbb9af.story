David Cameron today faced claims he was ‘stuck-up', after boasting he likes shopping in Waitrose because the customers are nicer.

The political battle over the weekly shop erupted after the Prime Minister shared his views on ‘supermarket sociology’.

After claiming there was ‘something about’ Waitrose customers who are more ‘engaged people’, Labour accused Mr Cameron of making a ‘bizarre and empty-headed intervention’ at a time when many families were struggling to make ends meet.

David Cameron set out his 'supermarket sociology' while on a visit to a store run by Waitrose¿s parent company John Lewis in Cheadle, near Manchester

Mr Cameron gave an insight into his weekly shop while on a visit to a store run by Waitrose’s parent company John Lewis in Cheadle, near Manchester.

Waitrose has faced criticism for a new scheme offering free coffee to people with loyalty cards, with some customers complaining it has attracted a different clientele.

Mr Cameron told staff yesterday: ‘I have got a piece of supermarket sociology, which is that there is something about Waitrose customers ... they are the most talkative.

‘I found that if I shop in Waitrose it takes me about twice as long as everyone wants to stop you and have a chat. Whereas in other supermarkets I find I can dart round very quickly and get everything.

‘It is something about your customers, they are very talkative, engaged people.'

Mr Cameron revealed that he shops at Waitrose - regarded as a favourite of the middle classes - whenever possible.

He uses Ocado - another firm catering to the higher end of the market - to deliver goods to Downing Street.

However,
 he said he went to Sainsbury's near his constituency home in Chipping 
Norton, Oxfordshire, ‘because there isn't a Waitrose’.

The Prime Minister said he found customers in Waitrose more talkative when doing his shopping

But Labour said the remarks showed he was out of touch. Shadow Cabinet Office minister Michael Dugher said: ‘Families are on average 1,600 a year worse off since David Cameron became Prime Minister.

‘Most families understandably have to shop around and watch every penny because of the cost-of-living crisis, plus very many people increasingly have to rely on food banks.

‘This is a world away from that of David Cameron. There's nothing wrong enjoying shopping at Waitrose.

'But Cameron seems to be saying that at Waitrose you get a better class of shopper.

‘This is a bizarre and empty-headed intervention from a Prime Minister who increasingly gives the impression of being stuck-up and out of touch.’

Lib Dem Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg also case doubt on the claims. In the last few weeks I’ve shopped in Asda, Sainsbury’s, Waitrose and Tesco’s, so there you go.

'I’ve done the full spread and at the moment - I will do further market research - I haven’t discerned any great difference,' he told LBC radio.

In 2012 Mr Cameron had to give Waitrose a miss when he went shopping in a Morrisons branch in Plymouth

Labour has had its own problems with Waitrose. Last month frontbencher Andy Sawford wrote to every MP complaining that the free coffee deal was having a 'stark effect' on other coffee shops and should be scrapped.

Last year the Prime Minister was ridiculed for admitting he does not know how much a supermarket loaf costs – because he bakes his own using a bread-making machine.

The Prime Minister was asked the price of a ‘value’ range loaf after claiming he is not out of touch with ordinary people over the rising cost of living.

He guessed it was more than £1 – in fact it is 47p – then by way of explanation got himself into a deeper hole by saying he does not eat ‘the value stuff’.

Instead he uses a £100 breadmaker and a brand of Cotswolds artisan flour which costs around £4.40 a bag. In comparison a 1.5kg bag of Tesco’s own brand flour costs only 65p.
