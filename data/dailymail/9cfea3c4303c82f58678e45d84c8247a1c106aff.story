It has been revealed that South Sydney Rabbitohs star Sam Burgess, who played through the NRL grand final at the weekend with a fractured cheekbone had also fractured his eye socket.

Burgess played through most of the clash with the Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs on Sunday evening with the injury, which he sustained during the first tackle of the game.

The 25-year-old, who is now heading to Rubgy Union, is set to undergo surgery on Tuesday afternoon, an operation he delayed so he could continue celebrating South Sydney's first NRL premiership win in 43 years with fans on Monday.

It was revealed the Clive Churchill medallist had a double-fracture in a statement released by the Rabbitohs earlier in the day.

'Scans this morning have confirmed that Rabbitohs lock Sam Burgess requires surgery to repair fractures in his cheekbone and eye socket,' the statement read.

Burgess will have surgery this afternoon to have a plate inserted into his face to repair the damage,' it continued. 

Burgess tweeted from his hospital bed before going into surgery, likening his bruised and battered face to that of a small rodent and thanking fans for their support.

'Just laying in hospital waiting for surgery, I look similar to a hamster at the moment. I wouldn't change anything for the world though', he wrote.

The Rabbitohs star thanked everyone for their well wishes along the way

'Thanks to everyone for your well wishes and congratulations. It's been an amazing journey this year with a fitting end. Wow,' Burgess also posted. 

On Tuesday morning the Englishman told 2KY's Big Sports Breakfast  that the injury was troubling him after the hectic celebrations that greeted the end of Souths' 43-year premiership drought.

'The cheek is pretty sore, the adrenalin has certainly worn off,' Burgess said.

'It is worth it for the feeling we got at the end of the game.

On Monday it seemed Burgess put off surgery to continue celebrating South Sydney's first NRL premiership win in 43 years at Redfern Oval

The Clive Churchill medallist mingled with thousands of Rabbitoh's fans who crammed into and around Redfern Oval on Monday afternoon to celebrate the club's long-awaited grand final win

'This year certainly meant a lot to me being my last at the club. 

'It is a feeling that will be very hard to replicate. I'm just thankful to be a part of it and given the opportunity at the club,' the 25-year-old revealed.

Burgess said he didn't know when he would be able to make his rugby union debut with English club Bath, but his recovery period is expected to take several months.

'It will be a while, but that is the least of my worries right now,' he said.

'Hopefully this face won't be damaged for too long.

'I have to get it fixed and then crack on.'

Thousands of fans turned up to congratulate the Rabbitohs on their first premiership in 43 years

On Monday Burgess arrived at Redfern Oval for an fan day held to thank supporters looking very bruised and battered from the Sunday night clash. 

For Souths legend George Piggins, the man who successfully fought to have the club reinstated after its expulsion from the competition in 2000, Sunday's game was the first he had attended since Russell Crowe and Peter Holmes à Court took over in 2006.

While impressed with Burgess's courage, Piggins pointed to John Sattler who played almost the entire 1970 grand final  with a broken jaw.

'I've never had a broken cheek bone,' Piggins told Daily Mail Australia. 'I've had a broken jaw. And I've got to say I've never had anything more painful in my life.

'With a broken jaw, when you come out of it all your teeth are wired up. It smells like a sewer rat. No risk in the wide world (a broken cheek bone) hurts. But I'll go for the cheek bone.'

Piggins, who attended the grand final only because businessman John Singleton, the TAB and car deal Steven Nasteski donated a total of $120,000 to charity, said he would be happy to attend another game sometime.

About 10,000 people were expected to attend Monday's fan celebrations with the line snaking half way around the block

'I might find myself doing that,' the 69-year-old said. 'If I can go to the football and I can sit where I want to sit and be with who I want to be with.

'I'd be interested to go back to another game but there wouldn't be all the fanfare. There's other things in life.'
