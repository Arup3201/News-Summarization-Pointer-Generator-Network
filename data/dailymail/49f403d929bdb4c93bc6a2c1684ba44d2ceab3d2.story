Sami Hyypia comes up against some familiar foes on Wednesday night when he takes his Brighton side to Tottenham in the Capital One Cup.

Hyypia regularly locked horns with Spurs during his successful 10 years as a centre-half with Liverpool.

The Finn is finding management in England a little tougher, with Brighton languishing one place above the relegation zone following 10 Sky Bet Championship matches without a win.

However, Hyypia has urged his struggling side to play with no fear when they run out at White Hart Lane.

'I don't fear any game. Anything can happen. The score can be anything,' he told the Argus.

'We can go there and win, we can go there and lose. It's very important that we concentrate on how we play there and how we present ourselves.

'We need to have the courage, we don't have to fear them. They have good individuals and they can really hurt you if they are on top of their game but we don't have to fear them."

Winger Kazenga LuaLua is back in the squad after serving a one-match ban over the weekend, but Sam Baldock is cup-tied.

Fellow striker Craig Mackail-Smith could miss out again with a hamstring injury and right-back Bruno is struggling with groin trouble while long-term injury victims Solly March, Dale Stephens and Andrew Crofts are still out.

Hyypia added: 'I am not sure what kind of line-up we will put out. We don't have a lot of options at the moment. We have some injury worries and Sam can't play because he is cup-tied, so we'll see.

'I'd like to have a team that fights for 90 minutes and has the confidence to show what kind of team we are. If we do that then what ever the score is I'm happy.'

The Capital One Cup has provided a welcome distraction from their league struggles but Hyypia insists the club, who reached the play-offs in the last two seasons, can still have a successful campaign.

'I have high targets for this season still and we still have time to reach those targets but something needs to change,' he said.

'We need to toughen up and then hopefully we'll get the results as well.'
