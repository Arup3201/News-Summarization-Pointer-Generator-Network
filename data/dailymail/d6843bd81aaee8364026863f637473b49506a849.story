An enormous tyre fire on a farm in Essex has shut down roads and trains, leading to travel chaos this morning as firefighters battle to control the blaze.

Residents of the area have been warned to stay indoors with their doors and windows shut if they see smoke, with children and asthmatics in particular danger.

The fire started last night at a farm near the Fairglen interchange off the A130, between Wickford and Rayleigh.

Blaze: Firefighters at the scene of a tyre fire which broke out last night between Wickford and Rayleigh in Essex

Inferno: Seven fire crews have used water and foam in an effort to extinguish the enormous fire

Eruption: The fire has proved difficult to control because the tyres are packed tightly together and it is hard to get water to the core

Seven fire engines were sent to tackle the blaze, which has proved particularly tricky because the waste tyres are packed closely together making it difficult to extinguish the core of the fire.

The A1245 has been closed in both directions because of smoke reducing visibility in the area and this is likely to continue for most of the day, Essex Police said.

Greater Anglia train services on the line to London are not running between Southend and Wickford, and are not expected to restart until this afternoon.

Inspector Scott Egerton, of Essex Police's roads policing team, said: 'There will be long delays and I would ask people to avoid the area.

'Diversions will be in place but people should check social media and Essex travel updates for the latest information. The transport network in the area could be affected for most of the day.'

Flames: Local residents were told not to go outside because of the risk of smoke inhalation and other injuries

Tricky: Firefighters ended up using foam to beat back the flames, but it took longer to get to the fire burning at the core

Action: Crews battled through the night to try and extinguish the fire on a farm

Dramatic: Flames leapt up from the fire through the night and into the morning despite the best efforts of fire crews

Gary Jeffrey of Essex Fire and Rescue Service said that crews remain at the scene attempting to put out the fire.

'It is a large pile of tyres which have been tightly bound together at a waste storage site,' he said early this morning. 'Because the tyres are so densely packed and tightly bound it is proving difficult to get water on to much of the fire.'

Firefighters successfully brought the flames under control with foam this morning, but they are still fighting to extinguish it completely.

'The foam attack was successful in knocking the flames back but the fire continues to burn deep within the pile,' Mr Jeffrey said. 'We are now using water to cool the pile and protect surrounding risks.

'We hope to get some heavy plant machinery in to start breaking the pile up later to give us better access to extinguish the fire.'

Disruption: Train services in the area were shut down all morning, causing chaos for commuters travelling to London

At work: Firefighters next to the fire as it continued to burn this morning

Closed: The A1245 was shut in both directions as a result of the danger from smoke pouring into the air

Public Health England said in a statement that local residents should 'avoid outside areas affected by any smoke or ash'.

It added: 'If people can see smoke outside their property, or can see evidence of soot particles on window sills or external surfaces, then they should stay indoors with windows and doors closed until the fire has been brought under control.

'For anyone who already has problems with their lungs, for example asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder, it is advisable to stay inside while the fire is still burning, minimise infiltration of smoke by keeping windows and doors closed and to be sure to keep all necessary medicine with you.'

Residents who are suffering from ill health as a result of the fire should seek medical attention.
