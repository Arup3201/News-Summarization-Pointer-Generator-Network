When was the last time you had sex so good, you didn't stop grinning at each other for days?

OK, how about reasonably good sex that left you with a rather smug post-coital glow?

Hmm. Then how many of you fantasise more about sleeping in your bed than bouncing around on it?

Tracey says that a low libido can effect us all from time to time but there are plenty of ways to get yourself back in the mood

Stressful jobs, fractious relationships, parenting, that monotonous commute - all combine to rob us of desire.

If sex is just another chore rather than something you look forward to, chances are one or more of the following is to blame.

Pinpoint the problem, then keep reading for some practical solutions.

Reasons why you're not frothing at the mouth

Physical

Emotional

Tracey says that even the smallest adjustments such as getting a good night's sleep, can help increase a couple's sex drive

How to get back in the mood:

Get a good night's sleep.

Disturbed sleep leads to a reduction in the male hormone testosterone, which boosts both your libidos.

Take responsibility for your libido.

Don't expect your partner to turn you on, do it yourself! Make it your mission to pinpoint what gets you in the mood for sex then do more of it.

Let your imagination loose.

Don't be ashamed of your fantasies and refuse to feel guilty if having sex with someone other than your partner is one of them. Being unfaithful in reality isn't on but it's OK to do it in your head. Really. One survey found around 75% of us do it to keep sex fresh.

Meet halfway.

If you don't want intercourse, what about oral sex? If you don't want oral sex or any sex yourself, do you mind pleasuring them? At the very least, you can and should be able to offer the physical intimacy of a cuddle.

Tracey says that it's important to approach the subject rather than avoid it

Focus on sex, don't avoid it.

If you're constantly being hassled for it, sex is often the last thing you want to watch or read about. Low libido people often avert their eyes when they see nudity, a sexy scene on telly or in the movies or flip the page if they hit a story in the newspapers or glossies.

Don't. It's just as easy to think yourself into sex than it is to talk yourself out of it and the more often you expose yourself to sexy literature and images, the sexier you'll feel.

Know what you want and need to be satisfied sexually.

And I'm talking both in, and out of, bed. If you need to relax first, don't be scared to ask for a massage. Or for them to do the dishes while you take a bath or shower.

Give sex a high priority in your life.

If you're avoiding it or not interested, chances are it's the last thing you do, last thing at night. Well – Gosh! – funnily enough, even high sex drive people sometimes wonder if it's worth the effort when they're exhausted after a long day at work.

Get into a routine where you and your partner have chat-time then sex before you start dinner and switch the TV on. Or if you really are too stressed during the week, have breakfast in bed on the weekends and make that sex time.

Get your body clocks in sync.

A morning person matched with a night time one? If this is you, take turns on the time of day you make love. And try sex mid morning, midday and mid afternoon, not just morning or night

Sex does NOT equal intercourse.

Plenty of people (women especially) don't orgasm through intercourse alone, so tend to find penetrative sex quite boring. If sex is boring, it's no wonder you're not desperate to dive into bed! The more you mix up what you do, the higher the interest.

Don't relax!

Instead, focus on the erotic sensations you're feeling. Tighten the muscles of your thighs, bottom, lower tummy and pelvic floor muscles to help trigger an orgasmic reflex.

Set up a craving cycle.

Without wanting to point out the obvious, orgasms feel good. If something feels good, our body – quite logically – says 'more please' and sulks if we don't obey by developing either psychological or physical cravings when denied its high.

The more sex you have, the more you want. We quickly forget how great sex can be. Have good sex often and you're constantly reminded of all the physical and emotional pluses.
