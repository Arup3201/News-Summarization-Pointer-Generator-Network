Spherical fossils in China dating back 600 million years could be the remains of the planet's earliest animals.

The fossils are 60 million years older than the date skeletal animals appeared during a huge growth spurt of new life on Earth known as the Cambrian Explosion.

Virginia scientists claim the fossils are too complex to be bacteria, and may instead be the embryos of an ancient unidentified creatures.

Called Megasphaera, the ancient fossils come from a rock layer in southern China called the Doushantuo Formation and contradict several longstanding interpretations of multicellular fossils.

Each fossil measures around 0.03 inches (0.7mm) across and originated from what could have been a marine environment at the time.

'This opens up a new door for us to shine some light on the timing and evolutionary steps that were taken by multicellular organisms that would eventually go on to dominate the Earth in a very visible way,' said Shuhai Xiao, a professor of geobiology in the Virginia Tech College of Science.

The Cambrian explosion, or Cambrian radiation, was the relatively rapid appearance, around 540 million years ago, of most major animal phyla, as demonstrated in the fossil record.

About 580 million years ago, most organisms were simple, composed of individual cells occasionally organized into colonies.

Over the following 70 or 80 million years, the rate of evolution accelerated by an order of magnitude (as defined in terms of the extinction and origination rate of species) and the diversity of life began to resemble that of today.

It ended with the Cambrian-Ordovician extinction event, approximately 488 million years ago.

'Fossils similar to these have been interpreted as bacteria, single-cell eukaryotes, algae, and transitional forms related to modern animals such as sponges, sea anemones, or bilaterally symmetrical animals. This paper lets us put aside some of those interpretations.'

By cutting the rocks into extremely thin slicers, the scientists were able to shine a light through the fossils to see the formation inside, according to a report in LiveScience.

Professor Xiao found patterns in the fossils that suggests cell-to-cell adhesion and programmed cell death - qualities found in the cell of animals and plants.

The fossils could represent the shift between single-celled life and multicellular animals, Professor Xiao said.

Professor Xiao is now hoping to find more Megasphaera, including fossils of the adult creatures that may have created the embryos.

'We will have to be open-minded in terms of what can be expected,' Professor Xiao told Stephanie Pappas at LiveScience. 

'There are extinct animals or even offshoots of the lineages leading to animals that could be rather different from what we know as animals living today.'
