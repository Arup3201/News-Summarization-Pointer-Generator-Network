Six Flags Magic Mountain has updated their classic roller coaster Colossus, making it faster, steeper, taller, and a whole lot scarier.

Twisted Colossus, which is coming in 2015, combines wood and steel to make for the longest and most innovative hybrid coaster in the world.

And while thrill-seekers may still have to wait some time to experience the ride, they can get a look at an amazing new POV video recently released by the theme park.

Twisted Colossus is an updated version of the classic Colossus roller coaster that first opened at Six Flags Magic Mountain in 1978

By combining steel with wood, Magic Mountain has created the longest and most innovative hybrid coaster in the world

The original Colossus, which opened to the public on June 29, 1978, was at the time the tallest and fastest wooden roller coaster in the world, as well as the first with two drops greater than 100 feet.

-'Top Gun Stall,' an inversion where the train slows down upside down

-Western Hemisphere’s first 'High Five,' where two trains pass through an overbanked turn facing each other with the illusion that riders can reach out and “high five” each other

-Zero G Roll where track twists 360 degrees

-A 128-foot drop at 80-degrees

-18 airtime hills

-Four minutes of thrills on nearly 5,000 feet of track, the longest hybrid coaster in the world

It was also unique in that it featured two identical side-by-side tracks. 

For the new Twister Colossus, steel was integrated into the structure to allow for intertwined tracks, steep banks and unrelenting rolls and spirals.

The coaster also features numerous exciting components including a 'Top Gun' element, the western hemisphere’s first 'High Five' element, and a Zero G Roll.  

'At Six Flags, innovation is in our DNA and with Twisted Colossus, innovation will go to an extreme level with record-breaking elements, faster speeds and steeper banks,' said park president Bonnie Rabjohn. 

'This cutting-edge technology marries the best of both classic and modern coaster designs. It is definitely a twist on a traditional wooden coaster experience.'

The Six Flags Magic Mountain theme park, located in Valencia, California, has long been popular among  celebs looking for some, attracting Hollywood A-listers including Hugh Jackman, Carrie Underwood, Jennifer Lawrence, and Nick Cannon and Mariah Carey, to name just a few.

Last October, Kendall Jenner rented out the park for an entire day so she could celebrate her 18th birthday, and avoid all those pesky lines, alongside her family and pals like Jaden Smith.
