The mother lived a comfortable lifestyle and chose 'to line [her] pockets from the state'

A nurse lied to obtain £92,000 in tax credits and lavished the money on luxury holidays, a holiday chalet and a pet pony for her daughter.

Cheryl Henwood, 46, a mother-of-three, had claimed she was a single parent and that two of her children, who are all profoundly deaf, were receiving the highest level of disability living care allowance.

But in reality she was living a very comfortable lifestyle with her police officer husband, Gary Henwood, and only one of her children was receiving the top rate DLA.

She brazenly continued her lies for seven years before eventually being caught out by HM Revenue and Customs in March 2011.

Judge Norman Wright jailed her for 12 months today at Liverpool Crown Court after investigations revealed that she had been living the high life with her ill-gotten gains

Henwood had been using the money to book family holidays to Florida Disney World, Dubai and a Disney cruise.

Ironically, despite her claims to be single, she celebrated her wedding anniversary while in Dubai and had booked another Disney cruise shortly before HMRC fraud investigators discovered what she was up to.

She also had a half share in a holiday chalet in a prime spot in Abersoch, North Wales, where chalets can be worth up to £185,000.

She had bought a jet ski after she and her husband had completed the relevant qualifications.

Henwood denied the charges but was convicted after a trial and had been due to be sentenced last month.

The hearing was adjourned after the judge was told she could pay all the money back.

Her barrister, Paul Becker, today revealed that she had paid £92,075 to HMRC the day after her last appearance and urged the judge to suspend any prison sentence.

Comfortable: the close where Henwood lived comfortably with her husband and children

But after outlining the circumstances of the case Judge Norman Wright concluded: 'There has to be an immediate custodial sentence.'

He accepted evidence that her and her husband had short times of separation 'but for the overwhelming majority of this period your husband was living with you in that household.'

Henwood had been a district nurse in a position of responsibility and relatively high grade income and her husband was a serving police officer and earning a similarly reasonable income, he said.

'So this is not a case that very frequently comes before the courts of people on the breadline or just above trying to keep their head above the water and making false claims.

'You with your twin sources of income had a relatively comfortable background. The only conclusion that can be drawn is you lined your pockets from the state.

'When the authorities came to search your particular premises there outside was a BMW with a personalised plate and a jet ski.

'You are someone with a four bedroom home with ensuite bathroom to the main bedroom, walk in closet and a half-share in a holiday home on the Warren, Abersoch, said to be a very desirable place.'

Exclusive: chalets in the Warren, Abersoch, which Henwood held a share in, can sell for up to of £185,000

Houses on the same road as Henwood - Heythrop Drive, in Heswall, Wirral - are worth an average of £260,000.

He said that there had been holidays to Disney Land, Disney cruises and Dubai and her 14-year-old daughter has a pony and goes show jumping.

He said that Henwood, who has no previous convictions, is no longer in nursing but has set up her own business as a nurse prescriber in the cosmetic side of care.

He accepted that she has long standing depressive illness and that all her children have severe disabilities but pointed out that her sons are 19 and 20 and in higher education.

While it was said her children need her, her husband had been able to change his shift pattern when they were younger and he is available to provide them with care, said Judge Wright.

In one financial year - 2004/2005 - she received £13,715 in tax credits when she was actually entitled to just £26.

In another year, after again maintaining her circumstances had not changed, she should have received £535 but actually obtained £13,688, said Louise Brandon, prosecuting.

'She provided a thoroughly dishonest account of her situation in her application renewals and in telephone calls to the helpline.'

While claiming to be separated from her husband they opened bank accounts together, went on holiday and were involved in various businesses together.

'Two laptops and a memory stick were seized after her arrest and they contained photographs of the family together enjoying holidays. Text messages spoke of purchasing a watch in Dubai and referred to her ‘hubby’,' said Miss Brandon.

Henwood declined to answer questions after her arrest and denied she had been untruthful.

Mr Becker said that Henwood’s new business as a nurse prescriber involves cosmetic procedures such as Botox, but if jailed her registration would lapse and she will not be able to renew it.

He said that her original claim for tax credits was legitimate so it was not a case that was fraudulent from the outset.

He explained that Henwood, who was a nurse in general practice for 20 years, had managed to raise the £92,075 she needs to repay by various means including her childrens’ savings, disposing her half share in the chalet and her oldest son has sold his car.
