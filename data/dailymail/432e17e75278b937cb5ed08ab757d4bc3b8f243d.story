Big Day Out fans are mourning the loss of one of the most highly anticipated music festivals after organisers announced the annual event won't be back in Australia or New Zealand next year.

'While we intend to bring back the festival in future years, we can confirm there will not be a Big Day Out in 2015,' American owners of the event, C3 Presents, confirmed on Thursday in a statement.

The first inkling that the festival hit financial troubles came after promoters said earlier this year the event wouldn't return to Perth in 2015 after poor ticket sales.

Rumours of this year's poor attendance figures and a court dispute between C3 and its former owner AJ Maddah was also reported by Fairfax Media earlier this year.

Maddah later said the Big Day Out was cancelled because of a shortage of headline acts, when a Twitter follower asked him: 'is there a shortage of headliners at the moment? Every O/S festival i see headlined by Outkast'.

'Yes. There's a shortage of headliners on cycle this year. Hence BDO taking year off,' he replied.

The music event has been on the calendar for Australians since 1992 when grunge rockers Nirvana played on the first bill alongside the American rock band Violent Femmes and Aussie outfit You Am I.

Other headlining acts over the years include Iggy Pop, Marilyn Manson, Metallica, Red Hot Chili Peppers, The Ramones, Angus and Julia Stone, The Beastie Boys, Neil Young, M.I.A, Lily Allen, Muse, Pearl Jam and Kanye West.
