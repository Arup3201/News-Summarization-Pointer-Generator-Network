Pulled: The recall includes products like UltraMist Sport, UltraMist Ultra Defense and UltraMist Kids

The maker of Banana Boat sunscreen is recalling some of its spray-on products after reports that a handful of people have caught fire after applying the lotion.

Energizer Holdings is pulling nearly two dozen varieties of UltraMist off store shelves due to the risk that the lotion can ignite when exposed to open flame.

The recall includes products like UltraMist Sport, UltraMist Ultra Defense and UltraMist Kids.

A company spokesman said there have been five reports of people catching fire after applying the sunscreen in the last year.

Four burn cases were reported in the U.S. and one in Canada.

More than 20 million units have been sold since UltraMist launched in 2010, the spokesman said.

Energizer said in a statement that the problem appears to be with UltraMist's spray valve, which is over applying the product. 

As a result, the lotion is taking longer to dry, which raises its flammability risk.

'If a consumer comes into contact with a flame or spark prior to complete drying of the product on the skin, there is a potential for the product to ignite,' the company said.

Consumers who purchased the products are being told not to use them.

More information is available from the manufacturer at 1-800-SAFESUN.

Energizer said it has notified the Food and Drug Administration about the voluntary recall.

Scary: Three separate UltraMist brands have been recalled, including the Kids and Ultra Defense varieties. At least 20 million bottles have been sold since UltraMist's 2010 launch

UltraMist's label warns users: 'Do 
not use in the presence of a flame or spark. Keep away from sources of 
ignition - no smoking.'

But dermatologists say most people don't read such labels.

Dr Michele Green, a dermatologist at New York's Lenox Hill Hospital, said: 'So many people put this on outside, while they're on their way to activities, so I just don't think people are aware of that.'

Dr Green said aerosol sunscreens have become popular in recent years because they're faster and easier to apply, but not necessarily more effective.

Bad burn: In June, Brett Sigworth of Stow, Boston, severely burned his neck, chest and back after he sprayed Banana Boat¿s Ultramist Sport as he stood in front of his grill

'I think the old-fashioned creams apply 
better and seem to protect you better - the sprays just don't seem to 
work as well,' Dr Green said.

In June, Brett Sigworth of Stow, 
Boston, severely burned on his neck, chest and back after he sprayed 
Banana Boat’s Ultramist Sport as he stood in front of his grill.

Mr Sigworth was entertaining friends at his lakeside home in Stow, Massachusetts, when the terrifying incident occurred.

After rubbing the cream in for a few seconds Mr Sigworth told CBS Boston that he walked over to the grill where he 'took one of the holders to move some of the charcoal briquettes around and all of a sudden it went up my arm.'

Probe: After news of Mr Sigworth¿s accident spread, Banana Boat promised an investigation

Recalling the 'scary' experience, Mr Sigworth said the fire spread to wherever he had sprayed the sunscreen.

After news of Mr Sigworth’s accident spread, Banana Boat promised an investigation.

Burn experts said on Friday that the problem appears to be extremely rare.

'We've found no evidence of this happening before the incidents that came to our attention,' said Dan Dillard, executive director of the Burn Prevention Network.

Scorched: Sigworth said the fire spread to wherever he had sprayed the sunscreen

Mr Dillard's group was contacted earlier in the year about two burns related to UltraMist.

Aside from Mr Sigworth's case, a woman suffered burns while working with welding equipment. Both cases resulted in second and third degree burns.

Dillard pointed out that the ingredients used in aerosol sprays are known to be flammable.

'The alcohol and petroleum products listed on the containers are flammable, so the only thing you're missing in the heat triangle is an ignition source,' Dillard said.
