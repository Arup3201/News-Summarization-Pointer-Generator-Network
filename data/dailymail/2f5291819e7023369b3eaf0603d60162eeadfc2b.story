'Actually I feel that at 33 years of age I haven't hit my straps yet and I'm really excited for the next few years.' 

Trego has been plying his trade at the County Ground since joining Somerset for a second spell in 2006. 

The 33-year-old started his career at Somerset before spending time at Kent and Middlesex. He eventually sealed a return to Taunton in 2006.
