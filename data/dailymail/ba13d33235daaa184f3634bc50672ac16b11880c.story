French President Nicolas Sarkozy was told he had 'failed' the French people in a bitter televised debate with his socialist rival Francois Hollande.

Fighting for his political life, Mr Sarkozy, who trails in the polls, was reminded that he had failed to control unemployment and 'abandoned industry'.

Mr Hollande said: 'Unemployment rose by 1 million under Sarkozy – four million in total. A record high – 10 per cent of the population.

Becoming angry, the incumbent retorted by saying: 'It's a lie, it's a lie [...] you're a little slanderer.'

But despite a series of fireworks, neither candidate managed to land a knock-out blow in what observers described as a 'dramatic' debate but which, in reality, will not affect Sunday's vote.

Staring straight at Sarkozy, Hollande said: 'In 2007 when you came to power you said if I don't reduce unemployment to five per cent I will have failed. You indeed failed because it doubled to 10 per cent.'

A robust president hit back claiming there had been little social unrest while he led France for everyone.

Sarkozy, who arrived at the studio with wife Carla Bruni, said he objected to left-wingers likening him to a fascist like Spain's former dictator General Franco or Marshall Petain, who led France's collaborationist Vichy regime during World War II.

'Why not Hitler?' said Sarkozy, as Hollande said he had been likened to 'all manner of zoo animals', without specifying which.

Mr Hollande said on France-3 
television afterwards that he showed voters 'what I was capable of' but 
admitted: ''I don't think this is a debate ... that could bring out new 
voters.'

The campaign has largely focused on domestic issues such as the weak economy, immigration, and integration of French Muslims.

Yet the outcome is considered crucial
to the rest of Europe as well because France is a major economic engine
at a time when the eurozone is trying to climb out of a debt crisis.

Mr Sarkozy said France needs to do 
more to cut spending and high state debt, while Mr Hollande backs 
government-funded stimulus programs.

Both have pushed for similar approaches for the rest of the continent, too.

The two debaters quibbled over 
statistics; they scoffed sarcastically or spoke over each other, pointed
fingers and raised their voices. Their debates came across at times as 
wonkish, esoteric or nitpicking.

'It's a lie! It's a lie!' Mr Sarkozy 
insisted in one heated exchange on economic policies. The Socialist 
contender, meanwhile, forcefully denied some of Mr Sarkozy's claims 
about his intentions, insisting: 'I never said that'.

Mr Hollande accused Mr Sarkozy of 
appointing cronies to government posts, and the president shot back, 
calling his rival 'a little slanderer' and noting he had named some 
ministers from the political left in his first Cabinet.

A high point came as Mr Hollande teed off on a presenter's question about what kind of president he would be.

He tipped back in his chair, folded 
his arms, and launched into a litany of points starting with the phrase:
'As president of the Republic, I ...' on issues like the independence 
of judges, his plan to defer much policy-making to the prime minister or
energy policy.

'You've just gave us a nice speech - 
we got teary-eyed,' retorted Mr Sarkozy, trying to break down some of Mr
Hollande's points. 'Your bit about independence of judges is a joke.'

Mr Hollande repeatedly using one of 
his campaign catchwords: like 'unity' and 'change' to stress the 
contrast between him and the divisive Mr Sarkozy.

Pollsters say the incumbent turned 
off a lot of voters early in his five-year term with his brash personal 
style. A stagnant economy made those troubles worse.

Mr Sarkozy said he is being unfairly 
blamed for France's economic problems after years of crisis, and 
insisted he's not 'the only guilty one'.

'Mr Sarkozy, you would have a hard 
time passing for a victim,' replied Mr Hollande. 'It's never your fault.
You always have a scapegoat. 'It's not me, it's the crisis that hit 
me'.'

Mr Sarkozy said Mr Hollande's economic plans would send France's debt through the roof and hurt the rest of Europe. The Socialist repeated his line that an euro-zone austerity package needs growth-minded policies, too.

Mr Sarkozy stressed, again and again, 
Mr Hollande's inexperience, and suggested the Socialist would not be 
able to handle Europe's debt crisis.

'We avoided the disappearance of 
Greece, that wasn't so easy. ... I'm not sure, Mr Hollande, that you 
would have done much better.'

Mr Hollande fired back: 'Europe isn't 
out of the woods. It is today confronted with a possible resurgence of 
the crisis with a generalised austerity, and I don't want that.'

Mr Hollande further criticised tax 
reforms under Mr Sarkozy seen by leftists as too friendly to the rich. 
Mr Sarkozy countered: 'Saying that we offered gifts to the rich ... is 
slander. It's a lie.' At this, Mr Hollande laughed.

Both the Socialists and conservatives 
have sought ways to lure voters who backed Marine Le Pen, leader of the 
anti-immigrant National Front party who won a stunning 18 per cent of 
the first-round vote.

Mr Sarkozy denounced those who compared him to France's Nazi collaborators because of his tough campaign rhetoric on immigrants. 'Borders are not a bad word,' Mr Sarkozy said about his calls to limit the number of immigrants France takes in.

Mr Hollande, meanwhile, took a similar
position to Mr Sarkozy when it came to special treatment for France's 
large Muslim community.

He said he would not allow separate 
menus in public cafeterias or separate hours in swimming pools for men 
and women to satisfy Muslims' demands, and also said he would firmly 
support France's ban on the face-covering Islamic veils.

Mr Sarkozy took a predator pose from 
the outset, leaning forward on the desk through much of the debate. Mr 
Hollande frequently leaned back in his chair, raising his voice less 
often, and at one point even appeared to yawn.

Mr Sarkozy's assertive posture, in 
another setting, could be seen as a good thing for a debate. But one of 
the things his critics dislike most about him is a personality seen as 
too aggressive, so it may not work in his favour.

The debate – broadcast on France's two main terrestrial channels and on satellite news – was expected to be watched by more than half of the country's 44.5 million voters.

No fewer than 22 cameras were trained on the two politicians as they sat eight feet apart across a single table. Both agreed on a strictly maintained studio temperature of between 19 and 20 degrees Celsius (66 to 68 Fahrenheit).

Sarkozy, who cancelled all engagements on Wednesday so as to be ready for the debate, insisted on chairs that could be adjusted for height.

The 5ft 5ins president is extremely sensitive about his height, and has been known to stand on boxes, and even on tiptoe, in a bid to look taller. There was also a digital clock to show how long each candidate spoke for.

Polls have regularly portrayed him as the most unpopular president in the history of modern France, with critics attacking his brash, moneyed style.

Sarkozy awarded himself a pay rise of 140 per cent within a few days of attaining office in 2007 and then married Bruni, the ex-supermodel and multimillionaire heiress.

If he loses in the second round, Sarkozy will become the first president since Valery Giscard d'Estaing to fail in a re-election bid.

Polls put Hollande seven points ahead of Sarkozy.

In recent days, Sarkozy has been desperately trying to appeal to the far-right National Front vote, saying he will cut down on immigration and strengthen border controls.

He has also warned that Hollande's tax-and-spend plans would cause economic catastrophe.

The latest poll by BVA has Hollande winning the election by 7 percentage points, with the Socialist ahead on 53.5 per cent to Sarkozy's 46.5 per cent.
