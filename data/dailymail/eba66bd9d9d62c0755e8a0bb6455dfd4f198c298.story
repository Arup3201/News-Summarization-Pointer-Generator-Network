Dressed in a white headscarf and hooded coat, this is France’s most wanted woman arriving in Turkey en route to the Syrian war zone.

Hayat Boumeddiene, 26, reached Istanbul a week before her husband, Amedy Coulibaly, carried out the Paris atrocity at a Jewish deli store.

In the video, released by the Turkish authorities yesterday, Boumeddiene and a male companion calmly hand over their passports to a border guard who stamps them, passes them back and sends them on their way.

Video has emerged believed to show Hayat Boumeddiene, the partner of Amedy Coulibaly, at Istanbul airport

In the video, she is shown handing over her passport - Turkey's Prime Minister said she arrived on January 2

The man is believed to be Mehdi Sabri Belhoucine, a 23-year-old Frenchman who is also on the intelligence services’ watch list.

Described as armed and dangerous, Boumeddiene is wanted in connection with last week’s terror attacks on Paris which left 17 people dead. 

She is believed to have helped mastermind the plot, which saw Coulibaly shoot dead a policewoman and execute four hostages at the deli.

Coulibaly, 32, was in the same terror cell as the Kouachi brothers – Cherif, 32, and Said, 34 – who killed 12 in the Charlie Hebdo magazine attack. The three men were killed minutes apart by the French security services.

Intelligence sources in France believe Boumeddiene could have helped plan the attacks, possibly by supplying weapons.

She was initially thought to have been involved in the siege at the kosher store last Friday but it has since emerged she had in fact fled Paris a week earlier, arriving in Turkey on January 2.

Turkey's Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said Boumeddiene arrived in Istanbul from Madrid on January 2 and crossed the border on January 8

She is now thought to be in Syria with Islamic State fighters.

The pictures were released as a close friend called for her to hand herself in to authorities and seek forgiveness. 

The woman, who went to school with Boumeddiene, said she did not believe her friend could have been involved in the attacks but may have been implicated because of her infatuation with her husband, a petty criminal radicalised in prison.

Asked what she would say to her friend if she could speak to her, she told Le Parisian newspaper: ‘I would say, “If you’re part of it, give yourself in and returned to France”. She must repent and ask forgiveness for what has happened.’

The CCTV pictures show Boumeddiene arriving at Istanbul’s Sabiha Gokcen international airport on January 2, having taken a flight from Madrid.

Once in Turkey, she and Belhoucine stayed at Bade Otel, a high-rise hotel in Istanbul, where rooms cost around £38 a night. They had posed as tourists in the ancient city.

They then travelled more than 800 miles to the Turkish city of Sanliurfa, close to the Syrian border.

She crossed into Syria on January 8, Turkish authorities said.

On the same day in Paris her husband shot dead a 27-year-old trainee policewoman in southern Paris and seriously injured a street cleaner who tried to detain him.

Turkish authorities tracked the pair listening in to phone calls and used the mobile data to plot the path they took.

Turkey’s Yeni Safak newspaper reported that the country’s intelligence agency took action following reports that Boumeddiene was in Turkey and put her under surveillance due to her ‘suspicious behaviour’. 

Mevlut Cavusoglu, Turkey’s foreign minister, said: ‘We provided the French with the information as soon as we got it, without them even asking.’

The 26-year-old is now thought to be with her murderous Islamic State allies in Syria after fleeing France. The couple are pictured on a beach

Boumeddiene is believed to have met Coulibaly, pictured left, in Juvisy-sur-Orge, south-east of Paris, while working as a cashier

Coulibaly first came to the attention of police as a teenager and was later convicted of a string of drug and theft offences. He was killed as commandos stormed the kosher supermarket in the French capital

The prime minister, Ahmet Davutoglu, said Turkey should not be blamed for admitting Boumeddiene because there was no arrest notice.

She and the three Paris killers were all known to the security services. Yet despite their fanatical hatred of the West and access to weapons, police decided to stop tracking them in July 2014 as they were considered low risk.

Boumeddiene’s friend added: ‘Once when we were discussing religion, she advised me to leave France, where veiled women are sometimes insulted. She told me: “France is a country that is useless”.

‘Amedy was behind bars, she was alone, distressed and distraught. They were very much in love and spent a lot of time together.’
