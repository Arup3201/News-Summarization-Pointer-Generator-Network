Robbie Keane may have won 138 caps for the Republic of Ireland but it seems the LA Galaxy striker still has some trouble recognising his country's flag.

The 34-year-old proudly showed off his personalised boots for Sunday's MLS Cup final against New England Revolution on Facebook but failed to notice that they were adorned with the flag of the Ivory Coast.

Both flags are made up of three colours - orange, white and green - but the version on Keane's Nike boots had orange instead of green on the left, meaning it actually represented the African nation.

Keane posted the image to his Facebook page on Saturday along with the message: 'Mine and Robert's boots are ready for Sunday. He will be leading the team out with me for the final - very excited!'

And despite the flag mix-up, having his son by his side turned out to be a lucky omen for the former Tottenham striker as he scored the winning goal in California.

Galaxy and Revolution battled to a 1-1 draw in normal time but Keane popped up in extra-time to squeeze the ball beyond Bobby Shuttleworth to seal a 2-1 win. 

The victory proved to be a fitting end to the career of USA legend Landon Donovan, who has decided to retire from football.
