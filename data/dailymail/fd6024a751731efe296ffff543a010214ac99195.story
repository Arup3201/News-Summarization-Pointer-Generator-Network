A free-style skier has been killed in an avalanche close to the Colorado resort his grandfather founded in the 60s.

Tony Seibert, 24, was killed on Tuesday morning as he skied with three others, who were injured in the avalanche.

The champion skier was in a region of the mountains just outside the ski resort boundary, when he was caught in the wave of snow.

Fatal: Freeskier Tony Seibert was killed in an avalanche near Vail resort

Colorado Avalanche Information Center had said the region was at 'considerable risk' earlier in the day, warning skiers that 'cautious route finding' was essential. 

High winds and heavy snowfall are 
believed to have contributed to the avalanche, which started along a 
tree ridge near the mountain pass first founded by Mr Seibert's 
grandfather in the 60s.

First reports of the avalanche came in at about noon, and the injured skiers were rescued shortly after.

'This is an incomprehensible loss' Chris Jarnot, chief operating officer of Vail Mountain, said according to ABC 7.

'I want to acknowledge how integral the Seibert family is to the fabric of our community; their contributions to Vail date back to Vail founder Pete Seibert, Tonyâ€™s grandfather.'

The 24-year-old had recently starred in Climb to Glory, a documentary about the 10th Mountain ski troopers that his grandfather had served with in the Second World War.

Tributes to the University of Colorado graduate poured in on his sister, Lizzie's, Facebook page.

Many
 said they would remember his smile, and one said: 'He will always hold a
 special place in this valley, and in your heart. go out there and ski 
for him'.

The former top 
ranked USSA alpine racer turned his focus to freeskiing when he was 15, 
and was consistently placed in competitions for professional halfpipe 
and big mountain competitions.

The
 three other skiers with him, who have not been named, are being treated
 for minor injuries after being caught in the same avalanche.

They were all skiing in the region known as the East Vail Chutes, which is considered suitable for experienced skiers only.

Vail resort describes the chutes as 
an extremely steep, avalanche prone bowl that drains down to "Interstate
 70 or to East Vail",' ABC 7 reported.

Mr Seibert's death was the second fatality in Colorado this winter, and the fifth nationally.

The region around Vail is said to be treacherous, with several deaths in the east over the past two decades,according to the Denver Post.
