It has been a staple of the Japanese diet for centuries but now seaweed could be making a more pronounced appearance on UK menus after being commercially harvested in England for the first time.

Retired lawyer Rory MacPhee, 56, is the only person in the country with official permission to gather dulse seaweed which commands prices of up to £200 a kilogram.

He has been given his licence by the Queen through the Crown Estate.

Tucking into a clump of seaweed at dinner time could help stave off heart attacks, say researchers.

They have discovered key ingredients in the plant that help lower blood pressure, similar to commonly prescribed drugs.

According to a major study in 2011, seaweed is a rich source of proteins known as bioactive peptides – which are also found in milk.

These chemicals have a similar effect to ACE inhibitor drugs, which are widely prescribed to help lower blood pressure and prevent heart attacks and strokes.

The
edible seaweed is much sought after as a delicacy but it cannot be 
collected and sold without permission from landowners and environment 
agencies.

Seaweed is very low in calories and some scientists claim it helps weight loss by preventing the absorption of fat.

Japanese researchers found that rats fed a certain type of seaweed lost 10 per cent of their weight.

Mr MacPhee of Falmouth, Cornwall, said people already harvesting seaweed for sale in England are doing so illegally.

He says he hopes British consumers will take the healthy 'sea vegetable' to their hearts - like the Japanese.

It is worth up to £200 a kilo to restaurants, hotels and sushi shops where it is served up to diners.

Rory said: 'Seaweed is rich in nutrients and extremely tasty - a lot of the top chefs are beginning to use it in their dishes.

'It can be used in soup and bread and its even a substitute for bacon when smoked.

'You
can go out and forage for seaweed or dandelion leaves or whatever as 
long as you are doing it for you or your family to eat.

'But if you are going to sell it then you need a licence.

'You need permission from the landowner, conservation agencies, and to have food management systems in place.'

Taking off: Seaweed is rarely eaten in Britain but has been a staple of the Japanese diet for centuries

Dulse seaweed is popular in Japan where it is a key ingredient used to achieve the so-called fifth taste, known as 'umami.'

Mr MacPhee gathers the seaweed along the Cornish coast and then flattens out the leaves before laying it on rocks to sun-dry.

The seaweed is then dried and cured and ground into strips and a powder and poured into test tubes and sold.

Mr MacPhee  a boatbuilder and furniture-maker, said areas for growth in seaweed harvesting could include putting up ropes for it to grow on by offshore windfarms.

He
said: "In these days of economic doom and gloom the food market remains
strong, with a tremendously exciting new development in the gathering 
and selling of sea vegetables."

Mr MacPhee  is a founding member of the Seaweed Health Foundation which has around 40 members across the country.

Its aim is to promote research into seaweed as part of a healthy diet.

Among
well-known fans is Heston Blumenthal, who has recommended using kelp – 
or seaweed – to make NHS food more flavoursome without using additional 
salt.

The idea is to 
increase levels of umami - a Japanese term for the so-called fifth taste
after sweet, sour, bitter and salty - which is a flavour found in foods
such as parmesan cheese, tomatoes and shiitake mushrooms

IngredientsAbout 500g edible seaweedPotatoes (about 500g)SpicesA couple of handfuls of flourWaterBeef fatMethod 1. Gather seaweed - we used Gutweed, although you could also try Dulse (which you should boil first). Wash thoroughly in fresh water to remove any sand and roughly chop.

2. Grate the potato and mix with the seaweed.

3. Mix a small amount of flour with spices from your store cupboard and water to form a paste. Add the paste to your potato/seaweed mix. This acts as an egg substitute to hold everything together.

4. Form burger shaped patties with your hands.

5. Fry in 2-3 tablespoons of beef fat for a few minutes on each side until the potato is cooked and the seaweed is crispy.
