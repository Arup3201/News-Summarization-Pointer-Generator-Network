A council is planning to spend £2.5million on a traveller site for just 13 caravans - which will cost as much as the average first time buyer spends to get on the property ladder.

Bath and North East Somerset Council will spend £190,000 on each pitch on the green belt site while neighbouring properties sell for just £160,000.

Opposition councillors have slammed the project and insisted it would be cheaper to buy properties for gypsies to live in.

Greenfield site: The travellers moved into this picturesque site on the outskirts of Bath, Somerset, without permission around five years ago. It is now set to be transformed into a permanent site at taxpayers' expense

Mess: The muddy site is currently littered with rubbish and has no waste collection. The council said if it was turned into a permanent traveller site they would be able to collect council tax

The travellers moved onto the council-owned site without permission five years ago.

Once the building work is finished, each one of the 13 secluded spots on the green belt site will have its own driveway and street lighting.

The entire site will also be surrounded with soundproofing to block out noise from the nearby road and railway so the travellers can get a good night's sleep.

The Liberal Democrat-controlled council has allocated £1.72million to spend on the site, with a further £750,000 potentially being provided by central government.

If they spend the full amount, it will work out as £190,000 per pitch, while the average price paid by first time buyers to get on the property ladder was £189,000 in December.

A two-storey masionette is currently on sale on the same road for £159,000.

Tim Warren, Conservative councillor for the Mendip area, said: 'The issue is the cost - it would be cheaper to buy 13 houses with drives.

'We have a moral duty to make traveller sites but we also have a moral duty to look after taxpayers' money.

Location: The traveller's site is just off the Lower Bristol Road (marked in red) on the outskirts of Bath. The city centre is on the right of this map, and the site is around two miles out of the centre

Traveller site: A council is planning on spending up to £2.5million to turn this make this temporary traveller site permanent with 13 pitches - at a cost of £190,000 each

Row: Opposition councillors have condemned the cost of turning this into a permanent travellers' site - and said it would be cheaper to buy everyone a house

'If you took every penny that Twerton collects in council tax, that site would use 85 per cent of the money.'

Liz Richardson, Shadow Cabinet Member for Housing and Chew Valley North Councillor said: 'I haven't ever come across another site that has cost that kind of money.

'It's not as if they're putting them into Georgian terraces.

'The average spend across the UK for a traveller site is about £63,000. And the council owns this land - we haven't even got to buy it.'

The site, in Twerton, Bath, is located in a field off the main road two miles outside the city centre.

It is expected to be ready by March 2015 but planning permission is yet to be granted. There will be eight permanent plots and five plots for caravans in transit.

A spokesman for Bath and North East Somerset Council said they hoped to keep the final cost of the project down to £1.72million.

Tim Ball, Twerton councillor and Cabinet Member for Homes and Planning, said the council has set a £1.8m 'ceiling' figure for its contribution towards the project.

He blamed the high cost on the fact that the site is located both in a green belt and on a World Heritage Site.

The site is currently a transit traveller area but it is not yet regulated by the council meaning that no rent or council tax can be collected.

High cost: Making this traveller site permanent will cost up to £2.5million - with the money being spent on soundproofing, new roads and lighting

But once completed the site will generate £6,000 per tenant per year and become 'cost neutral' Mr Ball added.

'Once the site becomes official the residents will have to pay rents and council tax,' he said.

Mr Ball said that by creating an official site, the council will avoid costs such as moving travellers on and taking legal action.

'There's no official transit site in Bath and North East Somerset - that's a requirement for the government,' he said.

Mr Ball said that his constituents had not raised any concerns about the site.

He said: 'The community accepts that the site needs to be cleaned up - no one has come to me saying there is a problem.'

Jonathan Isaby, Chief Executive of the Taxpayers' Alliance said that it would be cheaper to buy everyone a house than build the pitches.

'Taxpayers will rightly question why they have been landed with such a large bill for the development of this site,' he said.

'Providing pitches for travellers shouldn't cost the earth, and at this price the authorities could just about buy a house for every pitch, let alone build one.

'The council need to set a reasonable budget, and then stick to it, to ensure the whole scheme provides value for taxpayers’ money.'
