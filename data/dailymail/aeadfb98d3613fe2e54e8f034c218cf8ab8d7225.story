A year after they ditched their family newsletter and sent their festive message for a rap music video, the Holderness family are back with a another cheesy cover.

Last year's Christmas greeting - a cover of rap song Miami by Will Smith -  was viewed more than 15 million times on YouTube and the family could be set to reach a similar tally again with 350,000 views in two days.

In this year's song, the Holderness family, from Raleigh, North Carolina, take their loved ones through the year's achievements - all while wearing pyjamas.

The Holderness family have made another cheesy music video cover instead of sending out a newsletter

Last year's Christmas greeting by Penn Holderness, his wife, Kim, and their children Lola (right) and Penn Charles (left) was viewed more than 15 million times on YouTube

Penn Holderness, his wife, Kim, and their children Lola, seven, and Penn Charles, five, created the video as an annual newsletter for their family, and anyone else, to enjoy.

Rocking guitars and mini-drum kits around their house, the family sing their own version of It's the End of the World as We Know It, by rock band R.E.M., adding in their own lyrics about what they have done this year.

Like last year's version, they are wearing matching pyjamas as they dance about their home, reliving the last 12 months. 

Personal tales from throughout 2014 include Lola overcoming her fear of rollercoasters and Penn Charles' love for Transformers.

Mr Holderness gave up his job as a news anchor on WNCN at the end of last year to start a video production company. 

Singing of their own business venture, Mr Holderness belts out that his wife 'spends all week on the phone with CEOs making sure our company has some work making videos'.

Mrs Holderness adds, while wearing her pyjamas outside a coffee shop: 'It's been a great year but if next year sucks, hope they'll hire us at Starbucks.'

Speaking to Today.com, she revealed the unexpected stress of having to live up to their 2013 song. 

She said: 'Since January, friends and strangers have been asking us what we were planning. We had no idea. NONE.

'Every song I heard on the radio I would try to morph into some sort of family song. Everything felt forced and awful.

'We wanted it to be the authentic holiday video newsletter we had sent our friends and family the year before. While going for a run on Thanksgiving morning Penn looked at me and said, “I think I got it”.

'The song is fast. Really fast. And it sounds exactly like our year felt — quick, crazy, and happy.'
