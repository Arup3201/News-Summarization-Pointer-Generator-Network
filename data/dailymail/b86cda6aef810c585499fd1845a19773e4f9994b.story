After a 200-mile journey, former Navy SEAL sniper Chris Kyle was buried on Tuesday as his family members and fellow SEALS looked on amid the sounds of drums and bagpipes.

A giant Texas flag flew at half-mast over the Texas State Cemetery in Austin as Kyle,  considered to be the deadliest sniper in U.S. military history, was laid to rest.

Kyle,  37, who completed four tours in Iraq and wrote the best-selling book 'American Sniper' was shot dead by a fellow veteran along with a friend earlier this month while at a North Texas gun range.

Supporters: American flags and hand-made signs lined Interstate 35 as the funeral procession passed through Waco, Texas, making the final journey to Austin, where Kyle would be buried

A white hearse carrying Kyle's 
flag-draped coffin was among 200 vehicles in a procession that left 
Tuesday morning from Kyle's hometown of Midlothian, about 25 miles 
southwest of Dallas.

Many motorists pulled to the side of roads to watch the procession that included motorcycles, motor coaches, police cruisers and other vehicles throughout moments of light rain and even hail.

Larry Key, one of about 100 Patriot Guard Riders who gathered for the event, said he came in tribute to Kyle's service.

'It's our way of honoring Chris and his family,' said Key, a Vietnam veteran from Denton.

In Austin, hundreds of people gathered on roads stretching nearly a mile from the cemetery.

Many who came to watch the procession were combat veterans in leather jackets who parked their motorcycles three wide around the permitted area of the gravesite.

Others were businessmen in suits on their lunch break from the nearby Capitol, families with strollers and at least one jogger taking a break from an afternoon run.

Riders: Some of around 100 Patriot Guard Riders leaded the long funeral procession as they traveled south along Interstate 35

Respects: A man standing along Interstate 35 salutes in the rain as the hearse carrying the remains of the slain former Navy SEAL passed

Heartfelt goodbyes: Among the flags held high in Kyle's memory were signs of support for his family, including his wife and two young children he leaves behind

Mike Lamb, 24, stood about a half-mile from the cemetery wearing a mustard yellow Marine Corps shirt and holding a sign that read, 'Fair Winds and Calm Seas Frogman! R.I.P.'

Lamb said he called in sick from work to see the procession. Because of that, he was at first reluctant to give his name.

But he then rationalized that it didn't matter. Next month, Lamb is leaving for boot camp in the Marines.

'(Kyle) was the last person that I would have expected to end up like that,' Lamb said. 'Because he was so into Wounded Warriors and helping soldiers with (post-traumatic stress disorder). He was a warrior overseas and at home.'

An Iraq War veteran, Eddie Ray Routh, 25, has been charged in the killings of Kyle and his friend Chad Littlefield. Routh's brother-in-law told authorities that Routh had recently been diagnosed with PTSD.

Resilience: Bruce McLeod of Plano, Texas, is pelted by hail stones as he waits for the funeral procession to pass under the Interstate 35 overpass in Waxahachie

Tears: Tracy and Lucinda Larimore, of Henderson, Nevada, embraced after the procession passed them in Kyle's hometown of Midlothian, Texas

Same heart: Among those who turned out were nearby residents, combat veterans, men and women in business suits, Boy Scouts and at least one man and future Marine who called in sick from work to pay his respects

Goodbyes: People lined up, braving the cold and rain, from young to old to say their goodbyes and pay their respects

Riders: About 100 Patriot Guard Riders gathered to show their support while many other motorcyclists were combat veterans in leather jackets who parked their motorcycles three wide around the permitted area of the gravesite

Authorities say Kyle, Littlefield and Routh arrived together at the Rough Creek Lodge shooting range, about 50 miles southwest of Fort Worth, on the afternoon of Feb. 2. Routh later fled in Kyle's truck.

According to a search warrant, Routh told his sister and brother-in-law that the men 'were out shooting target practice and he couldn't trust them so he killed them before they could kill him.'

On Monday, some 7,000 people attended a two-hour memorial service for Kyle at Cowboys Stadium in Arlington. Kyle's coffin was placed at the Dallas Cowboys' star at midfield.

Crowds queued to enter the Cowboys 
Stadium so they could hear memories of a kind and loving family man, a 
practical joker and a proud veteran.

His widow, Taya Kyle, told the crowd she was broken but that her family would 'put one foot in front of the other' to get through their grief.

She said she told her two children that they will remember Kyle's silly side, Texas twang and the prayers they prayed together.

Mourners: On Monday a large crowd packed a memorial service to Kyle in the Cowboys stadium

Honored: Taya Kyle and her children walked behind the coffin of her husband Chris Kyle during his memorial service in Dallas

Tribute: The Cowboys stadium was a fitting venue
 for the memorial to Kyle, a proud Texan. Heart-breaking messages,

program

Heartbreaking:
 Letters to Chris Kyle from his young children were printed on the 
memorial program which also carried the couple's wedding picture

'Thank you Chris thank you for loving me, all of me,' his wife said through tears.

'God worked through you to make me the woman I was supposed to be...You taught me I was okay just the way I am.Â 

'I stand before you a broken woman 
but I am now and always will be a wife of a man who was a warrior both 
on and off the battlefield.'

The couple's children wrote heart-breaking tributes to him on the memorial program alongside 
pictures of their parents wedding day.

'You are the best dad ever. I never 
wanted you to die, I miss your heart', one of the messages simply signed
 by 'Baby Girl' from Kyle's daughter read.

The other signed by 'Bubba' added: 'One of the best things that has happened to me is you. I love you dad. I always will.'

Eddie Ray Routh has been charged over
 the shootings - it is alleged the murdered pair were trying to help the
 marine corporal recover from PTSD by taking him out for the day.

Paying
 respects: Thousands queued to join a memorial service to former Navy 
Seal Chris Kyle. The author of 'American Sniper' was shot earlier this 
month on a shooting range in Texas

Tearful: Many of those paying tribute to Chris Kyle broke down. His wife Taya, pictured, bravely shared her memories of her husband

Courage: Taya Kyle made a heartfelt tribute to her husband. Through her tears she told of how much her husband supported her

Kyle, who also received two Silver Stars, had worked tirelessly to support his fellow comrades since leaving the Navy in 2009.

The man dubbed the 'most lethal 
sniper in U.S. history' after killing 150 was the founder of a 
non-profit supporting veterans providing them with fitness equipment.

He and Littlefield,
 who wasn't a military man, regularly took veterans to the shooting range
 in order to support them.

Littlefield's funeral was held Friday in
 Midlothian. Afterward, Littlefield's relatives said the outing with 
Routh was intended to be therapeutic.

On Monday Taya Kyle took a moment in her tribute to remind her children how important they were to their father.

'I cherish the look on you dad's face
 when you would both come running across the house to take a flying leap
 into his arms,' she said.

'I hope you know with all your heart that being your dad 
was the highlight of his life.'

'You made him feel like the best dad in the world...You loved him in a way that was different to any way he has ever known.'

Selfless: The mother of a soldier killed in Iraq told the memorial service of how Kyle selflessly offered her the proceeds of his best-selling book to support her family.
