There is no escaping the irony. Just days after a Heineken Cup semi-final took place in front of 56,058 empty seats at Twickenham, fans are in up-roar about a dearth of tickets for the Amlin Challenge Cup Final.

Followers of Bath and Northampton have launched a petition to have the secondary European final switched from Cardiff Arms Park to a larger venue. Their anger is understandable, as official allocations of 1,000 tickets to each of the English clubs have been rapidly sold out.

Rugby has to be smarter and more flexible in these tricky situations, to present its best face to the world. Saracens v Clermont Auvergne should have been staged at the Madejski Stadium or Stadium:mk, in order to make a crowd of 25,942 represent a glorious spectacle. Mark McCall’s victors deserved better than to claim their finest European win in front of a two-thirds empty arena.

No show: Saracens remarkable 46-6 Heineken Cup semi-final win over Clermont was watched by 25,942 fans

Electric: The fans in the cavernous stadium did their best, but a smaller venue would have done them justice

Dominant: Sarries Chris Ashton celebrates one of his tries in front of 50,058 empty seats

Tournament organisers are at the mercy of results, hence the need for contingency planning, especially in the Challenge Cup. If two French sides were contesting the final in the Welsh capital, a capacity of 12,125 would be ample, but two of England’s best-supported clubs can bring hordes across the border, so Cardiff City Stadium should have been lined up as a stand-by option. Surely there is insurance to cover such a scenario.

The sport is on a multi-speed development curve. Some teams now draw vast armies in their wake, while others make do with modest platoons. Munster lie top of the man-power table, so much so that a loud cluster of their fans detoured to Twickenham en route to Marseille. Their commitment and fervour is phenomenal.

Travelling support is a useful gauge of the game’s appeal. Irish sides are at the forefront with Ulster and Leinster, in that order, matching Munster’s red hordes for fanaticism if not for numbers. In England, Leicester are No 1, followed by Northampton, Bath and Gloucester.

Minimal support: Just 1000 fans from each club will see Bath play Northampton in the Amlin Challenge Cup final

More must be done to encourage weekly migrations. Sensible kick-off times are essential. Why the trend for 5pm starts? Saracens may charter trains to ferry their fans home from Cardiff after a late finish to the Heineken final on May 24.

Clubs need to encourage away-days; as Sale are doing by switching from Friday night matches to Saturday afternoons. Paying spectators whose allegiance takes them on distant trips want the game to be part of a day out or weekend break, so they must be accommodated.

Rugby is not football; it needs to work harder to earn its popularity.

The blizzard of tributes for Jacques Burger’s destructive master-class for Saracens at Twickenham last Saturday came as due recognition for a ferocious competitor.

His defensive onslaught was a herculean effort by anyone’s standards, but certainly for a player whose career was nearly ended by a knee condition which still requires constant management.

Burger’s refusal to be beaten by injury strikes a chord, as do his feats as an elite performer from a second-tier rugby nation. The Namibian flanker is savouring most of his career highlights in club colours, but next year’s World Cup may provide a fitting Test peak.

Tributes: Jacques Burger's effort in the Heineken Cup semi-final was worthy of the praises he's received

Top level: After a European Cup final, the Namibia star could line-up at the World Cup against the All Blacks

If Namibia qualify for the tournament as ‘Africa 1’ from a four-team play-off in Madagascar this summer, the prize would be a place in Pool C and a showdown with the All Blacks at the Olympic Stadium in Stratford.

While the result would be a foregone conclusion, Burger would certainly make the world champions know they had been in a battle.

On the subject of recognition, there should be more for the man in charge of Bath’s charge into title contention this season.

The West Country club finished seventh in the Aviva Premiership last season, but under Mike Ford they have soared to third place in this campaign, while also shifting away from a territorial approach to a more all-singing, all-dancing attacking game.

Yet, the ex-England defence coach has not
 been included in the shortlist for the Premiership Director of Rugby of
 the Year award, which features Richard Cockerill (Leicester), Steve 
Diamond (Sale) and Mark McCall (Saracens).

Unsung: Bath director of rugby Mike Ford should be recognised for his work with the club this season

Ford and his opposite number at The Rec on Friday night, Northampton’s Jim Mallinder, can feel hard done by.

The clash between their teams will go a long way to shaping the play-off equation and Bath are without Kyle Eastmond, who has been rested, while the Saints have left out Lions wing George North, who has been struggling to recover from a calf injury.

Rugby’s officiating crisis goes on. The authorities have opened two cans of worms; the first involving the crack-down on dangerous ‘tip tackles’.

In the Heineken Cup quarter-finals, Jared Payne of Ulster was sent off for taking Saracens’ Alex Goode out in the air, but last Friday Northampton wing Jamie Elliott was shown a yellow card for the same offence, after bringing down Mike Brown.

Inconsistent: Ulster's Jared Payne was sent off but Saints' Jamie Elliott got a yellow for the same offence

Contact was minimal, but the incident provided further proof that referees are ruling based on the severity of the damage caused, rather than meeting the demands for uniformity from on-high.

The zero tolerance stance has created chaos. Secondly, increased use of Television Match Officials has become a farce, with referees pre-empting their verdict by watching big screens in stadiums, or being damned if they don’t refer every marginal call ‘upstairs’. 

Last Sunday, Wayne Barnes and his assistant, Luke Pearce, correctly ruled that Simon Zebo had touched down for Munster, but they were berated in some quarters for not confirming by video.

But they were right; the TMO is there to help in the event of on-field doubt. More common-sense is needed.

Super Rugby is in expansion mode again, with an announcement on Thursday that the 15-team tournament will be replaced by a rejigged 18-team structure from 2016.

The ‘Australasian’ Group will feature the current five sides from Australia and five from New Zealand, while the South African Group will feature a sixth franchise from that country, plus one from Argentina and another.

Branching out: Last season's Super Rugby champions The Chiefs will soon be in a 18-team competition

The inclusion of an Argentinian team, despite the logistical challenges that creates, is a welcome move with the bigger global picture in mind, but the selection of the 18th team is likely to be a commercial exercise.

The SANZAR consensus is that this side should come from the ‘Asian market’ - with profit apparently the prime consideration.

What there should be instead is a Pacific islands team, perhaps based outside Auckland and supported by IRB funding. Why not really go for broke with an islands team and a franchise based in, say, Tokyo, as part of the Australasian group, and another African side in a new location – possibly Kenya? Pipe dreams…
