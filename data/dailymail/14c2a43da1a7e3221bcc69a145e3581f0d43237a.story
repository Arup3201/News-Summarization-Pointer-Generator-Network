Many children have imaginary friends.

But few of those BFFs are called Joe Biden.

Meet three-year-old Avery Bral, who has regular 'phone calls' with the United States Vice President.

Avery, of Clive, Iowa, first became infatuated with Biden when she saw him speaking on TV several months ago. Since then, she has had dozens of 'conversations' with him via her toy phone.

'For the next couple months, every time she was on her phone it was Joe Biden,' the toddler's mother, Erica Bral, said. When asked why she loved Biden, Avery told reporters: 'I just do.'

Earlier this year, Avery's grandmother, Becky Burke, posted a message on Biden's website, informing him of his littlest fan and their regular 'chats', according to KCCI News 8.

Then, last Wednesday night, she answered the phone - and Biden was on the other end.

'He said, "This is Joe Biden" and I said, "Who the hell is this?' said Ms Burke. 'And he said, "This is Joe Biden", and I said, ‘I’m so sorry, I’m so sorry I said that to you.”

Bemused: 'Every time she was on her phone it was Joe Biden,' the toddler's mother, Erica Bral (above), said

During the  call, Ms Burke discovered that Biden had received her online message and wanted to reach out to Avery and her family.

Unfortunately, Avery was not available to speak - but her grandmother had a five-minute conversation with the politician about their families and grandchildren.

At the end of the call, Biden told Ms Burke he would send the toddler a personal note in the mail.

But despite his popularity, he has stiff competition - from Avery's stuffed sheep, Lamby.
