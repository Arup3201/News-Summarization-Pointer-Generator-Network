Parents of teenage One Direction fans, hide your wallets now: the leopard print T-shirt worn by One Direction star Harry Styles is to be auctioned off for charity.

The unwashed top, which was worn by Styles to Burberry's S/S14 show in London in September, joins a catalogue of celebrity-owned items due to go on sale later this month.

Bidding for the £195 T-shirt is expected to be fierce, with the winning buyer likely to have to shell out a four figure sum for the garment.

Those who miss out on Styles' stylish T-shirt can turn their attention to one of the other celebrity owned pieces, which include a Burberry dress belonging to Donna Air, a Union Jack guitar signed by Liam Gallagher and a suit signed by David Beckham. 

Also included in the auction, which will take place on November 13th, are a Ronnie Wood signed Dolce & Gabbana shirt and another that will be worn by Jenson Button to this weekend's Abu Dhabi Grand Prix before going on sale.

Proceeds from the sale, which is being hosted on style website hardlyeverwornit.com, will go to UNICEF, which helps women and children in more than 190 countries.

Styles' fashion credentials have had a boost in recent months, following a number of high profile appearances in which the singer showed off his increasingly sophisticated sense of style.

Gone are the slouchy hoodies, backwards caps and comedy onesies of his earlier career while in their place are Saint Laurent boots, chic peacoats and rock n' roll skinny jeans.

His favourite heart-print Burberry shirt, worn to the premiere of One Direction: This Is Us, sparked a slew of imitations with both men and women rushing to copy the look.

While fans won't be able to get their hands on the heart-print shirt - yet - the leopard print number being auctioned off is, at least, bang on trend - much like Styles himself.
