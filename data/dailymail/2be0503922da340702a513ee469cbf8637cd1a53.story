An 83-year-old dementia sufferer has been mauled to death by four pit bulls - including two puppies - after they attacked her at her North Carolina home.

Alameanor Dial, who lived with her granddaughter in Robeson County, was sitting on a chair on her porch last Thursday when the animals suddenly pounced and dragged her to the ground. 

She was rushed to New Hanover Medical Center with head, arm and leg injuries, before being airlifted to UNC Hospital in Chapel Hill. But despite medics' best efforts, she died on Sunday night.

Ms Dial's daughter-in-law, Linda Dial, said she arrived at the house on the 1900 block of Gaddys Mill Road in Rowland with her husband and son after receiving a phone call from a horrified neighbor.

'[The neighbor] heard hollering and screaming for help. He then saw her on the ground. You can see where the dogs dragged her off the porch and across her flower garden,' Linda said.

When the trio arrived, they found Ms Dial lying in the nearby garden. She had reportedly been badly mauled on her head, arms and legs.

The pit bulls - a three-year-old male, a two-year-old female and two puppies, owned by the victim's granddaughter - had run away, according to The Robesonian.

'It seemed like she wasn’t aware of what happened to her, which is good. She wasn’t screaming or anything. She just said, "hold my hand I’m cold",' said Linda. 

Following the mauling, one of the pit bulls was shot and killed by Ms Dial's grandson. The others were then caught by animal control officers, before being tested for rabies.

Despite gaining negative results, they were euthanized, CarolinaLive.com reported.

Bill Smith, health director for Robeson County, told WMBF News that officials were investigating the cause of the attack, but added that the dogs were 'cared for and had shelter and food'.

However, Linda claimed her mother-in-law's relatives and neighbors had repeatedly asked officials to restrain the animals, which were known to be vicious and roamed in a large fenced-in area.  

'Nobody foresaw this, but everybody knew it was a dangerous situation,' she said, adding that the victim suffered from dementia and used a walker to get around.

'Everybody said, "something has got to happen, we just hope they don’t bother Miss Dial".’

When sheriff's deputies and animal control workers arrived at the scene, Linda reportedly told them that her family had been trying to 'get someone to intervene for months'.

'They said, "we know, we’re so sorry, we’re so sorry",' she said.

 The attack remains under investigation.
