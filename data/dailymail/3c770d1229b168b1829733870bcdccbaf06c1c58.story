Kris Commons has been given compassionate leave to miss Celtic’s flight to Gran Canaria following the death of an uncle.

The remainder of Ronny Deila’s squad travelled out on Tuesday morning to a week-long training camp in the Canary Islands that will include friendly matches against PSV Eindhoven and Sparta Prague.

Commons was, however, a notable absentee following his man-of-the-match display in Monday night’s 2-0 win over Kilmarnock that took Celtic to within a point of Premiership leaders Aberdeen.

It’s understood the 31-year-old, born in Mansfield, was informed of the death of an uncle after the final whistle at Rugby Park and was immediately allowed to travel south to be with his family.

Commons had excelled in the match in Ayrshire, despite not finding the net, and his performance rekindle speculation over his future at the club.

The former Scotland player is out of contract at the end of the season, with talks over an extension stalling over the length and structure of the deal. Representative Martin Reilly confirmed that the sticking point remains.

‘Kris pledged his future to Celtic by retiring from international football to prolong his club career,’ said Reilly. ‘We feel that should be rewarded. It’s not about vast sums of money.’

Neil Lennon’s Bolton Wanderers are chief among a number of English outfits monitoring Commons’ position.

The ex-Derby County midfielder is now eligible to speak to interested clubs about a free transfer switch at the end of the season, but Bolton hope to make a cash offer for a January move if Lennon can juggle his squad to free up funds.

Deila remains adamant that he wants Commons to remain at Parkhead, although he has regularly stated the club must be careful when it comes to contract extensions for players in their 30s.

Meanwhile, banned Celtic winger Aleksandar Tonev is set to be handed some game time in Gran Canaria, according to club coach John Kennedy.

The 24-year-old Bulgarian, on loan from Aston Villa, is currently serving a seven-match suspension after being found guilty by an SFA Judicial Panel of racially abusing Aberdeen defender Shay Logan.

‘He’s part of our squad albeit he’s serving a suspension just now,’ said Kennedy. ‘If he’s eligible to play in these games then we’ll certainly look to use him for fitness and to keep him going. The training time will be very important for him at this stage.’
