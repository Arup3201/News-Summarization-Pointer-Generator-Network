'Unexplained death': Esme Blore was taken to hospital on Saturday

THE parents of a public schoolgirl who died after being taken ill at the Reading Festival have spoken of their ‘unbearable’ pain over her death.Esme Blore, 17, had gone to the music festival with a group of friends and had tweeted excitedly about seeing her favourite bands.

But on Saturday she left the event early because she was feeling unwell and was taken to hospital. Esme was discharged but on Monday she collapsed at her family home.

She was taken to another hospital but doctors were unable to save her.

Police are treating her death as ‘unexplained’ and are investigating whether it could be linked to drugs.

There has also been speculation that her drink may have been spiked at the festival.Esme’s devastated father, Sebastian Blore-Rimmer, said the family were in the dark about what could have caused her death.

Speaking at the family’s £600,000 detached home in Stevington, near Bedford, he said: ‘At the moment we are in limbo. We don’t really know what to do until we find out how and why she died.

‘We just want to know the facts and at the moment we don’t know anything. Waiting around is just unbearable.’

Excited: Esme had been posting messages on social media as the Reading festival approached saying how much she was looking forward to going

Mr Blore-Rimmer, 48, added that he 
hoped that the wait for answers would finally be over after the 
post-mortem examination is held today.

‘We don’t want to pre-empt the results,’ he said. ‘Only then can we really comment.’
His wife Sharon, 44, said: ‘I could give all the tributes in the world, but nothing is going to bring my baby back.’

Esme, a pupil at the £4,000-a-term 
Bedford Girls’ School, had gone to the festival with a group of her 
friends to watch some of her favourite rock bands including Don Broco 
perform.

She had posted messages on her 
Twitter page in the days running up to the event talking of her 
excitement. But on Saturday she fell ill and was taken to the Royal 
Berkshire Hospital in Reading.
She was discharged and returned to her home where she collapsed and had to be taken to Northampton General Hospital on Monday.

Laugh and smile: Esme was attending the festival with a group of friends

Mr Blore-Rimmer was driving home so 
he could pack an overnight bag when staff telephoned telling him to 
return immediately. Esme’s condition had deteriorated and she died hours
later.
Northamptonshire and Thames Valley police, along with the two hospitals,
are working together to establish the circumstances of the death.

A Northamptonshire Police spokesman 
said: ‘The investigation into the cause of her death is ongoing and as 
such we are unable to comment any further. Our thoughts are with her 
friends and family at this sad time.’

A Thames Valley Police spokesman 
added: ‘We are aware there has been a lot of speculation surrounding the
cause of her death, and numerous rumours have been circulating.

‘All the relevant agencies are 
liaising closely with each other to establish if there is any risk to 
public health, which does not seem to be the case at the moment.’

The spokesman urged social network 
users to consider the family’s feelings when writing about Esme after a 
troll posted a distasteful  message about her death.
