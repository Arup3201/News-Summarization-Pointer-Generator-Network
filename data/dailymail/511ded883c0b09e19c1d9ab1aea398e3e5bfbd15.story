Arsene Wenger has revealed that star man Alexis Sanchez is willing to defy medical advice to line up for Arsenal in Saturday's game against Tottenham.

Ahead of the north London clash, the Gunners boss would love to have his top scorer available but knows he needs to be wary of rushing him back.  

The Chilean international is currently out nursing a hamstring injury but Wenger has admitted there's still a chance he could feature.

Arsene Wenger has admitted that Alexis Sanchez could feature, but that he does not want to rush him back and risk further injury

Speaking at his press conference on Friday he said: 'He wants to play, of course, he's very keen, he feels he can defy the medical people because he is so keen to play that he thinks he can get over strains.

'I don't know yet, I need medical advice on that, and I need as well to see what he can do in training.' 

Despite Sanchez's claims, Wenger knows he has enough options to replace him. 

'We have enough offensive options, we are not short,' he added. 'I think we have enough offensive power, if all of us perform individually and collectively, we can get above that.'

Arsenal's squad trained at London Colney on Friday ahead of their short trip across north London to White Hart Lane on Saturday lunchtime. New signing Krystian Bielik was heavily involved, as the squad looked to impress Wenger enough to secure themselves a place in one of Arsenal's biggest games of the season.

With both sides chasing the Champions Leagues places and with only two points separating them, the Arsenal boss says the north London derby is still very special. 

He said: 'Yes of course because the two teams are fighting very hard to be at the top of the league. It can be a spectacular game.'

The Frenchman knows his side will be facing a hostile atmosphere at White Hart Lane on Saturday but is confident his players have the focus to see the game through.

The impressive performances of Francis Coquelin have been a welcome boost for Wenger, whose Arsenal side are on the up after three wins

'In the derbies the home ground is not too significant sometimes because it’s a high commitment, high pace and we just focus on the quality of our game and our performance no matter where we play. We’ll do the same [on Saturday],' he added.

The Gunners are in a rich vein of form winning their past three games, including an impressive victory away against Manchester City and Wenger puts this down to the confidence of his squad. 

'Confidence, the fact that we defend better maybe,' he said. 'We have another good test [on Saturday] on that aspect of our game. After, football is fragile when you have not got confidence.

'When you have positive results behind you it makes everybody stronger and we have also recovered nearly all our defenders now, and that is of course important.'

With Arsenal challenging for the top four, it's coming to a crucial part of the season and in the past they've been criticised for their squad size but the Frenchman feels he has a squad which can challenge. 

He said: 'I feel yes, of course, that is the target for us until the end of the season. 

'We are four months in front of us, they are very important to everybody, and it's how well we can focus in every single game, how well we can perform together, that will decide our season.'

Wenger was also highly critical of the January transfer window and thinks that it should be scrapped.

'I must say, basically nothing happened. It pushes even more an idea forward - let's completely get rid of [the transfer window], and go from season to season with the same players.

'It can disturb the cohesion of a group within the season. When the players don’t play in October or the end of September, they already think that they may move in January. 

'You lose them and in our job it’s important that everybody is on board. I find the transfer window disturbant.'

Arsenal face a red hot Harry Kane on Saturday and the Gunners boss has been impressed with the striker in the first half of the season.

He said: 'He was absolutely outstanding until now. It’s impressive the way he has made his way through. His personality shows on the pitch. 

'He’s one of the players that since the start of the season has made a big impact in the Premier League.'

In light of Kane's arrival onto the Premier League scene, Wenger has backed the introduction of younger players and says if they can handle themselves against the best - then they have a chance.

He replied: 'I’m convinced of that. That’s why I always say that the quota system is a false and superficial protection. 

'When the players have the quality, they play, no matter where they are from. That’s why we have to support that. 

'Let’s go for quality and get our young players to be confronted with top-quality players. If they make it then, they are really good players.' 

Bellerin has been in impressive form since coming into the first team to replace Mathieu Debuchy earlier in the season
