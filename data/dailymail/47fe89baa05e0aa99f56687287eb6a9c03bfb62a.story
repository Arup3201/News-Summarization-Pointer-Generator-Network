Britain's worst driver: John Mehmet, 30, was given the unofficial title by a judge who jailed him for four years at Blackfriar's Crown Court today

A motorist was branded Britain's worst driver by a judge after smashing into two motorbikes, driving on the wrong side and flipping his car in a police chase that ended with him fleeing police dogs on foot.

John Mehmet, 30, of Ham, east London, was given the undesirable title by a judge at Blackfriars Crown Court today who stated that it was 'difficult to imagine a worse case of dangerous driving.'

The pursuit began when police spotted Mehmet, wanted for other offences at the time, behind the wheel of a Nissan Juke in north London at around 11am on January 14.

When they approached him, he immediately sped off, driving straight into a motorbike and injuring the rider.

Instead of stopping to check if the biker was okay, Mehmet ignored the crash and drove away causing police to momentarily lose sight of him.

But instead of inconspicuously blending in with traffic, the reckless motorist was next seen dangerously overtaking a number of cars as he drove down the wrong side of the road.

He eventually lost control of the car near Liverpool Street station when he hit a raised zebra crossing at high speed before flipping and smashing into a second motorbike.

The rider of that bike was hospitalised with two broken wrists and a broken leg and the BMW 1200GS bike burst into flames.

After wrecking his car, Mehmet fled the scene on foot but was eventually caught by a police dog unit.

He was given four years and two months in jail for a series of motoring offences, including causing serious injury by dangerous driving, driving while disqualified and driving while uninsured.

Detective Constable Rebekah Hymas said: 'Mehmet's sole intention was to get away from the police at any cost even if it meant jeopardising the safety of pedestrians and other road users.

'This was a very serious incident and I am pleased with the sentence he received.

'I hope the sentence is a warning to anyone else considering driving in this manner.'

Mehmet was also disqualified from driving for six years.
