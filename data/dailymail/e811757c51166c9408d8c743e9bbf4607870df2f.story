A dying mother who has been told she has just 18 months to live would have been saved if she started getting cancer treatment five months earlier, a court heard.

Katie Maytum, now 35, is suing the Welsh NHS for £750,000, claiming surgeons ignored official guidelines and refused her treatment because she was too young.

The mother-of-two, who has terminal breast cancer, told the High Court in Cardiff that she was forced to wait five and half months before being seen by a specialist.

She has now been told by doctors that she has only less than two years to live, robbing her of the chance to see her children grow up.

A cancer expert told the High Court in Cardiff that by causing a five-month delay, surgeons at Abertawe Bro Morgannwg University Health Board had denied Ms Maytum life-saving treatment.

Consultant surgeon Frederick Skidmore said: 'My opinion is that she would have been cured of the cancer on the balance of probabilities.

'Looking at the results of 20,000 women of a similar age, we find 90% of those women are cured of the disease if treated at the earliest opportunity.'

But a breast cancer surgeon, for the defence, said Ms Maytum's cancer was so aggressive that it would not have responded to treatment.

Nigel Bundred, a professor of surgical oncology, said: 'The fact she relapsed despite all the surgery and most high-tech therapy available shows she is in the small percentage who would have died.'

He added: 'If the key doesn't fit the lock then the door won't open and the patient isn't cured. It's black and white.'

Professor Bundred also told the court Ms Maytum could have lessened her chances of survival because she took the pill during treatment.

He said that taking the contraceptive pill could have affected her body's ability to fight against tumours and risk complications in surgery.

'If I saw somebody on the pill I would ask them to stop it because it increases the risk of blood clots at surgery. I'd ask them to stop it for that reason alone,' he said.

'If I stopped the pill then by the time that person came for surgery the tumour would have stopped growing.'

Ms Maytum was 31 when she went to her GP after noticing a lump in her breast in July 2010.

He sent an 'urgent referral' to Princess of Wales Hospital in Bridgend, South Wales, but surgeon Vummiti Murali-Krishnan downgraded her to 'routine' and classed the case as not urgent because she was under 35.

Ms Maytum finally had  chemotherapy in 2011 and was cancer-free for several years until a lump appeared in her neck in April this year.

She was told by doctors the cancer had spread to her bones and she had only 18 months to live.

A renowned cancer expert later told the hearing NHS surgeons missed the chance to save Ms Maytum 'by a mile'.

Research has found that the pill is found to slightly increase the risk of breast cancer, particularly in younger women.

This risk only returns back to normal after ten years of stopping its use.

It may also increase the risk of developing cervical cancer.

But the combined pill is found to actually lower the risk of certain other cancers such as ovarian, womb and bowel cancer. 

Professor Justin Stebbing, who has published more than 500 papers on the disease, branded claims she would not have been cured if she had received treatment earlier as 'ridiculous and preposterous'.

Prof Stebbing said a crucial 'window of opportunity' to treat Ms Maytum was 'missed by a mile'.

He strongly rejected claims that Ms Maytum would not have survived treatment because her cancer was so aggressive.

 He said: 'Katie is not a chemotherapy resistant individual and you can just look at her to know that.

'With women we know you have to act more quickly because the breast cancer is a lot more aggressive.

'To say that Katie would have died on the same day is just ridiculous - it's just the most preposterous thing I've heard in a semi-academic forum.'

Prof Stebbing, who sees up to 30 cancer patients a day, added: 'This cancer was allowed to grow for a great many months. When you have a young woman with a lump in her breast you have a window of opportunity and that was missed by a mile here.

'As far as I can tell 'common sense doesn't matter, she was going to die anyway so why bother treating her in the first place?' is what I heard a lot of this morning.'

Ms Maytum, of Maesteg, South Wales, is due to marry her partner next month. Her children Megan, 14, and Zac, 10, will be by her side at the service.

The hearing continues.
