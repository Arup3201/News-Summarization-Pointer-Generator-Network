MP Andrew Laming has been suspended from federal parliament for a day for pouring oil on the floor of the Federation Chamber.

The Liberal-National Party member for Bowman, Queensland, was speaking in the chamber about the cruise liner industry on Tuesday night when he picked up two bottles of bunker oil.

He poured some of the contents of thick black fuel onto his hand and it spilled onto the desk and floor of the chamber.

Queensland MP Andrew Laming has been suspended from federal parliament for a day for pouring oil on the floor of the Federation Chamber

Speaker Bronwyn Bishop said such action was 'totally disorderly, disrespectful of the house and the Federation Chamber' and potentially dangerous to people in the chamber

Speaker Bronwyn Bishop said such action was 'totally disorderly, disrespectful of the house and the Federation Chamber' and potentially dangerous to people in the chamber.

She said it had caused damage which was now being repaired.

'I do apologise,' Mr Laming told parliament on Wednesday. He was then suspended for 24 hours after the Speaker 'named' him under parliamentary rules.

Mr Laming's inflammatory stunt came towards the end of a speech about cruise ships using fuels containing high levels of sulphur while docking near residential communities.   

Gone rogue: Mr Laming was scolded by Speaker Bronwyn Bishop and banished from the Parliament for 24 hours

Mr Laming (pictured, doing a handstand and drinking beer) received national media attention in 2013 when he successfully did a handstand and skolled a beer

Mr Laming said: 'This stuff is revolting. It should not be burnt anywhere near where children live. We can do better than that. 

Then, as members cried out and the Deputy Speaker demanded he not use props, Mr Laming poured oil over his hands.  

'We can burn the clean stuff. It is eminently available. We should be using that, and not this.

'I insist on the cruise-ship industry cleaning up their act and burning the clean stuff like they do in the rest of the world.

Cruise ship pollution has become a hot political issue in the New South Wales state election, particularly in seats which host cruise terminals such as Balmain. 

The Member for Bowman, Mr Laming argued it is a federal issue as all affected Australian communities required a resolution.

The LNP representative came under the spotlight for another stunt two years ago - one that wasn't political so much as a party trick.

He was photographed simultaneously performing a handstand and skolling a beer on Australia Day 2013.
