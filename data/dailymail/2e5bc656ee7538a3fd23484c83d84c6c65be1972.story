Edward Loudell, pictured outside Blackfriars Crown Court, changed his plea to guilty and admitted assaulting trainee solicitor Ross Knight

A disgraced city lawyer is facing jail after today admitting a drunken attack on a trainee colleague after an office party, leaving his career in tatters.

Edward Loudell, of prestigious law firm Pinsent Masons, put trainee solicitor Ross Knight, 26, into a headlock and punched him repeatedly in the head after the firm's event to celebrate a London office move.

Loudell, 28, was 'arrogant' and 'evasive' when police arrived on the scene on March 25 last year, smirking at them and reeking of alcohol.

He had left the work party with Mr Knight, who required hospital treatment for his injuries, at roughly 11pm to continue drinking in another pub.

As the pair walked through Hatton Garden, London's famous diamond and jewellery quarter, to their third pub of the night, Loudell put down his briefcase, grabbed Mr Knight in a headlock and shoved him into a shop doorway.

He initially denied the charge and claimed he was acting in self-defence after giving the younger man a warning about earlier drunken behaviour, saying that Mr Knight became aggressive towards him and yelled 'I'm going to bash you up!'

But the shamed solicitor, who has a 2007 conviction for affray, changed his plea to guilty, admitting acutal bodily harm at Blackfriars Crown Court today.

He has since resigned from Pinsent Masons and plans to go abroad to teach English if he is spared a jail term when sentenced at a later date.

Mark Graffius, defending, told the court: 'The long and short of it is this has been a disaster for his career.'

Jurors were shown CCTV footage which showed the alleged attack by Loudell, of Clarelawn Avenue, Sheen.

Tim Devlin, prosecuting, said: 'There were four people - Mr Loudell and Mr Knight were walking behind.

'As they were walking Mr Loudell suddenly set upon Mr Knight. He put his bag on the floor, grabbed Mr Knight around the neck, pushed him into a shop front down onto the floor.

'Mr Loudell was striking Mr Knight. Mr Knight fell to the ground, eventually getting on his side and is trying to ward off hits from Mr Loudell.

'Mr Loudell is talking to him and eventually allows him to get up. What happens next is that they then speak to each other and Mr Loudell grabs Mr Knight around the neck again.

'He puts him in a headlock again back onto the floor. They get up and fall down again and then roll behind a tree.'

Police and the ambulance service were called to the scene on Greville Street by concerned neighbours.

PC Victoria Borley told the court how Loudell had deliberately misunderstood her line of questioning.

She said: 'He smirked. I noticed that he smelled very strongly of alcohol and he appeared to be drunk. I also noticed that he did not appear to have any visible injuries.

'I would describe his demeanour as arrogant and evasive to questions. I felt he thought he was cleverer than me and he could deliberately appear to misunderstand very simple questions that I was asking him.'

When asked to give examples of her questions and Loudell's answers, PC Borley said: 'When I asked if he was injured he said what do you mean by injured?

'Mr Knight by contrast was very shocked. He was clearly shocked. He was upset and had visible facial injuries.'

Giving evidence, Mr Knight said: 'I was on the floor. At the time I had no idea where it was. After I was told where I was found - it was outside.

'Edward Loudell is on top of me and I am being punched on the head. A police car comes around the corner - I can see the blue flashing lights.'

He added: "I can remember trying to put my hands up to try and say stop.'
