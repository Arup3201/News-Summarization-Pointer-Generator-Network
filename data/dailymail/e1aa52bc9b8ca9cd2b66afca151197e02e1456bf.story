A man whose wife plotted to have him killed on his birthday has revealed the deep scars he was left with after being nearly stabbed to death.

Chris Soteriou was in a coma for 10 days following the attack in Melbourne on January 2, 2010, which was orchestrated by his wife of 18 years, Vicky Soterious.

Soterious, who is currently serving nine years in jail, had organised for her lover, Ari Dimitrakis, to stab Chris as they walked from a Greek restaurant in Fitzroy to their car 500m away after his 44th birthday party.

Chris still bares the horrific scars after his wife had organised for her lover, Ari Dimitrakis, to stab him as they walked from a Greek restaurant in Fitzroy to their car 500m away after his 44th birthday party

'It sends shivers down my spine that the person you loved and treasured organised to kill you,' Chris told Channel 7's Sunday Night.

Soterious had preemptively parked the couple's car in a dimly lit street and had organised for her lover to attack when they returned from the restaurant late that night.

Despite going missing for 30 minutes during dinner so she could show Dimitrakis where the car was parked, Chris had no reason to suspect what the mother of their three children had planned. 

As the couple approached the car, Chris said he saw a man crouching down and his wife broke away and went to stand in the middle of the street.

It was then Dimitrakis 'slit my throat'.

'There was no feeling. I didn’t feel any pain, I just it was more shock. I just felt the blood run down my chest and felt this warm, warm fluid running down my body,' he said.

CCTV cameras captured the couple walking back to their car just minutes before Chris was attacked

‘I remember saying if I don’t make it just look after the kids. She must have been watching me getting killed in the middle of the street.'

Chris only managed to survive the deep stab wounds because two off-duty doctors were nearby and helped to try and stabilise the bleeding as paramedics arrived.

‘I didn’t feel any pain. I went to sleep peacefully. Bright light… it’s all I could see,' Chris said.

Ten days later he woke from his coma and was met by his crying wife. On January 15 she went to police and confessed to plotting to kill Chris with her lover after hearing authorities were closing in on the attacker.

'I’ve just come to confess that Ari and I organised it. I know, it was stupid. It was absolutely silly,' she said in a recorded police interview.

It was later revealed Soterious had unsuccessfully tried to convince another lover to kill her husband five years before Chris was stabbed

Soterious later changed her mind and pleaded not guilty in court. She was sentenced to a maximum of 12 years.

Chris said his wife had given him a birthday card the morning he was stabbed and it was signed 'thank you for loving me so much, the wife that adores you'.

In sentencing, the judge said: 'Your husband had provided you with an affluent lifestyle and it appears in the sentiments expressed in the birthday card that you were prepared to have him believe he was loved and appreciated in return. In truth you wanted him dead.'

It was later revealed Soterious had unsuccessfully tried to convince another lover to kill her husband five years before Chris was stabbed.

After she was sentenced, former lover Tony Aleksovsky said Soterious had offered him $50,000 to murder Chris during their 2005 affair.

'I thought it was a bad joke you know if I thought she was serious I was going to go to the police,' he told the program. 'I said "If you don't love him, why don't you divorce him?".'

Vicky went to police and confessed to plotting to kill Chris with her lover after hearing authorities were closing in on the attacker. She later changed her mind and pleaded not guilty when she was charged

As a wealthy engineer, Chris had regularly 'spoilt' his wife with lavish and expensive gifts.

'As a divorced husband I was probably worth $3 million, as a dead husband I was probably worth $7 million,' he said.

Chris said he has tried to put Soterious' betrayal behind him as he focuses on raising their two young twins. Their teenage daughter cut ties with Chris after her mother told her Chris had plotted his own murder.

'(The twins) have asked me where their mother is and that was a result of my little girl seeing my scars,' Chris said.

'She asked who did that and I said "mummy did it". They asked where their mum is and I told them "she’s in jail". That’s one of the questions I’m challenged with. How do I tell them?'

Chris has written a book about his experience. Love You to Death: A Story of Sex, Betrayal and Murder Gone Wrong by Megan Norris (Five Mile Press) is out this week.
