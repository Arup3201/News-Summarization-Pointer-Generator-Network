Heavyweight boxer Deontay Wilder taught an internet troll a lesson in respect after meeting him for a fight in a Los Angeles gym.

Charlie Zelenoff, who subjected Wilder to years of abuse on social media and harassed him with phone calls, challenged the 28-year-old to a bout to settle their differences.

The 2008 Olympic bronze medallist accepted Zelenoff's offer and met him at the Hollywood Boxing Gym on Wednesday evening.

Revenge: Deontay Wilder was able to teach internet troll Charlie Zelenoff a lesson after receiving abuse

Wilder was keen to get revenge on the wannabe fighter after claiming that Zelenoff racially abused him and made comments about his daughter, who suffers from spina bifida.

Their bout began on the gym floor when Zelenoff threw a wild right hand before appearing to run for the door.

Wilder soon caught up with his opponent and knocked him to the floor twice in quick succession.

Despite 
his arrogance prior to the fight, Zelenoff then backed off as members of
 Wilder's entourage attempted to calm him down and stop him from 
delivering a knockout blow.

The
 undefeated heavyweight can be heard shouting: 'Don’t you ever call me a
 n***** again. Don’t you ever say you’re going to tape my daughter.'

Powerful: Wilder knocks out British boxer Audley Harrison at the Motorpoint Arena in Sheffield last year

Not impressed: Boxer Curtis Woodhouse drove to the street of a Twitter user who abused him in March, 2013

The
 video concludes with Wilder chasing Zelenoff out of the building, 
although the troll insists on claiming: 'I’m the best. I’m still the 
best.'

Wilder took his fight against online abuse one step further than British boxer Curtis Woodhouse, who drove to confront Twitter user @Jimmyob88 in March, 2013.

The former footballer tracked down the road on which his abuser lived, before 'Jimmy' tweeted a grovelling apology and Woodhouse backed off.
