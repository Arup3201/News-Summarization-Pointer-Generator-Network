Target discarded a system of security alarms alerting them to their landmark data breach, which left over 40 million customers vulnerable to credit card theft and identity fraud, garnered the department store more than 90 lawsuits and is expected to cost them billions of dollars in ongoing damage control.

New information obtained by Bloomberg Businessweek on Thursday has shown the United States' no. 3 retailer detected potentially malicious activity during last year's hack but that staff declined to take immediate action.

The online attack started sometime before Thanksgiving 2013, when hackers were able to install malware - malicious software - onto Target's central security system, which was designed to steal every credit card transacted at the company's 1,797 U.S. stores.

The stolen information was being stored on a special server, and at a certain point - likely to be after the holiday shopping spike - the hackers would export all of it out of the database and into their control.

Was it preventable? The credit cards of over 40 million Target customers were said to have been compromised by last years data breach, which was designed to attack all 1,797 US stores. While security technology picked up the hack, it was not enough for US officials to put a stop to it

However Target was prepared for such a scam, according to Bloomberg, and had installed a $1.6 million malware detection system six months earlier.

Made by computer security firm FireEye (FEYE), which also services the CIA and the Pentagon, the system was manned around-the-clock by a security team in Bangalore, India.

If Banagalore noticed anything suspicious, they would immediately notify Target's security operations center in Minneapolis.

On Saturday November 30, the hackers began moving the stolen credit card numbers to 'staging points' spread across the US - in order to cover their tracks - before redirecting the data to their own computers in Russia.

Bangalore realized the breach and contacted Target headquarters, however the officials in Minneapolis overlooked the warnings.

Some 40 million credit card numbers and 70 million addresses, phone numbers and other pieces of personal information were then successfully extracted from the Target mainframe.

It is not known what happened inside Target for the sirens to be ignored, however computer experts say the company was likely to receive hundreds of such alerts on a daily basis.

On Friday, company spokeswoman Molly Snyder acknowledged the company declined to act early enough.

FireEye is a sophisticated computer security company used by both the CIA and the Pentagon. The FEYE system Target were using at the time picked up the malicious activity, however U.S. did not immediately act upon it

'With the benefit of hindsight, we are investigating whether if different judgments had been made the outcome may have been different,' Snyder said in a statement.

Two security experts who advise organizations in responding to cyber attacks and both have experience using FireEye technology said that security personnel typically don't get excited about such generic alerts because FireEye does not provide much information about those threats.

'They are bombarded with alerts. They get so many that they just don't respond to everything,' said Shane Shook, an executive with Cylance Inc.

'It is completely understandable how this happened.'

John Strand, owner of Black Hills Information Security, said that it was easy to paint Target as being incompetent, given the severity of the breach, but that it was not fair to do so.

'Target is a huge organization. They probably get hundreds of these alerts a day,' he said.

'We can always look for someone to blame. Sometimes it just doesn't work that way.'

Target Chief Financial Officer John Mulligan told a congressional committee in February that the company only began investigating after on December 12, when the U.S. Justice Department warned the company about suspicious activity involving payment cards.

Within three days, nearly all the malicious software had been removed from Target's cash registers, he said.

'Through our investigation, we learned that after these criminals entered our network, a small amount of their activity was logged and surfaced to our team,' Snyder said.

'That activity was evaluated and acted upon.

Some 40 million credit and debit card accounts were affected by the data breach that happened between Nov. 27 and Dec. 15 - just as the holiday shopping season was getting into gear

'Based on their interpretation and evaluation of that activity, the team determined that it did not warrant immediate follow up.'

Target shares fell 2 percent to $59.86 in late afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange after the company released the statement.

Some 40 million payment card records were stolen from the retailer, along with 70 million other records with customer information such as addresses and telephone numbers.

Congress is investigating the breach along with lapses at other retailers, and credit card companies were pushing for better security.

Target also faces dozens of potential class-action lawsuits and action from banks that could seek reimbursement for millions of dollars in losses due to fraud and the cost of card replacements.

A spokesman for FireEye declined to comment.

FireEye shares were up 1.8 percent at $79.05 on Nasdaq.

Representatives for the U.S. Secret Service and Verizon Communications Inc, which are investigating Target's breach, declined to comment.

FireEye has a function that automatically deletes malicious software, but it had been turned off by Target's security team before the hackers' attack, the Bloomberg report said, citing two people who audited FireEye's role after the breach.

Shook and Strand said that the vast majority of FireEye's customers turn off that functionality because it is known for incorrectly flagging data as malware, which can halt email and Web traffic for business users.

'FireEye ... is cutting edge,' Strand said.

'But it takes love and care and feeding. You have to watch it and monitor it.'
