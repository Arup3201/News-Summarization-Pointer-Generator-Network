Mitt Romney's commanding performance in Wednesday night's first presidential debate has started to yield results as he took a two-point lead in a respected national poll.

The Republican candidate has also raised $12million in online donations over the last couple of days. The two-point boost came via the Rasmussen Reports daily Presidential Tracking Poll.

The news comes as Barack Obama's lacklustre showing continues to be mocked by top comedians who are strong supporters of the President - including the cast of Saturday Night Live.

The poll shows Mitt Romney attracting support from 49% of voters nationwide, while President Obama earns the vote from 47%.

In addition, Mr Romney's campaign took in a donation 
haul of $12million via his website in just 48 hours after the conclusion
 of the debate in Denver, according to the Wall Street Journal.

The
 bump in fundraising was even bigger than those recorded after the 
announcement of Paul Ryan as Mr Romney's running mate and the Supreme 
Court's decision to uphold Mr Obama's healthcare law.

In addition, 60 per cent of those donating online had never given money to the campaign before.

The increase in small contributions from first-time donors is a significant change for Mr Romney's campaign.

The
 former governor of Massachusetts has previously relied more on large 
donations from wealthy supporters, in contrast to Mr Obama's grassroots 
network of givers.

Other indicators of campaign strength 
have also been promising for Mr Romney - aides have reported seeing an 
upturn in the number of volunteers at offices around the country.

It is still too early to tell whether 
the aftermath of the debate will shore up the candidate's position in 
the polls over the long run, but early signs are encouraging for the 
Republican.

Rasmussen polls showed Mr Romney 
gaining a lead in Florida and Virginia, both states which he must win in
 order to have a realistic shot at the White House.

Mr Obama has been the target of 
political satirists ever since his disappointing debate performance - 
and the jokes do not seem to be letting up.

Jay Leno made a reference to the huge audience for the televised event during his talk show on Friday.

'They're saying close to 60 million 
people may have watched the debate,' he said. 'In fact, the only person 
who didn't tune in, I think, was President Obama.'

Comedian Bill Maher, a passionate 
Obama supporter who gave $1million to a Democratic super PAC, also had 
harsh words for the President.

'It looks like he took my million and spent it all on weed,' Mr Maher said.

However, Mr Obama also had good news 
as it was revealed that he and the Democratic party had together raised 
$181million in September, the most lucrative month of his re-election 
campaign,

The President's fundraising haul topped the $114 million raised during the month of August.

He said in a message on Twitter that 
more than 1.8million people donated in September, including over 500,000
 who had not donated before in 2008 or 2012.

The $181million was slightly less than Mr Obama's record of $190million in September 2008.
