Jailed: Susan Warren stole £340,000 from the farm supply firm where she worked over seven years

A crooked mother-of-two stole more than £340,000 from the farming supply firm where she worked - and spent most of it on ordinary everyday items like food.

Susan Warren, 57, has been jailed  after bosses discovered her seven-year ruse at Fearing International, which sells livestock-rearing equipment  in Brixworth, Northamptonshire.

Northampton Crown Court heard she wrote false invoices for stock which had never been bought and siphoned the funds into her own account.

Her scam began in 2004 and went unnoticed until 2011 at the firm, which sells equipment including sheep shampoo, ear tags, castration pliers and stress balls for pigs.

The court heard the Warren, of Daventry, Northamptonshire,  used the names of real suppliers on her invoices including Provini Ltd, based in Lichfield, Staffordshire.

Her crimes were discovered when her firm’s parent company Ritchey Limited discovered a ‘spike’ in the purchase ledger account and launched a disciplinary hearing.

Further investigations showed Warren had been making substantial payments into her own bank and credit card accounts for seven years.

Yet despite being more than £35,000 in debt, Warren was using the money to buy everyday items such as supermarket shopping in a bid to 'maintain family relations', the court heard.

Steven Evans, defending, said: 'Here was a woman with low self-esteem. She had a desperate desire to gain credibility in a bid to maintain family relations.

'While this money was being taken she was already in debt. She continued to take loans from banks and other lenders.

The funds vanished from Fearing International, whose headquarters (pictured) are in rural Northamptonshire

'This is not spending vast amounts of money on fast cars or exotic locations - this is just spending, spending, spending on everyday matters at a significant level.'

Warren admitted theft and was jailed today for two-and-a-half years at Northampton Crown Court.

Recorder Ian Dove said: 'I understand the reason you did this was to seek the approval and endorsement of your family.

'The truth of the matter is that you have let them down very badly indeed.'
