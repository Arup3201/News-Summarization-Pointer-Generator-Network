Denver quarterback Peyton Manning made NFL history on Sunday night when he broke Brett Favre's record for career touchdown passes by throwing his 509th scoring pass during the second quarter of the Broncos' game against the San Francisco 49ers.

Manning went into the Sunday night showdown two TDs shy of Favre's record of 508 and finished with four touchdown passes on 22-of-26 passing for 318 yards in just three quarters of work.

He surpassed Favre with an eight-yard pass that was caught in the end zone by wide receiver Demaryius Thomas just before halftime in the Broncos' emphatic 42-17 thrashing of the San Francisco 49ers.

Manning acknowledged rapturous applause from the home crowd, who rose as one to salute the 38-year-old as his team-mates briefly played keep-away to keep the record football from Manning before finally handing the ball to the future Hall Of Famer.

Thomas tossed the ball over Manning to Emmanuel Sanders, who lobbed it to Wes Welker. 

From there, Welker dished it back to Sanders, who flipped it to Julius Thomas - all of Manning's favorite targets getting into the act as Manning ran around like a kid trying to get his lunch sack back.

‘Those guys are all great athletes, and my vertical leap isn't what it used to be. I haven't played keep-away since I was eight years old,’ Manning said. ‘That is something I will always remember.’

The Broncos (5-1) had actually talked about doing something like that but Manning said he was surprised his teammates went through with it.

He shouldn't have been, Demaryius Thomas said, revealing that Manning actually had them practice it Friday.

‘It's easy. You did that when you were kids,’ Thomas said. ‘It's like keep the ball away from the guy in the middle.’

Come to think of it, Manning said he deserved to get picked on ‘based on my non-graceful play when I tripped on the play before.’

Manning finally got the ball along with congratulations from his teammates and coaches. The souvenir won't end up on Manning's mantle, however - the Pro Football Hall of Fame has a nice spot all ready for it.

Manning had a hand in most of the game's biggest moments, from Emmanuel Sanders' first TD catch as a Bronco to Wes Welker's record-tying 39-yard catch and run against the exasperated 49ers.

‘I'm not sure what their coaches do,’ 49ers safety Eric Reid said. ‘They probably don't have to do much. 

'When he's out there on the field, he recognizes the defense and makes audibles, he does it all. You're playing against a coordinator when he's out there. He's definitely one of the best, if not the best ever.’

Favre needed 302 games to set the previous record in 2010 while playing for the Minnesota Vikings, while Manning broke the mark in 246 - 208 with the Indianapolis Colts and 38 with Denver.

Manning, who added a 510th touchdown before leaving the game early as the Broncos demolished the 49ers 42-17, typically downplayed his accomplishment and said he planned to place a telephone call to Favre in the next day or so.

'I've always been a fan of quarterbacks, whether it's Brett Favre, or Dan Marino, or John Elway, so I'm very honored and humbled to join a pretty unique club,' he told reporters.

'Brett's always one of my favorite players. He played the position with so much passion, great toughness and great productivity. I just want to tell him thanks, and I'm honored to join this club with him.'

Manning was happy he set the record at home - and in a winning effort.

'I was glad it was here in Denver. The fact we won the game certainly allows you to celebrate with your team. The touchdowns I've thrown have helped us win a lot of games. That's the only reason (the record is) somewhat special.'

Even as the game was in half-time, Favre was already congratulating Manning on his Twitter page.

'Well deserved Peyton,' he tweeted. 'Congratulations on breaking my record. Onto600.'

NBA players LeBron James and Kevin Durant also offered their congratulations.

'Legend. OneOfTheGreats,' tweeted James.

'We take him for granted because he's so consistent but we are witnessing a living legend!' added Durant.

Manning missed the entire 2011 season with a serious, potentially career-ending neck injury that required multiple surgeries.

Manning started Sunday's game needing three touchdowns to overtake Favre.

He wasted little time making his mark, notching touchdowns in the first quarter, firstly to Emmanuel Sanders and then to Wes Welker to tie Favre's record.
