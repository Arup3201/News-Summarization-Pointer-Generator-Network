Seattle police have released two never-before-seen images taken at the scene of Kurt Cobain's death after they announced they were re-examining evidence in the two decade-old case.

One of the tragic photographs, which comes from four rolls of undeveloped film stumbled upon last month, shows a small cigar box containing a spoon, possibly with heroin residue on it, needles and a lighter laying on the floor next to a cigarette butt and a pair of dark sunglasses.

The second picture shows the box closed, next to cash, a woolly hat and an open wallet that appears to display Cobain's ID.

Potential leads? This picture shows the box containing drug paraphernalia closed, next to cash, a hat and a wallet that displays what looks like Cobain's ID

Detective Renee Witt, a spokeswoman for the Seattle Police Department, revealed Thursday that
 detectives were taking a second look at the circumstances surrounding 
the Nirvana star's suicide after the new evidence was uncovered.

The rolls of film were found in sealed bags by an officer who was going through Cobain's case file ahead of the approaching 20th anniversary of the singer's death.

The images are said to detail the scene in sharper detail than the Polaroid pictures used in the original 1994 investigation causing police to review all evidence.

However, authorities have stopped short of declaring a full re-opening of the case and police are reluctant to suggest much will come from the new photos.

New evidence: Police in Seattle have announced that new photographs of the scene of Kurt Cobain's suicide have been uncovered and developed

Scene: A police officer stands guard on the back porch of Kurt Cobain's garage where Cobain's body was found early 08 April 1994 in Seattle, WA, after an apparently self-inflicted gunshot wound

The Nevermind star was discovered 
dead of an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound in his home near Lake 
Washington by electrician Gary Smith, who raised the alarm.

The
 Seattle chief medical examiner ruled that Cobain, who was 27 at the 
time, had ended his own life three days earlier after leaving a rehab 
facility for heroin addiction.

Authorities
 recovered a note, but speculation has been rife since that the Smells 
Like Teen Spirit singer did not commit suicide.

Indeed,
 the 1998 documentary Kurt and Courtney by filmmaker Nick Broomfield 
infamously made allusions to Cobain's widow, Courtney Love.

Better detail: The police say the images are clearer than Polaroids used in the original investigation

Identification: One picture shows an open wallet containing what appears to be Cobain's ID

No evidence has ever been found that the Hole singer was in any way responsible for the rock icon's death.

Authorities initially ruled Cobain's death a suicide and said he had taken a lethal dose of heroin prior to shooting himself.

Since his band rocketed to fame in the early 1990s, Cobain had struggled to deal with the public perceptions of him and suffered depression and battled addiction.

According to local Seattle station KIRO, authorities developed four rolls of 35mm film found last month by the King County Sheriff's Office photo lab under high security.

Detective Renee Witt, a spokesperson for
 the Seattle Police, told the Washington Post the pictures have a slight green tint because of deterioration but still reveal more than the original polaroids.

KIRO reported that the image of Cobain's dead 
body will never be released.

As Nirvana fans across the globe went wild with speculation that police were to officially reopen the investigation into his death, Seattle police were quick to clarify the pictures and the status of the case.

'Despite an erroneous news report, we have not 'reopened' the investigation into the suicide of Kurt Cobain,' the Seattle Police Department tweeted from a verified account.

The police went on to explain on Twitter
 that the case was simply being reviewed in anticipation of the 20th 
anniversary of Cobain's untimely death.

Almost 20 years to the day speculation still rages amongst Nirvana fans as to the circumstances surrounding Kurt Cobain's death.

His death certificate stated that he died as a result of a 'contact perforating shotgun wound to the head', and concluded it a suicide.

However here are the leading theories that have grown up around his death

Homicide:

Lack of blood at the scene: Seattle public access host Richard Lee obtained a video taped from outside Cobain's garage looking into his house.

The scene around the body showed what Lee claimed was a distinct lack of blood for a point-blank shotgun blast to the head.

Toxicology report: The 
official pathology report determined that the level of heroin in 
Cobain's bloodstream was 1.52 milligrams per liter - a potentially 
lethal dose.

However, 
private investigator Tom Grant - who worked for Courtney Love - has 
pointed out that meant Cobain could have been too high to even be able 
to pull the trigger.

Furthermore,
 Grant argues that the heroin was used to incapacitate Cobain 
before the shotgun was fired by the perpetrator of the homicide.

Suicide note:
 Grant claims that while he was working for Courtney Love he came across
 the suicide note that Cobain wrote for Courtney Love.

He
 believes that the letter reads as a note announcing he is leaving his
 wife and the music business - not as a farewell to life.

He claims the final few lines at the bottom - which do imply suicide - were added afterwards by an unknown individual.

The shotgun: The gun that the 
singer used to kill himself, a Remington Model 11 20 gauge, was not 
checked for fingerprints until May 6, 1994. According to the Fingerprint
 Analysis Report, four cards of latent prints were lifted but contained 
no legible prints.

Nick 
Broomfield: The filmmaker's controversial film, Kurt and 
Courtney made the claim that Courtney Love paid for a hit on her 
husband's life.

However,
 in  a 1998 interview, Broomfield said, 'I think that 
he committed suicide. I don't think that there's a smoking gun.'

Suicide:

Many of Cobain's friends and family have noted the singer's private and public utterances of depression and instability.

They noted his struggles with addiction and what they believe was an undiagnosed bipolar disorder.

They
 point to a previous suicide attempt in Rome in and bandmate's Krist 
Novoselic and Dave Grohl all believe he sadly took his own life.

'Our detective reviewed the case file anticipating questions surrounding the closed Cobain case as the 20 yr anniversary approaches,' another tweet explained. 

Detective Witt later told NBC News: 'There was nothing 
earth-shattering in any of these images.'

Speaking to KIRO on April 8, 1994, electrician Smith said that as he walked into the Nirvana legend's home  'I noticed something on the floor and I thought it was a mannequin.

'So I looked a little closer and geez, that's a person. I looked a little closer and I could see blood and an ear and a weapon laying on his chest.'

Stunned, he said that he could recall seeing the suspected suicide note ontop of soil in the home's greenhouse.

'I only read the bottom lines,' he said 'the bottom two lines said, 'I love you, I love you' to someone.'

Conspiracy theories: Kurt Cobain of and wife Courtney Love holding daughter Frances Bean Cobain - Nirvana fans have often tried to implicate Love in her husbands death - all these theories have been refuted by authorities

Legends: This 1991 file photo shows the band Nirvana, from left, Krist Novoselic, Dave Grohl, and Kurt Cobain. Nirvana will be inducted into the 2014 Rock and Roll Hall of Fame on April 10, 2014, at the Barclays Center in New York

Two weeks before his suicide, a police report detailed how officers had been called to his Seattle home after Cobain had locked himself in his bathroom and threatened to kill himself.

The report said that at the time, police were told 'he had a gun in the room.'

However, Cobain had told police he was not suicidal, but in the aftermath of his death they immediately ruled suicide.

More than 7,000 mourners packed Seattle Center two days later for a public memorial, where a recording was played of Love reading Cobain's suicide note.

Last year, a Seattle police department spokeswoman said the department gets at least one request per week to reopen the investigation, mostly through Twitter.

Police have said no other Seattle police case has received similar attention over two decades, reports KIRO.
