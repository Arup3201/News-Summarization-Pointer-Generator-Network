A contestant on the Wheel Of Fortune who ended up losing out on a $1 million prize after mispronouncing the correct answer says a mixture of nerves and adrenaline got the better of him.

Julian Batt, a freshman at Indiana University was given more than one opportunity to win large prizes including a one million dollar prize, and even a car, but he kept flouting his own Achilles heel.

In the now famous clip of a quiz show calamity, Mr Batt guessed the all letters to the answer 'The Mythological Hero Achilles' but instead of pronouncing it the proper way, he said 'A-chill-us' with a hard 'A'.

His answer was rejected by the show's rules and cost him the chance to win $1 million.

Julian Batt is thrilled at the opportunity to win $1 million and he even guesses all of the letters in an answer, but when it comes to reading the answers off the board, he unfortunately makes a memorable mistake

The 'Mythological Hero A-chill-us' answers Batt incorrectly and his poor pronunciation costs him $1 million

'Wheel of Fortune' rules dictate that contestants must use 'the generally accepted pronunciation' when trying to solve a puzzle.

'I
 didn't have a lot of time to really process,' he told the Indiana Star.
 'I was just going to say it how I thought it would sound. You have to 
stay positive. You have to keep the game going. And you can't let one 
buzzer discourage your performance for the rest of the game.'

After
 making a meal out of two further puzzles, newspapers and TV news shows 
called him the 'Worst Wheel Of Fortune Contestant Ever'.

Later on in the game, when Batt had the opportunity to win a car, all he had to do was guess the M and the N in the phrase 'The World's Fastest Man.' Yet again, he failed.

Then he had an opportunity to solve a puzzle once more. Instead of stating the correct answer as 'on the spot decision' he said it was 'on the spot dicespin'!

Next, the almost lucky contestant has the opportunity to win a car but unfortunately he fails to answer correctly again

Had Julian guessed the letter M and N, he would have won a car but unfortunately he guessed incorrectly

'Social
 media and the media, they're going to say what they're going to say,' 
Mr Batts said. 'They have their opinions. But at the end of the day, 
look at the end result. I won the show. I was the champion of the 
episode. Despite what happened in between, if you look at what happened,
 I still won.'

'It's the 
'Wheel of Fortune.' Crazy stuff happens all the time. It's a crazy 
game,' Mr Batts said. 'With those puzzles that I didn't solve, you have 
to keep moving forward. You don't have a lot of time to stop and mourn 
that you've lost the earnings that you could've won.

'I've
 realized as a student, that stuff happens on the spot. Stuff happens 
when you least expect it, and you have to be prepared to adapt and 
continue to look forward and not look back.'

Mr Batts took home $11,700, which he says will go towards a trip this summer to the Dominican Republic to study Spanish.
