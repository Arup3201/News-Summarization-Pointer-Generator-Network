When One Direction first appeared on television screens on the X Factor in 2010, they were hailed as the new clean-cut and fresh-faced British answer to Justin Bieber.  

Although the Harry Styles, Niall Horan. Liam Payne, Zayn Malik and Louis Tomlinson didn't win the talent show, they have gone on to become the franchise's most successful contestants of all time and been credited with making boybands popular again. 

They are now getting ready to release their fourth studio album - Four.

Niall Horan, Louis Tomlinson, Harry Styles, Liam Payne and Zayn Malik of X Factor's One Direction arrive for an autograph signing session at the HMV store, Bradford in December 2010. Since then, their style has changed dramatically, with their current looked modelled on the likes of Keith Richards, David Beckham and Mick Jagger

Their popularity means that they have become some of the wealthiest young men in the country - rumoured to have earned £45 million each last year. 

It has also meant that they are some of the most photographed human beings in the western world - barely a week goes by without their photographs splashed across the world's media. 

The band's bulging bank balance and worldwide stardom has seen a dramatic change in their image, going from shiny pop stars to cool rockers. 

Nearly all of the group are now covered in tattoos and Harry Styles and Zayn Malik in particular follow a fashion sense closely modelled on Keith Richards and Mick Jagger from The Rolling Stones. 

All of the boys are often seen front row at some of the biggest shows during Fashion Week and last year Harry won the Style award at the British Fashion Awards.  

Femail takes a look back at the group's style history from their formation to the current day:
