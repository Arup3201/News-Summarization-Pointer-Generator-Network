A father annoyed with his teenage daughter allegedly forced her to put on armour and fight him in a medieval-style duel until she collapsed.

Fremon Seay, 38, of Yelm, Washington, allegedly sat on top of the 16-year-old and whipped her after he took her home from a police station.

He then gave her Renaissance-style body armour, a shield and sword, and fought her for two hours until she could not stand anymore, police said.

Fighter: Fremon Seay was upset at his daughter and allegedly forced her to put on armour and fight him in a mediaeval-style duel until she collapsed

Seay found out she had gone to a party on Saturday without permission and ended up at a police station where he picked her up, police said.

Her allegedly told another one of his children to bring him willow stitches, before beating her on the bottom and legs, reported Seattle Weekly.

Seay then allegedly told his daughter to ‘put on your armour’ and they fought in the yard between 2am and 4am on Sunday morning.

‘During this, he's beating his daughter with wooden broadsword,’ a Thurston County Sheriff's Office spokesman told Seattle Weekly.

Severe bruising: Her father allegedly told another one of his children to bring him willow stitches, before beating her on the bottom and legs

all suffered extensive bruising.’

His 42-year-old wife, Julie Seay, was allegedly encouraging the fight to ‘beat the smirk off her face’.

The girl was allegedly then forced to strip down to her underwear when back inside and she had to watch a televised sermon from a preacher.

Detectives later received a 911 call from the girl’s friend, whom she had contacted with a text message in a desperate attempt to get help.

Mr Seay is charged with second-degree 
assault and has been arraigned. His wife was arrested and charged with 
being an accessory to a crime.

Renaissance fighting: The couple are in a group of enthusiasts who carry out 'live action role-playing' - also known as 'larping'

The girl was arrested herself on Saturday night before being picked up by her father at the police station - but it is not yet clear what for.

Their daughter is expected to recover although she is badly bruised. She and two other children at the home are staying with other relatives for now.

The couple are in a group of enthusiasts
who carry out ‘live action role-playing’ - also known in short as ‘larping’.

It 
usually involves a group of fighting people wearing the costumes of 
characters from a fantasy world or a previous age.

The red symbol on Seay's black tunic represents the 'Rolling Thunder household', which is part of the Society for Creative Anachronism (SCA).

The SCA is an international network of Middle Ages re-enactment groups.
