A New Zealand bride set up the perfect wedding day surprise for her groom when she ordered a helicopter to fly them up to one of the world's most scenic peaks, only moments after they were pronounced husband and wife.

Belinda, 27, and Campbell Stuart, 31, shared a once in a lifetime romantic experience as they spent their first moments as a married couple standing alone atop a mountain and looking down upon the lake of their hometown, Wanaka.

Meanwhile, Melbourne based destination wedding photographer Eric Ronald, snapped the beautiful moments from the chopper.

'It was amazing. It was pretty surreal really, we ended up there after getting married and I was pretty surprised I managed to pull it off,' Belinda told the Daily Mail Australia.

New Zealand bride, Belinda Stuart, set up the perfect wedding day surprise for her groom Campbell, when she ordered a helicopter to fly them up to a mountain peak above their home town, Wanaka

'It was an awesome experience to have our alone time up there, words can't really describe it. It was like out of a movie.'

The newlyweds had been together for eight and half years before they got married in February of this year, after Campbell proposed on a rainy day during a romantic weekend away.

Even when the helicopter arrived to the couple's wool shed wedding venue, where 125 guests were celebrating the big day, Campbell said he still had no idea what was in store for him.

'I thought someone had broken their leg and was being airlifted,' he said.

Campbell remained clueless until the last minute. He told the Daily Mail Australia that even when the helicopter arrived after they had been wed, he assumed someone had been injured and needed to be airlifted to safety

The duo admitted they had always dreamed of taking a helicopter ride on their wedding day, but as the costs of the wedding climbed they decided between them just to let the idea go

But Belinda changed her mind and booked the helicopter only six months away from the big date after she said she: 'woke up one day and thought "I will deffinetly regret it if I don't do it"'

'I was pretty stoked to be honest, I was pretty happy. It was incredible. It was the first time I'd been in one without injury. The last time I was in a helicopter, I was getting airlifted after a skiing accident when I fractured my tibiae.' 

The duo, who currently live in Melbourne but plan to move back to Wanaka, admitted they had always dreamed of taking a helicopter ride on their wedding day, but as the costs of the wedding climbed they decided between them just to let the idea go.

'But I woke up one day and thought I will definitely regret it if I don't do it,' Belinda said.

'I kept it a secret, as I thought Campbell would talk me out of it, and I only organised it about six months before the actual wedding. It was worth every cent. It was a pretty magical experience.

Belinda and Campbell's wedding took place in a wool barn in New Zealand which 125 guests attended. The duo met through a mutual friend and moved to Melbourne, but plan to relocate back to their hometown

The big surprise came close to being ruined on a number of occasions, according to Belinda, who said she phoned the helicopter company four times on the day of the wedding due to being worried about the windy weather

'Campbell doesn't know how much it costs, I think it was about $12,000 or so, because we took the whole bridal party up there which was about 10 of us in total.'  

The big surprise also came close to being ruined on a number of occasions, according to Belinda, who said there were some close calls.

'It was really windy, so didn't think it would go ahead and I phoned them about four times on the wedding day,' she said. 'They were late, but we waited and they turned up about 5pm.'

'I tried to keep it a secret from everyone, only one of my brothers knew.'

'It was an awesome experience to have our alone time up there, words can't really describe it. It was like out of a movie,' Belinda said
