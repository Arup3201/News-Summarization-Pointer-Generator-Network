Brolin has some downtime right now giving him plenty of opportunity to indulge his passion for surfing.

He recently wrapped filming on two movies: the adventure drama Everest with Robin Wright, Jake Gyllenhaal and Keira Knightley, and the Coen brothers comedy Hail, Caesar! with Scarlett Johansson and Channing Tatum.

The son of actor James Brolin, who's married to Barbra Streisand, he recently started dating Kathryn Boyd.

Boyd was  worked as his assistant at his production company in Santa Monica from February 2013 to March 2014, when she left the job after they became romantically involved.

The true Grit star and his second wife, actress Diane Lane, were divorced in 2014 after nine years of marriage.

Boyd, who's believed to be in her mid to late twenties, graduated with a degree in journalism and magazines from the University of Georgia in 2009.

According to her LinkedIn profile, she got a job in August 2011 as Ben Stiller's set assistant on The Watch, a movie he shot with Vince Vaughn in Atlanta.

In February 2014, one month after finishing her gig with Stiller, Boyd joined Brolin Productions as an executive assistant.
