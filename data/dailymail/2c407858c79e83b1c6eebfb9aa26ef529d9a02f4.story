A 52-year-old Michigan man convicted of the shooting murder of his sister and her husband in a crime of incestuous passion went on a one-hour rant about God and his innocence before being sentenced to two life sentences on Monday.

Ryan Wyngarden rambled on about how he had been framed by police over the 1987 slayings, saying he will soon be 'vindicated' by the Lord and even called the judge a liar.

But his protestations were not enough to convince the jury - who found him guilty of two counts of first-degree murder - or Ottawa County Circuit Judge Jon Hulsing, who said Wyngarden was a controlling, calculated killer before handing down the dual prison terms without the possibility of parole.

'You are a brutal, cold-blooded murderer,' Judge Husling said, according to M Live.

Ryan Wyngarden cries during his appearance at Ottawa County Circuit Court in Grand Haven, Mich., while making a statement before his sentencing on Monday, April 21, 2014. He was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole for the 1987 killings of Gail and Rick Brink, his sister and brother-in-law

Ryan Wyngarden went on a rambling one-hour rant at his sentencing hearing in  last-ditch effort to show his innocence

'You put two bullets in the face of your brother-in-law.

'This was a brutal execution. This was a brutal homicide.'

Wyngarden shot and killed his sister Gail Brink and her husband Rick on November 21, 1987, with a .22-caliber revolver at the couple's rural Ransom Street home north of Holland.

Rick Brink was shot while in his truck. His wife was shot while in bed.

Prosecutors cited Wyngarden's sexual history with his sister as motivation for the murders.

They said he was worried his sister would tell her husband about their teenage sexual encounters.

The case remained cold for over a decade until detectives convinced Wyngarden's wife Pam to testify against her husband, telling the story about how he had tearfully confessed to her.

At a hearing last year, Pam recounted the moment Wyngarden allegedly told her he had carried out the murders, just three months after they first started dating.

Case reopened: The Brink murders were a cold case for many years until Wyngarden's wife came forward, and told authorities that her husband confessed to the crimes

'He was upset and crying,' she told the court. 'And I asked, "What's wrong?" and he said, "I shot and killed Rick and Gail". I asked if he had called the police, and he said no.'

When she asked him why he had killed them, 'he said the reason he shot them was he didn't want Rick to find out the intimate relationship between him and Gail and that he was jealous', she said.

But in court this week, Wyngarden tried to convince the jury that those sexually-related incidents wouldn't have provided a motive for killing his sister.

In his testimony, Wyngarden admitted to having three sexual experiences with Gail, but denied the two ever had intercourse.

The first instance happened when Wyngarden was 12 and his sister was nine.

He said they were naked and 'just playing around...comparing body parts' when their mom came into the room.

'There was nothing sexual about it,' he said.

The next time the two had a sexual encounter was one or two years later when the siblings were smoking marijuana.

'We just groped on each other a little bit. There was no clothing that ever came off. That was pretty much that,' he said.

The final instance happened when Wyngarden was 15 and again involved marijuana.Wyngarden described the encounter as 'consensual' and says the two touched genitals but it didn't escalate to sex.

'My sister did not lose her virginity to me,' he said.

'I wouldn't have killed my sister over this.'

Having to talk about the sexual encounters caused Wyngarden to become antagonistic with the prosecutor, constantly talking out of turn.

At one point the judge had to order the jury out of the court room so he could warn Wyngarden not to talk over the prosecutor.

'Mr. Wyngarden, you can’t argue with me,' the judge said. 'This isn’t going to end well for you with the jury.'

It was also revealed in court this week that Wyngarden tried to convince his wife Pam not to testify in the trial after he was arrested for the murders last year.

He sent 29 letters to Pam in the span of six months while he was in jail waiting for arrival, sometimes threatening her with God's spite.

'I am beyond belief that Pam sticks to this lie, but I truly believe God's light will bring the truth' he wrote in one letter.

Wyngarden's defense argued that the Brinks were victims in a case of a mistaken identity.

The couple had recently moved into a home vacated by residents who had links to the narcotics trade and connections to a Detroit-area biker game.

Wyngarden suffered emotional highs and lows throughout the sentencing, crying at points and flaring up at others.

At one point he quoted from the Bible, then said in a loud voice: 'Lord, I didn’t do this. You know I didn't do this. I just told the truth. I didn't kill my sister and you know it.'

'So, here I am, an innocent man, shackled … for no reason other than what Repper and Blakely suggested (to his wife).'

He talked about the night his daughter, 'my little angel sent down from heaven', was conceived.

He urged his children to be 'good citizens, don't cheat, lie, steal, be a good neighbor, be quick to forgive'.

At several points, he wept.

'Innocent man, stripped of your family, stripped of your wife, because of a bunch of lies,' he said.

Wyngarden's tirade only cemented opinions that he committed the killings, Assistant Ottawa County Prosecutor Lee Fisher said.

'He's definitely not in touch with reality,' he said.

The conviction helps both families, he said.

'I think it means closure, and justice was done.

'They don't have to wonder anymore what happened to their brother and Gail.'
