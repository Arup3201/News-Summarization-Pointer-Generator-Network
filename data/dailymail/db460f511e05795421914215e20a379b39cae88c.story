Head of the IFS Paul Johnson warned health spending could not be protected

NHS funding could have to be cut after the election following George Osborne’s move to rule out further tax rises, it was warned today.

Ring fence protection for the health service and pensions will come under ‘additional pressure’ after 2015, the Institute for Fiscal Studies said.

The Chancellor drew the battle lines for the 2015 campaign yesterday, insisting that he can get the deficit under control with spending cuts alone.

Under Mr Osborne’s austerity plans, a further £23billion of savings must be found in 2016 and 2017.

But questioned by MPs on the Treasury Select Committee, he insisted: ‘I’m clear that tax increases are not required to achieve this. This can be achieved through spending reductions.’

Mr Osborne went further when he 
addressed a lunch of Westminster journalists, saying that he is 
advocating a ‘100 per cent spending mix’.

However the IFS said that the decision would mean a further £6 billion being slashed from public spending - leaving budgets for many areas of Government spending one-third lower than they were when the coalition came to power in 2010.

IFS director Paul Johnson added that Mr Osborne’s pledge would break his previous rule of thumb that 80 per cent of the deficit-reduction programme should be funded by cuts and 20 per cent by tax hikes.

And he made clear that it would become increasingly difficult for the Government to maintain the so-called ‘ringfence’ protecting areas like the NHS, schools, overseas aid and pensions from cuts.

This week NHS England warned the health service would face a £30billion black hole by 2021 without fundamental change to the way services are offered.

Mr Johnson told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ‘One of the difficulties that governments are in at the moment is that if you ringfence health and pensions - and obviously you can't do anything about what you are spending on debt interest - that's a very, very large chunk of spending that is just out of the picture.

‘Therefore, everything else - if you are going to do it all through spending - has to be cut a lot.

‘If you are going to do it all through spending that does put additional pressure on the ringfence.’

Shortfall: After the 2015 election big savings will have to be made, which could need taxes to rise by £6bilion to Institute for Fiscal Studies said

Mr Johnson cautioned that it would be unusual for Mr Osborne to forswear tax hikes altogether in the wake of the election.

‘Chancellors don't tend to warn the electorate before elections that they are going to raise taxes or not,’ he pointed out.

‘The position whoever wins the next election is going to face is a really big additional consolidation, either further big spending cuts or some tax increases.

‘The choice that is open is to continue with spending cuts such that a whole range of bits of public spending will end up being one-third lower than they were in 2010, or to do some of it through tax increases.

‘In previous post-election budgets - think of 2010, 2001, 1992 - all of those post-election budgets have seen tax rises.

‘Six billion pounds would be the sort of level of tax increase you would want in order to keep to the 80/20 spending-tax rule that he sort of set for himself back in 2010.

‘Coincidentally, it's also the average increase in taxes we've seen after each election over the last 30 years.’

Pledge: Chancellor George Osborne said there was no need for more tax rises

However Mr Osborne has made clear that it is possible to find the money from more cuts instead increasing taxes.

Tory ministers have already suggested 
they will look at banning under-25s from claiming housing benefit and 
limiting child benefit payments to the first two children.

‘We’ve just demonstrated that we can 
deliver £11.5billion of spending cuts in the spending round,’ Mr Osborne
said.

‘This can be delivered through spending savings, both in welfare 
and in departments and there is no need for tax rises to contribute to 
that consolidation.’

He told the Treasury Committee: ‘I don’t think we have reached the end-point in reforming welfare.’

His bullish approach comes as the 
outlook for the economy is improving.

Mr Osborne claimed that 
‘opposition to what I am doing in the economy is crumbling’ after Labour
agreed to accept departmental spending limits he has set in 2016 and 
2017.
