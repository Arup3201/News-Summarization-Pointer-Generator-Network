A planned two-day strike by Lufthansa pilots is threatening to create more chaos for holidaymakers and business travellers.

German pilots’ union VC is calling a strike for Monday and Tuesday after talks broke down over retirement benefits.

It is the ninth time this year that Lufthansa pilots have staged a walkout.

The VC union said the Germany-wide strike would last from midday on Monday to 11:59pm on Tuesday for short- and medium-haul flights, as well as from early morning to late evening on Tuesday for long-haul flights.

Pilots flying for Lufthansa Cargo will also strike on Tuesday. Flights operated by budget arm Germanwings are not affected.

Cologne-based Lufthansa has not said how many flights are expected to be cancelled during the strike.

A similar walkout in October affected more than 200,000 travellers as the carrier was forced to cancel hundreds of flights, including dozens between destinations in the UK and Germany.

Lufthansa and its pilots are at odds over proposed changes to an early retirement scheme that was developed decades ago.

The airline said the latest strike is completely disproportionate and called for an immediate resumption of talks.

It said it made concessions in recent talks, including a five per cent pay rise, but reiterated that it would not accept a demand that new pilots, as well as those already with the company, should be able to retire at 55.

The ongoing dispute has been costly for Lufthansa.

Eight previous walkouts by staff this year wiped more than £125m off the carrier's operating profit, adding to pressure from a stuttering global economy and increased competition.

Lufthansa plans to use other pilots from within the group who are not on expensive collective labour agreements to staff tourist routes, where the brand, which usually focuses on business travellers, is trying to reduce costs.

Passenger transport in Germany has also been disrupted by train drivers' strikes this year.
