As the 70th anniversary of D-Day approaches one woman will be remembering the hero father she never met.

Lieutenant Den Brotheridge was the first Allied soldier to be killed in action on June 6, 1944, which marked the beginning of the end of the Second World War.

Back home his wife Margaret was eight months pregnant with their daughter, also to be called Margaret with the baby being born two weeks after his death.

On Friday Margaret, now 69 from Honiton in Devon, will be among the millions commemorating the anniversary of D-Day, where more than 10,000 allied troops died.

Mr Brotheridge was 29 when he boarded a glider across the English Channel and then gathered his men on a beach after crash landing.

He then led the charge to clear enemy trenches at the Caen canal ridge but was hit in the neck during an exchange of fire.

But his platoon still managed to capture two key bridges, with the Caen Canal Bridge later being named the Pegasus Bridge, after the emblem of the British airbourne forces.

His daughter Margaret always knew that her father died but didn't realise the extent of his heroics and bravery until she was in her early 30s

Ms Botheridge always knew that her father had died but it wasn't until she was in her 30s that she realised her father's bravery.

In 1994 she visited his grave in Ranville in France and again this week she will be making the trip across the Channel to the cemetery.

She told the Sunday Mirror: 'I'm so proud of my father, not just for his heroism but because he was a normal person. He was proud of his group of men and he led them from the front. He was one of them.

'I would have loved to have known my father. I'm so proud of what he did.'

Also travelling to France for the commemorations is D-Day veteran Patrick Churchill, a member of a Centaur Tank that landed on the beaches that day.

Patrick Churchill, a D-Day veteran will also be making his way to Normandy for the 70th anniversary commemorations

The 90-year-old returned to Normandy 10 years ago for the 60th anniversary of D-Day, where he was presented with the Legion D'Honneur, France's highest honour.

Mr Churchill of Witney in Oxfordshire, who was serving with Number 4 Commando said: 'It does take you back and it takes me back to the time I saw these bodies.

'I learned later on what these were. Apparently the glider troops were going in just after Pegasus Bridge and the cable broke and they all went into the sea.

'Hitting the beach there were some dead Germans and I thought goodness gracious me - I was just thinking of their parents somewhere, that that could be me, and it might be me, and what would they think, and how would they feel?'

'History is the mainstay, you've only got to look through - it's something people should take more seriously because you will get these despots coming into power because of the ignorance of the people under them. That is what it is.'

The landings were a turning point in the war, leading to the liberation of occupied Europe

Heads of states from 17 nations, including the Queen will also gather for an international ceremony in Normandy next week

Heads of states from 17 nations, including the Queen will also gather for an international ceremony in Normandy next week which will take place at the Sword Beach.

For many veterans, now in their late 80s and 90s, who have made the annual pilgrimage to honour the 156,000 Allied troops, this year's events will be their last to the scene of their exploits.

Also due to attend Sword Beach will be US president Barack Obama and also German chancellor Angela Merkel, in a sign of the harmony and friendship rebuilt since the horrors of the war.

The day before the main international ceremony, the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh will travel to France for a three-day state visit, and will be received by French president Francois Hollande.

On Thursday, Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall will meet veterans, including from the Glider Pilot Regiment, the Parachute Regiment and the Queen's Own Rifles of Canada.

The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge will also play a role by attending events in Arromanches on Friday.

Allied troops land on the Normandy beaches during D-Day on June 6, 1944, marking a major turning point in the Second World War

On June 6, 1944, Allied forces, led by General Dwight D. Eisenhower, stormed the beaches of Normandy, France, on 'D-Day', beginning the liberation of German-occupied Western Europe during World War II.

The Normandy landings, codenamed Operation Neptune, were the beginning of Operation Overlord, the Allies' assault on German-occupied territory.

The mission was the largest amphibious invasion in history with over 160,000 soldiers, including 73,000 Americans, 61,715 British and 21,400 Canadians, involved and over 5,000 ships.

There was an initial airborne assault with 24,000 troops being parachuted into France before the sea landings began at dawn.

The Normandy coast was split into five sectors for the attack - Juno, Sword, Gold, Omaha and Utah.

The timing of the operation was crucial, with commanders needing the right weather, a full moon and the correct tidal conditions.

On D-Day alone, around 4,400 Allied troops died with a further 9,000 wounded or missing. Total German casualties are estimated at between 4,000 and 9,000.

The landings were a turning point in the war, opening up a second front - the Russians were already advancing on Germany from the east - and leading to the liberation of occupied Europe.

'The tide has turned. The free men of the world are marching together to victory!' Eisenhower said in an historic address after the invasion was launched.
