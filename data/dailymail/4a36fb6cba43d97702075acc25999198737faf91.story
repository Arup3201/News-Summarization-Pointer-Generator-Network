A passport found in the wreckage of the estate car named the dead man as Ali Al Manasfi, 22, from West London

A Briton suspected of fighting with jihadists in Syria was killed yesterday after his car was riddled with bullets by government troops.

A passport found in the wreckage of the estate car named the dead man as Ali Al Manasfi, 22, from West London.

He is said to have been among 200 Britons who went to Syria to fight with rebel forces against President Bashar al-Assad.’ 

An American woman and another 
unidentified Western man, thought to be Canadian, also died in the 
shooting in Idlib province, north-west Syria, a major flashpoint in the 
two-year civil war.

Rifles, clips of ammunition, grenades
 and the flag of Al-Nusra – an offshoot of Al Qaeda – were reported to 
have been found in the vehicle, which was attacked by Assad’s forces.

Rebel commander Mona Mahmood said they died after his soldiers exchanged fire with Shabiha forces, a militia loyal to Assad.

The three, who were said to have been
 photographing Syrian army positions, were killed trying to return to 
his forces.

He added: ‘They made a mistake, they wanted to avoid the 
centre of Idlib and instead took a back route through the suburbs.

‘But they didn’t know there was a Syrian army checkpoint.

‘The army shot up their car and the British guy was killed.’

Syrian TV showed bullet holes covering the windscreen and one of the doors of the black VW Golf.

Images of what appeared to be 
Manasfi’s body lying beside the car and that of another man with a short
 beard were also shown. Last night his family said that at first they 
had not known he was in Syria and had reported his disappearance to 
police three months ago.

His brother-in-law Kusai Noah said they only discovered where Manasfi was when he called two weeks ago.

Mr Noah added: ‘He had strong 
feelings about what was happening. He saw it on TV. Everyone  has strong
 feelings, even if they are not Syrian, to see individuals killed every 
day, children and women, for no reason.’

Mr Noah, who is married to Manasfi’s 
sister, Bushra, said: ‘When he called his mother he said he wanted to 
get married and have children there. But we did not believe him.

‘It was a very dangerous place to go.
 His family is from Syria although he was born in England and lived all 
his life in London.’

The Foreign Office was last night 
trying to piece together what happened and looking into whether Manasfi 
was involved with the hardline Al-Nusra Front, blamed for some of the 
worst atrocities of the war.

Anti-terror officials said the 
killings highlighted fears that many of the Britons believed to be 
fighting with terror groups in Syria could return to the UK to continue 
jihad having had firearms and bomb-making training.

Around 80 Britons have returned to the UK from Syria, with some monitored by MI5 and Scotland Yard.

The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said Manasfi and his two 
colleagues had been ambushed and it was unclear whether they were 
fighting with moderates or jihadists.

However, reports in the US named the 
dead woman as Nicole Mansfield, 33, a mother of one from Flint, 
Michigan, who had converted to Islam and was said to be part of 
Al-Nusra.

Her aunt, Monica Mansfield Speelman, said: ‘I didn’t think she was a terrorist, but God only knows.
