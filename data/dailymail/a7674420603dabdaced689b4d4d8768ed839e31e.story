It's official, Spanish giants Real Madrid are the only side in Europe's major leagues to have found the back of the net in every single league game this season.

Top flight sides from England, France, Italy, Germany and even other Spanish sides have all tried and failed to match Carlo Ancelotti's Madrid.

Premier League leaders Chelsea came closest to matching the Spanish side's incredible achievement by scoring in all but one of their league games this season.

Jose Mourinho can blame Sunderland for tarnishing their perfect record after the Black Cats held the west London outfit to a goalless draw at the Stadium of Light.

Chelsea had 66 per cent possession that day and had 24 shots on goal without finding the back of net against a stubborn Sunderland side.

As have Portuguese duo Benfica and Sporting Lisbon who currently occupy first and third in the Primeira Liga.

But it's Real Madrid's incredible wealth of attacking players that hog the limelight yet again.

Carlo Ancelotti's side have scored an average of 3.4 goals per game and also hold the record for most goals scored away from home this season.

The league leaders have scored 68 La Liga goals in total this season with 37 of them coming away from the Santiago Bernabeu Stadium.

Their biggest win of the season was the 8-2 thrashing of Deportivo La Coruna at the Estadio Riazor.

Former Premier League trio Cristiano Ronaldo, Gareth Bale and Javier Hernandez scored seven of the eight goals between them that day with Colombian ace James Rodriguez bagging the other.

La Liga top scorer Ronaldo has scored 28 goals for the club this season in just 20 games - six more than Ballon d'Or rival Lionel Messi and 13 more than Neymar.
