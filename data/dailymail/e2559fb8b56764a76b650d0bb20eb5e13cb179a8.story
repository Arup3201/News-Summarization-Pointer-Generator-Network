Smart car technology is expanding faster than the industry knows how to protect it, leaving gaps for hackers to exploit, a recent survey of major automakers revealed.

The report, produced by Senator Ed Markey, found most major auto manufacturers are clueless about how to stop malicious attackers from exploiting expanding technology to steal data or take control of vehicles remotely.

'Drivers have come to rely on these new technologies, but unfortunately the automakers haven’t done their part to protect us from cyber-attacks or privacy invasions,' the senator said in a statement.

Warning: Senator Ed Markey released a report that showed most automakers were unable or unwilling to secure computer systems and data in their cars

'Even as we are more connected than ever in our cars and trucks, our technology systems and data security remain largely unprotected.'

Researchers have known about electronic security flaws  for years. For example, one report in 2011 from the University of California and the University of Washington detailed how vehicles' electronic systems could be vulnerable to the many of the same types of intrusions as computers.

Yet Markey's report shows the auto industry as a whole still lacks the consistent capability to secure vehicles' systems and protect against even moderately determined attackers. 

For the report, the senator's office sent letters to 20 major auto manufacturers back in 2013, including Ford, General Motors, Toyota and Volkswagen.

The letters asked questions about the known vulnerabilities in vehicle systems, past attempts to hack vehicles, existing security measures and how data was collected and secured.

The report claims that among the manufacturers that responded, 11 said that their entire fleet had allowed wireless access to the vehicle and 3 said a majority of their cars did.

While the entry points make vehicle diagnostics monitoring possible, they also present possible gateways for intruders.

When asked by Senator Markey how they secure these entry points, the report says that many manufacturers 'did not seem to understand the questions posed.' 

The report also found that in the event that your car is taken over by electronic intruders, don't expect the automakers to be much help.

Only two manufacturers could describe steps it would take to respond to the attack that could credibly minimize the damage hackers could inflict.

The report also found that many automakers collect huge amounts of data - everything from tire pressure to the last place the car was parked.

Half of the manufacturers surveyed by the senator's office also stated they collected and wirelessly transmit data from vehicles, though the few that said they secured the data gave 'vague' responses about encryption or passwords.

Underscoring Markey's report are vulnerabilities exposed by researchers backed by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, or DARPA.

With a laptop, computer scientists found they could take control of a car once they had access to systems such as OnStar.

60 Minutes showed attackers gaining access to a Chevrolet Impala, activating the horn and wipers before deactivating the braking system and forcing the driver to crash into a set of cones.

Markey's report notes that as more wireless access, including vehicle-to-vehicle communication, emerges, manufacturers will need to respond.

'As vehicles continue to become more integrated with wireless technology, there are more avenues through which a hacker could introduce malicious code,' the report states. 'And more avenues through which a driver’s basic right to privacy could be compromised.'

'These threats demonstrate the need for robust vehicle security policies to ensure the safety and privacy of our nation’s drivers.'
