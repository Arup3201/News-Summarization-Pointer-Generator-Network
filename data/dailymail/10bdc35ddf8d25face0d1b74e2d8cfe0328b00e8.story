Beanie Babies creator Ty Warner has been charged today with federal tax evasion after allegedly failing to report income earned in a secret offshore bank account.

The businessman behind the stuffed toy animal craze in the 1990s has agreed to pay a penalty of more than $53 million.

As Chicago prosecutors announced the charge against Mr Warner, his defense lawyer issued a statement saying the 69-year-old billionaire intended to plead guilty and pay the massive penalty.

Charges: Ty Warner, the man behind the Beanie Baby craze, allegedly failed to report income in an offshore bank account

Mr Warner, who lives in suburban Chicago and is the sole owner of TY Inc., still faces the prospect of time behind bars. A conviction on a federal tax evasion charge carries a maximum five-yearÂ  sentence.

The 69-year-old, said by Forbes to have a $2.6 billion net worth, was behind the Beanie Babies craze that made the company hundreds of millions of dollars in the mid-90s.

The small, plush toys come in various animal forms with heart-shaped name tags and were considered valuable collectors' items.

His most valuable investment however, is said to be New York's Four Seasons Hotel. He turned down a $900 million offer to buy it in November last year.

Court documents allege that Mr Warner maintained a secret offshore account starting in 1996 with the Switzerland-based financial services company, UBS.

His attorney, Gregory Scandaglia, said Mr Warner accepts full responsibility.

'This is an unfortunate situation that Mr Warner has been trying to resolve for several years now,' Mr Scandaglia said.

A release from the U.S. Attorney's Office in Chicago did not mention a $53 million penalty. Mr Scandaglia described it as 'a civil penalty ... for failure to file a Foreign Bank Account Report'.

According to prosecutors, Mr Warner earned $3.1 million in gross income in 2002 through investments held in the UBS account.

He allegedly committed tax evasion by failing to inform his accountants about that income. By leaving out his UBS income, he falsely reported that his total income in 2002 was $49 million, prosecutors said.

'Regardless of wealth, everyone must pay taxes on all of their income, not just the amount they choose to report,' Gary S. Shapiro, the acting U.S. attorney in Chicago, said in a statement.

A date for Mr Warner's arraignment has not yet been set.
