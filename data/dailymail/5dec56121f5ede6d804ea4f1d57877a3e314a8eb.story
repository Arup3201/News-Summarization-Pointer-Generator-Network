Professor Les Ebdon said they should admit undergraduates according to ¿academic potential¿

A university watchdog has told campuses to help poorer pupils win more places by looking beyond would-be students’ qualifications when recruiting.

Professor Les Ebdon said they should admit undergraduates according to ‘academic potential’ rather than simply totting up their GCSEs and A-levels.

The head of the Office for Fair Access (Offa) also revealed he had intervened at 26 universities to insist they make targets for recruiting poorer pupils more ambitious.

He said the most privileged fifth of pupils were eight times more likely to be offered a place at a leading university than the most disadvantaged fifth.

Professor Ebdon added: ‘Fair access is about searching out academic potential wherever it is – in every type of neighbourhood, every type of school and every age group, ethnic group and gender.

‘It’s about acknowledging that a wide range of people have the potential to become the excellent graduates who will later run our businesses and lead our country – not just the privileged few.’

Labour will siphon public funding from elite universities towards those providing vocational education, it will announce today.

Ed Miliband wants to introduce ‘technical degrees’ and will put universities that offer them on the priority list for expansion.

The Labour leader believes the degrees will help the ‘forgotten 50 per cent’ who do not go to university.
