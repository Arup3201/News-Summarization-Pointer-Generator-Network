Hero: Gareth Bellingham died after going to the rescue of an injured Afghan civilian

A hero soldier was shot dead as he went to the rescue of an Afghan civilian injured by a land mine.

Private Gareth Bellingham died in a hail of bullets after being ambushed by insurgents in Afghanistan’s Helmand Province.

The 22-year-old had heroically broken cover to help aid the stricken civilian injured by an explosive device on June 18 - but was fatally hit in the neck.

An inquest on Tuesday into Pte Bellingham's death heard how the soldier - who was serving with the 3 Mercian 
(Staffords) - was on a patrol providing protection for a meeting between
his commanding officer and local nationals.

His role was to clear a path for the patrol using a metal detector to find improvised explosive devices (IEDs).

But when a civilian was injured by an IED outside of the patrol zone, Pte Bellingham was sent to clear a path to the man.

Captain Matthew Hickmott, who was in charge of the unit, said: 'He moved from his position, but he hadn’t gone very far when there was small arms fire.

'Our unit returned fire, and I radioed base and gave them as much information as possible.

'There was at least two of them firing at us. One with a machine gun and one with an automatic rifle.

'I shouted three times to Pte Bellingham but he did not respond. I went towards him and he was completely unresponsive.'

As the fire fight continued around him, Cpt Hickmott administered first aid to Pte Bellingham, before being relieved by the unit’s medic.

Once the fight was over, Pte Bellingham’s colleagues carried him to a point where he could be transported back to his base.

Cpt Hickmott added: 'It’s a testament to Gareth’s character how hard everyone worked to save him, including the Afghan National Army, and even some local nationals.

'I hadn’t known Pte Bellingham very well before deployment, but we had built quite a close working relationship.

'He
had developed a reputation for being an excellent operator of the metal
detector. He had set the record for the number of sweeps he could do in
a short space of time.'

Following the inquest yesterday, Pte Bellingham’s dad, Leslie, paid tribute to his son.

The
50-year-old, also from Clayton, Stoke-on-Trent, said: 'Gareth’s death 
has left a void in our lives, but I would like people to remember him as
a proud, upstanding soldier.

'We already knew how the Afghans had worked hard to save him, but hearing it in evidence brought it home.'

North Staffordshire coroner Ian Smith ruled Pte Bellingham, from Clayton, Stoke-on-Trent, Staffs, was unlawfully killed.
