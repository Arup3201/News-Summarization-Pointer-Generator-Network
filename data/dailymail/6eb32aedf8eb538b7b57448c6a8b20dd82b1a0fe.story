George Osborne today sought to bring some pre-election cheer with cuts to the taxes on beer, cider and whisky.

The Chancellor boasted more pubs would be saved from closure with the promise of a penny off a pint of beer for the third year in a row.

And as he cancelled a scheduled rise in fuel duty, meaning it will cost £10 less to fill up a car than it would have under Labour's plans.

Chancellor George Osborne, pictured in a pub in February last year, boasted more pubs would be saved with the promise of a penny off a pint of beer for the third year in a row

The Budget cut the price of beer duty by 1p alongside a 2 per cent cut to cider duty 'to support our producers in the West Country and elsewhere'.

He also announced that 'to back one of the UK's biggest exports, the duty on Scotch whisky and other spirits will be cut by 2 per cent as well'.

Duties on tobacco and gaming are unchanged and wine duty is frozen.

Mr Osborne said: 'Last year, I cut beer duty for the second year in a row and the industry estimates that helped create 16,000 jobs.

'Today I am cutting beer duty for the third year in a row – taking another penny off a pint.

'I am cutting cider duty by 2 per cent - to support our producers in the West Country and elsewhere.

'And to back one of the UK's biggest exports, the duty on Scotch whisky and other spirits will be cut by 2 per cent as well. Wine duty will be frozen.

'More pubs saved, jobs created, families supported – and a penny off a pint for the third year in a row.' 

Camra (the Campaign for Real Ale) said it was 'delighted' with the hat-trick of cuts, adding it would be welcomed by millions of beer-drinkers across the country

Chief executive Tim Page said: 'The last two cuts have already had a huge impact, saving over 1,000 pubs from closure and keeping the price of a pub pint down.

'Independent research by the Centre for Economic and Business Research forecasts that the price of a pub pint will now be more than 20p cheaper than it would have been had the beer duty escalator remained in place.' 

A planned rise in fuel duty was also cancelled by the Chancellor, in good news for motorists

Scotch Whisky Association chief executive David Frost said: 'This is a historic decision and only the fourth time whisky duty has been cut in a century.

'The Chancellor's announcement will be toasted across the whisky industry and by consumers who are getting a fairer deal on tax when they have a drink of Scotch. The move is a major boost to our industry as we look to grow again in the UK, and equally sends out an important signal on fair taxation to our export markets.

'The industry is raising a glass to George Osborne and his Treasury team, as well as to all those who have supported our campaign over the last two decades.'

Wine and Spirit Trade Association chief executive Miles Beale said: 'We are delighted that the Government has listened to consumers and taken action to address the UK's excessive spirit duty rates. This small drop in duty will result in a big cheer for the UK's 24 million spirit consumers.' 

But Alcohol Concern said the Government had 'once again cast aside the health of the nation to protect the interests of "big alcohol" '.

Mr Osborne also pleased motorists by extending the freeze on fuel duty as well as announcing a round-the-regions package of transport improvements.

Fuel duty has been frozen for four years. Today Mr Osborne said he was carrying on the no-rise policy by scrapping the planned September increase, which would have added 0.54p a litre to prices at the pumps.

Mr Osborne said: 'Petrol frozen again. It's the longest duty freeze in over twenty years. It saves a family around £10 every time they fill up their car. Ten pounds off a tank with the Tories.' 

The RAC Foundation said the continued freeze was 'very welcome' while the AA said the announcement 'allows the coalition to dodge the fuel-protest bullet'.
