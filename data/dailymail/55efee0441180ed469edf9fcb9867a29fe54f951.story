The Tupperware Party marketing strategy of the 1970s has proved its longevity time and time again.

Every retailer from Ann Summers to the Body Shop successfully send representatives round to people's houses who invite their friends to come over, enjoy a convivial evening - and of course, shop the latest products from the brand's range (preferably, the brands no doubt think, with their credit cards well-oiled by a glass or two of chardonnay).

And now one entrepreneur from London is taking the concept to the next level by launching Mani Parties, an opportunity to get the girls together, learn about the hottest new nail trends from catwalk to celebrity, and get advice on how to recreate the looks at home.

Elizabeth van der Lande, 26, from north London is the founder and owner of online nail boutique de Mains. She started her company only last year and now launches the next stage of her business - the de Mani Party.

A de Mani Party is a bespoke nail 
soirée that caters to guests' wishes - from tuition on creating a 
distinct look to providing inspiration for stand-out nails - at home.

'We're really excited to 
be bringing de Mains to people through de Mani Parties,' says Elizabeth.

'They're
a really easy way to try out the latest colour and nail art trends and 
we will show you how to do them yourself!  Hosts will earn commission on
any purchases their guests make on the night. 

'A de Mani Party is perfect for a girls' night in, or for the start of a girls' night out.

'We use only products at de Mani 
Parties that are available on the de Mains website - brands including 
Cetuem, Essie, NCLA and Seche. The relationships we have with our brands are well-established and the brands do not have anything to do with the parties.

'At this stage de Mani Parties are only available in London, but we hope to grow this to other regions, should there be appetite for parties. 

'There are freelance technicians that perform nail treatments at clients' home, but de Mains is unique in offering parties of this nature - as an extension of the website.'

'I run de Mains from my kitchen table 
in the evenings and at weekends. I have a day job in a boutique finance to
keep my company afloat.

'De Mains was born out of a long love of nails 
and the realisation that after three years out of university I was not in a job 
that fundamentally interested me. I was in PR at the time and wanted to 
do something with my life that I enjoyed and that allowed me to be creative
and that was for me.

'The idea came to me about 18 months ago in 
December 2011 and the de Mains website launched in July 
2012.

'I do manis on family and friends. I'm always on hand after dinner 
parties to do a quick mani or two, and it's how de Mani Parties started.
What I love most about de Mains and nails is receiving photos sent by 
friends of their nails who have been inspired by my nail work. I haven't
done any celebrity nails yet, but who knows in the future.'

We've got a feeling the de Mains Mani Parties will be a hit with girls getting ready for a big night on the town or getting the bridesmaids round the night before a bride's wedding day.
