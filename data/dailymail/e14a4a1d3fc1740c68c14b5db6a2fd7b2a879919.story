A tonne of deadly asbestos has been found dumped on an Adelaide beach.

The building material was found submerged in piles of corrugated roofing material and dumped in bags on the beach on Thursday night.

CFMEU SA secretary Dave Kirner said he was tipped off about the waste at Pelican Point, northwest of Adelaide, by an environmental group. 

'There's about a tonne of asbestos in three piles,' he told ABC radio on Friday.

'In our view it was probably a commercial contract job and they've gone and made a bigger profit on the job by going and dumping this asbestos.'

CFMEU state secretary Dave Kirner says he found more than a tonne of asbestos dumped at the beach

The beach is a popular spot for quad bikers who may have driven over the asbestos, Mr Kirner says.

'When I was there, there was a family there with a five-year-old kid,' he said.

'There's community interaction all around the asbestos, so we want to get it stopped straight away.'

'Asbestos contractors are worried that people are entering the industry and not operating properly,' Mr Kirner told Adelaide Now. 

'It had been dumped off a really big truck or skip... it had been packed up properly.' 

The Environment Protection Authority has sent an emergency response team to the site to take samples of the asbestos

Individuals caught dumping waste can be jailed for a maximum of two years or fined up to $120,000
