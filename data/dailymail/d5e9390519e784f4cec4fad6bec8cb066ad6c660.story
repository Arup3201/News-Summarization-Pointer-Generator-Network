He is one of the finest players to grace the European stage, deciding countless matches with his flawless passing and unforgettable goals.

With Milan, Andrea Pirlo twice lifted the European Cup - first in 2003 after they beat Juventus on penalties at Old Trafford and again in 2007 when they defeated Liverpool 2-1 in Athens.

And when the Italian master's time with Internazionale and Juventus is included, he has played in a total of 130 European matches.

So the 35-year-old legend is certainly well placed to select his Champions League dream team. Here's his selections.

GOALKEEPER

Gianluigi Buffon

The veteran Italian goalkeeper and Pirlo’s team-mate at Juventus is certainly no stranger to European football, having played 124 Champions League and UEFA Cup games during his long and distinguished career.

Pirlo’s verdict: ‘He has been at the top for so long. He makes saves that no other goalkeeper in the world can make. He knows how to command the defence and give confidence to them.’

DEFENCE 

Philipp Lahm

The full back has been an integral part of the Bayern Munich side that has dominated German football in the last few years and also enjoyed plenty of success in Europe too. Bayern won the Champions League in 2013, beating Borussia Dortmund in the Wembley final, and were also runners-up, to Inter Milan in 2010 and Chelsea in 2012.

Pirlo’s verdict: ‘One of those players who never makes mistakes, always so reliable for Germany and Bayern. Probably doesn’t always get the credit, because it's just so normal for him to be playing at such a high level now.’

Paolo Maldini

A giant of the European game and master of the defensive art, Maldini won 26 trophies during his glittering 24-year career with Milan. The former Italy player made a colossal 161 European appearances for the club, lifting the European Cup on five occasions (1989, 1990, 1994, 2003 and 2007). He also reached another three finals in Europe’s grandest competition (1993, 1995 and 2005).

Pirlo’s verdict: ‘A defender who could read the game like nobody else, so intelligent and always so calm on the ball. One of the true greats, for both Italy and Milan.’

Fabio Cannavaro

Another great exponent of the Italian philosophy on defending, Cannavaro played in Europe for Napoli, Parma, Inter, Juventus and Real Madrid, clocking up more than 100 games on the continental stage. He won 136 caps for Italy and was instrumental in their 2006 World Cup triumph.

Pirlo’s verdict: ‘A true leader that didn’t need to ask for respect, but naturally got it. Without doubt one of the best central defenders to have ever played.’

Cafu

A man who brought Brazilian flair to the art of defending, Cafu was as bold going forward in attack as he was in the tackle at the back. His long and illustrious career received its crowning glory when he lifted the European Cup with Milan in 2007.

Pirlo’s verdict: ‘Trend-setting in being one of the first truly great attacking full backs. Excellent at getting forward, but very strong defensively as well.’

MIDFIELD 

Paul Scholes

With his flawless passing and crunching challenges, Scholes excelled on the European stage with Manchester United. He twice got his hands on the European Cup  - although he was suspended for the 1999 final before playing his part in the win over Chelsea in Moscow in 2008.

Pirlo’s verdict: ‘The truly great English midfield player of the generation. Didn’t just play the game, he thought about the game. You could see every pass, every decision, was based on his intelligence and understanding.'

Gennaro Gattuso

The ultimate shield for a defence, Gattuso was powerful, energetic and committed in every game in which he played. With Milan, he twice lifted the European Cup, in 2003 and 2007.

Pirlo’s verdict: ‘Rino is the opposition’s nightmare. Even in a training game, he plays like it is the World Cup final. The style of his game allows his team-mates time on the ball. Every team needs a Gattuso.’

Xavi

Spanish hero and midfield passing perfectionist who continues to be outstanding for Barcelona and has achieved everything in the game. This includes winning the Champions League on three occasions (2006, 2009 and 2011).

Pirlo’s verdict: ‘Another intelligent midfield player. Didn’t need to spend the whole time running but would control so many games for Barcelona and Spain with his intelligence and range of passing.’

ATTACK 

Kaka

Brazilian superstar who, at the peak of his powers in the mid-to-late noughties was arguably the best in the world. Played in 94 European matches in his two spells with Milan and four seasons at Real Madrid and won the Champions League with the Italian side in 2007.

Pirlo’s verdict: ‘I remember how badly we took it as a team when Kaka left Milan. For two or three years he was the best player in the world. There was a point when teams just had no idea how to stop him.’

Lionel Messi

Without question one of the greatest players to ever grace the game, Messi has achieved so much for his 27 years. This includes three European Cups with Barcelona – against Arsenal in 2006, and Manchester United in both 2009 and 2011. He is the all-time leading scorer in the competition and has an incredible 75 goals in 94 matches.

Pirlo’s verdict: ‘Has achieved so much, but still I am sure will achieve so much more. I don’t need to talk in detail about what he is capable of. Everybody knows he is one of the greatest ever already.’

Fillipo Inzaghi

One of the deadliest strikers to emerge from Italy, Inzaghi scored 70 goals in 114 European matches for Parma, Juventus and Milan. The present manager of Milan, Inzaghi also won the Champions League twice (in 2003 and 2007).

Pirlo’s verdict: ‘Just the perfect goal scorer. We had this most incredible understanding. We did not even have to look for each other. He knew what pass I would make and I knew where he would be. You gave him a chance and he would take it.’
