Texas A&M quarterback Johnny Manziel was pictured partying in a Dallas club on Saturday, the night after he and his teammates won big in the Cotton Bowl tournament.

Part of the spectacle surrounding his Heismen trophy win came from the fact that he was the first freshman football player ever to win the coveted prize, but now his age is the reason for his currently problem.

The athlete, who goes by the nickname 'Johnny Football', is 20-years-old and does not reach the legal age of 21 until December.Â

Photos of Manziel partying with friends at Avenu Lounge appeared on social media sites, including an Instagram picture posted by the club's DJ.

Dallas-based DJ Avi posted a picture of himself with Manziel at Avenu last night, captioning it: 'it's a party'.

In the picture, Manziel is holding an open bottle of what appears to be Dom Perignon champagne.

The same is true in other photos obtained by TMZ, which show the 20-year-old pumping his fists in the air while holding the pricey champagne. The lighting shows that between a third and a half of the bottle had already been consumed.

He clearly was in a celebratory mood, as he danced around with friends and held a lit sparkler in his mouth.

Even if he argues that he was not drinking the champagne, that is not the only problem wrong with the picture.

Avenu is a 21-and-over club, so both he and the establishment could face legal drama.

This isn't the first time that Manziel's age caused him problems, as he was arrested in College Station, Texas previously for using a fake ID and allegedly participating in a fight, leading to two misdemeanor charges.

Saturday appears to have been a bit more tame, however, as The Dallas Morning News reported that Manziel started his celebration off by having dinner in the private room at famed local steakhouse Al Biernat's.

Though he was only there with a few 
friends and teammates, crowds started forming and the entrance to the 
private room had to be manned to ensure that the football star was 
uninterrupted.

The reason for all of this celebration comes as he led his team to a 41-13 victory over Oklahoma in the Cotton Bowl on Friday.

Now all eyes- including Manziel's- 
turn to Florida, however, as Notre Dame and Alabama prepare to face off 
in the BCS National Championship Monday night. He tweeted on Sunday that he is headed to Miami to go watch the game in person.
