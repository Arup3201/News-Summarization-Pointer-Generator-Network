Almost 3,000 attempts to enter Britain are made each month by illegal immigrants, figures released by the Home Office have revealed.

The number, which has almost quadrupled in just three years, does not take into account those who made it into Britain undetected.

From April to July this year, 11,920 attempts were made to enter the UK.

Attempts: Almost 100 immigrants have been trying to enter Britain illegally every day, statistics reveal

Each day, almost 100 illegal immigrants try to enter Britain, the statistics released following a freedom of information request sent by The Daily Telegraph newspaper reveal.

If current rates continue, by the end of the year, there could have been more than 35,000 attempts by immigrants to sneak into Britain.

That would be a huge increase on previous years. In the year April 2013 to April 2014, 19,000 attempts were made, in 2012/13 it was 11,731, and in 2011/12 the figure was 9,632.

On Wednesday, John Vine, the chief inspector of borders and immigration said in his final report that the Home Office was still failing to ‘get the basics right’ on immigration.

The report added that it was ‘frustrating and disappointing’ to encounter the same problems ‘over and over again’, he added.

Lord Green of Deddington, the chairman of Migration Watch told The Telegraph: ‘The sharp rise in the number of clandestines might reflect more effective detection but an increase on this scale is more likely to be due to increased pressure on our borders.

‘Part of that may be due to deteriorating conditions in the Middle East and Africa, but there is little doubt that the freedom of our society, the existence of a black market in labour and the presence of relatives and friends add up to making the UK a very attractive destination.’

The figures come after lorry drivers were warned not to stop in a 130 miles radius of Calais to avoid illegal immigrants hiding in their vehicles.

More than 2,500 are thought to be currently living in shanty towns around Calais in the hope that they may be able enter Britain.

James Brokenshire, the Immigration and Security minister said: ‘We continue to strengthen the security of our borders to stop those who have no right to enter the UK.

‘Using some of the best technology in the world, our officers prevented more than 18,000 attempts to cross the Channel illegally in the year to April 2014 – a rise of more than 60 per cent on the previous year.’
