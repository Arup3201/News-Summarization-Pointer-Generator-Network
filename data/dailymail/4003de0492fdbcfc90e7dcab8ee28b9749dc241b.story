The owner of a filthy bakery has been fined after inspectors discovered mouse droppings, out of date meat, and grime caked on to the floors inside.

Loose rodent bait was found in the flour store, mould was seen growing on the ceiling, and a hole in the roof had been given a 'bodge job' repair - with a bucket used to catch the drips.

Richard Broad, one of the directors of The Upper Crust bakery in Norwich, said standards began slipping after the business ran into money troubles when a Tesco and Greggs opened nearby.

Neglected: Paperwork had also been filled out saying areas had been cleaned when they were in fact filthy (left) while loose rat bait and droppings were found in the flour store (right)

Health inspectors first noticed problems at the shop, which supplies the University of East Anglia’s Sportspark complex, the Coach and Horses pub and the Fat Cat inn, in 2013.

The owners were given time to clean up their act, but when nothing had improved on a return inspection they were hauled into court.

Prosecutor David Lowens told Norwich Magistrates' Court that health inspectors had noticed 'very quickly' that the bakery was in an 'extremely serious' state.

Out of date ham was found on sale, worktops were dirty and documents had been incorrectly filled out saying areas had been cleaned when this was not the case.

James Landals defended the firm, saying its decline after chain stores opened up nearby was 'a sad story'.

He said the business, which used to employ three part-time staff and have two directors, has now gone out of business and the company is in the process of being wrapped up.

Downhill: Director Richard Broad said the business became neglected after it ran into financial troubles when a Greggs and Tesco Express opened nearby

One of the directors, Richard Broad, was brought to court, and said the responsibility for hygiene had rested on former director Peter Whitlam.

However he admitted the firm 'should have kept a closer eye on things', and entered guilty pleas to six charges of violating health and safety standards.

Malcolm Bird, chairman of the bench, fined the firm, which closed its doors on December 31 last year, just £200 and £20 costs due to its limited funds.

Mr Bird said: 'If we had been dealing with the company trading under normal circumstances, this would be completely different.'
