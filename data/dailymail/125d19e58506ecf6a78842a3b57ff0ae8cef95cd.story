Ladies, forget your mini-skirts and throw away your elegant evening gowns. A new trend is sweeping the upper classes — men’s military jackets.

And who is pioneering this masculine look? Step forward at the double the Duchess of Cambridge’s shapely sister Pippa.

According to vintage clothes shop owner George Cazenove, Pippa, 29, has bought herself a 60-year-old cavalry officer’s tunic from his newly opened men’s boutique An Officer And A Gentleman in Hungerford, Berkshire.

Pippa channels the rocker look, left, at the 
Aegon Queen's Club tennis tournament in June, while looking feminine in 
2011 at her sister Kate's wedding to Prince William - but how will she 
look in her military jacket?

George, former owner of the lively Piccadilly gentleman’s outfitters Bertie Wooster, whose past clients include Catherine Zeta-Jones and Yasmin Le Bon, tells me: ‘Pippa browsed for 20 minutes before finding this 17th/21st Lancers’ jacket — it was blue with gold buttons and dated from the Fifties.

'She looked absolutely amazing in it, though it did cover her famous bottom. 

‘I find it incredible that though I specialise in men’s clothing, so many of my clients are women.

‘They seem to have worked out how lovely they look in small sizes of men’s military frockcoats.’

And how much did Pippa’s new outfit cost?

‘It was a bargain at £65,’ says George.
