Two mothers have discovered that caterpillars are partial to a bit of corn after finding bugs inside their food.

Suna Canatar discovered what she thought was a maggot in a tin of sweetcorn she bought from a shop in Lewisham, South London, while Mandy Mason found one on a frozen corn on the cob.

Mrs Canatar, 50, said her hair 'stood on end' after finding the bug in a tin of Princes sweetcorn she bought from a branch of 99p Stores.

Mandy Mason says she will be checking her food more thoroughly after discovering a caterpillar in a frozen corn on the cob

Suna Canatar has been put off sweetcorn for life after discovering the caterpillar inside a tin

Caterpillars are naturally found in the wild in places like cornfields

She said she has been put off the canned vegetable for life.

'It was as big as my finger,' she said. 'I was so shocked I couldn't do anything. It has put me off sweetcorn for life.

A spokesman for Princes pointed out that caterpillars are found naturally in the wild in places such as sweetcorn fields.

Mrs Canatar added: 'The light was quite dim and I didn't really think anything of it. I thought it might be a stick or something.

'I poked it with my finger. All my hair stood on end. I put my glasses on and put the light on and I thought "no this is some kind of worm or something".'

Meanwhile, Mrs Mason, from Swanage, Dorset, says she spotted a black mark on a frozen corn on the cob she served up with steak and chips.

Mrs Canatar said her hair was left standing on its end after she discovered the inch-long bug

Iceland gave Mrs Mason a £10 gift voucher for the distress she suffered

On closer inspection she saw that it was a dead caterpillar that had stuck to the food despite being frozen and then boiled.

Iceland has offered a £10 gift voucher to Mrs Mason and apologised for the distress caused.

She said: I just thought it was a black bit of corn that had gone off to start with, as you can find that on some vegetables.

'But then I took a closer look and started to pull it out and just thought "what's that?" I then realised it was a worm or a caterpillar.

'I was shocked. If I didn't check it would have been put on someone's plate, I don't normally inspect food like that but I will be doing it from now on.
