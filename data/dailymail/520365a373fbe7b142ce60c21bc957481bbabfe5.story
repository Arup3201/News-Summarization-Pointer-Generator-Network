Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink’s reign as Burton Albion manager started perfectly with a 3-1 win at fellow League Two promotion candidates Wycombe.

The Dutchman’s appointment as successor to Gary Rowett raised a few eyebrows but this victory and the performance that delivered it will encourage all at the Pirelli Stadium.

On the evidence of this impressive win at Adams Park, delivered thanks to goals from Phil Edwards, Alex MacDonald and Jacob Blyth, they can definitely mount an assault on the automatic promotion places.

With just a few days to find his feet at the Staffordshire club and get to know his squad, this was as good a performance as Hasselbaink could have wished for and a foundation stone upon which to build.

It was not the most auspicious of starts. The Burton team coach was stuck in traffic on its journey down to Adams Park and arrived a little later than scheduled, though Hasselbaink, looking dapper in dark suit and club tie, was still all smiles for the waiting Sky Sports cameras upon arrival.

It seemed the Brewers’ socks had gone missing, or somehow clashed, and so they stepped out in a mismatched ensemble of yellow shirts, black shorts and light blue socks borrowed from their hosts.

And to complete Hasselbaink’s initiation into League Two football, his team booted the ball straight out from the kick-off. Things could only improve.

The small knot of 87 travelling fans from Burton gave the new manager their full and vocal backing from the outset, singing his name in repetition to a booming drum beat for the first 10 minutes.

Hasselbaink has inherited a strong team from Rowett, who jumped ship to Championship Birmingham City late last month, and Burton sat fifth in the standings after the weekend’s action.

Wycombe, meanwhile, have enjoyed a real renaissance after last season’s relegation dogfight and Gareth Ainsworth’s men had the opportunity to leapfrog Luton and Shrewsbury and return to the summit with three points.

Unsurprisingly it was they who set the tempo in the opening stages and captain Paul Hayes directed a Hogan Ephraim cross from the right narrowly wide with his knee.

As Wycombe continued to press, Hasselbaink moved from his seat on the bench to stand, cross-armed, in his technical area, occasionally pointing a finger and bellowing an instruction.

The Chairboys continued to push forward - Alfie Mawson took a nice touch but could only fire over before Matt Bloomfield’s cross was flicked on initially by the impressive Ephraim and then wide by Hayes.

So it was firmly against the run of play that Burton took the lead on 38 minutes. If Hasselbaink goes on to achieve at Burton this will be remembered as the first goal of his epoch and a decent one it was too.

Matty Palmer swung in a corner and there was Edwards arriving right on cue to thump home a header. Hasselbaink responded coolly with a brief round of applause. The fans were again singing his name as the whistle went for half-time and he responded with an appreciative wave.

It got even better shortly after the break with a second goal out of the Dutch football school. Palmer split the Wycombe defence with a diagonal through ball and MacDonald slotted the ball through the keeper’s legs.

Things were all going a bit too well and Wycombe halved the deficit on 65 minutes when Ephraim was fouled inside the box. Hayes smashed home the penalty and the momentum looked as though it was about to shift, especially when Ephraim headed over when well placed.

Nothing changed. Three minutes later, Damien McCrory swung in a ball from the left and Blyth, only just introduced from the bench, rose highest to head home and restore Burton’s two-goal cushion.

Hayes saw a goal disallowed for offside before Blyth almost added his second from a Palmer cross but goalkeeper Matt Ingram scooped the ball away.

There was plenty of excitement around the former Premier League star trying his hand in the lower leagues

A lengthy injury stoppage, which saw Wycombe’s Mawson hobble off, led to 11 minutes of stoppage time but Burton weren’t unduly troubled again and Hasselbaink celebrated with a beaming smile and a wave to his family in the stands.

Speaking on Sky Sports, Hasselbaink said: 'It was a really good group performance. We were solid in a lot of aspects of the game, at times we passed it well.

'I will try to get as much knowledge as possible [about League Two] and see as many games as possible, get to know the players. I knew a fair bit but it's always good to get to know more. There will be many night when I'll be in the stands watching.

'We'll take the confidence from this and we have another difficult one next week - Luton at home. It's a different game, a battle and the boys will be up for it.'
