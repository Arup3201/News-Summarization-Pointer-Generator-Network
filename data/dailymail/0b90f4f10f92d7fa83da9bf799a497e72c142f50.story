Theresa Murphy, 29, who has been given a three year sentence for the brutal glassing of her neighbour

A female 'thug' who blinded her neighbour after throwing a glass at her head following a row over loud music at a garden party has been jailed.

Theresa Murphy, who was drunk at the time, 
took offence at the request and threw the glass she was holding at her 
victim's face, causing her horrific facial injuries.

Murphy, 29, from Birmingham, launched an attack after her victim asked her to turn the music down at the party, which took place yards from the filming site of Channel 4's Benefits Street.

She was sentenced to three years in jail Â for grievous bodily harm at Birmingham Crown Court.

Murphy was arrested after her assault as she tried to flee the scene in Lodge road in Winson Green by hailing a taxi.

Birmingham Crown Court heard the unnamed 55-year-old victim was rushed to hospital following the brutal attack.

Despite emergency medical attention, doctors were unable to save the sight in her left eye, and she was left blind.

Instead, doctors were forced to remove her left eye completely, and amid her recovery she will have to undergo skin grafts to repair some of the scarring on her face.

Murphy was jailed for three years for the crime, after pleading guilty to inflicting grievous bodily harm on her victim.

Speaking after the case Detective Constable Chris Smith, from West Midlands Police said: 'The injured woman was taken to hospital where medics were unable to save the sight in her left eye and had to remove it completely.

'After several painful operations, her ordeal is still not over and she has yet to undergo a skin graft to repair scars on her face where the glass hit her.

'The attack had a devastating effect on the woman and I welcome the sentence.'
