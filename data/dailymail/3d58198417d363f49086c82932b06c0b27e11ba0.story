A family home has been reduced to rubble in a huge explosion, just three days after residents of the same street were told the gas they could smell was 'nothing to worry about'.

Miraculously no one was killed in the explosion on Argyle Street, Stoke-on-Trent on Tuesday afternoon.

Two people suffered minor injuries and a pregnant neighbour was taken to hospital but was later released unharmed.

Rubble: The remains of the house after the explosion ripped through it on Tuesday afternoon

Mystery: The National Grid maintain there's still no evidence of a gas leak - even after the explosion

Fire crews from Hanley and Longton, the Urban Search and Rescue Unit from Greater Manchester and a team from West Midlands Fire and Rescue Service attended the incident.

Initially work was halted because the building was so unstable and it was not safe to proceed. About three hours after the explosion, two sniffer dogs searched the scene but did not discover any casualties.

The force of the blast was so strong, emergency crews evacuated nine homes on the same street, fearing the shock could cause them to collapse too.

Resident Derek Callear, 65, said: 'I was walking down the street and suddenly I saw the whole house go up in the air.

'There was a huge cloud of smoke and rubble flying out, and I saw a man lying on the ground.

'Two people were sitting in the van parked directly outside the house; they are really lucky to be alive.'

Affected: Neighbours the Qamers and the Domagalas live near to the scene of the explosion and have been left without gas or electricity

Miraculous: Emergency crews searched the rubble but found no bodies or casualties

A number of worried homeowners had called out engineers to Argyle Street on Saturday to search for the source of a strong gas smell.

But they were reassured there was no sign of a leak.

Mr Callear added: 'People have been reporting the smell of gas in this street for about a week.

'I called the national grid, and I know at least three of my neighbours had too, but they didnâ€™t find anything wrong.'

Another neighbour, Marie Ashton, 72, said: 'I heard this huge bang and at first I thought my washing machine had exploded.

'I went outside and everything was covered in dust.'

Incredibly, tests carried out after the explosion still show no sign of a leak.

A National Grid spokesman said: 'We are carrying out checks on our network but no gas has escaped in the immediate area.'

The mystery has left officers at Staffordshire Police scratching their heads.

Detective Inspector Steve Morrey, said: 'This type of incident is very rare. Detectives are currently investigating circumstances leading to the explosion.'
