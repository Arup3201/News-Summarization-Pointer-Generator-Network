Manchester United's £60million record signing Angel di Maria has been excellent since he arrived from Real Madrid. He is a real star. However, Louis van Gaal will have to find a way to get him more involved in games when his side don’t dominate play. He was quiet on Sunday— as he was against Chelsea last weekend — and didn’t give his full-back Luke Shaw too much help either. The goal came from Yaya Toure’s pass with Di Maria just watching.

Beware the goat, Gary 

Former United defender and now Sky TV pundit Gary Neville spent some time on the touchline catching up with members of his old club’s backroom staff before kick-off but then ran into an old adversary in the form of City legend Shaun Goater. Is it really almost 12 years since Neville gifted ‘The Goat’ the famous goal in City’s 3-1 win in the last ever Maine Road derby?

Etihad atmosphere flat before KO 

Jose Mourinho caused some ripples this weekend with his comments about the lack of atmosphere at Stamford Bridge, and it must be said it wasn’t great before kick-off here either. The situation is not helped by the pre-match entertainment put on by City outside the ground. It’s great for fans but means they don’t enter the ground until the last minute and can’t build the tension ahead of a big game.

Slim pickings at centre back 

Injury prevented City’s marquee summer signing Eliaquim Mangala from competing for a place in the centre of defence, but the Frenchman has not looked entirely comfortable in the Premier League. Interestingly, United scouted him extensively last season only to conclude he was too prone to errors. Unlike Chris Smalling...
