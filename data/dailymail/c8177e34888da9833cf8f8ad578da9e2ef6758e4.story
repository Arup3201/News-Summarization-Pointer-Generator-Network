The nephew of a convicted serial killer revealed his terrifying intentions in chilling poems he wrote before murdering a teenager 20 years after his uncle's crimes.

Matthew Milat, 19, told 17-year-old David Auchterlonie he was just 'doing what my family does', before brutally beheading him in Belanglo Forest, south of Sydney.

Milat's uncle Ivan had killed seven backpackers in the forest in April 1992, including British women Joanne Walters and Caroline Clarke, both 22.

His nephew's troubled state of mind was clear from the poems, which included phrases such as 'I am not fazed by blood and screams', which he wrote before the sickening attack.

Another contains the line: 'Clouds roll over in light blue skies/ Like darkness in a killer's eyes.'

Milat hovered over David with an axe for ten minutes before the murder, telling him, 'You move, I chop your head off.'

Milat and Cohen Klein, also 19, are now facing a sentencing submission hearing in the New South Supreme Court after pleading guilty at an earlier hearing to murdering David.

The court was told David's family remained 'terrified' at the knowledge of how he died at the hands of Ivan Milat's relative.

Matthew Milat, the 19-year-old nephew of notorious serial killer Ivan, composed several ominous poems before his brutal murder of 17-year-old David Auchterlonie.

In one of the twisted verses, read out during today's hearing, he wrote:

'Lifeless corpse, Motionless and drained,

Another street has been blood stained,

heart and soul I do not own,

and there is no place I can call home,

What sort of life do I lead,

the kind that keeps me on the streets,

Kill for cash, Is what I do,

call me up I'll work for you,

I am not fazed by blood or screams,

Nothing I do will haunt my dreams,

Maybe they might scare you,

Coldblooded (sic) killer, that's me, Not you.'

Another poem is written in rap style and entitled, Your Last Day.

David's father, also David, told Acting Justice Jane Mathews that his son 'received a life sentence, but it's a curse for those of us left behind', Sydney's Daily Telegraph reported.

In a poignant moment, he said that he had wanted to kiss his son goodbye when he saw his body but he was a court exhibit now.

The teenager's mother, Debbie Locke, said she often wears her son's jackets and hooded tops to feel close to him.

In court documents seen by The Telegraph, Milat said that in committing murder he was just 'doing what my family does'.

As he walked towards the forest with his victim and Klein, he said, 'we're going to Belanglo. Someone's going to die.'

The court was told that the murder and 15 minutes of dialogue were captured on Klein's mobile phone.

David's grandmother, Sandra, told the court after she saw him in the mortuary, 'I can still see the fear impaled on his face.'

During today's hearing, parts of a 15-minute audio recording of the murder were played - after the judge invited the family of the victim to leave if it was going to be too distressing for them.

Milat is heard telling David he had 'dobbed him in' for stealing, before adding: 'You move, I chop your head off. I warned you that I was a bit of a f***in' nut lately.'

David was forced to lie face down in the dirt and can be heard repeatedly denying doing anything to Milat.

Then the recording plays what a transcript describes as the 'sound of axe hitting Auchterlonie in the head.'

The sentencing hearing continues.

Ivan Milat, now 68, is serving seven consecutive life sentences and will never be released from his maximum security jail south-west of Sydney. Australia's worst serial killer, Milat came to be known as the Backpacker Murderer.

His victims were kidnapped and shot or stabbed to death, with one young woman, from Germany, being decapitated.

Miss Clarke, from Northumberland, had been shot several times in the head while Miss Walters, fromÂ  south Wales, had been stabbed nine times. The Britons' bodies were found in the forest in September of the same year.

No other bodies were found at the time, but a year later a local man discovered a skull. Police returned to the forest and found five more bodies of backpackers who had been murdered in previous years.

Milat had also killed a German backpacking couple, a German woman who was hitchhiking alone, and two young travellers from Melbourne.

He was arrested after British backpacker Paul Onions managed to escape and give police details of his attacker.
