Naughty or nice, beware: the Elf on the Shelf is always watching to report back to Santa what kids around the world are up to in the lead-up to Christmas.

And for the unbelievers, here's definite proof that the cheerful scout elves—who hide while children are awake— get around the house when nobody is watching. 

SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO 

Here's to the unbelievers: a couple of children are confronted with 'proof' that their Elf on the Shelf really does move when they go to bed

The kids giggle as they see stunning footage of the elf flying over their bed while they slept

The mischievous elf pauses to wink at the camera as he heads out on his way back to the North Pole

Surveillance footage shows the little Elves on the Shelf running around Christmas trees, messing with presents and even jumping on beds. 

In one of the videos, mom Bobby Wilson tells her two kids how she installed a nanny cam in their bedroom to see if their elf would do anything once everyone went to bed. 

'Last night, when y'all fell asleep, we set up the camera to see if we could catch Elf flying around the house and see if he'd do something,' she tells her young son and daughter in a YouTube video.

'And guess what, we caught him — on camera, flying around the house!,' she tells them, as the stunned kids listening in incredulously. 

Here's yet another Elf on the Shelf pretending to be just another household decoration

But once everyone goes out, he starts to run around the house before heading back to the North Pole to report on the family  and whether they've been naughty or nice

While Wilson's children slept, her camera caught the elf jumping up and down their bed and flying around the room. 

Other elves have been caught on surveillance footage running up and down stairs, changing family portraits and even messing with presents. 

The North Pole did not immediately respond to call from DailyMail.com seeking comment.

This elf is not only mischievous, he's also a bit of a narcissist. Here he is caught changing pictures of his host family for some of his own

He flies straight into the picture frame as he gets ready to exchange a third picture of the family for one of his
