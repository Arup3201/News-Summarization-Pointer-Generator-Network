A multi-millionaire who believes California should be separated into six separate states has been granted permission to collect petition signatures calling for his plan to be put to the vote.

Venture capitalist Tim Draper, 55, says the Golden state is too large to govern efficiently, and that people living there would be better served by a more localised government.

The technology investor has proposed splitting the state into six: San Diego and Orange County would become South California, Los Angeles and Santa Barbara would make up West California, the Sacramento area would be known as North California, and Bakersfield, Fresno and Stockton would make up Central California.

Proposals: Venture capitalist Tim Draper, 55, believes California should be separated into six separate states to enable the region to be governed more effectively

Silicon Valley would be made up of San Francisco and San Jose, while Redding and Eureka would form Jefferson.

More than 38 million people call California home, making it the most populous state in the US, and if it was to be its own country it would boast the world's eighth largest economy.

California is also the third largest state by area, taking in almost 164,000 square miles of coastline, mountain ranges, several huge cities such as Los Angeles and San Diego, and desert.

Were his plan to be implemented Mr Draper, who
 made his name, and some of his fortune, investing in Skype and Hotmail,
 would find himself living in the Silicon Valley state as he lives in 
Atherton - located between San Francisco and San Jose, and ranked number
 two on Forbes magazine's most expensive zip codes.

Scheme: Mr Draper has been granted permission to collect petition signatures calling for his plan to separate California into six to be put to the vote

Campaign: Mr Draper, who made his name investing in companies such as Hotmail and Skype has set up a website to promote his scheme

In
 December Mr Draper filed a ballot initiative calling for the changes, 
saying that social and economic changes across the state has left it 
difficult to govern by the state's capital Sacramento.

'It is more and 
more difficult for Sacramento to keep up with the social issues from the
 various regions of California,' he told ABC News.

'With six Californias, people will be 
closer to their state governments, and states can get a refresh.'

However, critics of the scheme have 
raised concerns about changes to issues such as agricultural policies 
and the voting system, as well as how the state's assets, and problems, 
would be shared out.

Urban: The state is home to several huge cities, including Los Angeles which has a population of 3.85million

Diverse: California covers almost 164,000 square miles - from densely populated cities to the desert, such as Death Valley

Secretary
 of State of California Debra Bowen has now allowed him to start 
collecting the signatures he would need to put his plan to a ballot when
 Californians vote in November 2016, when the next Presidential election
 will be held.

He would 
need to find 807,615 registered voters to back his proposals before July
 18 - having been given a deadline of 150 days to submit the signatures 
to county elections officials. The figure is 10per cent of the total 
votes cast for governor in the 2010 election.

'If the federal government approves the proposed creation of six new states, all tax collections and spending by the existing State of California would end, with its assets and liabilities divided among the new states,' Ms Bowen said in a statement on her official website.

'Decisions by appointed commissioners and elected leaders would determine how taxes, public spending, and other public policies would change for the new states and their local governments.'

If California did vote for the change, it would then be up to the US 
Congress to authorise the new states' inclusion into the union.
