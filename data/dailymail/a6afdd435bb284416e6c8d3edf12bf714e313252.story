Cheryl Burke, the former Dancing with the Stars professional, is set to choreograph the man who became a global internet sensation after being mocked for his dance moves, Daily Mail Online can reveal.

Burke will teach the man, identified only as Sean from London, some dance moves ahead of a 'party of a lifetime' which has been planned in his honor following an online campaign to track him down. 

The epic party will be thrown at Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, which has a capacity of 93,000 people, later this year.

The list of superstar performers who have offered their services keeps getting bigger. Pharrell Williams, Moby, Ellie Goulding, Andrew W.K., DJ Tommie Sunshine and dance duo Knife Party have all lent their support to Sean known affectionately as Dancing Man. 

Professional dancer Burke, who competed on ABC's Dancing with the Stars for 18 seasons, tweeted: '@DancingManFound heard ur amazing story! Would love to dance w/u & give dance tips.'

The star, who announced her departure from the prime time dance show in December last year, will make sure Sean can wow the crowds when he takes center stage at the event, which is expected to attract thousands of revelers. 

Cassandra Fairbanks, who spearheaded the #finddancingman campaign and is organizing the party, told Daily Mail Online that Sean is 'very excited'. 

'We have some big surprises for Sean, we're gonna make sure he has the time of his life,' she said. 

'He will definitely be making an appearance on stage and Cheryl from Dancing with the Stars has reached out and offered to choreograph him which will be amazing. 

'There's also a lot of big names who have offered to perform, the thing is out of control, it just keeps getting bigger and bigger.' 

Fairbanks' campaign began when she saw Sean pictured in a photo on the 4chan site looking down in the dumps after apparently being made fun of. 

An anonymous poster wrote: 'Spotted this specimen trying to dance the other week. He stopped when he saw us laughing.' 

The post was republished on photo site imgur and quickly picked up more than 2000 comments of support for the mystery man's moves. 

A GoFundMe account — intended to track down Sean and offer to fly him to L.A. - is at $38,000 and climbing. 

Organizers of that page say any money that doesn't go do the dance party will go to an anti-bullying campaign. 

Fairbanks said the original fat-shaming taunts about Sean were 'disgusting bullying', but she said he is now basking in internet love. 

'There have been thousands and thousands of messages – it's just been an outpouring of support and love and kindness. 

'Sean has been been amazing. He says he's been smiling and laughing all day and reading everybody's messages.' 

Fairbanks, 29, who is originally from Boston, Massachusetts, says she herself has been 'overwhelmed' by the flood of attention and isn't sure how many people will attend the party. 

Outraged: The post was later screenshot and posted on Imgur , where it attracted the attention of thousands of social media users, including Cassandra Fairbanks (above), who said she was 'horrified' by its 'cruel' nature

Offer: Cheryl Burke will help the party atmosphere by tutoring Sean in his moves

Success! After launching a Twitter campaign, The Free Thought Project activist manage to locate Sean within hours. Above, Sean posted a photo of himself holding up a sign reading: 'Hi Cass & Twitter (as requested!)'

Formal invite: On Thursday night, the hashtag #finddancingman went viral. Ms Fairbanks's group even issued a formal, blue-colored invitation to the dance party to Sean. Part of it read: 'We want to see you dance freely'

It's him! At around the same time, Ms Fairbanks received a photo of a man who looked like the Dancing Man - and was wearing the same wristband - posing next to the team mascot of London soccer club Arsenal

'It's been a whirlwind, I'm having trouble keeping up,' she said. 'It's gone a little bit crazy, there's a lot of people who want to get involved. 

'It's really hard to say how many people are coming because I feel really swamped. 

'Right now I have over 15,000 messages that I haven't been able to respond to. My email inbox is full, on Twitter I've been getting mentions every second from people saying they want to come to the party, so it's really hard to gauge.

'My Facebook has also gone insane and people have even been emailing my boss, it's a little overwhelming.' 

Fairbanks says the organizers at the LA Coliseum – a sports stadium with a huge 93,000 capacity – reached out to offer the space for Sean's party. 

And it's thanks to their 'amazing' support that things are beginning to come together, she said.

'I was so overwhelmed and stressed out until they got involved and they have been so wonderful,' Fairbanks said.

'We also went to Moby's house today (Monday) and met with him, and he's been really helpful too, there's a lot of people who have come together and have been beyond kind.' 

But Fairbanks says it's still not clear exactly how many people will come to the party. She had originally envisaged a VIP ladies only party and expected to invite around 2,000 guests. 

Searching: Other members of the group  joined in with efforts to identify Sean. Casey Horan wrote: 'We want to throw him a huge dance party with tons of beautiful babes.' Another said: 'Help me and my 2,000 girlfriends'

Star support: Both Pharrell and Moby told Dancing Man not to be ashamed to dance as they posted their support for Sean on Twitter

But the idea has since exploded and the numbers are more likely to hit the tens of thousands with both men and women now allowed. 

'This thing has grown beyond our simple gesture into something global and there's just so many people who are touched and moved that I don't want to exclude anyone,' Fairbanks said. 

'Especially as there is so many people who have reached out expressing their interest in coming to dance.' 

Despite the outpouring of support, Fairbanks fears some people contacting her are wanting to get involved for the 'wrong reasons'.

'I just wanted to make somebody smile, I didn't think it would turn in to this whole production,' she said. 

'But it's beautiful that it's happening, I am so thankful to everybody and I'm so thankful that people around the world are reaching out.' 

Fairbanks said she spoke to Sean yesterday and said he's 'so thankful' for the support. 

'Sean and I really want to do something for a charity that deserves it, that way this thing will be much bigger than Sean and help a lot more people,' she said. 

Fairbanks, who is a human rights activist at The Free Thought Project, says there's a lot of 'really great charities' they are considering working with, but they haven't made a decision yet. 

As for celebrity backers, there's plenty of them. Fairbanks said Hollywood actress Susan Sarandon reached out to her to offer support. Pop singer Ellie Goulding tweeted: 'I want to dance with #dancingman and play at the party.' 

Andrew W.K. wrote: 'Of course! This guy is totally a dance party master and I'm backing him all the way.' 

And Moby posted: 'i offer my dj services for free for #DancingMan #DancingManFound #FindDancingMan . no one should ever be ashamed about dancing.'
