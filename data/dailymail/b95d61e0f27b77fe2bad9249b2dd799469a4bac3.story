When the final FIFA FIFPro World XI is announced at the Ballon d'Or award ceremony at the Kongresshaus in Zurich on January 12, it could end up reading a lot like one of Carlo Ancelotti's team-sheets.

Real Madrid have one goalkeeper, five defenders, three midfielders and three strikers in the 55-player shortlist. 

Coach Ancelotti could also pick up the manger's gong and Cristiano Ronaldo, with a record breaking 17 goals in last season's Champions League campaign, is favourite to win the main prize – the Ballon d'Or.

The current European champions are on a run of 17 straight wins that should extend to 20 with home games against Celta Vigo, Ludogorets and Almeria to come before they travel to Morocco where they will play the Club World Cup. 

By the time the awards ceremony comes around they could be sat on top of the world, as well as favourites to become the first side ever to retain the Champions League. 

The manner in which they have won their last five Champions League games has seen to that. Their La Liga form – brushing aside Barcelona when the two teams in met in October - has them on top and expected to take that crown, too.

When FIFA finally announce their team of teams Madrid will have to cede some territory to other clubs. After a poor World Cup, Iker Casillas maybe be back to his best in La Liga but it will surely be too late to prevent Manuel Neuer from being voted best goalkeeper. 

Atletico Madrid's Diego Godin should be picked in the defence and that will mean that Sergio Ramos and Pepe – both worthy of spots in the XI – will have to contest the other centre-back position.

As one of the Ballon d'Or finalists Lionel Messi will make the team so Real Madrid's BBC forward line of Gareth Bale, Karim Benzema and Ronaldo will not be able to make a clean sweep of the front three.

Ballon d'Or: Cristiano Ronaldo

Best goalkeeper: Iker Casillas

Best defenders: Dani Carvajal, Sergio Ramos, Pepe, Marcelo, Raphael Varane

Best midfielders: Toni Kroos, James Rodriguez, Luka Modric

Best forwards: Cristiano Ronaldo, Gareth Bale, Karim Benzema 

The midfield could well be made up of current Real stars and players who were integral to Madrid's success last season - Luka Modric, James Rodriguez and Toni Kroos are in competition with Angel di Maria and Xabi Alonso.

Whatever shape the final team takes it could comfortably have five Madrid players in it, plus those sold in the summer.

And the powers that be at the Bernabeu won't even mind if players let go in August make the cut. Such has been the success of new faces Kroos and Rodriguez that the sales of Alonso and Di Maria, that stung so much at the start of the season, now no longer trouble supporters.

Rodriguez already has nine goals – just two short of Di Maria's total of 11 for the last campaign. It now looks a masterstroke especially as the Colombia star is on £1.5million-a-year less than the Argentine would have cost under the terms of the new deal he felt – with some justification after his brilliant season – that he deserved.

Scooping the individual prizes in Zurich in January will be no guarantee that come the end of the season Real will have another cupboard full of trophies but there does seem to be a drive about the squad that is missing both from Barcelona and some of the teams they are likely to come up against in the Champions League knockout stages.

A clean sweep in the FIFA FIFPro team is unlikely but they look on course to go on dominating football for some time.
