Messy: Jamie Beckwith claims her ex, Larry, lied about the worth of his company before their divorce

An interior designer is trying to undo a quick divorce from her wealthy ex-husband because she claims he misled her about the value of his energy company before selling it for millions.

Jamie Beckwith, from Franklin, Tennessee, claims her former husband, Larry Beckwith, said his large stake in the ethanol company, Eco-Energy, was worth $15 million - before selling it for $100 million months after their divorce.

In a lawsuit, which seeks the divorce to be scrapped and re-drawn, she claims that the move by the father of her three children left her cheated out of millions.

She also claims that the divorce was forced through after Mr Beckwith, 52, hand-picked a lawyer for her and illegally paid him a $50,000 bonus to speed up the process, The Tennessean reported.

Before the divorce in December 2011, Mr Beckwith owned a majority stake in the biofuel company.

After 16 years of marriage, Mrs Beckwith, who was previously a professional singer, was given $6.8 million in the settlement. This was about half of the $15 million Mr Beckwith claimed he had in the company.

Payout: Eleven months after the divorce, Mr Beckwith, pictured right with a relative, sold his stake in the ethanol company for seven times the value he had suggested it was worth in the divorce

But she is now claiming this was just a fraction of the company's real worth because, just days after the divorce, its value jumped much higher.

According to the lawsuit, he forced through the divorce before December 27, 2011 and just two days later, the U.S. ethanol import tariff was set to expire.

It meant that companies in Brazil were eying businesses in the U.S. because the end of the tariff would mean more exports for the country.

Eleven months later, he sold his share of the company for $100 million to a Brazilian company.

Estate: The couple's seven-bedroom home in Franklin, Tennessee is now on the market for $5.2 million

'During their sixteen years of marriage,
 Mrs. Beckwith was literally kept in the dark concerning Eco-Energy and 
had no knowledge of the finances of the business,' the lawsuit alleges.

A
 recent law school graduate, James Singleton, was hired to assess the 
value of the company, but he underestimated its value, the suit claims.

The
 suit also claims that Mr Beckwith paid $50,000 to both his and his 
wife's attorneys to hurry the paperwork; paying lawyers a bonus in this 
manner is illegal in divorce cases in Tennessee.

Benjamin Papa, who was hired by Mrs Beckwith after her husband suggested him, denied the fee to the Tennessean.

The
 lawsuit alleges fraud, breach of contract, recklessness and other 
charges. She claims that the lawyers' bonuses mean the divorce was 
secured following an act of fraud.

Home: The couple's 3 children split their time between the home and their father's $3.5 million mansion

Mrs Beckwith, an award-winning interior designer, still lives in the couple's home, which is on the market for $5.2 million, while her husband moved nearby into a home worth $3.5 million.

Zillow lists the sprawling former family home, which is in Laurelbrooke, with seven bedrooms and nine bathrooms, as well as spas, a pool and a wine cellar.

Beckwith's Eco-Energy company, which is based in Cool Springs, is a bio-fuel supply chain company which carries out marketing, trading and distribution of biofuels across the U.S.

According to Linkedin, he is now chairman of Beckwith Entertainment Group and LBDB Holdings.
