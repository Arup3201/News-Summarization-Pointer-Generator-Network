President Barack Obama has personally told a retired Army Captain that he will receive the coveted Medal of Honor at a White House ceremony next month after his original application was lost.

Capt William Swenson will become only the sixth living person to receive the military honour when he is presented with his award by the President on October 15.

The army trainer displayed courage in the face of the enemy when US and Afghan troops walked into an ambush in Kunar province, Afghanistan, on September 8, 2009, which came to be known as the Battle of Ganjgal Valley.

According to website Stars and Stripes, the battle lasted for six hours and 
Swensen returned to the gunfire again and again to recover the wounded 
and the dead, while his repeated calls for support went unanswered.

He said: 'It's a monumental event for me, for my family and for my teammates. This day also means lot to those I served with.'

Capt Swenson was first nominated for the award in 2009, 
but Marine General John Allen, had to resubmit the paperwork in 2011 after officials said the original 
nomination had been lost.

Marine Sergeant Dakota Meyer was awarded the Medal of Honor in 2011 for his actions in the same battle.

Capt Swenson, who lives in Seattle, left the Army on February 1, 2011, after nearly nine years service.

In that time he was awardedÂ  the Bronze Star with two oak leaf clusters, the Purple Heart, the Army Commendation Medal, the Afghanistan Campaign Medal with one campaign star, the Iraq Campaign Medal with two campaign stars, the Combat Infantry Badge, the Ranger Tab and the Parachutists Badge.
