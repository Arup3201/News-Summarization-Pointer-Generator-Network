A Taiwanese man managed to survive 60 hours drifting in rough seas, even though he could not swim.

Tseng Lien-fa was catching baby eels off the island's east coast on Friday when he was swept into the water by a large wave.

The 42-year-old managed to survive the terrifying two-and-a-half day ordeal in open water by clinging on to a wooden coffin lid he found floating nearby.

'I managed to hold on as the first wave 
hit me on the chest, but I was overwhelmed by the second and bigger 
wave,' he told a newspaper on the island.

'On the lid, I was drifting and drifting ... during that period I hoped I could be picked up by any ships passing by,' he added.

Local media said there was no explanation of why the lid was present in the sea.

Strong waves eventually swept him onto a beach in the southeastern county of Taitung, 75 kilometres (46 miles) away from where his ordeal began, the reports said.

Coastguards launched a desperate search for Tseng and found him lying on the beach around midday on Sunday.

Doctors said he had only suffered slight dehydration and developed sores on his arms due to seawater immersion.

'Considering the fact that he had not taken in any food or water while drifting at sea for 60 hours and he remained conscious, all I could say about him was that this was a miracle,' said Chen Tien-su, a doctor at Hualien Hospital.

Tseng had been catching eels to make extra money for his fiancee, who is expecting a baby next month.

He has now promised her the fishing expeditions will stop.
