A giant oyster that weighs over 4.4lb has been discovered alive and could be a record breaker.

A team from the Wadden Sea Centre in Denmark found the sizable shellfish that measures more than 13 inches long.

The massive mollusc was discovered in the Wadden Sea and is still alive. It is so large that it has a handful of smaller oysters growing on its shell.

Record breaker? A team from the Wadden Sea Centre in Denmark found the oyster that measures 35.5 centimetres long

Klaus Melbye, of the centre, told Fine Dining Lovers: 'It's an extremely big oyster and it's 
fantastic - it may be the biggest one in the world and is certainly one 
of the biggest we've ever found.

'My staff called me immediately and said we've found this oyster that's as big as a 44 shoe.'

The think it must be around 20 years old but in order to find out, they would have to cut into it.

Oysters grow between three and seven centimetres a year in their early years and as they get older they begin to grow more slowly, Mr Melbye explained.

As oysters grow just one centimetre a year on average later in their lives, the team estimates that the creature is around 20 years-old.

Larger oysters typically cost more than their smaller counterparts in restaurants and as this oyster is so large and rare, it is hard to estimate what it is worth to a discerning foodie.

The creature (pictured) is currently being kept in an aquarium inside the centre. The current holder of the largest oyster record was found in California by Richard Mesce in 2012. It measured 33 centimetres long and 15 centimetres wide

Mr Melbye said: 'We think it's edible - we've found other big oysters out there and the quality of the meat is OK - not always - some of them are thin and look almost like glass but this could be OK.'

The team are waiting for the verdict from Guinness World Records to see is their oyster is indeed the largest ever found but there are complications as the curve of the shell is hard to measure exactly.
