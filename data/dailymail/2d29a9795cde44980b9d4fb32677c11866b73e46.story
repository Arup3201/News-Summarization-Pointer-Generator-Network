Rejected: Sutcliffe has been at Broadmoor for more than 30 years had asked to be moved to a lower-security unit in West Yorkshire - closer to his family and also near where he killed his victims

Yorkshire Ripper Peter Sutcliffe will die inside high-security Broadmoor hospital after his plea to be moved to a lower security unit was rejected.

The serial killer, 68, wanted to be transferred to another location in West Yorkshire to be closer to his family, which would have placed him just a few miles from where he murdered his victims.

He blames ‘biased’ doctors for him failing a medical assessment and said it was ‘impossible’ to properly assess his mental health.

Sutcliffe has been locked inside Broadmoor for more than three decades after he was given 20 life sentences in 1981. He killed 13 women and tried to murder seven more in a five-year spree that made him the country’s most notorious killer.

Sutcliffe wanted to move to a 65-bed unit attached to Fieldhead Hospital in Wakefield but his fate was sealed when a senior doctor ruled there was ‘no change’ in him and he should stay at Broadmoor, which is in Berkshire. An angry Sutcliffe told a friend: ‘This is really unfair. They are biased against me because of who I am. The doctor only came to see me for half an hour, so how can he come up with that decision when he doesn’t know me?’

The West London Mental Health NHS Trust, which is responsible for running the hospital, declined to comment due to patient confidentiality.

It costs taxpayers more than £300,000 to detain Sutcliffe in Broadmoor, at least five times more than the cost of a prison cell.

In 2010, an appeal over his sentence that could have led to him applying for parole was rejected, with a High Court judge saying he should never be released.

Sutcliffe suffers from diabetes and his health has deteriorated. He had a hernia operation last year and has since been suffering from a debilitating cough. He has been taking medication which has made him put on weight and has increased his blood pressure. Two weeks ago he suffered an attack of angina.

Sutcliffe wanted to move around 170 miles north to Yorkshire so his family would be able to visit more often. But it would have also placed him closer to the families of his victims.

One source told The Sun: ‘He thinks the powers that be want him to be there until the end.

‘The report says he should not be transferred as nothing has changed and he has not shown any real remorse for his killings.

‘This is a real setback for him, especially on top of all his health problems. Peter is now having trouble speaking, he is bloated and looks constantly tired.’

Despite his health problems, Sutcliffe is preparing for a comfortable Christmas inside Broadmoor and has already received more than 60 greeting cards.

He has also sent more than 100 cards despite being a Jehovah’s Witness who does not celebrate Christmas.

He and other patients, including Robert Napper, who murdered Rachel Nickell on Wimbledon Common in 1992, will sit down to a turkey meal with all the trimmings on December 25.

Sutcliffe used weapons including a hammer, screwdriver and knives to mutilate women across the north of England. He believed he was on a ‘mission from God’ to kill sex workers. He rarely discusses his crimes and now tells friends and family it was the Devil rather than God telling him to commit the killings.

Broadmoor was designed by a military engineer and was the first custom-built asylum to house criminals when it was developed in 1863. It is designated as a psychiatric hospital rather than a jail.

The hospital opened up its doors to cameras for the first time in its 150-year history for an ITV documentary screened last month. Sutcliffe refused to take part, and complained about it during the recording.
