After making quite possibly the greatest catch in NFL history last month, Odell Beckham Jnr showcased his skills once again... this time with his feet.

A self-confessed fan of Real Madrid superstar Cristiano Ronaldo, the New York Giants wide receiver wowed the fans with a cheeky rainbow kick as he prepared for their clash with the Tennessee Titans.

Once asked to trial for the US National Soccer Team at the age of 13, it's no surprise that Beckham has the skills in his locker to rival those of his namesake and former England captain David.

Practising his now-trademark one-handed catch before the match, OBJ's showboating didn't stop there as he went on to leapfrog 6-foot-tall Josh Brown.

Beckham Jnr hit the headlines back in November following a gravity-defying catch in a match against the Dallas Cowboys.

Pulling in a 43-yard pass from Eli Manning as his New York Giants side went down to the Cowboys, Beckham's touchdown catch went viral.

Drafted with the No 12 pick from Louisiana State in the 2014 NFL draft the 22-year-old's catch shocked the sporting world, with stars like LeBron James claiming it was 'the greatest'.
