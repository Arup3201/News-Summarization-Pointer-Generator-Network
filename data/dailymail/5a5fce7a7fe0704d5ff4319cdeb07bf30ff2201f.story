Britain's smartest web experts and technology entrepreneurs could be hired by spy agencies to help tackle global threats.

Plans are being drawn up to allow high fliers to join the GCHQ listening agency on a short-term contract instead of signing up as spooks for life.

The scheme would be based on Teach First in which graduates spend at least two years in challenging schools before being given the option to head back to the world of business.

It is hoped that GCHQ would benefit from expertise from some of the county's brightest and best to help deal with the rise of cyber terrorism and tracking threats around the world.

The idea has been inspired by work by the Israeli government, which has enlisted tech stars to work in the Israel Defence Forces' Unit 8200 - the equivalent of GCHQ.

Many who served in the unit have gone on to set up some of the country's leading IT companies, worth billions of pounds.

Cabinet Office minister Francis Maude said in a speech last month: 'I have long admired the Israeli start-up nation which is home to more high-tech start-ups per capita than any other country.

'What struck me most was that the Israeli culture of innovation wasn't down to the facilities or the technology, impressive though they were.

'It was the people – and the human relationships – they were the critical element.

'It came down to a group of individuals, perhaps as few as just 2 or 3, sitting together to find a solution or to work through a brilliant idea – thinking together, experimenting together, failing, learning, adapting and ultimately succeeding.'

Ministers are considering how GCHQ's intellectual property could used commercially.

'We have loads of talented people working for GCHQ - and there is no shortage of academic excellence,' a Cabinet Office source told The Independent.

'The question is can we create a secure space where business can work with GCHQ and build an eco-system between the two.

'It is not a million miles from Teach First and we have thought about that link.

'The idea is to say to graduates you do not have to sign up to GCHQ for your whole career and there are options for you in the private sector.

'There is more thinking to be done and a debate to be had about how it might work but we want to capitalise on the expertise in GCHQ in terms of IT commercialisation.'

A security source added: 'Although there is more thinking to be done, we think the Israeli model is interesting and are considering if we can learn from it to build on the significant work that GCHQ already does, in partnership with industry and academia, to develop the technical skills the UK needs to meet its cyber security objectives.'

Last month it emerged children as young as 13 are being given lessons in combating cyber terrorism amid concerns over the UK’s vulnerability to attacks similar to the hacking of entertainment giant Sony.

Those behind the scheme include experts at the Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ), the top-secret organisation that provides electronic surveillance of the nation’s enemies.

The Government is taking the scheme so seriously that next summer’s GCSE computer science exam will contain questions about cyber security for the first time.
