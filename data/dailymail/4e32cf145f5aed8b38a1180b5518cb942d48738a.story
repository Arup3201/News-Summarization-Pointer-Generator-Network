Harry Redknapp claimed QPR will fight to the end after Charlie Austin’s stunning double against Aston Villa lifted them off the bottom for the table.

Austin scored in each half to pile the misery on Paul Lambert’s side and they are now without a goal in a staggering 531 minutes of football in the Barclays Premier League.

Austin’s two goals at Loftus Road has given Rangers hope ahead of the weekend’s trip to Chelsea.

Redknapp said: ‘It was a great result. We played well against Liverpool, Stoke, Hull and Sunderland and we worked hard again.

‘They were two great finishes for Charlie. I couldn’t be more pleased. He’s a fantastic lad, an absolutely smashing boy. ‘He’s come from non-league, played at Poole Town, Hungerford, god knows hwere he has been around the lower divisions. And now he is scoring goals in the Premier league, it’s great for him.

‘It is always important to get the points. I have no need to deflect the result, as I was supposed to have done.

‘Part of a football club is having good lads, but they can’t all play. As long as you have a good dressing room and good professionals you’ve got a good chance of winning games.

‘Rio Ferdinand was shouting and hollering and said I have never been so nervous and I said "wait until you become a manager, Rio" which he will do one day. ‘Then you’ll find out how you feel. And he was doing that during the game. He wants the team to win.’ Redknapp claimed his row with Adel Taarabt is over and revealed that the winger, recovering from a sore throat, will play in a reserve team game on Tuesday.

The QPR chief said: ‘He’s working hard this week with the fitness coaches and the reserves have a game tomorrow so he will get a game into him.

‘It’s finished. He can still play a part in the future if he gets himself fit. That’s all I ask people to do is come in and train and be thankful for being a professional footballer.

‘Work hard, god gave them a fantastic talent, I just hope you don’t waste it. He’s a fantastic talent.

‘I just want him to get himself fit to run around like the boys tonight. I don’t want our team to be out-worked.

‘If you get out-worked you don’t win football matches. The stats now show we out-worked Liverpool and Im sure they will show we did the same against Villa.’ Redknapp also paid tribute to his defence after they kept a clean sheet for the first time since their victory over Sunderland.

The Rangers boss added: ‘I thought Richard Dunne was man of the match. It was a good performance all round.’
