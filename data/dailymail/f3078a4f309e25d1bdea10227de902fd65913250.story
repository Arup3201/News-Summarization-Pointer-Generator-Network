A female Indian rhino calf born recently in New York was produced by artificial insemination using sperm from a now-dead Cincinnati Zoo rhino.

Zoo officials call the calf, dubbed Monica, born June 5 at the Buffalo Zoo a victory for endangered species.

The father was named Jimmy and died at the Cincinnati Zoo in 2004. His sperm was frozen, stored and later taken to Buffalo.

Long-awaited: Tashi rests with her new calf who was born after a 16-month gestation period

First descendant: Monica is the first offspring of Jimmy, who died at the Cincinnati Zoo in 2004

The calf's 17-year-old mother is named Tashi. She previously conceived and successfully gave birth through natural breeding in 2004 and 2008.

But her mate died, and Buffalo's new male Indian rhino hasn't reached sexual maturity.

Zoo staff prioritized getting Tashi pregnant, because long intervals between pregnancies in rhinos can result in long-term infertility.

Monica is the first offspring of the long-dead Jimmy, who never fathered any offspring during his lifetime.

Rhino keeper Joe Hauser and vet Dr Kurt Volle worked closely with the Cinnicinatti Zoo's Center for Conservation and Research of Endangered Wildlife (CREW) to plan the successful artificial insemination and to monitor Tashi during her 16-month gestation.

Dedicated: Monica the rhino calf with head rhino keeper at Buffalo Zoo Joe Hauser and CREW Reproductive Physiologist Dr. Monica Stoops, her namesake

She was named after one of the veterinarians whose hard work helped bring her to life.

'Without Dr. Monica Stoops’ dedication to the species, and to the development of AI science, there is no doubt this calf would not be here today,' said Hauser.

'She has spent countless hours spear-heading research and technology for Indian rhino conservation and the Buffalo Zoo is excited to acknowledge that dedication and announce that the name of the calf is Monica.'

Buffalo officials say the calf weighed 144 pounds at birth. They say there are only 59 Indian rhinos in captivity in North America and about 2,500 in the wild.

'We are excited to share the news of Tashi’s calf with the world as it demonstrates how collaboration and teamwork among the Association of Zoos & Aquariums (AZA) organizations are making fundamental contributions to rhino conservation,” said Dr Monica Stoops, Reproductive Physiologist at the Cincinnati Zoo’s CREW.

'It is deeply heartening to know that the Cincinnati Zoo's beloved male Indian rhino Jimmy will live on through this calf and we are proud that CREW's CryoBioBank continues to contribute to this endangered species' survival.'
