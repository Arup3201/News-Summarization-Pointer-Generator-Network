No explosives were found on a Southwest Airlines flight that was diverted to Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport following a bomb threat Monday afternoon.

Special Agent Manuel Johnson, a spokesman for the FBI's Phoenix division, says Flight 2675 left Los Angeles International Airport at 2:12 p.m. and was heading to Austin before the threat was received by telephone.

The plane landed safely at Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport at about 3 p.m.

The 143 passengers were interviewed and their luggage was inspected. Bomb squad technicians along with bomb-sniffing dogs searched the plane for explosives.

Authorities are still investigating who made the threat.

The plane was isolated on the tarmac away from the terminal buildings.

The incident affected both departing and arriving flights. Flights were taking off and landing only on the south side of the airport on Sky Harbor's two south runways.

Airport officials reported many delays and urged travelers to check their flight status.
