Authorities say two boaters were about two miles from the brink of Niagara Falls when they were rescued from their disabled vessel by a U.S. Coast Guard helicopter.

Coast Guard officials say their Buffalo station received a call around 9:15 pm Monday reporting a 19-foot motor boat with two men aboard was anchored in the Niagara River

The vessel was  2,000 feet inside the 2.5-mile exclusion zone from the falls where boats are banned for safety reasons.

Pulled from the brink: Authorities say two boaters were about two miles from the brink of Niagara Falls when they were rescued from their disabled vessel by a U.S. Coast Guard helicopter. Night vision footage taken from the helicopter shows the heroic rescue as it happened

The boat managed to drop anchor just two miles from the falls, which put it 2,000 feet into the exclusion zone where vessels are banned for safety reasons

A crew from the Coast Guard air station in Detroit was dispatched to the scene, along with a Coast Guard vessel from Buffalo and boat crews from state and local police.

The river's shallow depth prevented the vessels from reaching the anchored boat. 

instead, a Coast Guard helicopter had to rescue the two boaters, which they did shortly before midnight.

The boat remains on the river as its owner is arranges salvage with a commercial service company.
