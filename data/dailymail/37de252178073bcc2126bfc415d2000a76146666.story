Lewis Hamilton will not jeopardise his chances of winning the Spanish Grand Prix by repeating the erratic driving style he deployed at the last race in China.

Hamilton, who will again start on pole position here in Barcelona, slowed down and weaved during the parade lap three weeks ago, causing the cars behind him to slam on their brakes and in some cases to stop altogether.

The Mail on Sunday has learnt that race officials discussed Hamilton's strange behaviour at the time but decided not to penalise him.

Job done: Lewis Hamilton secured the 35th pole position of his grand prix career in Spain on Saturday

However, the matter was brought up at the drivers' meeting on Friday evening and Hamilton apologised to his fellow racers and promised not to replicate the same antics.

As long as he keeps his nose clean, Hamilton is likely to win Sunday's race after a brilliant performance in qualifying.

He finished 0.168sec ahead of his Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg to claim his fourth pole position in five races this season.

For all the talk of upgrades to the cars of rivals at the opportunity offered by the first race of the European stage of the season, Mercedes have seemingly maintained their significant advantage over the rest.

Nobody can live with them: Daniel Ricciardo, of Red Bull, was third fastest, a full second back from Hamilton.

'I'm very disappointed,' said Rosberg. 'I don't particularly like coming second to Lewis. I did a good lap but he did a better job.'

There is a danger, implicit in what Rosberg said, that Hamilton can waltz to his second world title. He has won three of the four races, the only blip being a technical malfunction at the opening round in Melbourne.

Rosberg won that race and was runner-up at the next three, meaning that he takes a four-point lead into Sunday's race in Barcelona. Hamilton has not led the standings since he did so fleetingly in 2012.

'That was my one small taste of leading the championship for some time, but otherwise I don't remember the last time,' he said.

'As long as you're leading when you cross the finish line at the last race, that's what counts. But it's my goal to get in front and stay there.'

Hamilton accomplished his pole position feat despite having problems with his machinery. He came on the radio to say: 'I don't know how but we've made the car worse.'

He later explained: 'In practice we had such a great car and often when things are that good you don't want to change much. But we changed a few things over night in the hope of making things a little bit better – small things, like half a millimetre here and there.  'But today they car was a real handful.'

Best of the rest: Daniel Ricciardo will start in third ahead of Sebastian Vettel who broke down on track

The same could be said of the world champion, Sebastian Vettel. The gearbox of his Red Bull failed, condemning him to start 10th and adding to a season of woe. How he must be irked by the performances of his team-mate Ricciardo. 'I'm quite disappointed,' said Vettel.

It was a dismal day, too, for McLaren. Jenson Button was eighth fastest – impressive in the circumstances – and his rookie team-mate Kevin Magnussen 15th.

The feel-good factor that came with Ron Dennis's return is dissipating. It will take time for the structural changes that are slowly evolving to take full effect.
