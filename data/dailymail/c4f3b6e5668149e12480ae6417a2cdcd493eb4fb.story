The US has closed evacuated its embassy as rebels close in on the capital of Central African Republic.

The US ambassador and other diplomats were evacuated by plane overnight amid fears rebels could try to take the capital Bangui.

US officials said about 40 people were evacuated on an US Air Force plane bound for Kenya.

It comes after President Francois Bozize called for urgent help from France and other foreign powers to fend off the rebels who are quickly seizing territory and approaching the capital Bangui.

Denied: Former colonial ruler France has refused to provide military assistance to Bozize (centre) but is trying to broker peace talks

The UN Security Council condemned the recent violence and expressed concern about the developments.

'The members of the Security Council reiterate their demand that the armed groups immediately cease hostilities, withdraw from captured cities and cease any further advance towards the city of Bangui,' the statement said.

But France said it will not offer any military assistance and the developments suggest the country could be on the brink of another violent change in government.

Mr Bozize came to power nearly a decade ago in the wake of a rebellion.

Speaking to crowds in the capital, which is home to 600,000 people, the president pleaded with foreign powers to do what they could. He pointed in particular to France, Central African Republic's former colonial ruler.

About 200 French soldiers are already in the country, providing technical support and helping to train the local army, according to the French defence ministry.

The landlocked Central African Republic is one of the world's poorest despite having a wealth of diamonds, timber and gold

'France has the means to stop (the rebels) but unfortunately they have done nothing for us until now,' Mr Bozize said.

French president Francois Hollande said that France wants to protect its interests in Central African Republic and not Mr Bozize's government.

Mr Hollande said their presence in the country was 'in no way to intervene in the internal business of a country. Those days are over'.

The comments came a day after dozens of protesters, angry about a lack of help against rebel forces, threw rocks at the French Embassy in Bangui and stole a French flag.

Paris is encouraging peace talks between the government and the rebels and the French foreign ministry said negotiations will start soon in Gabon.

French foreign minister Laurent Fabius has also asked the Central African Republic government to be responsible for the safety of French citizens in the country.

Neighbour and ally Chad has pledged to send 2,000 troops but it is not clear if they have arrived and whether they can stop the rebels, which consist of at least four different groups.

They have already seized ten towns across the north of the country.

They claim they are justified in light of the 'thirst for justice, for peace, for security and for economic development of the people of Central African Republic.'

Despite having a wealth of gold, diamonds, timber and uranium, the country remains one of the poorest in the world.

Following independence from France in 1960, the country has suffered decades of army revolts, coups and rebellions.

The rebels signed a peace deal in 2007 but have accused Mr Bozize of failing to keep it.
