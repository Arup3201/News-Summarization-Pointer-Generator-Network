Taken: A sketch shows Fannie Millier, one of the abducted Amish girls. The Amish forbid photos

A desperate search is underway for two Amish girls after they were apparently abducted from their family's roadside stand in northern New York last night.

Six-year-old Delila Miller and 12-year-old Fannie Miller were bundled into a white car as they went to help a customer in Oswegatchie around 7.20pm on Wednesday, according to reports.

On Thursday, the St. Lawrence County Sheriff's Office released a drawing of what one of the girls, Fannie, looks like. Members of the Amish community do not allow photos of themselves, which they see as an act of pride and a violation of their religious beliefs.

Kevin Wells said his office has received 'numerous leads' and that state troopers, forest rangers and U.S. Border Patrol agents were part of the search. Dive teams have also been called in to scour the nearby Oswegatchie River.

'There's no indication to take us any certain direction at this point,' Sheriff Kevin Wells told WWNY. 'We're following all leads and we're making sure we overturn every stone that we're aware of and we're moving from there.'

The girls had been milking in their 
family's barn on Wednesday evening when they headed to the road because 
they believed a customer was at the vegetable stand, WWNY reported last night.

Search: Officials search a field after the girls vanished; a witness said he saw a white car near their stand

An Amish witness who was passing told authorities that he saw a man put something in the back of his white four-door sedan and, when he drove off, the little girls were gone.

Authorities had placed a protective covering on tire tracks on the road and were going through the register of sex offenders in the area.

They said they do not have a license plate number from the car and have not identified a suspect.

'It's a scant trail,' Undersheriff Scott Bonno said. 'We don't have a lot of good leads, but you begin to utilize logic. We're going to start looking at sex offenders in the community, just to eliminate them as suspects, if nothing else.'

Authorities say both girls were wearing dark
 blue dresses with blue aprons and black bonnets in line with Amish 
custom - but warned that their abductor might have changed their 
clothes.

Delila Miller has brown hair, brown 
eyes, weighs about 50 pounds and is roughly four feet tall. She has a 
round scar on her forehead and is missing front teeth.

Fannie Miller also has brown hair and brown eyes and is five feet tall and about 90 pounds. She is crosseyed.

Both of the girls have heavy accents and speak in the Pennsylvania Dutch dialect, but the 12-year-old, Fannie, speaks English, SYR reported.

Sheriff Kevin Wells added that because of the time that passed since their disappearance, the girls may be wearing different clothing or have had their hair cut.

Oswegatchie is on the Canadian border 150 miles northwest of Albany.

Anyone with any information about the abduction is asked to call 911.
