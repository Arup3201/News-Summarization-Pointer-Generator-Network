The American public views Jews, Catholics and evangelical Christians far more warmly than Muslims and atheists, according to a new study.

The Pew Research Center, a ‘nonpartisan fact tank’, asked members of the public to tally eight religious groups with a ‘feeling thermometer’ scale ranging from 0 to 100, with 0 meaning a cold, negative feeling, and 100 the warmest, most positive.

Jews, Catholics and evangelical Christians all received an average score of 60 or higher, the Center reported.

Poll: The Pew Research Center, a 'nonpartisan fact tank', asked members of the public to tally various religious groups with a 'feeling thermometer' - and Jews, Catholics and evangelical Christians scored highest

Jews scored 63, Catholics 62 and evangelical Christians 61. However, Muslims received an average rating of 40 and atheists 41.

More than four in 10 (41 per cent) gave Muslims a distinctly icy rating of 33 or below, and 40 per cent rated atheists in the same part of the thermometer.

Participants generally had luke-warm feelings towards Buddhists, Hindus and Mormons, which scored 53, 50 and 48 respectively.

Overall ratings: The thermometer shows how Jews are viewed most warmly and Muslims the least

Perhaps not surprisingly, members of religious groups viewed their own faith much more positively than others.

Followers of the Catholic faith rated Catholics a toasty 80, while evangelical Christians gave members of their faith a score of 79.

For white evangelical Protestants, its atheists they view most coldly, giving them a thermometer reading of 25.

And it seems the feeling is mutual, because atheists gave evangelical Christians a frosty 28. 

The study, which polled 3,200 adults, also cross-referenced results with political opinions.

It found that Republicans saved their warmest feelings for evangelicals, giving them an average thermometer rating of 71.

Jews and Catholics are the next most-liked, with scores of 67 and 66. Those who follow Islam, in contrast, received a chilly 33 and atheists 34.

These results are mirrored in some respects for Democrats, who gave Jews an average rating of 62 and Catholics 61.

However, they view Muslims and atheists more warmly, giving them a more generous score of 47 and 46.
