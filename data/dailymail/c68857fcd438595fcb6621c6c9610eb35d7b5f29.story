A computer gamer smashed a cup against a wall and a ripped up a photograph of his girlfriend's dead grandmother because she asked him to stop playing on his Xbox.

Jonathan Todd, 26, of Boldon Colliery, Sunderland, became angry when he was asked to stop playing the game at 6.30 in the morning by his girlfriend because she had to get up early for work.

A court heard he had been drinking in the evening and when he refused to stop playing an argument flared up, which is when he smashed the cup and ripped up the picture, which led to police being called.

South Tyneside Magistrates' Court (pictured) heard Jonathan Todd became angry when he was asked to stop playing the game non-stop through the night by his girlfriend because she had to get up early for work

Speaking at South Tyneside Magistrates' Christopher Rose, prosecuting, said: 'The injured party in this case is the defendant's partner.

'She says that she had been in a relationship with the defendant for some time and they had been living together for about a year.

'They get along well until the defendant has a drink and then he becomes very abusive towards her.

'She says that from November 19 to the following day, the defendant had been continually playing on his Xbox in the bedroom and drinking beer and cider.

The court heard Todd had been drinking when he refused to stop playing on theXbox, which caused an argument between the couple to flare up

'He had been playing on the machine almost non-stop and keeping her awake. This resulted in an argument.

'She woke up and saw him playing on the Xbox and asked him to turn it off as she had to go to work early but he refused and an argument developed.

'She managed to get back to sleep again and then the following morning, at 6.30am, she awoke and he was still on the Xbox and she was annoyed at him and there was a further argument and altercation.

'The altercation continued and eventually the police were called.

'While she was waiting for the police there were texts from the defendant saying he was sorry for what he had done.'

In a victim statement, the injured partner said: 'I am very upset that Jonathan ripped up a picture of my nan, who passed away last year.'

Charles Carr, defending, said: 'He did smash a ceramic cup which had a picture of his girlfriend on it. Because his partner had smashed his glass he threw her cup against the wall, that's the level of it.

'There is no history of domestic violence between this young couple and this was an isolated incident. I understand they are now seeking a reconciliation.'

 Todd admitted criminal damage and was given a six-month conditional discharge and ordered to pay costs of £85 and a victim surcharge of £15.
