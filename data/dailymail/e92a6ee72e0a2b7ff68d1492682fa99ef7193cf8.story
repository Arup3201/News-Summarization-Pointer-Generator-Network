The terrorism threat level for Australian police has been elevated to high.

The Australian Federal Police say the change is a result of intelligence and discussions with its partners, and is in line with the broader threat level for the community.

'Recent events in France, Canada and Australia serve as a sobering reminder of the risks associated with policing,' the AFP said.

'While relatively small, there are increasing numbers of Australians who are connected with or inspired by overseas terrorist groups such as the Islamic State ... with the intent and capability to conduct an attack against police.'

Australia's general terrorism threat level was raised in September.

Queensland Police Commissioner Ian Stewart said he had sent emails to his officers as well as their families to tell them about what the new threat level meant for them and ease their minds. 

'I have taken the action that mirrors what I did back in September. I have reminded all officers the need to be aware of environment around them as well as their personal safety, and the safety of their family and loved ones,' he said.

Mr Stewart said there had been no direct threats made to police officers or staff members.

'Because of previous events and now world events, that level does go up to high,' Mr Stewart said. 

Recent events, such as the Martin Place siege (police are pictured above removing items from the Sydney scene), have contributed to raising the threat level to officers

The police commissioner pointed to a recent incident in France where a police station was attacked as an example of what was taken into account when making the change in the threat level.

He said the public would not see much change in the community as police had already taken steps to ramp up operations following the G20 summit and the elevation of the nationwide terror threat in September.

'In real terms what the security assessment is saying is that we must take cognisance of what has occurred overseas,' Mr Stewart said. 

'There have been instances there was one in France where a police station was attacked and officers have been attacked in the street – not necessarily by terrorists.'
