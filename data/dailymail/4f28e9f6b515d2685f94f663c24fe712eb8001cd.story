It is a grim outlook for the fate of Bali Nine ringleaders Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran as six people convicted of drug offences were executed by firing squad in Indonesia under its new hard-line president.

President Joko Widodo ordered his first round of executions in the early hours of Sunday, with four men and six women dying.

One woman, Rani Andriani, was from Indonesia while the rest hailed from Brazil, the Netherlands, Vietnam, Malawi and Nigeria.

Vietnamese woman Tran Thi Bich Hanh was executed in Boyolali district in central Java, while Andriani, Brazilian Marco Archer Cardoso Moreira, Dutchman Ang Kiem Soei, Nigerian Daniel Enemuo and Malawi's Namaona Denis were put to death on Nusa Kambangan Island.

The island is home to a high-security prison located off the south coast of the archipelago's main island of Java.

All of the executed were caught attempting to smuggle drugs, except for Soei who was found guilty of operating a huge ecstasy-producing factory.

The executions of those who were handed their sentences between 2000 and 2001 were carried out just after midnight on Sunday, the ABC reported Indonesian attorney-general's office spokesman Tony Spontana as saying.  

Chan, 31, and Sukumaran, 33, are expected to be executed this year, but the former is waiting to hear back from the court about whether or not he has been granted clemency.

The latter had his appeal rejected last month, 9News reported.

In a last-ditch effort to save his client from meeting the same fate as those executed on Sunday, Sukumaran's Indonesia lawyer Todung Mulya Lubis told News Corp he would be submitting a request to Denpasar District Court for a case review next week.

This review, which is called a PK in the south-east Asian country, is usually granted when new evidence emerges. 

Both Chan and Sukumaran have had previous PKs rejected before.

But it is not known if an appeal for a second review will even be allowed as there is no legislation surrounding the issue as of yet in Indonesia.

Mr Lubis said the law had been applied wrongly to the last review, which was denied by the Supreme Court.

The lawyer will argue Sukumaran, who has served 10 years in prison, is now reformed and has helped fellow prisoners also rehabilitate by setting up in-house jail programs.

'If the purpose of any sentence is rehabilitation... those who have made a significant change in their life should be given relief. It doesn’t mean that he has to be freed because he has also admitted that he is guilty of a narcotic crime, Mr Lubis told News Corp.

'However, there are many forms of punishment. A life sentence or 20 years prison term or 25 years prison term. There are many forms of other punishment. I just want to ensure that the perspective of justice should be at the forefront.'

The members of the Bali Nine were arrested in 2005 on charges of a plot to smuggle 8.2kg heroin into Australia

If the pair - who were caught trying to smuggle in 8.2kg of heroin from Indonesia to Australia in 2005 - are to be executed, Sunday would have given them a grim preview of what was to come for them.

Before the six convicted drug offenders faced the firing squad, made of 12 police officers, they were isolated in cells and were allowed last visits from family members and religious figures in the lead up to their deaths.

They were lined up and donned aprons that had reflectors attached on them over their hearts.

The six were shot dead all at the same time on Sunday.

Their executions have attracted widespread criticism from world leaders, including from Amnesty International, calling for Mr Widodo to scrap the death penalty.

The organisation's research director for south-east Asia and the Pacific, Rupert Abbott, called the executions 'a seriously regressive move'.

'The new administration has taken office on the back of promises to make human rights a priority, but the execution of six people flies in the face of these commitments,' Mr Abbott said in a statement.

'This is a country that just a few years ago had taken positive steps to move away from the death penalty, but the authorities are now steering the country in the opposite direction.

'The government must immediately halt plans to put more people to death.'

Mr Abbott urged Indonesia to 'impose a moratorium on the use of the death penalty with a view to its eventual abolition'.

While the European Union's foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini called the plan 'deeply regrettable'.

News of the looming executions has galvanised Australians seeking clemency for Chan and Sukumaran, with 2,500 signatures on a petition begging Indonesian president Joko Widodo for mercy on their behalf.
