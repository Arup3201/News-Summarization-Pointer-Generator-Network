Airline staff are trained to try to solve customers' travelling problems, but one selfless employee has gone above and beyond the call of duty.

The Alaska Airlines employee, Judy Reid, paid out of her own pocket to fly a stranded customer home in a heartwarming act of kindness.

Vancouver resident Miriam Thomas was left stranded and confused as she was trying to return from a business trip to California, when her ticket to Seattle with Delta Air Lines, an Alaska Airlines partner, was cancelled.

Miriam Thomas tweeted her frustration after being told she would have to stay in California due to a mix-up

The situation looked bleak for Miriam, who was told that she would have to spend the night in a hotel and take another flight the next day.

'The woman from Delta comes over and says "OK, so, the best we can do is get you on a flight for tomorrow." I started to panic, I had nowhere to stay,' Miriam, a developer, told Vancouver radio station News 1130.

'The two women I was dealing with from Alaska Airlines were comforting me. They were saying, "don't worry, we're going to figure this out.'"

That's when Judy incredibly reached for her own purse to use her travel vouchers.

'She didn't need to do that at all, she took care of me,' Miriam told News1130.

Miriam said she overheard Judy's co-workers protesting, saying she shouldn't have to use her own money to cover a complete stranger's flight

Judy insisted that she was just paying it forward.  

The developer shared her happiness that a total stranger helped her out of her dilemma

Safe at home! Thomas spread her gratitude for Reid's gesture to her followers via social media 

Despite Miriam's stunned reaction, Reid said she was just doing what was right, and that she would have done it for anybody.

She told News 1130: 'You have to help each other. You have to make this a peaceful world. I was raised in a very, very, good, giving, caring family. I've always been told to pay it forward. Even if nothing good happens, you've done something good.' 

Thomas is trying to find a way to thank the selfless employee, and to pay the act forward to someone else in need. 

Alaska Airlines tried to reimburse Judy for her kind actions, but she declined.

A spokesperson from Delta Air Lines said: 'Delta’s Customer Care team has been in contact with Ms. Thomas. 

'We apologise for the inconvenience that Ms. Thomas encountered. 

'Delta will be refunding the total amount of the ticket.'
