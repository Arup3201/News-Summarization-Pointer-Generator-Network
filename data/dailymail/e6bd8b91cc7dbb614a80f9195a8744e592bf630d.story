Hosts Equatorial Guinea pulled off one of the shocks of the tournament to reach the quarter finals of the Africa Cup of Nations.

The National Lightening, as the Equato-Guinean side are known, stunned Gabon thanks to a penalty from Javier Balboa and a late second from Ivan Edu to put their neighbours out of the competition.

Balboa scored from the spot to convert a penalty he won himself, having pulled off a lovely step over before bursting into the box where he was tripped by Lloyd Palun.

The former Real Madrid striker stepped up to take it himself, and dispatched it brilliantly to send the Bata crowd into delirium.

The winger could have made it two fourteen minutes from time, but after being brilliantly slid through on he fired his shot to close to Didier Ovono, who saved with his legs.

However it wasn’t to prove costly, as Ivan Edu rounded off a counter-attack in the 86th minute to secure the victory.

It continues the remarkable statistic that no host nation has failed to get out of the group stages of this tournament since 1994, but few have had so many factors against them in the build-up.

Disqualified for fielding an ineligible player seven months ago, Equatorial Guinea only found out they were playing again when they took over from Morocco as hosts in November.

They then changed manager in January, current boss Estaban Becker only stepping across from the women’s national team two weeks before the tournament began.

But, against all the odds, their team, which includes part-timers from the domestic league, showed incredible spirit to hold on against a Gabonese side that post players from all around Europe’s top teams.

The hosts had their goalkeeper to thank for the clean sheet that saw them into the last eight.

Felipe Ovono (not to be confused with Gabon’s stopper Didier Ovono) was up to the test in the first half, saving well from both a powerful Aubameyang header and then from a stinging Bulot drive in the first half.

His best stops came in the minutes immediately after half time, when he acrobatically pushed a brilliant Aubameyang free kick over the bar, before denying Bulot from a similar free kick with another excellent save.

Equatorial Guinea came into the game knowing that despite two creditable draws in their first two games, they would have to beat Gabon to go through, whatever the result in the group’s other game between Congo and the disappointing Burkina Faso.

Perhaps unsurprisingly Gabon, ranked 56 places above their hosts in the World Rankings, were the better side for much of the game, dominating possession and the early chances. With Borussia Dortmund’s Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Charlton’s Frederic Bulot either side of the dangerous Malick Evouna a threat going forward.

But the hosts did create a few opportunities of their own, with Middlesbrough’s Emilio Nsue, scorer of his country’s only previous goal this tournament, a threat in behind.

Twice he almost found striker Raul Fabiani with a clever ball across the box, only for the Gabonese defence to clear at the last moment.

And soon after Equatorial Guinea had taken the lead Nsue forced a save from Didier Ovono on the counter-attack, but the hosts seemed content to sit back and await the Gabonese onslaught once they had their all-important lead.

There were nervous moments – Bulot had a cross deflected just over the bar, and moments later the Charlton man fired over the bar from 8 yards out with the goal unguarded.

But, remarkably, it was the hosts who looked the more likely to score when they picked off their opponents on the break, as Gabon struggled to shine in the most electric of atmospheres.

And with four minutes remaining one such counter produced the goal that sealed it, Nsue’s shot parried into the path of Ivan Edu, who scuffed it home.

In the end Congo’s win, thanks in part to a goal from former West Brom forward Thievy Bifouma, meant that they will move away from their fortress in Bata – where they remain unbeaten – to play their quarter-final in Ebebiyin, a tiny town in the north-east of the country.

But, on Sunday night in the tiny west African state, that was never going to put a damper on the wild celebrations.
