Saved: Derek Ramsden was rescued from sinking mud after his dog Toby raised the alarm

A loyal lapdog became a lifesaver after his owner fell into mud and began to sink.

Derek Ramsden, 81, was holidaying in Wales with his wife Ada, 71 and his two dogs Bruno, an 18-year-old Staffie Cross and Toby - a seven-year-old Lhasa Apso.

He was walking the dogs when he slipped and fell from a small ridge.

While Bruno simply walked away, Toby ran for a quarter of a mile to alert staff at the Brynowen Holiday Park in Borth, Aberystwyth to his master’s plight.

Derek, from Halifax, West Yorkshire, said: 'I managed to get hold of a railing on the bridge. It was frightening. I could not get out and you can’t hold your grip for long at my age.

'I don’t like to think what would have happened if not for Toby. He definitely saved my life.

'Toby had barked anxiously at the staff. They must have known there was a problem and followed him back to me. Toby led the way and kept stopping for his helpers to catch up.

'Toby is dedicated to both of us and I think he is a hero, I was surprised because he doesn’t normally make friends and he had already barked at the staff when we walked past them.

'He’s my very own Lassie. He saved my life and I’m very grateful.'

Ada said her husband had been missing an hour and she grew concerned and set off in search of him.

'My very own Lassie': Derek was suprised by Toby's quick thinking, saying the seven-year-old Lhasa Apso 'doesn't normally make friends'

She then came across him and the park staff who had pulled him to safety.

'He was covered in mud from head to foot. If he had let go he could have slipped down further. Toby saved him,' she said.

Derek suffered bruising to his back.

Park maintenance manager Ben Thompson had earlier seen Derek and the dogs setting off and told how he and his colleague Martin Riley came to the rescue.

'It had been raining and the ground was slippy.

'The dog knew what it was doing. It ran past apartments through bushes and alerted security.

'Toby barked for attention and moved towards where he came from so staff followed.

'The dog was leading the way and without the dog we would not have known he was there. That dog certainly has something about it.'

When staff reached Mr Ramsden they were able to pull him out and walk him to safety. Mr and Mrs Ramsden will shortly be giving Toby his reward - another caravan park holiday in Filey.
