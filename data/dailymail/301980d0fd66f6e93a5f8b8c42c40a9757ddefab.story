Two German tourists and an Australia have been plucked from their capsized boat, weak and desperate, after clinging to the vessel for two days and nights.

Coastguard officials in the Philippines said the three men, Germans Ralf Auer, 54, his son Thomas, 20 and Australian Joshua Marsh were picked up by a cargo ship which brought them ashore.

The men were treated for severe bruising and dehydration but were later allowed to leave hospital, shaken from their experience.

Destination: The trio were heading from Banton Island to nearby Marinduque Island, when the boat capsized in the Sibuyan Sea, in the central Philippines

A Filipino man who was piloting their small boat remains missing, feared drowned, after he set out to swim ashore to seek help when the vessel was knocked over by huge waves in the Sibuyan Sea.

The Germans and the Australia were spotted by a passing freighter as they clung to the outrigger of their capsized boat.

They were brought ashore at the central port of Iloilo and taken immediately to hospital ‘looking worse the wear,’ said Chief Petty Officer Venerando Celis of the Philippines customs service.

‘They were very weak after not eaten or drunk any fresh water for two days and two nights,’ said Mr Celis.

‘They have told us they were getting very worried that they might not be found. They were losing their strength and it is possible that if the freighter had not seen them they might have slipped away into the water and drowned.’

The drama occurred as the boat was attempting a 25-mile crossing to Marinduque island, where Ralf Auer’s Philippine wife comes from, said Mr Celis.
