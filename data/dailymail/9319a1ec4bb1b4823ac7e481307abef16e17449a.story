Travellers have said they will continue to fly with Malaysia Airlines despite the carrier's second catastrophic accident in four months.

The support for the airline came after flight MH17 crashed in rebel-held territory in eastern Ukraine on Thursday after apparently being struck by a surface-to-air missile.

All 298 passengers and crew on board, including nine Britons and 28 Australians, were killed.

Malaysia’s Minister of Transport today defended the decision by the pilots of the doomed flight MH17 to fly over the danger zone between the US and Russia.

Mr Liow Tiong Lai told a crowded press conference in Kuala Lumpur that the flight path taken by the Boeing 777 was approved by the International Civil Aviation Organisation and by those countries whose airspace the route passed through.

‘The International Air Transportation Association has also stated that the airspace the aircraft was traversing was unrestricted,’ Mr Liow said.

He pointed out that 15 of 16 airlines in the Association of Asia Pacific Airlines fly the route over Ukraine. He added that European airlines also use the same route.

‘In the hours before the incident, a number of other passenger aircraft from different carriers used the same route. There was no last minute instructions given to the pilots of MH17 to change the route of the flight.’

Mr Liow said that the latest breakdown of known nationalities on board was: 173 from the Netherlands, 44 Malaysians, 27 Australians, 12 Indonesians, nine from the UK, 4 Germans, four Belgians, three Filipinos, one Canadian, one New Zealander.

It follows the Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 disappearance in the Indian Ocean in March.

As news broke of the latest disaster, travellers were quick to stand by the airline on its official Facebook page.

Comments flooded in on the social media site - with supporters saying they wouldn't abandon the airline.

One said: 'I flew with Malaysian Airlines recently to Thailand and all I can say is they were amazing!!'

Another wrote: 'Loving the moonkite 
symbol symbol on tail fin of MAS, my next flights from the UK out to Far
 East will be with MAS, excellent airline, brilliant service, wonderful 
country, honest and gentle people, wishing them a heartfelt loss, my 
sincere loss for the people on MH17.'

Another Malaysian poster added: 'MAS - you will always be our beloved and preferred airline.'

While
 another wrote: 'Don't judge the airline, I would fly with them anytime.

'This plane has been shot down, sadly the airline will be criticised by 
some. Please get your facts right.

'RIP to those taken from their 
families. Very sad.'

Another
 added: 'Sad to hear of another fatal blow to a great Airline ... 
despite these 2 horrific events of late blame should not be turned back 
upon your organisation ... Stand tall and hold your head high ... I will
 be back soon to use your great service.' Another commenter wrote: 'Travelling 
with you guys next week from Auckland NZ to KL, to all crew stay strong 
our thoughts are again with you. see you on thursday.'

On Twitter, @ReeB73 said: 'Got to feel for #MalaysiaAirlines Such difficult times and then to be hit with this devastation.'

beats familiar friendly faces when you are away and the service is one 
of the best.'

However, some people demanded to know why the airline flew over disputed territory in Ukraine.

On
 Facebook, one poster called for the airline to be 'shut down', while 
another accused it of 'complete incompetence and lack of foresight'.

Malaysia Airlines flights to and from Sydney, Melbourne, Perth, Brisbane, Adelaide, Darwin and Auckland will operate as scheduled. 

However, the airline says all European flights will take alternative routes.

'With
 immediate effect, all European flights operated by Malaysia Airlines 
will be taking alternative routes avoiding the usual route,' it said.

Qantas
 and South Korea's two main airlines, Korean Air and Asiana, said they 
all re-routed flights from as early as the beginning of March when 
Russian troops moved into Crimea.

A Qantas spokesman said its London to Dubai service used to fly over Ukraine, but the route was changed 'several months ago'.

Malaysia Airlines has deployed a team of caregivers and volunteers to Amsterdam to assist family members of the deceased.

'The priority now is to get in contact with the next of kin and to take care of their wellbeing,' an airline spokesman said.

Malaysia Airlines is offering a refund for passengers who wish to postpone or cancel their travel plans.

'Malaysia Airlines deeply regrets the loss of MH17, and is very much appreciative of the support from our passengers,' the carrier said in a statement.
