Millions of cricket fans will never again trust what they see on the field because of the match-fixing scandal, a judge said yesterday.

Three corrupt Pakistan players were savaged for tainting cricket by taking bungs as part of a shadowy international gambling scam.

The men were told they had irrevocably damaged the name of a sport which was once a byword for ‘fair dealing’.

Mr Justice Cooke said former Test 
captain Salman Butt and bowlers Mohammed Asif and Mohammed Aamer 
betrayed legions of fans for greed. Jailing the men at Southwark Crown 
Court yesterday, he said people watching cricket will be ‘left to 
wonder’ whether surprising results were genuine.

Mr Justice Cooke said: ‘It is the 
insidious effect of your actions on professional cricket and the 
followers of it that make the offences so serious.

‘The image and integrity of what was 
once a game but is now a business is damaged in the eyes of all, 
including the many youngsters who regarded you as heroes and would have 
given their eye teeth to play at the levels and with the skills that you
 had.

‘You procured the bowling of three 
no-balls for money, to the detriment of your national cricket team, with
 the object of enabling others to cheat at gambling.

‘Now whenever people look back on a 
surprising event in a game or a surprising result, or whenever in the 
future there are surprising events or results, followers of the game 
will be left to wonder whether there has been fixing and whether what 
they have been watching is a genuine contest between bat and ball. What 
ought to be honest sporting competition may not be such at all.’

Struggle: Salman Butt had to fight his way through the media as he arrived at Southwark Crown Court and was given the heaviest sentence for his role in the scam

The three players were jailed 
alongside agent Mazhar Majeed, who was caught orchestrating the scandal 
in an undercover sting by the News of the World.

Mr Justice Cooke, yesterday

They agreed to bowl three no-balls at specified points during a Lord’s Test match last August in return for £150,000.

The jail sentences closed one chapter in an extraordinary scandal that has rocked the international game.

But questions remain over how far the 
corruption had spread and whether other Pakistan players were involved. 
Butt, 27, dubbed the ‘architect’ of the lucrative betting scam, was 
jailed for two and a half years just two days after his wife gave birth 
to a second son in Pakistan.

The world’s former No 2-ranked Test 
bowler Asif, 28, received a 12-month term. Aamer, 19, once tipped to 
become one of the all-time great fast bowlers, was jailed for six 
months.

Former Croydon Athletic FC owner 
Majeed, 36, who boasted he had made ‘masses and masses of money’, was 
jailed for two years and eight months.

He was secretly videoed counting huge sums of money and bragging that he could fix an entire Test match for a million dollars.

The four defendants sat impassively in
 a courtroom packed with journalists and cricket fans as they learned 
their fates. They will be released on licence after serving half their 
sentences and are almost certain to be deported.

Butt, Asif and Majeed were sent to 
Wandsworth prison in south-west London. Aamer, who is appealing his 
sentence, was sent to Feltham young offenders’ institution.

The judge said Butt was responsible for involving the ‘impressionable’ Aamer, then aged only 18.

He said: ‘It appears that the 
corruption may have been more widespread than the defendants here before
 me, and may have permeated the team in earlier days.

‘If that is the case, you, as captain,
 perpetuated such an atmosphere of corruption and would be responsible 
for it and for the desire to use Majeed and his contacts to make money 
for yourself and others in the team.’

All three players were banned from playing for five years by the International Cricket Council in February.

The Pakistan Cricket Board said the conviction of the players was ‘a sad day for Pakistan cricket’.
