A pair of procrastinators have come up with a shocking way to tackle their Facebook habits -  a keyboard device that electrocutes them when they spend too long on the site.

The Pavlov Poke gadget sits under the wrist of a computer user and monitors which sites and applications are used.

If the user is meant to be working, but keeps getting distracted by Facebook, for example, or spends too long chatting on forums, the device sends an electric shock.

Scroll down for video

Pavlov Poke, pictured, connects to a keyboard, monitors which sites are visited and gives users electric shocks when they procrastinate too much. It was created by doctorates from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who wanted to reduce the amount of time they spent on sites such as Facebook and Twitter

Pavlov Poke is made of an Arduino board - a board that can be used to develop applications and service - that sits under the wrist of a user.

The board is connected to a computer by USB.

Users must install application logging software that is designed to monitor and track which programs and sites are used.

The device connects to this software - the developers use the Apple Mac UI Inspector - and tracks usage.

If the users spend too long on a site, a warning message will appear on the screen.

If they continue to use it, the board will electrocute them.

It was developed by Ph.D students Robert R. Morris and Dan McDuff at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

A video explaining the concept of the device claimed the pair 'wasted 50 hours a week procrastinating online' and they needed a way of tackling this.

Pavlov Poke uses what McDuff calls 'counter-conditioning' techniques.

It was named after Ivan Pavlov, famous for developing the theory of conditioning in dogs to make them behave a certain way.

According to the video, the shock is unpleasant but it’s not dangerous.

The Poke device can then connect to this software and tracks usage.

If the users spend too long on a site, a warning message will appear on the screen. If they continue to use it, the board will electrocute them.

A Swedish study found that 70 per cent of people access Facebook as soon as the log onto their PCs, while 85 per cent admitted to using the site daily.

A quarter of people asked said they felt 'ill' if they didn't log on every day.

Research from the University of 
Chicago added that Facebook and Twitter are 'more addictive than 
cigarettes and alcohol.'

Morris and McDuff claim on their site: 'While this project is intended to be a joke, we believe a serious discussion is needed about how communication technologies are designed.

Technologies like Facebook are addictive by design. According to comScore, Facebook users spend an average of 400 minutes per month on the site.'

There is also a phone version that involves a stranger calling the user, rather than an electric shock, and shouting at them for their internet use.

Morris and McDuff have created the Pavlov Poke as a prototype and have no plans to sell it.
