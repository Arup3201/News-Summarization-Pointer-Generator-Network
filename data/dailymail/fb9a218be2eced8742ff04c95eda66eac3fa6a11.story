A series of stunning photographs show off the beauty of autumn in the Lake District as they capture the reflection of hills in the water.

The images were taken today during a moment of calm following a week of stormy weather across Britain.

However, despite the lush colours of autumn, temperatures were set to plunge as low as -3C, in a sign that winter is not too far away.

As well as the serenity of Lake Buttermere, the sun was today shining over the red leaves of Biddulph Grange in Staffordshire and the lime trees of Clumber Park in Staffordshire.

But joggers in Cleveland were pictured crunching through the frost on their morning run, with the icy ground reminding locals that Christmas is just seven weeks away.

After today's clear and dry conditions, showers are set to sweep across England tonight, according to the Met Office.

The rain will start moving over the South-West, before moving east and covering the whole country in showers by tomorrow.

Temperatures will fall across the country tonight, with London seeing highs of 5C and parts of northern England barely above freezing.

In Aberdeen, it is set to be as cold as -3C as winter starts to bite in Britain's extreme north.

Hilly regions such as the Pennines and the Scottish Highlands will suffer from the worst of the weather, a Met Office spokesman said, adding: 'There's a potential for showers to become rather wintry.'

For many, however, even the cold weather will be a relief compared to the storms which have raged over the past week.

In Blackpool a tourist was yesterday 
left fighting for his life after he was blown into the path of an 
oncoming taxi by gale-force winds.

The
man, thought to be in his 60s, was caught off balance by a huge gust, 
and stumbled into the road where he was hit by the vehicle.

Firefighters had to lift up the taxi to free the man who was trapped underneath it as 50mph winds raged in the town.

The victim was taken to a local hospital with critical injuries.

Last month was one of the warmest Octobers on record and the wettest in 13 years, according to Met Office figures.

Weather experts said balmy continental air was responsible for keeping temperatures more than 1.5C above average, making it the ninth warmest October since 1910.

However, the unseasonably mild conditions were kept up by a persistent layer of cloud, that brought so much rain with it it was also the wettest October for more than a decade.

Met Office spokesman Nicky Maxey, said: 'Temperatures for the month were well above average and it was - provisionally - the ninth warmest since 1910.

'The temperatures were well above by 1.7C degrees across the UK. The average temperature for the UK for the month is 9.49C - we had 11.2C.

'Many weather stations in Southern Scotland did not even record one night of air frost.

'The average temperature for England in October is 10.38C, but we had an average of 12.2C last month, according to intermediary data.

'There is still data to come in, not all weather stations are automated for various areas. These figures could change, but as it stands October is stacking up to be the ninth warmest on since 1910.'

Ms Maxey said rainfall was above normal for England, Wales and Northern Ireland, with provisional figures suggesting it was the wettest October since 2000.
