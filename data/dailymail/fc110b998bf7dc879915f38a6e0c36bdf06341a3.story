Do you find yourself in a bit of a mess when eating southern fried chicken? Or end up covered in pizza sauce when popping out for a slice? Well, help is at hand.

A South Korean inventor has created so-called 'finger condoms' designed to help foodies tuck into greasy and messy foods with ease.

The Finger Naps are described as 'disposable mini gloves' that can be attached to the index finger and thumb in order to eat oily and saucy foods like fried chicken, pizzas and doughnuts more easily.

Handy? A South Korean inventor has created 'finger condoms' called Finger Naps, mini gloves designed to help foodies tuck into greasy and messy foods with ease

A description on Alibaba, which is selling the quirky gloves for around £18 for a box of 500, says they help prevent bacteria spreading and are ideal for children and the elderly.

They advise wearers to use them when eating outside, applying ointment, eating snacks and when cleaning. 

What's more, the creator says that because the gloves are made of biodegradable plastic, his creation is an Eco-friendly one and apparently reduces the use of other disposable products.
