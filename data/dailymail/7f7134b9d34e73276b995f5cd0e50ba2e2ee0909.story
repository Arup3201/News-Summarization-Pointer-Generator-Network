A man killed the mother of his child and her two cousins then shot himself dead in front of police officers after handing a 13-month-old boy to them.

Brittany Mills, 28, had been trying to break off her relationship with John Louis Lynn, 41, when he came round to her home at Dye House Apartments, in the Hartford suburb of Manchester, Connecticut, on Saturday.

After growing concerned that Miss Mills wasn't answering her phone her two cousins Kamesha Mills, 23, and Artara Benson, 46, went round the the apartment to check on her.

But at 9.40pm police were called to the property after reports of multiple gunshots. 

As they arrived at the scene Lynn emerged from the building carrying the child, according to a statement by Manchester police Captain Christopher Davis.

During a brief confrontation with officers, he put down the boy before shooting himself, the officer said.

The child appeared to be unharmed but was taken to a hospital to be examined.

An officer also fired one shot at the man but apparently missed, Davis said.

Police then searched the building and found a gruesome scene. Brittany Mills had been shot multiple times while her cousins Kamesha and Artara were both killed with a single gunshot wound to the head.

A member of the Mills family told The Hartford Courant that Brittany had been trying to end her relationship with Lynn for two weeks but that he was ''over there all the time'', even though she ''tried to stop him coming''.

The couple were also involved in a child support dispute and Lynn had been ordered to pay support by a Superior Court judge. Brittany had also filed a contempt finding and wage garnishment against Lynn.

Mills' sister Tashua Parker said the couple had a strained relationship, but that it had not been violent. She said; ''It wasn't physical, we just never thought it would go this far.''

Killer: John Lynn shot dead his girlfriend and her two cousins before turning the gun on himself

When police arrived at the scene they
 had to force entry into the apartment and found all three women shot 
dead in the living room.

Captain Davis said that the prompt arrival of the police prevented Lynn from abducting his son after the triple homicide.

He
 said:: 'It should be noted that the officers' quick response to the 
scene prevented the suspect from being able to flee with the child and 
likely saved the child's life.'

Sandra Murray, a resident in the 
complex, said she was watching television when she was startled by what 
sounded like two gunshots. 

She looked out her window and saw police officers arriving. She said: 'It's sad. It's horrible this has happened. 

'Everyone is so sad around here, just trying to figure out what happened. You're just praying for the families.'

She said authorities removed the bodies from the apartment at about 6am yesterday.

The medical examiner determined that Lynn's death was a suicide while Brittany, Kamesha and Artara were all homicde victims.

The apartments are in a converted industrial mill complex about 10 miles east of Hartford, near Interstate 384.
