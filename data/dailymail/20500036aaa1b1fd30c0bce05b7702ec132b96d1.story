Former New York Rangers forward Sean Avery threw in his acting debut two days before the off-broadway show was set to open after having a 'complete meltdown' during rehearsals, according to reports.

Christy Smith-Sloman - author of the play, Negative is Positive - told Page Six that Avery - who was ousted from Dancing With The Stars earlier this year - stormed off set after being offered pizza by an assistant.

'It’s a complete horror story,' she told the column.

'Avery had a complete meltdown in rehearsals and quit.

'He pretty much snapped.'

'Breakdown': Sean Avery, 34, reportedly stormed off set of Negative is Positive on Tuesday. The show's playwright says he is no longer welcome in the production 

Debut: The play - set to open at Theater for the New City on Thursday - is seen here in rehearsals 

'Complete horror story': Avery was accused of being a 'madman' ahead of the show opening this week

Retired: Sean Avery stopped playing professional ice hockey in 2012

The show will open at Theater for the New City in the East Village on Thursday night.

The incident with Avery is said to have started on Monday, when he left rehearsals after becoming agitated, according to Page Six.

The issue escaled on Tuesday when the assistant stage manager asked Avery if he wanted some pizza.

A miscommunication occurred and Avery believed the woman had referred to him as an 'a--hole'.

Avery allegedly lost it at the woman, who was reduced to tears.

The director, Andreas Robertz, told the column Avery then left.

'I think something snapped in him,' Robertz said.

Smith-Sloman added that Avery is not welcome back.

'At this point I don’t want him to be a part of this production,' she said.

'He can’t call people pieces of s--- and say, ''Do you know who I am?''.(He) can’t threaten people.'

Avery has not commented on the incident at the theater.

Engaged: In November last year, Avery became engaged to Sports Illustrated model Hilary Rhoda. The couple are seen here in New York on July 24

He will be replaced by an understudy.

Negative is Positive is a comedy-drama about a newly-married interracial couple.

Avery was to play the pair's close friend. 

Avery retired from ice hockey in 2012 and began working at New York advertising agency Lipman.

Appearing on Dancing With The Stars earlier this year, Avery said at the time that his early exit from the show was the result of an argument with a producer.

'I had a conversation with Conrad (Green), one of the producers, and I was upset at the package that they had brought in the week previous, and it was a very tacky attempt to show me as the bad boy of DWTS,' Avery said on Good Morning America after leaving the show.

'And I think in reality TV or some sort of competition, if you have a disagreement with the producers, then generally that seals your fate quite early.'

Messing around: Prolific on social media, Avery is seen here in a photo from his Instagram

In November last year, Avery became engaged to Sports Illustrated model Hilary Rhoda.

The engagement came just a few months after tabloid reports that he was in a relationship with TV personality Andy Cohen, after they were photographed vacationing together in East Hampton.

The pair made light of the reports on social media, before Avery deleted his posts.
