It shows a hunched couple walking with the aid of a walking stick and is used to warn drivers to beware older people crossing the road.

But the government's tsar for the elderly says the road sign should be banned because they convey a message that older people are 'frail and disabled' and discourage employers from hiring someone over 50.

Dr Ros Altmann, the government's business champion for older workers, claims the 'elderly people' sign is discriminatory because it puts off employers.

She is planing to bring the issue to women and equalities minister Jo Swinson at a meeting next month, reported The Sunday Times.

Dr Altmann said the signs like the one for elderly people are 'colour stereotypes' and should be abolished.

She told MailOnline: 'I would like to see the signs banned - just drop them.

'I don't understand what purpose they serve - in this day and age, do we really need a say that says "Warning: old people"? It's not very helpful to anybody.

'It just feeds into the social stereotypes that suggest old people are disabled.

'It's one of those things that seeps into the national psyche and we don't think about it.'

She added: 'We have got an ageing population in this country. The vast majority are fit and healthy and in no way like that picture of people being stooped over and needing a walking stick.

'The signs give the message that old people are frail and disabled - it contributes to the some of the age discrimination that we know exists in society.

'They belong to a bygone era and I think there is merit in focusing people's attention on something that everybody recognises.' 

This week, at a meeting of employers, including Centrica and Barclays, she will reveal proposals to offer older people internships to help them start new careers.

She added she would like to see the government offer older works the same kind of job subsidies planned for young people.
