Clara Gantt waited more than 60 years for her husband to come home from the Korean War - she finally laid him to rest Saturday.

Army Sgt. 1st Class Joseph E. Gantt went missing in action during the Korean War, his remains were returned to his widow, now 94, and a funeral was held Saturday with full military honors.

The widow never wavered from her hopes that she would be reunited with her husband, she never remarried - and Saturday she stood there as his wife to receive the ceremonial flag that was draped over his casket.

Ms Gantt dedicated her life to honoring her husband.

'I was praying to the Lord,' she told CBS Los Angeles, 'to let me live to see the closure with my husband.'

'My husband was a wonderful man, he was a good husband,' she continued.

The emotional ceremony drew family, friends and veterans of other wars looking to pay respects to the decorated former soldier who died in 1951 as a result of malnutrition and a lack of medical care after being captured by Chinese forces, according to CBS Los Angeles.

'This is something very special, very, very unique,' Vietnam War vet Robert Hernandez told CBS Los Angeles. 'For this lady to have her husband come home, after 60 years of not knowing where he was at, this is just a special, special occasion.'

Despite having not seen her husband for such a long time, Ms Gantt fondly remembered him.

'I had a lovely time being a married woman,' she told CBS Los Angeles, adding that she wished the love of her life could have been brought home sooner.

The funeral came only one day after his remains were repatriated into the country, with Ms Gantt weeping as she stood in
 the cold before the flag-draped casket that was carried from a jetliner
 by military honor guard at Los Angeles International Airport.

'He told me if anything happened to him he wanted me to remarry. I told him no, no. Here I am, still his wife,' she said.

'I am very, very proud of him. He was a wonderful husband, an understanding man.

'I always did love my husband, we was two of one kind, we loved each other. And that made our marriage complete.'

Joseph Gantt was reported missing in action on November 30, 1950, while serving with Battery C, 503rd Field Artillery, 2nd Infantry Division, according to the Defense Prisoner of War/Missing Personnel Office in Washington, D.C.

According to the office, elements of the 2nd Infantry Division were attacked by greater numbers of Chinese forces near the town of Kunu-ri, North Korea.

The division disengaged and withdrew, fighting its way through a series of Chinese roadblocks.

Numerous U.S. soldiers were reported missing that day in the vicinity of Somindong, North Korea.

After a 1953 exchange of prisoners of 
war, returning U.S. soldiers reported that Gantt had been injured in 
battle, captured by Chinese forces and died in a POW camp in early 1951 
from malnutrition and lack of medical care.

His remains were only recently identified. Information on when they were found was not immediately available from the missing personnel office.

'Sixty-some odd years and just receiving his remains, coming home, was a blessing and I am so happy that I was living to accept him,' the devoted wife said.

Burial with full military honors is scheduled for December 28 in Inglewood.

Gantt joined the Army in 1942 and served in the South Pacific during World War II. He and Clara met on a train from Texas to Los Angeles and were married in June 1948. He was then sent to Korea as a field medic. The couple had no children.

Gantt was awarded the Bronze Star with Valor, a Purple Heart and other honors. Clara Gantt keeps the medals in her bedroom.

Nearly 7,900 Americans are still unaccounted for from the Korean War. According to the Defense Department, modern technology allows identifications to continue to be made from remains turned over by North Korea or recovered from that nation by American teams.

Bob Kurkjian, executive director of USO Greater Los Angeles Area, told the Los Angeles Times Gantt was the third Korean War veteran whose remains have been brought home in the last 18 months.

'Itâ€™s a holiday homecoming for the Gantt family to finally be able to close that chapter and move forward knowing with certainty that their husband, uncle, great uncle is finally home,' Kurkjian said.
