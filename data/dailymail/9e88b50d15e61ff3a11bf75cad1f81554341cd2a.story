Resentful: Deby Mejia had been caring for the girl since the child's mother was deported to Honduras in 2006

A 23-year-old woman allegedly whipped her younger sister with an extension cord before knocking the girl unconscious over a bag of Cheetos, police said.

The little girl had bought the snacks from a neighbour while sister Deby Mejia, 23, was out of the family's house in Houston, Texas.

The child, who has not been named, told police her sister had got 'real mad' when she returned home to find her snacking.

Mejia allegedly whipped the girl with an extension cord before grabbing her by the hair and banging her head on the floor, knocking her unconscious, investigators said.

Social services got involved after teachers noticed the girl had multiple bruises on her body and bump on her head.

She told doctors at the hospital that she had been dizzy for several days after the attack.

Mejia was arrested and is now in jail on a $60,000 bond.

She had been looking after the girl since the child's mother was deported to Honduras in 2006, according to the arrest warrant.

Investigators said she resents the child being born and told police she does not feel remorse for the brutal beating.

One of Mejia's neighbours, who did not wish to be named, told ABC13 News: 'I just can't believe she would do stuff like that," he said. "I'm telling you, she looks like a nice person.'
