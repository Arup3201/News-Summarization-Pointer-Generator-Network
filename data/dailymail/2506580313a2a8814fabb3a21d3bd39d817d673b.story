Bonnie Raygor was in the middle of cooking dinner yesterday when she went to open a bag of potatoes and found an unwanted ingredient inside: a 3 1/2-foot snake.

Raygor had purchased the bag of potatoes six days before at the Walmart in North Huntingdon, Pennsylvania - but hadn't opened the bag yet. That's when she came across the snake for the first time.

'First I saw it's underbelly, which is white. I thought I had a bad potato,' Raygor told WTAE. 'Instead I had a snake. The bag was sealed. The only thing that's in it are the little holes, so I'm assuming it was in there when I bought it. I screamed.'

Sealed in: Raygor hadn't opened the bag since she bought the potatoes six days prior, so she believes the snake was in there the whole time

Corn snake: Raygor believes that the snake is a corn snake after finding similar pictures of it on the internet. The snake is currently living in a reptile case the family had on hand from a former pet

After some research on the internet, Raygor believes that the snake is a corn snake.

'I'm hoping it's a corn snake, because I just stuck my hand in it and grabbed it.'

Raygor was able to put the snake in an old reptile enclosure the family had from a previous pet.

Since Raygor hadn't opened the bag at all since she bought the potatoes the previous Friday at Walmart, she assumes the snake must have been in there since she purchased it. The only openings in the bag were the tiny holes usually found on potato packaging.

Snug: The enormous 3 1/2-foot snake had somehow managed to fit in the potato bag packaging

Surprise snake: The first thing Raygor did when she found the snake was call Walmart. A manager said he could refund her potatoes if she had a valid receipt

The first thing that Raygor did when she discovered the snake was call Walmart.

'First they told me I should bring it to the lawn and garden department and they'd take care of it.'

Understandably dissatisfied, Raygor asked to speak to the manager.

'He said if I had a receipt, I could get a refund.'

Helpful: The Walmart in North Huntington first advised Raygor to bring the snake to the lawn and garden department, where they would take care of it

Walmart told WTAE that they plan on contacting the distributor of the Harvest Gold potatoes that Raygor bought, Irving Farms Marketing based in Maine.

'I think they need to find out where it came from. They owe me an apology.
