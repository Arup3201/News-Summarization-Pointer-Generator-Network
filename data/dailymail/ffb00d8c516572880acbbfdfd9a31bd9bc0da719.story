Britain's oldest barmaid is still pulling pints in her local, despite having just celebrated her 90th birthday.

Great-grandmother Joyce Leyshon has tallied up a remarkable 64 years of unbroken service in pubs and clubs - and has poured over three million drinks during that time.

Bubbly Joyce - who lives in Lincoln and beat breast cancer three times in the 1970s - started working in bars after the war when she served as a Wren in the Women's Royal Naval Service.

Pull the other one: Joyce Leyshon celebrated her 90th birthday last week but still has no plans to retire

For the past 10 years she has been behind the bar at The Crown Inn in Lincoln, where she marked her 90th birthday this week.

She
has also run a nightclub in Cyprus and bars at various RAF bases in 
England and Belgium where her late husband Ken was posted.

Joyce, who still enjoys a whisky and lemonade, has no intention of calling time on her career.

She
said: 'I love the work - if I won the Lottery tomorrow I'd go and buy a
pub. I love the atmosphere, mixing drinks for people and everything 
about pubs and socialising.

'It
keeps me in touch with the world and what's going on and it gets me out
of the house. I've been working here for 10 years and I'm still going 
strong - I have no plans to retire.

'In fact, I'm going to ask the landlord for a pay rise as I can't afford any new knickers at the moment.'

Widowed Joyce has a 64-year-old son, three grandchildren and eight great grandchildren - and a 77 year-old toyboy named Derek Rouse (corr).

She has spent most of her working life in Lincoln, with 25 years at the city's Joiners Arms and eight at the Duke of Wellington.

Crown Inn landlady Cindy Burn, 58, said: 'She helps me out when I'm poorly and we have a laugh together. She's like a mother to me. I love her.'

Landlord Bramwell Burn, 65, added: 'She's one of the loveliest ladies you could ever meet.

'She'll probably still be here in 30 years' time when I'm dead and buried.'

Regular Austin May, 50, said: 'It's always a great laugh to be in the pub when Joyce is behind the bar.

'She's just Joyce. She's always the same.'
