Nearly 60 per cent of Brits update their Facebook status 10 times while on holiday for a week – with most people wanting to brag about their trip.

More than 40 per cent said they had accessed Twitter four times, and more than two thirds admitted to sending an average of 23 texts while away.

The survey revealed 89 per cent of the 1,858 people questioned take their mobile phone abroad on holiday, 39 per cent opt for a tablet, 26 per cent an e-reader, and 11 per cent packed a laptop.

Addicted: Around 89 per cent of respondents admitted that they took their mobile phone abroad on holiday with them on their last trip

The top two reasons for using 
technology while abroad were wanting to stay in the loop with everything
 back home (41 per cent) and ‘to brag about my holiday’ as a close 
second (32 per cent).

The
 poll looked at social media usage and general digital consumption of 
holidaymakers whilst abroad and was carried out by www.sunshine.co.uk.

When
 asked how many times they had updated their Instagram account, if they 
had one, the average answer was twice over the course of the holiday.

Some
 46 per cent of the respondents said they had used Instagram while on 
holiday – posted photos at least twice while they are away.

And 51 per cent of the Britons taking part in the poll said that they accessed the internet every day during their holiday.

Showing off: The respondents who confessed to using gadgets said it was 'to stay in the loop' and 'to brag about my holiday'

Chris
 Clarkson, Managing Director of sunshine.co.uk, said: ‘Holidays should 
not be about updating your Facebook every five minutes or scrolling 
through your Twitter feed to see what’s happening in the office or back 
home.

‘Holidaymakers 
must get a little bit of distance between themselves and their gadgets; 
leaving them in the drawer at home is a good start!

‘Don’t
 get me wrong, an e-reader is a great addition to any holiday, but a 
constantly bleeping smartphone or a laptop feeding through a string of 
work-related emails is not!

‘Make
 the decision to leave most of your gadgets behind and you can just tell
 everyone how great your holiday was once you get home.

‘They don’t need a constant update about your holiday, as much as you’d love to brag about cocktail hour around the pool!’
