New Year’s Eve celebrations will be better dressed than usual at the Wings Stadium in Kalamazoo, Michigan, on Wednesday evening when the local hockey team take to the ice in tuxedo jerseys specially designed for the occasion.

The Kalamazoo Wings are hosting their 13th annual New Year's Eve Bash starting at 8 p.m. and to celebrate the special occasion the team will be wearing the dapper-looking tuxedo jerseys for the game against the Cincinnati Cyclones.

After the game fans will be welcome to skate on the ice and mingle with the players while there will also be a DJ as part of celebrations to ring in 2015 in style.

There will be other activities in the concourse, including a cornhole tournament and keg curling. One fan will also win pizza for a year.

On Saturday the East Coast Hockey League team enjoyed 2-1 victory over the Toledo Walleyes at Fifth Third Field in the league’s first ever outdoor game.

On Friday, January 2nd, the K-Wings and Cyclones will meet again on We Pay Your Bills Night. 

Hockey fans are encouraged to bring any of their bills (phone, credit card, etc) to the game and register for a chance to win $500 in cash.  

The tuxedo shirts are a dapper step up for the team who normally take to the ice in white with black bands
