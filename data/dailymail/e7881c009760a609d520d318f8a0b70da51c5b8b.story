Honey Boo Boo and her mother June were last seen bobbing for pigs' feet and scouring for donuts at their local auction.

Now, a new episode of the reality TV show Here Comes Honey Boo Boo has shown June doing what she does best - couponing.

In a teaser clip for Wednesday night's episode of the Toddlers & Tiaras spin-off series, Alana, aka Honey Boo Boo, her mother and her sister Pumpkin hit their local supermarket in McIntrye, Georgia where they redeem groceries using several wads of discount coupons.

June, who who was accused

 of 'doping' her daughter with caffeinated drinks and high 
sugar snacks in an episode of Toddlers & Tiaras in January, shares her adoration for couponing with the cameras.

'Oh, it's better than sex,' she says before rolling her eyes back in a pleasurable manner.

The coupon queen, as she is commonly referred to, continues: 'Couponing is a serious obsession. Anybody who uses coupons will tell you that it is an addiction.'

The family are seen filling up their shopping cart with 14 packets of chocolate milk powder and ten packages of ramen noodles in addition to a load of other groceries. The powder and noodles, however, work out to be free through the coupons.

'We just cleared that shelf,' Alana tells her mother as she watches the powder fall into the cart. Her mother proudly agrees.

June also spots mustard on the shelves and works out that she is able to save about 60cents per jar using the coupons.

'Couponing is a serious obsession. Anybody who uses coupons will tell you that it is an addiction'

'We're going to get two of them' she says.

Although she is seen struggling to calculate some of the more complicated savings, she adds that couponing is a pretty straight-forward activity.

'I taught myself so it's not that hard,' she says. 'It doesn't take a rocket scientist to coupon.'

She claims that there are some shoppers out there who are even more obsessed with the activity than she is.

'Someone went in there last week and said "I feel like I'm on crack,' she says. 'She's like at this 
shelf, goin' like, I'm like, what the...'

Genius: June is seen doing 'quick math' in order to calculate the saving she can make on jars of mustard

Fun for all: The youngster enjoys couponing with June because she can 'push the buggy around' the store

But couponing is not just for June.

Alana tells the camera: 'I like going couponing with my mom because I like to push the buggy around.'

Her older sister Lauryn, aka 12-year-old Pumpkin, on the other hand, fails to see the joy.

'Personally, I don't like couponing because of the fact my mama takes too long in the stores,' she says.

Although the six-year-old pageant star is supposed to be the star of TLC's new show, her outrageous family are no doubt stealing the limelight.

Last week's episode followed them as they visited their local Redneck Games where Pumpkin went bobbing for pigs' feet and Alana's other sister 'Chubbs' tried out mud belly flop diving.

Meanwhile, June, who has been hoarding a lot of camera attention over the show, was spotted grinding against a man in the previous episode.

During another scene, she was seen discount shopping at a local auction house.

She eyed off loads of discounted food including what looks 
to be multiple packets of sugary donuts in what she described as a 
'thrifty' way to shop - even though the entire family are supposed to be on a diet.

June explained that she shops this way in order to save money because her daughter's pageant 
dresses are 'so expensive'.

She was seen 
narrowing her eyes towards bargain-hunting competitors at the auction who were also keen to secure the sweets.

It seems that donuts are certainly an object of desire in this neck of the woods.

The mother told the camera: 'It [auction items] can be like half off of what you'd normally buy'.

She added: 'Pageants are very, very expensive. It is not a cheap sport by any means. Sometimes he has what I'm looking for, sometimes he don't.'

Alana then bought a pet pig which she named Glitzy and plans to take along to pageants with her.

The youngster's unruly antics helped her become the break-out star of Toddlers & Tiaras.

She and her mother even appeared on CNN last week as part of
 the series' extensive promotional run ahead of its debut.

June addressed the 
child pageant industry as a whole, claiming that it never aims to 
sexualise children, which is a common accusation among critics.

'If you're looking at my child in a sexual manner, there's not something wrong with me a parent,' she said.

Child star: Honey Boo Boo told the show's hosts that she prefers 'hair and make-up' to being a 'normal person'

The show's hosts also quizzed the star of the show but Alana simply reiterated her love of child pageants.

'It's fun, I like it,' she said. 'I feel like a pageant queen... I like hair and make-up more [than looking like a] normal person.'

'We are a redneck,' she exclaimed suddenly before regurgitating her catch cry: 'You better redneck-onise!'

Alana is almost incoherent as her speaking manner is so bizarre.

Other family members featured in the show include her chalk-miner father, Sugar Bear, and three sisters: Pumpkin, Jessica, aka 'Chubbs', 15, and pregnant 17-year-old Anna, known to the family as 'Chickadee'.

The clan were seen in an early trailer for the show squishing their flabby bellies around in one particularly charming scene.

One of the girls was seen telling the camera: 'We're not red-necks... we all have our teeth, don't we?'

Snippet from Alana's debut on Toddlers 
& Tiaras were also included in Here Comes Honey Boo Boo early on, including Alana's now famous exclamation: 
'A dollar makes me holler, Honey Boo Boo'.

A January episode of Toddlers & Tiaras saw June tell of how 
she created a 'Go Go Juice' mixture of Mountain Dew and Red Bull after 15 bags of Pixy Stix - tubes of powdered sugar often known as 'pageant 
crack' - failed 
to boost her daughter's energy.

Beauty pageant Insiders speculate that some mothers' 'special juice' blends may even contain alcohol.

June was filmed instructing Alana to take 'two big gulps' from an 
unlabelled bottle. Within seconds, the change was apparent and the 
pageant hopeful was seen rapidly swinging her arms over her head and 
spinning around on the floor, exclaiming: 'My go-go juice is kicking in 
right now!'

Describing how 
the drink made her feel, she said: 'Go-go juice makes me laughy, and 
play-ey, and makes me feel like I want to pull my mommy's hair.

Energy boost: June was accused of 'doping' her daughter with the high-caffeine mixture

Hyper: Moments after having her 'special drink' Alana was filmed spinning on her stomach

But she is not entirely enthusiastic about the experience. She was seen telling the cameras: 'Beauty is so boring, I don't want to do it.'

June's enthusiasm is more than evident though. As her daughter takes
 to the stage, she was filmed yelling encouragement and instructing 
dance moves.

When she is not
 accompanying her daughter on the pageant circuit, June says she spends 
her time collecting those money-saving coupons and stockpiling hundreds of 
household products - a pursuit her daughter claims she wants to follow.
