This is the moment a double-bass player jumped around on stage with his Emmerdale actor bandmate despite claiming £56,000 in disability benefits because he ‘couldn’t walk 10 yards’.

David Ballantyne, 60, from Huddersfield, West Yorkshire, was receiving regular disability allowance after claiming he couldn’t work and had difficulty walking 10 to 15 yards following a knee injury. He also claimed he had pain in his neck and shoulders.

However, he was found to be cheating the system when he was caught on camera jumping around on stage with his band Chuck Wagon and playing his double-bass with such ‘exuberance and enthusiasm’ it even saw him stand on the side of it.

Miles Barker, prosecuting, told Leeds Crown Court yesterday that his performances in 2012 were a real eye opener and said Ballantyne, who used the false name of David Roberts, played in a way that ‘clearly belied his incapacity statement'.

Ballantyne was caught on stage with the ‘rock'n'roll band’, which included former Emmerdale and Birds of a Feather actor Alun Lewis, after being put under surveillance.

Mr Barker told the court that a number of diaries, seized at the house where Ballantyne was living in Huddersfield, revealed that the trio had been rehearsing regularly and doing gigs across the country - even as far away from Huddersfield as Somerset.

They also showed that Ballantyne had been doing IT work for individuals and companies and had helped a neighbour put up scaffolding and decorate his home, despite claiming he couldn’t work.

In addition to his employment lies, he
 also pretended he was a tenant at the house where he lived with his 
former partner and daughter so that housing benefit was paid by Kirklees
 Council.

In total, he 
received £25,498 in income support, £17,797 in housing benefit and 
£12,828 in disability living allowance - a total of £56,124 to which he 
was not entitled.

He falsely claimed income support and housing benefit from 2006 to 2012, and dishonestly claimed disability living allowance for a five-year period between September 5 2007 and September 4 2012.

Ballantyne (pictured left while playing  in 2012) admitted four charges of making false representations for benefit or failing to notify a change in circumstance and was jailed for one year at Leeds Crown Court

He was exposed following the joint investigation by Kirklees Council and the Department of Work and Pensions.

Michael Sisson-Pell, representing Ballantyne, said he had genuinely been injured and unable to work for some years so his disability claim was not fraudulent from the outset.

But, Mr Sisson-Pell said the defendant accepted his condition had improved and he knew he should have notified the department.

The defence lawyer also told the court how the trio had mainly played in the Huddersfield area and, after paying agents’ fees and petrol, usually received about £70 each per gig.

He said Ballantyne had become homeless in 2006 and moved back to his former partner’s home. They had not resumed a sexual relationship but he accepted he lived as a family.

‘It was a distinction that was lost on him,’ said Mr Sisson-Pell.

Ballantyne admitted four charges of making false representations for benefit or failing to notify a change in circumstance and was jailed for 12 months by recorder Tim Hirst who said he had failed to disclose the truth about his improving condition.

Denise Denman, 49, Ballantyne’s former partner, previously had charges of conspiracy to defraud the council against her dropped.
