For most people, having a shower and sponging off is an easy task - but it sends Jackie Wrights's heart racing.

The mother-of-four suffers from Trypophobia, a fear of holes which means even the thought of holding a sponge sends shivers down her spine - and she is forced to flee the shower if she spots any bubbles floating in the plug hole.

Her terror is so real she quit her job in a school kitchen because as soon as she saw a cluster of holes - in crumpets, the bottom of mushrooms or the inside of peppers - she would have a panic attack.

Jackie Wright, 45, from Wallsend, Newcastle-Upon-Tyne suffers from Trypophobia - a fear of holes. Even sponging off in the shower brings her out in a cold sweat

Even having a cup of tea brings her out in a cold sweat.

She said: ‘If I see any bubbles in my tea, I have to stir them out with a spoon or I have to drink with my eyes closed.’

Jackie, who now works as a part time check out assistant, said: ‘I’m worried that insects will crawl out of the holes, especially in the sponges. It’s not the holes themselves that frighten me, but rather what’s inside them.

Jackie Wright, 45, had to quit her job in a kitchen because the holes in food like crumpets and peppers gave her panic attacks

‘My life was turned upside down. I was in tears and started to think I was going to break down every time I saw something that triggered me.’

The nightmare first began three years ago, after Jackie, from Wallsend, Newcastle-Upon-Tyne, watched an advert for Sanex shower gel on TV.

She said: ‘I hated it when the camera would pan out from the naked people on the screen and merge into the pores of someone’s skin.

‘As soon as I saw it, my skin would crawl and after that, as soon as I heard the voice over for the advert I had to turn over to another channel.’

Her world was turned upside down.

She said: ‘There were loads of things I was fine with, and then suddenly I just couldn’t bear them.

‘When I suffered an episode at work, I felt like I was going to pass out and I’d be on the verge of tears.

‘It
 would start with a tingle in my head, which made me want to rip my hair
 out then I would break out in goosebumps all over my body and I’d want 
to rip my skin off.’

Jackie suffered in silence, until one day at work in the school kitchens, she had a breakdown.

The final straw came when her colleague was making a pizza and unaware of her phobia, she showed her the holey base.

Jackie
 said: ‘She had no idea about my phobia, but was telling me how she 
didn’t like the patterns herself. I started crying and had an anxiety 
attack, it was horrible. My heart was racing and I had to sit in the 
office to calm down.

‘I realised that I couldn’t carry on like this so I quit my job a month later.’

Jackie researched her symptoms on the internet and discovered that her bizarre fear was in fact a phobia of holes.

But doctors do not recognise the phobia, and Jackie wants sufferers to be taken seriously.

She
 said: ‘Not many people understand, so I am very careful who I tell 
about my phobia. I have told some friends and family and they were 
supportive but it was still embarrassing. I just don’t want people to 
think I’m mad.’

But her phobia does have one plus point – she doesn’t have to do the washing up.

But Jackie's phobia does have one 'silver lining' - she doesn't have to do the washing-up because her husband David, 46, (pictured) does it

Trypophobia is fear, revulsion or disgust of objects with irregular patterns of holes.

British academics Arnold Wilkins and Geoff Cole, who claim to be the first to scientifically investigate trypophobia, believe the reaction to be based on a biological revulsion, rather than a learned cultural fear.

They found that holes in skin, meat, wood, plants, coral, sponges, mould, dried seed pods, honeycomb, soap, cheese, soil, plants, wounds, bubbles, waffles, speakers caused sufferers distress.

Their study in journal  Psychological Science also found some people think that something might be living inside holes and are afraid that they might fall in the holes.

Cole and Wilkins concluded that Trypophobia triggers a fear of danger.

The holes, or images of holes, stimulate 'a primitive portion of his or her brain that associates the image with something dangerous.'

Jackie, who lives with husband David, 46, and children Rachael, 22, Connor, 20, Sofie, 14, and Caitlin, 12, said: ‘It’s the only silver lining of the phobia.’

And now she has started to face her fears and is receiving Cognitive Behavioural Therapy to help her cope with anxiety.

During the therapy she has to pop bubbles and is forced to use the objects she fears most - sponges and crumpets.

Trypophobia has been investigated by Dr Geoff Cole, a lecturer in vision science at the University of Essex.

Dr Cole believes everyone has the phobia to a certain degree.

He said: ‘Trypophobia is the most common phobia you’ve never heard of. We estimate that around 16 percent of the population is Trypophobic but we think that everybody has it to a certain degree.’

And Dr Cole has his own theory as to why people are so embarrassed to disclose their fear to their loved ones.

‘As the phobia isn’t officially recognised, people think they are the only ones to suffer from it.

Thankfully the internet is raising awareness and we hope that with more publicity we can get the condition recognised.’
