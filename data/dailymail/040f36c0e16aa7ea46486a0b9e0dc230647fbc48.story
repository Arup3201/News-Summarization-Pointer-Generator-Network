They say breakfast is the most important meal of the day and for this family sharing it with their pet camel is a no-brainer.

Joe, a six-year-old Bactrian camel visits the Anderson-Dixon family's home every morning, and enjoys munching his way through carrots and bananas on the breakfast table.

While Nathan, 34 and wife Charlotte, 31, who live on a farm in Stow, Staffordshire attempt to have a nice civilised breakfast with their two sons, Reuben, 3 and Beau, 2, the family barely have the chance to sit down before Joe pokes his head through the window and helps himself.

Joe, who stands at 5.83 feet is not particularly picky and will happily chow down on bread, cereal and fruit, but does turn his nose up at cheese.

Although Joe lives with three other female camels, he is the only one lucky enough to share breakfast with his owners.

The others have to eat hay, barley, straw and corn mix in their stable.

Mr Anderson-Dixon, said: 'The first time Joe joined us for breakfast he was uninvited.'He leaned in and rudely helped himself to the fruit bowl. But I wasn’t surprised because he’s very good at persuading all the other animals to give him their food too.”

'Now he comes over whenever he feels like it and hovers around in anticipation.

Mr Anderson-Dixon admits that Joe is his favourite pet. The couple look after and train 74 other creatures which are used in TV, films and commercials

'He is eating us out of house and home, but we can’t get angry at him. He is like a big soft giant teddy bear and has become part of the family.'

Although the family have gotten used to Joe’s freeloading, the family were initially frustrated at first with his lack of table manners.

Mr Anderson-Dixon said: 'Despite his regular visits, Joe hasn’t mastered a knife and fork yet.

'He is a messy eater, and the mess he leaves takes ages to clean up. He has no table manners.'

The couple run The Animal Company, a business that supplies animals to big events, commercials, film and TV shows.

Joe is their star worker and has appeared in camel races, commercials and events around the country. He has even starred in a desert scene for a famous hair brand.

Mr Anderson-Dixon admits Joe is his favourite and has even bought Joe his own lorry so he can be transported in style.

But their relationship hasn’t always been a good one.

At first, when he brought Joe back from Russia as a calf, training him to follow commands was a tough job.

It took 12 months to teach Joe how to follow instructions and Mr Anderson-Dixon had to quickly learn to dive out of the way when a ball of spit was aiming for his face.

He said: 'Joe needed to get used to having a head collar on him, we used food to train him and this worked well. The hardest part was to teach him how to cush (kneel down).

'He spat at me most of the time showering we with camel dribble and regurgitated food. It wasn’t the most pleasant of things, but I don’t blame him for doing it. If camels are stressed or agitated then they will spit at you.'

Luckily for the family, Joe doesn’t spit anymore and is the best behaved animal on the farm.
