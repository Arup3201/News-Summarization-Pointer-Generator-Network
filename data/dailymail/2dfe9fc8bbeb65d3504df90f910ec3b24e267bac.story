David Gill will become the most powerful administrator in English football when he is elected onto the FIFA ExCo at the UEFA Congress in Vienna.

He is a certainty to be the landslide choice of the 54 UEFA voting territories to succeed Northern Ireland's Jim Boyce, despite rival FA of Wales president Trefor Lloyd-Hughes claiming the FA have reneged on a signed agreement that it was the Welsh turn.

Gill's FIFA seat as the British vice-president will give him unprecedented football influence added to his other roles on the UEFA ExCo, FA vice-chairman, Premier League representative on the FA and Manchester United director.

David Gill is widely expected to succeed Jim Boyce as FIFA's British vice-president on Tuesday 

Gill has been backed by FA Chairman Greg Dyke to ensure ethics and transparency in the organisation

And FA chairman Greg Dyke, one of those along with UEFA chief Michel Platini who persuaded Gill to change his mind about working for a Sepp Blatter-led FIFA, wants urbane accountant Gill to be 'awkward' and stir up trouble in Zurich by asking hard questions of the FIFA president during his likely fifth term of office.

Dyke said: 'David will do the job properly. FIFA needs to have someone from the awkward squad asking tough questions. There is a feeling there have been too many acolytes and not enough people ensuring decisions are taken in a transparent, ethical and business-like manner.'

England rugby head coach Stuart Lancaster will head for a poolside bar with a beer or just lie in a darkened room when he goes on holiday to Tenerife this week to reflect on the agonising near miss in the Six Nations and plan for the World Cup. 'It's just a bit of space to get my head straight before I dive back into everything,' he said. Lancaster always travels to the same destination on Tenerife for his private thinking time after major tournaments, which his wife Nina describes as going into his 'cave'. Daughter Sophie reacted to Lancaster dining alone in a restaurant in Tenerife by calling him 'weirdo' in a text message. Lancaster wouldn't give his exact holiday location when asked, saying: 'I'm not going to tell you where it is in case you start following me around.' But his chances of escaping attention from British hordes in the Canary Islands are slim.

England fell one try short of a first Six Nations title since 2011 after their 55-35 victory over France

Twickenham charging £41 for wheelchair access to England matches, as revealed by Sports Agenda, has caused so much upset following long established free entry, the issue is going to be looked at by the international ticket committee as well as the RFU board and council. RFU staff are said to have implemented the new cost without first going through the ticketing committee.

BBC and BT rugby pundit Matt Dawson chose to tweet a picture of Twickenham personnel rehearsing podium preparation for a Six Nations presentation to 'champions' England before the French match. The image, which provoked the arrogant England stereotype, was soon deleted.

When Saracens announced the departure last Friday evening of Ed Griffiths, stand-out chief executive in English rugby for the past seven years, it looked a classic case of media-savvy Griffiths burying bad news on the eve of the Six Nations. However, it has emerged that highly-talented Griffiths is not leaving of his own accord. His exit is understood to be more to do with a breakdown of relationships with other powerbrokers at the club than alleged salary cap breaches. Griffiths was reported to be leaving at the end of the season but has ceased day-to-day work.

Broadcaster John Inverdale should be relieved his c-word slip of the tongue — 'rose-****** glasses' — while presenting Radio 5 Live's Cheltenham coverage hasn't cost him his prime role anchoring ITV's broadcast of the Rugby World Cup, an event more anticipated after such an epic finale to the Six Nations.

The European Club Association, having agreed a much improved financial deal with FIFA for club payments when releasing players for the 2018 and 2022 World Cup, have demonstrated they want their status to rise accordingly. They have hired sport strategist Jon Tibbs's PR company JTA, who also work for Manchester United, to represent them.
