The world's fattest sausage dog weighing a staggering five and a half stone has been put on a drastic diet to try and get him back into shape.

Overweight Obie, who is double the size of an average Dachshund, was nearly fed to death by his doting elderly owners who had to give him up because of their deteriorating health.

Vet Nora Vanetta heard about his condition and has now taken him in determined help him lose weight.

Big boy: At 77 lbs - Obie was the world's fattest Dachshund

Too many sausages: Obie, who was overfed by his doting elderly owners and became too fat to do any exercise

Ms Vanetta, from Portland in Oregon, U.S., couldn't believe a sausage dog could reach that size and originally assumed they'd got confused about his breed.

A Dachshund normally has a maximum weight of 32 pounds - a little over two stone - with Obie more than twice the size at the age of just five.

She said: 'Well, he arrived on August 18 and to my astonishment he was a dachshund and he actually weighed 77 lbs.

'He is extremely sweet and loving. He was obviously loved and is a joy to work with. The ageing owners just couldn't say no to those big brown eyes.

Counting calories: As Obie is too big to exercise, he has been put on a special diet and hydrotherapy regime

'But we are thrilled to be able to help him, and now moving on with his new life.'

Nora,
 who has a degree in animal science and is a certified veterinary 
technician, now has the difficult task of getting Obie into shape.

But because of his staggering weight, she is unable to take him out for exercise and has resorted to a special diet and hydrotherapy in an attempt to shed the pounds.

Obie now has his own Facebook page - 'Biggest Loser, Doxie Edition' - which documents the obese animal's weight loss regime.

It is hoped the sausage dog can lose around 40 lbs to get his weight to between 30 and 40 lbs.

Nora wants her two other dogs - a nine-year-old Labrador and five-year-old Dachshund - to be good role models for Obie

She has also set up a Paypal page to encourage people to donate money to pay for his continued care.

Nora added: 'I feel tremendously blessed to be involved in his rehabilitation and I am amazed at the outpouring of love and support that I have received.

'My hope is that he can be an inspiration to any person or animal trying to lose weight.

'It is so important to introduce pups and kids to a healthy lifestyle and food choices as early as possible.'
