Jack Alexander of the popular musical act The Alexander Brothers has died at the age of 77.

The Scottish folk legend, who performed across the world with his brother Tom, died peacefully at 1.40pm yesterday surrounded by his family, according to an official statement.

He was being treated at Ayrshire Hospice in Ayr after suffering a massive stroke last month.

The brothers, originally from Cambusnethan in Wishaw, Lanarkshire, were among Scotland's best-loved entertainers.

They performed to fans around the world for more than 50 years.

In the 1950s, they started performing on stage in a series of talent contests across central Scotland.

Jack was an accomplished piano player, while 79-year-old Tom favoured the accordion.

They won every competition they entered between 1950 and 1956, according to their fan club biography.

The duo then decided to play professionally - taking to the stage at Webster Theatre in Arbroath in 1958.

They recorded more than 30 albums - the 
first titled Highland Fling - and toured Canada, the United States, 
Australia and New Zealand.

They retired last year - following an impressive 54-year career - because Jack's health was failing.Â 

Both brothers were awarded MBEs for services to entertainment in the 2005 New Year Honours List.

Mr Alexander's family have asked for privacy at this time.
