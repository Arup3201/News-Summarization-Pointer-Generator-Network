Polygamy might be illegal in Britain but that hasn't stopped Phillip Sharp, 53, dubbed the 'Rampant Rabbi', from pursuing his unusual take on family life.

With him, on his East Sussex farm, live his five wives, their 18 children and, overseeing it all, Sharp's mother-in-law, Maureen. 

Sharp, who is known for his controversial views - among them 'all women need a husband', 'some gay people have demons in them' and 'black people have low self-worth' -  looks set to raise a few more eyebrows when a documentary that focuses on the life of his 10-year-old daughter Ellie is screened this week.

Unusual: 10-year-old Ellie Sharp is growing up in a polygamous family on a farm in East Sussex

Filmed in the weeks leading up to the defection of two of Sharp's 'wives' - he once had seven - the documentary charts Ellie's communal home life, which includes home schooling with Sharp's Austrian spouse, Hannah, and spending time with all five wives.

She even has nicknames for her mothers. Judith, 53, is known as 'Everything Mum', while her biological mother Margo, 42, is referred to as 'Yard Mum' because she looks after the family's horses.

'Daddy had a vision and God told him to have seven wives,' explains fresh-faced Ellie. 'I couldn't bear not living with all my mummies.'

Although he refers to them as 'wives', Sharp is not technically married to any of the women but they have all taken vows and do wear wedding rings.

Sharp's unusual family began after he separated from his legal wife 15 years ago. He began a relationship with Judith, and shortly after, came his heavenly vision.

His harem swiftly expanded to include his former nanny, New Zealander Margo, plus Swiss Vreni, 41, Hannah, 54, Chava, 67, Tracey, 45 and Karyn, 32. Between them, they have 18 children with Sharp, all of whom live according to his often bizarre decisions.

One that is likely to prove particularly controversial was his decision to take the three-month-old Ellie from her mother, Margo, and hand her to Judith to raise.

'When I was three months old, daddy decided that Judith should look after me instead of Margo,' says Ellie.

When asked why by documentary makers, Margo says: 'It was clear that I didn't have the ability to look after you. Judith stepped in and that was a good thing. It's made me better in lots of ways.'

As she finishes speaking, her lip quivers and she promptly bursts into tears.

Sharp, meanwhile, has his own controversial take on the issue.

'Margo had a very strong anti-men attitude and it was so strong that it was in Ellie,' he says. 'Ellie did not like me and rejected me.

'The witchcraft of women annihilates children's love and respect for their fathers.'

Although Sharp's domineering behaviour has already led to 'wives' Tracey and Karyn leaving the family, it has made no impression on his daughter, who describes him as 'awesome'.

Ellie can even see herself replicating the unusual set-up when she grows up. 'I've told my dad that in my future I wouldn't mind having a man with seven wives,' she says. 'I've grown up like that.'

The Girl With Seven Mums is on Thursday at 9pm on Channel 5
