The season 13 premier of Family Guy had a plotline that millions of fans have been waiting years for--the Griffins finally met Fox's other venerable cartoon family, The Simpsons.

The hour-long episode saw the Griffins of Family Guy stranded in Springfield, where their friendly rivalry was placed at center stage and won Family Guys its biggest premier ratings in four years.

But did the long-awaited television event satisfy fans? 

In the words of Chris Griffin: 'Yay...a crossover always brings out the best in each show. It never smacks of desperation, the priorities are always creative and not driven by marketing.'

Finally: The Simpsons and the Griffins of Family Guy fame finally met in a crossover episode many have been waiting all of Family Guy's 13-plus years for

To be fair to Family Guy creator Seth McFarlane, The Simpsons on their season debut the same night chose to kill off a character and, after months of marketing the opener, chose a minor player to knock off.

That disappointing ratings grab is certain to leave more fans with a bitter taste in their mouths than the Family Guy episode, which gave Seth McFarlane's series its biggest ratings in four years, reports Mashable.

It also handlily beat out all other shows of the night, even after a internet firestorm that raged last week after news leaked that the episode would contain a tasteless rape joke.

The joke punctuates a scene in which the incorrigible Bart is instructing Stewie Griffin in the art of the prank phone call. Bart dials the owner of Moe's Tavern and asks whether there is anyone there with the last name Keybum, first name Lee. When Moe calls out to his patrons, asking for a 'leaky bum,' everyone gets a laugh.

Beer drinkers: Homer and Peter spar over which beer is better -- the Duff of Springfield or Quahog's finest, Pawtucket Patriot Ale

Barbs: Marge and Lois have trouble hitting it off in the episode, and Marge even tells Lois to wear a bra next time she comes over

Stewie thinks that's cool, and asks to make his own prank call.

'Hello, Moe?' he says. 'Your sister's being raped.'

Other interactions were less charged.

Lisa Simpson and Meg Griffin strike up a friendship that leads sometimes-confident Lisa to take always pitiful Meg under her wing for a little ego-building.

Marge and Lois also strike up an acquaintance, though not one as constructive as their daughters.'

Stewie and Bart bond over weapons and hyper-intelligent Griffin dog Brian is forced to make friends with the Simpson's regular dog, Santa's Little Helper.
