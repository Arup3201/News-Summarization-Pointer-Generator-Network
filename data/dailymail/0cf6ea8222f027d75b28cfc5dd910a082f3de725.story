An exhilarating stunt video has now become a tribute to a renowned international pilot

Daring dirt bike rider Nick De Wit performs an outrageous and perfectly judged backflip over an aircraft in a memorable stunt.

Under Over was a stunt which was completed by biker Nick De Wit and pilot Glen Dell from a remote airstrip in the North West bushveld of South Africa. 

Flying low: Pilot Glen takes off in preparation for the memorable stunt

The memorable stunt after was the culmination of two years of detailed planning when it was filmed in September 2013.

Mr De Wit and Mr Dell are seen in the video discussing the various elements of the stunt as they prepare to attempt the dangerous trick.

Timing: Mr Dell had to perfectly judge his timing as he prepared to fly under the ramp

Airborne: Bike rider Nick De Wit takes flight after he builds up speed on the bike ramp

The biker speeds up a ramp while the aircraft is being flown at a low height and then he flips backwards with incredible speed and precision to lift himself over the plane.

Moments later the South African duo are seen happily congratulating each other and giving each other a high-five after they successfully complete the manoeuvre.

Sadly Mr Dell, who won eight South African titles and claimed the Advanced World Aerobatic Champion in 2004, died tragically five weeks later on October 12, 2013.

The experienced pilot had an aviation legacy that spanned 30 years with 25,000 hours of flying experience in over 250 types of aircraft when he was fatally injured at a Secunda airshow.

Finale: Mr De Wit prepares to complete the stunt as Mr Dell lands the plane

Mr Dell had a renowned ability to perform aerobatics manoeuvres which made him one of the finest South African display pilots.

In recent years Mr Dell he had performed more frequently at exclusive events such as the Absa Cape Epic mountain bike race and Top Gear Live festival rather than airshows and competitions.

The 51 year-old was also very committed to working on speciality projects such as Under Over which will now be a lasting legacy to his remarkable aviation career.
