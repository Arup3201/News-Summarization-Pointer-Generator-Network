Theory: More than 150 years after Charles Darwin noted that animals were tamer on his beloved Galapagos Islands, his theory has been proved right by scientists

More than 150 years after Charles Darwin noted that animals were tamer on his beloved Galapagos Islands, his theory has been proved right by scientists.

The celebrated naturalist and geologist had casually observed that island animals often appeared tame, and questioned if they had evolved in that way after inhabiting areas without many predators.

The idea was an off-shoot of Darwin's evolutionary theories regarding natural selection, in which animals would change, and eventually become better suited to their environment over subsequent generations.

Now, 183 years after Darwin embarked on his voyage on HMS Beagle, which took him to the Galapagos, off the coast of Ecuador, a team of scientists have proven that island lizards are in fact 'tame', compared with their mainland cousins.

The researchers from the University of California, Riverside, Indiana University Purdue University Fort Wayne and George Washington University found that they were able to approach island lizards and get far closer to them then they could mainland lizards.

'Our study confirms Darwin's 
observations and numerous anecdotal reports of island tameness,' 
Theodore Garland, from University of California Riverside told Phys.org.

'His insights have once again proven to be correct, and remain an important source of inspiration for present-day biologists.'

As part of the research, which will appear in the Proceedings
 of the Royal Society B next month, the experts analysed the correlation
 between flight initiation distance - the moment in which a predator's 
prey starts to flee, distance from the mainland, island area and 
activities of 66 different species of lizards.

Can't be tamed: Scientists have found that mainland lizards, such as this desert iguana in Mexico, appear less 'tame' than their island cousins

Studies focussed on lizards from five continents and islands in the Atlantic
 and Pacific Oceans, and the Caribbean and Mediterranean Seas, with the 
results revealing that the flight initiation distance decreased as the 
distance from the mainland increased.

Professor
 Garland said that the escape responses are lessened on remote islands 
because there are fewer predators, so natural selection favours animals 
that do not need to flee.

The
 team also discovered that the size of the prey can affect its escape 
behaviour, as when animals are very small compared to their predators 
they are not attacked individually.

'This results in the absence of fleeing or very short flight initiation distance,' said Professor Garland.
