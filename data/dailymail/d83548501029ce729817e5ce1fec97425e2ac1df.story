The Queen may be forced to appoint an Australian-style ‘governor general’ to rule in her name in Scotland if the country votes for independence next month, it has been claimed.

Constitutional experts fear independence could throw up divided loyalties for the Queen if there was a clash between Scotland and the rump-UK in the future.

One solution would be to appoint a ‘governor general’ in Edinburgh to act in the Queen’s name. This could lead Scotland to eventually ditching the Royal family and becoming a republic within the European Union, claim experts.

The Queen - inspecting the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders at the gates to Balmoral earlier this month - may have divided loyalties if Scotland voted for independence

Latest polls show support for independence has grown from 39 per cent to 43 per cent in a month, with just four weeks before the historic September 18 referendum

Sir Peter Cosgrove was sworn in as Australia’s twenty sixth Governor-General in March this year.

The retired senior army officer represents the Queen in Australia and is the Commander-in-Chief of the country’s Defence Force.

In the day-to-day running of the country the Governor-General acts as the country’s head of state and is appointed by The Queen on the advice of the Australian Prime Minister.

Like the Queen in the UK, the Governor-General has the power to appoint a Prime Minister if an election has resulted in a ‘hung parliament’.

He also has the power to dismiss a Prime Minister where he or she has lost the confidence of the Parliament.

The claim comes as a new poll shows rising support for independence with just a month to go before the referendum on September 18.

A YouGov poll for the Times puts support for independence at 43 per cent, with 57 per cent backing the Union, once undecided voters are taken out.

Earlier this month just 39 per cent said they were preparing to vote Yes - with 61 per cent for No.

Scottish Nationalist leader Alex Salmond has insisted that the Queen will remain head of state in an independent Scotland.

But his party is split on the issue. The SNP’s John Mason yesterday called for a referendum to replace the Queen as head of state in Scotland.

He said: ‘The present queen is very popular, but the mood of society may change when she leaves the throne.’

Scotland Justice Secretary Kenny MacAskill has also raised the prospect this year of a referendum on the Royals. He said it was ‘for the people of Scotland to decide’ on the Queen’s role.

However, Robert Blackburn, professor of constitutional law at King’s College London, said the Queen may need to change her role if the UK split.

He said: ‘Politically, the Queen could find herself in difficulties if she received contradictory advice on her royal duties or public utterances on matters of common interest, particularly in foreign or diplomatic matters, where the British and Scottish governments might happen to be at loggerheads.

‘One solution would be to establish an office of governor-general in Edinburgh to act in the Queen’s name.’

Stephen Haseler, director of the Global Policy Institute in London, added: ‘Alex Salmond has overcome the issue of the monarchy initially by saying “Look, we will keep the Queen”.'

But Mr Haseler added: 'But of course the Queen won’t be around for very long, and my absolute conviction is that once the Queen goes the Scots won’t wear Prince Charles, and they will go for a republican system within the European Union.’

The Queen has not intervened in the debate on independence, but has previously publicly praised the union.

Earlier this month the Queen conferred the honour of Knight of the Order of Australia on the country's  Governor-General, Sir Peter Cosgrove. Sir Peter represents the Queen in Australia and is the head of the Australian defence force

First Minister Alex Salmond has vowed to keep the Queen as Scotland's head of state after independence

In a speech she gave to MPs on her Silver Jubilee in 1977 she said: ‘I number kings and queens of England and of Scotland, and princes of Wales among my ancestors and so I can readily understand these aspirations.

‘But I cannot forget that I was crowned Queen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.

‘Perhaps this jubilee is a time to remind ourselves of the benefits which union has conferred, at home and in our international dealings, on the inhabitants of all parts of this United Kingdom.’
