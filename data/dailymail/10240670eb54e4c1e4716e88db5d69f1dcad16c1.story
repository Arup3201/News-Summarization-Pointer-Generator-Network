The dead bodies of seven babies that were found hidden in a Utah garage have been sent to the state's medical examiner's office for DNA testing and to determine their cause of death.

Megan Huntsman, 39, is accused of killing her babies after giving birth to the children between 1996 and 2006, investigators said.

She was booked Sunday into the Utah County Jail with six counts of murder.

It wasn't immediately clear if Huntsman has an attorney or why there were six counts and not seven.

The bodies were found by her estranged husband Darren West, who has been in prison on drug-related charges prior to making the grisly discovery.

Roberts said police believe West and Huntsman were together when the babies were born.

DNA samples taken from the suspect and her husband will determine definitively whether the two are the parents, as investigators believe.

Huntsman also has three daughters — one teenager and two young adults — who lived at the house.

Late Sunday, West's family issued a statement saying they were in a 'state of shock and confusion.'

'We are mourning this tragic loss of life and we are trying to stay strong and help each other through this awful event,' the statement said before asking for privacy.

West pleaded guilty in federal court in 2005 to two counts of possessing chemicals intended to be used in manufacturing methamphetamine, court records show. In August 2006, he was sentenced to nine years in prison, but appealed the term three times. He maintained his innocence and said he never had any intention to manufacture meth. It is unclear when he was released.

What she did: Huntsman has been charged with six counts of murder, but it is unclear why she has not been charged with seven since that many bodies were found

West's sister Sarah Wright wrote to federal district court in 2006, saying West is a good father to his three daughters.

'Darren is such an awesome dad,' she wrote.

The gruesome case has raised a series of questions about how the killings occurred despite Huntsman carrying out what neighbors seemed like a normal existence.

Police declined to comment on a motive and what Huntsman said during an interview with investigators.

Police Capt. Michael Roberts said officers responded to a call from West on Saturday about a dead infant, and then they found the six other bodies.

Family and neighbors identified the estranged husband as Darren West, who has been in prison on drug-related charges.

Roberts said police believe West and Huntsman were together when the babies were born.

'We don't believe he had any knowledge of the situation,' Roberts told The Associated Press

Asked how the man could not have known about the situation, Roberts replied,

'That's the million-dollar question. Amazing.'

Huntsman moved out several years ago, leaving her three daughters, one teenager and two young adults, to live alone, their neighbors the Hawkers said. They weren't sure where Huntsman has since been living.

Years ago, Huntsman baby-sat the Hawker grandchildren and they were friendly with each other.

'It makes us so sad, we want to cry,' Kathie Hawker said. 'We enjoyed having them as a neighbor. This has just blown us away.'

Aaron Hawker said he talked with West on Saturday morning. He told Hawker he was cleaning out the mess in the garage.

'Two hours later, suddenly we had all these policemen here,' Aaron Hawker said.

Fred Newman, a neighbor whose cousin is the husband's mother, said he's perplexed how the three oldest daughters living there didn't know about what police say was going on.

He said the girls didn't always park their cars in the garage, but did sometimes in the cold winter months.

'What's shocking is the three older ones living there and not noticing that their mother was pregnant,' Newman said.

He said he has used his snow-blower to clean off the driveway of the home and the young women would thank him.

The girls were normal youngsters, coming and going often, neighbor Vickie Nelson said.

'It's shocking and kind of morbid and strange,' Nelson said as he looked across the street at the garage from her from lawn.
