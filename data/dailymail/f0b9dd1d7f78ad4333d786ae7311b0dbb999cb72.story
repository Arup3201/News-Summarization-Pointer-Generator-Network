Thousands of US soldiers spending Thanksgiving away from their families have celebrated with their comrades in bases around the world.

Around 24,000 troops stationed around Afghanistan sat down for their traditional turkey dinners. For many it will be their last with the end of NATO combat operations on December 31.

Huge shipments of meat, along with the essential cranberry sauce and pies, were also flown to Iraq, Kuwait, Jordan and Kosovo.

Food packages, were also sent to West African nations Liberia and Senegal - where around 2,000 service members are fighting the Ebola outbreak.

In his Thanksgiving address, President Obama paid tribute to the soldiers stationed across the globe for their continued bravery. He said: 'Today, we are grateful to all Americans who do their part to live by those ideals, including our brave men and women in uniform overseas and their families, who sacrifice so much to keep America safe. 

'To our service members who are away from home, we say an extra prayer for you and your loved ones, and we renew our commitment to take care of you as well as you've taken care of us.' 

Anthony Amendolia from the Defence Logistics Agency (DLA), who makes sure soldiers get their Thanksgiving food, told the US Army website: 'Since they can't be home for the holidays, our team is dedicated to bringing the holidays to them.

'Whether they're stationed on a remote base in Afghanistan, or a field hospital in West Africa, they'll be eating a traditional American Thanksgiving meal on November 27.'

The agency reported that  2,000 pounds of turkey, 300 pounds of cranberry sauce, and 500 pies will be sent to Liberia, while 600 pounds of turkey, 75 pounds of cranberry sauce, and 200 pies were sent to Senegal.

As many as 5,000 meals were served in each location - and troops even had the choice of apple, cherry, pumpkin, pecan or sweet potato pie.

As many of 24,000 troops are stationed in Afghanistan and are set to leave by the end of the year

While the subsistence team typically starts planning to ship holiday meal six months in advance, military operations in West Africa only began two months ago.

It meant that the turkeys had to be airlifted to the bases in time for them to be served.  

Two days ago it was revealed that some personnel returning to Joint Base Lewis-McChord from Africa will spend Thanksgiving in isolation while the Army monitors their health for signs of Ebola.

The group arriving Tuesday evening includes 15 service members and one Defense Department civilian who built facilities in Liberia to fight the fatal disease, the Army said.

They were not exposed to Ebola-infected patients and the risk that they picked up the fatal disease is very minimal, said I Corps Maj. Mary Ricks. Because they have no symptoms, the isolation is called controlled monitoring rather than quarantine, Ricks said Tuesday.

They'll have their temperature taken twice a day during their stay, which won't be a full 21 days because they've already spent some time in Germany.

Lewis-McChord is not their home base. They come from all over the country and one is stationed overseas, Ricks said.
