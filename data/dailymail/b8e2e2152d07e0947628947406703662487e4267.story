Taking inspiration from a recent real estate advertisement that used zombies to sell a Queensland home, a Tasmanian agency has found another creative way to market a 100-year-old house.

The ad that reads like a dating classified says the two-bedroom home in Invermay - a suburb in Launceston - named 'Mrs Russell' is 'looking for love' with a 'younger male'.

Located on Russell Street, the home is worth between $150,000 to $170,000 and was built on a 238-square-metre piece of land in the year of 1900.

Mrs Russell loves sunsets and tradesmen who drive utes, especially builders in Bonds singlets.

But she is realistic about her looks and age.

'Now don't laugh children, I've still got it,' the ad reassured potential buyers.

'I'm a little saggy in areas but I have extremely good bones and still standing strong.

'I'm a little saggy in areas but I have extremely good bones and still standing strong,' the ad says

'I have been an extremely attractive lady in my time and my beauty can be restored I just know it.

'I pray everyday that a young gentleman will come along and restore me to my former glory.'

The LJ Hooker Launceston ad also adds that her sisters in the same street have found love and they 'look happier than they have ever been'.

'So come on boys. Let's get together and show these young ones what timeless, true old fashioned beauty really is all about,' the tongue-in-cheek ad read.

Invermay is located in the inner city and is home to sporting stadium York Park - also known as Aurora Stadium. The suburb is known as Launceston's cultural district.
