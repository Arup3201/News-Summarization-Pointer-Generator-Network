The shocking moment a gunman shot dead three people in a Missouri office before killing himself has been caught on video.

The shooter, Ahmed Dirir, 59, an employee of AK Home Health Care, can be seen in the just-released surveillance tape throwing his arms up angrily as though arguing with someone. He then leaves and returns with a gun.

While the camera isn't in the room where the June 13 killings took place, eerie puffs of smoke can be seen through the walls from the hall as the gunshots ring out. The shots are about 30 seconds apart.

Dirir's victims were his relatives Saeed Abdulla, 29, and Khadra Muse, 44, who he worked with, and another employee Bernice Solomon-Redd, 54.

According to the police report, Dirir was angry because his relatives were about to start a new company without him and had already viewed another potential office.

The landlord told police Dirir knew about the plot because he'd been asking, 'Tell me when my relatives are going to leave,' KTVI News reported. Abdulla and Muse gave notice one week before the killings.

Redd's husband, who was in his doctor's waiting room where he had arranged to meet his wife the day of the shootings, has described the moment he learned of her death on TV.

'She always goes to the doctor with me. She was supposed to meet me at the V.A. at 2 p.m.,' Jesse Redd told KTVI.

'(Then
I heard) we have breaking news that they had this shooting down there 
on Cherokee. And I thought I'd better drive down there, because I kept 
calling my wife on her phone. I didn't ever get no answer.'

She
told him she had a meeting at midday and Mrs Redd can be seen on the 
tape walking into work at 2715 Cherokee Street, tragically for the last 
time.

'The good lord blessed me with her because with my health and everything, she made sure that I eat right, took my medicine, she did everything for me,' he said.

Mr Redd, who has played out the killings in his mind repeatedly, believes his wife never had a chance.

'When (Dirir) shut the door, he pulled his pistol out and bang, that's how close when he hit my wife in the head,' he explained.

'Bang â€” hit her, then his brother 
couldn't get out. He chased her then he killed them in there. Then he 
killed himself. That's the way I figured it how he did 'em. Cause I know
my wife. If she had a chance, because she had a black belt you know... 
that's how fast he did it. She didn't get a chance to get up.'

Two people upstairs heard shots and climbed out onto the roof to escape. A woman in a room next door and ran outside.

Then
another woman, not knowing what had just happened, walked right by the 
murder suicide and continued upstairs before realizing what had 
happened.

Less
than eight minutes later, St. Louis Police entered to discover the 
tragic scene. They used the video to quickly close the case.

Argument: Prior to the shooting, Dirir, pictured left earlier ion the day and right minutes before the shooting, appears to be arguing with someone in the office

Second shot: A second puff of smoke is faintly visible at the bottom right of the above shot near the trash bag

Dirir was a Somali immigrant, described by friends as an intelligent man who was quick to reach out to other new-arriving Somalis. They also said he had lingering anger years after the divorce from his first wife.

Dirir, Muse and Abdulla were all from Somalia, said Omar Jamal of the Somali mission to the U.N. Jamal at the time, after speaking with several friends and relatives of Dirir and the victims, including the men's wives.

The home health agency was headquartered in a small business incubator building in a former movie theater on Cherokee Street, a revitalizing mixed-race neighborhood about five miles south of downtown St. Louis.

Police Captain Michael Sack said Dirir used a semi-automatic handgun. A records search found no previous criminal record for Dirir except a couple of speeding cases. There was no record that he had a permit to carry a firearm.

Michael Graff, an attorney with an office in the incubator building, said he heard loud arguments from the home health agency from time to time, but that he hadn't known those disputes to become violent before.
