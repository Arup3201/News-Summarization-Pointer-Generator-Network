Corbett pleaded not guilty Wednesday, and bail was set at $2 million.

If convicted of the new charges, Corbett could face up to 12 years in prison.

There's no claim that Corbett brought weapons onto Bullock's property.

Police believe he was there simply to catch a glimpse of the actress.

Corbett allegedly entered Bullock's West Los Angeles home by climbing over a chain-link, barbed wire fence around 5am on Sunday.

Doting mother: The Speed actress is mother to four-year-old Louis. It was unclear where he was when the break-in occurred, but reports say Bullock locked herself in a room and called 911 after spotting the intruder herself

Police were not called until 6:30am, and have not disclosed whether her son Louis was present at the time, although he was believed to be with a nanny.

Sandra is said to have discovered Corbett herself, and promptly locked herself in a room until authorities arrived at the scene.

Corbett reportedly was in the actress' yard 'checking out the house' when police arrived.

Corbett has pleaded not guilty to the charges and the judge set his bond at $185,000.

Sources
 tell TMZ that it was not the intruder's intention to burglarize 
Sandra's home, but instead wanted 'face-to-face' time with the star.

It
 was also reported on Monday by Today that Corbett may have kept a diary
 on the super star and was most likely 'obsessed' with her.
