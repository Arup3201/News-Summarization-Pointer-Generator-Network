A police officer allegedly punched a rape victim in the face as she cowered naked in a closet at her boyfriend's home.

Rebecca Gibson, who has chosen to reveal her identity even though she is the victim of an alleged sex attack, says she was raped by two strangers who offered her a ride while she was walking near her apartment in San Antonio, Texas.

When she refused they attacked her, she claims.

Excessive force? A police officer punched an alleged rape victim in the face as she cowered naked in a closet at her boyfriend's home

Victim: Rebecca Gibson says she was raped by two strangers who offered her a ride while she was walking near her apartment

'Two men in a truck pulled up beside of me and asked if I needed a ride (and) I told them no,' Gibson told KSAT 12 News. 'I told them no again and one of them hit me in the back of the head and I woke up at four in the morning with no clothes, no money, no phone.'

The 29-year old mother said she woke up in a laundry a half-mile away from her apartment. After getting clothes from her apartment she went to her boyfriend's home, but quickly got into an argument.

'He just completely flipped out,' she said. He was apparently angry because she had been out all night without phoning him, and called police reporting that she had broken into his home.

When police arrived she was naked and hiding in a wardrobe, but refused to leave without a female officer present.

The male officers forcibly removed her, punching her in the face with such force it fractured her right orbital, she says.

The alleged sex attack victim was cuffed and taken to the emergency room where she had a rape examination. Medical staff also treated her facial injuries.

At the hospital the officer was boasting about hitting Gibson, a nurse wrote in a report seen by KSAT 12 News.

The report said, 'the officer was talking about it in a proud manner that he hit her.'

Gibson has now hired an attorney to pursue the complaint. Augustin Arredondo Junior said: 'The aggressiveness and hostility toward this victim, it doesn't seem appropriate when dealing with sexual assault victims.'

The San Antonio Police Department are investigating.

In a statement to the TV station, Public Information Officer Lt. Chris Benavides wrote: 'The preliminary investigation reveals an officer responded to the location for an individual refusing to leave.

'This individual appeared to be intoxicated and aggressive. After a brief struggle with police, she was subdued. During that struggle she was struck in the face. We take all allegations seriously and investigate them thoroughly.'

Miss Gibson denied she was drunk and said she was not combative with police.
