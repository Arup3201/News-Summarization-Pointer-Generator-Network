'She had been getting bullied for a long time, to the point where the happy, bubbly girl that I knew changed,' she told FOX 5.

According to Natika, the bullying wasn't just happening at school.'They hacked into her email and they created a Facebook page and they massacred her.'

Bird said she had tried to discuss the situation with Clark County School District police.

'The school police told me because it was not on school campus and after hours, I needed to call the regular police. The regular police told me, 'You need to call the school police,'' she said.

Eventually it got to the stage where Carla couldn't handle it anymore and she hung herself. 

Parents in similar situations need to contact every school administrator available advised Bird.

'You go as hard as you can, and at the same time let your kid know that this is not their fault,' she said.  

A GoFundMe account has been set up to help the family with funeral expenses.

Natika Bird said her daughter used to be happy and bubbly, but that she had changed as a result of bullying at school and online
