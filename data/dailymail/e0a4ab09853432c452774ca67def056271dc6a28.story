Scotland's goalscorer Ikechi Anya  celebrated his goal against world champions Germany on Monday by claiming he wouldn't have been able to do it FIFA.

Anya netted in the 66th minute in Dortmund to cancel out Thomas Muller's headed opener, and although the Bayern Munich striker scored again four minutes later to win the game for Germany, the goal was a moment of considerable pride for Scotland.

The Watford midfielder thanked the travelling fans on the social media site and expressed his disbelief at scoring against Manuel Neuer, widely considered to be the best goalkeeper in the world.

Delight: Anya took to twitter to express his excitement at scoring such a big goal for his country

Disbelief: A clearly emotional Anya celebarates the goal, which he claims he can't replicate on the video game

'I scored past Manuel Neuer!!! Wowwww I can't even do that on FIFA,' posted Anya in a series of tweets.

'In all actuality to work this hard for a passion is worth more than a salary... BEST FEELIN EVER !!!! no words needed,' he continued.

Anya,  26, also posted a longer message to thank the fans for their support, which he attached to a tweet.

'The fact that I had a hand in making so many people happy last night it's such a reward in itself and something that leaves me feeling very proud...So I guess I'm thanking y'all for letting me know how much it meant to you' 

Pride: Scotland were only level for four minutes but it was an excellent display against the world champions

Priceless: The Scottish goalscorer said the feeling was worth more than money as he netted in Dortmund
