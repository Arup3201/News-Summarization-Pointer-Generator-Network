The Hartford, Conn. Police department was the scene of a mind-blowing vandalism. A Hartford police officer's car was mysteriously damaged on Wednesday.

Strangely enough, no one is to blame.

Surveillance footage of a 'ghostlike' entity twirling around the parking lot and brushing up against the cop car is the unlikely culprit.

The footage shows the 'ghostly' fog creeping towards the car, violently twirling around the vehicle, and then ripping the vehicle's mirror and jostling it mid air. Finally the mirror drops harshly to the ground beneath the car door.Â

'At the end of his shift, he went out to
his car and found his rear view mirror had been damaged and it was 
lying there next to his vehicle,' said Lt. Brian Foley of the Hartford 
Police department.

At first, cops thought that a human was responsible for the damage but the surveillance video footage proved otherwise.

'Some of the officers said they think the parking lot's haunted,' said Lt. Brian Foley to NBC Connecticut.

NBC Connecticut meteorologist Brad Feild concluded that the mysterious fog was actually a dust devil

Brad Field, an NBC Connecticut meteorologist, believes there is a more scientific explanation for the event.

After reviewing the video, Field concluded that the fog was not a ghost, but a dust devil. A dust devil is a mini-tornado of sorts. It's a swirl of wind that picks up the debris surrounding it. They have been known to form on asphalt surfaces.

'The only way you can see the dust devil is that it picks up dust and debris into it,' Field said.

'To be able to rip a mirror off a car, throw it around and then put it right back below where it was ripped off is interesting ... to say the least,' Foley told NBC.

A public information officer for the Hartford Police department told the Mail Online that while the event was creepy he hadn't heard of any other parking lot hauntings.

'I haven't heard to much of that stuff going on there but don't scare me because I parked my car there. Maybe you can research what building was previously on this land to investigate evidence of a haunting,' he joked.

The car mirror was ripped off the car and swept through the air before it fell down to the asphalt beneath the car door
