A disabled tax clerk is suing her boss who she claimed treated her 'in the manner in which Adolf Hitler treated the disabled and the Jews during the Holocaust.'

Michelle Ruppert, 45, has filed a discrimination lawsuit against New Jersey's Borough of Point Pleasant's Office of the Tax Collector alleging she was verbally abused and harassed during her three year stint with the business.

Ruppert claimed that on her first day of work in 2011, her boss, 69-year-old Bernadine Pearce, showed her a 'Wall of Shame' with a fake funerary urn filled with the 'ashes of problem employees' who'd been 'exterminated'.

Asbury Park Press reported the wall was posted on a cabinet in the main tax collector’s office for at least two years of Ruppert’s employment.

Pearce allegedly 'opined that all 
personnel of her office should be 'perfect humans', as she believed she 
was', according to the five-count civil lawsuit filed last week.

The suit claims Pearce threw papers at Ruppert, called her a 'waste of a human being', encouraged Pearce’s daughter and co-worker to give her the middle finger and called her a 'mess up' who should just 'quit her job'.

'No reasonable person would find
 despicable conduct such as that acceptable,' Ruppert’s attorney, 
Rosemarie Arnold, told ABC News. 'That should not be allowed
 in a workplace.'

Ruppert also accused Pearce, who has worked at the borough for 39 years, of making 'outrageous comments' that are 'too numerous to list', including, 'To people like you, 2+4 must equal 8'.

Ruppert claimed her boss intended to 
'shame and harass' her, calling her a 'waste as a human being', and 
slamming her fists in front of her.

Pearce 'engaged in a severe and 
pervasive pattern of mentally abusive and offensive behavior directed at
 plaintiff, who suffered from a disability, which conduct was designed 
to, among other things, punish plaintiff for being disabled and cause 
plaintiff severe emotional distress,' the lawsuit stated.

Ruppert, from Lacey, alleged
 she took sick leave for psychiatric treatment as a result of workplace 
bullying and and upon returning, found her workspace had been relocated 
so that she would face the Wall of Shame, which had her name below it.

APP reported Ruppert is also suing Borough Administrator David Maffei, claiming he should have investigated Ruppert’s complaints against Pearce to take steps to prevent a hostile working environment and discrimination.

The suit claimed Maffei 'intentionally, willfully, wantonly, recklessly and/or negligently' failed to take action because Pearce was 'his close personal friend'.

Maffei and Pearce declined to comment to ABC News, citing the pending litigation.

Ruppert is suing the borough, Maffei and Pearce for unspecified damages claiming emotional distress, humiliation and psychological harm.

Although Ruppert is still reportedly employed at the tax office, the Borough of Mount Pleasant has advertised on its Facebook page for a part-time temporary tax clerk. It is not clear if this is Ruppert's position.
