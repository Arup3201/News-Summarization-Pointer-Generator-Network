It was the biggest hair trend of last summer, and it seems pink hair is back on fashion's radar - but not as you might remember it.

The rosy hue was huge on catwalks and editorials again for SS14 but instead of washed out or dip dye, colour was seen only through the mid-lengths - leaving roots and tips untouched.

New York-based colorist Aura Friedman pioneered the 'halo' trend in August on Chairlift singer Caroline Polachek by bleaching a stripe across her brunette hair. Now, supermodel Poppy Delevingne, who is marrying her man James Cook today, is the latest star to sport a splashlight - but this time it's a girly shade of pink, and totally noncommittal. She's not likely to be wearing it for her big nuptials.

L'Oréal Professionnel SS14 IT LOOKS campaign includes international IT girl Poppy Delevingne in a key colour trends for this season - the splash of pink

She is engaged to be married and loved-up Poppy, 28, is now willing to try new things with her hair look for the first time ever.

Poppy 
says: 'For me, it’s the perfect evolution of the dip dye, which 
was the big colour story of recent years.

'This is the first time I've changed the 
colour of my hair. I've been blonde all my life and felt this was the 
moment to try something different.

'Since I was a little girl I always wanted to one day have pink hair, especially after the cartoon character Jem and the holograms where the lead character had long, candy floss coloured hair.'

The Splashlight, credited as one of L'Oréal Professionnel's latest IT Looks for SS14, involves adding a horizontal 
band of striking colour - a splash of pink for example - through the mid length section.

Poppy's look was created especially for the brand using their new Hairchalks.

It's inspired by the huge influx of pink on the catwalk in both clothes and make-up at Lanvin, Victoria Beckham, Giorgio Armani, Balmain and Prabel Gurung.

The daring new colour trend is now slowly filtering through to 
celebrities and fashionistas, soon to be seen on High Streets 
everywhere as girls flock to hairdressers requesting this style.

Tell us about the splashlight you created for Poppy:

It’s
 a new and original way of adding a flash of colour to long hair, a 
horizontal band of striking colour that runs through the mid-lengths 
section. This placement is what makes the look so eye catching, because
 it is unexpected and you intrigued as to how the splashlight was 
created.

Why was Poppy chosen to model the pink splashlight IT Look:

Because, like Poppy, the splashlight is fun and fresh. The pastel pink also works particularly well on natural blonde base.

Can I try a splashlight if I'm brunette?

I
 might choose a colour that was a little deeper and darker. Perhaps a 
violet or purple shade to compliment the natural brown base.

Is skin tone important to consider when choosing a splashlight colour?

The
 most important thing is to start with a base of natural hair colour at 
the roots and ends because it will tie in with the skin tone. You can 
then be more experimental with your choice of splashlight shade. L’Oreal
 Professionel Hairchalk is great since it provides a range of bold 
colour options but the commitment is low since it washes out after a few
 shampoos.

A L'Oreal spokesperson said: 'With
 pink so visible on the catwalk, the trend seemed to escalate as the 
year went on and Splashlight was a new placement area in the hair 
(middle band on Poppy).

'It gives a big impact without as much commitment 
as an all over colour wash to the vibrant shade alongside the launch of 
our Hairchalks.

'The trend means you could go pink for the weekend and be back to 
normal on Monday for work.'

Poppy recently returned from the Coachella festival, where she celebrated her upcoming nuptials with a series of mini hen dos.
