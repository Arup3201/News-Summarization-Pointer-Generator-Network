She was born into a poor family, in a terrible town at the start of the Great Depression, but Irene Triplet can still manage to crack a smile.

The 84-year-old, who has lived in an institution since she was 13, is the last child of an American Civil War soldier who is still receiving benefits linked to the conflict and the keeper of an incredible personal story.

As the MailOnline revealed last year, each month she is paid $72.13 in VA benefits - totaling $876 a year, thanks to her father, Pvt. 

  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  

          Moses Triplett, taking part in the war that ended in 1865 - but more about Irene's tale has been uncovered by the Wall Street Journal.

Irene's father, PVT. Triplett, was branded a traitor for fleeing the Confederates and going to fight for the Unionists.

Irene Triplett, 84, is the last child of an American Civil War soldier still receiving benefits linked to the conflict, this is her in 2010 along with
historian Jerry Orton

Moses was 83-years-old when he fathered 
Irene, following the death of his first wife in the 1920s and a fast 
wedding to his second.

His new bride, Elida Hall, was nearly 60 years his junior and suffered from a mental disability.

Such an age gap was not uncommon at the 
time - the women got a good pension and a reliable source of income and 
the men got a younger wife who would care for them in their old age.

Irene was born prematurely in Wilkes County, North Carolina, on January 9, 1930.

She also suffered from some mental disabilities.

Pvt. Triplett was just shy of his 87th birthday when Elida gave birth to a son, Everette.

Irene and Everette Triplett were born into poverty - a tiny log cabin in the mountains surrounded by illegal distilleries.

Ms. Triplett said she didn't drink moonshine, but she got hooked on tobacco in first grade.

'I dipped snuff in school, and I chewed tobacco in school,' Ms. Triplett told The Journal.

'I raised homemade tobacco. I chewed that, too. I chewed it all.'

Irene said her teachers beat her with an oak paddle. 

Her parents continued the beatings at home.

'When you got a whooping in school you'd be getting tore up when you got back in those mountains,' she said.

At school, children would taunt Irene about her father the 'traitor'.

He died when she was eight, before dropping out of school after sixth grade, unable to read or write proficiently. 

Of her parents, she said: 'I didn't care for neither one of them, to tell you the truth about it. 

'I wanted to get away from both of them. I wanted to get me a house and crawl in it all by myself.'

Suffering disabilities and unable to look after herself, Irene has spent the past 70 years living in a facility

In 1943, 13-year-old Irene and her mother, unable to fend for themselves, moved into the Wilkes County poorhouse, a desolate two-story brick building on the outskirts of town, littered with mice and rats.

The facility included a 'colored ward' and jail for black prisoners, while residents with tuberculosis were housed separately in the TB hut.

Though just 10 years old, Everette ran away rather than live in the poorhouse.

Everette made his way to Roxboro, N.C., and found work in a saw mill. 

He became a bulldozer operator and died in 1996.

Irene and Elida Triplett remained at the county home for 17 years. The facility shut down in 1960, and Irene and her mother moved into a new private nursing home. 

The women didn't get along and had to have separate rooms.

According to Everett’s oldest son Charlie Triplett, 59, Moses - or ‘Uncle Mose’ as he was known - was quite the character.

Moses had been married before Elida 
and a picture of him with his first wife shows him with a rattlesnake 
around his neck and a long mustache coming below his chin, in the style
 of Wyatt Earp.

Charlie said: ‘He used to sit on his 
porch shooting acorns out of trees. He owned lots of land and his 
neighbors were scared of him.

‘There was one time when he lost all 
his savings when the bank he kept it with shut down. He went down there 
and stood on a car shouting at everyone like some kind of preacher.

‘After that he kept all his money in a big bag.

‘There was another time when he saw a black man on his property so he thought he was a slave.

'I didn't play around,' Irene said of her time in the homes. 

'I mowed the grass. I washed dishes, made up beds, washed and ironed. They had hogs. They raised hogs up there. I raised eight hogs.'

Once a month, the two women would cash their VA pension checks, which helped pay for their care. 

Under the terms of her father's benefits package, because Irene was disabled under the age of 18 - she had deformities at birth - she would get financial assistance for the rest of her life.

At one point, Irene's brother, Everette, invited her to live with him, but she had grown accustomed to institutional life and declined.

Elida Triplett died of cancer in 1967.

Irene Triplett lived in the nursing home for more than half a century until she broke her hip last year and moved into the Wilkesboro skilled-nursing facility.

Medicaid pays her expenses at the home, supplemented by the VA pension her father earned her in 1865.

She said she likes the facility more than anywhere else she has lived. She gets very few visitors, but enjoys working on crafts and watching TV.

She is bound to a wheelchair but still chews tobacco religiously.

The local genealogical society article painted a picture of Irene’s life that was unrelentingly harsh.

It said she does ‘not recall much of her childhood and does not have any recollection of Moses’.

She has ‘virtually no memories of fun, presents, neighbors or such as they lived so isolated and she had to work on the farm each day’ where they raised chickens and pigs.

Irene was tracked down by the dedicated research of Lorraine Orton, the former national historian for the Women’s Relief Corps until her death in November last year.

Her husband Jerry, from Syracuse, New York, was also involved in the research and has been handling matters since then.

Mr Orton told MailOnline: ‘I know Irene and I have visited her. She’s not as old as you think.

‘Irene is illiterate and never really learned to read or write. She grew up in the Appalachians and was very poor.

‘She has autism and when she was born they did not really have the resources to help people.

‘She can take care of herself but her cognitive abilities were impaired when she was born.

‘She took 30 years to track down - I wrote to her and other children whose parents had fought in the Civil War and she was the only one that wrote back. I’ve visited her twice and we’ve written a few times.

‘It was her birthday in January and I
 know that people do send her money. She can’t have any more than than 
$2,000 in her checking account or she won’t be entitled to her 
benefits.’

MailOnline spoke to Jerry Orton at his Syracuse home. He has meet with Irene several times in recent years

Asked if 
Miss Triplett had ever spoken about the fact she is still benefiting 
from the Civil War, he said: ‘She doesn’t really have any memories of 
her father. Because of her condition, visits with her last 10 minutes 
then you know the visit is over.

‘The man who runs the facility is very sympathetic to her because he is a veteran himself.

‘One time I asked her what she wanted more than anything else and she jokingly said: ‘Money!’

‘Irene
 is the only person who is receiving benefits from the federal 
government. It’s possible that there are some who are getting benefits 
from individual states, but she is the only one getting federal money.

‘Her father actually fought for the Confederate and the Union side. I’ve seen other cases like this but the federal government is still paying her benefits.

‘When we spoke to the United Daughters of the Confederacy (which represents daughters of Confederate soldiers) about her, they called her a traitor - and they meant it’.

Some 4,038 widows, sons and daughters get monthly VA pension or other payments. 

The government's annual tab for surviving family from those long-ago wars comes to $16.5 million.

Spouses, parents and children of deceased veterans from World War II, Korea, Vietnam, Kuwait, Iraq and Afghanistan received $6.7 billion in the 2013 fiscal year that ended Sept. 30. 

Payments are based on financial need, any disabilities, and whether the veteran's death was tied to military service.
