As if the retirement of Sir Alex Ferguson wasn’t disorientating enough, now comes a proper bombshell, the news that after nearly 40 years another Scotsman, James Alexander Gordon, is retiring from reading the classified football results on the radio.

'It's with great sorrow that I have to 
give up the most exciting part of my career, the classified football 
results,' said the Scot. 'They have been my life.'

Sports Report without JAG? That’s almost too much to take. After all, we football enthusiasts over the age of 45 practically grew up listening to Gordon mellifluously intoning Stockport County 1 Crewe Alexandra 1.

Hanging up his mic: James Alexander Gordon is one of the most recognisable voices on radio

Thanks to him and the late Len 
Martin, who did the same job on Grandstand for aeons, Saturday teatimes 
acquired a reassuring certainty that was only threatened by the 
occasional freak result you couldn’t predict after they’d read the home 
team’s score.

Usually, gloriously, the inflection would tell you exactly what was coming.

But just occasionally the football 
gods threw a quirky one into the mix, like Southport 3 York City 7. 
Gordon, of course, always took it entirely in his stride.

Southport dropped out of the League 
in 1978, but they were my home-town team and for all the years that they
 languished in the old Fourth Division, Gordon’s fleeting weekly mention
 gave me untold pleasure whether they won, lost or drew.

It seemed like a validation not just of where I lived, but who I was.

Moreover, there was and still is a romance about the less conventionally named teams with which he will forever be associated.

Queen of the South, Hamilton 
Academical, Plymouth Argyle, Partick Thistle, those were names to 
conjure with, and the Two Ronnies famously did. To relish their football
 results sketch — Dumbarton 1 Dick Barton 0, Motherwell 2 Dad 
Sick-as-a-Parrot 1, and the immortal half-time scoreline, East Fife 5 
Forfar so far 4 — was to feel the warm embrace of collective 
Britishness. No outsider would have known what the hell they were on 
about.

Great voice: Gordon's inflection meant you knew exactly how your team had done

I know some people whose fascination 
with football was ignited by JAG reading the results, and even one who, 
as a six-year-old, chose his team — Doncaster, although he grew up in 
Devon — purely because he liked the sombre, authoritative way it rolled 
off Gordon’s tongue.

It is immeasurably sad that, at the 
age of 77, JAG is being forced into retirement by throat cancer, which 
has required the removal of his larynx. But his status as a British 
institution is assured, so much so that I once heard his name ventured 
as the answer to the quiz question: Who invented the telephone?

Saturdays will never be the same again.
