A Georgia man was left bloodied and bruised after he was brutally attacked for dating an African-American girl.

The interracial couple were strolling through Ellis Square, a public space in Savannah, shortly before midnight last Friday, when they say three black men began taunting them.Â 

The provocation began as racial slurs, then the scoffers started blowing kisses and suddenly the trio jumped the boyfriend, Andrew Quade - who is white, beating him and leaving him barely conscious.

Insults: Andrew Quade and his girlfriend Olufisayo Bakre were strolling through the historic Ellis Square in downtown Savannah when a gang of three black men attacked him

The violent response to the mixed-race
 romance has left the couple in shock that such 
vicious intolerance still exists.

'This shouldn't happen in this day in 
age. I know we're in the South and all that, but it's time for a 
change,' the girlfriend, Olufisayo Bakre, told WTOC-TV news.

The couple say they were simply minding their own business as they walked through the Savannah spot, one of the busiest squares in the historic downtown, known for being the epitome of Southern charm.

Then the group targeted the couple.

'One of them was making racial comments at us and one of the them was blowing kisses. It was a very aggravating situation to be in,' Bakre explained.

Quade, 23, said he tried to stay calm and just keep moving when the insults began.

'I didn't want to like freak out on 
them,' he told the local news station.

'I was trying to 
gain a little more knowledge about the situation and before we could 
even do that, it was just bam bam.'

He said everything happened so quickly when the gang attacked him, that he doesn't even have a clear picture in his mind of the fight.

The next thing he remembered was waking up in an ambulance.

'He was basically left for dead,' Bakre said of the terrifying ordeal.

'I was trying to pry them off and before I knew it he was on the floor. It happened all so quickly,' she added.

Bakre insisted that the couple did 
nothing to provoke the brawl and is confident that the pair's racial 
difference is what motivated the confrontation.

'Definitely, it's that simple,' she 
said, with Quade adding that there just wasn't 'any logical reason they 
would have to just go all out like that.'

Bakre said that being an interracial 
couple in the U.S. South has come with its challenges but nothing that 
has ever escalated to this kind of violence.

'The worst we'll get will be a stare or like a snicker here or there but not physical contact,' she said.

Let justice roll down: Olufisayo Bakre said she hopes justice will prevail in the situation

Police are now investigating and searching for the perpetrators.

They are reviewing surveillance video
 of the clash but say the footage is grainy and the cameras were located
 far away from the incident, so it is difficult to make out the faces of
 the assailants.

'I just hope they get caught. I just hope justice prevails at the end of the day,' Bakre said.
