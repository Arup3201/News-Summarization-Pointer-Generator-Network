Jack Rodwell believes he can step straight in to England’s midfield in the wake of Steven Gerrard’s retirement – but is confident he could also do a job at centre-back for his country.

Rodwell watched England’s horror show in Brazil with a sense of frustration having found himself out of the Three Lions picture following two seasons on the fringes at Manchester City.

He signed for Sunderland this week in a £10million deal – where he has been guaranteed a start in the middle of the park – and the 23-year-old wants a place in Roy Hodgson’s squad for this month’s friendly with Norway.

‘For me, it was difficult to watch (the World Cup) because I wanted to be there so much,’ said the three-times capped former Everton man.

‘Now I want to be back in it - that’s why I signed here.’

And Rodwell is confident of winning that call, regardless of the position.

‘I’d back myself to get back in at centre-midfield and I believe I could at centre-back,’ he added.

It is in midfield, however, where he would prefer to influence matches.

‘I’m here (at Sunderland) as a central midfielder,’ he said.

‘I haven’t played centre-back since I was 16 really. But you never know, maybe one day I might step back when I’ve got no legs.

‘I’m wasted if I play there though. I think I’ve got more to offer than playing centre-back – it’s boring as well.’

In the wake of England’s worst-ever showing at a World Cup finals, it was suggested that players could benefit from escaping the Premier League and broadening their horizons overseas.

That, however, is not for Rodwell, despite several offers.

‘I need to be seen here playing regularly if I want to get back into the England team, but maybe in the future (I’d go abroad),’ he said.

‘Never say never, but at the moment the Premier League is where it’s happening. That’s where you will be written about.’

Rodwell has followed the path of new team-mate Adam Johnson in fleeing City in search of regular football.

And he hopes Hodgson will pay more visits to the Stadium of Light than the sole one he managed last season.

‘I’d like Roy Hodgson to see as many games as he could, obviously, and I think Adam Johnson was a little bit unlucky not to have got into the squad for the World Cup,’ he went on.

‘He had a very good end to the season, so hopefully the manager will get up here as much as possible.’
