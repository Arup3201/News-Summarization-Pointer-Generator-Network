Facebook’s long-rumored autoplay ads are now a reality.

The social network announced Tuesday that it will begin rolling out its own version of the boorish video ads this week to a small number of users who might not mind them as much as they think.

The launch comes only one day after a report suggesting such ads were imminent as Facebook looks to make inroads into the upwards of $66billion spent on television advertising this year.

They're coming!: The autoplay ads as they appear on a mobile device

Facebook has taken a number of steps to try to mitigate the certain backlash from users, but not everyone seems to agree the site has done enough to make them less-intrusive than if they did not play automatically.

They will play the second they appear on a user’s screen, but will have no sound unless tapped or clicked on – solving one of the major complaints more internet surfers have about auto-play ads.

The ads also will not autoplay on mobile devices unless they are connected to WiFi, which will limit the hit people take to their data plans. 

The catch to the ads not playing unless mobile devices are connected to WiFi is that the Facebook app will download them – which will eat further into precious storage space already consumed by music, photos and apps.

Once the video ad is finished playing, a carousel giving people the option of viewing more video ads will appear.

The first advertiser taking advantage of the new platform is Lions Gate Entertainment – with an ad for the film ‘Divergent’ that was made specifically for Facebook.

These features don’t appear to be set in stone, as Facebook said the ads are open for further tweaking during this ‘intial, limited test.’

‘We’ll continue to refine this new way for brands to tell stories on Facebook to ensure the best experience for people and marketers.’

Despite the rollout not yet being site-wide, the backlash has already begun.

‘This feature does NOT improve my experience on Facebook, and actually it makes my experience worse than before,’ wrote one user.

‘Please provide a way to TURN OFF auto-play for those of us who do not want it!’ Another person pleaded.

The announcement came only one day after the Wall Street Journal reported the ads’ launch would happen later this week.

The Journal originally reported over the summer the ads were imminent, Facebook delayed the launch ‘fearing ads could annoy users.’

Facebook’s foray into autoplay video ads comes only one month after Instagram – which is owned by Facebook – launched video ads of its own.
