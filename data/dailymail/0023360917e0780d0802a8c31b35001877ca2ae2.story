They are usually spotted off the pitch, cheering on their other halves in designer clothes, flawless make-up and carrying enviable handbags.

But these WAGs have manned up and taken part in a gruelling assault course set over 200 acres of farmland in Perton, South Staffordshire.

The 'Tough Guy' challenge, designed to replicate trench warfare, features more than 160 obstacles - including running through nettles, battling fire pits and clambering up 20-metre high cargo nets.

Tough: Dani Emery - girlfriend of Manchester United footballer Ben Amos - battles through mud under barbed wire during the assault course in Perton, South Staffordshire

Warming up: Kaya Hall - girlfriend of Manchester United's Phil Jones - and Chantelle Tagoe - fiance of ex-England striker Emile Heskey - also took part in the challenge

Challenging: Glamour model Sam Cooke - girlfriend of Manchester United's Chris Smalling - receives a kiss from a fellow participant as she tackles the 200-acre course

Competitiors are required to haul themselves over huge wooden barricades, plunge into a freezing lake and crawl under an electrified fence dubbed 'The Tiger'.

Twelve WAGs took part in the course - billed the world's 'safest, most dangerous three to four hours of mental and physical endurance' - to raise money for Limitless Skies.

The charity, founded by Sam Cooke - girlfriend of Manchester United defender Chris Smalling - supports orphans and vulnerable children in Tanzania, Africa.

Striking a pose: Jayel Williams swings from a rope during the high-endurance course, which also includes 'killing fields' and a hillside slalom

Achievement: Twelve WAGs took part in the challenge - billed the world's 'safest, most dangerous three to four hours of mental and physical endurance - including Amy Orange, Miss Williams, Miss Emery, Miss Cooke, Miss Tagoe, Louise Quartey-Papafio, Lisa Horner and Miss Hall

As well as Miss Cooke, England star Phil Jones's girlfriend Kaya Hall and young keeper Ben Amos's girlfriend Dani Emery took part in the challenge. 

They were also joined by Chantelle Tagoe, the fiance of ex-England striker Emile Heskey. 

Speaking after the ordeal, Miss Cooke said: 'As a group we wanted to really test ourselves and raise money for Limitless Skies in the process.

Raising money: The WAGs were raising funds for Limitless Skies - a charity which supports orphans and vulnerable children in Tanzania, Africa

Getting muddy: Miss Williams and Miss Emery get muddy in a river during the challenge, which was set over 200 acres of farmland

'We had heard that Tough Guy is the hardest obstacle challenge out there both physically and mentally.

'Training and getting fit for the event was great fun - we just wanted to raise as much money as possible for the children and that was what got us around the course.'

She added: 'I will definitely be recommending Tough Guy to Chris and his team-mates.'

Every year, around 5,000 people take part in a race around the assault course - however, a third never even make the finishing line.

This year's event on January 24 was made even tougher by a rapid melt of snow which took place overnight - something that, luckily, the WAGs didn't have to deal with.
