An entire log cabin was reported missing in rural Oregon after the homeowner turned up after a year to find his backwoods lot was empty.

Ronald Niederbrach called the Klamath County Sherrif's office on Tuesday to report that his 1,500 sq ft cabin - and its deck - had vanished into thin air. 

Police launched an investigation and by Thursday had discovered the wooden property half a mile away - and with a new owner who was allegedly sold the home by the former husband of Niederbrach's ex-girlfriend.

What, at first, had been the mystery of the missing cabin was suddenly the mystery of who really owned the home - and a more complicated civil dispute. 

After talking to local residents, officers found the cabin 'in plain view', according to OregonLive.  

Niederbrach originally purchased land  and lived alongside  in a separate house  with his girlfriend, Paulette Kallo.

After Paulette's ex-husband, Miklos Kallo, developed health problems, he moved onto the property so she could take care of him.

It was Mr Kallo who built the log cabin and lived there.

The Klamath Sheriff's office told Daily Mail Online all three individuals are still titled to the land.  

After Niederbrach and Paulette split up, he moved away. Miklos Kallo and his former wife then got back together and lived in the home she had formerly shared with Niederbrach.

When that home caught on fire and became uninhabitable, the couple decided to move off the land. 

Last summer, Mr Kallo sold the cabin to a fourth person, who hired a logging company and transported the structure to where it stands now.

It is not exactly known when Niederbrach heard his cabin  was missing, but when he called his ex-girlfriend, she claimed not to know anything.

The sheriff's office were now trying to figure out who can lay claim to the cabin.

They were also determining whether the case is even  criminal at all - or just a civil dispute.

Detective Eric Shepherd described the whole incident as 'a mess' but said he believes the man who bought the cabin will be keeping it.  

'The person who has the cabin now is completely legal,' Shepherd told Daily Mail Online. 'He did absolutely nothing wrong and did everything he was supposed to do.' 

Shepherd said although the purchase of the cabin was legal, the sale of the property might not have been.

This is because, although Mr Kallo bought the log cabin kit that was used to build the house's exterior frame, Niederbrach claims he put a substantial amount of his own money into the house's development. 

'There was a great deal of other money invested to make that a livable home,' Shepherd said. 

Shepherd said there may be some financial liability, but he doesn't believe it will change who ultimately gets the house. 

'As far as who ends up with the cabin it won’t matter,' he said. 'It should be maintained by the person who purchased it.'  

But for now, the cabin remains in the Sheriff department's care. 

'We have in our custody a home,' said Sheriff Frank Skrah at a press conference. 'I don’t know where we’re going to put it or where we’re going to book it, but we have a home.'
