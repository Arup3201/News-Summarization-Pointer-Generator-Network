A megachurch has settled a civil 
lawsuit brought by a mother whose then-13-year-old daughter was raped 
last year in a ministry stairwell by an ex-janitor, it emerged today.

The Tulsa church spokesman Justin Johnson says 
details of the settlement between Victory Christian Center and the 
mother are confidential and declined to comment further on behalf 
of the 17,000-member organization.

The ex-janitor Chris Denman, now 21, pleaded guilty toÂ  all charges related to the rape and was sentenced to 55 years in prison last year.

Sordid: The rape took place at the Victory Christian Center megachurch in Oklahoma by an ex-janitor who later pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 55 years in prison

Chris Denman, 20, was sentenced to 55 years in prison for raping a 13-year-old girl at the megachurch. Three other victims under the age of 18 later came forward with allegations against him

He was charged with first-degree rape, 
forcible oral sodomy, lewd molestation, making a lewd proposal to a 
child and two counts of using a computer to facilitate a sex crime.

Five Victory employees - including John and Charica Daugherty, the 
son and daughter-in-law of ministry co-founder and head pastor Sharon 
Daugherty - were charged because they waited two weeks before reporting 
the girl's rape to authorities.

John and Charica Daugherty were charged with failure to report a crime and were given five-year deferred sentences with no jail time.

Implicated: John and Charica Daugherty (third and fourth from the right) were ordered to visit at least 20 organizations that work with children to talk with employees about properly reporting abuse

The judge expressed his feelings that the matter had not been handled properly by the church, which oversees 17,000 members in Tulsa.

'I want the hammer over your heads, Mr and Mrs Daugherty, for a longer period of time. I want to make sure things are done right.'

John is the son of senior pastor Sharon Daughterty, who runs the popular radio broadcast 'Victory in Jesus', which can be heard in over 200 countries.

Three other co-workers for Victory were sentenced along with the Daughertys.

Paul Willemstein and Anna George were sentenced to thirty days in jail, while Harold Sullivan faces a one-year suspended sentence.

Controversial: Victory Christian Center has seen several allegations alleging sexual misconduct emerge from their over 17,000 person congregation over the last year

Head: Sharon Daugherty is an influential member of the Oklahoma Christian community who has authored several books and runs a radio program that broadcasts in over 200 countries

The megachurch has been under intense scrutiny following the rape, with even more cases of under-reporting emerging.

KJRH has learned that as of September there were four girls under the age of 18 who had reported sexual allegations against Denman.

In October, another ex-janitor, Israel Shalom Castillo, 24, was sentenced to 18 months in prison for making a lewd proposal to a child.

Castillo's crime involved a separate victim but was reported to authorities at about the same time as Denman's crime.
