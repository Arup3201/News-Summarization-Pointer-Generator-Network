A tiny village in central France is appealing for funds to help preserve the bedroom of a  First World War  soldier that has remained completely unchanged since his death in 1918.

Dragoons' Second lieutenant Hubert Rochereau died in the back of a British field ambulance after being wounded during fighting for the village of Loker in Belgium almost 100 years ago.

His body was originally buried in a British cemetery, and his parents, who initially had no idea where their son's body was, decided to preserve his old bedroom as a permanent shrine.

Time capsule: The bedroom of First World War soldier Hubert Rochereau which has remained untouched for almost 100 years. The local mayor is appealing for funds to help preserve the unique historical site

Second Lieutenant Rochereau's body was eventually repatriated to his home village of Belabre in 1922, but his parents decided to continue to keep his room exactly as it had been when he left to fight in the war.

When they sold the large family house in 1936, they bricked up the entrance to the room and stipulated that it should not be changed for another 500 years.

The house was sold to French General Eugene Bridoux who went on to become secretary of state during the Vichy regime helping to deport thousands of French Jews to Nazi concentration camps.

Bridoux escaped the death sentence for war crimes by fleeing to Franco's Spain where he died in 1955. Meanwhile the house was rented to a family of solicitors before being reclaimed in the 1950s by his granddaughter whose husband Daniel Fabre still lives there. 

Relics: The fallen soldier's medals  sit on the wrought iron bed alongside pictures of his friends who also died in the war, left, while a moth-eaten uniform still hangs from the wall

Mr Fabre has preserved the bedroom in its original state and said he hopes any new owner will do the same.  

The bedroom has since remained untouched but  there are fears that a future owner could clear it out as the 500 year clause in the original 1936 sale document has no basis under French law.

Mr Fabre told the Nouvelle Republique newspaper: 'This clause had no legal basis, but we believe the room should be left unchanged.

'If we sell, we will be looking for a new owner that respects Hubert Rochereau's memory and keeps this extraordinary museum piece intact.'

Now the Mayor of Belabre Laurent Laroche is appealing for benefactors to help preserve the unique historical site by transforming it into a museum.

He told the Guardian: 'They knew about the room at the end of the corridor but had never seen it because it was bricked up. So they broke down the wall and made this strange discovery.

'It would be a great shame for it to disappear. As someone who loves history, I feel it's also important not to forget the sacrifice made by men like Rochereau.'

Rochereau, who was born  in Belabre in 1896, received a posthumous croix de guerre and the Legion of Honour for his courage in battle - the medals now sit on his old bed surrounded by photographs of his friends who also died in the war.

On his desk a pipe sits still filled with tobacco alongside a packet of cigarettes and  a vial labelled 'the soil of Flanders on which our dear child fell and which has kept his remains for four years.'

A moth-eaten army uniform is still on its hanger. Schoolbooks and military manuals still sit on the shelves while the walls are adorned with his sword, a fencing helmet and a collection of pistols.

The regiment's history, seen by the Guardian, records Rochereau's commander was killed by a bullet to the head after giving a 'heroic' order to counter-attack in Loker, which changed hands several times.  

Rochereau, a second lieutenant with the 15th Dragoons Regiment based in Libourne, near Bordeaux, received a posthumous croix de guerre medal for his extreme bravery on the battlefield.

He was one of 580,000 soldiers who died on that part of the western front in the 1914-18 war.

He is also remembered on the village war memorial and on a monument to the fallen in Libourne.

Current owner has respected their wishes and says if he sells he would seek a buyer willing to retain the tradition

But there are fears a future owner may decide to clear the room as the 500 years clause has no legal basis
