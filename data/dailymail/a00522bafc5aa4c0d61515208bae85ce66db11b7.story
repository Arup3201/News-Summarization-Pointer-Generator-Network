Taxpayers may have been overcharged by millions of pounds under a £700million criminal  tagging contract.

Auditors have been called in to examine payments to Serco and G4S, which monitor around 20,000 criminals at any one time.

Officials have ‘identified potential issues in relation to billing’, according to Justice Secretary Chris Grayling.

Taxpayers could have overpaid two private companies for their work tagging criminals

The concerns apparently relate to how many offenders were on tags and for how long.

PricewaterhouseCoopers will examine 
how the contract operated and analyse the figures supplied by Serco and 
G4S to the Ministry of Justice.

Both firms have pledged to repay any money claimed in error.

Justice Secretary Chris Grayling wants to expand the use of private companies in rehabilitation services

Mr Grayling said: ‘I take this issue 
very seriously and my  priority is to ensure that taxpayers’ money is 
spent appropriately and delivers value for money.’

The devices are put on suspects who are on bail and on criminals released early from prison under a home detention curfew.

Keith Vaz, chairman of the  Commons 
home affairs select committee, called for a full audit of all Justice 
Ministry contracts with Serco and G4S.

A tender process this year will see criminals given GPS tags to track their movements at all times.

The current system works only to alert controllers when the offender leaves home or takes the tag off.

The revelation is embarrassing for Mr 
Grayling as he prepares to rolls out to hand up to 70 per cent of 
probation services over to the private sector or charities.

Companies like G4S and Serco will be 
able to bid for payment-by-results contracts to supervise low to medium 
level offenders across England and Wales. The providers will be judged 
by whether or not they cut reoffending rates.

But
the use of firms like G4S have been thrown into the spotlight after it 
failed to provide thousands of guards to provide security for the London
Olympics, leading to the arm to be called in.

Now
an independent team is conduct an audit of electronic tagging 
contracts, including information from G4S and Serco. It is also 
examining how the contract was run by the Government department.

Mr Grayling: ‘I take this issue very seriously and my priority is to ensure that taxpayers' money is spent appropriately and delivers value for money.

‘As a result of information which has recently come to light as part of the retendering process for electronic monitoring contracts, my department has identified potential issues in relation to billing under the current contracts which were originally let in 2005.

‘Working with our suppliers, we are taking immediate action to address this.

‘We have asked a high-quality independent team to audit the processes and the information supplied to the department by G4S and Serco.’

The review is expected to report back within six weeks.

Electronic tagging is used as a method of monitoring offenders in the community and can be used to make sure criminals stick to court-imposed curfews.

The equipment consists of a tag, fitted to the offender's ankle, and a monitoring unit in the home or other place of curfew.

All movements in and out of the home, or other activities such as removal of the tag or tampering with the equipment, are reported to a control centre.

Mr Grayling added: ‘Our suppliers have told me that they take this seriously too, they are co-operating fully and they have given me clear assurances that if any adjustment is required to charges made to date, this will be put right promptly and repayments made.

‘Carrying out this audit does not impact on the operation of the electronic monitoring service, and its important role in protecting the public.’

Elaine Bailey, managing director at Serco Home Affairs, said: ‘Serco takes its responsibilities as a provider of public services extremely seriously.

‘We have every confidence that we deliver a good service to the Ministry of Justice on the electronic monitoring contract and we will co-operate fully with the audit announced by the Secretary of State.’

A G4S spokeswoman: ‘We believe that we are delivering our electronic monitoring (EM) service in a completely open and transparent way.

‘The EM service contracts have previously been audited by the National Audit Office, which concluded that our service offered “good value for money to the taxpayer”.’

The use of private firms for government contracts was thrown into the spotlight when G4S failed to recruit thousands of guards to provide security at the London Olympics

Serco said it was 'cooperating fully' with the investigation into payments by the Ministry of Justice

Keith Vaz, chairman of the home affairs select committee, said: ‘The Home Affairs Select Committee has warned the Government that companies that have failed to deliver ought to be monitored very carefully and that means complete monitoring.

‘The Ministry of Justice clearly failed to do so despite knowing the difficulties with G4S.

‘G4S and Serco currently hold 17 contracts with the Home Office and it is essential a complete audit of these contracts is now conducted.’
