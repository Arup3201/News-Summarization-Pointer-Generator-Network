Council workers will be paid thousands of pounds to park their cars - even if they do not drive to work, it was revealed today.

Staff will receive up to £800 each next year as compensation for moving to new offices with less parking - but the handout will be given even if workers walk, cycle or use public transport.

Eastleigh Borough Council in Hampshire will pay the sums to around 400 employees, because there are only six spaces at its new town centre headquarters.

Changing locations: The car park at the Eastleigh Borough Council offices in Hampshire. Staff will receive up to £800 each next year as compensation for moving to new offices with less parking

But angry tax campaigners have branded the payouts 'ridiculous'. It comes as the authority relocates from a site with free parking to a new £12million home less than two miles away.

The lowest paid staff will get £800 for the next three years, falling gradually to £267 by 2021/22 - a total of £4,801. Top earners will receive £533 for the first year, dropping to nothing by 2017/18.

Eleanor McGrath, of the TaxPayers' Alliance, said: ‘Moving the council offices might be a slight inconvenience for staff. But it is ridiculous that this allowance is going to those that catch the bus or bike to work.

‘Most local residents who commute pay 
for their own travel, so they will find it hard to swallow that their 
council tax is being used in this way.

‘At a time when budgets are 
tight, the council should focus on saving taxpayers' cash and delivering
frontline services, not paying for staff perks.’

Statement: The authority says its current home is in need of repair and moving to the 'more accessible' new site will be cheaper than refurbishing the old offices

Even the council's new chief executive will have to pay for parking at the new site, which only has three spaces for pool cars and three disabled bays.

Moving: The new offices for Eastleigh Borough Council in Hampshire are still being built

An annual parking permit in the town costs £1,067. Today, residents reacted in anger to the announcement.

Health carer Kate Omondi, 30, from Eastleigh, said other workers would find the payouts unfair.

She added: ‘Any other person who works in other town centre offices has to pay to park. People who already work there will feel it's unfair they have to pay but council workers don't. Why should we pay for their parking when we have to pay ourselves?’

The council defended the  'self-funding' scheme, saying its current home is in need of repair and moving to the 'more accessible' new site will be cheaper than refurbishing the old offices.

A council spokesman said: ‘This time-limited scheme recognises the transitional costs for staff in this move. The scheme will be self-funding and will not be a cost to borough residents over the life of the scheme.’

Councillors will be able to claim back parking fees on expenses.

Council leader Keith House said for some workers it would be more convenient if they lived in Eastleigh or because the building was close to rail and bus links.

But union chiefs said the payments showed 'contempt' for staff. Peter Terry, regional organiser for union Unison, argued staff would still face paying out more money, due to the parking permit cost.

He said: ‘It is saying to continue working for us you can pay £200 for the privilege - that's disgraceful.

‘These are staff having to do more, work harder because the demand is much greater on services and there's fewer staff doing it. It shows a contempt for the employees.’

The council spokesman said they could not put an overall figure on the payments, following the relocation next spring.

He added: 'The scheme would be self-funding and would likely not include staff who join after April. The report has been taken to cabinet but is still out for consultation.'
