Police officer Osman Iqbal was jailed after he was exposed him as being at the centre of an organised crime group which ran brothels in exclusive areas of London 

A police officer who led a secret double life as the boss of an organised crime gang was caught out by his own force bosses - after driving into work in a £170,000 Ferrari.

Osman Iqbal, 37, earned around £40,000 a year as a sergeant for West Midlands Police responding to 999 calls in Kings Heath, Birmingham.

But unbeknown to his colleagues he had links to a string of brothels and peddled class A drugs in exclusive areas of London.

Iqbal is now serving a jail sentence of seven years and two months after being imprisoned last September with seven other gang members.

His own workmates raised suspicions when Iqbal arrived for work in the £170,000 Ferrari 458 supercar and an anti-corruption team began probing his bank accounts. 

A court last September heard how Iqbal was caught when the Serious and Organised Crime Unit linked him with convicted armed robber Talib Hussain, 33.

It was through him that he had access to a fleet of high end vehicles and both men and the cars were connected to to two fake businesses - City Chauffeurs Ltd and Capital Event Management.

The bank accounts of the companies were being used by the pair to launder hundreds of thousands of pounds.

Police discovered the money was coming from chip and PIN machines in Covent Garden and Marylebone in London.

Two properties were put under surveillance in a joint operation with the Metropolitan Police and they were identified as brothels.

Iqbal and Hussain and their associates Atif Hussain and Asri Hussain were involved in an elaborate scheme whereby they organised for clients to be picked up from strip bars where they would be offered drugs and women and driven back to one of the brothels.

Once there they were overcharged on their bank cards  - but failed to report the crimes because of the shame of how they had been duped.

On September 19 2014 he was sentenced to seven years, two months after admitting conspiracy to manage a brothel, conspiracy to possess Class A drugs with intent to supply and conspiracy to money launder.

More recently the force discovered that he had been asked by Nahiem Ajmal, a Birmingham religious leader, to get information from police computer systems on behalf of his friend Sajad Khan.

Although due to safeguarding in place he was unable to access the police log he was charged with five counts of misconduct in a public office and pleaded guilty to three counts at an earlier hearing. 

He was back in court on Wednesday where he faced three new charges of misconduct in a public office.

Iqbal, of  Birmingham, pleaded guilty and admitted making unauthorised attempts to access police intelligence systems while serving with West Midlands police.

Iqbal's cousins Talib Hussain, and Atif Hussain admitted conspiring to act or assist in the management of a brothel. Talib, 34, of Hodge Hill, was jailed for eight years and four months. Atif, 27, of Saltley, was jailed for four years and two months 

He will be sentenced at a later date. 

Chief Inspector Martin Brennan, from West Midlands Police's Serious and Organised Crime Unit, said the cars and greed gave the men away.

He said: 'This was a highly-organised and well-orchestrated criminal network but what makes it particularly reprehensible is that fact a serving police officer was at the centre of it all.

'Iqbal and his associates generated their income by running 'exclusive' brothels and peddling Class A drugs.

'For them, it was all about the money and the fast cars and they didn't care who they were exploiting and what laws they were breaking in the process.

Cousin Asri, 25, was also jailed for three years – consecutive to a ten-year sentence he received for conspiracy to commit robberies

'Their greed was their downfall and when they were seen driving around in their supercars it didn't take us long to piece together exactly what they were up to and take action.

'We constantly target networks like this and it doesn't matter who's involved, we will seek to use the full weight of the law against them.'

Iqbal's cousins, brothers Talib, Atif and Asri Hussain, admitted conspiring to act or assist in the management of a brothel.

They also pleaded guilty to possessing cocaine with intent to supply it at the two brothels they ran.

Iqbal, Talib and Atif Hussain admitted being involved in the conspiracy to launder the proceeds.

Talib, 34, of Hodge Hill,  was jailed for eight years and four months.

Atif, 27, of Saltley, was jailed for four years and two months.

Asri, 25, of the same address, was jailed for three years – consecutive to a ten-year sentence he received for conspiracy to commit robberies.

Iqbal’s sister Raheela Ali, 44, and her husband Nassar Ali, 50, of Ilford, Essex, were also jailed after earlier being found guilty of conspiring to assist in the management of brothels and to launder the proceeds.

Raheela was jailed for a year after. Her husband, who changed his pleas to guilty part-way through the trial, received 21 months.
