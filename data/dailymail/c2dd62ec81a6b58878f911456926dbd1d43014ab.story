The declining fortunes of child actors as they move into adulthood has become a sadly familiar story in Hollywood.

But the tragic life of one, Manuel Benitez, who died in a shoot-out with police in a Californian restaurant in 2008 - after allegedly killing his girlfriend and kidnapping his own son - was so unusual it has been made into a hard-hitting TV documentary.

At the peak of his acting career in the 1980s Benitez, whose screen name was 'Mark Everett,' seemed to have it all, starring in popular films including 'Stand and Deliver' and 'Pee-Wee's Big Adventure.' But when his Hollywood career came to an end his life began a downward spiral.

The story of Benitez's fall from grace has been profiled as part of the Final Cut series which is broadcast by the Investigation Discovery television network.

During the 1990s, Benitez - who was reportedly the illegitimate son of a bullfighter - started a relationship with a woman called Stephanie Spears and the couple had a son together.

He was arrested on drug charges in 2000 and convicted for possession of a concealed and illegal loaded firearm in 2003, and was sentenced to probation.

His relationship with Ms Spears had also apparently begun to deteriorate.

He allegedly bludgeoned her to death 
with a dumbbell in front of their son at their home in California in 
2004, after trying to leave with the child while Ms Spears was asleep.

The FBI offered a reward of up to $20,000 for information leading to Benitez's arrest and he featured on America's Most Wanted several times - but he remained at large.

He was finally cornered at a restaurant in El Monte California on December 23, 2008.

Police arrived at the eatery after receiving a call about a suspicious man with a child.

A hostage standoff then ensued with Benitez barricading himself inside the restaurant's bathroom with his son.

He is reported to have told police that he was going to shoot them and harm the boy.

A worker at a nearby Mexican restaurant said Benitez had his son in a headlock and had been holding a gun to his head.

Streets surrounding the restaurant were closed off by the police as dozens of emergency personnel gathered at the scene.

After throwing a flash grenade inside the restaurant police engaged Benitez in a gunfight in which he was killed. His son was shot in the thigh but survived.

The former child actor was found to have a semi-automatic gun and a revolver on him.
