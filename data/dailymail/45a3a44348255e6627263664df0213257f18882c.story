The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are to hire a maternity nurse to help them care for their second child.

Despite opting not to have one when Prince George was born, The Mail on Sunday has learned that William and Kate will follow Royal tradition this time.

Aides are understood to have enquired at the London-based Norland Agency and Royal Nannies about a full-time maternity nurse for at least three months after the birth.

Although the Duchess has a full-time nanny for 18-month-old George, she wants additional help for her second child, which is due in April. Kate is said to be keen to resume her charity work 'as quickly as possible'.

A live-in maternity nurse carries out all duties relating to the care of mother and baby in the first few weeks after a birth.

A source said: 'Kate and William loved the early weeks with Prince George but it was hard work and the sleepless nights took their toll. Kate especially was exhausted.'

In September 2014, the Duke and Duchess began to make arrangements to hire a professional in the early stage's of their second child's birth.

The Royal couple relied largely on their family members for help following the birth of Prince George.

A friend of the Prince and Princess said at the time:  'There is a nanny annex and a guest suite with plenty of space for Kate's family... Kate and William plan to go to their own family home after the birth.'

A spokesman for the couple declined to comment.
