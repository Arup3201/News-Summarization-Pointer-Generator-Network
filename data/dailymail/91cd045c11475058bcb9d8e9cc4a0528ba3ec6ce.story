Bechard had approached uniformed Secret Service officers at a White House security checkpoint at about 3 p.m. EDT/1900 GMT and then 'proceeded to get fully undressed,' the spokesman said.

Officers subdued the man, covered him and sent him to a hospital for treatment of minor injuries suffered in the tussle, according to The Daily Caller.

Daily Caller reporter Ariel Cohen, who was entering the White House through the same checkpoint, said the man had told the Secret Service officers he had a 3 p.m. appointment with President Barack Obama and presented his identification.The reporter said the ID was rejected because it was from a foreign country and the man then began undressing while insisting that he had to keep his appointment with Obama.

According to Cohen, Secret Service agents 'constrained [Bechard] and covered his naked body with a foil blanket' before both fire and police personnel arrived.

According to a report by CNN, the White House did not go into lockdown.

Video shows Bechard wearing pants and covered in the blanket while he is led away by officers.
