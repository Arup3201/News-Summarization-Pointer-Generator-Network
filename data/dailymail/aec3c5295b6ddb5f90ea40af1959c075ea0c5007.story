Colin Powell has labeled George Zimmerman's acquittal in the slaying of Florida teenager Trayvon Martin 'questionable' and urged President Barack Obama to be 'more passionate' about race issues.

In an interview aired on Sunday night, the first black Secretary of State and chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff said Martin Luther King Jr. would insist 'the dream is not fully achieved yet,' if he were alive today.

Mr Powell spoke as Washington marked the 50th anniversary of Mr King's march that included the iconic 'I Have a Dream' speech.

'If Dr. King was here, I'm quite sure
he would say, "Congratulations on all the progress that's been made, 
but let's keep going. The dream is not fully achieved yet,"' said 
Powell.

In the interview on
CBS' 'Face the Nation,' Mr Powell referred to the jury's verdict in the 
Trayvon Martin case, which sparked heated protests around the nation. A 
Florida jury found George Zimmerman acted in self-defense and acquitted 
him during a criminal trial.

However, he believes it will soon be forgotten and questioned its impact on the civil rights discourse.

'I
think that it will be seen as a questionable judgment on the part of 
the judicial system down there, but I don't know if it will have staying
power,' Powell said. 'These cases come along and they blaze across the 
midnight sky and then after a period of time, they're forgotten.'

That
doesn't mean Obama should keep silent, though, Powell said, adding that
the nation's first black president, and all presidents, had a 
responsibility to discuss the nation's history of racial injustice.

'I'd
like to see him be more passionate about race questions,' Powell said 
of Obama, whom he endorsed during the 2008 and 2012 presidential 
election.

'For the 
president to speak out on it is appropriate. I think all leaders, black 
and white, should speak out on this issue,' the Republican added.

Powell
said he didn't fully grasp the civil rights upheaval happening during 
the early 1960s until he returned from Vietnam. His wife, Alma, didn't 
share the developments with him from their home in Birmingham, Alabama, 
and his service blocked him from engaging in the political upheaval.

He said the civil rights era helped blacks but more needs to be done.

'A
lot has been accomplished, and we should be so proud of our 
accomplishments,' he said.

'But at the same time, that mirror should 
show us that there are still problems in this country, that there is 
still racial bias that still exists in certain parts of our country.'
