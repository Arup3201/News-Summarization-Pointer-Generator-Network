Man's world? Glenn Cosby, the last male in Great British Bake Off, has been voted off the show, sparking accusations that the show favours women

Some say the days when women ruled the roost in the kitchen have been consigned to the past.

But they have clearly not been paying attention to this year’s Great British Bake Off.

The hit baking show has been accused of favouritism towards its female contestants after the last man was eliminated from the series with three episodes still remaining.

A string of male viewers – including celebrity chef Nigel Slater and two former competitors – complained after teacher Glenn Cosby, 37, was voted off this week’s show, leaving five women to compete in next week’s quarter final.

One - last year’s runner up James Morton - said his faith in the show was ‘completely lost’ and threatened to start watching Channel 4 show Grand Designs instead.

He added: ‘Should be renamed ‘Great British Bloke Off’.

Tuesday’s episode was watched by 6.3million viewers, a series record and the second highest audience in the BBC2 show’s history.

But its 1.9million male fans saw the last remaining male baker struggle with his puff pastry and watch in dismay when his showstopper mille-feuille collapsed in a sticky mess.

Mr Crosby was the fourth man to be voted off in a row, prompting dismay among male viewers.

Writing on Twitter, Mr Morton said: 'First Howard. Now Glenn. Faith in #GBBO completely lost. Next week, I’m watching Grand Designs.

'Last man standing in #GBBO is sent packing. An all-women show from now on. Should be re-named “Great British Bloke Off”.’

Celebrity chef Nigel Slater was equally disappointed, saying: ‘I SO didn’t want that to happen. #GBBO so disappointing such a lovely man!’

And the winner of the first Bake Off series, Edd Kimber, also showed his allegiances were with the last remaining man, saying: ‘Oh no @GlennCosby so sorry to see you go, you’ve been absolutely fabulous! #gbbo.’

The Bake Off crown will now be contested by Beca Lyne-Pirkis, Christine Wallace, Frances Quinn, Kimberley Wilson and Ruby Tandoh.

Some suspicious viewers suggested they owed their success to favouritism from judges Mary Berry and Paul Hollywood rather than their own merits.

Last week, some noticed ‘sexual tension’ between 47-year-old Hollywood – who split from his wife in May – and 21-year-old Miss Tandoh.

Now viewers complained the attractive philosophy student, who is a former model, was treated differently to the others.

One Tweeted: ‘Ruby gets way to much favouritism from Paul and Mary.’

Another added: ‘I hope Paul Hollywood doesn’t do his usual flirtatious favouritism with Ruby again this week, it’s getting tiresome.’

A third said: ‘I am actually considering stopping watching #GBBO I have never seen anything so blatantly fixed in one person’s favour.’

Two of the three Bake Off series so far have been won by men, with last year’s final an all-male affair.

But many male viewers said this year’s series showed the traditional sexual roles have been re-established.

One said: ‘This program proves that men are crap cooks & a woman’s place is well & truly in the kitchen. Birds 5 Blokes 0. #GBBO #TakeCover.’

A female fan replied: ‘Women ARE the best bakers! #GBBO.’
