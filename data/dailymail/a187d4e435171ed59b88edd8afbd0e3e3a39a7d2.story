It seems the audience for Will Smith's post-apocalyptic After Earth is already nearly extinct.

The film, starring Smith and his son Jaden, opened Friday to universally bad reviews, making only $27 million at third place for the weekend, according to The Associated Press.

Based on Smith's own original story, the movie centers on a father and son after the pair, played by real-life father and son Smith and Jaden, crash land on Earth a thousand years after humans abandon the planet when it is devastated by global warming.

Poor showing: Will Smith's futuristic flick After Earth, staring him and his son Jaden, pictured, was third place at the box office its opening weekend after universally bad reviews

In a zero-star review of the piece, New York Daily News film critic Joe Neumaier said the movie was this summer’s first 'bomb,' calling it a 'crashing bore'.

'Lurking in every corner of After 
Earth are poky action scenes, sketchy plot details, lazy logistics, 
junky sci-fi mumbo jumbo and dull-as-rice attacks by futuristic 
baboons,' Neumaier said.

In its review, The Wall Street Journal even asks, 'Is After Earth the worst movie ever made?'

Maybe not, but 'It…is…all…very…mysterious…and…deeply…dreary,' film critic Joe Morgenstern concluded.

Disappointing: After Earth, starring Will and Jaden Smith, performed below expectations its opening weekend, according to Sony's president of worldwide distribution

Sony Pictures, which distributed the film, even admitted they were disappointed by the flick’s initial showing.

'It’s below our expectations here 
domestically,' Rory Bruer, Sony's president of worldwide distribution, 
told The Associated Press.

But Bruer added its worldwide release next week will show improvement. 

'We feel very good about the 
potential of the film on a worldwide basis,' he told The Associated 
Press. 'It will open 60 countries next week.'

Summer of sequels: Fast & Furious 6 raced ahead After Earth at the box office, remaining in first place and making $34.5 million its second weekend in the U.S.

After Earth's poor opening weekend 
might be attributed to the success of flashy sequel Fast & Furious 
6. The car-jacking action film remained at the top of the box office for
the second weekend in a row since its release in the U.S. on May 24.

Fast & Furious 6 made $120 
million its opening weekend and another $34.5 million this weekend, 
according to The Associated Press.

Now You See Me, about a group of magician bank-robbers, took second place in its opening weekend, making $28.1 million.
