Product criticism: Alan Titchmarsh pictured in a publicity photograph for his Waitrose gardening line

For many of us, Alan Titchmarsh is the go-to gardening expert, a font of knowledge about making things grow.

But when it comes to making compost, it seems he is not quite the master we might assume.

Consumer magazine Which? Gardening has condemned his commercial Peat-Free Multi Purpose Compost - part of a gardening line recently launched by Waitrose - as a product to stay away from.

In a review of 25 composts, Which? gave Mr Titchmarsh’s £3.50 30-litre bag a ‘Don’t Buy’ label. Experts gave his compost poor scores for seed sowing and raising young plants.

They said tomatoes, pansies, basil plants and pelargoniums all did badly in trials.

Ceri Thomas, editor of Which? Gardening, said on Twitter that the reviews revealed a ‘shocking difference between a Best Buy compost and a Don’t Buy’.

Mr Titchmarsh, 65, who made his name as a television presented in the 1980s on the long-running BBC Nationwide, last night rejected the criticism.

In a statement sent by his agent, he said: ‘The results obtained by Which? magazine do not accord with my own experiences at home which prove this compost to be the best peat-free mix I have ever used.

‘That’s why I was - and am - happy to it my name to it. Perhaps other gardeners are best advised to try it and make their own judgements.’

Waitrose, which launched a gardening range fronted by Mr Titchmarsh in Spring 2013, also disputed the scores.

A spokesman for the supermarket said: ‘We were very disappointed to read the review as it doesn’t reflect what we see in our own and independent stringent quality control testing or the positive feedback we receive from our customers.

‘We work with a leading compost manufacturer and pride ourselves on providing consistently outstanding composts and we’ll investigate these results further.’

Gardeners are divided about the strengths and weaknesses of peat-free compost.

Environmentalists insist we stop using any peat in our gardens, because digging it up for commercial use is destroying the moors where it comes from.

While many experts say peat-free compost is just as good as traditional peat mixes, others say decomposed bark and green waste is too coarse to germinate seeds well.

The BBC was criticised in 2013 for allowing Mr Titchmarsh to present Chelsea Flower Show coverage while being the face of Waitrose, a sponsor at the event.

He was dropped the next year, in favour of Monty Don. Mr Titchmarsh said later: ‘Yes, I suppose I was hurt, because I know people enjoy you doing it as much as I loved doing it.’
