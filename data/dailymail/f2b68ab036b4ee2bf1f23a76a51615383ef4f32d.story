Ed Miliband was confronted by an angry campaigner yesterday who said his elderly mother had died after suffering neglect under the Labour-run NHS in Wales.

Gareth Williams told the Labour leader, on the first week of his campaign trail, that his party’s stewardship of the Health Service was a ‘national disgrace’ and patients were dying needlessly.

His mother Lillian Williams died in 2012 aged 82 at the Princess of Wales Hospital in Bridgend, where her family claim she was left without water, not helped to take her medication, and was withheld treatment for pneumonia without their consent.

Her son called on Mr Miliband to investigate the catalogue of failings by holding a public inquiry like the one at Mid Staffordshire.

The Health Service, which is devolved to the Welsh government in Cardiff, has come under devastating criticism for its soaring waiting lists and slow ambulance response times.

Earlier this year, bosses were accused of trying to cover up high death rates when they were told by NHS medical director Sir Bruce Keogh to investigate six hospitals and apparently failed to act. 

And last year Labour MP Ann Clwyd made a series of complaints after her husband died ‘like a battery hen’ at the University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff.
