A TV soap star who wanted to prove to his girlfriend that he was bisexual raped and sexually assaulted a young boy, a court heard yesterday.

The teenage actor, who cannot be identified because of his age, is accused of forcing himself on the 14-year-old boy, a fellow pupil at a stage school, during a rehearsal at a theatre.

He allegedly grabbed the boy, dragged him down the stairs to a fire escape and performed a sex act on him.

Court hearing: A 17-year-old child soap star is on trial at Blackfriars Crown Court, pictured, for allegedly molesting a fellow student at a stage school in London over two months in 2010

The next day the actor’s girlfriend blocked the doors in the same stairwell and watched as he raped the boy, a court heard.

Just before the second alleged attack,
the actor told the boy that they ‘needed to show (his girlfriend)’ what
they had done. The actor’s girlfriend had also urged the boy to ‘do it 
for me’, Blackfriars Crown Court in London heard.

Giving evidence yesterday, the boy said: ‘I said we didn’t need to show her anything, I said I need to get out.’

Timothy Forster, prosecuting, asked: ‘Could you get out?’

The boy replied: ‘No, (the girlfriend) was sitting against the doors. She was saying “do it for me”.  I said I didn’t want to.’

The boy told the court he only stopped the attack by biting the actor and forcing his way past the girlfriend and fleeing.

After the alleged attacks, the  boy said he felt shocked, scared  and embarrassed.

Asked why he did not immediately tell 
anyone about what had happened, he replied: ‘I was just scared and 
worried what other people would think. I was more scared that I would 
not know how to say it.’

The attacks are said to have taken place in July, 2010.

The court was told that the actor had also approached the boy and sexually assaulted him in a toilet in September 2010.

The prosecutor told the court that 
further incidents took place on a weekly basis over a six-month period, 
‘none of which he wanted’.

The boy collapsed while giving evidence behind a screen in court on Monday and so yesterday gave evidence via video.

Jurors heard how the TV actor’s 
girlfriend first approached the boy during a rehearsal and broached the 
subject of the boy’s sexuality.

The same day the actor told him he was ‘bi’ and asked him to ‘come downstairs’, but the boy refused, the court heard.

After that the actor sent a string of 
text messages to the boy saying ‘that he had to prove to (his 
girlfriend) that he was bi and saying that he wanted to “do it” with 
(him) and do it so that (his girlfriend) could watch,’ Mr Forster said.

The boy told the court he could not remember the first person he told about the attacks.

He did, however, recall a conversation with a friend who claimed the actor had been asking about his own sexuality.

‘(The friend) spoke to me about it,’ the boy said.

‘He was saying (the defendant) was 
asking him whether he was gay and whether he would do stuff and he was 
telling me about that,’ he told the court.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
