Atletico Madrid are interested in taking their former captain back to the Vicente Calderon after selling star striker Diego Costa to Torres' current side Chelsea.

Chelsea are willing to cash in on Torres if a bid in the region of £20million comes in for him.

Jose Mourinho is likely to play one upfront with Costa likely to be the number one striker at Stamford Bridge next season.

Torres' chance of regular first team football will diminish even further if Didier Drogba seals a return to the west London outfit.
