Environment Secretary Owen Paterson claimed the benefits of GM crops went beyond the food chain

A PR campaign to change the image of genetically modified food is to be launched by the government.

Environment Secretary Owen Paterson wants farmers, scientists and ministers to increase the appeal of so-called Frankenstein Foods among the public.

In a speech today to the Oxford Farming Conference, Mr Paterson insists there are ‘great opportunities’ in pushing GM technology , but admitted the public need reassurance that it is safe.

Since last summer’s reshuffle, Mr Paterson has repeatedly backed GM’s role in keeping food supplies secure.

He has dismissed complaints as ‘humbug’ and claimed ‘there isn’t a single piece of meat being served [in a typical London restaurant] where a bullock hasn’t eaten some GM feed’.

GM crops were grown on 395 million acres in 29 countries in 2011, according to the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs.

In today’s speech Mr Paterson said: ‘I fully appreciate the strong feelings on both sides of the debate. GM needs to be considered in its proper overall context with a balanced understanding of the risks and benefits.

‘We should not, however, be afraid of making the case to the public about the potential benefits of GM beyond the food chain, for example, significantly reducing the use of pesticides and inputs such as diesel.

‘As well as making the case at home, we also need to go through the rigorous processes that the EU has in place to ensure the safety of GM crops.

‘I believe that GM offers great opportunities but I also recognise that we owe a duty to the public to reassure them that it is a safe and beneficial innovation.’

Brits who got behind Team GB in the London Olympics should now back the nation's farmers, Owen Paterson said.

The Environment Secretary said 22 per cent of the food that could be produced in the UK is imported.

He said: 'Each year we bring in 115,000 tonnes of 
ice cream – more than double the 50,000 we send abroad, 150,000 tonnes 
of yoghurt – six times the 25,000 we export. British fruit and vegetable
 growers are in a similar position.

'We
 can all do more and, just as everyone got behind Team GB last summer, 
we must get behind our food producers.

'By buying British, we boost the 
rural economy and enjoy some of the best quality produce in the world.'

He said the industry ‘has long been at the forefront of innovation’ and this must continue, including backing GM.

But opponents of an expansion in GM technology claimed just a quarter of people thought it could be 'encouraged'.

Peter Melchett, policy director of 
the Soil Association, said: 'Owen Patterson says that people are eating meat from animals fed of GM feed without realising it.

'That is because the British Government has consistently opposed moves to label to give consumers accurate information, and he should put that right by immediately introducing compulsory labelling of meat and milk from animals fed on GM feed.'

Friends of the Earth's senior food and farming campaigner Clare Oxborrow said: 'GM crops are not the solution to the food challenges we face.

'They are largely being developed to benefit multinational biotech firms that are gaining control of the seed industry, not to feed poor people in developing countries.'

In his speech in Oxford, Mr Paterson admitted that farming had suffered a ‘tough year’ of floods, high feed costs and diseases such as bovine TB and Schmallenberg.

But he said the industry in the UK produces food for 63.5 million people and supports industries that add nearly £90 billion to the UK economy.

And he pledged that the government must ‘get out of people’s hair and let them get on with what they are good at’.

‘I want our farmers to be farming not form-filling,’ he said, pledging to further reduce the burden of paperwork.

While demanding major reform of the EU's Commons Agriculture Policy, he defended giving public money to farmers.

'I do believe that there is a role for taxpayer’s money in compensating farmers for the work they do in enhancing the environment and providing public goods for which there is no market mechanism.

'Farming makes a real contribution to our habitats and wildlife.  We must be able to continue to develop our agri-environment schemes.'
