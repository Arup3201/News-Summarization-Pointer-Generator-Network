Bristol Palin's five minutes of fame appeared to be up after her much-hyped reality show was dropped from its prime-time slot and replaced with re-runs.

The first four episodes of Bristol Palin: Life's A Tripp, featuring the daughter of former vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, attracted less than 750,000 viewers.

Executives at the Lifetime channel 
pulled the reality series from its 10pm slot on Tuesdays and banished it
to 11pm.

Game over: Bristol Palin: Life's A Tripp has been dropped from its prime time spot

Unsuccessful: The show featured 22-year-old Bristol and her three year old son, Tripp and centered on their new life in a Los Angeles mansion after moving from the family home in Alaska

The show was expected to perform better since it aired after the hugely popular series Dance Moms.

The decision means the reality show will almost certainly not be picked up for a second series - and spells the end of Bristol's TV career.

The show featured 22-year-old Bristol and her three-year-old son, Tripp and centered on their new life in a Los Angeles mansion after moving from the family home in Alaska.

But viewers were not taken by the series
with critics saying Palin simply sat by her swimming pool moaning about
the problems of being a single mother.

The show was mired in controversy when Palin's Dancing With The Stars co-star Kyle Massey and his brother Chris filed a lawsuit against producers, claiming that they came up with the show's premise and were slated to star opposite Palin.

Palin is also being sued for defamation by a man who got into a spat with her at a bar after insulting her mother.

Stephen Hanks filed a lawsuit claiming he did not sign a release form agreeing to appear on television.

Alternative schedule: Palin's failed show will be replaced by Dance Moms

Replaced: Dance Moms will take over the 10pm slot, with Palin's show banished to an 11pm slot

Bristol became a household name when she was 18 years old and gave birth to Tripp out of wedlock.

Her pregnancy came as her mother Sarah stood as the Republican vice presidential candidate in 2008.

She went on to appear on Dancing With The Stars and the reality series called Sarah Palin's Alaska.
