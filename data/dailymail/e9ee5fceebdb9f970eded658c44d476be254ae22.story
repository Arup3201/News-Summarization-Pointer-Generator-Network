A Pennsylvania bride accused of killing her niece after the wedding has been ordered to stand trial on homicide and aggravated assault charges.

Charges against newlywed Christina George-Harvan, 30, were sent to Beaver County court after her preliminary hearing on Friday. She is being held without bail.

George-Harvan, of Conway, allegedly shot 21-year-old Katelyn Francis on April 24 as they left a bar in New Brighton, about 30 miles north of Pittsburgh. The wedding was held earlier that day.

Christina George-Harvan, 30, is driven away in a police car still wearing her wedding dress after she allegedly shot her niece on April 24

Police said the newlyweds and Francis were arguing about who would be the designated driver when the bride picked up a gun from her husband's truck and shot Francis, of Fairmont, West Virginia.

Defense attorney Stephen Colafella said his client simply tried to move the gun when it went off.

The shooting took place just hours after George-Harvan tied the knot with new husband, Jeremy Harvan.

The
 three were in the parking lot of Jimmy K's Bar and Grille when they got
 into a fight about who was going to drive and George-Harvan pulled out a
 pistol and shot Francis, authorities say.

Killed: 21-year-old Katie Francis died on the way to the hospital after being shot by her aunt in a fight over who was going to drive last month. Friends of Francis say she had a son named Kody, and is pictured in her Facebook profile picture with a young boy

'Everybody
 in the bar noticed that there was something going on with the people, 
but nobody knew exactly what was happening,' witness James Botinovich 
told KDKA.

'The next thing you know we heard someone got shot...looked out, noticed it was right by my car.'

Police
 responded to the scene and arrested George-Harvan,
 booking her in Beaver County Jail for the first night of her honeymoon.Â 

Paramedics rushed Francis to UPMC Presbyterian, but she died en route.

Miss Francis was from Fairview, West Virginia, a small town 75 miles south of Pittsburgh.

The gun which was used in the fatal shooting belonged to new groom Jeremy Harvan (pictured at his wife's hearing on Friday)

Deanne Chenoweth, a friend and former co-worker of the victim, told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette
 that Francis was a single mother who left behind a young son named 
Kody.

Before her death, Chenoweth says Katelyn worked as a cashier at a 
Shop 'n Save grocery store.

While
 her aunt has been identified as Christina George-Harvan, the suspect's 
legal name may be Francis as well since she registered for a marriage 
license as Christina N Francis, of Conway, Pennsylvania.

Her new husband is from Freedom and the .9mm Glock is registered to his name.

Scene: George-Harvan, her new husband and Francis went out drinking to celebrate the marriage at Jimmy K's bar in New Brighton and subsequently got into a fight over who would drive home
