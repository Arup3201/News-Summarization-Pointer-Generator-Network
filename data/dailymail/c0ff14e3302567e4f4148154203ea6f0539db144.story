A grass snake had to be rescued by a vet when it got stuck trying to squeeze through a drain with a frog in its throat.

The two-foot long snake was carried to Sidmouth Veterinary Practice in Devon - still stuck in the metal grid - after a man spotted the reptile trapped in the grating in his garden.

It had just swallowed a frog which added a couple of inches to its girth.

The grass snake had to be rescued by a vet when it got stuck in a garden drain in Devon with a frog in its throat

Measuring about two ft  in length, the snake became stuck after eating something which added a couple of inches to its girth

Surgeon Richard Jones planned to cut off the grid with a hacksaw but then slipped the snake free with some lubricant.

The two-foot snake decided against swallowing the frog and regurgitated it shortly after being freed.

It was then released back into the garden where it was found. 

Mr Jones said: 'A gentleman found the snake stuck in a drain in his garden and brought it into us.

'It had become completely stuck. It was clear it had eaten something as it had an extra couple of inches around it's girth.

'I thought I was going to have to soar off the grate but after using lots of lubricant, I managed to free it within around 10 minutes.'

He added: 'It was absolutely fine but regurgitated the frog soon after.

'The gentleman then took the snake home and released it back into his garden.' 

Measuring up to 6ft long grass snakes are the largest species of snake in Britain, but unlike adders they are not venomous.

They pose no threat to humans but they are dangerous to the small animals on which they feast because of their speed and quick reflexes.

As the only species of snake in Britain to lay eggs, they have jaws big enough to regularly swallow small animals whole. 

But they are preyed on too, and play dead when cornered by predators.

The snakes subsist mainly on amphibious animals like frogs, toads and newts, as well as the occasional fish.
