A heroic Bourbon Street bartender who locked down his bar in the midst of Sunday's shocking shootout and came to the aid of a wounded woman is speaking out about his ordeal.

James Burgin, who was taking a break from his job at the Tropical Isle when shots rang out, is seen in surveillance footage rushing to help the Arkansas woman who was shot in the abdomen as two men imperiled countless innocent revelers during their early morning gunfight.

Police have released what they believe is separate surveillance footage that shows one of those shooters rushing down a New Orleans street around the time of the shooting and hope citizens might help identify him.

Hero: Bourbon Street bartender James Burgin rushed to first slam closed his bar's doors when shots rang out during Sunday morning's shootout. He then rushed to the aid of an injured woman

Running for their lives: Bystanders fled as bullets flew on Sunday

Horrific: For a while, no one seemed to notice that a woman in their midst had been shot and was grasping in terror the wound on her abdomen

She ended up okay: Only Burgis came to the unidentified Arkansas woman's aid after she fell to the ground in pain

Police on Monday also added a 10th victim, a man who had gone to a station in a neighboring district about 12 hours after the shootings to report that he had been shot.

When shots rang out around 2:45 Sunday, Burgin was as shocked as anyone.

'I was in the back of the bar taking a cigarette break when all of a sudden I heard a lot of gunshots, it had to be like more than 8 of them,' he told WWLT.

Person of interest: New Orleans police have developed a potential suspect in this man, who is seen in surveillance footage walking quickly down the street around the time of the shooting

In spite of his fear, the heroic bartender is seen in surveillance footage rushing to barricade the bar doors as terrified bystanders rush by.

It is then when Burgin notices a wounded woman on the floor holding her abdomen.

'I was just wanting to see how bad off she was,' says Burgin. 'I asked her if she was able to breathe OK and if she could feel her legs. She told me everything was OK as far as that goes, it just really hurt bad.'

Shocking: A victim lies in the streets of New Orleans after a shooter injured nine people early Sunday morning

Gunfire: Seven people were injured early Sunday morning following a shooting on New Orleans' Bourbon Street

Damage: A bullet hole is seen in the door of a business at the scene of the shooting

Altercation: Police say the shooting was carried out by two men who got into a fight. Above, the scene of the shooting outside Boubon Heat night club  

Police superintendent Ronal Serpas held a press conference this afternoon and said he is confident the two men will be arrested.

He
 said the two young men were armed with firearms and 'chose to settle 
their dispute with no regard to others. We know more about them than 
they think.'

One witness told WWL-TV that the shooter appeared to target one person, and then opened fire into a crowd.

'Just turned around and he started 
shooting at the crowd. He seemed pissed off at some dude, pulled the gun
 out and started shooting at the guy then turned around on the crowd and
 started shooting at us.'

The incident happened in the heart of the French Quarter tourist district, just steps away from famed jazz venue Preservation Hall, bar Pat O'Brien's and Cafe Du Monde.

Bullets: A street camera captured the shooting and the moments leading up to it - before people began to run for cover

Run for cover: The moment shots began to ring out, people on Bourbon Street ran to take cover

Cleared out: In the few moments after the shooting, Bourbon Street is left empty as people hid in nearby businesses

Shooter: One witness told WWL-TV that the shooter seemed to target one person before opening fire on a crowd

Help: After the shooting stopped, people ran to treat one of the people wounded in the attack

9-1-1: Just a few minutes after the shooting, emergency crews arrived to treat those hit injured in the shooting

An investigation is ongoing. Robertson said no arrests have been made, and no suspects have been identified. Robertson said other details will be released when they become available.

New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu on Sunday pledged a swift law-enforcement response.

'Our No. 1 priority is to keep New Orleans safe,' Landrieu said in a statement issued through City Hall spokesman Tyler Gamble. 'These kinds of incidents will not go unanswered ... I am confident that between video evidence and eyewitness accounts, we will bring the perpetrators to justice.'

Sunday morning's incident is the third major shooting on Bourbon Street in the last three years.

Last February on the Saturday before Mardi Gras, four people were treated at a hospital after a shooting. During Halloween in 2011, one person was killed and seven others were injured after gunmen opened fire on each other.
