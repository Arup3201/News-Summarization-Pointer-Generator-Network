Giant pandas could advance the development of biofuels thanks to microbes found in their faeces.

A pair of pandas at Memphis Zoo are contributing their waste in the name of scientific research, which aims to develop biofuels of the future.

The pandas' contribution could be added to by others from Toronto Zoo as scientists endeavour to shift biofuel production away from corn and other crops that are grown to be eaten and to non-food plant material instead.

Ya Ya and Le Le's faeces could help scientists work out how to shift biofuel production away from corn and other crops grown to be eaten

Ashli Brown, of Mississippi State University, who is leading the research told the 246th National Meeting & Exposition of the American Chemical Society, said that the pandas are giving their faeces to the study.

'We have discovered microbes in panda feces might actually be a solution to the search for sustainable new sources of energy,' she said.

'It's amazing that here we have an endangered species that's almost gone from the planet, yet there's still so much we have yet to learn from it. That underscores the importance of saving endangered and threatened animals.'

She has identified more than 40 microbes living in the guts of giant pandas at the Memphis Zoo that could make biofuel production from plant waste easier and cheaper.

The research, Professor Brown added, also may provide important new information for keeping giant pandas healthy.

Ethanol made from corn is the most common alternative fuel in the U.S. but many fear that wide use of corn, soybeans and other food crops used for fuel production may raise food prices or lead to shortages of food.

Professor Brown pointed out that corn stalks, corn cobs and other plant material not used for food production would be better sources of ethanol.

Scientists are keen on developing biofuels from non-food plants but tough stalks can be expensive to process. Professor Brown is examining bacteria that are highly efficient in breaking down lignocellulose and freeing up the material that can be fermented into ethanol and used in biofuels

However, that currently requires special processing to break down the tough lignocellulose material in plant waste and other crops, such as switchgrass, grown specifically for ethanol production.

Breaking down this material is costly and requires a pretreatment step using heat and high pressure or acids.

She and other scientists are looking for bacteria that are highly efficient in breaking down lignocellulose and freeing up the material that can be fermented into ethanol. Bacteria in giant panda digestive tracts are prime candidates.

Not only do pandas digest a diet of bamboo, but they have a short digestive tract that requires bacteria with unusually potent enzymes for breaking down lignocellulose.

Professor Brown explained: 'The time from eating to defecation is comparatively short in the panda, so their microbes have to be very efficient to get nutritional value out of the bamboo.

'And efficiency is key when it comes to biofuel production â€” that's why we focused on the microbes in the giant panda.'

Working with scientists at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, her team identified bacteria that break down lignocellulose into simple sugars, which can be fermented into bioethanol.

As well as helping to advance biofuels, Professor Brown said understanding the relationships between the microbes and the pandas is important for the endangered animals' conservation. There are plans to expand the work to include samples from red pandas (pictured) at the Memphis Zoo, which also eat bamboo

They also found bacteria that can take those sugars and transform them into oils and fats for biodiesel production.

Professor Brown said either the bacteria themselves or the enzymes in them that actually do the work could be part of the industrial process.

'These studies also help us learn more about this endangered animal's digestive system and the microbes that live in it, which is important because most of the diseases pandas get affect their guts,' she said.

'Understanding the relationships between the microbes and the pandas, as well as how they get their energy and nutrition, is extremely important from a conservation standpoint, as fewer than 2,500 giant pandas are left in the wild and only 200 are in captivity.'

Additional plans include expanding the work to include samples from red pandas at the Memphis Zoo, which also eat bamboo.
