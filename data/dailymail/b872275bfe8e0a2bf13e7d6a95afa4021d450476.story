The two youngest members of the Kardashian klan have confirmed they're following in the footsteps of Kate Moss and launching a Topshop clothing line.  

After much speculation Kendall, 19, and Kylie, 17, confirmed the deal on their website, saying: 'A collection designed by sisters Kendall and Kylie Jenner will be stocked exclusively at selected Topshop stores globally and online at TOPSHOP.COM', before tweeting the link. 

The range will comprise a  capsule summer wardrobe which, according to their website will be 'characterized by the girls’ LA lifestyle and their contemporary, eclectic design aesthetic.'

She might be a reality TV star, but at heart, Kendall is clearly a model through and through, just look at her here on the runway at Chanel, styled in the Spring Haute Couture collection.

Wearing a sheer cropped shirt and organza floral skirt, teamed with boots, Karl Lagerfeld has mixed moody florals with romantic sheer material creating a stunning look (just one of many!)

Of course with Chanel Couture, you cannot buy the look so try not to get your hopes up. But what you can do, is take inspiration from this great designer and inject the trend into your wardrobe in preparation for the spring/summer season.

Florals of course are going to be all the rage, but make your pick an A-line skirt to work Kendall's sophisticated look. Take a look at the organza skirt at Asos for an ethereal feel that's a total bargain and team with a cropped tee or shirt to nail the look in style.

Both sisters broke the news to their Twitter followers, with Kylie's tweet being liked over 3,000 times 

Kendall's tweet announcing the collaboration was retweeted over 1,000 times in under two hours

The pair, who boast nearly 18 million Twitter followers between them, will add working with the high street brand to their growing business portfolio which includes a  clothing collection, book series and the reality TV show Keeping Up With The Kardashians.

Kendall's tweet announcing the collaboration was retweeted over 1,000 times in under two hours, receiving 2,600 likes while Kylie's had received 3,800 likes. 

Topshop, who also confirmed the news through Twitter, is already being bombarded with questions about the collection from those eager to get their hands on anything endorsed by the sisters. 

Kendall and Kylie - the youngest daughters of Kris Jenner and Bruce Jenner and half-sisters of Kim Kardashian West, Kourtney and Khloe Kardashian - are believed to have been approached by the high street clothes shop because of their rocketing profiles.

Just last week, Kendall caused a stir when she took to the catwalk for Chanel at Paris Fashion Week.

Like their successful older sisters, Kendall and Kylie are already experienced businesswomen and the model is already linked with the brand as she sat front row at Topshop Unique's show last February, next to Sir Philip Green, Anna Wintour and  Kate Moss.

Kendall and Kylie's sisters Kourtney, Kim and Khloe have worked with Philip Green before when they launched a clothing range with another of his high street stores, Dorothy Perkins.  

Kendall was thrust into the limelight at the age of 14, when she appeared alongside the rest of her family on the hit TV show Keeping Up With The Kardashians. 

But it has been her lifelong dream to break away from the television programme that propelled her to fame and cement her name as a model - and now Kendall is making her fantasy a reality.

Kendall has already walked in the season's hottest fashion week shows and was recently unveiled as the face of Estée Lauder.

Then recently, Karl Lagerfeld, who is largely considered to be the fashion industry's most esteemed designer, revealed that Kendall has been chosen as the face of his SS15 campaign. 

MailOnline have contacted Topshop for a comment.  

The news comes amid the revelations of their father, Bruce Jenner's, decision to transition from male to female.

While Kim Kardashian has said that the family supports him '100 per cent', his youngest daughters have yet to issue a statement.

Olympic decathlete Bruce, 65, is rumoured to be preparing a tell-all interview with US interviewer Diane Sawyer.  

Kendall and Kylie are his youngest children and the only two he shares with his wife of 23 years Kris Jenner.
