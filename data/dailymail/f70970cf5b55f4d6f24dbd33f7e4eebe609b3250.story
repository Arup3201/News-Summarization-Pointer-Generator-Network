The modern-day woman prefers sleep and technology to sex. 

A new global study has revealed that as the world gets more complex, females are turning to simpler life choices that make their lives easier.

More than 4,300 women were questioned from the UK, Brazil, China and the US on a range of issues including sex, sleep, money, technology and family concerns. 

In the survey, 68 per cent of British women revealed they would prefer a good night's sleep to sex, compared to 60 per cent in the US and 70 per cent in China. 

A study questioned 4,300 British, American, Chinese and Brazilian women. 68 per cent of those answering in the UK revealed they would prefer a good night's sleep to sex, compared to 60 per cent in the US, 70 per cent in China and 38 per cent in Brazil 

Brazilian women were the least worried about a good night's kip, with only 38 per cent preferring sleep to making love. 

In America and Britain, sex didn't even out-perform technology - given the choice to go three months without sex or technology, the majority would prefer to go without sex.

It didn't any better in a battle against money either. 

When asked if they would prefer more money, sex or power, 80 percent prefer money. Money secures the family's future, which women prioritize over their own needs. 

On average, women in the UK, U.S. and Brazil believe that 'old age' starts at age 70, whereas in China, where old age is revered, it is seen as coming earlier – 50 for women, and 60 for men 

But money didn't necessarily mean being rich - just being financially stable: when asked to define success, women most frequently cited financial security, family and happiness, while deprioritising wealth and luxury.

The study, which was commissioned by FleishmanHillard and Hearst Magazine, also showed a huge gap between what is perceived as 'old' in the different countries.  

On average, women in the UK, U.S. and Brazil believe that 'old age' starts at age 70.

When asked to define success, women most frequently cited financial security over wealth 

That age is a moving target though -  millennials (aged between 18-29) think old age starts at 60, while baby boomers (aged between 50-69) think it starts at 80.

In China, where old age is revered, it is seen as coming earlier – 50 for women, and 60 for men. 

The attitudes in the different countries were also very different about how women felt towards consumer brands. 

While value was the key reason for ladies using a particular brand, there were many issues that would convince them to drop a product. 

In the UK and the US, the biggest deal-breaker is learning that a company discriminates against women. 

Inn China, women are most likely to discontinue brand use if the company is on the brink of bankruptcy. 

While in Brazil, a company that has been hacked and had credit card information compromised is most likely to lose customers.
