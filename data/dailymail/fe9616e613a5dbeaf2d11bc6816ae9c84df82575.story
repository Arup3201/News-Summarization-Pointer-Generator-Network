An 11-year-old Ohio girl has received a death threat stuffed in the cut throat of a beloved Raggedy Ann doll that was stolen from her house.

Bella Mastracci's doll was taken from her Powell home recently, and returned shortly after to the family's porch almost decapitated with a threatening message that read 'Dear Bella... you should kill yourself before I do,' stuffed inside.

Bella rushed to show the doll and the note to her mother, Cami Amato, who called police, spoke with neighbors, and contacted the parents of children playing in her home when the toy disappeared.

Shocked: Bella's mother, Cami Amato, pictured with her daughter, immediately called police after she saw the doll

'(I'm shocked) that people have the audacity to walk up to my front porch and drop the doll here,' Amato told NBC News 4.

'Powell parents are just like "I can't believe this is going on."'

Powell police detectives have had lab tests performed and followed leads, but so far they have failed to get to the source of the threat. The note went on to say 'P.S. My last name starts with a (sic) H.'

Deputy chief Stephen Hrytzik said they were unable to take fingerprints but will use other methods to find the culprit.

'Oh this is a crime, absolutely. It is a concern to the parents, it's a concern to us. We don't see cases like this very often.'

Bella, who is going into the sixth grade, said she was devastated and confused when she found the doll upside down on the porch.

'It was one of my favorite dolls when I was young,' she said.

She has been bullied before, her mother said. But Bella vowed to ignore the incident and urged the person responsible to leave her and others alone in future.

'Stop bullying. Don't be mean. Don't bully anybody else, because it's hurting them,' she told NBC News.
