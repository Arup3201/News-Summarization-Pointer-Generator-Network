I suffered a number of concussions in my playing career and in those days it was very much the done thing to just shake it off and carry on playing.

I lose count of the amount of times that happened. On some occasions it was actually seen as a bit of a joke, something to laugh about, when a team-mate or opponent was clearly knocked senseless and not in control of their faculties.

But I’m pleased to say that culture is changing. As we learn more about the long-term repercussions of head injuries, it’s important that sports adapt accordingly and introduce measures which keep players safe, from grassroot level up to the professional game.

No laughing matter: Head injuries used to be considered funny, but we're gradually changing that

Moving forward: Moody has agreed to donate his brain to medial science after death to speed up research

There is still a great deal to learn — and I for one have agreed to donate my brain to medical science after I die in an effort to help with that — but the key thing for me is that players, coaches, referees and parents are all educated about the symptoms and risks associated with concussion.

I was delighted to join the Mail on Sunday’s concussion campaign when I was first approached more than a year ago and I’m proud to have played a part in helping to get people talking about what is a difficult but important topic.

Putting your head where it hurts: Rugby is a great sport but safety has to come first 

There’s more to be done, but it feels as if rugby is leading the way. It’s a brilliant sport and one that I want to see more and more children playing.

But in order to do that we have to be able to look parents in the eye and say that their children will receive the best possible care if they do suffer a head knock.
