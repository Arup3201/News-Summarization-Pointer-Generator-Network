Ravel Morrison will be hoping to make a big impression at West Ham this season after an up-and-down campaign last year.

And the flying winger is certainly starting as he means to go on - judging by his new footwear he has been sporting back at West Ham's Chadwell Heath training ground.

The Hammers players reported back for the first day of pre season training on Wednesday all wearing the club's new home shirt - but it was difficult not to be distracted by the frightening design of the 21-year-old's footwear.

Morrison's new boots come in pink and blue printing in an unmissing eye-catching style - although fans will have to wait and see if they match well with the Hammers' new shirt.

The former Manchester United man is known to be a fan of bright footwear on the pitch but his new boots take it to a whole new level.

Morrison will be keen to provide a better impression than his boots this season after an up-and-down year where he managed to be one of West Ham's best players but was also farmed out to QPR on loan later in the campaign.

Pace: Morrison was brilliant for West Ham in their 3-0 win over Spurs and throughout the early season

All change: But then the winger ended up on loan at QPR in the second half of the season
