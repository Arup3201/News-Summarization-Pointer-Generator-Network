The proof that some drivers are a complete menace on the roads is all in these pictures.

And you certainly don't need to be eagle-eyed to spot them, with drivers taking to highways with over-sized packages hanging from open boots, carpets rolling from the back of vans and mattresses loosely strapped to car roofs. There's even a motorcyclist wearing a chair over his helmet.

These do-it-yourself delivery drivers are  taping down illegal fridge loads and strapping four-burner barbecues to the back of boots while making a mockery of the road rules.

Now police are fighting back, with the Highway Patrol in NSW posting photographs on their Facebook page of  law-breakers  taken by officers - or stunned members of the public - from NSW and around the world.

A high visibility singlet attached to a barbecue - on the outside of sedan - certainly isn't legal

Low visibility driving: Two chairs attached to the head of this motorcycle rider while he drives in the centre lane

Half of the driving lane through this car park is blocked due to this overhanging tree

Crazy photographs include trucks taking roundabouts and blocking lanes, ladders in the back of flat-bed utes that aren't tied down and back-seat passengers doubling up as safety restraints, holding on to beds attached to a car roof.   

The page has gone viral with more than 100,000 'fans' either send images or simply viewing the latest compilation of reckless acts.

Police have said while some of the examples are viewed as 'light-hearted fun', they can also lead to serious injury and sometimes death.

Do not overtake truck while turning: Impossible - this driver blocked a whole street when he tried to turn right, left ... who knows?

I bought a fridge!: Jeep driver tapes his fridge  down to the back of this car 

Tall order: This is a ladder, on the tray of a ute without any secure strapping whatsoever

Roll out the brown carpet! Open double doors at the back of this van allows the load to stick out the back

Inspector Mick Timms, of NSW Police, said a motorist was killed last year when a load fell from the back of a truck at Liverpool, south west of Sydney, and crushed the driver travelling behind. 

He said the images are evidence that these acts are not just happening in foreign countries with lax road laws, but back home in Australia as well.

'We get sent pictures from time to time and it just shows that these acts are not just happening in other countries but here as well,' Inspector Timms said.

Mr Timms said where there is enough evidence to investigate a tip-off, police will usually take steps to prosecute drivers. 

But in most cases - such as the booted-up barbecue - identifying drivers can sometimes be difficult.

'The barbecue driver had no number plates, and there was no date, time or place on the image.'

'It makes it hard to track down.'  

He said most of the images that filter through are of trucks and large heavy vehicles with illegally stacked or restrained loads. 

Strange bedfellows: Not one, but two mattresses stacked on one another while they stick out the back of this car's boot

Fruit packs illegally tied to the back of this ute make it impossible for this driver to see through his rear vision mirror

They're potentially deadly death traps for cars, pedestrians and passing motorcycles travelling behind or past the culprits. 

NSW Police will launch Operation Slow Down - a high-visibility traffic operation – to combat the long-weekend road toll.  

NSW Police Force Deputy Commissioner Catherine Burn said the need for vigilance was high this weekend.

'This long weekend marks the start of the busy run up to Christmas and the New Year; families returning from school holidays; as well as major sporting events across Sydney.

'We expect to see a large increase of motorists taking to the roads to enjoy these events and the warmer weather, however, this always brings an element of risk.'

It's unsure what exactly is hanging out of the back of this van but whatever it is - it's not legal

Wide load: Piping laid across the top of this ute may have created some problems for passing motorists
