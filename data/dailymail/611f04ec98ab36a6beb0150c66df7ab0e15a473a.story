This is the moment a snubbed girlfriend whose boyfriend ignored her during a stadium 'kiss-cam' appeared to get her own back by ditching him - and kissing the stranger next to her instead.

But the playful couple are thought to be playing a prank on the cameraman and the hilarious moment was all in jest.

The mystery couple were picked out by the cameraman who scanned Madison Square Garden during the New York Knicks' game against the Houston Rockets on Thursday.

Usually couples snuggle up for a quick smooch which is shown on a huge screen, but the dark-haired man appeared to refuse to look up from his mobile phone.

His pretty girlfriend, along with other sports fans, tried to grab his attention, but when he failed to look up she turned to the Knicks fan sat on her other side.

The good-looking pair enjoy a passionate clinch which eventually attracted the attention of her furious boyfriend, and was met by cheers and laughter from the New York crowd.

Fans said the apparently inattentive man spent the rest of the game in the huff, while crowd members congratulated the quick-thinking kisser nearby.

The couple at the match have not been identified but the kiss was watched by thousands, including British tourist Hugo Davies, 19, who filmed it.

Student Hugo, who was visiting family in New York, said: 'I definitely wasn't expecting it.

The woman appeared upset when her boyfriend kept on texting during the kiss-cam, but it appears to be a stunt

'I was filming because this was my first basketball match and it was a normal kiss cam until this happened.

'At first people were shouting and laughing because he was ignoring her but when she kissed the other guy everyone went crazy cheering and laughing.

'When it did happen I couldn't stop laughing at the time, like she totally embarrassed the guy.

'I think he was on his phone and wanted to finish sending his text or something so she kissed the other guy instead.

'Everyone was talking about it when they left the building, some people even went and high-fived the guy she kissed.

'I think the event happened at the end of the 3rd quarter.

'I don't think it was staged because the guy looked genuinely angry and embarrassed after, he was blushing dark red for the rest of the game and didn't talk to her afterwards', he added.

However it appears that the couple had just put on the dramatic show for the audience. 

The New York Knicks lost to the Houston Rockets 120-96.
