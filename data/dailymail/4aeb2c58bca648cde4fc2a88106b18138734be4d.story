In 2009, former Liverpool chief executive Christian Purslow sat alone in the stands to watch Raheem Sterling play for England Under 17s against Northern Ireland.

‘Just watching him play then, I knew he would go on to play for  England at the highest level,’ recalled Purslow yesterday as he spoke of the best £500,000 he ever spent, to sign Sterling from QPR.

Liverpool’s academy director Frank McParland and chief scout Eduardo Macia had been to watch him play for the youth team at Rangers. They were convinced they had found something special and Purslow agreed.

Have faith, Roy: Hodgson should select Raheem Sterling from the start against Italy

Backdrop: Raheem Sterling pings one in front of the stunning scenery surrounding England's training base

Nearly five years on, England have discovered a star before a ball has even been kicked at the World Cup in Brazil. Sterling (below) has to play on Saturday against Italy.

Those who have watched him train or play, either in Miami last week or here at the Urca military base  yesterday, walk away with the same verdict. He is special.

There is room for him at No 10 in this England team if Wayne Rooney moves out to the left and James Milner plays on the right against Italy. Danny Welbeck — reliable yet unremarkable — would be sacrificed.

Rooney, whose finishing was of the highest order in training yesterday, provides experience and Milner adds security on the right in place of Adam Lallana. Roy Hodgson has to make this happen.

Sterling, 19, is one of a dying breed — comfortable when running at defenders at high speed.

The Liverpool forward enjoys it, too. This was evident yesterday when his twinkle-toed moves took him past his team-mates on a glorious day here in Rio.

Even Lallana has been marvelling at Sterling’s ability since they joined up for the World Cup.‘He’s a great athlete and the more we see of him on the pitch the better it is for the country,’ said Lallana  yesterday.

‘It is great that he has taken his club form into the national set-up, but there are a lot of talented players in various positions.

‘Wayne played out wide the other day and Milner can play there. There is a lot of competition and that is healthy.’

It is too soon to be talking of Sterling and Ross Barkley starting in the same team at the World Cup. That can come later.

Barkley is another who wants to make things happen, but there is too much temptation to play fast and loose when he is in  possession. He will be better coming from the bench.

Sterling’s star continues to rise and he was mesmerising during the intervals in the various drill sessions being put on by Hodgson during yesterday’s open training session.

He was full of tricks, flicks and turns, with his mastery of the ball something to behold. He is a joy to watch.

The Liverpool forward has no fear and that is something England must capitalise on in tournament conditions.

There is also the obvious issue of trust, particularly when you factor in his age, lack of international  experience and his dismissal against Ecuador at the Sun Life Stadium last Wednesday.

His rash challenge on Antonio Valencia was a mistake, but he showed maturity after the Manchester United winger grabbed him by the throat during that fiery exchange. Hodgson is convinced he has learned.

Team-mates: Sterling and Daniel Sturridge provided plenty of superb moments for Liverpool this season

Sterling’s game has benefited from an extended run in the Liverpool side this season alongside the PFA player of the year Luis Suarez and his England team-mate Daniel Sturridge.

He has come a long way since the early phase of his Liverpool career, when he was one of three hugely- talented young British players signed by Purslow around the same time.

Jonjo Shelvey, who arrived from Charlton, moved on last season and signed for Swansea after failing to become a regular fixture in the Liverpool set-up.

Danny Wilson, who was a Scotland Under 17 international when he arrived from Rangers, has returned back north of the border to Hearts.

Sterling has made the grade, though, forcing his way into the first team at Liverpool and forcing Hodgson to make a decision when he travels to Manaus.

He has only made two starts for his country, but he is the man in form as the countdown continues to England’s opening group game.

On Saturday evening, Sterling can make the difference.
