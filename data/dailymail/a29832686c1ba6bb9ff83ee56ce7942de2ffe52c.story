Briton Mark Cavendish on Sunday won Belgium one-day race Kuurne-Brussels-Kuurne.

The Etixx-QuickStep rider triumphed in a sprint finish ahead of Katusha's Alexander Kristoff and Team Sky's Elia Viviani.

It was a second British win of the weekend after Ian Stannard (Team Sky) won Omloop Het Nieuwsblad on Saturday.

Cavendish had been warned earlier this week that he must regain his status as the world's top sprinter to earn a lucrative contract extension at Etixx-QuickStep.

The Manx Missile is in the final year of his three-year deal with the Belgian squad he joined after exiting Team Sky prematurely at the end of 2012, after one season.

The 25 time Tour de France stage winner is 30 in May and has seen Marcel Kittel emerge as the dominant sprinter in recent seasons but his win in Belgium will certainly help his cause if he is to stay at Etixx-QuickStep.
