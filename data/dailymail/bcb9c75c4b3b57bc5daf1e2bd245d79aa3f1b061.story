Eliot Spitzer's divorce has been approved by a Manhattan judge putting an end to his 26-year marriage to his wife Silda.

The disgraced former governor and his estranged wife did not have to appear in court at all during the process, which began three weeks ago- just days after it was revealed that he was dating his former campaign manager.

The details of the case have been kept quiet, with the couple choosing to even keep their names off the records by opting to use Anonymous v. Anonymous instead for the official filings.

Officially done: A judge has approved Silda and Eliot Spitzer's divorce after being married for 26 years

Family: The couple has three daughters together, all of whom are with in or have graduated from college

There was some speculation that a division of assets would become acrimonious, especially considering Spitzer's family wealth that including profits from his father's estimated $500million real estate fortune.

That did not end up being the case, and the couple kept true to their initial statement where they said that the split was a formality coming after having settled their issues privately.

'All issues between us have been resolved and are uncontested,' Eliot and Silda said through their family's spokeswoman, Lisa Linden.

Spitzer maintained that he and his wife were still together during his effort to re-enter politics by running to be New York City's next comptroller last summer, but Silda was never seen on the campaign trail.

Instead, he was- predictably- spotted with his campaign manager Lis Smith throughout the course of the race.

They were later photographed entering and leaving Ms Smith's apartment on a number of nights in December.

The Spitzers put out their joint statement about their 'regret' that their marriage ended.

He didn't wallow in the end of the relationship for too long, however, as he was pictured going to spend Christmas with his new girlfriend's family in the suburbs.

Spitzer was seen partying with Smith, 31, and a group of friends at a bar the night before filing the divorce papers in January.

'They seemed already drunk and ordered vodka, a margarita, and a beer tower, which is four pitchers in one container,' the spy told The New York Post.

Division of assets: Silda and Eliot lived in an apartment on Manhattan's Fifth Avenue that belonged to his father but the details of their divorce agreement have not been publicly released so it is unclear who will hold on to it
