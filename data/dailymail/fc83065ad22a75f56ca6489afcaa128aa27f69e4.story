Hull winger Robbie Brady has revealed his part in the crucial winning goal against QPR provided a sweet end to a worrying week.

Brady missed several days of training ahead of last weekend's crunch relegation clash after his one-year-old daughter Halle was taken to hospital in Dublin with a virus.

Tigers boss Steve Bruce was happy to give the Irishman the time he needed to support his family, but was also delighted when Brady declared himself ready to return to the club on Friday and face Rangers 24 hours later.

It was hardly ideal preparation - physically or emotionally - for Brady, but it was his fine cross that set up Dame N'Doye for a last-gasp winner at the KC Stadium.

'We had a little bump in the road, my daughter wasn't well and was in hospital for a few days,' he said.

'I felt I needed to be with her for a few days and I was.

'The manager phoned me to make sure everything was okay and she was picking up, so I flew back in and trained Friday to prepare for the game.

'My heart was set on playing, especially having just got back in the team recently, and thankfully everything was okay.'

Brady's issues were not widely known when he took the field last weekend, but he believes it is important that footballers are not seen as immune from problems such as his.

'We're just normal people. It's still as real for us when something like that happens,' he said.

'That's what comes first for us, just like for anyone else.

'It's not nice seeing them so small and not being able to do much about it when they're not well, but you've got to be there and be strong for them.

'She's almost back to full health. It's been a hard week but it ended well.'

Brady is set to retain his starting spot for the fourth match in a row against Stoke on Saturday, having ousted Scotland international Andy Robertson from the first XI in recent weeks.
