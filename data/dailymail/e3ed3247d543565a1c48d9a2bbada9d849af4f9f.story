This is the moment when a convoy of patrol cars were seen escorting a mobility scooter being driven along the road by a police community support officer.

The PCSO was deployed to ride the buggy under escort by two marked patrol cars to a police station in Salisbury, Wiltshire, following the arrest of a man on suspicion of theft and assault.

A passenger in a passing car filmed the scene and the footage was later posted on the internet.

The 23-second clip entitled ‘Wiltshire Police - Mobility scooter convoy Awkward’ was posted on the Live Leak website after being recorded on Saturday night.

The video shows a PCSO riding the mobility scooter along a cycle path accompanied by an escort. Both patrol cars can be seen driving at low speed with the buggy between them.

As the convoy is overtaken, laughter can be heard coming from the car containing the person filming. Wiltshire Police posted a link to the video clip on the force’s Facebook page.

'Wiltshire Police needed to move the 
mobility scooter to a safe location following the arrest of a man on 
suspicion of theft and assault,' the force said. 'This was the quickest and safest way to do this.'

The video was posted yesterday on Live Leak by a Salisbury-based user named 'MonkeyMan'.

He said in the video description: 
'Myself and a few friends were taking a drive through Salisbury 
(Wiltshire) last [Saturday] night, and came across the strangest 
thing... the title says it all.'
