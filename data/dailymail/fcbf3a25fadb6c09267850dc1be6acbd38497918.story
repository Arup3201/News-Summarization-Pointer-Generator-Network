Bereaved pet owners have been left devastated after Australian insurance provider Petplan has refused to cancel their policies following the death of their beloved animals.

Australia's second largest pet insurance provider, Petplan, which is backed by Allianz, has come under fire from one of Australia's leading consumer sites Choice.

An investigation by Choice has found that the insurance firm has been neglecting grief-stricken pet owners, by forcing them to continue paying their insurance premiums for up to 12 -months following the death of their pets.

Bereaved pet owners have been left devastated after Australian insurance provider Petplan has refused to cancel their policies following the death of their beloved animals

According to Choice Head of Media, Tim Godfrey, Petplan needs to stop 'profiting from pet owners' grief'.

'We are calling on Petplan to change its policy which puts profit ahead of common sense and compassion' he said. 

'We continue to receive complaints from distraught pet owners who have been forced to pay premiums for the remainder of their policy period, even in cases where they made a claim but their pet passed away.'

Lochan and Skye both passed away within three-months of each other. Their owners are being forced to pay their premiums until March 2015

'Your family wouldn't expect to pay your health insurance premiums if you passed away so why should pet owners be forced to pay premiums after the death of the family pet?'

Petplan's policy is currently locked tight, with the wording of their clause causing confusion for customers who claim they were never alerted to the particular section.

'In the event that you cancel the policy for whatever reason after having made a claim, no premium refunds are payable and the remaining premium for that period of Insurance must be paid.' 

Annandale residents Selvi and Ross Macleod  told Daily Mail Australia that they were 'vulnerable following the passing of their two cherished Border Collie dogs and Petplan have given them no sympathy since.

The couple owned their dog Skye since he was 6-months-old and he was 9-and-a-half when he died in October.

They were also caring for Lochan since he was 6-weeks-old and he was thirteen when he passed away in June.

Now they have been told by Petplan that they must continue paying their insurance premiums until March 2015 for both Skye and Lochan, even though neither of their deceased dogs will ever need to make another claim.

Mr Macleod revealed that the couple are paying $100-a-month in premiums to the insurance firm for both dogs and expressed his dismay at the firm's practices.

'When they both died very close to each other, we felt quite vulnerable,' he said. 

'We notified the insurance company and when we contacted them by phone they said 'according to the contract you have to keep paying until the end of the first year','

Cookie the British Bulldog was 7-years-old when she passed away in August, however her grieving owner is still paying just over $78 a month for her insurance policy

He said that Petplan refused to be flexible, informing them that their only option was to continue paying their insurance premiums until the end of their contract.

The couple were 'pretty shaken' at first but decided to contact Choice as they were 'disgusted' at their insurance provider's reaction.

Choice apparently have tried on multiple occasions to contact Petplan, but to no avail.

Selvi Macleod said the couple had decided to buy pet insurance, as both their dogs were getting older and they were advised to get some cover by their vet.

She said they did not do much research into the company and if they were to do it all over again they would definitely not pick Petplan.

'It's so underhanded,' she said. 

Cookie's owner has been informed by Petplan that she must continue paying her premiums until Cookie's policy expires at the end of December 2014. Cookie is pictured here with Ms Hooker's son Tyson

'You're already grieving for your pet and you don't know what other circumstances are happening in people's lives,'

She said it was outrageous that the same company representative was never available to speak to customers directly on the phone.

'It's all verbal, you don't get any written acknowledgement,' she said. 

'Even when you try to call, you're never speaking to the same person, it's always someone else,'

'When they're actually selling, they allocate someone to you,'

'You're basically just a number,' she said.

Monika Hooker is another disgruntled Petplan customer who has also had the heartache of dealing with the insurance company following her beloved pet dog Cookie's death. 

The British Bulldog was 7-years-old when she passed away in August, however her grieving owner is still paying just over $78 a month for her insurance policy.

Ms Hooker has been informed by Petplan that she must continue paying her premiums until Cookie's policy expires at the end of December 2014. 

Speaking to Daily Mail Australia, Ms Hooker said 'no one reads the fine print' when you take out an insurance policy and 'you expect it to be common sense'.

'With health insurance, you don’t have to keep paying,' she said.

'If you make a claim, it doesn't mean you’re stuck with them for the whole year, you can change whenever you want to,' Ms Hooker said. 

Ms Hooker has told  Petplan that she will be cancelling her remaining two dogs' policies once their contract comes to an end. 

'It's not right, they're not covering her anymore, there’ s noway they're not going to be paying money out,' she said. 

'It’s not common sense, it’s unfair.' 

Choice has launched a campaign to put pressure on Petplan to change its policy and amend clause nine from page 15 of the product disclosure statement, to read:

'In the event that you cancel the Policy for whatever reason (other than the death of your Pet) after having made a claim, no premium refunds are payable and the remaining premium for that Period of Insurance must be paid.'

The amended policy would  follows the decision earlier this year by Australia's largest pet insurer, Petsure, to end the cruel practice.

According to Choice's  Tim Godfrey, by simply adding the words 'other than the death of your Pet'  Petplan would align its product disclosure statement with  Petsure and alleviate a great deal of needless suffering among grieving pet owners.

'When it comes to pet insurance clearly not all insurers are the same so it pays to do your research before committing to a pet insurance policy,' says Mr Godfrey.

'It's also important to remember to choose your pet insurer wisely because once you have opted for a pet insurance provider, it is usually for the duration of the pet's life.'

'We have found there is little scope for switching when it comes to pet insurance policies as any conditions your pet suffered from before the start of the new policy will be excluded, leading to more costly cover,' he continued.
