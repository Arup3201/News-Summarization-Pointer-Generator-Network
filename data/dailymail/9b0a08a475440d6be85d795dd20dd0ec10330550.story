A deadly 15-foot Burmese python looking for a place to crash slithered its way to a real estate office in Florida's doorstep on Thursday and employees lined up to pose with the incredibly strong reptile.

Employees at Beau Middlebrook's Sun Realty office got quite a surprise when they saw the gargantuan snake wriggling its way closer and closer to their work space located on the Isles of Capri. 

David Beatty captured the python and held onto the snake until the FWC trapper could arrive, reportsWTSP.

Big catch: Employees at Beau Middlebrook's Sun Realty office got quite a surprise when they saw the gargantuan snake wriggling its way closer and closer to their work space located on the Isles of Capri

Not a pet: Because pythons are sometimes kept as pets, wildlife workers scanned the animal for a microchip to see if it belonged to anyone but as it turned out it came from the wild 

Eight of the employees posed for a photo with the giant Python not unknown to Florida.

'I always said living on the Isles of Capri brings you closer to nature,’ Realtor Beau Middlebrook wrote on his Facebook page following the incident.

'Here is some more evidence of that. Yesterday Capt. Bubby Hail (Florida’s Finest Fishing) was returning to the dock from a fishing charter and spotted this 14.5’ Burmese Python catching some sun on the deck behind my office. After a few minutes, it crawled under the wooden steps to my office lanai,' he continued.

Patch.com reports that The Isles of Capri Fire Department and a representative from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission were able to nab the snake.

Because pythons are sometimes kept as pets, wildlife workers scanned the animal for a microchip to see if it belonged to anyone.

'It was not tagged so then a licensed collector came out, put it in the back of his truck and drove it home.'

Careful boys!:  Pythons are not venomous but can potentially kill humans by using their body to squeeze them to death without much of a chance of them surviving 

While discovering a momentous python outside the door of one's workplace may seem like an uncommon event, it's not uncommon for wild pythons to roam around Florida.

The Patch reports that back in July a python that measured 2.5 feet less was found in a family's barbecue grill in July.

The largest Python ever captured was 18.2 feet and it was caught in the Everglades.

Middlebrook was surprised to see the snake but he isn’t scared in the slightest.

'I can’t wait to see what happens next,' he wrote.

According to  Reptileknowledge.com, Pythons are not venomous but can potentially kill humans by using their body to squeeze them to death.

Pythons are not venomous but snakes this size would be deadly to a human if it constricted it
