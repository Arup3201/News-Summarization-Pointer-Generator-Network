A Shetland pony described by the Queen as her favourite retires today after nearly two decades of military service.

Cruachan III, who stands at just 90cm tall, has led a colourful career as a military mascot after leading the Royal Regiment of Scotland at dozens of Highland games, fairs and military parades.

The 23-year-old pony, who has an unusually content temperament for the species, is a personal favourite of the Queen, who always requested that he be present at Balmoral when she visited Scotland.

Captain Dougie McDougall said Cruachan III can now look forward to a well-earned rest and the regiment is looking forward to welcoming his replacement, Cruachan IV.

He said: 'The Tattoo was his last official show so from now on he can just relax in his field.

'He comes from a long line of tradition as the first Cruachan was a mascot of the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders from 1928 to 1942, then Cruachan II was the mascot from 1950 to 1985 and finally Cruachan III served as the Argyll’s mascot from 1995 to 2009.

'He was then adopted as the Royal Regiment of Scotland’s mascot after the Argylls joined with The Royal Scots Borderers, The Royal Highland Fusiliers, The Black Watch and The Highlanders to form the Royal Regiment.

'He’s done a lot of parades in his time and he was a real favourite of the Queen.

'If she was ever on holiday and knew Cruachan was around she would make sure he was there on the day that she arrived. She loves him to bits.

'We’ve got Cruachan IV coming down soon to start heading the parades which we are looking forward to.'

Cruachan III performed at this years 63rd Tattoo which sold out for the 14th consecutive year, generating £8.4m at the box office.

The show had a Diamond Jubilee theme, with more than 1,000 pipers, drummers and other musicians performing on the esplanade of Edinburgh Castle to celebrate 60 years of the Queen’s reign.

In 2008, when the Argylls returned from a gruelling six-month deployment to Afghanistan, Cruachan III led the Homecoming Parades through Stirling, Dumbarton and Alloa and also the Freedom of Canterbury Parade through Canterbury in England.

He said: 'He is as placid as they come, one of the best natured animals I have ever looked after.

'Shetland ponies have a reputation for being moody and a bit feisty; his companion Islay gets the hump all the time.

'But Cruachan is great and now has plenty of time to relax in his field and take it easy.

'He was the centre of attention every night at the tattoo but he is getting on a bit now, it’s time to give the next pony a go and Cruachan can go at his own pace.'
