Fay Calvert treasures the memories of her son Craig's first Christmas in 2006 - the five-month-old gazing in wide-eyed wonder at the fairy lights, reaching past the presents for the scrunchy wrapping paper and laughing in deep throaty gurgles at the antics of his three-year-old brother Peter.

It was a joyful, carefree day, and Fay often gets out the photographs and videos which capture the happiness and show Craig's bright blue eyes twinkling with excitement.

Support: Dr Fiona Hampton, right, has become like family to Fay Calvert

It was to be their one and only family Christmas together.

When he was three weeks old Craig was diagnosed with cystic fibrosis, a condition where a faulty gene causes the lungs and digestive system to become clogged with mucus, making it hard to breathe.

He had been seriously ill in hospital before Christmas, but Fay had desperately wanted just one normal family day at home with her sons.

'I just fixed on the dream of him waking up in his cot on Christmas morning and showing him the lights on the tree,' she remembers.

The magic of that Christmas Day was made possible by a doctor who befriended Fay, a young, single mother from Middlesbrough. Dr Fiona Hampton never left her to fend for herself - and even broke away from her own family celebrations to ring Fay on Christmas Day to check how Craig was coping.

'Dr Hampton knew how important that one day at home was to me, and instead of simply saying he had to stay in hospital - which would, frankly, have made her own life easier - she supported me in arranging for him to come home.'

She responded immediately on Boxing Day too, when Fay, 29, was worried about Craig.

'He didn't look well, he turned grey and was struggling to breathe, and when I called Dr Hampton, she met us at the hospital to make sure he was comfortable. She wasn't even supposed to be working, but she came racing to my side.

Gone too soon: Craig died in 2007 of Cystic Fibrosis

'I did ask: "Does your family mind?" and she smiled and said "my husband's a GP and he'd do the same for his patients."'

Dr Hampton had been treating Craig since he was diagnosed shortly after his birth in July 2006. He'd been referred for tests because he struggled to feed and didn't put on weight.

He was transferred to the care of Dr Hampton, a respiratory specialist based the James Cook University Hospital in Middlesbrough.

'She kept me strong. I had to go home and tell Peter something was wrong with his baby brother, and he asked "Why can't you just kiss it better?" I felt as if my heart was breaking. But Dr Hampton made me feel like I could cope with anything. She kept saying: "We'll try this", or "We'll make sure Craig is never in pain."' The word "We" meant I never felt alone.'

After his Christmas Day at home, Craig returned to Newcastle General Hospital where he remained until the end of January.

In February, 2007, after he was hospitalised again following a series of infections and breathing problems, he became increasingly unwell and Fay was told nothing more could be done.

She says: 'I could see it myself, a strange shadow seemed to have settled on Craig's face. He'd had enough of struggling. I rang Dr Hampton and she arranged for him to be transferred by ambulance back to Middlesbrough.

'We gave him a night to recover from the transfer, and at 6am on the Saturday morning, her day off, Dr Hampton walked in,' says Fay.

'She told me that Craig wouldn't feel any pain, and after they switched the ventilator off, I cuddled him. She sat with me and kept telling me he was peaceful. When he died in the early evening, she told me softly "I'm sorry, Craig's gone,"'

'She hugged me and cried, too. She wasn't my doctor that day - she was my family.

'We bathed Craig and dressed him together, then finally, after no sleep or food for 24 hours, I had to go home to tell Peter his little brother was gone. I couldn't bear the thought of Craig being alone in a hospital mortuary and I begged Dr Hampton not to leave his side.

'She took my hands and promised she wouldn't leave him. I know she waited with Craig for over an hour before the undertaker arrived. The thought of her being by his side remains a real comfort to me.

Precious memories: Fay with baby Craig pictured in 2006

'Dr Hampton helped my son die a dignified and painless death, then helped me live with the agony of losing him.'

It is for this exceptional 24-hour devotion that Fay has nominated Dr Fiona Hampton, 57, for a Health Heroes award. But the doctor herself, who has no children and lives in Great Ayton with GP husband Chris Ankcorn, insists she is merely doing her job:

'I simply set out to treat patients the way I would want my own family to be treated. Medicine really isn't a career for anyone who wants a nine-to-five job. I am about to retire, and there are so many children and families who stick in my mind and will stay in my memory always.'

All in a day's work: The doctor said she tries to treat patients how she would want her family to be treated

But despite Dr Hampton's modest protestations that she is simply 'doing her job', other families agree that she has thrown them a lifeline, too. Nicola Simmons, 41, from Redcar, Cleveland, is mother to 15-year-old Hannah, who has been under Dr Hampton's care almost all her life. Nicola, is a single mother to Alice, 18, and Matilda, 14 weeks.

Hannah, who has a rare neurological condition which affects the optic nerve and spinal cord, first became ill when she was five months old.

'I remember Dr Hampton coming into the room, picking her up and running into another ward to ventilate her. Then, she gave me a hug and told me exactly what was happening in a calm, reassuring way. From that moment on, she has given us constant care and attention which has gone way beyond anything I've ever known from any other doctor.

'In 2006, Hannah lost her sight and became completely paralysed as a result of the condition. She's also needed ventilation on and off throughout her life, and Dr Hampton just sits on her bed and chats to her, and comes to Hannah's birthday parties at our house.

'Hannah can't travel abroad, but whenever Dr Hampton has been on holiday she comes racing in and says: "Guess what Han, I saw penguins..." Hannah just adores her, and the stories become her stories to tell. She'll say: "Guess what Mum, Fiona saw the penguins."

"When I heard Dr Hampton is retiring, I actually burst into tears. There's been so many hugs, so many late-night phone calls, so much support over the years.'

Fay will also miss the doctor, who kept in contact with her family after baby Craig died.

'When I had my youngest son, Archie, four years later, I was terrified he also had cystic fibrosis, even though blood tests said he was free of the genetic condition.

'I rang her in a terrible state and she arranged to see Archie and ran a series of tests to put my mind at ease. It was only when she reassured me he was all right that I was finally able to relax and enjoy being a mum again.

'I have such happy memories of Craig. The fact that I do, and that I've coped with such loss is down to Dr Hampton. She tried to save him - and she managed to save me.'
