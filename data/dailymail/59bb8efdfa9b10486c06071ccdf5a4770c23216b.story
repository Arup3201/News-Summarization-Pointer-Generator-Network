The mother of a 12-year-old girl from Wisconsin, who collapsed and died hours after having the HPV vaccination, is questioning whether the jab may have been to blame.

Rebecca Prohaska is so desperate for answers as to why her fit and healthy daughter, Meredith, died that she agreed for medical examiners to take the girl's brain away for testing.

Meredith, who loved to play basketball, was given the routine vaccine offered to all children of her age just hours before she died.

Distraught: Rebecca Prohaska is desperate for answers as to why her daughter died, but results from toxicology tests could take months

When she returned home from the doctor's appointment, the 12-year-old complained of feeling sleepy, and napped for much of the day.

Human papillomavirus (HPV) is a common sexually transmitted infection in the U.S.

Although in many cases the virus goes away by itself, and may cause no symptoms, it can cause genital warts or cervical cancer.

Two vaccines have been introduced in the U.S. to be given to schoolchildren aged 11 to 12.

The vaccine is given at a young age because it offers the best protection before a person has become sexually active.

The vaccine in not compulsory in every state, though Wisconsin, where Meredith was from, is one of several that has legislation that requires having the vaccine, or educating families about its benefits.

But when Mrs Prohaska returned home from picking up dinner at about 4pm, she found her daughter face down on the living room floor.

She had vomited, her lips were purple, and she wasn't breathing. Meredith was rushed to hospital, where she was pronounced dead.

Doctors have so far been unable to give a reason for why the seemingly healthy schoolgirl died.

'It was the hardest thing when they called and said they don’t know. There was no reason. She was the healthiest 12-year-old,' Mrs Prohaska told the Journal-Sentinel.

Both she and her husband, Mark, suspect the HPV vaccine may have played a role because it was the only thing different on the day Meredith died.

“It has to be that vaccine,” Mark Prohaska told Fox6. 'I’m a tough guy. I can take a beating - but this has ripped a hole in my heart.'

The couple are waiting for the results of several tests for possible toxins or disease-causing microorganisms, but it could take months before they have the answers they so desperately need.

Although they suspect the vaccine may have played a part in their daughter's death, Dr Geoffrey Swain told Fox6 that severe side effects were rare and that the HPV jab had few risks.

'Vaccines in general and the HPV vaccine in particular, very, very safe. It’s a very safe vaccine and very effective,' he said.
