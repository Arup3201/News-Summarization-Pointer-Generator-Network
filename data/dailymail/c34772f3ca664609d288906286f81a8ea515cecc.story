British funding for green projects overseas is going to major economies such as India, Brazil and South Africa, a report reveals.

The world’s poorest countries are being ‘left behind’ as richer nations scoop up most of the cash, according to the Overseas Development Institute.

The British think tank calculated that booming economies have received the lion’s share of climate finance from Western nations – including at least £1.6billion from the UK – over the past decade. 

Ed Davey, the Liberal Democrat Energy Secretary, insists that the UK must fund green projects abroad because the world’s poorest nations are the ones set to be hit the hardest by global warming

The money has funded wind farms, solar panels, flood defences and forestry schemes.

Ed Davey, the Liberal Democrat Energy Secretary, insists that the UK must fund green projects abroad because the world’s poorest nations are set to be hit the hardest by global warming.

However, the new analysis reveals that the ten most vulnerable nations benefited from only seven per cent of climate aid. 

The Overseas Development Institute released its report at the United Nations climate change summit in Peru. 

The money has funded wind farms, solar panels, flood defences and forestry schemes in many countries

Funding for poor countries to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and adapt to global warming is a key part of the negotiations, with the UN trying to raise £64billion a year from 2020 onwards.

The report analysed a decade of loans and grants going into international funds set up to tackle climate change. 

Of the £4.8 billion that the ODI looked at, the UK was the biggest contributor, putting in £1.6billion. 

Half the money went to just ten countries, each of them major economies. The remaining half was divided between 125 nations.

Smita Nakhooda, lead author of the report, called for money to be directed to the areas where it is most needed.

‘The lives of millions of people in poor countries affected by climate change depend on getting this right,’ she said.

Conservative MP Peter Bone (pictured) called for a fundamental rethink of Britain’s green aid scheme

‘The UK contributions to multi-lateral funds are pooled with other sources of finance and contributions from other countries, and so one cannot distinguish the UK contributions from those of others.

‘But the UK does have significant influence in decision-making over how the funds allocate their resources, alongside other countries.’

However, even one of the world’s poorest countries admitted that the UN is asking too much of western nations by insisting on huge financial contributions for green projects.

Bangladesh’s environment minister Anwar Hossain Manju told reporters in Lima: ‘We are probably expecting too much from the industrialised and developed countries, because today all countries are suffering from social, political, economic problems.’

Conservative MP Peter Bone called for a fundamental rethink of Britain’s green aid programme.

‘My constituents expect overseas aid to go where it is really needed,’ he said. ‘It is completely bonkers that we are giving money to major economies to fund climate change projects.’

The UK is committed to spending £3.9billion for green projects abroad between 2011 and 2016. 

That sum is likely to rise in the coming years.

Schemes funded with UK cash in recent years include £25million to restore forest and low-carbon agriculture in Brazil and £6million for solar panels in India – a nation prosperous enough to have its own £328million-a-year overseas aid programme.

A spokesman for the Department of Energy and Climate Change said last night: ‘It is right we work with the international community to provide targeted support to countries where we know emissions are predicted to grow rapidly. 

'This will help stop climate change and reduce its impact on the poorest and most vulnerable.’
