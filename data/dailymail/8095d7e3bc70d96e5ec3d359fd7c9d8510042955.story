The five-year-old girl who died after she was hit by a slow-moving vehicle at a vintage steam rally and fair has been named as Tayla Saunders.

The youngster from Honiton, Devon, had been 'darting' towards a helter-skelter ride at the Lanlivery Vintage Rally in Cornwall, when she was struck by a heavy truck as it reversed in the field.

She was treated less than a minute after the accident at 11.40am on Saturday as paramedics had a display stand just 100 metres away.

Tragic scene: The vintage steam rally in Cornwall where a five-year-old died after being run over.

They made frantic efforts to resuscitate the girl who had been enjoying the day with her foster parents at the annual event near Lostwithiel.

She was taken by air to Derriford Hospital in Plymouth where she died a short time later.

A witness working in the catering area at the show was just yards away when she saw the girl running towards fairground attractions.

The woman, who did not wish to be named, said: 'We heard a little girl scream. It was a truck that was reversing very, very slowly.

'The little girl came round the 
entrance to the field and appeared to be running towards the fairground 
attractions - there was a helter skelter just 100 yards away.

'She came around the corner of the adjacent field and the truck collided with her. It was a tragic accident.'

Diane Williams, secretary of the 
show, said: 'Words can’t explain how we feel. It’s just devastating, all
of it. It was just a freak accident.

'We have everything in place for safety. The driver was doing everything correctly.'

Emergency service: Paramedics talk to visitors at the vintage steam rally after the accident

The family from Honiton, Devon, who had been running a stall at the event agreed to the event continuing on Sunday as it was raising funds for the Cornwall Air Ambulance and Fleet, a charity which supplies emergency equipment.

A special service in the girl’s memory has been led by local vicar Philip James Conway.

He said: 'The family have been most gracious.

'They have been hit by the most dreadful tragedy.

'Their attitude to all those involved in this tragedy is one that is to be utterly commended.'

Patricia Barrett, wife of show chairman Ivan Barrett, was at the show ground on Saturday. 'It was an accident.

'Nothing could have been done any differently to stop it,' she said.

'It’s one of those things that you don’t ever expect to happen. It was tragic for everyone concerned. They were all absolutely devastated.'

A spokesman for Devon and Cornwall Police said there would a full investigation into the incident.

He
added: 'The child was with her foster parents who live in Devon, her 
details are not being released at this time until interested parties are
all aware.'

A message posted on the rally's Facebook page hours after the horror incident read: 'A tragic accident occurred today.

Warning: A sign at the main entrance alerts visitors to the danger of vehicles moving around the showgrounds

'The family involved have expressed a 
wish that the rally should continue today and tomorrow,. particularly as
it is raising money for the Air Ambulance which came to help.

'The
family and the rally organisers request that this incident is not 
talked about on Facebook as it is very upsetting for the family at this 
sensitive time.

'Great sympathy goes out to the family from the organisers and the people of Lanlivery.'

The show is held on the second weekend of September each year and raises money for local charities.

For over 25 years the rally has hosted a variety of country events including a large entry of vintage machinery and cars, rollers and traction engines.

The attractions include beer tents, 
ploughing, archery, clay pigeon shooting and the fairground.

Mrs Williams revealed the driver of the vehicle involved had checked no one was behind before he moved backwards.

She said: 'He is a very safety conscious driver and he saw there was nothing there behind him. But the little girl darted out and ran into the back of the truck.'

The county's Health and Safety Executive has been informed of the girl's death.

Police based at Bodmin serious 
collisions investigation unit are appealing for witnesses to this 
incident to contact them on 101 quoting log number 396 of 08/09/2012.
