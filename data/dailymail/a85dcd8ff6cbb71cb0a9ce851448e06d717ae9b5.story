Record numbers of people are abandoning their living room TV set to watch shows on their phone, tablet and laptop.

As researchers say a third of viewers now prefer gadgets to their TV, the BBC revealed record viewing figures for its iPlayer on demand service.

It said over 2.32 billion TV and radio programme requests were made, and 36.5 billion minutes of BBC programmes were watched or listened to on iPlayer in 2012.

The 2012 Olympic Opening Ceremony was the most popular show on iPlayer, viewed 3,326,903 times

Audiences spent 34 per cent more time watching TV in iPlayer than ever before, the figures released today show.

Danny Boyle’s spectacular Olympic Opening Ceremony topped iPlayer 
viewing in 2012 with more than 3.3 million requests, followed by Top 
Gear with 2.8 million and Sherlock (2.5 million).

BBC bosses said the biggest trend in 2012 was the huge growth in iPlayer requests from mobiles and tablets which almost trebled.

By
 the end of 2012, the BBC saw a 177 per cent increase year-on-year of 
requests from mobiles and tablets - making up more than a quarter of 
total iPlayer requests.

The
 were almost 14 million downloads of the iPlayer mobile app, with 
300,000 downloads on Christmas Day to devices such as the Nexus 7, iPad 
and Kindle Fire HD.

A total of
 10.8 million BBC TV programmes were downloaded to iPhone, iPad and iPod
 Touch devices, following the launch of mobile downloads in September.

Now downloaded programmes already make up six per cent of TV viewing on 
mobiles and tablets.

Other 
2012 trends showed that for the first time in the iPlayer’s history, 
requests from personal computers (PCs) comprised less than half of all 
total iPlayer requests (47 per cent) in December 2012 alone.

2013 has already had a strong 
start, with the most requests or TV programmes ever seen in 24 hours - 
6.73 million - requested on New Year’s Day.

Daniel Danker, the BBC’s general 
manager of programmes and on-demand, said: “2012 was a ground-breaking 
year for BBC iPlayer with a record 2.32 billion requests for programmes 
across over 650 platforms.

'Last year, the use of iPlayer shifted from PCs and early adopter devices like game consoles to screens used by all audiences.

'Mobile, tablet, and connected TV skyrocketed, with a particular emphasis on audiences taking iPlayer on the go.

Top Gear was the second most watched show on iPlayer, watched 2,834,190 times

'This year, we’re looking forward to 
turning iPlayer into an entertainment destination, with a relentless 
focus on making iPlayer as easy and enjoyable as television.'

A separate study of UK viewing habits, by broadbandchoices.co.uk, revealed a third of the 2,000 people polled (33 per cent) would rather watch programmes on a tablet, smart-phone or laptop than on a traditional television set.

Researchers also found more than a third of adults watch catch-up TV online, while a quarter watched less TV on a standard set in 2012 than in 2002.

And experts predict that within five years the ordinary television set will be replaced as the primary viewing device in most British homes thanks to the rise of 'on demand' TV.

The survey also revealed more than one in four of those polled (26 per cent) watch less TV through a standard telly than they did 10 years ago.

Recent Ofcom statistics highlight that traditional television viewing among 25 to 34-year-olds fell from an average of 3.5 hours to 3.3 hours per day from 2005 to 2011.

On-demand availability has been a major factor in the shift away from traditional telly habits, with an increasing number of viewers choosing to catch up online and not be dictated to by a rigid TV schedule.

More than a third of UK adults with home internet (37 per cent) now watch online catch-up TV - a leap of 14 per cent compared with just three years ago, while one in five adults says they now watch catch-up TV at least once a week.

The survey found that Brits are actually watching an average of 90 minutes extra video, film and television content a day than they were 10 years ago - more than 500 hours a year.

Dominic Baliszewski, telecoms expert at broadbandchoices.co.uk, said: 'It’s not surprising that the old-fashioned television is losing its crown as king of the living room.

'With so many different ways for people to view films and programmes over a broadband connection, modern devices such as tablets allow viewers far more flexibility to choose where and when they watch their favourite shows.

'We could see the ordinary TV set replaced in most homes as the primary viewing device in less than five years.

'The ability to stream and download content has changed the landscape of home entertainment and put the end viewer in charge of their entertainment schedule.

The new figures also reveal how old iPlayer viewers are - and a near 50/50 split of the sexes
