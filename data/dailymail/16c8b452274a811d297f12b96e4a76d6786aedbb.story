A Coronation Street loving murderer has caused outrage after wardens allowed him to paint a life-size mural of the Rovers Return on a prison wall.

Kiaran Stapleton, 23, is serving at least 30 years for the unprovoked attack which killed Anuj Bidve in Boxing Day 2011.

The engineering student was on his way to queue up for the start of the post-Christmas sales when Stapleton senselessly shot him in the head.

Throughout his trial, Stapleton showed no remorse, telling the judge: ‘I’m not bothered. I love prison.

‘Lock me up for 55 years. Does this face look bothered?’

Police believe he had his teardrop tattoo done to show off to other criminals  that he had killed someone.

He was initially sent to Full Sutton prison near York but was transferred to Strangeways in Manchester after he attacked a priest.

As part of his rehabilitation at Category A Strangeways, he was given art lessons and the chance to help re-decorate the walls of the special intervention unit where he was housed.

Stapleton took the opportunity to pay homage to his favourite soap opera with a 10ft high painting of the ITV show's pub.

The artwork took him two weeks to complete and now marks the outer wall of the building which houses six of the prison’s most dangerous inmates.

But the project has been met with dismay from MPs who branded his treatment a disgrace.

Labour MP Keith Vaz last night told The Sun: ‘Those close to Anuj Bidve will be distraught that the thug that killed him is seemingly enjoying his time behind bars.

Tory MP David Davis added: ‘Most people agree he should never be let out of prison and he shouldn’t be given leeway to pursue his hobbies whilst in there.’

But penal reform campaigners defended Strangeways.

Andrew Neilson, of the Howard League, said: ‘Arts play an important part in helping people change their lives.

‘If this project is making him less likely to reoffend then it needs to be welcomed.

‘There is anecdotal evidence that art is a therapy which makes people think about what they have done and for that very reason the prison should be applauded.’

The special unit at Strangeways was home to Stapleton and other notorious criminals including police killer Dale Cregan. Both are now living on a general wing.

Last night the Ministry of Justice said it did not comment on individual offenders.
