A bride-to-be whose husband died unexpectedly just 52 days before their wedding let go of her pain by jumping into the Riviera Maya in Mexico wearing her wedding dress.

Janine initially had a difficult time parting with the wedding dress she bought for her nuptials with Johnny, the ultimate love of her life.

As time went by, Janine realized that her beautiful handmade wedding dress was no longer a symbol of happiness but instead was a painful reminder of what she had lost, writes Del Sol Photography.

Held on: At first, Janine couldn't let go of the beautiful handmade wedding dress she was meant to wear on her wedding day to Johnny who died unexpectedly just 52 days before the wedding

Letting go: Janine jumped into the Riviera Maya in Mexico to celebrate her love for her deceased husband Johnny but also to cleanse and heal herself of her pain so that she may start her life anew

Setting herself free: Janine couldn't part with her wedding dress at first and instead of selling it she decided to wear it as she jumped into the water as a way of setting herself free from sadness

He would have wanted it this way: Janine believes her love Johnny was smiling down on her during the photo shoot and that he would have wanted her to live freely and absorb all that life has to offer 

Janine teamed up Del Sol Photographer Matt Addock to create an enchanting 'trash the dress' photo shoot unlike any other.

'I did something never thought I would do in my whole life. I took my wedding dress that was built from scratch and I jumped into the river,' Janine said.

'I did it because I wanted to free myself from losing my fiancé ...this dress was for him. I did this because John would want me to something like this. He was so outgoing and he wanted me to have the best life,' she added.

Janine believes that her husband would have wanted her to be free to meet new people and have new experiences and wouldn't want her to live a life of suffering.

'I really felt that Johnny was smiling down at me and finally giving me closure that I can live my life in a positive way, but never forgetting why I was here. I want to move on and explore the world. I want to meet people who I can share that with. After the shoot I felt like all this was possible.'

The bittersweet images show Janine looking like a beautiful sea nymph beneath The Riviera Maya, a body of water thought to have healing properties.

After doing the photo shoot Janine said she felt refreshed and ready to move on with her life.

She had a message for anyone else who felt as though they'd suffered a loss.

'If I could reach out to anyone suffering from a loss, I would tell them this. Listen to YOUR heart! You are the most important person and only YOU can help yourself,' she said.

Bittersweet: Janine is heartbroken after her husband's death but jumping in the water in her wedding dress is a way for her to feel reborn so that she may meet new people and have new experiences

Wedding for one: Janine has a message for all others who may be mourning a loved one and its that it's just as important to love yourself as it is to love another person 

Doesn't take life too seriously: Janine is a natural firecracker who won't let losing someone she loves hang as a burden over her head for the rest of her life as it is not what Johnny would have wanted for her 

Love goes on: Janine will always remember her love Johnny but she won't let sadness stop her from experiencing the beauty of the world and the excitement of meeting new people
