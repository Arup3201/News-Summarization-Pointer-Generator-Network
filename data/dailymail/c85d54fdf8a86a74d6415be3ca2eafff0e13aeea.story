Positive signs: Nelson Mandela is 'showing great improvement', according to his ex-wife

Nelson Mandela is showing a 'great improvement' in his health from a few days ago, his ex-wife said today.

Winnie Madikizela-Mandela gave the update on the former South African president while speaking to media outside Mandela's former home in Soweto.

'I'm not a doctor, but I can say that from what he was a few days ago there is great improvement,  but clinically he is still unwell,' said Madikizela-Mandela, who is also a member of South Africa's Parliament.

Members of Mandela's family and South African Cabinet ministers have visited the hospital where the 94-year-old is critically ill.

It comes after his daughter said yesterday that he was responding to touch and trying to open his eyes, adding: 'He's still there.'

Makaziwe said that when she went to see him in hospital he was still responsive and conscious.

'I won't lie, it doesn't look good,' she told SABC.

'But if we speak to him, he responds and tries to open his eyes. He's still there. He might be waning off, but he's still there.'

Mr Mandela's granddaughter Ndileka said he was 'stable' and thanked the well-wishers from around the world who have sent their support.

The whole family had been summoned to his bedside yesterday and president Jacob Zuma was believed to have been seen entering the hospital.

'I cancelled my visit to Mozambique today so that I can see him and confer with the doctors,' Mr Zuma said in a statement. 'He is much better today than he was when I saw him last night.'

In the Eastern Cape 
province, where Mr Mandela grew up, a traditional leader said that the time was 
near for the former leader, who is also known by his clan name, Madiba.

'I am of the view that if Madiba is 
no longer enjoying life, and is on life support systems, and is not 
appreciating what is happening around him, I think the good Lord should 
take the decision to put him out of his suffering,' said the tribal 
chief, Phathekile Holomisa.

'I did speak to two of his family 
members, and of course, they are in a lot of pain, and wish that a 
miracle might happen, that he recovers again, and he becomes his old 
self again,' he said.

'But at the same time they are aware there is a limit to what miracles you can have.'

Presidential spokesman Mac Maharaj 
told the state broadcaster: 'Over the past 48 hours, the condition of 
former president Madiba has gone down.'

A South African newspaper has also reported the icon is on life support, citing numerous sources close to the family.

The Citizen newspaper says Mr Mandela has a team of doctors supporting him at a Pretoria hospital.

One source was quoted as saying that his family had the option to switch off the ventilator.Â

Mr
 Zuma cancelled a trip to neighbouring Mozambique, intensifying 
speculation about the deterioration of Mr Mandela's condition.

The
 president made his decision not to leave the country after visiting the
 94-year-old late yesterday in the Pretoria hospital where he has been 
receiving treatment for a lung infection for nearly three weeks.

'Clearly
 the issue of seriousness has been such that President Jacob Zuma has 
cancelled his trip,' Mr Maharaj told Talk Radio 702.

He declined to comment on reports that Mandela was on life support, saying: 'I cannot confirm any clinical details.'

CNN also reported that the former president could no longer breathe unaided, quoting an official who 'had been briefed in detail on his condition'.

George Bizos, one of Mr Mandela's closest friends and his former lawyer, told The Daily Telegraph that they had never discussed his wishes towards the end of his life.

'We
 can only hope for the best, and that is what the doctors decide to do,'
 he said. 'I am sure that the members of the family are discussing the 
matter with the doctors but it should probably be primarily the doctors 
in consultation with the family if the situation is critical.'

Last night a leading clergyman visited Nelson Mandela's bedside to offer prayers for his 'peaceful, perfect end'.

Thabo Makgoba, the Archbishop of Cape
 Town, issued an emotional statement asking that the former president of
 South Africa, who is in a critical condition, be released from pain and
 suffering.

However, Mr Mandela apparently opened
 his eyes and smiled when he was told about Barack Obama's forthcoming 
visit to the country, according to his daughter.

The statesman was able to 
show his pleasure at hearing of the U.S. President's visit.

Mr
 Obama is believed to be keen to meet Mr Mandela, but given the delicate
 condition of the African leader he will not do so unless he is invited 
by the Mandela family.

That prospect appeared to be more 
likely after Mr Mandela's daughter Zindzi described how she 
told her father that Mr Obama would be touring South Africa.

After she told him 'Obama is coming,' she said, 'He opened his eyes and gave me a smile.'

The
 U.S. President arrived in Senegal yesterday and travelled to South 
Africa today during his second trip to Africa since taking office.

Speaking in Dakar, Mr Obama paid tribute to Mr Mandela and insisted his visit to South Africa would go ahead matter what.

He said that the anti-apartheid campaigner had helped inspire him to enter politics with his bravery and self-sacrifice.

'I think he's a hero for the world,' Mr Obama said. 'And if and when he passes from this place, one thing I think we'll all know is that his legacy is one that will linger on throughout the ages.'

Mr
 Mandela has been in hospital being treated for a lung infection since 
June 8.

Mr Mandela, who became South Africa's
 first black president after the end of apartheid in 1994, was 
hospitalised for a recurring lung infection. This is his fourth 
hospitalisation since December.

Mandela
 was jailed for 27 years under white racist rule and was released 23 
years ago, in 1990. He then played a leading role in steering the 
divided country from the apartheid era to an all-race democracy.

As a result of his sacrifice and peacemaking efforts, he is seen by many around the world as a symbol of reconciliation.
