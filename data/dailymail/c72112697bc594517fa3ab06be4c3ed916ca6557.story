Eugenie Bouchard survived another scrap to beat Barbora Zahlavova Strycova 6-2, 6-7 (2-7) 6-4 in the third round of the US Open.

In her first night session match against Sorana Cirstea two days ago, seventh seed Bouchard was pushed all the way and it was no different this time.

There is no doubting the mental toughness of the 20-year-old Canadian, though, and she showed it once again despite looking in big trouble in the third set.

Zahlavova Strycova led 30-0 on her serve at 4-4 having just broken Bouchard but she tightened up and paid for it dearly.

Bouchard, who next plays 17th seed Ekaterina Makarova, said: 'I feel like I pulled myself together at the very, very end tonight.

'She got a lot of balls back. She made me work for it. At the same time she would occasionally come to the net, mix things up.

'It was the kind of variety I haven't seen much of. Generally most opponents don't do that so it was a little different.

'But I'm just proud at least that I could battle. Even if it's a little bit ugly or I don't feel great, I can still pull it out, which made me happy.'
