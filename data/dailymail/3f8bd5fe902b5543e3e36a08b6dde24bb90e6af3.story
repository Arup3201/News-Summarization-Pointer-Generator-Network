A Michigan woman whose boyfriend started a massive fire on her deck while attempting to cook a squirrel using a blowtorch is being sued for more than $2 million by her building's insurance companies.

Traveler's Indemnity Company, which insured the Clearview apartment building at 120th Ave and Riley St in Holland County, claims Barbara Pellow signed a lease in which she agreed to be responsible for any damages caused to the building by herself or her boyfriend, Khek Chanthalavong.

The company paid out more than $2 million to repair damages caused to apartments in the building as a result of the fire, which left 32 apartments uninhabitable.

Destroyed: The blaze quickly spread to the rest of the apartment building and made 32 people homeless

Easy way out: The man was preparing to eat the squirrel and perhaps thought he could burn the hair off instead of skinning it

Another insurance company, Auto Owners Insurance Company, insured three apartments in the building and paid $56,529.52 in damages, reports M Live.

The company has also filed a suit against both Pellow and Chanthalavong, claiming they had 'a duty to act with reasonable care on the apartment premises.'

In October 2012, Chanthalavong used a propane torch to singe the fur off a squirrel he captured while on the third-floor deck of Pellow's apartment.

Blow torches can reach temperatures in excess of 2,500 degrees - hot enough to melt copper.

Chanthalavong was preparing to eat the squirrel and perhaps thought he could burn its fur off instead of skinning it - a notoriously tough task requiring special technique.

According to investigators, Chanthalong placed the torch in the the corner of the deck and went inside to cook the squirrel.

MLive reports that Pellow awoke around 12:30pm  to Chanthalavong yelling and attempting to douse flames with water, but the blaze spread quickly. Eight apartments were destroyed and a further 24 were badly damaged, leaving residents homeless.

The blaze was so fierce that firefighters had to call in backup from the nearby town of Zeeland.

The
 fire started about 12.30pm and several residents reported having to run
 for their lives as flames and thick, black smoke spread to their 
apartments.

'You think you know what you'll grab, but you really don't,' resident Jack Pruim said.

Pruim said he only had time to rescue his dogs before fleeing.

'Pellow is contractually obligated to Travelers for the full amount of any and all damages from the fire and water damage including the actual costs of repairing or replacing the damaged property as well as any loss of rental income suffered by Clearview related to the fire and water damage,' a complaint filed in Ottawa County by the Traveler's Indemnity Company reads.

Both cases are currently in the beginning stages; Pellow is expected to appear in court to answer the Traveler's Indemnity Company case this fall.
