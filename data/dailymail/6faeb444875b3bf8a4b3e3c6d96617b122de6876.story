Megyn Kelly has sparked a new round of backlash after defending her on-air comments about Santa's 'verifiably' white skin - though she did admit her assertion that Jesus was also Caucasian is 'far from settled.'

Kelly, 43, took a sick day Thursday but returned last night in full force to hit back at her critics who ridiculed her for declaring that 'Santa is white,' and that Jesus was also a white man on her Fox Network show.

The comments came during a debate about a Slate article written by Aisha Harris who suggested a more inclusive festive icon - she proposed a penguin - become a new symbol of Christmas cheer for children.

Responding: Kelly dedicated much of her show to defending Wednesday's much derided segment about the color of Santa's skin

Kelly devoted a significant portion of Friday's The Kelly File to defending herself and her comments, saying that the real debate - whether a more inclusive Santa should be created - was lost due to the storm of controversy.

She claimed that the segment was intended as a lighthearted, tongue-in-cheek discussion but that the humor was lost on some of her detractors. 

'Humor is part of what we try to bring to the show. Sometimes that's lost on the humorless.'

Kelly's aggressive stance only added fuel to the fire Saturday.

Journalist David Badash penned a column for his news and opinion site The New Civil Rights Movement, attacking Kelly's comment about Jesus' race not being a settled matter.

‘Actually, it really is settled. But just like climate change, even if perhaps one per cent of the world’s population disagrees, a settled fact is “far from settled” at Fox News,’ he wrote.

The founder of the online journal also took issue with the anchor's claim that her assertions were tongue-in-cheek.

'Perhaps all of Fox News is really just a joke?' he wrote in his Saturday column.

Letter to Santa: MSNBC host Melissa Harris-Perry read her open letter to St Nick on her show, saying that it is an indication of how broad America's race and class divide is that some cannot envision him as anything but white

Meanwhile, MSNBC host Melissa Harris-Perry spent a portion of her program Saturday addressing the Santa-gate.

In an open letter to Kris Kringle himself, Harris-Perry said that it is an indication of how broad America’s race and class divide is that some cannot envision St Nick being anything but white, Mediaite reported. 

‘I know it’s a busy time of year, but we need to settle a little debate that’s emerged in American media asking, “Are you white? Are you black? When you come in from the North Pole, do you have a legal visa or are you undocumented?”’ Harris-Perry asked.

‘Can you find a kid if he lives in an apartment building not a house without a chimney? Can you find her in a homeless shelter?’ She continued. ‘Why do you leave so many more trees under the big trees in the wealthy neighborhood and so few under the trees in the poor communities?’

The TV presenter said that in her mixed race family, it was important to share with children depictions of role models and inspirational figures who remind them of themselves.

‘If we cannot imagine you as racially different from ourselves, it’s because our minds are stunted by a history that still can’t fathom benevolence, and kindness, and intimacy in the bodies of those who are not like us,’ Harris-Perry said. ‘If we still doubt that you can embody every possibility of racial being, it is because we do not yet believe that every racial body is capable of making our sugar plum dreams come true.’

The anchor concluded by saying that if Americans cannot even imagine Santa outside a racial context, it should not surprise anyone that a racial divide still exists in the U.S. 

On Wednesday, Kelly said on the show that just because Santa's supposed white race makes some people, including Slate columnist Aisha Harris, uncomfortable, it does not mean that it has to change.

Controversy: Kelly made her divisive comments on her show on Wednesday during a discussion with a panel of speakers

'Jesus was a white man, too. It's like
 we have, he's a historical figure that's a verifiable fact, as is 
Santa, I just want kids to know that. How do you revise it in the middle
 of the legacy in the story and change Santa from white to black?'

In fact, what Harris' article suggested was neither a black nor a white Santa, but a black-and-white bird - a festive penguin.

To that suggestion, Kelly said Harris had 'gone off the rails.'

When
 another panelist suggests this would make all kids feel equally 
welcome, she replied, 'No. No, it doesn't... It makes all birds feel 
welcome.'

Kelly said tonight that the reaction to the segment on her show would be funny if 'it were not so telling about our society, in particular the knee-jerk instinct by so many to race-bait - and to assume the worst in people. Especially people employed by the very powerful Fox News channel.'

She said that all she did was acknowledge that Santa is generally depicted as white - exactly as Harris did - and was unfairly accused of 'racial fear and loathing.'

Kelly also played several clips of other networks discussing her segment - she has been lampooned by the likes of Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert.

Historical figure: Contrary to Kelly's statements, Saint Nicholas was from modern Turkey and wouldn't have born much resemblance to rosy-cheeked Santa Claus

'The fact that an off-hand jest I made
 during a segment about whether Santa should be replaced by a penguin 
has now become a national firestorm says two things,' Kelly said. 'Race 
is still an incredibly volatile issue in this country, and Fox News, and
 yours truly, are big targets for many people.'

The comments Kelly made about Santa weren't the only ones to be met with ridicule.

'I
 also did say Jesus was white. As I've learned in the past two days, 
that is far from settled,' was all Kelly said about her statements 
pertaining to Jesus' skin color.

Classic Santa Claus: As a fictitious representation of a European Saint Nicholas - it is fair to assume that Santa Claus was white

The controversy was addressed by Reza Aslan, a scholar of religions and author of the recent bestseller Zealot: The Life and Times of Jesus of Nazareth.

An expert, Aslan said that 'as a Galilean, he would have been what is referred to as a Palestinian Jew. He would look the way that the average Palestinian would look today. So that would mean dark features, hairy, probably a longer nose, black hair,' said Aslan to the Washington Post.

Jamelle Bouie writing in the Daily Beast was even harder on Kelly.

'Kelly’s not wrong to say that Santa Claus is European - that’s his heritage.

'But there’s little chance that Jesus is white, and asserting otherwise is just as ludicrous as the declaration - made by some Christians - that Jesus spoke the early modern English of the King James Bible.

'At best, the assertion of Jesus’s whiteness reflects ignorance. At worst, it’s a sign of racial prejudice.'
