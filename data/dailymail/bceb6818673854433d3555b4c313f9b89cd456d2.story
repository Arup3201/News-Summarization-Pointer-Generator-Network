When walking along a beach, most pebbles look relatively alike - and dull - but an Italian geologist has revealed their hidden beauty using a powerful microscope.

His images, which show multi-coloured shards in the brightest colours of the rainbow could lead you to imagine that you're looking through a kaleidoscope rather than the inside of everyday stones.

Professor Bernardo Cesare’s incredible images are magnified images of pebbles he collected when on holiday in Spain.

To non-geologists most pebbles look relatively alike, but an Italian scientist has revealed their hidden side using a powerful microscope

Professor Cesare, 50, from the University of Padova, Italy, carefully selected pebbles from a beach in Carboneras, Spain, which is known for the variety of geologically different rock available.

‘I was spending my summer vacations with my family at a friends' place on a beautiful beach,’ he explained.

‘The pebbles of the beach were so varied 
in rock colours and textures that I collected a representative selection
 to keep at home.

With these shards of multi-coloured light you could be forgiven for thinking you're looking through a Kaleidoscope rather than the inside of everyday stones gathered from a beach

Professor Bernardo Cesare's incredible images that look like pieces of rainbow are magnified images of pebbles he collected when on holiday in Spain

‘Then it occurred to me that I could make a microscopic reportage with them. So I got thin sections made from the pebbles and took micrographs of them.’

Professor Cesare said he gave the prettiest of the micrographs to his Spanish friends as gifts.

The professor was spending his summer holiday with his family on a beautiful beach when he came up with the idea of analysing the pebbles on it

The pebbles of the beach were so varied in rock colours and textures that he collected a representative selection to keep at home in order to make the magnified images

He made them by using an optical microscope so that light visible to the human eye is captured in his images.

While many scientists favour electron microscopes, the technology would not have captured the stones’ intense colours.

He said the method allows the natural beauty of the internal structures of the rock to come alive.

‘My pictures provide just a small in the micro-world of rocks,’ he said.

Professor Cesare said that by using an optical microscope, the natural beauty of the internal structures of the rock came alive

His striking images show a rainbow of colours and shapes, determined by the composition of each pebble

This image looks more like a piece of modern art, with its dynamic black lines, than the microscopic composition of rock

‘On one hand they can show the order typical of the crystalline nature of minerals as straight lines corresponding to crystal faces.

‘On the other they show irregularity and chaos that also characterise natural processes and the swirling lines that are sometimes seen give the feeling of movement, as a result of deformation during smashing of continents.

‘But this is what I see as a geologist. What you see may be flowers, figures, trees, people and even faces,’ he added.
