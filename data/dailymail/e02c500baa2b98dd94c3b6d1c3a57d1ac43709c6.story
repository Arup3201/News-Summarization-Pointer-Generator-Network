Tulisa Contostavlos sobbed in court today after a judge threw out her appeal against her conviction for punching the celebrity blogger she suspected of putting her sex tape online.

The 26-year-old former X Factor judge was found guilty of hitting the reality star Savvas Morgan at the 2013 V Festival in Chelmsford as he followed her to a Winnebago for a party.

Judge David Radford, sitting at the appeal hearing at Snaresbrook Crown Court today, refused to accept that the singer had not punched him and said she 'lost control'. 

Tulisa Contostavlos, left, lost the appeal for her conviction reality star Savvas Morgan, right, who she says conducted a 'vendetta' against her. Mr Morgan told the court he did not watch X Factor as he lived in L.A.

But the judge said he had the 'greatest sympathy' for Contostavlos and revoked the fines and compensation she had originally been ordered to pay. 

Mr Morgan claimed that the singer has had a grudge against him since he published a link to a sex tape leaked by her ex-boyfriend, rapper Justin Edwards, in 2012.

However, Contostavlos claimed she remained calm during the incident and told the hearing that Mr Morgan had a 'strange obsession' with her and insulted her mentally ill mother.

She also said he conducted a 'vendetta' against her after an incident in which she asked security to remove him from a VIP area at the Whisky Mist nightclub in London's Mayfair. 

Mr Morgan denied the claims and said that when Contostavlos was a judge on the X Factor he did not watch the show as he was living in Los Angeles, where it's not aired.

It was put to Mr Morgan, who has joined the cast of The Only Way Is Essex, by Contostavlos' counsel Simon Gledhill: 'To suggest you don't have an interest in X Factor must be a complete lie.'

Contostavlos (pictured leaving court during a break today) told the appeal hearing that Mr Morgan had a 'strange obsession' with her and outlined suspicions he was involved in releasing a sex tape of her online

He responded: 'Why must that be a complete lie? There's a lot of celebrity things happening daily that I don't have any interest in.' 

Following the three day hearing, Judge Radford said: 'The appellant voiced concerns, for reasons that we understand and have some sympathy for that a person who had been a real thorn in her side, did not accompany her friends to the Winnebago where she was planning on passing the night.

'That's why and only why she then said what she said to Mr Morgan - we don't find that she had a drink in her hand or was in any way demonstrably drunk.

'The argument that undoubtedly followed was no doubt a result of pent up feelings about Mr Morgan which were then now doubt expressed in clear terms and she told us and she accepts that she became uncharacteristically aggressive.'

The judge said it was likely that she had hit Mr Morgan to the left side of his face, but said: 'We've seen no evidence of any injury or of any pain caused.'

He added: 'We do have sympathy with what must have been quite a history of provocation, we accept that she has no previous conviction and this was a very brief moment of loss of control.'

Contostavlos shook her head and fought tears at the appeal hearing today as it became clear the verdict would go against her.

Judge Radford, sitting with two magistrates, said that a security guard who saw the incident was 'undoubtedly independent' and made clear that he saw Contostavlos strike a blow on Mr Morgan.

A woman had also said that what she saw was consistent with a blow having been struck.

Contostavlos was last year convicted of assaulting Mr Morgan at V Festival in Chelmsford in August 2013

The judge said Contostavlos had accepted she became verbally aggressive.

'We find she was not calm, this was a lack of self control - the reasons, we understand - and for a brief moment, we find that she did strike Mr Morgan, before very speedily the incident was brought to an end.'

Circumstantial evidence also supported the Crown's case, the judge said. 

'It is entirely logical so far as what might be expected to happen given the circumstances of the argument, and the previous history between the parties, that that brief excess of lack of control took place.'

The former N-Dubz singer had insisted she had asked Mr Morgan 'diplomatically' to stop following her 15-strong entourage as they headed towards her Winnebago.

Mr Morgan had attempted talking with former Sugababe Mutya Buena, a friend of Contostavlos, as they left the festival to turn in for the night.

Contostavlos said when Mr Morgan turned towards her Winnebago in the VIP area instead of the main exit she politely told him he was not invited to join the party.

The judge said he had the 'greatest sympathy' for Contostavlos and revoked the fines  she had originally been ordered to pay last year

She denied storming up to Mr Morgan aggressively, explaining she only needed to turn around to confront him because of their close proximity.

In a 'calm' and 'diplomatic' manner she told Mr Morgan to go away, the court heard.

'I was calm and relaxed until his instant reaction, which was aggressive. I didn't want to get into an argument or confrontation,' she said. 

Contostavlos said Mr Morgan instantly became aggressive, moving towards her and using abusive language.

He called her a 's***,' 'w****,' 'a nobody' and went on to insult her mentally ill mother, the court heard.

Contostavlos admitted using terms such as 'b******' and 'd*******,' while keeping her hands behind her back throughout.

The incident, which lasted around four minutes, escalated when Contostavlos' personal assistant Gareth Varey confronted Mr Morgan.

Eventually Contostavlos was led away by her tour manager towards the Winnebago as the argument continued.

Varey, was also cleared at magistrates court of using threatening behaviour during the incident

Mr Morgan was left with a puffy eye, the court heard, but claimed that he had lost the photograph he had taken despite being an avid Instagram user.

Contostavlos admitted it was out of character for her to argue, but was adamant she did not become violent. 

She also claimed he followed her and once turned up outside her hotel room in Los Angeles, and other time he unexpectedly showed up at her 23rd birthday party.

She told the court she hoped Mr Morgan would be exposed as a 'liar.'

The singer also claimed Mr Morgan had only become famous off the back of the animosity between the two and was why he had a part on reality TV show The Only Way Is Essex. 

Contostavlos described the release of the sex tape in March 2012 was the 'worst time of my life'.

She was also accused of helping to supply cocaine after she was set up by 'Fake Sheikh' Mazher Mahmood, but her trial collapsed.

Contostavlos, from Friern Barnet, north London, had the fine of £200 and £100 compensation amounts she was previously ordered her to pay revoked, but she was still ordered to pay £1,500 costs and a £15 surcharge.

She managed a wan smile as she left the court building, but did not comment.
