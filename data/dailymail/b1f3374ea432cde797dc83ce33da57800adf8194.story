Ally McCoist tipped Lee Wallace to become only the third Rangers star ever to be inducted into the club’s Hall of Fame while still an Ibrox player.

The Scotland international left back opted to remain with Rangers after they lurched into administration in February 2012 and were then liquidated that summer.

McCoist believes the 26-year-old’s loyalty, combined with his performances on the park while Rangers have travelled up the divisions, is destined for reward once the final stage of the journey is completed.

Backing : Lee Wallace has had a boost from boss Ally McCoist

The Rangers boss is certain that Wallace will one day follow in the footsteps of former Rangers captain David Weir and current skipper Lee McCulloch in becoming Hall of Fame players while still pulling on a light blue jersey.

‘Lee Wallace has been fantastic for me,’ said McCoist. ‘Along with our captain, Lee McCulloch, he has been absolutely vital in giving us the stability on the park after administration and liquidation.‘We badly needed to have that stability, and I also count Neil Alexander (the former Rangers goalkeeper who is now at Hearts) in that, too.

Stability: Wallace has been at Ibrox through thick and thin

‘But the contributions of Wallace and McCulloch, in particular, have been so valuable over the past two seasons. And I fully expect it to be the same this coming season in the Scottish Championship.

‘It would be fantastic for those two boys to have on their CV that they went through the leagues as captain and vice-captain of Rangers. They have already shown great loyalty to stay here. And by going from playing at Annan and Elgin all the way back to the top flight in Scottish football? Well that would be a great story alright.

‘I look at the names of the Hall of Fame board as I walk up the marble staircase at Ibrox. I know McCulloch’s name is on it already, but, although I might be biased, I think Wallace is an absolute certainty to join him. And there would be no-one more deserving.’

McCoist also describe as ‘invaluable’ the contribution made by both Wallace and McCulloch off the park, in helping newcomers cope with the pressures of playing for Rangers.

He said: ‘The most important aspect is on the park because you need to win games – and they have been outstanding for me. But it’s every aspect, really.

‘They’ve helped the guys who came into Rangers and, to be honest, didn’t know that much about the club. They’ve coaxed them through the difficult moments. Like when you are 3-0 up at Ibrox and you get the odd boo for a bad pass.

‘That can be tough to take for someone who does not know this club and its surroundings.

'So I simply cannot tell you how important Wallace and McCulloch have been for this club.

‘If I hadn’t had guys like that to call on, my job would have been so much harder.

‘They deserve an enormous amount of praise from the supporters and from ourselves as the management team for helping us through this period.’
