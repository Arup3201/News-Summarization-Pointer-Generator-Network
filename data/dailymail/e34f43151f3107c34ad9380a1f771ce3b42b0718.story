Ambushed: PC Nicola Hughes, who was killed aged just 23 in the line of duty when she was gunned down by fugitive killer Dale Cregan in Manchester

Two former Scotland Yard chiefs enraged frontline officers yesterday by opposing full life terms for police killers.

Moves to make such murderers die behind bars are a PR exercise and the ‘contemporary version of hanging’, according to Lord Condon and Lord Blair.

But Ian Hanson, whose police colleagues Nicola Hughes and Fiona Bone were shot dead in 2012, said the peers should hang their heads in shame. 

‘They sit in the splendour of the 
House of Lords and do so only by virtue of having had the honour of 
wearing the same uniform as those who have given their lives protecting 
our communities,’ he said.

‘Yet now they forget their roots and speak in defence of the rights of police murderers.’

The
 Greater Manchester Police Federation chairman added: ‘The men and women
 of our police service put their lives on the line every day to protect 
us all and need our protection.

'An attack upon a police officer is an attack upon every decent citizen.’

Ian
 Pointon, who chairs the Kent Police Federation, said there was an 
unwritten contract between our largely unarmed police service and the 
public.

He added: ‘Society 
relies on police officers to get out there and protect them and they do 
that unarmed, but in return if somebody does kill a police officer they 
should die in prison.’

Home 
Secretary Theresa May revealed the proposed change in the law at the 
Police Federation annual conference last year. It was a popular move 
with rank-and-file officers.

Before the abolition of the death penalty, 
the murder of an officer was a ‘capital homicide’ with an automatic 
death penalty.

Mrs May said: ‘We are clear – life should mean life for anyone convicted of killing a police officer.’

The current minimum sentence is 30 years and in some cases police killers have been told they will die behind bars.

Dale Cregan, the 31-year-old killer of Constables Hughes and Bone, was jailed for a whole life term in June 2013.

But
 American David Bieber, 48, who murdered PC Ian Broadhurst in Leeds in 
2003 by shooting him at point-blank range, had his whole life term 
overturned on appeal.

The 
Court of Appeal later ruled he could apply for parole after 37 years, a 
decision which led one police leader to accuse the judiciary of having 
‘blood on its hands’.

Lord Blair, left, branded the move to make police killers serve whole-life sentences 'unnecessary and populist'. Lord Condon, right, said the change 'feels like a piece of symbolic, public relations legislation'

Life tariffs are due to be enshrined in law in the Criminal Justice and Courts Bill which is currently passing through the House of Lords.

But, during debates, Lords Blair and Condon have both spoken out in strong terms to oppose the clause which introduces whole life tariffs.

They were backed by Lord Paddick, who also served as a senior Met officer, and Lord Dear, who led West Midlands Police for five years.

Lord Blair, whose tenure as Met commissioner between 2005 and 2008 was dogged by questions about his judgment, leadership and politically correct style, branded the change ‘unnecessary and populist’.

He said there was ‘no evidence of judicial complacency’ when it came to sentencing police killers. And he said a whole life term is the ‘contemporary version of hanging’, adding: ‘This measure is simply dangerous, unhelpful and totally misguided.’

Lord Condon, who led the Met for seven years until 2000, said the change ‘feels like a piece of symbolic, public relations legislation’.

He fears that a criminal on the run after a police murder might choose to ‘shoot, stab or bludgeon’ other officers as he has ‘nothing more to fear’.

Both men pointed out that Harry Roberts, who killed three police officers in 1966, remains in prison and his accomplices have died.

Policing minister Mike Penning said: ‘We are making this change because we recognise the unique and dangerous job that police and prison officers do on a daily basis and we place the highest value upon their safety.

'We recognise that the courts already treat these cases very seriously, and it will remain for them to determine the appropriate sentence in each case based on all the facts. But the Government considers that the starting point in these cases should be a whole life order.’

The Criminal Justice and Courts Bill has been working its way through Parliament for several months.

It is in the committee stage in the House of Lords, in which peers propose amendments. They will continue their work after the summer recess.

Dale Cregan: Killed WPCs Nicola Hughes, 23, and Fiona Bone, 32, while the subject of a huge manhunt after murdering a father and son.

The officers died in a hail of bullets and even had a grenade thrown at them after Cregan ambushed them in Manchester in September 2012. 

The gangster, who has a false eye made of onyx, later handed himself in at a police station. He was convicted of all four murders, plus three attempted murders, and jailed for life.

David Bieber: Shot dead PC Ian Broadhurst after officers spotted  he was driving a stolen BMW in Leeds on Boxing Day, 2003. 

Bieber, an American, was eventually caught in a Gateshead hotel room. 

He was given a life sentence in December 2004 and told he will  never be released – however, this sentence was overturned four years later.

Could be released in 2041.

Magdi Elgizouli: The jobless drifter stabbed WPC Nina Mackay, 25, to death with a kitchen knife as she attempted to arrest him at a flat in East London in October 1997.

Elgizouli, a schizophrenic  with a pathological hatred of police, was detained indefinitely after admitting manslaughter on the grounds of  diminished responsibility.  He was released in 2012, with officials ordering that he be housed in an area with few police patrolling the streets in order to protect his mental health.

Harry Roberts: The 78-year-old  is one of Britain’s longest-serving and most notorious prisoners. 

He shot dead two officers, and an accomplice fatally shot a third, when his van was approached by plain-clothes police in West London in 1966.  The double-killer, who was jailed for life and ordered to serve a minimum term of 30 years, remains in prison today.

The slayings prompted calls to reintroduce the death penalty – abolished a year  earlier – for those who kill police.

In the wake of Cregan's conviction, former Tory chairman Lord Tebbit said it was time to think again of the 'deterrent effect of the shadow of the gallows'

Calls to reintroduce the death penalty  for police killers have been made repeatedly since the punishment was abandoned in  the Sixties.

Many believe the decision to end capital punishment in 1965 came with assurances that those who murder police would die behind bars.

As recently as two years ago – in the wake of one-eyed gangster Dale Cregan’s murder of two WPCs – senior Tories said criminals who target those protecting the public should face the ultimate punishment.

Former party chairman Lord Tebbit said it was time to think again of the ‘deterrent effect of the shadow of the gallows’.

His colleague Nick de Bois said: ‘Police officers potentially put their lives on the line every day, and therefore someone who murders a police officer should face the most severest of punishments.

‘Whether that is a life sentence without the possibility of release or the death penalty is something that I believe Parliament should debate, as there is a massive public interest in this.  The fact is that these killers don’t fear the law, and they need to.’

The Police Federation, which represents rank-and-file officers, has long called for the death penalty for police killers – or, at the very least, automatic whole-life tariffs.

Capital punishment was banned for an initial trial period in 1965, with the last criminal hanged in 1964. The death penalty was formally abolished in Britain in 1969.

There was concern at the time, however, that the punishment should be retained for certain forms of murder – including the killing of a police officer.
