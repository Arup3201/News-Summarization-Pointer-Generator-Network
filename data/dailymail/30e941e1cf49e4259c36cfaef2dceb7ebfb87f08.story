South Korean rhythmic gymnast Soo-ji Shin was invited to throw the ceremonial first pitch at a recent game in the Jamsil Stadium in SeoulÂ  and pitched an acrobatic ball that left even the boys in the dugout gaping.

With perfect poise she took her position then proceeded to effect possibly the most impressive wind-up in the history of baseball.

Leaving one foot on the ground, the petite gymnast twisted her body around in a full flip before straightening and launching the ball.

Skill: Soo-Ji Shin performs a rhythmic gymnastics routine

The
 ceremonial first pitch is a longstanding ritual in baseball and usually
 guest of honor is a dignitary or celebrity in attendance at the game.

The pitcher may be a luminary, an actor, even a President - but the pitch itself is usually very average.

Shin is going to be a hard act to follow.

Soo-ji Shin has lifted the game, not just in terms of the theater of the first pitch, but in throwing a quality ball, too.

The players from the competing teams, the Doosan Bears and the Samsung Lions, could only look on with wide eyes as Shin twirled her body around in the wind-up.

Some of them were probably wishing they had such flexibility on the field.

From all reports, Shin's gymnastics career is going very well - she competed at the Beijing 2008 Olympics.

But if she ever decides on a change of sports, major league baseball may just open its door to her.
