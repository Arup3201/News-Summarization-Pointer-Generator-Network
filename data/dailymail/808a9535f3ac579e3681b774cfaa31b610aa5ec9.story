A mother in Washington state is accused of sex-trafficking her own teenage daughter.

The 44-year-old was recently arrested by sheriff's deputies in Snohomish County  and is facing charges of promoting the sexual abuse of a minor - a Class A felony.

Detectives started tracking the teen late last year through a classified advert offering her services on backpage.com for liaisons at motels in Everett, Edmonds and Fife. The advert claimed the girl was 18, but she was actually 15 at the time.

A search warrant  of texts on the girl's iPhone from a five-week period late last year uncovered more than 400 messages from potential clients.

More than a dozen others involved discussions related to drugs, reports The Daily Herald.

The exchanges also included texts allegedly from the girl's mother, asking her for her motel room number and what city she was in.

After the teen allegedly had a client walk away without paying, the woman allegedly wrote text messages telling her 'Never give (people) anything without paying upfront' and 'Next time get paid upfront.'

At one point, the mother allegedly wrote her daughter to find another hotel room for the night rather than come home.

When the daughter reportedly asked her mom, 'Is the money worth it?' her mother allegedly replied, 'Yes, it sure is.' 

An acquaintance of the teen told the detective that the girl said 'her mom was very well aware of what she was doing and encouraged it because she enjoyed the money.'

In an interview with the sheriff's detective earlier this month, the teen allegedly said her mom knew about her work as a prostitute. 

She reportedly estimated that she gave her mom about $2,000 from her earnings as a prostitute over the past year and that her mom often picks her up at motels.
