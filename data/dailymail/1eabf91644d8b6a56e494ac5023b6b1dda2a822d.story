New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio portrayed himself as a man of the people in last year's election. On Saturday, he became a pirate among mermaids.

De Blasio showed up for Saturday's 32nd annual zany Coney Island Mermaid Parade wearing a puffy pirate shirt and brandishing a fake sword. Organizers say he's the first mayor to come in costume.

De Blasio's wife, Chirlane McCray, and their daughter, Chiara de Blasio, chose blue and gold mermaid dresses.

De Blasio's son, Dante, was bare-chested and painted blue.

Dante and Chiara were chosen King Neptune and Queen Mermaid of the parade.The teens were wheeled in a 1923 wicker rolling chair along the parade route.

'I want you to look for the tallest pirate you've ever seen,' an announcer shouted from the reviewing stand.

'That would be the mayor,' said the announcer according to Newsday.

The crowd cheered and rushed to take photographs of the vibrant New York political family dressed in their most festive garb.

Newsday
 reports there was only one boo heard from the audience and it came from
 a man against de Blasio's bend against Central Park hansom cabs.

De
 Blasio's children have played a big role in their father's political 
life and their multicultural background has gained positive attention 
from voters.

Photos of the family have been featured in campaign ads and on television.

During
 the parade, a 65-year-old fan named Maria Ramos of Canarsie Brooklyn 
waved a rainbow flag for the LGBT-rights movement in honour of her son 
who is gay.

'I love that you live this flag,' she shouted towards the liberal mayor and his family.

De Blasio turned to acknowledge her kind words and blow her a kiss.

At the end of the parade, de Blasio and his teenage son got into a sword fight for play.

Dante used his trident to playfully joust with his father.

'We have become friends now,' de Blasio joked after they tied.

The event draws hundreds of thousands of revelers to the beach each year. Many wear revealing, mermaid-themed costumes.
