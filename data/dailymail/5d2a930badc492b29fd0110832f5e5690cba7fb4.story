Though not even finished yet, the Walkie Talkie tower on London's Eastcheap is already attracting attention. 

One of the famous building's concave surfaces is reflecting a bright beam of sunlight onto the street below, stopping Londoners in their tracks with a sudden flurry of light and heat. 

Passers-by are being forced to shield their eyes from the blinding light which is being given off by glass windows recently installed on the south side of the building.

Shining bright: The building reflects sunlight from its glass windows of which there are hundreds. Once completed it will have 37-storeys

Both the north and south sides of 20 
Fenchurch Street, as the building set to open next year is 
officially known, are concave while the the east and west sides are 
convex.

The upper 
floors of the building are wider, to give off the impression it is bursting into the London skyline. Costing over £200million, 
the skyscraper will be 525ft once completed in 2014.

Designed by Uruguayan architect Rafael 
Viñoly, the tower's top three floors will feature a sky garden and a 
large viewing deck which will be open to the public.

Several insurance companies have agreed to become tenants upon its completion, it is believed.

City workers today had mixed reactions to unexpected hotspot created by the reflected light.

Thirty-eight-year-old PR consultant, David Banks, said: 'It is like a huge lens. It 
is magnifying the sunbeam - I would not like to predict what kind of 
intensity greater than normal sunlight, but I am sure it is multiple 
times.

'It’s like trying to fry ants with a magnifying glass.'

Ania Gzik, an insurance worker, said she couldn't believe how hot the spot became when the light was reflected and plans to warm up there when winter comes

Mr
Banks from Eltham, southeast London, told the Evening Standard: 'It was
uncomfortable to be underneath and I was conscious that it was 
probably unsafe to spend too long under that particular beam.'

He raised another cause for concern by suggesting the light could distract or impair motorists as it casts blinding rays into their eye-line as the day goes on.

Other passers-by were happy to enjoy the sudden spot of heat, like Nadia Hassini, 22, who compared it to a sunbed.

'To be walking along a city street and to feel that is amazing. It is a bit too hot though, and it does dazzle you,' she said.

Insurance worker Ania Gzik shared Miss Hassini's excitement, saying she'd be coming back to the hotspot once winter came around.

'It's amazing, I cannot believe how hot it is on that spot,' said Ms Gzik.

In a statement the developer of the building, Land Securities, said it was satisfied with the design.

It said: “We took advice on such matters during the design stages of the project and are satisfied that steps have been taken to ensure such risks have been mitigated.”

A spokesperson said no complaints had been received.
