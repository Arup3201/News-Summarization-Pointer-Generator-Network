A popular charity fundraiser who made hundreds of thousands of people laugh with his internet videos has been killed in a car crash, police have said.

Andrew Corfield, 39, died following the collision at 7.30pm yesterday in Hemlington, Middlesbrough. An 18-year-old was arrested afterwards on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving and stealing a car.

A witness claimed that after the crash the man 'got out of the car and jumped over a back fence and ran off'.

Andrew Corfield died at the crash scene yesterday with locals later saying it was a 'horrible day for Hemlington'

Mr Corfield's daughter Alice, 17, who was a passenger in her father's vehicle, was rushed to James Cook University Hospital following the collision between Mr Corfield's silver Ford Fiesta Zetec and a Hyundai Santa Fe. She is in a critical condition.

Locals this evening described Mr Corfield as a 'lovely bloke' and said his death was a 'horrible day for Hemlington'.

Mr Corfield, a crane driver, raised funds for the Lullaby Trust following the cot death of his baby son Jack in 1995.

He completed the Loch Ness marathon last year despite a painful knee injury and raised more than £6,000.

The dock worker also took part in a parachute jump for Teenage Cancer Trust after his eldest daughter, Amy, suffered ovarian cancer in 2010.

Mr Corfield created the popular Boro Pat videos, where the children's cartoon character Postman Pat was overdubbed with a filthy dialogue spoken in a thick Teesside accent.

The spoof videos have been watched hundreds of thousands of times online.

Flowers were left at Cass House Road after the crash with one message saying: 'What a waste of life.'

Tributes to Mr Corfield have been paid on Facebook and flowers have been laid on Cass House Road where the fatal crash happened yesterday evening.

One tribute read: 'A part of Hemo's soul died here. What a waste of life.'

Another said: 'Your memories will never fade kid.'

A witness of the fatal crash at the junction of Cass House Road and Fordyce Road said: 'It was really horrible.

'It looked like the lad was going too fast and as soon as the crash happened, he got out of the car and jumped over a back fence and ran off.

He added: 'It is a horrible day for Hemlington.'

Another said: 'We heard three loud bangs, and came outside.

'You see young lads driving up and down here all the time, speeding. But nothing has ever happened like this.'

Neighbours who lived near Mr Corfield in Hemlington described him as a 'lovely bloke' who 'everyone round here knew'.

The father of two created the X-rated Boro Pat videos with his friend, Neil McLoughlin.

Mr Corfield said of the spoof videos: 'I think the Middlesbrough sense of humour is the best in the world because it comes from people who don't have a lot but just get on with it and enjoy life.'

Mr Corfield was married to Lisa, and also father to their children Owen and Amy, and grandfather to Amy's daughter, Lucy.

A Cleveland Police spokesman said: 'An 18-year-old man arrested in connection with the incident remains in police custody this afternoon.'

Anyone who saw the crash should call 101.
