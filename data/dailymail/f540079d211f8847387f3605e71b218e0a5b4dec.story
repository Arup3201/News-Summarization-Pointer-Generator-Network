Paul Lambert has revealed Aston Villa have an option to sign Tom Cleverley in January.

The midfielder is on loan from Manchester United and Lambert has been impressed with him since his summer arrival.

Villa can make the deal permanent in January but Lambert will wait until the transfer window opens before making any decision.

Lambert said: 'We have an option on Tom. We have not gone into great detail but he has played well. He was the one lad who was busy on Saturday (at Everton), he has so much to offer.

'He's a good guy, a good professional and does everything high tempo even when he trains.

'Whatever happens in January will happen, the option is there but we still have a couple of months to go.

'I just want him to play well here and enjoy it and that's what he is doing which is half the battle.

'It's not been an easy start playing at a new club but come January we will see.'

Lambert takes Villa to QPR on Monday after their 3-0 defeat at Everton last week and hopes Philippe Senderos will be fit after a thigh problem.

He added: 'They've had a good week. Everton deserved it Saturday and we need to make sure it does not happen again.'
