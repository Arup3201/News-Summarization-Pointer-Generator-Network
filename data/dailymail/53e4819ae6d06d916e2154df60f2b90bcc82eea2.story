A gay wedding at the British ambassador's residence in Beijing at the weekend has sparked outrage in China.

Wearing matching slippers and bow ties, Brian Davidson, 50, Britain's consul-general in Shanghai, married his 33-year-old American boyfriend Scott Chang on the lawn of the home of Ambassador Sir Sebastian Wood.

New rules mean that British nationals in homosexual relationships can marry in British consulates in 24 countries around the world as the land where the building stands is technically British soil.

However, whilst the ambassador posted a picture of himself and the couple on Sina Weibo, a Chinese equivalent of Twitter, holding a red card bearing the legend 'Keep calm and marry on', not everyone was as happy.

'That country is clearly sick. It's like the last days of Rome,' one person wrote in an online comment.

'I respect foreign gay culture. But it's not Chinese culture. Please respect that,' wrote another.

A third suggested that same-sex unions threaten family ethics and destabilise society. Some said that the two men had 'mental illness' and that their children would have 'personality issues'. 

Mr Davidson boasts about his good news on Sina Weibo, a Chinese equivalent of Twitter, followed by good wishes from Ambassador Sebastian Wood - 'Keep Calm and Marry on!'

Brian Davidson hails from Northern Ireland and has worked as Consul-General in Shanghai since January 2011. He was previously Consul-General in Guangzhou from October 2006.

He said that he was surprised at the response to his posting on Sina Weibo: 'The scale of the coverage has been a bit daunting but it has mostly been very positive.' 

A spokesman for Britain's embassy in Beijing confirmed to Agence France-Presse that the wedding had taken place, but said that the couple viewed it as a 'private matter'.

Attitudes to homosexuality in China is mixed and, as in most countries, it is in the bigger cities were people are more relaxed. Gay relationships are not illegal in China but same-sex couples are not recognised as such and homosexuals face widespread stigma.

China has not lodged a protest although Hong Kong, the former British colony, has made it clear that same-sex marriages will not be tolerated there.
