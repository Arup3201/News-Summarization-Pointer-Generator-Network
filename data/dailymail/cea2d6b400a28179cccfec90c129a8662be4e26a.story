Marion Bartoli says she has no regrets about retiring shortly after winning Wimbledon a year ago.

She also says she logs onto YouTube every couple of days to watch her last-point ace that ended the 2013 final at the All England Club.

About six weeks after winning her only Grand Slam trophy, Bartoli announced she was quitting the sport at age 28.Â

Bartoli is the first reigning women's champion at Wimbledon since 1997 to decline to try to defend her title.

Still, she held the traditional defending champion's pre-tournament news conference Sunday.

She tugged down the collar of her white sweater to reveal blue tape providing support for her right shoulder and said: 'Literally, I can't even lift my arm every morning. ... So definitely no regrets at all.'
