UK Scouting membership has grown by almost a quarter in the last 10 years - and there are now more than half a million Scouts.

The Scout Association said its membership has shot up from 450,455 to 550,457 members in the last decade, and in this time female membership has grown from 69,996 to 128,042.

The number of adults volunteering has increased by 14,596 in 10 years to a total of 104,28, but more than 40,000 young people want to join and are unable to because more adult volunteers are required to help, the Association said.

Chief Scout Bear Grylls said scouting gives young people the chance of adventure and teaches them positive life skills

The figures are based on findings from the Scout Association's latest census, which is carried out annually to identify trends and development areas in the movement.

The Association said it is launching a plan to recruit a further 58,000 young people, as well as 18,000 more adult volunteers by 2018.

Over the past 18 months, the movement said it has focused on delivering its youth work in more deprived parts of the UK, using funding supplied by central government via the Youth United Foundation.

Scouting has worked hard to change the public's perception of the organisation

This funding has enabled the recruitment of 1,553 more young members and 315 adult volunteers in areas such as Newham, Salford, Burnley and Merseyside.

Wayne Bulpitt, UK chief commissioner, said: 'Scouting offers young people and adults alike a chance of real adventure. Scouting changes young people's lives and the communities in which they live for the better.

'We have a clear plan to make the movement more diverse, more community-focused and more youth-led in the next four years.

'Ultimately this means we want to recruit another 18,000 adults by 2018 so that they can help offer life-changing adventures to 58,000 more young people.'

Allowing girls join the Scouts has seen membership of the organisation increase by more than 100,000

Chief Scout Bear Grylls said being a Scout 'empowers' people, and he said he is "excited" to see membership increasing.

'I am super-proud to see so many young people and adults learning new life skills, achieving personal rewards through Scouting in the UK.

'I am excited to see Scout numbers continue to rise across the UK and the big reasons for this are that more and more young people are realising that Scouting can give them so much - whether it's the opportunity to be involved with some incredible adventures, learn practical life, outdoor and teamwork skills, or helping to improve their local communities.

'People don't want to miss out and Scouting brings them all together, empowers them and allows them to make a positive impact,' he said.
