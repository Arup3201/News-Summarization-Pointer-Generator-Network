Whether you're buying your first home or purchasing an investment property, the real estate market can be a difficult place to navigate.

Prices are constantly on the rise, especially near Australian capital cities. Even purchasing land on its own can be a costly move.

Daily Mail Australia spoke to property and real estate experts across the nation and asked them to pinpoint where they would purchase property if they were looking for their first home.

They were given a budget of $400,000 and asked to pick a property in any suburb they saw fit as long as it was suitable for someone to move into almost immediately.

Looking to  buy? Properties like this three-bedroom home between Brisbane and the Gold Coast offer first home buyer or investors fantastic value at around $400,000, real estate agents say

The experts also provided reasons they chose that particular home based on factors such as affordability, size, suburb, accessibility and of course location.

The result is a list of properties in New South Wales, Queensland, Victoria, South Australia and West Australia currently on the market that could be snapped up for no more than $400,000. 

NEW SOUTH WALES

Chris Gray, CEO of buyers agency Your Empire, chose a studio apartment just minutes from Sydney's bustling CBD as his pick for first home buyers in New South Wales.

Located in Neutral Bay, just a 10 minute drive from the city centre, the property at 6/1 Spruson Street has spectacular harbour views but it also just a stone's throw from the action.

'This could be a great bachelor or bachelorette city pad for those that want amazing views as well as access to the heart of the action, whilst still being in a quiet location close to the city. It’s small but it’s a price almost everyone can afford,' Mr Gray told Daily Mail Australia.

On the market for $320,000 and up, the open plan home came in well under the $400,000 budget. It also features a neat kitchen and bathroom.

The studio apartment is on the market for $320,000 and is located just minutes from the CBD

The property has sweeping views of the iconic Sydney Harbour Bridge and a small outdoor living area

Positives of the property outlined by Mr Gray were the sweeping views of the Sydney Harbour Bridge, the location being just 500 metres from a ferry and the 2-3 kilometre walk into the city.

He also pointed out the outdoor living area in the form of a balcony and the potential for renovations as other strong points of the apartment.

One downside Mr Gray noted was the high strata fees due to its location.

'But as an emotional first home purchase, you’ll have plenty of fun there,' he added. 

Managing Director at SQM Research Louis Christopher recommended a different part of the state for those looking to purchase a property

Mr Christopher suggested suburbs such as St Marys in Sydney's west were a great place to purchase

He said while the location may not be perfect, as a first home buyer you may need to make sacrifices

Managing Director at SQM Research Louis Christopher recommended a different part of the state for those looking to purchase a property.

Mr Christopher said suburbs such as St Marys in Sydney's west are perfect for those with a slightly smaller budget but who are looking for something a little larger.

He cited the growing population, prosperity and affordability of the area as very attractive factors when buying a home there. And he added that from most parts it was just a 40 minute ride into the city by train.

'I think people would be surprised that you can still find a property under $400,000 but you can', Mr Christopher told Daily Mail Australia.

'It may not be in your ideal location but as a first home buyer you have to make sacrifices,' he said.

The nearby suburb of Willmot also had a number of houses on the market for less than $400,000

Mr Christopher said a fibro home, such as this one on the market from $309,950, were a good pick

He said employment rates in NSW are on the rise and the suburb was a good investment

Mr Christopher added that for NSW as a whole unemployment rates are down and the standard of infrastructure is increasing. 

Daily Mail Australia chose two examples of properties like the ones Mr Christopher described above: one in St Marys and another in the nearby suburb of Willmot.

The first is a three bedroom two bathroom freestanding townhouse on John Street, St Marys.

On the market for $389,950 each bedroom in the house has its own built in wardrobe and the master has an en-suite. There's also a double garage and is within walking distance to schools and local shops.

The second property is a fibro home with three bedrooms, one bathroom and a neat kitchen.

It comes well under the budget at $309,950 - $339,950 and has a sizeable garden, which is nearby to shops and schools in the area.

'It really depends on where you work to where you live', he told Daily Mail Australia.

But when asked to choose one suburb, Mr Elliott pointed to the new development of Yarrabilba between Brisbane and the Gold Coast.

'You can get a really nice home, brand new three bedroom for under $400,000,' he said.
