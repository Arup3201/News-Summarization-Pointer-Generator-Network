Francois Hollande was due to hold crisis talks with Indian steel magnate Lakshmi Mittal today after Boris Johnson encouraged him to give up France and move to Britain.

The London Mayor accused the Socialist government in Paris of acting like working class revolutionaries - or 'sans culottes' - after telling Mittal, one of the richest men in the world, to get out of their country.

On Monday, President Hollande's industry minister Arnaud Montebourg accused Mr Mittal's company, ArcelorMittal, of 'lying' and 'blackmail' and suggested he left, along with his 20,000 jobs.

Way to go: The London Mayor told the gathering: 'I have no hesitation in saying here, Venez Londres, mes amis!' which translates as 'Come to London, my friends!'

This prompted Mr Johnson to tell a meeting of Indian business leaders: 'The sans-culottes appear to have captured the government in Paris. I have no hesitation in saying here, Venez Londres, mes amis!' which translates as  'Come to London, my friends!'

French Socialist Party sources today said they were furious by Mr Johnson's intervention, saying he had 'completely missed the point' of Mr Montebourg's words.

'He was not attacking a company for being in France, but for treating workers so badly,' one source told the Evening Standard.

'The idea was that countries like France should have some control over the decisions of international business people. In these circumstances, Mr Johnson's intervention was most unwelcome.'

French Minister for Industrial Recovery Arnaud Montebourg accused ArcelorMittal, the world's largest steel producer owned by Lakshmi Mittal, (left) of lying and blackmail and suggested they should leave the country

Mr Mittal, who has a number of other 
business interests in France, was accused by Mr Montebourg of giving up 
on France after he announced the closure of two blast furnaces in the 
north-eastern region of Florange.

Mr
Hollande will discuss a number of measures aimed at resolving the 
dispute today, including the possibility of temporarily nationalising Mr
Mittal's assets.

The 
Anglo-French row over the best place to do business follows Prime 
Minister David Cameron saying in May that he would 'roll out the red 
carpet' and 'welcome more French businesses to Britain' as Mr Hollande 
raised taxes on the rich.

Mr Cameron said that by paying British 
taxes, French firms could help 'pay for our health service and schools 
and everything else'.

But Claude Bartolone, leader of the Paris parliament, said his countrymen who moved to London for lower tax rates always returned to France for medical care and schools because public services 'no longer exist' in Britain.

The 'sans-culottes' were 1789 French 
revolutionaries who wore trousers rather than the fancy knee-breeches or
culottes mainly worn by the middle classes at the time.

Mr Johnson, who described Mr Montebourg as 'eccentric', added in his speech in India: 'Come to London, come to the business capital of the world, the place where 73 Indian firms are listed on the London Stock Exchange, where Indian companies already raise 53 per cent of their international equity, a city that has the largest banking and financial sector anywhere in the world, but which is at the cutting edge of all the great growth businesses of the 21st Century.'
