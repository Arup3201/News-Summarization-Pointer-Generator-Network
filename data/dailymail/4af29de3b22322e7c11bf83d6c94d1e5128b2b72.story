There is new drama between Anna 'Chickadee' Cardwell and her mother June 'Mama June' Shannon.

In an appearance on Dr. Phil that will air Thursday, Anna claims that her mother has robbed her of money from her trust fund and lied about her knowledge of her daughter's sexual abuse at the hands of her former lover, Mark McDaniel.

June claims that she did not know that Anna had been sexually abused by McDaniel, a convicted sex offender, until almost three years ago, over eight years after the incident first took place in 2002.

Lies: Anna 'Chickadee' Cardwell (above) says in a new interview that her mother, June 'Mama June Shannon, is a liar who has robbed her trust fund

Fighting words: 'She's lied my entire life,' says Anna of June (above), 'She doesn’t have the ability to tell the truth'

Looking out: Anna says she is nervous about her younger sister Alana (above) now that she believes her mother is back with Mark McDaniel, the man who sexually abused her as a child

Anna tells Dr. Phil a much different story however, saying her mother knew just weeks after the incident occurred.

'She's lied my entire life,' Anna says, according to US Weekly. 

'She doesn’t have the ability to tell the truth.'

As for her trust fund, Anna claims that she has not seen the $15,400 she had put away as compensation for appearing on the reality show Here Comes Honey Boo Boo, money her mother said she had sent her in a cashier's check.

'I gave her $400 a month,' said June in a previously taped interview.

'I didn't have to give her that till she turned 21. And then, I've got a cashier's check that I can show you that I sent her, which was the rest of the money in her account.'

Anna says she has never seen that check.

'You say your mother robbed your trust fund?' asks Dr. Phil. 

'So I call the bank in Milledgeville, and I ask him, I say, "Hey, is there any account underneath my name,"' Anna responds. 

'They said, 'Yeah, there is a savings account with 17 dollars and 89 cents in it.'' 

She then adds that because she was a minor when the show began, all accounts are controlled by her mother.

Coming clean: Anna revealed this all during an appearance on Dr. Phil set to air Thursday

Anna will be appearing on the show alongside her grandmother Thursday, with the two getting a surprise visit from Lee Thompson, better known as Uncle Poodle.

Anna and Lee have not spoken in over a year, though the reason for this is not made clear in the preview. 

The young girl says she is concerned about protecting her youngest sister, Alana, from McDaniel, especially after photos suggested that he and June were together again. 

Anna, 20, had previously claimed she was sexually abused for months by McDaniel back in 2002 while her mother was working at McDonald's.

She said the abuse occurred in her mother's bed and, at times, while her little sister Lauryn 'Pumpkin' Shannon was in the room 

McDaniel, 53, served 10 years behind bars beginning in 2004 for child molestation. 

New episodes of Honey Boo Boo, along with repeats, were shelved by TLC once photos of June and McDaniel together showed up on TMZ.
