Comedian Billy Connolly has stopped taking his medication for Parkinson's disease because doctors told him he was experiencing worse side effects than those of the illness

Billy Connolly has stopped taking medication to treat Parkinson’s disease because he claims the side effects are more damaging than the illness.

The comedian, who discovered he had the degenerative brain disorder when a fan told him he was showing early signs of the illness, told a US chat show he had stopped taking the medication.

Speaking to chat show host Conan O'Brien, the 71-year-old said doctors took him off the medication.

He said: ‘They reckon the side effects were stronger than the effects because it’s very early days.

‘It’s a weird medicine. I asked, “what are the side effects?” and they told me, “an overriding interest in sex and gambling”.

‘So if you see somebody in Las Vegas with an erection, he’s probably got Parkinson’s.’

The actor was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease after an Australian fan, who happened to be a doctor, spotted him walking strangely and advised him to see a GP.

There are several possible side effects caused by the medication
used to treat Parkinson’s disease including nausea, hallucinations, tiredness
and blurred vision.

The Scottish star, who is married to psychologist Pamela Stephenson, 64, and has five children from his two marriages, announced last year he had undergone surgery for prostate cancer. He was given the all-clear in December.

This week, he announced he was set to front a two-part documentary called The Big Send Off which will show him revealing the way he wants to die.

Due to be aired on ITV in May, the show will see him visit his ‘favourite graveyard’ in his home city of Glasgow and reveal stories about funerals he has attended, including that of Who drummer Keith Moon.
