Jailed for eight years: Gary Bennison, 24, of Hornchurch, Essex, fractured the spine of the infant

A father who shook his four-month-old son to leave him brain damaged and blamed the tot’s older brother for inflicting the injuries has been jailed for eight years.

Gary Bennison, 24, of Hornchurch, Essex, fractured the spine of the infant - now aged two - and broke three of his ribs after attacking him when he was just three weeks old.

Three months later he left the child with multiple bleeds to the brain and cerebral swelling after shaking him in fury, a court heard. But Bennison claimed his other son was responsible for the injuries.

After a trial at Snaresbrook Crown Court in north-east London the father-of-two was convicted of carrying out two separate attacks on his son.

Judge Joanna Korner QC told him: ‘The victim of this serious assault was your own son - he was not even four months old.

'You shook him with such violence that the doctor said it must have been repeated cycles of shaking to cause multiple haemorrhages to the brain and cerebral swelling.

‘Despite overwhelming evidence that all injuries were caused by you, you continued to deny it and persistently blamed your older son - who was only two years old - for the injuries to the brain.

‘Had you persuaded the jury that he was responsible for those injuries, for the rest of his life he would have to live with the false information that he had injured his younger brother so badly that his life was irreparably changed for the worse’.

Bennison had savagely attacked his son when he was just three weeks old in February last year. Then on May 19, he deliberately shook the infant while he was looking after his two sons.

The baby started vomiting and had to be taken to hospital, said Mark Horsley, prosecuting. Doctors then found rib and spinal injuries consistent with heavy blows to the back, the court heard.

‘He was left with fractures to the ribs and spine which was only found by doctors after he was examined fully at the hospital’, Judge Korner added.

‘Doctors found healing fractures to three ribs and fractures to his spine - compression fractures. Both sites required considerable force to have been caused by you.

‘The rib fractures were caused by compression to the chest and to the spine, slamming the baby on his bottom or the bottom of his spine.

‘It is not possible to accurately date 
when these injuries occurred, but it was three to four weeks before May 
19 - therefore when he was only three months old’.

Recent tests have shown the victim 
still has abnormalities to the frontal lobe of his brain and that his 
development has been delayed by his injuries.

Mr Horsey said further research has to be done to ascertain the long-term impact of his injuries.

The court heard Bennison has since 
been in a relationship with another woman with young children after the 
mother of his two children left him.

Sentencing
 Bennison to eight years behind bars, Judge Korner said: ‘There is a 
high risk of reoffending if you engage in relationships, as you have 
done, with women who have young children.

'There can be no greater position of trust than a parent left in charge of their young baby - and you abused that trust'

Judge Joanna Korner QC

‘One thing that emerges from the injuries is that the level of violence you inflicted on your son was quite clearly escalating.

‘It is clear to me that you are an intelligent young man and because of that you could not have been unaware that you were hurting your son - on each occasion he would have cried.

‘There can be no greater position of trust than a parent left in charge of their young baby - and you abused that trust’.

Bennison had denied charges of grievous bodily harm in respect of the first attack, and grievous bodily harm with intent for the second.
