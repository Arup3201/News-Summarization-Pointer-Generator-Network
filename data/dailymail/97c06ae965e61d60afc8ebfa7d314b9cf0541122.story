High school students have walked out in protest after three female students were allegedly bullied off campus after being raped by a male teenager who then posted video of one attack on the Internet. 

The allegations have led to a police investigation and protests by students who say Oklahoma school officials have mishandled the case and subsequent bullying.

Hundreds of students, along with parents and supporters, filled the street Monday in front of Norman High School to protest what they say was bullying.

In a letter sent to parents, Principal Scott Beck acknowledged one alleged rape in September that took place off-campus, reports The Oklahoman.

But he refuted comments and allegations made on social media about the school's handling of the incident.

The walkout was organized through Facebook and Twitter accounts called 'YES ALL Daughters.'

The page has nearly 2,000 likes and the group organized a peaceful walkout on Monday.

Students and supporters were asked to wear blue or teal in support of anti-bullying and anti-rape efforts.

In all cases, the group claims three female students have been raped by the same male student and that all three were so severely bullied that they are unable to return to school.

A small group of students began a media campaign shortly after the alleged assaults, including Facebook and Twitter accounts called 'YES ALL Daughters'

Sophomore Danielle Brown said of the three girls: 'They're struggling. They're having a really tough time.'

'They want to come to school. They can't.'

Stacey Wright, Brown's aunt, told the website the bullying had been brutal.

'One of the girls, the very first day that she came back to school, didn't make it in the front doors before she was attacked by a mob of students who bullied her,' Wright said.

'After she was brave enough to come back after being raped.'

Jezebel.com has posted an audio recording of the male student allegedly bragging to another classmate about one of the attacks.

'She was, like, incoherent. Like, you could not talk to her at all … And I was just like, all right, get on your knees. And she did,' the voice says. 

One of the girls who claims she was raped, told the website she had attended a party and she was drinking and left at 10 pm to get a ride  home with the boy.

Norman Public Schools spokeswoman Shelly Hickman says administrators were made aware in September of a video of an alleged sexual assault and suspended the suspect

The students claim there was a failure by school administrators to take care of three girls who have accused a male classmate of sexually assaulting them

Norman Public Schools spokeswoman denied the district allowed any students to be bullied

But she said her last memory was arriving at a gas station near her house and not much else  until the following morning, when she awoke and felt 'sore'.

She said then she began to get messages accusing her of cheating on her boyfriend and she was sent a 10-second video of the alleged rape - Jezebel has not seen the video and cannot independently verify its existence.

She said she confronted the boy via text messages and went to the police and her mother took the recording to the school.

Cleveland County District Attorney Greg Mashburn confirmed Norman police are investigating alleged assaults of three girls. 

He said two reportedly happened off campus and the third happened at the school.
