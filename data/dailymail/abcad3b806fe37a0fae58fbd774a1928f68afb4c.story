Found dead: Charlie Denihan, 28, was found in his apartment on Sunday night

New reports claim that a hotel heir who was found dead in an apparent drug overdose was not alone when he died on Sunday.

Police were called to Charlie Denihan's apartment on the evening of March 16th and initial reports claimed that his roommate found him dead.

Now The New York Post says that a friend has disputed that version of events, saying that the 28-year-old son of the Denihan Hospitality Group founder does not have a roommate at all and a female model was the one who first found him dead.

The model, 23-year-old Sarah Walker, did not admit to being involved in the situation but did confirm that she knew 'Charlie'.

The unidentified friend said that he was the one who connected Denihan and Walker in the days leading up to his death.

'I introduced him to Sarah last week and she stuck around and we couldnâ€™t get rid of her,' the photographer friend claimed The Post.

'He said, "I like taming lions." She was with him all weekend. The last thing she said to me on Monday was that she woke up in his apartment and he was dead.'

Because the medical examiner's report has not been released yet, his official time of death is still unknown, which will help clarify the timeline of events.

When contacted by The Post, Walker, who works as both a model and actress, said that she would not be commenting 'out of respect for Charlie and his family'.

Was she there? An unnamed friend said that he introduced Denihan to 23-year-old model Sarah Walker and claimed that she told him she woke up in bed with him in his Union Square West apartment (right) to find him dead

Tragic: Police were called to Denihan's apartment at around 7.45pm

Denihan, a Cornell School of Hotel 
Administration graduate, was born and raised in Manhattan and had a 
history of working for start-ups in the city.

Accident: NYPD sources said that there is no criminal investigation open in connection to Denihan's death suggesting that foul play was not considered a factor

The
 Denihan Hospitality Group runs three luxury Manhattan hotels- The 
James, The Mansfield and The Surrey along with others across the 
country.

'I spent quite a 
few nights with Charlie and there is no way he was using GHB or meth,' a
 different friend said, according to The Post.

'He was a fun-loving guy who worked hard and partied hard. He was in great shape. This never should have happened.'

Calls to the medical examiner were not
 immediately returned but initial reports alleged that his death was 
believed to be the result of an accidental overdose.

Suspicions
 were raised because two other drug-related deaths were reported in a 
four-hour span that evening and the drug GHB was allegedly found at each
 scene.

The other two men 
who were found dead have been identified as 34-year-old Shaun Murphy and
 37-year-old Jovin Raithz and it is not known if the three men knew each
 other.

Though police were 
said to be investigating any questions, an NYPD spokesperson told 
MailOnline on Thursday that there were no criminal investigations open 
in relation to his death, which there would be if there were any 
connection between the three deaths.

Social: A friend (not pictured) said that the GHB found at Denihan's apartment was not Charlie's and while the Cornell grad partied hard he did work hard as well

Denihan's family released a statement after his death asking for privacy and an obituary was published in The New York Times on Wednesday.

'Although the youngest of four siblings, Charlie had an extraordinary bond with his slightly older, special needs brother Tully, and was a 'big' brother to him from the moment he was born,' the obituary read.

'Those who met Charlie consistently walked away moved by his presence, knowing well that he was a friend who would always be there when it really counted.'

A wake will be held for him at the Frank Campbell Funeral Home on the Upper East Side- which is where Jackie Kennedy, Heath Ledger and Phillip Seymour Hoffman's services were arranged- on Friday and that will be followed by his funeral on Saturday at St Ignatius of Loyola.
