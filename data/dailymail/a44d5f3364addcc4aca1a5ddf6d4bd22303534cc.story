Jurgen Klinsmann believes he was right to claim that America were not ready to win the World Cup because the USA coach did not want to over-hype expectations.

The German insists he did not want to talk up his team so much that they would head to the tournament with 'expectations to kind of a level that is over the moon.'

America were eliminated in the round of 16 for the second straight tournament, losing to Belgium 2-1 in extra time on Tuesday.

Klinsmann believes the record audience
 that tuned in at will help pressure players to improve and will create 
competition for positions.

In
 his wrap-up news conference Wednesday, he said: 'If you have a bad 
performance, then people should approach you and tell you that, so make 
sure that next game is not bad anymore and that you step it up.'

He added: 'We can only grow. Our upside is far bigger than some other countries. You just have to make it grow.

'All
 of the games of the World Cup were received back at home. Thousands of 
people more watched than four years ago in South Africa.'

Growing: Football is at an all-time high in the United States following their World Cup performance

Patriotic: American fans flocked to public screening areas across the USA

As
 veterans of the international scene Clint Dempsey, Tim Howard and 
DaMarcus Beasley battled away at the Arena Fonte Nova, America's bright 
young things were busy putting forward their country's case as serious 
contenders for Russia in four years' time.

Julian
 Green, only 19-years-old and making his first appearance in Brazil, 
scored with his opening touch to set up a dramatic finish against Marc 
Wilmots' much-fancied side.

And
 although Klinsmann's men couldn't beat Thibaut Courtois again to force a
 penalty shootout, they deserve to leave South America with both pride 
and hope for the future.

The
 impact of the young Bayern Munich forward, who controlled Michael 
Bradley's pinpoint pass with a brilliant first-time volley to reduce his
 side's two-goal deficit, gave supporters a glimpse of the country's 
emerging talent.

With 
talisman Dempsey now 31 and the international career of record 
goalscorer Landon Donovan seemingly over, Green will be expected to 
become a major part of Team USA's attacking force. The early signs 
suggest he's ready to do just that.

Born
 in Florida to an American father and a German mother, the versatile 
forward was picked up by the Bundesliga giants Bayern in 2010 and made 
his first team debut as a late substitute in a Champions League tie 
against CSKA Moscow last November.

He
 represented Germany at various youth levels before being talked into 
swapping allegiances by Klinsmann, who has focused on convincing a 
number of players with dual nationality to start wearing the famous 
stars and stripes.
