A teenage boy hitched a lift home from school by riding on the tailbar of a 40 tonne lorry in a dangerous stunt that 'could have killed him'.

Police said they were trying to track down the schoolboy responsible and said the stunt was 'extremely dangerous and reckless'.

The schoolboy - who nonchalantly gave the thumbs up after leaping off the back of the truck - was today condemned by road safety officials for the prank which was caught on camera.

The child, thought to be aged around 14, is wearing his blue school blazer, as he foolishly jumps on the back of the lorry in Blackburn, Lancashire.

Dangerous: Sonny Wilson rides on the tailbar of the lorry in a terrifying stunt which was filmed and posted on Facebook

Terrifying: Sonny Wilson didn't expect the lorry to drive off when he jumped on the back

The driver set off completely 
unaware that a child was hanging off the back of his vehicle and at risk of serious harm.

Footage of the incident was captured by a
front seat passenger in a car travelling behind and the 52-second clip was posted on Facebook.

The lorry driver negotiated a major road junction before travelling up hill along a busy road for around half a mile as the boy sat on the tailgate seemingly admiring the view.

Eventually when the TNT delivery lorry slowed down at traffic lights the boy jumped off and gave the occupants of the car behind a cheeky thumbs up before walking off down the street.

Danger: As the vehicle climbs uphill on the main road through Blackburn, the boy continues to cling to the back

Risk: The lorry makes its way past parked cars with other vehicles and a bus passing in the opposite direction

Horror: A lorry passes in the opposite direction, left, and the boy then shortly afterwards jumps off, right

The road which has small shops and terrace houses is one of Blackburn's busiest approaches, leading towards the M65 and towns including Accrington and Burnley.

Today Kevin Clinton, head of road safety at the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents said: 'This is a dangerous and foolish act which could easily result in serious injury or death.

'We urge teenagers not to give into peer pressure or to encourage others to copy this behaviour.'

The group who filmed the video can be heard shouting: 'What's he doing the crazy little f*****?'

Calm: The boy wanders off after jumping off the lorry as if nothing untoward had happened

They then add: 'Are you filming it? He must be s****** himself. Look at him. What the f*** is he doing?'

The lorry passes a bus, as well as rows of parked cars as he travels at up to 30mph on the street.

The clip with the title 'Only in Blackburn ya find a little kid like this couldn't believe it funny as f***' has now been shared thousands of times on the social media website.

Suzanne Sourbutts said: 'Silly boy, if that wagon had to brake suddenly God knows what might have happened.'

Pauline Emmerson added: 'What if he'd fallen, not so funny if he'd landed underneath a car.'

Andrew Tony posted a message saying: 'Saved himself 40p bus fare there..... Bit crazy tho...'

Councillor Jim Shorrock said it could have led to 'devastating consequences' and he called for local head teachers to tackle the to 'prevent it becoming a craze'.

He added: 'I also hope other young people across Blackburn are not thinking of doing anything so stupid.'

Lancashire police said they are aware of the footage and were making inquiries to trace the boy in the video.

Inspector Gareth Hill, head of the Road Policing Unit, said: 'What this young boy did is extremely dangerous and reckless.

'It is a potentially life threatening practice that we would not support or encourage.

Pleased with himself: The boy walks off after completing his ride through the town which was condemned by road safety experts

'We know the route this vehicle took and we will now be making inquiries to ascertain who this young man was.

'All those sharing this reckless 
incident on social networking sites such as Facebook are acting 
inappropriately, almost encouraging other young people to do the same 
thing.

'I now plan to visit schools in the area to explain the dangers involved in behaviour like this.
'I appeal for anyone who recognises this young man to come forward and contact police.'

A TNT Express spokesman said: 'TNT 
Express is aware of video footage on social media channels which shows a
young schoolboy riding on the rear bumper of one of its vehicles.

'TNT does not condone such dangerous and illegal behaviour which could lead to serious injury or worse.

'We take such matters very seriously and are doing everything possible to help police with their investigations.'

Delight: The boy gives the thumbs up to the people filming in the car behind as he walks off
