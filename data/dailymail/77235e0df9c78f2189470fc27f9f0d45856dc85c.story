Kim Richards' pitbull terrier Kingsley savaged her niece Alexia so badly that the teen was left needing surgery.

The attack on the 18-year-old saw the dog bite her multiple times, with the most severe wound ripping through the flesh on her hand to reach the bone in her thumb. She is understood to have required two different surgeries.

The dog, which has a history of biting, currently remains at Real Housewives Of Beverly Hills star Kim's home.

Devoted mother: Kyle Richards sleeps over at Cedars Sinai hospital on Monday as her daughter Alexa is treated after being attacked by her aunt Kim's dog Kingsley in LA

According to website TMZ Kingsley went for Alexia during a family gathering, early on Saturday morning at Kim's house.

A group including Alexia's mother Kyle were at the home on Halloween, and had been near the dog without incident  when it 'went into attack mode out of nowhere'.

But according to an update by TMZ Kim now claims to have warned her niece not to go into the room her dog was being kept in and that she warns every house guest that Kingsley 'should not be bothered'.

'The second I realized Alexia had been bitten on the finger leaving a puncture mark on her thumb,' Kim said, 'I immediately called my sister Kyle and took her to the nearest emergency room.'

The wound however was reportedly more than just a puncture, but a gash to the bone requiring two surgeries.

Kim went on to discuss the fate of the dog: 'At this point I am looking at options to what the next step is for Kingsley. As many of you can relate, he is my best friend. This is a very difficult decision and time for all of us, but the safety of my family always comes first.'

The animal has previously featured in the plotline of RHOBH where it was seen being very aggressive towards other dogs.

Aggressive: The animal previously bit a trainer hired to domesticate it

Incident: A group  had been at the home for a family celebration, when the dog 'went into attack mode'

After Kim sought  help controlling the dog, it bit the trainer she hired, one of four known biting incidents.

Back in March the dog savaged a friend of Kim's while she was sat on her bed chatting to the star. 

The bite went through to the woman's bone in her arm and paramedics were called.

A further incident occurred when an unknown victim was bitten this summer.

Following that attack LA's department of Animal Control Services did visit the home to assess the dog, but the animal was left in Kim's care.

However as the latest attack was not reported to authorities, Kingsley remains at mother-of-four Kim's home.

Unless a victim or member of their family contacts the ACS then no action will be taken. If a report is made an assessment will take place to decide if the animal is under control in Kim's care.

ACS visited the star's home over the summer after it attacked another visitor, but at the time Kim was only given a warning. 

David Utter, who originally trained the pitbull, has also given a statement regarding the dog to TMZ. He claims the dog should be muzzled at all time and now that the dog has attacked four people direct and immediate action should be taken.

Utter says the Kingsley should be immediately taken away from Kim. 

Kim's sister Kyle, mother to Alexia, has previously commented that she felt 'nervous' about Kingsley's behaviour.

On an reunion episode of RHOBH earlier this year, Andy Cohen was seen reading a comment from a fan that stated: 'Kim I worry that I'm going to pick up that paper one day and read about your dog having eaten you.'

Kyle admitted: 'I do worry a little bit to be honest. You hear these stories and I think oh my gosh. 

'When she [Kim] doesn't answer her phone or a text I tell her " I get worried that the dog maybe did something".'

Taking to her Instagram account, Kyle shared with 616,529 followers: 'Regarding Alexia: She was attacked by a dog and has to have surgery

Her philosophy: Kyle posted this inspirational message about her experience 

And she said the attack on the trainer was a warning sign for her.

'I got nervous, just because of the stories I've heard. Nothing from what I seen, he's always sweet.'

Kyle slept over at Cedars Sinai hospital in LA on Monday night, while Alexia underwent the first of two surgeries.

Taking to her Instagram account, Kyle shared with 616,529 followers: 'Regarding Alexia: She was attacked by a dog and has to have surgery. 

'As always, she is trying to make the best out of a bad situation .Thank you for your thoughts & well wishes'. 

The mother-of-four had earlier posted pictures of her daughter on a hospital bed with her family and friends around her.

'Slumber party at Cedars Sinai Hospital with @alexiaumansky @farrahbritt @sophiakylieee,' she wrote posing with her daughters.

Pointing the finger: The squabbling sisters had an infamous showdown in the back of a limousine where Kyle accused her sister of being an alcoholic

While Kim and Kyle have been on better terms in recent years, the dog attack is bound to place a strain on their fiery relationship, which has been an ongoing storyline on The Real Housewives Of Beverly Hills over the years.

The finale of the first season in 2010 saw tensions coming to a head between the pair, with Kim's erratic behaviour and constant slurring of words leading her sister to surmise she had a substance abuse problem.

The squabbling sisters had a dramatic showdown in the back of a limousine, with Kyle branding her sister an alcohol and threatening to withdraw financial aid she and husband Mauricio Umansky gave to her.

Kim briefly entered rehab in December 2011, and later admitted that she was an alcoholic in an interview with Housewives mastermind Andy Cohen.

Speaking about her sister's admission at the time, Kyle told Good Morning America: 'I'm proud to hear her say that. I'm proud of her. I know that's the biggest step in recovery, to admit that.'

She went on: 'There were things going on that the audience wasn’t aware of. I had had a lot of pain and built up anger and frustration towards [Kim], and obviously she did towards me too. It was a vicious cycle.

'It was very difficult to have people dissect and analyse your relationship thinking they know you from a TV show when it’s been a long time in the making.'

Kim, a former child Disney star, now says she is sober, which has been documented over the last couple of seasons of the reality show.
