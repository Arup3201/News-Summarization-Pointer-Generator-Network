A British-bound plane from Pakistan has been forced into an emergency landing in Istanbul after a bomb was reported on the aircraft.

The plane, which was bound for Manchester, received the bomb threat while in the air over Bulgaria and was forced to change direction.

The Pakistan International Airlines flight flew back towards Istanbul and landed at the Turkish city's International Ataturk Airport today.

Within minutes of the UK-bound plane 
being grounded, PIA officials also confirmed that a second plane from 
Islamabad had received a bomb threat.

PIA spokesman Mashood Tajwar said a second PIA flight from Islamabad to Kuala Lumpur also received a bomb threat today.

It landed in Kuala Lumpur and all 176 passengers disembarked safely.

Authorities quickly evacuated all 378 passengers from the Britain-bound Boeing 777-300ER aircraft after it was parked at a remote corner of the International Ataturk Airport.

Bomb squads began searching the plane with sniffer dogs, according to the Turkish state-run Anatolia news agency.

The plane received the threat somewhere near the Bulgarian capital of Sofia, and contacted the control tower in Istanbul to seek permission for the landing.

According to Pakistani newspaper the International Herald Tribune, a female passenger received a threat about a bomb being on board.

Television footage showed the PIA 
plane with the Pakistani flag painted on its tail on the tarmac in 
Istanbul with about a dozen ground workers nearby apparently after the 
plane was evacuated.

Firefighter trucks and ambulances were on standby at a safe distance.
