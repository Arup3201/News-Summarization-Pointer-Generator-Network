Lets hope the real event is a little bit more exciting and attracts bigger crowd.

A full dress rehearsal for the London 2012 Olympics torch relay got under way today - but only handfuls of people turned out to watch the spectacle and there wasn't even a flame on the torch.

Some 122 participants from Leicestershire were acting as torchbearers during the only full operational dummy run of a single day of the relay.

The actual torch relay will start from Land's End in Cornwall next month after the arrival of the Olympic flame in the UK on May 18.

Today's rehearsal, taking place on the Leicester to Peterborough route, is aimed at testing timings, convoy movement, radio communications, traffic management and security.

The torch will not be lit during the rehearsal, the organisers said.

The actual Olympic flame will pass through 1,018 places in the UK, as well as visiting Dublin, arriving in London for the Olympic Games opening ceremony on July 27.

Today's rehearsal kicked off at the National Space Centre in Leicester just after 7am.

Each of the participants, who have been chosen from the local area to take part in today's rehearsal, will carry the torch some 300m.

The participants are volunteers from local universities and organisations, but will not be taking part in the actual event.

The Olympic Flame is due to pass along the route on day 46 of the torch relay.

Speaking ahead of today's rehearsal, David Chaplain, a Loughborough University student, said he was excited to be taking part as one of the acting torchbearers.

The 20-year-old, who is in his second year of a sports management degree, said 'I would have liked to have been involved in the real thing but I wasn't sure I was going to be in the country. This is a great opportunity to still be involved.

'It's something you take forward with you for the rest of your life.'

Another student, Kayleigh Pettit, 23, who is in her final year of a physics degree at the university, said she had been nervous about dropping the torch.

'I was initially quite worried about it because of how heavy the torch was going to be and anyone I mentioned it to said 'Oh what if you dropped it', but now I've had chance to hold it, it's actually very light and easy to hold.'

Sebastian Coe, chairman of the London Organising Committee for the Olympic Games, spoke to some of the participants taking part in today's rehearsal during a handover at Loughborough University.

Lord Coe, who represented the university during his time studying economics and social history there, said the day would help to ensure they were 'as close to perfection' as possible for the actual event.

The Olympic gold medal-winning athlete said: 'We've got different modes of transport. We've got the torch travelling on a boat, we've got it travelling by train, we've obviously got the torchbearers themselves.

Even at Loughborough University there was a lack of people on the side of the route

'It was just a good way of testing it. It's like 122 mini dress rehearsals involving 12 different communities and 80 miles.

'We'll collate all the learnings of the course of the day and take them back to HQ and look at it all. This is no different from every other aspect of the Games we're testing.

'We're into 400,000 hours of technology testing, we've got 11 test events still left to do in sport.

'I've sat on the kerbstones of roads at 5.45 in the morning talking to marathon runners about the test event for the marathon.

'We just learn and refine so that we can get as close to perfection as we possibly can.'

When asked about security concerns, Lord Coe said he was confident people were looking to celebrate rather than disrupt the relay.

He said: 'You can hear the music and the excitement in the background. This is a celebration. I'm just delighted that we've got the opportunity to take the torch to within 10 miles of 57 million people.

'I don't believe that there is any appetite to do anything other than really want to celebrate the torch relay.'

From the university, the rehearsal team was due to travel through Melton Mowbray, Langham and Oakham in Rutland.

At Rutland Water, a torchbearer will be carried across the water on a rigid inflatable boat (RIB) to hand over the torch to a participant on another boat.

From there, the party will travel on to Uppingham and Stamford before torchbearers board another steam train on the Nene Valley Railway to Orton Mere station to end the day in Peterborough.
