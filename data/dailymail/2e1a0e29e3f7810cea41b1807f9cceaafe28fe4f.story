With the World Cup's other posterboys - Neymar and Lionel Messi - both impressing in their opening games, it was the turn of the world's current best player Cristiano Ronaldo to strut his stuff in Brazil.

Sadly, Portugal didn't read the script involving a goalscoring return that saw Ronaldo carry his side to improbable victory - as they were humbled 4-0 by Germany at the Arena Fonte Nova.

A red card in the first-half for Pepe didn't help Portugal's cause and, while the captain tried in vain to influence the outcome, Ronaldo was generally chasing a lost cause. The only consolation being that he lasted the full 90minutes following recent injury concerns.

There were serious doubts over Ronaldo's
 fitness ahead of the game, which saw the Real Madrid forward miss two 
warm-up friendlies and limp out of training on Thursday with a 
recurrence of the tendinitis trouble he has been suffering since the 
Champions League final.

16.50: The great man's name is mentioned for the first time as his selection on the left side of Portugal's front three is confirmed. And, it doesn't take long before the inevitable comparisons between football's greatest rivals are brought up by Adrian Chiles.

For the record, both Patrick Vieira and Lee Dixon would have 'The Machine' Ronaldo in their side while Fabio Cannavaro chose the more mercurial talents of Lionel Messi.

16:55 Ronaldo appears as pristinely groomed as ever, especially in the company of hirsute teammate Raul Miereles, as Portugal's jaunty national anthem is played ahead of the game in Salvador.

0-4mins: After Germany start strongly, it's several minutes before Ronaldo gets his first touch of the Brazuca. But, any fears over his fitness seem to have been allayed by a trademark burst of pace takes him past the German defence to set up striker Hugo Almeida for Portugal's first chance.

7mins: A mistake by Philipp Lahm allows Miguel Veloso to steal the ball and feed Ronaldo on the edge of the box. Passing, of course, is never an option and Ronaldo hits a low drilled shot that is easily collected by Manuel Neuer - forcing him to apologise to his teammates.

10mins: Germany 1-0 Portugal Thomas Muller deservedly opens the scoring from the penalty spot after Portugal defender Joao Pereria is fortunate not to be dismissed for bundling Mario Gotze over in the box.

22mins: With Portugal already chasing the game and Germany looking comfortable in possession, Ronaldo is aggressively bundled off the ball by Jerome Boateng. It's the sort of tackle that would have left the young Ronaldo still rolling but he's quickly on his feet without complaint.

31mins: Germany 2-0 Portugal Germany are in total control of the game and, despite playing some beautiful possession football, their second goal comes from a set piece when a corner is met by a bullet header from Manchester United target Mats Hummels. It is going to take an individual effort of Sweden proportions for Ronaldo to change the course of this game.

34mins: The flaws in Portugal's plan of trying to find Ronaldo during practically every attack are exposed when both Nani and then Fabio Coentrao waste opportunities by trying to pass to their talisman when both were in superb positions to shoot.

36mins: Red card - Portugal Portugal's combustible defender Pepe is given an almost customary red card (13 and counting!) for first bringing down Muller and then reacting to the German's histrionics with a pressing forehead. The mountain Ronaldo needs to climb just got steeper.

45mins: Germany 3-0 Portugal Muller takes advantage of Portugal's dwindling numbers when a poor clearance falls to the German false No 9 who smashes home to send his side into the interval three goals ahead.

46mins: Ronaldo starts the second half amid suggestions that he might be rested for games that Portugal still have a chance of winning. At 3-0 and a man down, Ronaldo's World Cup opener could be reduced to an opportunity to recover his match fitness and perhaps score a consolation goal.

51mins: Portugal manage a rare foray forward and Ronaldo threads a nets pass into the area only for a lack of communication between his teammates leads to Nani stealing the ball from Coentrao before it rolls out of play.

59mins: Ronaldo wins a free-kick from distance and takes up his traditional wide stance before thumping into the German wall as he fails to add to his tally of two World Cup goals - scored against Iran (2006) and North Korea (2010).

65mins: Expectations are briefly raised from Portugal fans as Ronaldo picks up the ball and races forward. But, with his options limited by Pepe's sending off, he elects for an optimistic long drive that is blocked by Hummels.

74mins: Ronaldo goes ballistic after Portugal are denied what appears a bonafide penalty after Eder is brought down in the box chasing a blocked effort from Nani. The severity of Ronaldo's protestations suggest he is more concerned about getting his name on the scoresheet than the overall score.

77mins: German 4-0 Portugal Only moments later, the leading scorer at the 2010 World Cup, Muller completes his hat-trick with a simple tap-in from close range on his 50th international appearance

83mins: Ronaldo is still racing around the pitch as the game enters its final 10 minutes, allaying any fears over his fitness - but a second free-kick of the afternoon is aimed in the same place as the first, somehow managing to hit Lahm in a one-man German wall.

91mins: Ronaldo's final contribution to the evening is another free-kick. This time he clears the ball with a thunderous effort that forces Neuer to make an excellent save and deny Ronaldo even a small moment of personal glory.

With Pepe likely to miss the rest of the group stage and worrying injuries to the likes of Almeida and Coentrao, Portugal face a daunting task to qualify from a group that also contains Ghana and the USA whether Ronaldo is firing on all cylinders or not. Germany, meanwhile, look awesome.
