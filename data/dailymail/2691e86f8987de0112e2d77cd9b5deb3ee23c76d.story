Turkish Airlines are understood to be top of the list to replace Samsung, whose contract as Chelsea shirt sponsors expires at the end of the season.

Europe's fourth biggest airliner, who made a memorable commercial deal with sports stars Lionel Messi and Kobe Bryant, have recently been sponsors of Barcelona, Manchester United and the Turkey national team.

Partnership: Chelsea's agreement with kit sponsors Samsung ends at end of the season

Samsung have backed Chelsea since 2005 when former chief executive Peter Kenyon said the club was going to ‘paint the world blue’. 

Chelsea renewed their shirt sponsorship contract with Samsung in 2013, but with surprisingly little publicity.

Lucrative: Turkish Airlines have been a sponsor of Spanish giants Barcelona

The deal is understood to be worth around £18million a year but the Korean electronic giants waited until after Chelsea’s Champions League triumph before agreeing the contract on the deadline for taking up the option.

Chelsea explained the strange lack of promotion by saying it is an extension rather than the announcement of a new partnership.

Spreading their wings: Turkish Airlines linked up with Manchester United

Chelsea agreed a 10-year kit contract worth £300million with adidas last summer. 

However, the numbers show just how far Chelsea are behind Manchester United on the commercial front. 

The Old Trafford kit sponsorship contract with Chevrolet, which the club trumpeted two years ahead of its start in 2014-15, is worth over £50m a season.
