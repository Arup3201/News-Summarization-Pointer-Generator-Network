Leonardo DiCaprio's niece has been kidnapped by a member of her family, police revealed after arresting her father on drug-related charges in Texas.

Normadie Farrar, six, who was last seen on Saturday, last week, has now been declared abducted as authorities try to establish where she is.

Her father Adam Farrar, who is DiCaprio's oldest sibling, is accused of concealing the missing child, according to Los Angeles Police Department.

He was reportedly detained in Collin County Friday on 'two Class A Misdemeanors...for possession of a dangerous drug and theft', reports RadarOnline.

According to the website, both charges were outstanding warrants issued in Los Angeles. He was also reportedly charged with phone harassment.

If convicted, the 43-year-old faces a lengthy prison sentence, reports Radar.

Farrar's girlfriend Charity Moore, 38, was also arrested nearly a week before him on a slew of charges, including two counts of possession of a dangerous drug, theft and a misdemeanor involving a parent contributing to the child's failure to attend school, according to her Collin County Jail arrest record.

The couple are apparently both still being held at the correctional facility, a spokesman for the sheriff's office told MailOnline.

A source told Radar: 'Adam and Charity have been hiding with Normadie in Texas, away from the Los Angeles County Department of Children and Family Service, who have long been involved in their cases due to their criminal pasts.

'They had been staying in North Dallas. Now, no-one in the family is sure where their daughter is, at this time.'

DiCaprio and Farrar used to be close and 
the pair were seen attending Los Angeles Lakers games together and hitting 
the Hollywood party scene – although in recent years it’s thought their 
relationship has turned sour. 

Sources told RadarOnline that Farrar 
and his Oscar nominee step-brother 'have had zero contact in recent 
years and do not get along.'

It is widely reported that DiCaprio was inspired to go into acting after he saw his step-brother carve a career for himself in commercials, movies and TV in the 1980s.

Farrar is best known for his roles in the science fiction series Battlestar Galactica and the ABC comedy-drama Eight is Enough.

However,
 as DiCaprio's career took off in the late 90s and Farrar's came to a standstill, things
 ended up rather differently for the brothers, who grew up together in 
LA after DiCaprio's mother, Peggy, married Farrar's father, cartoonist George DiCaprio, when he was 
just one.

Since
 2010, Farrar has been in and out of courts on charges of harassment, 
possession of controlled substances, driving without a license and 
domestic violence.

In 2000, as DiCaprio was riding the success of his blockbuster Titanic, Farrar was arrested on charges that he attempted to kill his then-girlfriend and made terroristic threats.

At the time, Peggy DiCaprio said of her troubled stepson: 'Adam is one of the most nonviolent people I know,’ according to New York Daily News.

Farrar was released within 48 hours of his March 2000 arrest, and the charges against him were eventually dropped.

People Magazine reported that two years earlier, the struggling actor landed in trouble with the law after allegedly assaulting a photographer who was pursuing his superstar sibling. Charges were never filed in that case.
