British detectives have interviewed a second woman in Australia in connection with sex abuse claims against Rolf Harris.

She claims the entertainer sexually assaulted her when she was a teenager living in the UK.

The woman, who now lives in Wollongong, near Sydney, was quizzed by officers from Operation Yewtree, set up last year to investigate the Jimmy Savile sex scandal.

Earlier this month another woman, 
Lauren Martell, was interviewed at her home in Wiseman’s Ferry, north of
 Sydney, by Scotland Yard officers. The 43-year-old mother of two says 
she is a witness to an alleged ‘incident’, rather than a victim.

Harris, 83, was arrested in March and 
has been interviewed twice in Britain. No charges have been brought and 
he has strenuously denied any wrongdoing.

He was arrested after a woman told 
police she was sexually assaulted by him when she was a teenager. 
Harris, a favourite of the Queen, is the biggest name to be arrested so 
far by Yewtree officers.

Lauren Martell, pictured emerging from her home, told police of an alleged 'incident' involving Mr Harris at a London recording studio more than 20 years ago

Inquiry: Mrs Martell said later that the detectives had told her they were interviewing other people in Australia

The artist, singer and children’s 
entertainer was first interviewed under caution over alleged sexual 
offences on November 29 after attending a police station by appointment.

Five days earlier, officers searched 
his home in Bray, Berkshire, while he was out of the country and took 
away computer equipment and other items.

On March 28, police decided to 
formally arrest him over the allegations, although the news did not 
become public until late last month.

The allegations are not linked to the Savile inquiry.

Yesterday friends of Harris broke 
their silence to defend him, saying the claims against him are ‘utter 
rubbish’. Musician Dana Gillespie, who has worked with Harris, said: 
‘I’m amazed that Scotland Yard are wasting their time to do this. He’s 
the cleanest living man, the most un-rock’n’roll.’

Harris’s friend and producer Steve Lima said the allegations were ‘completely without foundation’.

He said the entertainer had ‘aged ten 
years in the last six months’ and was ‘fearful that he might take his 
life’. Mr Lima added: ‘I can assure you, as his pal, he has no interest 
in children.’

Following the questioning of
Lauren Martell, who lives at Wiseman's Ferry, north of Sydney, a 
fortnight ago, two detectives travelled to the city of 
Wollongong, 100 miles south of Sydney, to interview a second woman

Harris, who has lived in the UK for  
more than 50 years and is married to Welsh sculptress and jeweller Alwen
 Hughes, has not issued any formal statements over the allegations, but 
denies any wrongdoing. He met his wife when both were art students in 
London. They married in March 1958 and have one daughter, Bindi, an 
artist.

At last summer’s Diamond Jubilee 
concert at Buckingham Palace, Harris led the crowd in an impromptu 
rendition of Two Little Boys, his 1969 Christmas No 1 hit. His other 
hits include Tie Me Kangaroo Down Sport.

His detention follows the arrests of 
pop star Gary Glitter, comedian Freddie Starr, DJ Dave Lee Travis, 
publicist Max Clifford and comedian Jim Davidson.

Starr, Travis, Clifford and Davidson 
publicly denied any wrongdoing and gave statements after their arrests.

Clifford was charged last month with 11 indecent assaults on girls and 
young women, including a 14-year-old.
