A military couple whose engagement ring was secretly bought by actor Paul Walker came forward today after finally having their suspicions confirmed that the star was behind the act of amazing generosity.

Soldier Kyle Upham and his new wife Kristen were in a Santa Barbara jewellery store in 2004 looking for a diamond ring shortly before he was sent on his second deployment back to Iraq.

The couple quickly realized that the other shopper in the store was Fast And The Furious star Walker and struck up a conversation. Kyle revealed to the actor that he had just come back from a tour of duty in Iraq.

Paul Walker's secret act of generosity - buying a $9,000 engagement ring for an Iraq war veteran and his new wife - was revealed by the jewellery store following the star's tragic death

Kristen Upham told CBS today: 'When he found out Kyle just came back 
from Iraq - I remember seeing the look in his face. He 
kind of transformed.'

The couple, from Victorville, ultimately left the store without a ring - after they decided they could not afford the $9,000 diamond band that Mrs Upham had set her heart on.

A short time later, a sales assistant called the couple and told them to return to the store - where they were presented with the ring. 

Walker had sought out the manager of the store and told him to put the ring 'on his tab'.

When they astounded couple asked who bought it for them, the clerks refused to say - at Walker's request.

The Uphams kept the gift receipt and often suspected it had been the star but could never be certain.

The store, which has since closed its Santa Barbara outlet,
 kept Walker's secret but after the 40-year-old's tragic death in a car 
crash on Saturday, employee Irene King felt the world should know the actor's true 
character.

Mrs Upham said Walker's gesture remains the kindness thing anyone had ever done for her.

She added: 'His real life speaks volumes of his character. He really did put his money where his mouth is and did good for this world.'

Kyle Upham, from Victorville, California, served two tours of duty in Iraq. He married wife Kristen in 2004

The actor overheard the couple saying that they couldn't afford the ring, so he anonymously purchased it for them instead

The Fast And The Furious star has been mourned by family, friends, co-stars and fans who laid a shrine to the star at the spot where he died in Santa Clarita on Saturday afternoon.

The 2005 Porsche Carrera GT was being driven by the Hollywood star's friend and business partner Roger Rodas when it crashed in Los Angeles, killing both of them.

On Monday, Walker's Fast & Furious co-star Vin Diesel joined crowds who'd gathered to pay their respects.

Speaking through a police car loudspeaker, he said: 'If my brother were here right now and saw all the love that you're bringing here. If he could see for himself that all of you have showed up to show my brother love at this hard time. That his family gets to see all of you show the love that you've shown Paul. It's going to stay with me forever.

'I just wanted to say thank you. Thank you for coming down here and showing that angel up in heaven how much you appreciate him. It's going to stay with me for ever.'
