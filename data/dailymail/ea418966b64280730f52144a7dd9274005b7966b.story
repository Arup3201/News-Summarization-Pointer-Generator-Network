The victims of a Russian helicopter crash that killed 12 in an Arctic lake were preparing a fishing trip for president Vladimir Putin, it has been reported.

The Mi-8 helicopter broke into three 
pieces after smashing into the Munozera lake in the northwestern 
Murmansk region in bad weather on Saturday evening, emergency officials 
said.

And today, an unidentified regional official told local Flash Nord news agency that the expedition was preparing a fishing trip for Putin, who had been expected to arrive in Murmansk 'in the coming days'. The report could not be independently confirmed.

Sinking: The Mi-8 helicopter carrying 17 passengers and crew including top regional officials and businessmen, came down into the Munozero lake in the far northern Murmansk region on Saturday. Two survived the crash

Icy depths: Investigators said that possible causes of the crash were aircraft malfunction and bad weather conditions

Putin is known to enjoy recreational fishing in the Arctic, and told the U.S. Outdoor Life magazine in 2011 that some of the 'best fishing in the world' was in the Murmansk region.

He has repeatedly posed for photographs with a rod in his hand and has, on more than one occasion, done so without a shirt on in a series of topless displays of manhood for which he has become known.

The helicopter belonged to the 
fertilizer producer Apatit, whose top executives were onboard along with
 regional government officials, according to the parent company, 
PhosAgro. The company published a list of 13 passengers and five crew 
members believed to have been on the flight.

Reacting to today's report, however, PhosAgro general director Andrei Guryev 
said in a statement that the purpose of the trip was not a recce ahead of Putin's visit but to look at the 
potential for developing tourism in the Murmansk region and to 
familiarize officials with the tourism infrastructure owned by Apatit.

Two passengers survived the crash while three more remain missing.

The cause of the crash was still under investigation, but was most likely due either to technical failure or the pilotâ€™s inability to handle difficult weather conditions, the spokesman for the federal Investigative Committee, Vladimir Markin, said in a statement.

'There were 17 people on board. The bodies of 12 dead have been raised to the surface, the fate of three people remains unknown,' the head of the emergency ministry's national crisis management centre, Viktor Yatsutsenko, was quoted as saying by the ITAR-TASS news agency.

The two survivors were in a 'satisfactory condition' in hospital after being found floating in the lake still strapped to their chairs, Yatsutsenko said.

Ten out of the 12 dead have been identified, including the deputy governor of the Murmansk region, Sergei Skomorokhov, the RIA Novosti news agency reported, citing a law enforcement source.

Searching: Three people are still missing as hope of finding survivors began to fade

The search for the missing was hampered by poor weather conditions with high winds and waves, rescuers told RIA Novosti.

The number of people on board was initially reported as 18, but fell to 17 as it emerged that one crew member did not board the helicopter.

'According to updated data, one of the crew members, a technician... did not fly,' a source from law enforcement told ITAR-TASS.

Investigators said that possible causes of the crash were aircraft malfunction and bad weather conditions.

'The pilot found himself in difficult meteorological conditions, lost his sense of direction and hit the surface of the water,' the Investigative Committee said in a statement.

PhosAgro, one of the world's top producers of phosphate fertilizers, said that the trip was organized by one of its subsidiaries to help regional authorities to develop the region's tourism potential and attract investors.
