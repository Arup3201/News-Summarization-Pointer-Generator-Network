The incredible sounds of an ice‘cracking’ and crashing down into water as an iceberg have been recorded by scientists.

In a video, the moment a chunk of ice splits apart from a larger glacier is watched live by a camera and underwater recording equipment.

By studying the noises, the team say it will be possible to detect the different ways that glaciers lose ice  into the oceans. 

Scientists have recorded the sounds of icebergs crashing into the sea (still image from video shown). The recordings were made at the Hans Glacier in Svalbard, Norway. They used underwater microphones aboard buoys to get the sounds. In a video the 'cracking' of ice is heard before a chunk crashes down

The scientists used underwater microphones aboard buoys to record a variety of iceberg births at the Hans Glacier in Svalbard, Norway during three days in August 2013.

The recordings were then combined with time-lapse photos of the glacier during the same period.

By synchronising the sound recordings with the photographs, the researchers discovered that different types of ice loss are associated with distinct rumbles, snaps and splashes.

Salt water is much denser than fresh water, causing icebergs to float.

As they melt in the ocean, their weight distribution can change, causing some icebergs to flip over completely.

However, this is an extremely rare occurrence as 90 per cent of any iceberg is below the surface, meaning the balance is rarely in favour of a complete flip.

When a flip does occur, the consequences can be devastating. For instance, larger iceberg flips can trigger tsunamis that can damage nearby ships. 

Their research is to be published in the journal Geophysical Research Letters.

The scientists identified acoustic signatures for three different ways that ice breaks away from a glacier, or calves.

An ice chunk falls off the leading face of the glacier into the water below. Then an ice fragment cracks away from that face and slides down it into the water.

Or, alternatively, an underwater ice block detaches from the face beneath the water, then pops up to the sea surface.

The newly reported findings may give scientists a better understanding of how glaciers lose ice, the study’s authors write, even when icebergs detach underwater - a difficult-to-observe phenomenon.

If inexpensive acoustic methods could be used to gain insight into various calving events, they add, that could be important as glaciers around the world continue to crumble and contribute to global sea level rise.
