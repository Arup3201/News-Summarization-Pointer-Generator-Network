Hillary Clinton already has a running mate for 2016 in mind, according to several news sources.

Clinton is reportedly eying Incoming Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro for the role of vice president should she run again and is keeping the former San Antonio, Texas, mayor and his twin brother, Rep. Joaquin Castro, 'very close' just in case, says the Washington Post.

'Clearly, if you were putting together a list of five people in the country who could potentially be a contributing running mate, you would have to put Julian Castro on that list,' Henry Cisneros, former HUD Secretary for Bill Clinton, told WaPo.

This photo of Hillary Clinton and Julian Castro, taken at an event in Los Angeles last year, appeared on Castro's old facebook page, which has since been shut down to make way for his new Housing and Urban Development Secretary page. Clinton is reportedly grooming Castro to join her 2016 presidential campaign as her number two

'A lot of people have mentioned the Clinton-Castro ticket, which I think would be very attractive,' Democratic strategist Maria Cardona told Real Clear Politics last year.

The rising Democratic star has long been considered a potential running mate for Clinton or another Democratic presidential candidate in 2016, but until recently he didn't have the kind of national profile and experience that is generally associated with the nation's second in command.

That all changed when President Barack Obama nominated him as HUD secretary in May, a position he was confirmed for last month.

At 39, Castro is now the youngest member of Obama's Cabinet. Castro was previously approached by the president to serve as transportation secretary but passed, against the advice of his mentor.

'I advised that he accept a position for President Obama,' Cisernos, a former San Antionio Mayor himself, told the New York Times in April.

'I thought that if he was going to be vice-presidential material in 2016, then he needed to be more than mayor at that time.'

The second time around, the Hispanic politician accepted the opportunity to serve the president, a nod toward his own aspirations to become Commander in Chief.

A graduate of Stanford and Harvard Law, Castro returned home and became the youngest person to serve on San Antonio City Council before winning three terms as mayor of San Antonio. He resigned that position at the end of last month to join the Obama administration.

In 2012 Castro became the first Latino to give a Democratic National Convention keynote address, rocketing him to national prominence.

The relatively young leader has his first memoir coming out in 2015 - an important item on the presidential checklist.

In a viral video produced for a 2012 gridiron dinner, Castro mocks his well-known presidential aspirations, asking his iPhone: 'Should I run for higher office?'

'Ay, mijo, of course you should,' Siri responds. 'Your momma would slap you with her chanclas for asking such a question.'

A smiling Castro tell his phone: 'Thank you, Siri, it's been a delightful conversation.'

'You're welcome, Mr. Presidente,' she replies.

The humor of the faux phone conversation is not just in Castro's transparent political ambitions. It's the fact that the politician of Latino descent doesn't speak Spanish.

Still, he's seen as the left's answer to two influential Hispanic Republicans - fellow Texas politician Sen. Ted Cruz and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, both of whom are mulling 2016 presidential runs.

If either lawmaker wins the Republican Party's nomination or earns a spot on the presidential ticket and Clinton is the Democratic nominee, Castro is considered the likely choice to join the Hillary 2016 campaign.

And, as the Post and others point out, the Clintons and Castro have an increasingly cozy relationship.

In the last month Castro has appeared at an event in New York with Hillary Clinton and visited her home in Washington, D.C. for dinner.

Sources present at the gathering told the Post that Castro and Clinton didn't have 'the talk' at dinner and instead discussed his new job.

But it's likely that such a discussion will take place in the future if Clinton throws her hat into the ring in 2016.

Asked by ABC News' Robin Roberts in May about Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren - another potential running mate - and Castro, Clinton talked both Democratic politicians up.

They’re both extraordinary leaders and great political advocates for a lot of what needs to be done in our country, and I admire both of them greatly,' she said.For Castro, at least, the feeling is mutual.

The former San Antonio mayor told Real Clear Politics last August that he would support Clinton if she ran for president again.

'I believe she should and that if she does, she’ll win,' he said.

'She’s had an amazing career, understands policy backwards and forwards, and in 2008, I was extremely impressed by her grasp of policy.

I believe that she would offer very strong and steady leadership for the United States.'
