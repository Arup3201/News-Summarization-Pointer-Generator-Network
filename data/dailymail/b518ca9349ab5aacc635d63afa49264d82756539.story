The moment a motorist swerved in front a lorry and slammed on his brakes- just to unleash a barrage of abuse at the HGV driver - has been caught by the vehicle's on board camera.

The footage shows the Ford Fiesta veering in front of the lorry, before screeching to a halt, bringing traffic to a stand-still on the busy A53 dual carriageway in Etruria, Staffordshire.

The driver cuts up the HGV before it collides with the back of his car sending it rolling up the road with the door wide open.

The footage was captured from a camera fixed in the HGV cab and enabled the haulage driver to prove he was not to blame for the incident

A man can then be seen getting out his vehicle before shouting abuse directed at the lorry driver.

After driving off he then pulls up on a kerb on the busy road and does the same a further two times before he finally stops and approaches the cab.

The matter was not reported to police and was resolved at the scene after the driver decided against making an insurance claim after he spotted the camera.

Haulage company Barry Proctor Services Ltd said all 26 of their vehicles were fitted with cameras around two years ago after a driver was involved in an accident.

Managing director Barry Proctor said: 'At the time, the other driver admitted it was his fault then he changed his mind.

'Sometimes I have complaints from car drivers about our trucks so the good thing about the cameras is we can download the footage, save it onto a computer and email it to the person who has complained.

'In most cases, our driver isn’t to blame.'

The vehicle camera was made by SmartWitness.
