David Tredinnick claimed medics should look to the stars to take the 'pressure' off struggling hospitals

The NHS crisis could be solved if doctors used astrology, a Tory MP has claimed.

David Tredinnick claimed medics should look to the stars to take the 'pressure' off struggling hospitals.

The MP for Bosworth in Leicestershire argued that astrology should 'have a role to play' in healthcare.

Mr Tredinnick is a member of the influential health select committee, as well as the committee for science and technology.

He has also been vice chairman of the government's herbal medicines working group.

In an interview with this month's Astrological Journal, he raised the prospect of using it to tackle problems in the NHS.

He said: 'There would be a huge row over resources.

'However, I do believe that astrology and complementary medicine would help take the huge pressure off doctors.

'Ninety per cent of pregnant French women use homeopathy. Astrology is a useful diagnostic tool enabling us to see strengths and weaknesses via the birth chart.

'And, yes, I have helped fellow MPs. I do foresee that one day astrology will have a role to play in healthcare.'

Last year Mr Tredinnick suggested members of the public with health problems should turn to astrology for answers.

He claimed astrology had a 'proven track record' at helping people recover from sickness and should be incorporated in to standard medical treatments.

In the new interview, Mr Tredinnick, claimed people who opposed astrology were 'racist'.

He said: 'The opposition (to astrology) is based on what I call the SIP formula - superstition, ignorance, and prejudice.

'It tends to be based on superstition, with scientists reacting emotionally, which is always a great irony.

'They are also ignorant, because they never study the subject and just say that it is all to do with what appears in the newspapers, which it is not, and they are deeply prejudiced, and racially prejudiced, which is troubling.'

The MP for Bosworth in Leicestershire claimed that almost all pregnant French women use astrology, which should 'have a role to play' in healthcare

He added that opponents to astrology were 'bullies', saying: 'Astrology offers self-understanding to people.

'People who oppose what I say are usually bullies who have never studied astrology.

'They never look at it. They are absolutely dismissive. Astrology may not be capable of passing double-blind tests but it is based on thousands of years of observation.

'Hippocrates said, 'A physician without a knowledge of astrology has no right to call himself a physician,'

'Astrology was until modern times part of the tradition of medicine. I think it is a great pity that so many scientists today are dismissive of right-side brain energy, such as intuition.

'People such as Professor Brian Cox, who called astrology 'rubbish' have simply not studied the subject.

'The BBC is quite dismissive of astrology and seeks to promote the science perspective and seems always keen to broadcast criticisms of astrology.'
