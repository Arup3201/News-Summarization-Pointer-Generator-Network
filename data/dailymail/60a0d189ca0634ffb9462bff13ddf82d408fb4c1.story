A 13-year-old Missouri girl has been found 850 miles from home in New Mexico with a 55-year-old man who allegedly kidnapped her after she developed a relationship with him over Facebook.

Hannah Kennish sneaked out of her mother's house in Montrose, Missouri, Sunday morning and met Raymond Vallia, a married grandfather who had driven up from Texas to pick her up, according to police. 

She was found safe Monday afternoon in Vallia's truck when New Mexico State Police troopers pulled them over on the highway outside Moriarty, New Mexico - about 40 miles from Albuquerque. She was nearly 850 miles from home. 

Hannah Kennish, 13, ran away from her home in the tiny town of Montrose, Missouri, and was kidnapped by a 55-year-old man she met online, police say

Raymond Vallia, a 55-year-old married grandfather, has been charged with her kidnapping after he carried on a relationship with Hannah for months, police say

Vallia, a Navy veteran who lives with his wife in Texas but keep an apartment in Albuquerque, has been charged with child kidnapping. He is being held in New Mexico while he awaits extradition back to Missouri.

Her mother Amy Kennish says she awoke Sunday morning and discovered her daughter was not in her room an that the backdoor was open. After frantically searching her house and yard, she called police, she told the Kansas City Star.

'She just vanished,' Ms Kennish told the newspaper.  

An Amber Alert was issued. 

The FBI in Kansas City searched Hannah's phone and computer and discovered that she had been carrying on a relationship with Vallia for several months over social media.

Ms Kennish sobbed as she described the moment her daughter was found safe. She said she had no idea Hannah was carrying on an online relationship with a grown man

Police say she may have told Vallia that she was older than 13 - though she knew that he was 55, KOAT-TV reported. 

Police say Hannah had several social media accounts under different names. Ms Kennish said she had no idea her daughter was so active online.  

That revelation helped police track the pair to New Mexico. 

Ms Kennish was overjoyed by the revelation that her daughter was safe. 

They just said 'They have her. They have her,' she said between tears, describing the moment she learned that Hannah was located. 

Hannah is currently in the custody of child protection workers in New Mexico, awaiting a flight back to Missouri to be reunited with her family.
