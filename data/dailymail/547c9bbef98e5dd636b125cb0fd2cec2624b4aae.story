Beyonce has been blasted by animal rights organisations after a photo of the star petting a tiger cub has surfaced online.

While in Thailand with her daughter, Blue Ivy, and husband, Jay Z, the superstar family was snapped posing with an adorable baby tiger and feeding it from a bottle.

An Instagram fan site for the singer, called BeyLite, posted the photo on January 2 along with the caption: Beyonce, Jay Z & Blue #Thailand.

Beyonce, Blue Ivy and Jay Z were photographed petting a tiger cub at Thai theme park, FantaSea, in Phuket

The image was taken during the family's visit to Thai theme park FantaSea in Phuket.

In the snap, Beyonce and Blue are both wearing traditional tiaras and dangling gold earrings.

Though Blue looks positively mesmerised by her face-to-face animal encounter, the hitmaking couple has come under fire from those who claim they are contributing to animal cruelty.

Animal rights groups are slamming the couple for 'supporting an industry that relies on animal cruelty.' Pictured: Beyonce and Jay Z at FantaSea

World Animal Protection wildlife expert, Dr Jan Schmidt-Burbach released a statement in response to seeing the image online.

'A tiger is not a plaything,' he said.

'Their health and well-being should not be sacrificed for a photo opportunity.

'When you look behind the scenes, holiday snaps like these support an industry that relies on animal cruelty.

'Many tourists unwittingly contribute to the suffering of wild animals like these. 

Beyonce has been chronicling the family's trip on her Instagram account, like this snap of her in Cambodia

The photo of the Carters and the tiger was posted to a fan account, called BeyLite. Pictured: Cambodia

'They're simply not aware that their 'once in a lifetime' photo means a lifetime of misery for that animal.

'The tigers used for these photos are often crammed into tiny cages or chained to the floor for long periods.

'They are also forcibly removed from their mothers to be fed artificially by tourists.

'All in all, a far cry from their natural lives in the wild. But this sordid side of tourism is conveniently hidden from public view.'  

While Beyonce has been posting photo of the family's Southeast Asian trip on Instagram, which has included stops in Thailand and Cambodia, this image was not posted on any of the family's official social networking sites.

The Carter family aren't the first celebrities to be blasted for posing with wild animals.

One Direction allegedly also came under fire from animal rights groups after being photographed with a monkey tied up in metal chains on the set of their Steal My Girl music video. 

The Crazy In Love singers have not yet responded to the statement about the tiger cub.

MailOnline has contacted a representative for Beyonce for comment.
