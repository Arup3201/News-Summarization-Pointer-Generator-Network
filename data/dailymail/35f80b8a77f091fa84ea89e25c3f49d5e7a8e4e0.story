The woman who allegedly pulled a pubic hair-filled electric razor from her waistband and flung it at Hugh Jackman has been deemed mentally unfit for trial.

After a psychological evaluation, Kathleen Thurston will not proceed to trial on felony burglary charges she faces for unlawfully entering Jackman's Manhattan gym last April.

The 46-year-old now awaits a decision to be made regarding her fate.

Gym buff: Hugh Jackman was stalked by Kathleen Thurston while working out at his West Village, New York, gym, where he was just spotted last Wednesday

'She's been found not fit to proceed 
to trial, but I'll ask the people if they have any objection,' said 
Manhattan Supreme Court Justice Maxwell Wiley, reports the New York 
Post.

Prosecutors will now review the results of the psych exam.

In the mean time, Thurston is being held at Rikers Island in lieu of $7,500 bail.

Throughout the brief proceedings, 
reports the Post, Thurston appeared disheveled and nervous, her hands in
cuffs. She wore an inside-out track suit and did not speak, and simply 
clasped an unidentified paperback book.

If prosecutors agree with the 
evaluation results, the charges against her will be dropped and she'll 
be placed in a psychiatric facility.

Back on April 12, the buff Jackman, 
44, paid a typical Saturday visit to Gotham Gym in West Village, New 
York, where a woman confronted him inside as he was working out.

Thurston ran past the front desk in hysterics, crying and shouting that she loved the X-Men star, according to reports.

Though the woman was eventually stopped by a gym employee, she reached into her waistband and grabbed an electric razor full of her body hair, according to TMZ.

'The razor fell out of her hands when I stepped in between them,' Mike Castle, a trainer at the gym, told police.

Hugh asked the woman not to touch him, according to NYPD spokesman Sgt Tom Antonelli.

Kathleen left the gym as soon as security arrived.

She was arrested a few blocks away from the facility and charged with stalking.

'Here's a woman who obviously needs help so I just hope she get the help she needs,' the actor toldÂ CBS New York correspondent Carol D'Auria.

Jackman was reportedly shaken by the incident, fearing that the woman was grabbing for a weapon when she reached into her pants.

The New York Post reported that the woman's address is listed as a Harlem shelter for the mentally ill.

The Les Miserables star has had more than just one run-in with this stalker.

Jackman has also seen the woman outside his seven-year-old daughter's elementary school in Manhattan and outside his home in the West Village, where he lives with his wife Deborra-Lee Furness.

'I suppose for me, the primary concern is my family, obviously,' the actor told CBS New York regarding his stalker.

Kathleen was taken to Manhattan Criminal Court, where she was awaiting arraignment on Saturday night.

Jackman's next role will have him donning the adamantium claws again in James Mangold's The Wolverine.

The actor is currently beefing up for yet another turn as Wolverine in Bryan Singer's X-Men: Days of Future Past.
