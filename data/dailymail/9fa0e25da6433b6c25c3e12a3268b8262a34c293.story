The prime minister of Turkey embraced new technology this week by addressing a rally via hologram.

Recep Tayyip Erdogan recorded the message in advance, which was beamed to an audience of thousands and a political gathering on Sunday.

Mr Erdogan turned to the technology, famously deployed to bring rapper Tupac to the stage years after his death, because he was too far away to make the journey to Izmir in western Turkey.

Message: Mr Erdogan, who could not be at the event in person, encouraged members of his party ahead of elections in Turkey

The full-body hologram, which stood at around 10 feet, was greeted with whoops and cheers by appreciative members of Mr Erdogan's AKP party.

The message had been recorded in advance against a green-screen by technology company Polyvision.

Mr Erdogan used his remote address to encourage his supporters ahead of a round of elections.

According to Breitbart, he also warned of 'treasonous networks' working against him.

He told the crowd: 'We are going to the elections in the shadow of attacks prepared by treasonous networks. I urge all my mayoral candidates to not waste any of their time.'

However, despite the obvious spectacle of Mr Edrogan's delivery, he is not the world leader in holographic political speeches.

In 2012 Narendra Modi, an Indian opposition leader, used hologram technology to broadcast himself to 26 different audiences at once.

He said this was a demonstration of India's technological prowess.
