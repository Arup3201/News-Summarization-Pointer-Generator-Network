David Warner admitted he struggled to keep his composure in the moments prior to the start of the fourth Test against India - six weeks on from Phillip Hughes' death at the same venue.

The final Test of this series was always going to be an emotional affair after Hughes lost his life after being hit in the neck by a bouncer while playing for South Australia at the Sydney venue in November.

A bronze plaque in honour of Hughes had been installed outside the dressing rooms before the start of the contest and Warner made a point of placing his hand on it as he walked out to bat with fellow opener Chris Rogers.

Warner had been in the middle when tragedy struck during the Sheffield Sheild match and was clearly intent on paying tribute to his friend as he set about scoring at a blistering pace after Steve Smith had won the toss and decided to bat.

Warner kissed the ground upon reaching 63 - the score that Hughes was on when he was struck by the delivery - and after he went on to score his third century of the series to help Australia to a commanding 348 for two at stumps, the 28-year-old opener admitted that the occasion had been somewhat overwhelming.

'I had a tear in my eye this morning when I walked out to warm up and I saw Greg up in the stands and Megs (Hughes' father and sister) and it's fantastic for them to be here,' Warner said.

'The hurt and the pain that they've gone through and how much it would have hurt them to come back today - it's courageous for them to be here and I applaud them for making the effort to come down, it's fantastic.

'I was quite emotional at the anthems, the little tribute (to Hughes) beforehand sort of put those memories back in place and seeing that little smile up on the board before going out there to sing the national anthem was quite hard.

'I had a minute when I came back off before we went onto the field of play and I had my head in a towel and I had to dig deep and go out there and bat the way I know I can and try and clear my mind.

'it was tough but I got out there and got back on the horse as we should be.'
