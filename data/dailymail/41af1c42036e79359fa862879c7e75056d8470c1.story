A Columbine-obsessed Pennsylvania teen accused of stabbing 21 people at his high school in April was has been refused admission to up to eight Pittsburgh-area psychiatric hospitals, a rep for his family said.

A judge revealed on Tuesday the most recent hospital did so out of safety concerns.

Alex Hribal, who was 16 at the time of the stabbings, has been held in juvenile detention since he was arrested on April 9 at Franklin Regional High School in Murrysville, Pennsylvania. 

Nowhere to go: A psychologist hired by the family of a teen accused of injuring 21 in a stabbing spree at his Pittsburgh school says the boy has been turned away by up to eight psych hospitals

He is accused of slashing students and staff with two 8-inch kitchen knives. Westmoreland County Judge Christopher Feliciani on Friday granted a defense request to transfer the teenager to a psychiatric facility, and planned to send him to Southwood Psychiatric Hospital in Pittsburgh.  

Southwood subsequently said it was unable to accommodate Hribal, according to a statement issued by the judge.

'Southwood has security concerns,' Feliciani said in the statement. 'Counsel for defendant is investigating other options. If a facility is approved, the defendant will be transferred. The court order remains in effect,' Feliciani said. 

Officials at Southwood said that due to privacy laws, they were unable to provide further information about their reasons for rejecting Hribal.

Before Southwood's decision, seven or eight other mental health facilities denied admission to the teenager, said Bruce Chambers, a forensic psychologist hired by Hribal's defense team to evaluate him.

'Because of the high-profile nature of the case and some of the misconceptions of his mental illness, some places are not wanting to take him,' said Chambers, who is in private practice in Cranberry, Pennsylvania.

'Now that he has a court order ordering him to treatment maybe a few of these other facilities will accept him.'

Chambers testified on Friday that 16-year-old Alex Hribal planned the stabbing for April 20, the 15th anniversary of the massacre, but school was out that day. 

His attorney, Patrick Thomassey, doesn't dispute that Hribal brought two eight-inch kitchen knives from his home and attacked others before classes began that morning.

But Thomassey maintains the boy has deep-seated mental health issues that would be better addressed in juvenile court.

Dark anniversary: Hribal's psychologist testified on Friday that 16-year-old Alex Hribal planned the stabbing for April 20, the 15th anniversary of the massacre, but school was out that day

Thomassey has said he plans to ask a judge to move the case from Common Pleas to juvenile court, where the judge would be able to incarcerate or supervise Hribal only until he's 21.

If he's convicted as an adult, he would likely face decades in prison. Prosecutors are expected to argue that Hribal should continue to be treated as an adult.

Hribal's trial had been scheduled to begin October 6, but was postponed indefinitely to resolve some legal issues.

During the Columbine High School massacre in 1999, Dylan Klebold and fellow senior student Eric Harris killed 12 students and one teacher and injured 26 others before taking their own lives.

The large-scale attack also involved a fire bomb used to distract fire fighters.

At the time, it was the worst school shooting in the country's history before in 2012, shooter Adam Lanzo killed 20 students and six teaching staff at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut.
