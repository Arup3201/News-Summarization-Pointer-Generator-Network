A £700,000 house once owned by Titanic star Kate Winslet with 
spectacular views of the Cornish coast has been destroyed by fire.

Firefighters tackled the blaze at Castle Minor, which dates back to 1899, but it was completely gutted by fire.

The two-storey property was ablaze on their arrival at the cliffside 
property where both access and locating a water supply proved very 
difficult.

Remote: Oscar-winning actress Kate Winslet bought Castle Minor in 2001 for just £380,000 as a bolt hole for her then husband film director Sam Mendes and their daughter

Oscar-winning actress Kate Winslet bought the property in 2001 for just 
£380,000 as a bolt hole for her then husband film director Jim Threapleton 
and their daughter Mia.

But the couple, who divorced months later, never took up residence despite spending tens of thousands of pounds on renovations.

The couple eventually sold Castle Minor to an ex-pat living in America for £700,000.

However, it is believed that the building had been empty for some time 
and had become a regular haunt for homeless down-and-outs.

When first built, the property in Tintagel, Cornwall, boasted of being one of the first in Britain to have electric lighting.

Romance: Kate Winslet, left in 2011, bought the property in 2001 for just £380,000 as a bolt hole for her then husband film director Jim Threapleton and their daughter Mia. The couple married in1998 but divorced three years later

Rough sleepers were known to have bedded down in the building at various times while many believe the house is haunted.

John Mappin, who owns the nearby King Arthur’s Castle Hotel and provided bacon sandwiches and coffee for the
firemen on Tuesday, said some in the area believed the blaze was started by the home's resident ghost.

'They say the engineer led a lonely 
life down at the house, and his ghost remained there after his death,' he said.

'The 
fire is a mystery as there was no electricity down there. It was pouring
with rain when the fire started, and we have not seen anyone down 
there.'

Mark Salter, fire station manager at Delabole, who attended the blaze 
said: 'There was so much damage it is difficult to say what caused the 
fire. It is now a total wreck with no roof.'

Police investigating the cause of the blaze said: 'We have not ruled out arson.'

Miss
Winslet and Threapleton, 34, a film director, divorced in late 2001. They 
had met soon after her triumph in the 1997 blockbuster Titanic. Miss 
Winslet called him her 'glorious boy'.

She
married the down-to-earth Yorkshireman in a simple ceremony in 1998, 
followed by bangers and mash and Bakewell tart at the local pub.

But their marriage ended in divorce, with Miss Winslet implying he had 
been unable to deal with her stardom. She called the marriage 'a **** 
up'.

The actress moved 
on to start dating Mendes, a successful director, and after a passionate
romance, they married in 2003. Their son, Joe, was born the same year, 
and the family moved to New York in late 2005.

An earlier version of this story carried a headline that suggested the fire was started by squatters.  We are happy to clarify that this was not the case.
