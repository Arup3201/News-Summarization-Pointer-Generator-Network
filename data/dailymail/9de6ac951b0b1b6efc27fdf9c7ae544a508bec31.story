Jailed: Paul Rishworth, from York, was handed six years for throttling his girlfriend until she blacked out

A jealous boyfriend has been jailed for six years for strangling his girlfriend and telling her 'I want to see your last breath.’

Paranoid Paul Rishworth, 27, twice throttled his terrified victim so hard that she blacked out, a court heard.

Sentencing, Recorder Gregory Perrins told him: 'You are, in my judgment, a paranoid, aggressive and ultimately violent individual and someone who is a danger to women with whom you are in a relationship.'

Both the attacks were 'without justification and without provocation'. The earlier one had been 'horrific' and the later one 'sickening'.

'Had the police not attended, which is something you were anxious to prevent happening, the injuries to her would have been significantly worse.'

Prosecutor Nicholas Adlington told York Crown Court that the woman suffered bruising and cuts to her face and neck, but no long-term injuries. The couple had been in an on-off relationship for a year.

Between the throttling attacks Rishworth had bombarded her with phone calls in which he was angry one moment and placid the next. She sought refuge in a friend’s house for a week.

The first attack, on September 21 last year, only ended when a friend arrived.

Six months later, on March 9, Rishworth arrived at her home while she was getting ready to have a bath, and locked himself in the bathroom with her and repeatedly throttled her. His eyes were glazed and he appeared high on drugs.

She was terrified he was going to kill her and managed to phone 999 on one phone while he was going through another looking for evidence she had been cheating on him. But he again throttled her.

When police arrived, Rishworth was sitting calmly in the house 'as if nothing had happened', said Mr Adlington.

Rishworth, of York, pleaded guilty to attempted grievous bodily harm with intent and causing actual bodily harm. He was given a restraining order banning him from contacting the woman, going near her or harassing her in any way indefinitely.

Mitigating Nicholas Barker claimed that Rishworth was a 'broken and fragile individual' and that he had only intended to talk to the woman when he went to her house on March 9 this year - an argument rejected by the judge.

York Crown court heard Paul Rishworth, 27, committed the attacks 'without justification and without provocation'

Mr Barker said the relationship had been 'volatile' and Rishworth did like the woman. He had no memory about what he had done to her because he had taken alcohol and drugs, but he was remorseful.

'He knows he needs help and he is willing to receive and accept that help,' said Mr Barker.

Detective Inspector Shaun Page, of North Yorkshire Police, welcomed the sentence and urged other domestic violence victims to come forward.

He said: 'A dangerous man has been taken off the streets and now has to face up to the consequences of his actions. His sentence will give him ample time to reflect on his actions and seek help to address his violence.

'Anyone who is suffering at the hands of a violent partner or family member should not hesitate to contact the police.'
