A KBR contract worker who claims she was brutally drugged and raped while working in Iraq broke down as she spoke of her alleged ordeal in court.

Almost six years after the event, Jamie Leigh Jones told jurors she 
was 'scared to death' and held against her will by her employer after 
being sexually assaulted in Iraq at the hands of co-workers.

The 26-year-old, from Texas, is one of several female contract 
workers for KBR and its former parent Halliburton Co. who claim they 
were sexually assaulted or harassed while working for the companies in 
Iraq.

Miss Jones said that 
while she was a clerical worker at Camp Hope in Baghdad in 2005, she was raped 
so violently her breast implants were ruptured, her pectoral muscles 
were torn and she was severely bruised.

When she reported the rape to KBR officials, she said they placed her under armed guard, held her 
in a shipping container for hours and wouldn't allow her to make a phone
call.

She claims she eventually managed to escape the ordeal by convincing one of the guards to let her use his 
phone, which she used to call her father in the United States.

After the ordeal she had to have two breast operations and hundreds of sessions with a psychiatrist, according to her testimony.

In court, Jones said her chest was so disfigured after the incident she needed two reconstructive breast operations - with the first unsuccessful.

She became depressed after the attack and developed Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, she said.

'I was excited to get the memory of 
Baghdad off of me,' Jones said of the plastic surgery. 'Yes, I could 
cover it up [with clothing]… but why do I have to be constantly reminded
of it?'

Miss Jones is suing KBR, Halliburton 
and a former KBR firefighter she says was one of her rapists, all of 
whom deny her allegations.

During
her often tearful testimony, Jones said she had been drinking with a 
group of KBR firefighters outside her barracks before she was raped.

'One of the firefighters, he handed me the drink. He said: "Don't worry I saved all the ruffies for Dubai," Jones testified.

She said she was drugged with what she believes was the sedative Rohypnol, widely known as a date-rape drug and also known by the nickname 'ruffies'.

Miss Jones said she woke up the next 
morning in her room and discovered she was naked, sore and had bruises 
and scratches on her thighs and wrists.

She
said he had no memory of what happened to her. She said she found Bortz
in the room with her and he told her that they had had sex the night 
before.

'I was putting the pieces together. I was figuring it out. I knew I had been raped,' Jones said.

At one point during her testimony, she took a short break to regain her composure.

According to the lawsuit: 'When she 
awoke the next morning still affected by the drug, she found her body 
naked and severely bruised, with lacerations, blood running down her 
leg, her breast implants ruptured, and her pectoral muscles torn – which
would later require reconstructive surgery.'

Her account was confirmed by U.S. Army 
physician Jodi Schultz.who gave the rape kit she used to gather evidence
from Ms Jones to KBR security forces.

The rape kit later disappeared and was 
recovered two years later, but missing crucial photographs and notes, 
according to the Guardian.

Miss Jones told jurors that after getting dressed and reporting for work, she realised what had happened to her and had a friend take her to get medical treatment.

After being examined by a military doctor, several KBR officials were crass towards her and tried to bully her into giving a statement about what happened, she claimed.

They then allegedly locked her in a trailer with no food or water or any means of communication.

'I'm
scared to death. I want my dad. He's my protector,' Jones said. 'As I'm
banging on the door, I say I need to get out of here. I need a phone. I
need to contact my dad.'

Jones said she eventually contacted her father, who called U.S. Rep. Ted Poe, R-Texas, who helped to secure her release.

Jones' attorneys have accused KBR and Halliburton of having a history of failing to protect workers who were sexually assaulted or harassed. The companies say they enforce rules against sexual harassment.

She testified she's been treated for 
post-traumatic stress disorder, takes medications for anxiety and had to
have reconstructive surgery for her breasts, which were disfigured in 
her alleged attack.

KBR said the case 'presents very 
disturbing allegations that we take very seriously. We welcome the 
opportunity to present what really happened in Iraq in July 2005.'

Bortz's attorney tried to discredit Jones' claims this afternoon by suggesting to jurors that she has a history of making false accusations of sexual harassment.

Bortz, who has not been charged, filed a countersuit against Jones that the jury also will decide at the trial.

Jones has said she asked to be transferred to Iraq after being sexually harassed by a KBR supervisor in Houston.

She said she entered into a sexual relationship with the supervisor for fear of losing her job.

But Andrew McKinney, Bortz's 
attorney, suggested when he questioned Jones that her relationship with 
the ex-supervisor was consensual, showing jurors emails in which Jones 
asked her mother about relationship advice related to the supervisor.

Jones said she never told her mother the true nature of the relationship.

'The things I had to do to keep my job I hate myself for,' Jones said.

KBR and Halliburton had contended 
Jones' case should be settled through arbitration as stipulated in her 
contract. But an appeals court let her lawsuit go to trial.

Due in part to Jones' case, federal lawmakers in 2009 approved a measure prohibiting contractors and subcontractors that receive $1 million in funds from the Department of Defense from requiring employees to resolve sexual assault allegations and other claims through arbitration.

Jones is asking for unspecified damages from KBR and Halliburton, which split in 2007.

The trial is expected to last up to three weeks.
