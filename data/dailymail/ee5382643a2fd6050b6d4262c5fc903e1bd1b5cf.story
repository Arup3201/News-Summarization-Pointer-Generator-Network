Tragedy: Off-duty Detective Constable Ian Smollet died after being hit by a truck on the M8 near Edinburgh

An off-duty police officer has died after being struck by a tanker truck on a busy motorway.

Detective Constable Ian Smollet, 35, stepped out of a vehicle on the hard shoulder of the M8 outside Edinburgh when he was hit by a Leyland DAF tanker truck.

The father-of-two from Livingston, West Lothian, suffered serious injuries in the collision which took place on Thursday afternoon.

He was taken to Edinburgh Royal Infirmary but lost his battle for life that evening.

Police Scotland offered their sympathies to Mr Smollet’s wife Laura, his two young daughters and the rest of his family and friends.

Chief Superintendent Gill Imery said: ‘It is with the deepest regret I can confirm that Detective Constable Ian Smollet, who served in the Lothians and Scottish Borders Division, has died following Thursday’s collision.

‘Our sympathies are with his family, friends and colleagues at this very difficult time.

‘Road policing officers are continuing their investigation and I would urge any members of the public who witnessed the collision or who believe they can assist with this inquiry to contact police immediately.’

The collision took place between junctions two and three on the westbound carriageway and the road was closed for at least five hours.

In a statement released through Police Scotland, Mr Smollet’s family said yesterday: ‘Ian was a caring and loving husband, an amazing dad and will be missed immensely.

‘We would ask that the media respect our privacy and allow us to grieve in private.’

Neighbours expressed their sadness. Rachel Smith, 40, said: ‘I am in shock. The family has always been very friendly, it’s so upsetting.’
