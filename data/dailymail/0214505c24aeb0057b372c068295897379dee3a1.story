The Wiggles' Facebook tribute said, 'It is with great sadness that we report the death of a beautiful little girl, Indie Rose. Indie passed away early this morning after a long fight with Infant Acute Lympoblastic Leukaemia.

'We had the wonderful opportunity to meet Indie last year and we will miss her dearly. Our thoughts and prayers are with this little angel, along with her mum, dad and family. Rest in peace, Indie.'

The Facebook post announcing Indie Rose's death said, 'This morning (Saturday) at 12.30am Indie Rose Taurima grew her angel wings and went to heaven. She was lying in mummy's arms pain free and slipped away in her sleep. Love you baby girl.'

A post on Tuesday written by Indie Rose's mother Jennifer Smith, said: 'We have been so blessed to have another week with our beautiful girl. She has become so fragile and sleeps for majority of the day.

'Her little body is tiny and is getting weaker each day. Our occupational therapist gave Indie a special chair to help support her body as she now prefers to sit up because her liver and spleen are very enlarged it's extremely uncomfortable to lay down.

'Her face and appearance has changed dramatically over the past week but when she looks into my eyes I see my baby girl full of fight and determination. I knew that Sunday was going to be my last Mother's Day with Indie but she has enriched my life so much I am forever grateful.

'We are so glad Indie has managed to touch so many peoples lives in her short time here on earth. We know the end is very close but we are going to make sure every minute is special and full of love and laughter.'

The post received more than 2,500 comments from people offering their condolences by Sunday night.

Taurima rose to prominence after his silver medal win in long-jump and was dubbed Jumping Jai and there was media attention given to this smoking, drinking, diet and Superman tattoo.

Sydney 2000 Olympic medallist Taurima and his partner Ms Smith acknowledged in March they were only expecting their young daughter to live for another week, reported The Canberra Times.

At the time, even kissing their daughter's head would bruise her.

The former Olympian brought his daughter's third birthday forward from May 22 to a date in March and celebrated with Sydney's Westmead Children's Hospital nurses, who dressed up for the occasion.

Indie Rose was diagnosed with infant acute lymphoblastic leukaemia at just three months old and spent most the past three years in hospital.

The little girl was the couple's only child and Taurima previously said her illness had been 'tough'.

'You get told by the doctors that there's no more treatments they can give her, you cry a river of tears,' he said.

The two-year-old was set to become the first child in Australia to trial a new leukaemia treatment from the United States, but was unable to because she developed an infection in her lungs

By her side: Taurima and Ms Smith temporarily lived across the road from the Sydney Children's Hospital, where they spent up to nine hours a day with their daughter

The former athlete said Indie Rose being born with leukaemia 'it's like one-in-five million or something ridiculous'.

As part of her treatment the young girl had three intense chemotherapy treatments and a bone marrow transplant.

Indie Rose was set to become the first child in Australia to trial a new leukaemia treatment from the United States, but was unable to because she became to week after developing an infection in her lungs just days before the drug arrived in the country.

Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia is the most common form of cancer in children but can also affects adults.

The disease sees an overproduction of immature white blood cells, called lymphoblasts or leukaemic blasts. These cells crowd the bone marrow and preventing it making normal blood cells.

These can also spill out into the blood stream and circulate around the body.

More than 300 people in Australia are diagnosed with the illness each year according to leukaemia.org.au.

The disease is considered rare, making up 0.3 per cent of all diagnosed cancers.

While the disease can occur at any age, it is most common in children aged 0-14 years and this age group accounts for 60 per cent of all cases

It is the most common type of childhood leukaemia, and the most common childhood cancer

The disease is more common in males than in females

Its exact causes are unknown

The trail was the 'end of the line' for her treatment options.

'We didn't want the doctors to tell us 'that's it', but we kind of knew. When they did tell us, that's when it hit home that we won't have our little girl for very long,' Taurima said.

The Olympic medallist said it was a 'catch-22' situation, because his daughter could have died in intensive care, or they could spend three weeks playing and having fun with her.

Taurima and Ms Smith temporarily lived across the road from the Sydney Children's Hospital, where they spent up to nine hours a day with their daughter.

'It's easier to win a medal at the Olympics than go through the past two years,' he said.

The former athletics star said prior to Indie Rose's death that it would be easier to let her go, because from a selfish perspective, it was so painful watching her suffer.

He added that fostering might be an option for the couple wanted to have kids the future, but was thinking about fostering, because 'we can give them a lot of love as well'.

Taurima, 41, has worked with the Australian Federal Police in Canberra since his athletics retirement and worked as a protective service officer to former prime ministers John Howard, Kevin Rudd and Julia Gillard, reported The Canberra Times.
