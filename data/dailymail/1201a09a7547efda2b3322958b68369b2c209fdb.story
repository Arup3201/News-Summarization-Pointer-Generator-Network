We've all been there - the big smiles on a night out, followed by the horror the following day at Facebook pictures revealing a wobbly chin, dark eye bags or mouth wrinkles.

After one such morning, Diane Clarke decided to take action - booking herself in for £15,000 of plastic surgery and Botox, so that she would never again take a bad selfie.

The 63-year-old from Milton Keynes used to hate looking at photos of herself because she looked much older than her young friends.

Diane Clarke, 63, from Milton Keynes used to hate looking at pictures of herself, so she spent thousands on botox and a face lift. Now she documents her new face with a selfie every day.

After being horrified by her wrinkles in a picture at a friend's wedding, she decided that expensive face cream was no longer enough and that she wanted to go under the knife.

Diane has now spent a total of £15,000 on facelifts and botox in order to roll back the years.

To celebrate her new youthful looks, she takes a selfie of her younger-looking face each day.

She said: 'When you have pics taken from afar, the camera is more forgiving, but I wanted to look good close up too.

'Seeing photos of me compared to my other friends made me feel so insecure. I looked so old but still felt young inside.

'I hated my crow's feet and when I compared myself to my friends in pictures, they all looked so much younger than me.'

She continued: 'I remember walking past a shop window and catching a glimpse of my reflection in it and thinking I looked like my mother. It was horrifying.

'No amount of face cream was ever going to fix those wrinkles. Going under the knife was the only option if I wanted to look as young as I feel.

'The surgeon said he could turn back the clock by at least five years and I was more than happy with that.  

'It may have cost £15,000 for a facelift and botox but it was worth it for the perfect selfie.'

Diane, from Milton Keynes, Bucks., started botox in 2004 at Aurora Clinics in High Wycombe when she was 53.

Despite returning twice a year, costing £170 a time, Diane was shocked at how old she looked when she was photographed at a friend's wedding in September 2009.

Since the surgery, Diane is delighted with the compliments she gets on her youthful looks 

In January 2013, she made the decision to pay £5,000 to go under the knife so that she could take the perfect selfie.

The procedure, called a minimal access cranial suspension facelift, meant two cuts were made in front of each of Diane's ears before the skin was pulled back. 

She added: 'One particular photo of me at a wedding just tipped me over the edge.

'When I looked at the picture I was horrified. I looked so old and wrinkly, I just couldn't believe it was me.

'Coming around (from the surgery), it was quite funny to see my face all bandaged up. At first I questioned what I had done.'

She continued: 'But as soon as I was out of hospital and the bandages were off, I was pointing the camera at myself.

'Flicking through my folder of selfies, I was absolutely amazed to see I looked about eight years younger.

'I hadn't told any of my friends that I was having it done, so when they saw me they were all so shocked and kept showering me with compliments.

'They were all so impressed that the surgeon had managed to iron me out. 

'£5,000 isn't much to pay to look good in photos.' 

Since the surgery, Diane - a retired university PA - has continued to have botox twice a year to 'top up' her face.

Diane is also considering having a second face lift to look even sharper in snaps

She added: 'I know some people might say I've been to extreme lengths for the perfect selfie. I do feel very vain but taking selfies is so addictive.'

Her plastic surgeon Adrian Richards, of Aurora Clinics, said: 'Modern technologies like selfies are causing us to think and feel differently about our appearance.

'21st century devices and applications are showing us how we actually look, rather than how we think we look.

'Barely a week doesn't by without me discussing this issue with people who are concerned because of their appearance on their smart phone or tablet.'
