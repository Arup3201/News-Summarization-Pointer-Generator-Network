The coaches of 16-year-old weightlifter Chika Amalaha will be investigated after the Nigerian was stripped of her Commonwealth gold for failing a drugs test.

The International Weightlifting Federation (IWF) has announced it will ‘seriously investigate’ Amalaha’s entourage to find out how she came to have amiloride and hydrochlorothiazide, a banned diuretic and masking agent, in her system.

The case has also been referred to the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), with Amalaha likely to receive a two-year ban for a first-time offence.

Investigation: Nigerian weightlifter Chika Amalaha has been stripped of her Commonwealth Games gold

Trouble: A test of on the 16-year-old revealed traces of diuretics and maskings agents

Her ‘B’ sample matched the findings of
 her ‘A’ sample, prompting the Commonwealth Games Federation (CGF) to 
award her gold to Dika Toua from Papua New Guinea, with India’s Santoshi
 Matsa upgraded to silver and Swati Singh, also from India, given the 
bronze.

Amalaha did not contest the decision.

Dr Tammy Danagogo, 
Nigeria’s sports minister, admitted the positive test was ‘embarrassing’
 and warned: ‘Coaches who are found to encourage or condone cheating of 
any kind would face severe sanctions’.

An IWF spokesman said: ‘Considering the young age of the athlete, the IWF will seriously investigate the entourage as well.’
