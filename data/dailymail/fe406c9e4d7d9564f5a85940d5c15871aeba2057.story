Debris from the rocket carrying China's first moon rover plummeted to earth in a village more than 620 miles (1,000 km) from the launch site, according to a report.

People living near the wreckage claimed the metallic debris crashed into two homes and it is not the first time the area has been hit by rocket parts.

The incident, which was reported on Monday, is believed to have occurred in Suining County in the central province of Hunan, around nine minutes after the launch of the Chang'e-3 mission.

The area has been hit by space wreckage nearly 20 times, the Xiaoxiang Morning Post said.

One local resident told the newspaper: ‘Three of the roof beams have crashed down on our house, and a big hole has been punched into our barn.

Another said: ‘The huge sound scared the living daylights out of me.’

The incident, which was reported on Monday and is thought to have torn a hole in the roof of a small house, occurred around nine minutes after the launch of the Chang'e-3 mission in Suining county in the central province of Hunan

Authorities gave the residents 10,800 yuan (£1,081) and 5,200 yuan (£521) in compensation, according to the newspaper, which reported that no one was injured.

A Long March-3B carrier rocket, China's most powerful rocket, blasted off at around 1:30 am Monday from the Xichang Satellite Launch Centre in south western China.

The lunar rover mission known as 'Jade Rabbit' is part of China's ambitious space programme, which aims to establish a permanent space station by 2020 and eventually send a human to the moon.

But debris from China's numerous space launches has frequently found its way to Suining county, which has been hit by rocket parts nearly 20 times since the early 1990s, according to the newspaper.

Last May wreckage from a rocket sent up by the Xichang Launch Centre crashed into homes and hit a high-voltage wire in the area, according to the Shanghai Daily News.

In October 2011 a steel frame weighing more than 250 kilograms, or 550 pounds, landed in a field after another satellite launch and other wreckage pierced a house roof.

China launched its first extra-terrestrial landing craft into orbit yesterday in the hope of becoming the first country in almost 40 years to soft-land a probe on the moon.

The nation is only the third in history to launch an unmanned lunar probe, which has been nicknamed 'Jade Rabbit' after a Chinese folklore character.

The probe, which can climb inclines of up to 30 degrees and travel up to 200 metres per hour, is targeted to land within a huge volcanic crater known as Sinus Iridum, which means the Bay of Rainbows, on about December 14

President Xi Jinping has said he wants China to establish itself as a space superpower and the mission has inspired widespread pride in China's growing technological prowess.

State television showed a live broadcast of the rocket lifting off.

If all goes smoothly, the rover will conduct geological surveys and search for natural resources after the probe touches down on the moon in mid-December.

It is designed to roam the lunar surface for at least 90 Earth days – three Lunar days – covering an area of about five square kilometres.

It will send probes beneath the surface as well as taking high-resolution images of the rock, a flat area formed from the molten basalt released by lunar volcanoes several billion years ago.

The journey of the probe and its final landing will be closely monitored by the European Space Agency (ESA), which is cooperating closely with China.
