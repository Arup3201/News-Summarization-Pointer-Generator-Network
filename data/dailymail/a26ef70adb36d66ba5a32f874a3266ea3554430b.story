As Sportsmail continues it's 'HANDS OFF IN THE BOX' campaign in an attempt to rid the game of grappling defenders and shirt-pulling in the area, we highlight Tuesday night's offenders in which there were incidents in both the Champions League and the Championship. 

ARSENAL 3-3 ANDERLECHT

Nacho Monreal was punished for pulling in the box, the offence that prompted Sportsmail’s campaign after grappling excesses in the Premier League. 

The Spanish defender hauled down substitute Aleksandar Mitrovic and French referee Clement Turpin awarded the penalty to put life into Anderlecht.

Former Portsmouth man Anthony Vanden Borre duly converted from the spot.

LEEDS 2-2 CHARLTON

At a time when officials are looking out for shirt-pulling following the Mail's 'Hands off in the Box campaign' Leeds United became the latest club to pay for grappling in the penalty area when Guiseppe Bellusci foolishly conceded a crucial late spot-kick at Elland Road.

Bellusci grabbed Charlton defender Tal Ben Haim and pulled him to the floor to stop him reaching a Johnnie Jackson corner.

And when his indiscretion was spotted by referee Graham Salisbury, Johann Gudmundsson scored an 81st minute equaliser from the resulting penalty.
