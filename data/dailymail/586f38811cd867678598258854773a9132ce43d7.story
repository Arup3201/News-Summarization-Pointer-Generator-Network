Top gloss: Tamara's bouncy blow-dry

From Sloanes to WAGs, no one has gorgeous, flowing manes of hair like very rich women do.

And they don't get much richer than Tamara Ecclestone, the perma-tanned, yacht-flitting daughter of Formula 1 boss Bernie, who recently married in a £7 million extravaganza in the south of France and is said to be worth £300 million.

Socialite Tamara's bouncy blow-dry puts even the Duchess of Cambridge to shame. It speaks of luxury, pampering and - whisper it - the free time to spend in expensive salons which comes of not having to work.

Which is why her latest venture, Show Beauty, a premium haircare range comprising 11 'volumising, thickening, conditioning and finishing products for the world's most discerning customers', has attracted so much attention.

The 'indulgent and luxurious' line is stocked only in the most exclusive department stores - Selfridges, Harvey Nichols and Harrods.

Every product is scented with a fragrance developed by Givaudan, the eminent perfume house behind iconic scents including L'Air Du Temps, Opium, Obsession and Poison.

Its adverts can be seen in upmarket glossy magazines this month, and promise us mortals the chance to look like multi-millionaires. 

The price tags are pretty striking too. The cheapest products are the dry shampoo, a texture spray and a hairspray, each of which costs £30; the most expensive is a £55 hair fragrance.

In fact, were you to purchase every product - as some women are said to have been doing in Harrods - then it would set you back £375.

For that sort of money, you would hope for a wig made of Tamara's own hair - or a shampoo and a conditioner at the very least (both of which are conspicuously absent from the line-up).

The products undoubtedly look expensive, coming in metallic bottles with quilted relief designs and chunky plastic lids that - from a distance, if you squint - look like cut-glass stoppers.

As for the fragrance - to me, it smells like burnt sugar. But apparently I'm missing the point. According to the website, Tamara's Show Beauty is 'more than a luxury haircare brand, it is a lifestyle statement and a window into the often untouchable world of elite elegance'.

I'm not sure any window is worth this sort of cash. After all, you can buy a can of Batiste dry shampoo for £2.99 and good old L'Oreal Elnett hairspray for £4.

Show off: Tamara's range of very expensive luxury haircare products

So to find out if Tamara's stuff is any better, we asked top stylist Stephen Low of London's exclusive Neville Hair & Beauty salon to blind test £245 worth of Show Beauty products against High Street best-sellers at a total of £38.01.

Stephen looks after the locks of seriously groomed posh girls such as Rosie Huntington-Whiteley and Poppy Delevingne, so he's perfectly placed to judge.

To make the test as fair as possible, we decanted all the products into clear plastic bottles or used masking tape to disguise the branding. Here's what Stephen had to say:

HAIRSPRAY

Tamara's Show Beauty Finishing Spray, £30, harrods.com

This smells terrible and it's too sticky on the hair. It does give a firm hold, but also leaves a residue on the hair if you apply too much. Not for anyone who wants a natural look with movement.

L'Oreal Elnett, £4, boots.com

I liked the fresh smell of this and it gave a good hold with no residue left behind. It brushed through the hair nicely - a good product that I would happily work with.

WINNER: High Street

DRY SHAMPOO

Tamara's Show Beauty dry shampoo, £30, harrods.com

The cloying scent was really unpleasant, although it left no residue and still created a fresh and revived look to a style.

Batiste dry shampoo,  £2.99, boots.com

I really liked the smell, but when it came to performance I was disappointed. It left a white powdery residue that might be OK on blonde hair but would really show up on a brunette.

WINNER: Tamara (as long as you can put up with the smell)

Turn up the volume: Tamara's volumising product was hard to work with

MOUSSE

Tamara's Show Beauty Lux Volume Mousse, £30, harrods.com

This had a good foam and was not too sticky. The hair looked great. I'd be happy to use this product again.

Garnier Fructis Style Big Volume Mousse, £2.65, boots.com

This was a little heavy and actually gave a bit too much grip to hair making it quite difficult to blow-dry. This meant the hair was left feeling rather tacky.

WINNER: Tamara

TREATMENT OIL

Tamara's Show Beauty Pure Treatment Oil, £50, harrods.com

This leaves a lot of residue. Be careful how much you use - it can weigh the hair down and make it look greasy.

Lee Stafford Argan Oil,  £11.99, boots.com

I wasn't impressed with this either. When you're putting oil on the hair, a light texture is essential and neither of these scored well on that front.

WINNER: Neither. I prefer Shu Uemura Nourishing Protective Oil (£39.50, feelunique.com).

VOLUME LOTION

Tamara's Show Beauty Lux Volume Lotion, £40, harrods.com

This was very hard to work with - dense, sticky, tough to blow-dry and the smell wasn't very appealing either.

Tresemme 24 Hour Body Dramatic Volume Blow Dry Lotion, £5.50, boots.com

This was also a bit too sticky on the hair - although I did like the fresh smell.

WINNER: High Street. Not my favourite volumising product, but better than the other one.

THICKENING SPRAY

Tamara's Show Beauty Divine Thickening Mist, £35, harrods.com

Although this did thicken the hair, it made it hard to blow-dry and dragged it down.

Samy Fat Hair Thickening Spray, £5.99, superdrug.com

This wasn't too sticky, blow-dried well and gave a good hold. I liked the smell, too. I would be happy to use this on my clients.

WINNER: High Street.

Knot great: Tamara's Texture Spray was heavy and tended to make hair clumpy

TEXTURE SPRAY

Tamara's Show Beauty  Premiere Working Texture  Spray, £30, harrods.com

This was heavy and I had to be very careful how much I used to avoid clumping or matting. 

Aussie Dual Personality Texturising & Conditioning Gel Spray, 150ml, £4.89, boots.com

Lightweight, with a great fresh scent.

WINNER: High Street

STEPHEN'S VERDICT

I've always felt you don't have to spend a fortune on haircare; it's about finding products that you like, not packaging or price.

The basis of gorgeous, glossy hair is a great shampoo and conditioner. If hair's not properly prepared, you won't get the best results from other products.

I won't be swapping any of my usual kit for Tamara's products - not least because I find the smell really unappealing. If you're desperate to buy them, the dry shampoo and mousse are your best bets. I wouldn't use the rest.
