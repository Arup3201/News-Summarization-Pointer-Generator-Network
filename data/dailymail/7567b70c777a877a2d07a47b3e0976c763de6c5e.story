A notorious British paedophile is expected to spend the rest of his life in a mosquito-plagued Far East prison after being convicted of raping a 15-year-old girl five years ago.

Former hairdresser David Fletcher, 67, has been sent to prison in Cambodia's insufferable Prey Sar prison to serve out a 10-year sentence after he was arrested when he was extradited from neighbouring Thailand earlier this week.

He had been convicted of rape in his absence by a court in the Cambodian capital, Phnom Penh, after he fled to Thailand in the wake of claims that he was using a charity to groom for sex a number of poverty-stricken children who lived in a rubbish dump.

Following Cambodia's request to have him extradited from Thailand, Fletcher went to the Thai Court of Appeal to fight the move - but the court upheld the Cambodian demand.

According to The Cambodia Daily, Fletcher is the first paedophile ever to be sent back to Cambodia to serve a prison sentence.

Cambodia was once the haunt of notorious child molester Gary Glitter

Last night, Mr Samleang Seila, director of the anti-paedophile group Action Pour les Enfants, spoke of his gratitude to the authorities for pressing on with their attempts to have Fletcher extradited.

'We are satisfied with this extradition,' Mr Seila told the Daily. 'Even if it took so much time, we are happy it was done.'

Fletcher, from Cambridge, has a history of assaults on children.

On one occasion in 1967, he was sentenced by the Norwich Crown Court to 18 months in jail for the statutory rape of a 15-year-old girl, who he was said to have plied with champagne.

He said of his conviction later: 'She was just my girlfriend…I just did it ahead of her 16th birthday. People will stoop very low to say bad things about me.'

Later in Cambodia police built up a file of evidence showing that Fletcher had used his charity to groom young girls - and also their families - with the intention of having sex with the them.

Cambodia was once the haunt of notorious child molester Gary Glitter, who fled to neighbouring Vietnam when authorities moved in on him. He was later arrested for sexual molestation of children in Thailand and after serving a prison sentence was deported back to the UK.
