The World Cup has started with a bang and we've seen some sensational games but, make no mistake, every football fan in the country will already be looking forward to next season.

Last year’s Premier League was one of the most dramatic we’ve ever seen and, with a new cast of characters, let’s hope for more of the same.

Louis van Gaal arrives at Manchester United fresh from Holland’s incredible destruction of world champions Spain — and the fixtures have thrown up the perfect start for the Dutchman.

Perfect start? Louis van Gaal will not face a top six side until October when he takes over at Manchester United after the World Cup

First up: Wilfried Bony (centre) and his Swansea team-mates will be Van Gaal's first challenge

Fit and firing: Van Gaal will be hoping Robin van Persie continues his World Cup form at Old Trafford

Blue is the colour: Van Gaal is aiming to regain the Premier League title from Manchester City

In contrast to David Moyes, who had a very tricky start to last season, Van Gaal has a set of relatively straight-forward games to begin with.

He opens with the same opposition as Moyes — Swansea — but Van Gaal won’t have to play a top-six team until Chelsea come to Old Trafford in October.

They are still a few good players away from being strong enough to get back to the very top, but with that run of games United could well be the early pacesetters.

For the promoted sides it’s a time of huge excitement. When are your great away days at Anfield, Stamford Bridge, Old Trafford?

Leicester’s Nigel Pearson, Sean Dyche at Burnley and that up-and-coming young manager at QPR, will be looking forward to each and every game.

Experienced: Van Gaal does not face a top six side until taking on Jose Mourinho's Chelsea in October

Top tier: Nigel Pearson led Leicester City back to the Premier League for the first time in a decade

Leicester host Everton on day one and QPR will entertain Hull, but Burnley will be absolutely delighted that they have Chelsea at home first up. It will be the Ginger Mourinho  versus Jose Mourinho, and what a game for Dyche to get his side off and running and to get Turf Moor bouncing.

Diego Costa could prove to be a new hero for Chelsea while Cesc Fabregas will join him in west London, but Arsenal fans will be in no mood for forgiveness when the sides meet.

Liverpool will try to balance another title charge with European football, but Manchester City will not let the trophy go without a fight.

The Premier League is the best in the world. It’s where every player, manager and fan wants to be. Now we know  who faces who and when.

Roll on next season.
