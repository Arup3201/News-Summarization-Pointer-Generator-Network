The NFL boasts some of the world's most recognisable sportsmen, and now their top stars are being given a makeover to look like characters from TV's most recognisable show.

Artist Adrien Noterdaem, who specialises in his depictions of famous faces in the Simpsons style, has come up with a novel idea to celebrate the programme's 25th anniversary.

Noterdaem teamed up with Bleacher Report to depict nine of the NFL's biggest stars as characters from the show. 

Denver Broncos quarterback Peyton Manning has won a superbowl ring and been NFL MVP five times

Jay Cutler has been the Chicago Bears quarterback since 2009 after making the 2008 Pro Bowl at Denver

Three-time Superbowl champion Tom Brady is perhaps the NFL's most famous face at the moment

The NFL season got back underway this month and will conclude with the Superbowl next February

High-profile quarterbacks Peyton Manning, Tom Brady and Jay Cutler get the yellow treatment, as do younger stars Colin Kaepernick and Robert Green III.

The nine-man ensemble does not have much balance, with quarterbacks dominant, but Seahawks running back Marshawn Lynch and New Orleans tight end Jimmy Graham also feature.

There are also adaptations of two defensive players, Houston's J.J. Watt and Seattle's cornerback Richard Sherman.

Seattle Seahawks running back Marshawn Lynch, who is famous for his love of Skittles, also featured

Jimmy Graham is a tight end for the New Orleans Saints and is a two-time Pro Bowler 

Two-time Defensive Player of the Year J.J. Watt is a defensive end for the Houston Texans 

Seattle Seahawks cornerback Richard Sherman was a key part of their Superbowl XLVIII winning side

The 2012 Offensive Rookie of the Year Robert Griffin III has plenty of potential but has had injury troubles

San Francisco's Colin Kaepernick led his team to the NFL's biggest game in 2012 but fell at the final hurdle
