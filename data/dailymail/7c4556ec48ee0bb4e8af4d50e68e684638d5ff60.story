Before the first glass of Champagne is poured and the first slice of foie gras is served, this is the painstaking effort that goes into creating an extravagant first-class aircraft cabin.

Air France has released a three-minute video that shows all of the work that is done by hand in its luxurious new cabin that most travellers will never step foot in.

La Premiere boasts four suites, each with a comfortable seat that folds into a bed at the press of a button, more than enough legroom, a flat-screen television and fine dining.

A one-way ticket in La Premiere costs more than £4,000 for flights between Paris and Singapore and Jakarta

Each seat in La Premiere folds into a bed that boasts a futon mattress and hypoallergenic feather pillow

The Paris-based carrier’s most expensive seats are found on its Boeing 777 aircraft which fly between Paris’ Charles de Gaulle Airport and Singapore and Jakarta, Indonesia.

A one-way flight in La Premiere from Paris to Singapore costs £4,000 to £6,300 per person, depending on the day of departure.

It costs just under £7,000 for a one-way ticket in La Premiere from Paris to Jakarta.

Titled ‘Behind the scenes in a palace’ the video shows materials and parts being delivered to a massive airport hangar in large wooden crates.

Travellers in La Premiere are treated to a number of perks, including finer meals that include foie gras

Teams of workers carefully install windows and wall and ceiling panels before laying down carpet, installing the seats, and testing all of its bells and whistles.

When it’s time to fly, travellers in La Premiere are treated to meals that are cooked on board, plenty of storage space for their belongings, and an opportunity to get a good night’s sleep.

While passengers in economy struggle to get some shut-eye, travellers in La Premiere can sleep soundly on a bed that is 6.5ft in length and 30in wide with a futon mattress, hypoallergenic feather pillow and a fluffy duvet by Sofitel My Bed.
