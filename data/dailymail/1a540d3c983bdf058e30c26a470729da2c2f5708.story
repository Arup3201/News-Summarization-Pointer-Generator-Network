Upper lips don’t come any stiffer. Sir William Dugdale — libidinous, boozing former jockey, racing driver, soccer boss and David Cameron’s belovedly wayward uncle — earned the Military Cross during World War II for extraordinary courage under fire.

But to the end of his life, he refused to brag about it.

‘When the Germans appeared, one defended oneself, and eventually a gong appeared,’ he shrugged.

The reality was more dramatic.

As a captain in the Grenadier Guards, Dugdale, who has died aged 92, had gone from being a staff junior to commanding officer in the space of three days in 1943.

Britain’s Eighth Army, the Desert Rats, were being battered under waves of attack from Rommel’s Afrika Korps.

With a unit of hand-picked men one night, Dugdale fought his way into Nazi-occupied ground — to retrieve the body of a fellow officer, and ensure the man got the burial he deserved. 

It was an act of loyal friendship and defiance that typified his character.

The Eton-educated son of a baronet could be a roistering, womanising hellraiser. 

But he was also a man to be trusted, as Margaret Thatcher was to discover 40 years later when he helped her to defeat the unions.

He was a household name in the Seventies, as chairman of Aston Villa when the club won the First Division and the European Cup. 

He famously banned Scottish supporters from the club’s terraces, after a riot during a friendly match against Rangers.

But he’s best known now as the incorrigible uncle who helped mould the character of the Prime Minister — teaching a young David Cameron how to shoot rabbits in the Warwickshire fields on a misty Saturday morning and then wolf down a meat pie watching Villa play in the afternoon.

After Dugdale married their aunt Cylla in 1967, the future PM and his older brother, Alexander, began to spend weekends at the family seat, the 350-year-old Blyth Hall, east of Birmingham.

‘They were both very bright cookies,’ the Camerons’ uncle recalled proudly. ‘And they were both into shooting and football, which I could provide. 

'When we went to the Villa, they did it in style. We sat up in the gods in the VIP bit, and went down to the dressing-room afterwards.’

It was not a typical boys’ match day. But then, Sir William was not a typical uncle. 

He was born William Stratford Dugdale in 1922 at Blyth, a Restoration-era country mansion. 

As a pupil at Eton he was frequently ‘whacked’. 

‘And it hasn’t done me any harm, but then I’ve always had a well-upholstered rear end,’ he joked years later.

Despite his rebellious streak, he could knuckle down at exam time and earned a place at Balliol College, Oxford. 

The incentive was not so much academic as alcoholic: his great ambition was to don the sky-blue bow tie and navy tailcoat of the Bullingdon Club.

Cameron claims his own involvement with the all-male drinking society is a source of embarrassment. 

His uncle, on the other hand, was proud of it, and said every night at Oxford was a party, with black-market sherry and claret to fuel their antics.

Away from the Bullingdon, he ended up ‘paralytically drunk’ with contemporaries including future Tory PM Ted Heath and Labour Chancellor Denis Healey.

But he had strong political views, and despised the pro-communist attitude of fellow students such as Roy Jenkins and Tony Crosland, both future Labour Cabinet ministers.

When Jenkins and Crosland joined a march in support of Stalin’s invasion of Finland in 1940, Dugdale and his pals sabotaged it by hurling soot bombs and buckets of water.

Unfortunately, their aim was wayward, and a police sergeant was coated. They spent the night in the cells, and were released only when they agreed to pay for a replacement uniform.

In 1943, aged 21, he had a brusque phone call from his mother Margaret — ‘a rather gung-ho sort of lady’. She suggested his time would be better employed fighting Germans, and so he enlisted.

His service with the Guards took him across North Africa and into Italy, landing during the bitter fighting in Anzio in 1944. 

As the Allies advanced, he discovered the excitement of wartime liaisons.

‘Danger enhances the libido,’ he would declare with a raffish grin. ‘So the more frightened you are, the randier you get.’

In Florence, he would go to 8am mass on Sundays — it was the best ‘hunting ground’ to meet lonely Italian women whose husbands had been killed or captured.

His autobiography Settling The Bill, published in 2011, describes how at the end of the war he drove north and saw the bodies of deposed dictator Benito Mussolini and his mistress, Clara Petacci, strung up from the roof of a petrol station.

Weeks later, he was standing guard over war criminals at the Nuremberg trials, before returning to Britain and studying to be a solicitor.

The legal life could not satisfy his need for adventure, though, and he decided instead to train as a jockey — and compete in the Grand National. 

Though he was 6ft 1in, he pared down his weight to just over 10st, with relentless dieting and a regime of Harley Street laxatives.

He achieved his ambition, riding in the 1952 National, though he was thrown just before Becher’s Brook. After that he took to motor racing.

But his obsession with speed wasn’t confined to the track: in his Jensen sports car, he would try to beat his record time driving between London and Birmingham — 101 miles in an hour and ten minutes.

As a child, his ambition had been to run the country, and he was picked as a Tory candidate for the 1959 general election. 

But his wife Belinda, with whom he had four children, became ill with an ovarian cyst and died aged just 36.

He abandoned his political dreams, and became lost in grief, drinking hard and relying on the children’s nanny to hold the household together. ‘Being a man,’ he said, ‘whisky helped.’

It was a sexual fling that snapped him out of it. Filling up his car on the Bayswater Road, he chatted up the petrol pump attendant. 

‘We went back to her bedsit and she was brisk. She told me to stop moaning and get on with it.’

He didn’t leave her flat for two days. When he got home, the nanny was furious — but the crisis was over.

After several wild years in the Sixties, with aviation his new obsession, he met and married Cylla Mount, a distant cousin of the Queen and the aunt of the Cameron boys.

He gradually became a pillar of the Establishment — chairman of Warwickshire County Council, high sheriff of the county and chief disciplinary steward of the Jockey Club.

But it was on the board of Aston Villa that he really made his mark. In 1974, he backed the appointment of manager Ron Saunders who went on to win a shelf of silverware, including the First Division trophy in 1981.

The team went on to win a shelf of silverware, including victory over Bayern Munich in the 1982 European Cup final.

But the following year Ellis fought his way back in, and Dugdale was dismissed. His old rival sent him a silk tie emblazoned with the initials SBE: ‘Sacked By Ellis’.

Instead of dwelling on traumas, his golden rule was to treat life like a ritzy but unreliable hotel: ‘If your breakfast doesn’t arrive, instead of walking out in a flounce, you should look around for a chicken leg.’

His chicken leg this time was served up by Mrs Thatcher. 

With the unions rampant, demanding a 15 per cent pay rise and threatening a national strike, he became chairman of Severn Trent Water Board and used all his charm and doggedness to settle the dispute.

Plenty of whisky on the negotiating table helped keep the talks flowing, he noted. 

And his humour helped: at one meeting, he wore a plastic carnation in his buttonhole, with a silk-stockinged leg in the centre that did the can-can every ten minutes.

To the end of his life, he invited controversy.

At the launch of his book, he set out his political philosophy: however much the Labour Party sought to deny it, the working classes wanted to be led by an aristocrat...preferably a duke.

If that wasn’t exactly what David Cameron wanted to hear from his wayward uncle, Sir William didn’t care. He never cared who he offended.
