With the website crashing under demand for tickets and prices soaring to hundreds of pounds, a seat at the BBC Proms is a coveted prize.

But for a fortunate group of ‘Prommers’ – made up of celebrities, politicians and the Corporation’s bosses – their place at the world’s largest classical music festival is all but guaranteed.

It has been revealed that the BBC spent more than £23,000 on tickets and hospitality for this year’s events, with guests as varied as Homeland star Damian Lewis, Home Secretary Theresa May, Local Government and Communities Secretary Eric Pickles, and presenter Sir David Attenborough rubbing shoulders at the licence fee payer’s expense.

The BBC spent more than £23,000 on tickets and hospitality for guests to attend The Proms this year 

And BBC bosses also handed out tickets to family members, with Diane Coyle, at the time Acting Chairman of the BBC Trust, bringing her husband – BBC Technology Correspondent Rory Cellan-Jones – to two shows and James Harding, Director of News and Current Affairs, bringing his wife to one.

Campaign groups have criticised the practice of using the licence fee to fund tickets for BBC staff and celebrities, claiming it will ‘stick in the throat’ of normal people.

The First Night at the Proms was the most popular concert for guests to attend, with the BBC spending £6,993.36 – including £264 on programmes – for 97 people to listen to the rendition of Elgar’s The Kingdom.

Information obtained through a Freedom of Information request reveals that those in the crowd at The Royal Albert Hall hosted by the BBC included Mr Lewis, Shadow Cabinet Minister Harriet Harman and Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander.

Others were also there on the request of specific BBC executives. Helen Boaden, the corporation’s Director of Radio who has responsibility for overseeing the Proms, ensured tickets for five people including the pop star turned vicar Reverend Richard Coles, while Mr Harding hosted a further three, including Newsnight presenter Allegra Stratton.

The next most popular event was Daniel Barenboim and the West–Eastern Divan Orchestra performing a selection of pieces as part of a ‘Spanish-flavoured evening’ of music.

A total of 17 people secured tickets thanks to Miss Boaden and Mr Harding – who gave one of the tickets to his wife – at a cost of £1,021.22, although eight of these tickets – including for presenter Jeremy Vine – were complimentary, so cost the BBC nothing.

However, those who did have their tickets paid for by the corporation included former cricketer Michael Atherton, playwright Sir Ronnie Harwood and Rabbi Lord Jonathan Sacks.

Despite being one of the most vaunted events, the Last Night of the Proms, saw only a handful of complementary guests, with even one of the tickets being left unclaimed of the day.

However, for the 12 people who did attend – including Miss May and her Cabinet colleague Mr Pickles and former Archbishop of Canterbury Lord Carey - the BBC forked out £1,440 on tickets, £64 on programmes and £659.80 of hospitality.

Given his previous job as chief executive of the Royal Opera House, one might expect Tony Hall – who is paid £450,000 as the BBC’s Director General – to take full advantage of the chance to see some of the world’s top classical musicians.

However, he was only hosted by the BBC for the opening night and then hosted guests himself for two other concerts. 

The first of these was for a performance by Rufus Wainwright, which he enjoyed with a group of six, including Sir David Attenborough, Sir Kenneth Branagh and Doctor Who and Sherlock writer Steven Moffat, at a cost to the BBC of £858.20.

Violinist Janine Jansen, conductor Sakari Oramo, singer Paloma Faith, television presenter Katie Derham and Joey from War Horse were part of the celebrations. The BBC spent £6,993.36 on the First Night of the Proms

He then also hosted a further six guests, including Mr Vine, Miss May and Baroness Stowell of Beeston for the festival’s closing night.

Miss Boaden, who earns £340,000, was the BBC boss most liberal with her distribution of complimentary tickets, hosting guests at a total of 23 concerts, at a total cost of nearly £7,000.

However, over 120 of the tickets she handed out were to guests she did not directly invite. It is unclear who these guests were and who invited them.

Andy Silvester, Campaign Manager for the Taxpayers’ Alliance, said: ‘Licence Fee payers will be furious that the Corporation is using their cash to host politicians and celebrities in luxury boxes.

‘These kind of tickets for the Proms are way out of the reach of hard-pressed families chased for every penny by the Licensing Authorities, and it’ll stick in the throat to see the Licence Fee used in this way.

‘The BBC needs to do away with this kind of spending and focus on delivering real value, or sympathy for the £145-a-year TV Tax will continue to wane.’

A BBC spokesperson said: “The BBC Proms is the world’s largest classical music festival and a major cultural event managed and broadcast by the BBC and money raised from tickets and programmes goes towards the running costs of the festival.

“The BBC works hard to ensure value for money for its licence fee payers. The cost of providing this hospitality has been strictly controlled by corporate guidelines and the average cost was approximately £300 less per event than last year.”
