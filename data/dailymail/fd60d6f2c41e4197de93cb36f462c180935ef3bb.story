The Duke of Westminster claims his work in the Territorial Army is complete despite being due to retire soon

The Duke of Westminster has resigned as the head of the Territorial Army after a failed attempt to overhaul its image.

The 60-year-old Duke, who is called Major General Gerald Grosvenor when in uniform, called for the TA to be renamed Army Reserves in a bid  to shed its ‘Dad’s Army’ reputation.

But according to military sources, his campaign was defeated ‘almost unanimously’ by senior colleagues. Now, the Duke, who is Britain’s wealthiest landowner and worth £7 billion, has left the TA’s headquarters in  Andover, Hampshire, and his post as Deputy Commander, Land Forces.

He will concentrate on raising funds 
for projects such as the £300 million refurbishment of a stately home to
turn it into the country’s biggest rehabilitation centre for wounded 
troops and civilians. He has also resigned from the Commonwealth War 
Graves Commission to focus on the same cause.

The Duke, who was due to retire from his TA post in six months, said last night his ‘work was done’ after a  40-year career.

A
TA officer told The Mail on Sunday: ‘He was very frustrated to have not
persuaded his colleagues of the merits of changing the name from  TA to
Army Reserves.

‘To him, the name TA was out of date 
and demeaning to the soldiers who give up their jobs to fight in 
Afghanistan. He spent a year trying to push this through, meeting a lot 
of resistance. He is not a man to stand on  ceremony or give up easily. I
am stunned and disappointed that he has gone, but his record in the TA 
will be long remembered.

‘He
was promoted from the junior rank of trooper to major general and 
achieved changes such as ensuring part-time troops are paid the same as 
our day jobs when we deploy.

‘I would have liked him to have won the name-change argument because the name Territorial suggests all the TA does is defend home territory. Yet at any one time there are 500 UK reservists fighting the Taliban.’

The Duke’s final defeat came at  this summer’s Whither Warfare conference staged by the Ministry of Defence. He was told by senior TA officers that there was nothing wrong with the TA brand and the name should remain unchanged.

Undeterred, he changed the title of the TA’s magazine, Territorial Army Quarterly, to Army Reserves Quarterly for its most recent edition.

An editorial which appeared beneath his signature read: ‘The more observant reader will have noticed that the name of the magazine has changed. The debate has been going on for years over whether the Territorial Army should change its name.

‘In favour of the new name are those 
who say that the name no longer  represents what we do and that today’s 
TA is as operationally mobile as the regular Army. On the side of the  
status quo are those who point out that the brand is strong.’

The Duke leaves the TA at a time when it is being expected to increase its deployable numbers.

In theory the TA consists of 37,000 deployable troops but in practice only about 14,000 are trained and available for use overseas.

By 2020, it is hoped the TA will form an integral part of a 120,000-strong British Army, including 36,000 fully trained reservists ready to meet any challenge anywhere in the world.

The Duke’s rehabilitation centre at Stanford Hall, Nottinghamshire, is expected to open in 2018.

He is leading the refurbishment  programme at the Grade II-listed £6.25 million mansion which he has donated to the nation.

The Duke said last night: ‘I have served in the Reserves for more than 40 years and while I was due to have retired next spring, I have decided to retire earlier. As far as I am concerned, the strategic job is done and I have achieved what I wanted to achieve.’
