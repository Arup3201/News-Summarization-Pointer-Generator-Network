Christopher Nolan has said the sound was mixed in an 'impressionistic way' in Interstellar

Interstellar director Christopher Nolan has reassured moviegoers that there's no need to worry if they find dialogue in his three-hour space epic practically inaudible - because that is exactly what he intended.

The British director responded to concerns about poor sound quality in the £105 million blockbuster by praising cinemas for presenting the film just the way he wanted.

Audiences have complained about drowned out dialogue and muffled conversations, with an overbearing soundtrack that obscures major plot points.

But what they do not appear to have realized is that they were experiencing the 'impressionistic way' sound was mixed in the movie.

Speaking to The Hollywood Reporter, Nolan explained that he felt this 'unusual approach' to the use of sound was right for an 'experimental film' such as Interstellar.

'I don't agree with the idea that you can only achieve clarity through dialogue,' he said. 'Clarity of story, clarity of emotions - I try to achieve that in a layered way using all the different things at my disposal - picture and sound.'

As the space epic took the box office by storm, one commentator Tweeted: '#INTERSTELLAR premiere: can't hear > 50% of dialogue inc major plot points. baffling sound mix decisions by Chris Nolan.'

Another Twitter user wrote: 'Very difficult to understand dialogue when score swelled in @Interstellar at @IMAX screening tonight.'

One cinema in Rochester, New York, even went as far as to tape up notices around the box confirming that its equipment was functioning properly and this was how the movie was actually intended to sound. 

Nolan told The Hollywood Reporter that he likes to hear how his movies sound in actual cinemas so he makes a point to visit six or seven theatres.

I like to hear it out where people are going to see it, not just in the cocoon of the dub stage,' he said. That is something I have done for years, because everything we are doing is intended to communicate something to the audience.'

The director continued on to say that the movie theatres he has visited have been doing 'a terrific job in terms of presenting the film in the way I intended'.

He added: 'Broadly speaking, there is no question when you mix a film in an unconventional way as this, you're bound to catch some people off guard, but hopefully people can appreciate the experience for what it's intended to be.'
