Luis Suarez has the tendency to split opinion for fans and footballers alike. Whether you like him or not, there is no denying the talent the little Uruguayan possesses. 

However Barcelona team-mate and captain Xavi's mind is more than made up on what to think of the former Liverpool striker, who scored his first La Liga goal since joining the Catalans in July. 

Speaking with Spanish publication Sport, Xavi was asked what he thought about Suarez's punishment for biting Italy's Giorgio Chiellini at last summer's World Cup. 

Luis Suarez has scored just three times in all competitions since his move to Barcelona in the summer

Suarez picked up his first La Liga goal for new club Barcelona in their 5-0 win against Cordoba on Saturday

'Pharaoh' Xavi spoke exclusively with Spanish magazine Sport in Cairo about life at his lifetime club Barcelona

'It’s really unfair. If he had to be punished for that action he was already punished, but don’t take away sporting merits.

'There are elbows that have worse intentions,' he added.

With his cards on the table, lifetime Barcelona player Xavi was put on the spot when he was asked whether he'd prefer to be bitten or be victim of a leg-breaking tackle.

The former Liverpool striker was given a lengthy ban after biting Italy defender Giorgio Chiellini

'What’s worse? What has worse consequences? 

'The only thing is that with a bite you know there is intent whilst with a tackle they can do damage but the intention could be to get the ball.'

So what of Suarez's actual playing ability, forgetting the aforementioned baggage he brought along with him to the Nou Camp? 

'He has goals in his blood. I have said that more will come. He will start scoring goals,' Xavi confirmed.  

'He reminds me a bit, with his killer instinct to damage other teams, of Samuel Eto’o, that bad mood, that personality, that persistence.'

Xavi likened the controversial Uruguay international to former Barcelona striker Samuel Eto'o
