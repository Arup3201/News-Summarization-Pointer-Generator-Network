A rapping granny is dispensing advice and creating laughs as she entertains her grandson.

Marianne Brown, 63, of Michigan, often takes to YouTube to entertain her grandson, but her latest video is turning more heads than usual.

Ms Brown curses, raps about elves and bowel movements – but told the Daily Dot her diatribes have a purpose.

Just for laughs: Marianne Brown makes her YouTube videos to make her grandson laugh

‘There's a method to my madness,’ she explained. ‘I want him to grow up and be a grandfather who also has fun with his grandchildren.’

Ms Brown’s first foray into hip hop starts off with a bang.

‘You think you all know it, but you need to find – being a grandma will blow your f*****g mind,’ she rhymes.

The rapping retiree has been making the videos since April because she misses her grandson two hours away in Chicago.

‘He likes me, and I like him,’ said the kooky granny.

Not afraid to share the perils of growing old, Ms Brown then hits upon her physical appearance.

‘It explains itself, you just need to start to shrink and resemble an elf,’ she raps, adding ‘you fall on your ass, and if you’re very lucky, you pass a lot of gas.’

She even throws in a line about bowel movements before tackling her teeth and hair.

‘Did your hair turn gray, did your teeth fall out? My momma didn’t tell me, but that’s what it’s all about.’Ms Brown says she competed in the 1969 Miss America pageant, a claim MailOnline was unable to verify.

A message left with the Miss America Organization for comment has not yet been returned.

‘It tickles me when I see women with duck lips and big cleavage,’ she told the Daily Dot.

‘That's not going to last,’ she added, ‘I was in the Miss America pageant in 1969. I was a little hottie.’‘You can fight it, you can tight it 'till you taught, but that southerly direction cannot be caught,’ she espouses in the video.

‘Your only hope my sister, is maybe you are black, and every cracker knows that black don’t crack,’ she continues.

No worries: But growing old isn't the end of the world, she explains, saying she still has plenty of fun

Young at heart, Ms Brown told the Daily Dot of the fun she has with her grandson.

‘We're pretty much the same mindset,’ Brown explained. ‘His parents are in their 30s, and they're very serious; they're parents.’ 

‘He and I totally trash his room,’ she continued. ‘We totally trash it. And then they come in and see us, and I look like a really bad kid sitting there, and then I walk away.’

They tell me not to give him more than one cookie, and when they leave, I give him like 10,’ she said.

She told the site that she makes the video to prove that being old isn’t the end of the world.

Some of her other YouTube moments 
include 'A Little Message from the Tooth Fairy,' 'Menopause,' Turning 
S**t Into a Divine Gift' and 'How to Apply Makeup on the Elderly 101.'

‘You can actually have fun and make videos,’ she said. ‘You can jump out of airplanes. You can do whatever you want.’

And she’s doing just that.

Until next time: 'Peace out'
