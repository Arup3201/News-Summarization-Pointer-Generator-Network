 A serial luggage thief has been banned from all London airports for 10 years.

Juan Carlos Yanez, 59, who stole bags from several airports was sentenced to three years in jail and also given a 10-year Asbo prohibiting him from Heathrow, City Airport, Gatwick, Luton and Stansted.

Canadian national Yanez, of no fixed abode, had been arrested in Terminal 4 at Heathrow on June 5 following an investigation by officers from SO18, Scotland Yard's Aviation Security unit.

 Juan Carlos Yanez, 59, a Canadian national, of no fixed abode was also given a 10-year Asbo prohibiting him from all London airports (Heathrow, City, Gatwick, Luton and Stansted)

Yanez was a frequent visitor to Britain and would travel to Heathrow on express and tube trains, dressed casually and carrying a shoulder bag inside which he carried a change of clothes, hats and glasses so he could change his appearance to evade capture via CCTV cameras.

He would identify departing passengers, mainly women, who were travelling alone and in possession of expensive designer bags.

Yanez watched them until they were distracted by the check-in procedure at the counter, or using the self-check in terminals or if they were in the re-packing area due to excess baggage allowance. He would then steal their bags.

An extensive review of CCTV was carried out and an image of the then unidentified Yanez was circulated around all British airports and across Europe.

Authorities in Paris, France, identified him as Juan Carlos Yanez where he held a conviction for a similar offence. Yanez was then circulated as wanted by police at Heathrow.

Yanez was spotted in Heathrow's Terminal 4 departures building on June 5 by Special Constables on duty with the Heathrow Bag Theft Team and arrested.

He appeared in custody at Uxbridge Magistrates' Court the following day charged with eight counts of theft committed at Heathrow from August 14, 2012, to June 3 this year.

Yanez pleaded guilty at Isleworth Crown Court on June 26 to six of the eight offences. Three further offences - two at Gatwick Airport and one at Stansted - were taken into consideration.
