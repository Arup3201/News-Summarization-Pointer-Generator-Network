A child of three was found wandering the streets alone after walking out of his nursery school.

Tamimul Islam is believed to have been by himself for up to an hour before a woman driving past found him and returned him to his family.

The toddler
told the woman he wanted to go home rather than back to St Hilda's Primary in Oldham, Greater Manchester, which he had only attended for a few days.

His shocked father, Khairul Islam, said: 'A lady who was driving saw my son 
walking by himself. She followed him and asked him where he was going. 
The family is still shocked.

'When I saw him at 1.45pm in my house, I didn¹t know what to say.

Investigation: Gillian Pursey, head of St Hilda's in Oldham, pictured, said disciplinary action may be taken

‘Anything could have happened to him and the school couldn’t explain what happened.’

Tamimul’s aunt, who did not want to be named, said: ‘People should have been watching him and guarding the main entrance to make sure that no child could get out.

'We cannot be sure how long he was outside the school on his own but it could have been over an hour.

'If he had walked for a few minutes more he could have walked into a main road by himself and been seriously hurt.'

The school has apologised to the family and launched an investigation to determine how he was allowed to leave.

According to Gillian Pursey, head teacher at St 
Hilda's, disciplinary action may be taken ‘if appropriate’.

She said: 'We were extremely concerned for the welfare of the boy 
and we unreservedly apologise for the obvious distress this caused to 
him and his family.

'We are taking this incident extremely seriously 
and are conducting an internal investigation to find out exactly what 
happened.

'If appropriate, this could lead to disciplinary action to 
ensure it never happens again.

Scandal: It is the second uproar at the school after teachers allegedly went to a wedding in January but claimed they were at a training day. The incident was reported by a parent

'The welfare of each and every child 
here is our top priority and we will not hesitate to act if we find that
this situation could have been prevented.'

St Hilda's most recent Ofsted inspection 
in July rated it as good in all categories, including the behaviour and 
safety of pupils and leadership and management.

Inspectors said 'pupils say they feel safe at school and have confidence in adults to take care of them'.

This is the second scandal surrounding St Hilda's this year.

In January, a parent complained that teachers attended a colleague's wedding when they claimed to be on a staff training day.

Tamimul's case is also the second time a child has gone missing from a primary school this month.

Louise Hilton, two, walked all the way home from Windmill Nursery in Runcorn.

Arriving at the house, half a mile away, she knocked on the door and announced: 'Mummy, mummy, I'm home.'
