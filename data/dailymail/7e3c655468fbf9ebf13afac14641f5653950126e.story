Two armed men believed to be in their late fifties held up a medical clinic for a stash of Viagra this weekend, police said.

The pair brandished guns in broad daylight in front of staff and patients on Saturday at 3pm in the Austin neighborhood of Chicago.

According to police, the two men, neither one disguising their face, came to the center and asked to see a dentist.

Two older men who have yet to be identified held up a medical clinic on Saturday in Chicago and stole thousands of dollars of prescription drugs including a stash of Viagra

Once an employee opened the door, they pointed a handgun and semi-automatic at him and told him to get down on his knees with his hands up, CBS reported.

They stole 56 Viagra pills with a value of $1,700, Xanex, various painkillers and a codeine-laced cough syrup, according to CBS. They also stole a laptop and a small amount of cash from the employee's wallet.

One man was dressed in a brown shirt and stocking cap while the other was wearing a Tasmanian devil T-shirt and a leather flat cap. They were described as being in their late fifties and being a little nervous, witnesses said.

The entire hold-up was caught on the clinic's surveillance cameras.

No arrests have yet been made and police are asking for the public's help in identifying the two men.

MailOnline was awaiting for a comment today from Chicago Police Department.
