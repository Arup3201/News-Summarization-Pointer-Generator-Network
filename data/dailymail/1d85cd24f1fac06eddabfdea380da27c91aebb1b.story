While it's always good to listen to your feelings, women's tendency to follow their hearts over their heads means that men are far more decisive than women – and they don’t feel the need to ask for advice either.

When it comes to making decisions, men are twice as likely as women to decide 'right away'.

And although women take longer to come to decisions, and are twice as likely as men to consult their partner before making them, they are more inclined to regret their choices further down the line.

Which to follow - the head or heart? Women and men make decisions very differently

The research, commissioned by swimming pool builders Origin Leisure, asked 2,000 men and women to evaluate their decisions in life and found women are much more likely to consider the opinions of friends and take time on their choices, while men adopt a more immediate process.

A quarter of women said their approach was often to spend a long time mulling over the details of a decision before making it - but less than a fifth of men take the same approach.

When a choice requires a bit of soul-searching, women are more likely to do something ‘from the heart’ than are blokes results found.

Psychologist Cliff Arnall said: ‘There are stark differences between how men and women make decisions. Women’s significant reliance on others plus a reluctance to make a wrong decision points to a measurable lack of confidence compared to men.’

‘Weighing up different outcomes and scenarios may seem like a good strategy but it appears to be accompanied by increasing levels of stress and uncertainty. Going round in circles soon becomes counterproductive and leads to decision paralysis and feelings of frustration.’

The study also found a quarter of Brits find it easier to make really big decisions than smaller ones, trusting their gut for ‘life-changing’ choices like whether to buy a house or propose to a partner, but then agonising over things like buying new clothes.

Women spend longer on choices such as buying new jeans or shoes, and are more likely to consult a friend for advice

Cliff Arnall adds: “Heart and gut feelings operate at a much faster and more primitive level than regular thought processes.

“The heart is based on emotion, the gut on survival. Gut feelings shouldn’t be dismissed as rash - 95% of the human body’s feel-good neurotransmitter serotonin is produced by the gut.”

Seven in ten of us are prone to making bad decisions and more than half of the participants felt they were indecisive.

Women are more likely than men to change their minds, and deliberate more over everything from whether to go on holiday or hand in notice at work, suffering the most back and forth on decisions around changing the look of their house or re-decorating.

However, men showed more indecision than the fairer sex when it came to putting an offer in for a house, talking to someone they find attractive or deciding whether or not to ask a partner to move in.

When thinking about the big decisions in their lives so far women cited starting a family as the biggest they’d made, while men chose buying a property.

Interestingly, women were more likely than men to feel they get the smaller decisions wrong in life while men are most likely to feel they get big decisions wrong.

But there are certain decisions we all make on the spot; one in five people in relationships knew they wanted to be with their partner within minutes of meeting.

Men know sooner after meeting someone if they want to be in a relationship with that person, with 41 per cent making up their minds on the same day, compared to less than a third of women.

And a third of homeowners knew their current property was for them almost instantly upon viewing it.

So as long as we know what we want in our love life and home life, we should be alright.
