The return of opaque tights and boots can only mean one thing - the sniffles season is upon us.

The rows of shelf space once devoted to sun cream are now being replaced by tissues, decongestants and emergency dosages of vitamin C.

We're always being told a healthy diet helps to support our immune systems, but with the relentless bombardment of so many apparently conflicting health messages, it can be difficult to know where to begin.

The key to a strong immune system, according to Dr Fuhrman, lies in micronutrients present in abundance in certain vegetables and fruit

But eminent doctor and nutritionist Dr Joel Fuhrman believes he has come up with a definitive two-week immunity-boosting diet that supports the body's natural defences. He claims it also makes you feel so good that you’ll want to incorporate it into your daily life.

Not only will such a plan turbo-charge your chances of staying cold-free but, according to the doctor, will boost your defences against far more sinister health conditions - even cancer - and could also help you lose weight.

The key, according to Dr Fuhrman, lies in micronutrients present in abundance in certain vegetables and fruit.

It is these micronutrients (the catch-all term for the vitamins and minerals that are vital to the body but only needed in small quantities) that, when eaten in specific combinations, play a crucial role in strengthening and supporting our immunity.

Foods such as berries and mushrooms are an important part of Dr Fuhrman's immune-boosting diet

He believes the nutritional inadequacies of the modern diet have left our bodies struggling to fight off viruses and infections, resulting in frequent colds - which don't shift - and an ever-increasing risk of disease, such as cancer.

If you don't have a well-functioning immune system, mild infections hang on for weeks, and can evolve into bronchitis or sinusitis.

But with a strong immune system, Dr Fuhrman insists you should be almost totally resistant to colds and flu, your body fighting off the virus before it takes hold. Even if you do notice mild symptoms, you should be back to normal again within 24 hours.

Dr Fuhram suggests half your daily vegetables are eaten raw, to maximise the impact of their micronutrients, some of which may be lost in the cooking process

He blames processed foods - those rich in fat, sugar and refined carbohydrates - together with our meagre fruit and vegetable intake (only 12 per cent of us manage to reach the Government's recommended minimum of five a day), for leaving our natural immunity levels woefully compromised.

'The modern diet is grossly deficient in hundreds of important plant-derived immunity-building compounds,' he explains, 'which makes us highly vulnerable to viruses, infections and disease.'

It is the micronutrients in certain foods that he says have the most profound effects on immunity, and which most of us are sorely lacking.

'A combination of these compounds is far more effective than any single agent,' he says.

In other words, although a fresh red 
pepper may be rich in vitamin C, it's the other smaller compounds it 
contains that work with vitamin C and increase its health-giving 
properties.

This explains why fresh fruit and vegetables are more effective than a simple high-dose vitamin C tablet.

Dr Fuhrnan's new food pyramid

'These micronutrients are not optional. You cannot have a lifetime of good health without them,' he says.

After treating more than 10,000 patients over the past 20 years using this micronutrient-dense diet, Dr Fuhrman is convinced his diet plan is enough to achieve what he calls 'super immunity'.

'The human immune system can be supercharged to protect our bodies against disease,' he says. 'It radically reduces the risk of annoying minor infections, serious major infections and even cancers.'

The key lies in cleverly combining the most nutritious foods in such a way as to maximise their impact.To this end, Dr Fuhrman has calculated a nutritional value for the most micronutrient-dense foods available, and has created a unique but simple diet plan.

HOW THE DIET WORKS

The standard-issue British 'food pyramid' recommends that the bulk of our diet is made up of carbohydrates. We comply with gusto, happily filling ourselves up on pasta, rice, potatoes and bread.

Yet, with 22 per cent of Britons now deemed obese, and battling through three colds per year on average, it could be said that these guidelines are flawed.

Superfoods

In contrast, the super immunity diet pyramid is founded on vegetables - at least eight servings a day. Dr Fuhrman recommends that two of these eight servings should be made up of green vegetables.

He also suggests that half of these are eaten raw as salads to maximise their impact, some of which may be lost in the cooking process.

Once you've got your vegetable intake organised, the next most important food groups are fruit (six pieces per day), and protein-rich nuts, seeds and beans/pulses (such as lentils and chickpeas).

Studies show that the compounds found in nuts and seeds, berries and pomegranates are potently protective. Dr Fuhrman believes when they are combined with green vegetables, mushrooms and onions, they come together to fuel our body's self-healing and self-protective properties.

The ideal combination in any meal is greens, onions, mushrooms, beans and seeds, with berries to follow. On this diet, hunger isn't a problem - you are encouraged to eat three large meals a day.

Carbohydrates play a smaller role than vegetables, and should be eaten as slow-burn wholegrains, beans, peas, corn, barley, oats, quinoa and pumpkin.

If you follow the diet to the letter, meat, fish, eggs and dairy products should be eaten only in moderation. Although he says the ideal diet is vegetarian, even vegan, Dr Fuhrman is accepting of what he calls a 'flexitarian' approach, as long as you choose the best quality animal products (grass-fed meats, wild fish and organic or free-range poultry and eggs).

He regards sweets, cakes, biscuits and processed or fast food as 'nutrient-depleting', because the refined ingredients work against the action of the diet, suppressing your delicate immune function.
