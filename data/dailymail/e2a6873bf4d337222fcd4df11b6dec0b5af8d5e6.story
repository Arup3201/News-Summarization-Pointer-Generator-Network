Patrick Schwarzenegger was pictured getting a little too close for comfort with a mystery brunette while partying in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico on Sunday.

And the following day, the 21-year-old star took to Twitter to explain things were not as they may have seemed to be and he would never betray his girlfriend of five months, Miley Cyrus.

The controversy began as Patrick danced with and appeared to even hold hands with the mystery beauty dressed in nothing but a skimpy black bikini as they partied the day away at the Mango Deck Restaurant & Bar during spring break.

What would Miley say?: Patrick Schwarzenegger was spotted cosying up to a mystery brunette as he partied at the Mango Deck bar in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico on Sunday

Hitting back: As Miley's rabid fanbase lambasted him on social media, Patrick responded by saying the girl he was pictured with was a friend's girlfriend and that males and females could have platonic relationships

She appeared to be a friend of Patrick's from USC as she wore a headband with Kappa Kappa Gamma emblazoned on it, which is one of the sororities at the Los Angeles university he attends.

The brunette beauty was definitely comfortable with the son of Arnold Schwarzenegger and Maria Shriver as she put her arms around him while putting her face close up to his as they seemingly danced the afternoon away.

At one point, Patrick appeared to be taking a body shot off the mystery woman as he hunched over a female in a black bikini as he apparently put his lips on her skin while another man squeezed a lime on her torso.

The pair looked like they were worse for wear as they strolled along the beach arm-in-arm and even appeared to hold hands momentarily during the walk.

Patrick was dressed comfortably for the occasion as he wore a pair of blue board shorts with sharks printed all over them, a white fedora and a navy T-shirt tied around his neck.

The sorority girl did not occupy all of the young star's time as he was seen chatting it up with another male friend as he shaded his head with the navy top.

Not seen on the outing as he frolicked on the beach with the mystery woman was Patrick's 22-year-old girlfriend Miley.

Patrick took to his Twitter on Monday to respond to Miley's loyal fanbase lambasting him over his close encounters with the woman with a series of tweets.

He wrote: 'Omg. It's one of my best friends girlfriend...'

Then he maintained that he would never betray someone he's in a relationship with as he tweeted: 'Would NEVER do anything against my GF.....'

Lastly, he clarified that males and females can have platonic relationships:  'Girls have guy friends and guys have friends that are girls...'

The trip comes at an interesting time for The Grown Ups 2 star as last week it was reported that he and his ladylove have been telling friends that they will get married some day.

Spring break: No doubt the model was in high spirits as he beamed while spending his afternoon at the hotspot

According to a Thursday TMZ report, things may have originated as a 'hook up' between the two but things are getting serious as the pop princess is trying to clean up her image in order to win over his mother Maria.

Miley and Patrick, who have been dating for over five months, have now apparently grown so close that they're comfortable seriously talking about a future together.

The couple even shared a cosy dinner date with the 59-year-old American journalist Maria on Wednesday night as she was dressed much more sensibly than her scantily-clad stage ensembles.

Hanging out: The brunette did not monopolize his time as he hung out with another male friend

Three's a crowd: His pal put his arm around him as the two shared a laugh together

The wild child is said to be trying to rein in her hard-partying ways - which she has mainly shared with Patrick in previous months - to help get Maria on side.

At first, it was rumoured that Maria did not approve of the relationship and allegedly banned her from attending the annual Kennedy Christmas party.

Terminator actor Arnold, on the other hand, rang in the new year with the boisterous two piece when they partied in Las Vegas and appeared to be on board with the pairing. 

All in good fun: The actor also hung out with a friend who had a marijuana leaf emblazoned on his headband

Out with the boys: Patrick chatted with his male chums as the brunette beauty did not stray too far

Shady: The Grown Ups 2 star chatted with his male companion as he covered his head with a navy blue top

Before dating Miley, Patrick reportedly dated another USC mate named Tootsie Burns. The pair were spotted on a few outings together including one where she and a few gal pals visited him at his Blaze Pizza restaurant. 

On Monday afternoon, Miley took to social media for the first time since the suspecting photos were released but opted not to personally discuss the matter.

Instead she posted a bizarre photo of her with a male friend as pubic hair was animated on their nude-coloured ensembles. 

Heating up: Though she was not seen on the outing, things are reportedly getting serious between Patrick and 22-year-old girlfriend Miley, as they were pictured together at a Pre-Grammy Gala in LA last month

Bizarre: Miley took to Instagram on Monday afternoon to put this image of she and a male friend wearing nude-coloured ensembles with pubic hair super imposed on it along with a long caption about how she's blessed to have the pal in her life, ending the message with: 'Feeling supaaaa blisssssed or maybe I'm juzzzz stoned'
