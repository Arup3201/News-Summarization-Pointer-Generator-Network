Spirit of adventure: Bear Grylls, who is Britain's Chief Scout, dredged up old documents on his grandfather's exploits and decided to fictionalise them

TV adventurer Bear Grylls has signed a £1million book deal for a series of novels inspired by the secret wartime exploits of his grandfather.

The explorer hopes the trilogy of stories about a fictional former Special Forces soldier called Dan Ranger will resonate with fans of classic spy thrillers.

Grylls, 39, who is Britain’s Chief Scout, said: ‘I think adventure literature is ripe for a makeover!

‘It is all about taking the reader on an incredible adventure and always surprising them just when they think they know where the plot is leading them.’

The father-of-three, whose TV credits include the hit series Born Survivor, was inspired to put pen to paper when he began studying forgotten family files which detailed the work of his late grandfather, Brigadier Ted Grylls.

Brig Grylls was part of a crack unit tasked with capturing Nazi scientists and their secrets before they fell into the hands of Stalin’s Red Army at the end of the Second World War.

Even at the 11th hour, Hitler hoped his scientists could secure victory with a new range of intercontinental ballistic missiles able to deliver nerve gas to American cities.

Government files declassified in 2006 revealed that such special units helped to ensure more than 1,500 German scientists were transported to Britain and America after 1945.

Bear said: ‘The role and memory of my grandfather will echo through the first three books. He led a group tasked to recover and secure Nazi technology for the Allies.

‘This was a race between the British and the Americans versus the Russians as the Cold War began to take hold, a race we mostly won.’

Grylls, an honorary Lieutenant Commander in the Royal Naval Reserve, said he was largely ignorant of his grandfather’s role until he made an extraordinary discovery.

He said: ‘I had found these old military boxes in the attic at home when we sold my grandfather’s house after he passed away.

‘What we found was amazing – bundles of old documents tied up with seals and the words Top Secret stamped across them. Old silk escape maps and orders and code booklets. But literally masses of all this stuff, meticulously put together and untouched since the war.’

Grylls, who is working on the novels with former war reporter Damien Lewis, said as they read through the material they quickly realised that it lent itself to a work of fiction.

He said: ‘I sat with Damien and we thrashed through loads of ideas based on these documents and some of the very credible conspiracy theories around the mass exodus of Nazi technology and personnel in the last months of the war.

‘Then we asked family and friends their opinions and each time it kept coming back to the same premise – truth is stranger than fiction.’

A central theme of all three novels is the idea that there is a modern-day conspiracy to raise Hitler’s Third Reich from the ashes.

Grylls said his own list of adventure heroes might be considered a little obvious.

He added: ‘The literary characters who have inspired me include Hornblower, Robin Hood, Phileas Fogg, Bourne, Flashman, Bond and Indiana Jones. I know that sounds a bit cliched, but if people are honest, I reckon I am not alone.’

Orion books, which will publish  all three novels, will confirm details of what it called the ‘seven-figure book deal’ today.

The first book in the series, Ghost Flight, will be published in May next year.
