Martin O’Neill says this summer’s friendly match with England is simply a means to an end for Republic of Ireland.

Roy Hodgson takes the Three Lions to Dublin on June 7, six days before the Irish face Scotland in their decisive Euro 2016 qualifier.

O’Neill, though, has played down the significance of England’s visit and prefers to focus his attention on the match with the Scots.

Martin O'Neill says that Ireland's game against Scotland is much more important than the England clash

‘England is (a means to an end) for me,’ he said.

‘I agree it’s a big match, but it’s not for me. The Scotland game is the be all and end all.

‘I don’t think we should overlook the fact that, for me, it’s a build up to the Scotland game. It will be intense and that might be a good thing.

‘But at the end of the day, if you want us to win a load of friendly games I’ll play the 700th rated team in Europe every single week and build it up.’

Roy Hodgson's side travel to Ireland on June 7 for a friendly match at the Aviva Stadium in Dublin

O’Neill and his team cannot afford anything other than victory against Scotland at the Aviva Stadium.

They salvaged a 1-1 draw at home to Poland on Sunday night thanks to Shane Long’ s injury-time strike.

Failure to win, however, has left them three points adrift of the table-topping Poles with Germany and Scotland also two points better off.

Gordon Strachan and his Scotland side are just above Ireland and the clash has been labelled as 'must win'

The team have been praised for refusing to accept defeat against Poland, but also criticised for again having to rely on a last-minute rescue act.

O’Neill said: ‘I’d rather get the first goal in the game and take it. We’ve been chasing some of the matches.

‘But overall I think the draw sets it up for Scotland. It’s probably a must-win game for us.

‘We’re still in the competition. It would have been a real blow to lose on Sunday.

‘But I thought we had spirit in abundance. We really cannot wait now for June.’
