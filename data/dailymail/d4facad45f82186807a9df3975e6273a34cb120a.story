A Roman backstreet used by some of the first Christians to worship in York has been found under the city's Minster.

Archaeologists discovered the paved street during construction of a visitor centre in the medieval minster's undercroft.

It is thought to have been used for several centuries and shows signs of having been repeatedly patched up and repaired.

The street originally ran behind the Roman basilica, the site of today's Minster.

The Very Reverend Vivienne Faull, the Dean of York, said: 'While it was not as grandly paved as the main streets of Roman York, you can imagine that this backstreet, situated as it was between the Basilica and the Praetorium, was exactly the kind of place where the real business of the empire was done.

'It probably even witnessed the very first Christians on their way to worship.'

A Minster spokeswoman added: "The backstreet was used for hundreds of years and was frequently patched and repaired, falling into disuse at the same time as the basilica itself."

Excavations were carried out by the York Archaeological Trust as part of the Â£20 million York Minster Revealed project.

Ian Milsted, the trust's Lead Archaeologist,said: 'Before this, there had been no archaeological excavations at York Minster for over 40 years, so it's a huge privilege to be revealing pieces of the past in such an iconic building, all of it contributing to our picture of life in ancient York.'

Paving from the street that once ran past the Roman basilica in York can be seen centuries after it was last used.

Roman York, then called Eboracum, was founded in AD71 was a major military and economic hub in Britain until the early 5th Century.

Analysis of all the finds made during the dig, including four human skulls that were unearthed last March, is expected to be published early next year.

The Minster dates from 1220 but the first church on the site was built in 627 for the baptism of the Anglo Saxon king Edwin.

The York Minster Revealed project is a five-year scheme designed to conserve and restore historic features while improving access for the public.
