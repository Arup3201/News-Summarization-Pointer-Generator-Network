With his rugged looks and stellar acting skills, Johnny Depp is the object of many women's desire.

So it comes as no surprise that, once again, he has been voted the sexiest actor of all time.

In a nationwide survey it was revealed that The Pirates Of The Caribbean star was the leading man of 
choice, sweeping 43 per cent of Brits off their feet as the sexiest actor.

But the poll found that it was his 1980s character that was the most attractive, with Top Gun star Tom Cruise flying into second place with over one in five 
votes and classic Hollywood gentleman Richard Gere coming in third place.

Number one: Johnny Depp has been voted as the sexiest actor of all time, but it's his 1980s character from the likes of 21 Jump Street that women are impressed by

Depp rose to prominence in the 1980s on TV series 21 Jump Street.

He fast become a teen idol but not satisfied with that status, he turned to film for more challenging roles starring in blockbusters such as 1990's Edward Scissorhands, Sleepy Hollow in 1999, and Charlie and the Chocolate Factory in 2005.

The survey found that the 1980’s was an iconic decade for film and gave rise to many screen actors who are still setting British hearts racing over 30 years later. 

It has been revealed that Dirty Dancing is the nation’s favourite 80s romantic comedy, scooping almost half of the votes, with When Harry Met Sally coming in second place.

Varied roles: Depp's roles have included Dark Shadows in 2012, where he starred as Barnabas Collins as well as Alice in Wonderland as Mad Hatter in 2010

Contenders: Tom Cruise and Richard Gere's 80s characters were also voted as some of the sexiest of all time

Other classic rom-coms that still have a place in the nation’s hearts include Cocktail, Look Who’s Talking and An Officer and a Gentleman – all featuring in the top five.

It was also revealed that it is the stars of today who Brits feel will still be popular on screen in years to come. 

Man of the moment Ryan Gosling was the clear favourite with over half of Brits believing he will stand the test of time and Ryan Reynolds came in second with nearly a quarter of the votes.

It's a winner: 1987's Dirty Dancing starring Patrick Swayze and Jennifer Grey has been voted the nation's favourite film scooping over half of the votes

However, it’s not only stars from across the pond that are gaining the votes, as home-grown talent Daniel Radcliffe was voted as the third most popular actor with staying power, claiming a fifth of the votes.

Cineworld Head of Film, Roy Gower, who carried out the survey, said: 'The 80’s was a fantastic time for romantic comedy films and so many from that era still rank among our favourites. 

'There is a real trend for nostalgia among the British at the moment.'
