Yorkshire’s celebrations of their first championship title for 13 years were thrown into disarray tonight when their captain Andrew Gale became the first county cricketer accused of using racial language on the field.

The newly crowned champions immediately vowed to fight to clear the name of Gale, who is accused of abusing Lancashire’s Ashwell Prince towards the end of the third day of an acrimonious Roses match on September 3.

It became clear that Gale was facing more than just a dissent charge when he was banned by the ECB not just for two games but also from taking any part in the presentation of the championship trophy at Trent Bridge last week.

And Yorkshire’s worst fears were confirmed last night when it emerged that Gale would be summoned to a disciplinary hearing in London next week on a Level Three or even Level Four charge for racial verbal abuse.

The charge will hinge on exactly what Gale, an inspirational captain for Yorkshire, said to the South African in a highly charged passage of play at Old Trafford which opened old wounds between fierce Roses rivals.

Sportsmail understands that Prince told Gale to ‘f*** off back to your fielding position’ when the Yorkshire captain was attempting to squeeze in one more over towards the end of play in a push for victory.

Gale then told Prince to ‘f*** off back to your own country you Kolpak f*****’ which Yorkshire are adamant should not be treated as racist and are preparing a legal case to defend their captain against the ECB next week.

The Kolpak regulation refers to Prince’s status as a non-overseas player, a restraint of trade ruling successfully overturned in the European courts by Slovakian handball player Maros Kolpak, but it is whether ‘go back to your own country’ is interpreted as racist that holds the key to this explosive matter.

Yorkshire will ask the hearing whether the same charge would have been brought had the same words been used against a white South African, but the ECB are determined to take a stand against what they see as a serious matter.

It was the governing body who took the matter to its own Cricket Discipline Commission after umpires Steve Garrett and Steve O’Shaughnessy reported Gale for a Level Two offence under the ECB code of conduct for using ‘language or gesture that is obscene or of a serious insulting nature to another player, umpire, referee, team official or spectator.’

Gale had been disciplined for dissent earlier in the season, which meant that the latest charge triggered a two-match ban that ruled him out for the championship decider against Notts But it is the escalating of the accusation which has turned it into a far more serious matter.

It was a Level Three charge that was originally thrown at England’s Jimmy Anderson after he clashed with India’s Ravindra Jadeja during the first Test even though there was no suggestion in that case of any racist abuse but it was thrown out through a lack of evidence by the International Cricket Council.

Now it is the Yorkshire and former England Lions captain who finds his reputation on the line over the interpretation of words that both he and his county are adamant should not be construed as racist.

The ECB, who were criticised for not allowing gale to collect the trophy on Yorkshire’s behalf last week, are clearly determined to make an example of a county captain who is no stranger to charges of dissent.

Yet there will be those who accuse the ECB of double-standards because they were so reluctant to become involved when Moeen Ali was booed by Indian supporters at Edgbaston in what appeared to be racist abuse of the England all-rounder’s Pakistani heritage.

Gale was expected to parade the championship trophy in front of Yorkshire fans at Headingley next week during their final match of the season against Somerset. Instead he will be fighting to salvage his reputation.
