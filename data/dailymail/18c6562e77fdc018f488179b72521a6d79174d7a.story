Roma defender Leandro Castan has had neurosurgery that successfully removed a malformation on his brain, the club have said.

Castan has been out of action since a September victory at Empoli, where he was substituted at halftime because of dizziness.

Roma said the malformation, known as a cavernoma, measured just over an inch, and was 'completely removed' during a three and a half hour surgery.

The club added that Castan woke up after the procedure and was breathing unaided. However, he will remain in intensive care for 24 hours.

The 28-year-old center back joined Roma in 2012 from Corinthians in his native Brazil.

In the last two seasons, Castan played in 66 of Roma's 76 Serie A matches.
