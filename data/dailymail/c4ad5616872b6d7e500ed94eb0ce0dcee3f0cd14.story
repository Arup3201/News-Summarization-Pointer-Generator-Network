A tin of biscuits and a pint of milk were both reported stolen from police stations as officers repeatedly filed crime reports for their own missing possessions.

Other items which were supposedly stolen from police stations in Devon and Cornwall included make-up, phone chargers, a torch and £2 in cash.

Police filed the bizarre reports at the same time as being called to deal with around 100 genuine thefts a day.

Officers at the Heavitree police station in Exeter reported in February 2012 that a tin of biscuits had been stolen from the premises.

In another incident that year, police claimed that a pint of skimmed milk had been stolen from a station.

Precise details of the alleged theft are unclear, but it is thought that officers suspected a colleague of taking the milk without asking.

The bottle apparently had a set of initials written on its lid in an attempt to deter thieves - but without success.

The crime is officially classified as unsolved.

Following a Freedom of Information request, Devon and Cornwall Police revealed that 18 thefts from police stations were officially logged as crimes between 2010 and 2013.

Among the items which have gone missing from the force's premises were two phone charges, a dress, a designer coat and a gym belt.

Toiletries were also a popular target for thieves, with perfume, eyeliner, foundation and aftershave listed among the stolen items.

A gift card was also reported missing from one station, as were two pound coins.

None of these items were ever recovered - the only thing which went missing from a station and was then found was a car's number plate.

When they were not dealing with the loss of officers' own possessions, Devon and Cornwall Police received reports of more than 35,000 thefts in the year to June 2013, and nearly 85,000 total crimes.

A spokesman for the force said: 'We encourage all staff to report thefts regardless of value, of which there are only a very small number as you would expect.

'In the spirit of openness and transparency these details are recorded and made available to the public through Freedom of Information requests.'
