Fall: Lalula Snook was allegedly knocked unconscious after slipping on the new floor of the swimming pool at Cleethorpes Leisure Centre

A multi-million pound swimming pool has been forced to close within days of opening after a three-year-old girl was allegedly knocked unconscious when she slipped on the new floor.

The pool at Cleethorpes Leisure Centre in Lincolnshire was shut down after Lalula Snook fell over by the edge of the water.

She reportedly smashed her head on the ground and was knocked unconscious - leaving her suffering from mild concussion.

Bosses at the pool, which has recently undergone a £2.5million refurbishment, made the decision to close the facility on Sunday.

They confirmed Lalula's fall was due to a 'number of incidents' involving the 'slippery floor'. 

Today, the child's father Jason Snook, 24, said he had been walking out of the changing rooms holding daughter's hand when she slipped on the ground.

'We were walking really slowly and she was holding my hand when she slipped,' he said.

'She fell hard and was unconscious for around 20 seconds before she came round- but it felt like forever.

'She was then crying for 45 minutes afterwards.'

Mr Snook said a member of staff had given his daughter some ice and had filled in an accident form, before she was taken to hospital by ambulance.

He added that he had witnessed several falls at the pool in the past - saying: ' I know that another girl had fallen and been hurt just before Lalula because her dad was filling an accident form in too.'

And the pool has not only encountered problems with its 'slippery floor' - with its new indoor waterslide also forced to close after cracks were discovered on the equipment.

Councillor Mick Burnett, deputy leader of North East Lincolnshire Council and chair of the group which run the borough’s leisure centres, said: 'Originally it was just the slide which was closed, but we have had a couple of incidents where the floor was very slippery.

'Therefore, we thought it would be best on safety grounds to close the swimming pool.

'Our subcontractor will be visiting the pool today to see what can be done to remedy the situation.

'I did hear reports of a child having been taken to hospital and all I can say is I’m extremely sorry and that is why it was so important to close the entire pool.'

The £2.5million refurbishment included upgrading the 'wet' side of the centre by installing a new slide, new floor tiles and a new unisex changing area.

Centre: The multi-million pound work was funded by North East Lincolnshire Council and Sport England

The transformation was funded by North East Lincolnshire Council and Sport England.

Steve Pratten, from East Midlands Ambulance Service, confirmed an ambulance had been called to the leisure centre at 3.19pm on Saturday and had arrived within ten minutes.

'The three-year-old girl was reported to have a head injury and was taken to Grimsby’s Diana, Princess of Wales Hospital for observation,' he said.

Lalula has since been allowed home after reportedly being diagnosed with mild concussion.
