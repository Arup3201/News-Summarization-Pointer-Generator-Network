Unsolved murder: Melanie Hall, 25, vanished after leaving a nightclub in Bath in June 1996. Her remains were found by the roadside in 2009

Detectives investigating the murder of Melanie Hall said today that a piece of blue rope and an old Volkswagen Golf they recently recovered could help them finally solve the case.

Miss Hall, 25, vanished after leaving a nightclub in Bath, Somerset, in 1996 where she had apparently had a row with her boyfriend.

Her remains were found dumped in a bin bag by the side of the M5 near Bristol in 2009.

Police said today they have received 'significant' new clues which may provide a breakthrough in the murder investigation.

Four years ago workmen discovered parts of Miss Hall's skeleton, including arm and leg bones, her pelvis and her skull next to the northbound slip road at junction 14 of the M5 near Thornbury in Gloucestershire, nearly 30 miles from where she vanished.

Police recently recovered an A-reg mark 1 Volkswagen Golf GTi cabriolet which is being examined by forensic officers.

Detective Superintendent Mike 
Courtiour, leading the murder inquiry, said: 'Over the past four years 
we have received information, intelligence and names that we have taken 
seriously, researched and thoroughly investigated.

'We have recently received information concerning the origin of the blue rope that was used to tie up Melanie’s body.

'It
 is significant information and we are actively working on that line of 
inquiry. We are working with forensic scientists in relation to the rope
 and the circumstances of where that particular length of rope came 
from.

'Also, we have recently found and recovered a car that may be relevant to events in 1996 when Melanie disappeared.

Discovery: Melanie Hall's remains were found by the roadside four years ago by workmen next to the northbound northbound entry slip road of junction 14 of the M5 near Bristol

Body find: Police work on the M5 slip road in 2009 after Miss Hall's remains were found. Detectives said today that they have recently made a significant breakthrough in the murder case

'It
 is a white, A-registered, mark 1 Volkswagen Golf GTi cabriolet which is
 currently being examined by forensic scientists. At this stage we do 
not know if it is connected with the case, but it is a very interesting 
and possibly significant line of inquiry.

'If
 anyone has any information about the circumstances of Melanie’s 
disappearance and her murder or can connect that car to what happened to
 her in 1996, please contact us and tell us what you know.'

Miss Hall, who worked at Royal United 
Hospital in Bath, vanished after a night out at Cadillacs nightclub in 
Walcot Street, Bath, in June 1996.

Probe: Avon and Somerset Police Detective Inspector Mike Courtier speaks to the press at Junction 14 of the M5 after the remains of Melanie Hall were found at the roadside in 2009

Anguish: Melanie's parents Steve and Pat Hall who today said police on't give up until they have caught their daughter's killer

Graduate: Miss Hall was a clerical worker at the Royal United Hospital in Bath when she vanished in 1996

A post mortem examination on the clerical worker's remains revealed she had been battered to death with a blunt instrument and suffered a fractured skull, cheek and jaw.

At the time the remains were discovered, Melanie's father Steve said he needed to know how his 'vibrant' daughter became a 'bag of bones'.

In 2003 police arrested two men in connection with Miss Hall's disappearance but they were released without charge after police searched buildings and a field near Bath.

Shortly after Miss Hall's remains were discovered, a man turned himself in to police in Greater Manchester, but he was ruled out after undergoing psychiatric tests.

In 2010 police arrested a 38-year-old man on suspicion of murder but he was subsequently released.

The fresh appeal by detectives has been welcomed by Miss Hall’s family, who issued a plea for anyone with information to come forward.

Her elder sister Dominique said: 'We have always been hopeful that someone would be brought to justice and that we would find out the details of what happened to Melanie.

'It won’t make the future any different - there will never be closure for our family - but it would be a great consolation if someone would search their conscience and come forward to police with that vital information we need.'

Melanie Hall's father Steve said he and his wife Pat have kept their daughter's ashes in a box by their fireplace since she finally 'returned home'.

He said Pat clung onto the remains after the funeral and cremation four years ago and has refused to scatter them.

Steve, 69, said: 'I had assumed we would scatter them somewhere, but Pat has never brought herself to do that and I don't think she ever will.

'She has finally got her child back and Melanie sits in a box by the fireplace. To Pat she is safe, she is home.'

Steve, a former director and chairman of Bath City Football Club, said he has dealt with his grief by 'reinventing' himself after she went missing.

He became heavily involved with Bath City FC and started a new career as an artist. But he has also struggled to see his wife Pat, 68, deal with the loss of their daughter.

He said he had not realised exactly how difficult she had found it until Melanie's body was discovered.

Appeal: Melanie's parents Steve and Pat Hall appear at a press conference in Bath four years ago after her remains were found by the M5

The family's focus now is on finally seeing those responsible for her death brought to justice.

Steve said today that the family were pleased police had made progress with their investigation and had seized a car.

'This is very positive news. Gradually the pieces of the jigsaw are being put together to bring Melanie’s killer or killers to justice,' he added.

'We always knew it would take a long time, but these new developments appear very encouraging.

'It’s time for whoever has information about Melanie’s murder to come forward and bring this to an end - because it will come to an end eventually. The police won’t give up until they get a result.'

Mr Courtiour said officers from Avon and Somerset police were determined to solve the case.

'Bringing Melanie Hall’s killer or killers to justice remains one of our highest priorities,' he said.

'On this fourth anniversary of the discovery of her body, I can stress that the investigation is very much active. It has been, and continues to be, one of the most detailed and thorough murder investigations in the force’s history.'
