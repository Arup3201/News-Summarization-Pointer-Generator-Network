For 13 years, squatters occupied six Victorian mansion blocks in a prime
 London location rent-free, letting them go to wrack and ruin. 

But yesterday a two-year battle to evict them came to a head in an early
 morning raid that saw violent clashes with bailiffs and police.

Squatters and protesters supporting their cause set bins on fire and 
hurled yellow paint at policemen brought in to oversee the operation.

Homeless: Around 75 residents, including some children, were led out of the squats today following the raid

The protesters, who had gathered along Rushcroft Road in Brixton, 
south-west London, in anticipation of the raid, yelled ‘scum’ as 
bailiffs moved in, while a group of ten tried to resist police.

Around 75 squatters – including children – were led out of the buildings.

Police said two people had been arrested – one for criminal damage and another for affray.

Peter Piotrkowski, an evictee, claimed he was pushed to the ground by police officers as he left the building on crutches.

He added: ‘I’m going to be homeless now. I’m on benefits, £72 a week. I 
can’t find any place for that money and I need to keep some money for 
food.’ 

Rushcroft Road, near the centre of up-and-coming Brixton, was covered in rubbish and bins were torched as the authorities evicted around 70 occupants from six mansion blocks, many of whom have lived there rent-free for 32 years

A woman who pays £1,300 a month to rent her flat on the street 
described the eviction as ‘terrifying’.

She added: ‘I don’t think it’s at all fair that they don’t have to pay rent. It’s a nice area.’

Following the raid, obscene graffiti could be seen daubed on one of the buildings.

One enforcement officer said that the interiors of some of the flats were in ‘quite a bad way’.

Lambeth Council said it has received no rent for the 47 flats since 2000. 

Now the council plans to sell three of the blocks, which could raise 
£5.5million, while the remaining three will be used as social housing, 
creating 22 new homes for families.

Lambeth councillor Pete Robbins said: ‘We are taking this action because
 it is unfair on the thousands of residents in need of housing in 
Lambeth that a small minority are unlawfully squatting and not paying 
any rent or council tax.

‘We have been in regular dialogue with the occupants of the six blocks 
over the last two years, offering support and advice on how to find 
alternative accommodation.

‘We will continue to take this approach in order to help everyone who is affected.’
