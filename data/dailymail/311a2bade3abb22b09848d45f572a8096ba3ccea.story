Dominique Strauss-Kahn was the ‘King’ of the orgies he attended at glamorous hotels all over the world, judges believe.

The former International Monetary Fund (IMF) chief’s ‘central pivot’ status in a well organised vice ring is what has led to him being prosecuted.

Judges in Lille, northern France, have announced that the 64-year-old will stand trial for pimping, and he faces up to 10 years in prison. He admits attending swingers' parties over many years, but insists he did not know the women were prostitutes.

Former International Monetary Fund head Strauss-Kahn has been charged with pimping in Lille

But today’s Le Figaro newspaper quotes
judicial sources as saying that Strauss-Kahn was ‘King of the Party’ 
and knew exactly what was going on. Legal documents suggests that 
Strauss Kahn was fully aware that ‘the girls’ were being paid the 
equivalent of thousands of pounds for their services.

He even made an apartment available 
for some of the orgies – an act which was ‘a material act of pimping’, 
according to the judges.

At least two prostitutes have told 
investigators that they were paid to attend the parties, and that all 
those attending knew this.

Judges have dismissed defence claims that all of those attending the parties were consensual adults who did not exchange money.

Strauss-Kahn has said that he did not 
know what any of the women did ‘because they had their clothes off’ and 
all looked the same.

Richard Malka, Strauss-Kahn’s lawyer, 
meanwhile insists that Strauss-Kahn is at the centre of a ‘relentless’ 
campaign to smear his name, and that he would use his trial to ‘denounce
the absurdity and abnormality of this aggravated pimping complaint’.

Women selling themselves for sex is 
not illegal in France, but aggravated pimping is, and carries a maximum 
sentence of 10 years and a fine equivalent to 1.2 million pounds.

Strauss-Kahn is now formally under ‘judicial control’, which means he cannot leave France and has to report to police regularly.

It is the latest in a string of legal 
problems for Strauss-Kahn, who once faced accusations that he tried to 
rape women in both New York and Paris.

In 2011 Strauss-Kahn was accused by Nafissatou Diallo, a New York chamber maid, of trying to rape her.

Lawyers for Strauss-Kahn proved that a
sex act which took place was consensual, but Strauss Kahn was forced to
step down from his 500,000-dollars a-year job at the IMF.

Diallo then sued Strauss-Kahn, but the
two sides reached a financial settlement late last year, the details of
which have never been disclosed.

Last October, a French prosecutor 
dropped a criminal investigation connecting Strauss-Kahn to a possible 
gang rape in Washington DC.

A Belgian woman withdrew her 
allegations, and said she would not press charges, despite initially 
insisting she had been attacked by Strauss Kahn.

Strauss-Kahn also faced allegations of
attempted rape two years ago when Tristane Banon, a young Paris writer,
said he had tried to rape her in 2003.

But prosecutors said the case could not be pursued because of a statute of limitations.

Strauss-Kahn denied the allegations and has since filed a counter claim in France, alleging slander.
