If you’re hoping to make your fortune, it seems your fate may lie in the stars.

A new study suggests those born under the Gemini star sign have the best chance of becoming wealthy, while Scorpios are the least likely to succeed.

The intriguing find was unearthed by researchers who studied the star signs of the top 1,000 richest people in England.

While they were fairly evenly spread over the 12 signs of the zodiac, there was a higher concentration of Geminis than any other sign.

They represent 10 per cent of the group and include Sir Paul McCartney, Sir Tom Jones and Jamie Oliver.

All of them were born in early summer - between May 21 and June 21- but it is not known why this would be an advantage to wealth-creating.

The analysis was based on a preview of the 25th Sunday Times Rich List, which will be published on April 21.

Geminis topped the horoscope league for the third year in a row with 9.9 per cent of our richest.

But bottom of the pile were Scorpios, with only 6.5 per cent, The Sun reported.

They include Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich and Paul McCartney’s third wife Nancy Shevell who has a lucrative stake in her family’s US transport business.

Unusual: Roman Abramovitch is one of the richest men in Britain but he is a Scorpio

Capricorn was the second richest sign, with 9.6 per cent. Third with 9.4 per cent was Aries, then Taurus (8.9%), Leo (8.6%), Sagittarius (8.2%), Cancer (8%), Pisces (7.9%), Libra (7.8%), Aquarius (7.7%) and Virgo (7.5%).

Last year’s rich list was topped by steel magnate Lakshmi Mittal – a Gemini – who was worth an estimated 12.7 billion.

He was followed by Uzbek-born Russian oligarch Alisher Usmanov, a Virgo, who was worth £12.3 billion.

The 1,000 biggest fortunes in the UK in 2012 totalled £414.26billion, up 4.7 per cent on the previous year.

The list featured 77 billionaires, compared with just 53 in 2010. It also featured a record 108 women, up from 105 last year.

Ex-model Kirsty Bertarelli was the richest woman in the UK and has the star sign of Cancer.

Her position was thanks to the £7.4billion fortune she shares with her Swiss-born husband Ernesto - whose family made its money in pharmaceuticals.
