Increasing numbers of patients are being banned from seeing their GP just for making a complaint

Increasing numbers of patients are being banned from seeing their GP just for making a complaint, campaigners warn.

They risk being unfairly struck off their surgery’s list for reporting that their doctor has been rude or the practice has refused to offer them an appointment.

Some family doctors are even forcing patients to undertake a phone interview before booking an appointment to ensure they are ill enough to be seen. 

The Patients Association said there has been a surge in the volume of calls to its helpline concerning ‘dismissive’ or ‘disrespectful’ GPs.

The charity – which mainly deals with patients who have suffered poor hospital care – says the proportion of calls made to its helpline about GPs has doubled in just two years.

Members of the public are increasingly reporting being unfairly struck off a surgery’s list and refused any future appointments, it says. 

Its survey of 500 patients found nearly one in 20 had been removed at some point after having made a complaint.

Under Department of Health guidelines, surgeries must have a valid reason for striking patients off and have to give at least one warning beforehand.

Patients can be removed – or deregistered – if the practice deems there has been an ‘irrevocable breakdown’ in their relationship with their GP or staff. 

Unfairly refused: A Patients Association survey found that one in 20 patients had been removed at some point after having made a complaint about their GP

Last year the Health Service Ombudsman 
warned entire families were being struck off over trivial disagreements 
with doctors or even complaining that receptionists aren’t answering the
phone. One patient was removed after voicing concerns staff had lost 
her medical records.

Katherine Murphy, chief executive of the Patients Association says there should be tough sanctions for GPs and practices unfairly striking off patients

Katherine Murphy, chief executive of the Patients’ Association, said: ‘There is a shockingly significant number removed from lists after making a complaint. 

‘Even more worrying, there are many more patients who do not raise genuine concerns because they fear being taken off the list.’ 

She said there should be tough sanctions for doctors and practices found to be unfairly striking patients off. 

The helpline said that of the 8,000 calls it receives each year, the proportion concerning GPs doubled in the past 12 months. They now represent a quarter of all calls, up from 11 per cent last year.

One patient said before he was allowed to book an appointment the doctor carried out a three-minute phone interview to establish whether the patient really needed to see him. Another contacted the charity because her GP was ‘rude’ and ‘dismissive’. She was afraid to report this in case she was struck off their list.
