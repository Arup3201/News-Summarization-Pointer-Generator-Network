George Osborne has been warned he faces a blackhole in the nation’s finances after failing to raise the billions expected form income tax.

The official budget watchdog said the Treasury was raking in less money because although there are more people in work, wages have barely increased.

The Chancellor was told to expect ‘weaker’ revenues from income tax, forcing him to find the money from elsewhere as the coalition struggles to balance the books.

Income tax revenues have been steadily rising since the financial crash, but could fall below the £164billion expected in 2014-15

Income tax last year generated £154billion for the government and was forecast to hit around £164billion this year.

However, the Office for Budget Responsibility warns that the Chancellor is likely to be ‘disappointed’.

One major factor has been the move to increase the amount workers can earn before paying income tax to £10,000.

The policy has proven popular with voters, but it means many people finding work for the first time are paying little or no income tax at all.

In his Tory conference speech last month, Mr Osborne signalled that he would go further and increase the personal allowance further.

He said: 'To those in work I say this: where is the sense in taxing you more, only for you to be given some of your own money back in welfare.

'The best way to support peoples’ incomes is to make sure those out of work get a job and those in work pay less tax.'

But he also warned that there will need to be another £25billion in spending cuts to eradicate the deficit. 

The Tories and the Lib Dems have both pledged to increase the personal allowance further to £12,500.

Robert Chote, chairman of the OBR, said it would be better for the Treasury’s bottom line if those in work got better pay rises than more people finding work on low wages.

He told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: ‘Fewer pence of revenue [are] coming in for every pound of wages and salaries that’s generated in the labour market and that’s one of the reasons why the receipts have come in weaker.

‘Now, from the perspective of the public finances, that’s not particularly good news.

‘The Chancellor of the Exchequer gets more bang for his buck if wages and salaries rise as a result of people’s earnings going up than if employment goes up – and that’s basically because if earnings go up you’re taking more people into higher income tax brackets, whereas if employment is going up you’re perhaps bringing more people in at the bottom.’

Latest figures show that average weekly earnings are up just 0.7 per cent, less than half the 1.6 per cent rate of inflation.

Mr Chote warned that the prospect of wages rising less rapidly than expected and employment growing faster than expected ‘does perhaps suggest that we are more likely to be disappointed than to overachieve on income tax receipts this year’.

There has also been a sharp increase in the number of people who are self-employed, hitting the highest level for 40 years.

There are now 4.6million who are self-employed, fuelling the growth in the numbers in work.

But since 2008-09, average income from self-employment has fallen by 22 per cent.

The proportion of people who are self-employed paying no income tax at all has rising from 20 per cent before the financial crash to 35 per cent now, Mr Chote added.

However, the government insists it is better to have more people in work, even if it is on low pay.

Danny Alexander, the Lib Dem Chief Secretary to the Treasury, said: ‘The fundamental fact about our recovery is... that countries around the world look at the United Kingdom with envy because we have the fastest rate of employment growth in the G7, the fastest fall in unemployment in the G7.’

He said one of the being changes has been a sharp fall in youth unemployment ‘and of course young people at the start of their careers tend to earn significantly below the median income’.

He added: ‘From the point of view of the welfare of the economy, the welfare of people across the United Kingdom, having more people in work is the most important thing.

‘And it may cause problems but, frankly, it’s a better problem to have than many other countries in the world are facing right now.’

Labour's shadow treasury minister Chris Leslie said the warning from the Office for Budget Responsibility is a 'cause for concern'. 

He added: 'The Government is borrowing £190 billion more than planned over this parliament and the OBR is now highlighting the impact of low pay on revenues.

Under this Government we are seeing a growing cost-of-living crisis with the average wages of working people down £1,600 year since the election, and George Osborne's attempt to offer unfunded pie-in-the-sky tax cuts at some point in the future won't mask the fact that his failure on deficit reduction means he has chosen to hit millions of working families with a strivers' tax that will cost many families up to £500 a year.'
