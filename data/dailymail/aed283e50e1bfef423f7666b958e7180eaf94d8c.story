Police are looking for the owner of a prosthetic limb after the abandoned arm was found in the car park of a Perth casino last month.

Kensington Police tweeted a photo of the brown plastic limb, with an Adidas sweat band, on Wednesday appealing for the owner to come forward.

The prosthetic limb was found in the Crown Casino car park on May 13 but police efforts to return it have so far failed.

'A prosthetic arm has been handed into Kensington. If this is yours or you know someone who is armless contact us #nojoke #weareserious,' police tweeted last month.

They renewed their appeal for the arm's owner on Wednesday.

'Hard to believe nobody has put their "left" arm up to claim, they must have had a spare? #NBA #Adidas', police said.

Lost property is usually kept for two months and is then either destroyed or returned to the person who handed it in.

Anyone with information should contact Kensington Police on (08) 9474 7555.
