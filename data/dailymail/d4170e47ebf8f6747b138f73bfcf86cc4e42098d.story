Votes: Justice secretary Chris Grayling today tabled a Bill offering three different options on prisoners' rights to vote

Justice Secretary Chris Grayling today raised the prospect of Britain defying the European Court of Human Rights over giving prisoners the vote.

Speaking in the Commons he repeatedly stressed the UK Parliament is ‘sovereign’ and it was up to MPs to decide whether or not to comply with rulings from Strasbourg.

Even if fines were imposed on Britain, MPs could decide not to pay them.

Despite Attorney General Dominic Grieve warning Cabinet ministers they could not take a stand against a European court’s controversial diktat, Mr Grayling insisted: ‘Ultimately this Parliament is sovereign, this Parliament can decide whether it will accept a ruling of the European Court - of any sort - or whether it won't.’

It came as former justice minister Nick Herbert suggested Britain should not try to accommodate the ECHR. 'We shouldn't defy the European Court of Human Rights: we should resile from it altogether.’

Today Mr Grayling announced a joint committee of MPs and peers would consider proposals for allowing convicts sentenced to less than four years or less than six months to participate in elections. The option of retaining the outright ban would also be considered.

Ministers will then 'reflect' on the report before allowing MPs to vote on one option.

Mr Grayling warned the financial costs of introducing the vote for prisoners 'could be significant' but also warned of the 'political cost' if Britain defied the ECHR.

'Ultimately if this Parliament decides not to agree to rulings from the ECHR it has no sanction,' Mr Grayling added.

'It can apply fines in absentia but it will be for Parliament to decide whether it wishes to recognise those decisions, as it is with all decisions.'

Attorney General Dominic Grieve has warned ministers not to express a view on giving prisoners the vote, despite David Cameron saying the idea makes him feel physically sick

Labour's shadow justice secretary Sadiq Khan said his party remained opposed to giving prisoners the vote.

He said if the government opted to allow anyone jailed for under four years to vote, more than 4,000 burglary inmates would have the chance to choose their MP or local councillor.

He added: 'The idea that depriving a prisoner of their vote means it's more likely that they will reoffend or less likely that they will reintegrate into society is absurd.'

Today’s draft Bill is published one 
day before the deadline to comply with the ruling by the ECHR that the 
current blanket ban is unlawful.

Last February, the Commons called for the blanket ban to be maintained by an overwhelming margin of 234 to 22.

Officials will be waiting anxiously to see how Strasbourg reacts to Mr Grayling's proposals.

It could yet rule the Government is deploying a delaying tactic and decide to start issuing compensation to inmates.

Former justice minister Nick Herbert said Britain should 'resile' from the European Court of Human Rights altogether

In the Commons today, Mr Grayling was repeatedly urged to stand up to Strasbourg.

Labour MP Jack Straw, the former 
Justice Secretary, said the ECHR had decided to 'extend its jurisdiction
from fundamental human rights into social and civic rights for which we
had not signed up'.

Tory Peter Bone said the British 
people would welcome Mr Grayling 'putting their views first, making this
Parliament sovereign and ignoring a Mickey Mouse court in Europe'.

Nick Herbert, a former justice minister, called for the UK to leave the jurisdiction of the ECHR altogether.

Writing
on the ConservativeHome.com website, he said: 'By bringing forward 
proposals for a limited enfranchisement, the Government may try to claim
that it has complied with the Court's ruling," Mr Herbert wrote.

'But
I fear this is unlikely to be the end of the matter. The Court also 
required the UK to "enact the relevant legislation within any time frame
decided by the Committee of Ministers". Yet it is virtually certain 
that the House of Commons will vote to retain the current ban.

'There's
another absurdity in what is being proposed. Ministers may in fact be 
unable to vote for, or even advocate, the existing ban - because to do 
so would breach the Ministerial Code, which does not allow them to 
advocate breaking the law.'

He predicted that the ECHR would start awarding prisoners compensation, and the public would find that even harder to 'stomach'.

'We shouldn't defy the European Court of Human Rights: we should resile from it altogether,' he added.

Sean Humber, a lawyer with Leigh Day & Co representing more than 500 prisoners seeking compensation from the Government, said: 'The Government is already facing claims for compensation running into the millions for refusing to allow serving prisoners the vote.

'Its stubborn refusal to take the necessary action is simply leaving it exposed to the cost of further claims.'

David Cameron and a string of senior 
ministers have made plain their disgust at the idea of giving rapists, 
burglars or any other criminals the vote.

But
Mr Grieve has warned senior ministers that they must abstain when the 
crucial vote takes place in the House of Commons in the coming months.

The law officer has also ruled that the Government must not ‘take a position’ in the debate by expressing support for a ban.

His
position is that any attempt by ministers to influence the outcome 
would heighten the likelihood of a full-blown confrontation with the 
European Court of Human Rights. 

Officials
believe the UK’s case will be strengthened if Parliament as a whole – 
rather than the government of the day – is seen to make the decision 
that prisoner voting is unacceptable.

But
it will create the farcical situation of the Prime Minister – who says 
prisoner voting makes him feel ‘physically ill’ – not being able to 
stand up for what he believes in the division lobby.

The
instruction is likely to heighten tensions between Mr Grieve and some 
of his Cabinet colleagues, who are infuriated by Strasbourg’s meddling 
and want to send a clear message to its unaccountable judges.

The Attorney General has repeatedly bent over backwards to accommodate the court or avoid incurring its wrath.

Mr Grieve is also under pressure for his refusal to intervene in the case of SAS soldier Sgt Danny Nightingale who was jailed for 18 months for keeping a pistol given to him in Iraq.
