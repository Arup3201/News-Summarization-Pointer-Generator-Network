Scores, if not hundreds, of people are feared dead or seriously injured after a 23-storey block of flats collapsed in North Korea in what officials surprisingly conceded was an 'unimaginable accident'.

It is highly unusual for the secretive Stalinist state to publicly announce negative incidents. But on this occasion the official KCNA news agency not only revealed the tragedy but also spoke of an 'intensive' emergency rescue effort being carried out to rescue survivors and treat the wounded.

Leader Kim Jong-un was said to be so upset that he had been unable to sleep.

Public apology: A construction division officer apologises to residents after the collapse of a tower block in Pyongyang left a large number of people dead

Just how many people have died or were injured in the collapse at an apartment complex under construction in the capital, Pyongyang, has not been announced.

However, an extraordinary photograph has been released which shows a construction worker apologising to residents.

The group of citizens stand quietly, some with heads down, as the official offers his apologies.

It is known that some 100 families had moved into apartments before the work was officially completed - a scenario that often occurs around the country.

The news agency did not elaborate on the cause of the collapse but senior officials have stepped forward to accept responsibility.

Among those who have offered a lengthy public apology is the Minister of People's Security, Choe Pu-il.

The agency said that Choe had 'repented of himself, saying that he failed to find out factors that can put at risk the lives and properties of the people and to take thorough-going measures, thereby causing an unimaginable accident.'

Tour guides accompanying western visitors always boast of how newly- married couples are able to move immediately into a free apartment.

'This is why we do things better than anywhere else in the world,' a guide told a busload of tourists on a typical visit.

'They get a free home and free medical treatment. We are very proud.'

The accident occurred late Tuesday and, said KCNA, was the result of 'irresponsible' supervision by officials in charge of the construction.

It is likely that those directly responsible for the building work will be punished with imprisonment.

In neighbouring South Korea an official agreed that it was common for people in the North to move into a new apartment building before construction officially ends.

He said it was believed 92 families were living in the collapsed building and the final death toll was likely to be 'considerable'.

Some 2.5 million people - most of them political elites who include senior party members or those with a privileged background - are thought to be living in Pyongyang.
