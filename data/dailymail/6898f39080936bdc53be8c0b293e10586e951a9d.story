A 74-year-old woman has been found dismembered in her California home with her husband, described by neighbours as a notorious cross dresser in the community, arrested in connection to the grisly crime.

Police say it was an overpowering smell pouring from the Oceanside home that prompted neighbours of Anna Maria and Frederick Hengl, 68, to alert them to the residence on Friday.

'About a week and a half ago, I noticed a pretty gross smell,' next-door neighbour Erick Chavez, 21, told NBC San Diego.

Grisly find: The dismembered body of a 74-year-old woman was found in this Oceanside, California home on Friday morning with the woman's husband arrested on suspicion of murder

Unusual couple: Neighbours of the couple say they were extremely strange with the victim frequently seen with her pants down on the street while holding a knife and her husband seen cross dressing

By Friday morning, it had grown absolutely unbearable he said, prompting him to report it.

Entering the home police discovered what remained of Mrs Hengl whom they said had been dead for at least one day.

Arrested outside a downtown bar was her 68-year-old husband with police questioning neighbours on possible power tools or heavy machinery heard coming from the home as of late.

'I just thought somebody was working in their garage,' neighbour Nancy Wells, one of several who confirmed such sounds told CBS8.

In addition to the loud sounds, Mr Chavez said Hengl had shown a particular attachment to his trash cans as of late.

'The
man was taking his trash cans back and forth,' Mr Chavez told News10. 
'He’s been going around the block, up and around, taking pieces of her 
and putting them in the trash; going around the block? I don't know,' he
guessed.

Tipped off: Next-door neighbour Erick Chavez, 21, said he alerted authorities after a horrible smell poured from the home for the last week and a half

Adding to his and others’ concern Mrs Hengl hadn't been seen for roughly a month.

It was an irregularity they said because of the kind of bizarre show she regularly put on for people on the street.

‘My neighbour was just telling me she'd chase her down the street with a knife or she'd have her clothes off, pants down; you could tell she was a little bit out of it,’ neighbour Brett Lord told 10News.

'She'd stand there, feed the birds, talk to folks walking by and her pants would fall. She didn't seem to notice, ever,' neighbour Jerry Parnell told 10News.

But her husband, whom she was described having a hostile relationship with, allegedly had his quirks too.

'The husband is actually known for dressing up like a woman and walking around the neighbourhood. It's just a permanent fixture, I guess. It doesn't freak us out anymore,' Jason Chandler told NBC San Diego.

Odd behaviour: Mr Chavez said that in addition to hearing power tools as of late, the victim's husband Frederick Hengl was seen frequently carrying his trash cans to and from the house, the backyard seen

In one instance a neighbour described seeing him wearing a floor-length purple dress coupled with a long pearl necklace and earrings. In his hand he held a purse, reports UT San Diego.

‘He would cross-dress and you almost couldn't recognize the guy,’ Mr Parnell said.

Hengl faces first degree murder charges and is expected to be arraigned on Tuesday.   

Police say there are no previous reports of domestic violence from the home though neighbours said they had made calls on Mrs Hengl in the past.
