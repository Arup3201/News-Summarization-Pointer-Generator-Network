Tragic: Keith Kirkum was killed by a lightning strike during a freak thunderstorm while kayaking near his home at Dengie, Essex

A spiritualist who believed life is controlled by Mother Nature died after he was struck by lightning while kayaking in the sea.

Keith Kirkum, 59, was out on the open water when he was caught in a freak thunderstorm.

When his body was found washed up on shore the following day it was at first assumed he had drowned.

But a post mortem examination revealed he had died from a heart attack caused by an electric shock.

His partner, Charlotte Kelly, 61, yesterday described how she was still trying to come to terms with the  manner of his death.

She said: 'This was such an unusual way to die, I just couldn’t believe it. I’m numb.

'He believed in the bigger picture – Mother Nature and the great beyond. I suppose you could say there is a sad irony in the way he died'

Mr Kirkum was described as a 'spiritual atheist' who began investigating various philosophies in his 20s. He met Miss Kelly 20 years ago and they worked together at home in Burnham-on-Crouch, Essex, on a website that sold books specialising in 'mind, body and spirit'.

Mr Kirkum drove his kayak to  Bradwell Beach, nine miles from his home, on August 6. His partner reported him missing that evening when he still hadn’t returned home.

A search of the area was launched by the coastguard, Essex Police and a crew from Burnham lifeboat station but it was not until 5.30am the  following day that a walker found his body washed up on the beach.

Miss Kelly added: 'To me, he was one 
of life’s good things. He was my friend and I will miss him every day. I
will miss his presence around me and how calm he was.'

Thames 
Coastguard yesterday advised people not to go out to sea alone on small 
crafts such as kayaks and to give details of their planned movements to a
contact on shore.

Watch manager Aimee Rampton added: 'There was a big squall which came through the area on August 6, severe 
enough to cause a problem even for experienced kayakers. Sadly, you 
cannot always predict conditions at sea, even when they appear benign 
when you set off.'

A Met Office spokesman said lightning 
was one of nature’s ‘most unpredictable weather forms’ and a single bolt
could contain a billion volts. He added: ‘Lightning is caused by a 
build-up of particles which cause negative and positive charges. The 
cloud acts almost like a battery.

'When it strikes, it normally looks for metal. In cases at sea, we often see stories of boats being caught in a storm.'
