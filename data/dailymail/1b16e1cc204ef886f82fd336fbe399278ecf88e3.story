A collection of the world's worst waxworks has been sold to a mystery buyer from the Czech Republic.

The anonymous purchaser is now the proud owner of more than 150 mis-shapen models of celebrities which once lived in the Louis Tussauds House of Wax museum in Great Yarmouth, Norfolk.

The figures - which represent both megastars such as David Beckham and minor celebrities like Eddie 'the Eagle' Edwards - cost £1,000 each to make.

Sold: Mis-shapen waxworks depicting figures such as the Queen and Prince Charles have been bought by a foreign collector after years on show in Great Yarmouth, Norfolk

Closed: Louis Tussauds House of Wax shut down in 2012 after years as a cult tourist destination

Obscure: It is not known whether or not the Czech public are fans of Eddie 'the Eagle' Edwards, left, or Samantha Fox, right

Royals: Members of the Royal Family, such as Princess Diana and Prince William, are among the collection

It is not known exactly how much they were bought for, but it is thought that they were worth up to £12,000 based on previous auction estimates.

The museum, run by Jane Hayes, 83, and her 86-year-old husband Peter Hayes, became a cult destination thanks to its bizarre exhibits but closed down in 2012 when the owner became ill.

After selling the waxworks to an unidentified Czech collector, the couple have now put the Victorian building on the market for £375,000.

They ran the museum together for 58 years, and lived a flat above but now plan to move out.

A neighbour said: 'I heard that they 
were all snapped up in one big job lot - possibly for another museum or a
 tourist attraction.

Icons? Cliff Richard and Paul McCartney as they appeared at Louis Tussauds

Icons: Kylie Minogue and Jason Donovan were depicted in creepy guises in the museum

Miscellaneous: Sir Ian Botham and the Duke of Edinburgh both received tributes in the museum

TV: Comedians Rowan Atkinson, left, and Michael Barrymore, right, have apparently gone to Eastern Europe

'All the models will need a bit of a makeover because most of them are very old. Maybe they will be recycled to become personalities in the Czech Republic!'

The waxworks were scheduled to go up for auction in 2008, with a guide price of £50 to £80 - giving the 150 items a total estimated value of £7,500 to £12,000.

The former museum, built in the mid-19th century as a doctor's house, is now up for sale with Howards Estate Agents.

A listing on the firm's website states: 'The property comprises a substantial building - 608sq/m - which was until recently used as a waxworks museum.

'The property also includes owner's private living accommodation, a pair of kiosks to the front which provide additional income and an enclosed rear yard area with parking beyond.'

Football heroes: Michael Owen and Paul Gascoigne can just about be recognised in these waxwork models

Unrecognisable: This pair of waxworks is supposed to represent Victoria and David Beckham

Dated: The collection prominently featured figures from the 80s and 90s like Frank Bruno and Jim Davidson

Band: The Beatles are just about recognisable as being Paul, John, George and Ringo

Musicians: Michael Jackson and Boy George were among the many pop stars in the museum

An answerphone message at the House of Wax says: 'Thank you for calling. Louis Tussauds House of Wax is now permanently closed.'

Local councillor Michael Jeal, cabinet member for tourism, said he was sad about the loss of the cult museum and its potential conversion into a home.

'Any loss of tourist attractions is a blow,' he said. 'We don't want to be losing attractions near the seafront or anywhere in these times of austerity.'

Mr and Mrs Hayes were granted planning permission to turn the museum into a home in December 2012.

They said they had been hit by rising costs and reduced income, and had been unable to find a replacement for their wax modeller after he retired several years ago.

Brits: Figures such as Steve Davis, left, and Neil Kinnock, right, may receive a bemused reaction from Czechs

Out of business: The building is now on the market for £375,000 and may be converted into a house

Dictators: Despots such as Hitler and Mussolini were given an inexplicable bronze glow

Showbiz: Light-entertainment icons Terry Wogan and Noel Edmonds were supposedly represented too

Guess who? This waxwork was supposed to represent Sarah, Duchess of York

The museum was named after the great grandson of Madame Tussaud, founder of the iconic waxworks museum in London in 1835.

Mr Hayes admitted in 2008 that some of his models were no longer recognisable.

He said: 'Some of them are too old and they do not resemble their subjects any more and obviously some visitors are far too young to remember them.'

In Yarmouth’s heyday in the 1960s, visitors had to queue to get in and went round the exhibition in lines of up to four abreast, he added.
