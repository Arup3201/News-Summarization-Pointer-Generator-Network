Nicola Adams wants to make history again. She was the first woman to win an Olympic boxing title in London two years ago, and now she wants to become the first female Commonwealth champion on Saturday in Glasgow. The 5ft 4in flyweight’s desire remains as strong as ever.

‘I want to be the first and make history and bring back gold for Team England,’ she said. ‘It’s a really, really big draw for me. I want to get another first under my belt.’

Women’s boxing make its Commonwealth debut in Glasgow on Monday, with Adams’s category the first of three events for female boxers on finals day next Saturday.

England’s Natasha Jonas and Savannah Marshall are also heavily tipped to win gold, but it is the smiling Adams who is attracting the most attention. The Olympic champion is the biggest draw in the entire boxing programme, men and women, something that would have been unthinkable two years ago.

But then Adams is now perfectly at home popping into 10 Downing Street (‘It’s better than it looks’) or visiting Brazil with the Prime Minister. She went up to her old boxing club in Leeds recently as she carried the Queen’s relay baton through her home town.

Adams marvelled at how a ‘small, Rocky-style club in a basement with one ring and maybe six bags’ had turned into a buzzing, thriving gym with 10 girls training regularly.

That’s the Adams effect, in a sporting landscape that has changed  dramatically since London 2012.

The female boxers are not being talked of as novelties in Glasgow, just athletes. They may still wear headguards, unlike the men, because they are simply not as powerful and, frankly, there is no will from within the sport to abandon them, but they are still just boxers here to try to win medals for their countries.

'F****** Chris Froome,' was Sir Bradley Wiggins’s opening gambit, delivered tongue-in-cheek, as he walked into a tent next to a bowling green in the shadow of Celtic Park last week. It was a particularly odd experience speaking to a knight of the realm as police snipers looked down from the rooftops of the neighbouring high-rise flats…

Dr Mike Loosemore of the English Institute of Sport has worked with British Boxing since 1997. Women joined the squad in 2010 and he believes they have helped the amateur sport change ‘beyond all recognition’.

He added: ‘Performance director Rob McCracken says we don’t have male and female boxers, we just have boxers. That’s the attitude  throughout the squad and they are all treated very much the same.

‘They all train in Sheffield four days a week and there are coaching staff, three physios, masseurs, nutritionists, two psychologists, two performance analysts, two strength and conditioning coaches, a physiologist and many more. I wouldn’t dream of giving out nutrition advice, for example — there is an expert for that.

‘Nicola is
 a remarkable athlete. She put in an extraordinary amount of work to get
 herself fit for the Olympics. You don’t just get given Olympic gold 
medals.’

But it will not be entirely straightforward for Adams, who faces Nigerian police officer Oluwatoyin Oladeji on Monday.

Away from the Commonwealth Games, Great Britain’s future stars have enjoyed the World Junior Athletics Championships.

Morgan Lake turned down a place in Glasgow to race in Oregon, where she won the heptathlon title by setting a world youth best of 6,148 points.

Lake is just 17 and still has two years to improve on that record.

The 31-year-old suffered her first defeat in almost two years in the quarter-finals of the European Championships in June; a ‘strange’ feeling that left her angry after her dream of becoming Britain’s first double  European champion — male or female — was dashed.

‘It wasn’t too much of a setback,’ she insists. ‘I had won the European Championships gold already in my career and the Commonwealths are my main focus this year.

‘It was disappointing but I can’t dwell on the past.’

The
 Commonwealth field is just 11 strong and athletes will only have to 
contest a maximum of four bouts, but there are still potential dangers 
for the Englishwoman.

Northern
 Ireland’s Michaela Walsh and Indian railway worker Rani Pinki, who beat
 five-time world champion Mary Kom to reach these Games, are lurking in 
the draw.

But Nicola Adams is only interested in finishing first. There is history to be made in Glasgow, after all.
