With just a month to go until the 2014 Victoria's Secret Show, the lingerie brand has revealed that this year's catwalk finale will feature not one, but two ornately-designed Fantasy Bras for the first time in the show's 19-year history.

Victoria's Secret veterans Alessandra Ambrosio and Adriana Lima unveiled the dazzling designs on Good Morning America earlier today, while revealing that they will be the models with the honor of modeling the unique bejeweled bras. 

'This year it’s really exciting because it’s the first time that we’re going to have two Fantasy Bras on the fashion show,' 33-year-old Adriana said.

'The sexiest night on television': Adriana (L) and Alessandra unveiled the bra designs on GMA earlier today and promised viewers an unforgettable show

Diamonds are forever: Each of the bras contains 16,000 rubies, diamonds and sapphires

'I’m honored to be here with Alessandra, doing the show, walking the runway together. I cannot wait.' 

Alessandra,  33, added: 'We work out really hard for the show so we may as well have fun in those beautiful, amazing Dream Angel Fantasy Bras... It's going to be the sexiest night on television.'  

Each of the lingerie sets was made by Mouawad jewelers using 16,000 rubies, diamonds and sapphires, all of which are strung together with 18 karat gold, and took the designers more than 1,380 hours to make.

But despite the ornate craftsmanship and the impressive array of precious gems incorporated into each design, this year's bras, which are valued at $2million each, are relatively cheap in comparison with previous creations. 

Last year, Candice Swanepoel modeled a $10million Fantasy Bra, while in 2011 Miranda Kerr wore was chosen to strut her stuff in a $2.5million set. 

The most expensive Fantasy Bras to date were both worn by Gisele Bündchen, who had the honor of closing the 2005 show in a $12.5million bra and the 2000 show, while wearing a $15million ruby and diamond encrusted design.

That lingerie set currently holds the Guinness world record for the most expensive underwear in the world.

This year's Fantasy Bra designs do mark another first for the popular underwear brand however, which revealed earlier this year that its hotly-anticipated 2014 catwalk show will be taking place in London for the first time ever.

Adriana and Candice made the announcement at the brand's flagship UK store on London's Bond Street in April, with Victoria's Secret managing director Ed Razek saying: 'Candidly, we weren't well known enough here until we opened the stores. We have six stores in the UK now.'  

Dazzling design - and a price tag to match: Last year's Fantasy Bra, modelled by Candice Swanepoel (pictured), cost a staggering $10m

The iconic lingerie and swimwear showcase has previously taken place in the likes of Cannes and Los Angeles, and last year was hosted at the Lexington Avenue Armory in New York City. 

While it was previously reported that tickets to this year's show were available to buy for the staggering price of $16,000 each, the brand has since confirmed that the show is a private event and as such will not be open to members of the public, no matter what price they are willing to pay. 

'Victoria’s Secret does not sell tickets to our invitation-only show and does not authorize any third-party agent to sell tickets on our behalf,' a spokesman for the brand told Fashionista.com in August. 'The only way to obtain tickets is by special invitation or through charitable contributions to pre-approved non-profit organization.'
