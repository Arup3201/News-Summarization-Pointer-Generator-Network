British interest at Queen’s Club rests with Andy Murray — and the Wimbledon champion has an extra incentive to deliver after two sharp volleys in his direction.

The Scot’s decision to appoint a female coach in Amelie Mauresmo drew a sly dig from Australian Marinko Matosevic, while Murray’s practice colleague on Tuesday, Aljaz Bedene, came under fire over his attempt to play Davis Cup for Britain.

On Murray’s new coaching set-up with Mauresmo, Bosnia-born Matosevic, who beat Marin Cilic  6-4, 6-4, said: ‘For me, I couldn’t (have a female coach) since I don’t think that highly of the women’s game.

Unconventional: Andy Murray has taken the bold step of naming Amelie Mauresmo as his new coach

Questioned: The choice of Mauresmo, a female, has been criticised by Australian Marinko Matosevic

Controversial: Matosevic also said he doesn't think much of women's tennis

'His mum (Judy Murray) coached him, and she did a great job. But it’s all equal rights these days. Got to be politically correct. So, yeah, someone’s got to give it a go, but it won’t be me.’

As for Bedene, British No 2 Dan Evans said the player should have his Davis Cup ambitions blocked as he is already ‘capped’ by Slovenia, although that didn’t seem to bother Murray on Tuesday.

Bedene, ranked 132 in the world, has lived in Britain since 2008 but represented Slovenia in three ties.

Evans, ranked 139, said: ‘He’s played Davis Cup for a different country so I don’t think it would be right if he played Davis Cup for our country. It’s like in football, he’s been capped for another country.

But I’d say I’m a better player anyway so it shouldn’t be a selection issue.’

Evans crashed out of Queen’s 6-2, 6-3 to Kevin Anderson. The South African was too strong and brutally accurate, breaking Evans in his first service game and then dominating him, serving 10 aces, compared to just two from the Briton.

‘I just didn’t get a chance to play,’ said Evans, who lasted 65 minutes. Fellow Briton James Ward lasted only two minutes longer as he fell to Bulgarian Grigor Dimitrov, who was cheered to a 7-5, 6-3 victory by his girlfriend Maria Sharapova.

Ineligible: Dan Evans doesn't believe Aljaz Bedene should be allowed to play for Great Britain at the Davis Cup

Talented: The Slovenian has lived in Britain since 2008 and is in contention for a call-up to the team
