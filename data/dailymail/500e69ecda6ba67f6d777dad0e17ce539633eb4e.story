A former Republican congressman has backed out of smoking a 'marijuana cigarette', but his refusal is apparently due to familial pressures, not political ones.

Tom Tancredo made a public bet with film producer Adam Hartle that the two would share a joint if his home state of Colorado legalized pot last election day.

That historic measure passed and Tancredo said recently that he would hold his side of the bargain. But now he's changed his mind, as his wife doesn't agree.

Former Republican congressman Tom Tancredo, center, spoke out in favor of marijuana legalization before the vote. But he's not reneged on a deal to smoke some pot as his wife is 'p****d'

'My wife is absolutely - she's p****d,' Tancredo told ABC News on Friday.  'Oh man, she is not happy.'

He also cited concerns about his 
grandchildren, stating: 'I am especially concerned that the publicity 
may cause my grandkids to have to justify my actions to their peers and 
afraid that no matter how many times I say I am NOT condoning the use of
marijuana, that that message will not get through.'

Tancredo spoke out in favor of legalization before the vote and was interviewed by Hartle for his film, Grassroots - The Comeback of Cannabis.

In the film, Hartle suggested to the ex-congressman: 'When marijuana 
legalization passes and marijuana is legal, the next time I’m out in 
Colorado, we’re going to smoke a joint together.'

'Deal,' said Tancredo, with the pair shaking on it.

And even last week, Tancredo claimed that while he had never smoked pot and that he wasn't condoning its use, he would honor the deal with 'just a puff.'

'Look, I made a bet with the producer of the film that if 
Amendment 64 passed (I did not think it would) that I would smoke pot. I will therefore smoke pot under circumstances we both 
agree are legal under Colorado law,' Tancredo went on.

But now he's changed his tune.

And it's not just because he has to answer to his wife and grandkids.

Tancredo has also revealed that his conservative associates also had their problems with his stunt.

'My conservative friends just believe what I'm doing is encouraging 
people to smoke it,' Tancredo said.

'I don't think people should. That 
decision is up to an individual. An adult, in this society, is not 
something the government should have any control over.'

Tancredo has had a controversial political career. In 2006 he described Miami as a 'third-world country' and in 2007 he began a campaign for president by taking hard-line stances on the issues of illegal immigration and terrorism.

At an event in 2010, he described President Obama as the 'greatest threat to the United States today' because the president's policies were undermining the 'Constitution' and 'our way of life.'
