Convicted: Waseem Daker, now 35, spent a decade behind bars for stalking Loretta Blatz; he was found guilty of killing her roommate

A man who became obsessed with a woman on his paintball team and proceeded to stalk her is now on trial for the murder of the woman's roommate.

In an unnerving twist, Waseem Daker fired his court-appointed lawyer so now he is the one questioning Loretta Spencer Blatz, the woman who he used to stalk and who was the reason why he spent 10 years behind bars.

Ms Blatz's former roommate, Karmen Smith, was killed in October 1996. Smith was found strangled to death and her five-year-old son Nickolas was stabbed multiple times during the attack but survived and will be testifying later in the trial.

Daker, who is now 35-years-old, met Ms Blatz when the two were on the same paintball team in Georgia.

They became close when Daker, who was then only a teenager enrolled at Georgia Tech University, began confiding in Ms Blatz.

'I felt like his bigger sister. He was reaching out and needing somebody. He told me he didn’t have anyone to talk to. I was trying to help him,' she said in court according to The Marietta Daily Journal.

Daker was 12 years her junior and soon after they became friends, their relationship turned more serious. While Daker is arguing in court that they were on-again-off-again lovers, Ms Blatz has always denied that version of events and said that he began calling her at the home where she lived with her then-10-year-old daughter 50 or 100 times a day.

'He would get extremely irate and say I was the only one he had to talk to and would kill himself if I would not talk to him. I told him he needed to seek professional help,' Ms Blatz said.

'The more I told him no, the more he was really persistent in talking to me.'

The Atlanta Journal Constitution reports that Daker is attempting to brand Ms Blatz a liar since a number of threatening instances that she claims against Daker- like when he allegedly threatened to slit her daughter's throat, tried to run her car off the road, or when he hung bras and underwear on her doorknob her for her to find- were never reported to police.

'Many things may not be on this report,' she said in court, unable to contain her tears.

'My intention was to get (the stalking) to stop. At the time I didn't know it would lead to what it... what it led to.'

Scene: At the time of her murder, Karmen Smith lived in the basement apartment of the house on Old Hunter's Trace (pictured) where  Loretta Blatz lived in Marietta, Georgia,

In an effort to cut him off, she and her daughter moved from Roswell to Cobb County, but that didn't end his unwanted attention.

'I walked into my apartment and heard my clock radio on. In my bedroom was Waseem Daker ... He was naked and he had a garter belt and garter hose on and was looking at himself in my mirror,' she said of one such incident.

Shortly after that May 1995 incident, she called the police and he was arrested, though she later dropped the charges after he promised that he would get help.

Months later Ms Smith, a Delta flight attendant who lived in the basement of Ms Blatz's home, was found dead. Daker was always listed as a possible suspect but at the time there was not enough evidence to charge him with the crime.

The next year, Daker was convicted of stalking Ms Blatz and spent the following 10 years in jail. Though he was released in 2006, it wasn't until 2009 when DNA testing was able to link Daker to the Smith crime scene when they traced several hairs on the victim's body to him.

One of the most intense portions of the trial was the cross examination of Ms Blatz by her convicted stalker. At one point, ABC News reports that Daker tried to have the judge label some portion of her testimony as 'inappropriate'.

'Well, you know, it’s really inappropriate that you stalk me and harass me, and you’re sitting here asking me questions, and I have to come back with you and answer your questions, that’s hard for me!' she said.
