Three weeks after the disturbing video footage taken on the Paris Metro which shamed Chelsea an initiative is gathering support among fans to fight back against the racists who still attach themselves to club.

Paris Saint-Germain visit Stamford Bridge for the second leg of a Champions League tie which will be forever tarnished by those Chelsea supporters who refused to let Souleymane S board a train at Richelieu-Drouot station as they sang: 'We're racist and that's the way we like it'.

Many Chelsea fans are keen to use the return fixture to send a collective message around the world, and have been inspired to produce flags, banners, posters and T-shirts to project the mood.

An initiative is gathering support to fight back against the racists who still attach themselves to Chelsea

Chelsea fans inside Stamford Bridge hold a poster saying: 'No racism at the Bridge. That's the way we like it!'

There will be posters handed out, printed in both English and French which state: 'No Racism at the Bridge. That's the way we like it.' There will be T-shirts carrying the slogan 'We Only See Blue' and there will be flag hanging from the Matthew Harding Stand bearing a message: 'Blues Against Racism'.

Souleymane has declined an invitation from Chelsea to attend the game but it is as if bearing witness to his experience, like something from Apartheid South Africa lurking amid the glitz of the Champions League, flicked a switch in the minds of thousands.

Rather than cringe and ignore the ever-diminishing faction of racists who have lingered around Chelsea since the 1980s – and other clubs, it must be said - supporters are getting active at ground-level with campaigns which has the potential to be more powerful than all those well-intentioned messages from the top of society.

Since the Metro footage went viral, another two incidents of racist abuse involving Chelsea-associated yobs singing on trains have been reported to police and are being investigated.

Ben Price, a 37-year-old gardener and Chelsea supporter since the early '90s, set up a Facebook page which he found gathered rapid support at home and abroad.

Paul Canoville, the club's first black player, was quick to back the movement, as was Richard West, aka Mr C, the DJ and former frontman for The Shamen, who is a Chelsea fan.

Price was responsible for the 'No Racism at the Bridge' posters on show during the Burnley game, last month, and will be outside the Shed End, handing out more before Wednesday night's game against PSG.

'It's a message that says that collectively we do not tolerate racism and we cannot be branded a racist club,' said Price. 'It's a message for Souleymane S and for other clubs and their fans and for football's authorities like UEFA and FIFA and hopefully we can send it around the world, because the eyes of the world will be on us.'

West, who flew in from his home in Los Angeles, said: 'What we saw in Paris disgusted 99.99per cent of Chelsea fans. I've worked against racism all my life. The Shamen were playing at anti-racism rallies in the early-90s.

'I DJ around the world, in countries as diverse as Russia and Colombia. Everything I stand for in my art and my music has been equality and unity and bringing people together.

'To see this happen to the club I've supported for 39 years and to Chelsea fans all over the world broke my heart. It killed me. I was depressed for days and I am Mr Positive. You don't get more positive than me. We sang about moving mountains.

'I was angry that these numbskulls, these drunken idiots, were dragging our multi-racial club through the mud. It hurt. And it tarnishes English football, not just Chelsea, and it is important fans stand up against this handful of people.'

Phil Keefe, who made one of the flags with his daughter Jodie, said: 'We talked about it and decided we had to do something. I used to come to Chelsea when the National Front sold newspapers outside the Shed. There is no way I want my club to be targeted again by those kinds of people.'

Chelsea have extended their Stamford Bridge invitation to Souleymane S after he declined an opportunity to attend Wednesday night's second leg. 

'I don't want to sit in that stadium next to those people who pushed me,' Souleymane S, who declined to reveal his surname, told RTL radio.

'I won't go. They can't buy me with a little piece of paper. I'm not a child.'

A Chelsea spokesman said: 'We appreciate he doesn't want to come to this particular game, however, our offer remains open and we hope he'll take us up on it so he can meet real Chelsea fans and experience the true spirit of the club.'
