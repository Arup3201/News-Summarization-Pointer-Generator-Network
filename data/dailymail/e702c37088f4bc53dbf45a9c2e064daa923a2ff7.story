Germany has blamed pro-Russian rebels for downing the Malaysia Airline MH17  plane with a rocket from a Buk missile defence system.

The BND foreign intelligence agency says separatists fired the device from a Ukrainian base which exploded directly next to the passenger aircraft.

It is the first time a European agency has openly pointed the finger at rebels, who have so far denied accusations.

The passenger jet was flying from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur when it was shot down over eastern Ukraine on July 17, killing all 298 passengers and crew members.

The crash has led to a further deterioration of ties between the West and Moscow, who are in dispute over Russia's role in the Ukraine crisis.

Gerhard Schindler, president of the BND, reportedly told a secret
parliamentary committee on security affairs earlier this month that separatists had used a Russian Buk missile defence system.

A German newspaper today quoted him admitting: 'It was pro-Russian separatists'.

The BND, Germany's equivalent to Britian's MI5, concluded separatists were to blame after carrying out detailed analysis based on satellite images and other photos, Der Spiegel said.

The intelligence service has not been available for comment.

European governments have so far refrained from openly attributing blame, but shortly after the crash U.S. Secretary
of State John Kerry said there was strong evidence that
Moscow-backed separatists had downed the plane.

The Dutch government, which has two investigations underway
into the downing of the airliner, has yet to say who was
responsible. Two thirds of the passengers were Dutch.

A preliminary report by the Dutch Safety Board last month
said the airliner crashed due to a 'large number of high-energy
objects' from outside the aircraft but drew no conclusions as to
where they came from.  

While Kiev blames the incident on rebels and has accused Moscow of arming them, Ukrainian security services claim to have intercepted phone conversations in which pro-Russian separatists appear to admit to shooting down Flight MH17.

The Security Service of Ukraine, (SBU) reportedly released recordings of the conversations between Russian military intelligence officers and Russian-backed Cossack militants to the Kiev Post.

In the calls, which were allegedly made minutes after the passenger plane crashed near the village of Chornukhine, a separatist can be heard saying: 'They shouldn’t be f*****g flying. There is a war going on.'

However Russia has denied any involvement and many believe the Boeing 777-200 was blasted out of the sky by Ukrainian military. 

Russian sources launched a scathing attack on the MH17 crash report published last month in a bid to undermine any future criticisms that it was responsible.

Several senior figures were given license to question the motives of the 'careless' Dutch-led investigation into the doomed Malaysia Airlines aircraft.

One suggested a Western plot to hide the real cause of the crash of the Malaysia Boeing 777-200, which among some figures in Moscow is blamed on the Ukrainian army.

Pyotr Deinekin, a former Russian Air Force commander and the chairman of the public council of the Russian Federal Air Transport Agency (Rosaviatsia), declared:'I was totally shocked by the data published by the investigative commission.

'Did it take them so long to find out that the Boeing was in good repair? It was clear from the start there would be no claims against the airplane's serviceability.'

He said accusingly: 'The Netherlands is careless, it draws conclusions before examining the plane's debris and body fragments.' 

Meanwhile, rebel official in Donetsk, Miroslav Rudenko, told Interfax alleged that the downing the the plane was 'a provocation carried out by the Ukrainian armed forces in order to discredit Russia and the people's militia'. 

The Dutch agency investigating the crash came under fire last week when one of the prosecutors revealed that an Australian passenger had been wearing an oxygen mask when the flight crashed.

The revelation suggested the man, whose name has not been released, had been conscious when the aircraft was struck.

Mr De Bruin said Dutch forensic experts investigated the mask 'for fingerprints, saliva and DNA,' but it did not produce any results, Associated Press reported. 

It resulted in a flood of phone calls to investigators from the relatives of the 298 passengers and crew who perished, including 38 Australians, seeking more information about the passenger.
