Staff from scandal-hit G4S are being hired by police forces to run murder and rape inquiries.

Senior investigators from the firm – ridiculed for the Olympics security fiasco – are even helping overworked officers on the Jimmy Savile sex abuse case.

Retired detectives are earning more than £60,000 a year in their new roles, on top of lucrative gold-plated public sector pensions.

Privatisation: Police forces are recruiting from G4S for roles running murder and serious crime probes

But the move has sparked fury among critics amid concerns that it is another step on the road to privatising frontline policing jobs.

Many high-ranking officers have been forced to retire as police budgets are cut by 20 per cent by Home Secretary Theresa May.

Police chiefs believe rehiring them as civilians ensures their experience and knowledge are not lost.

But it has led to concerns about lack of oversight because hired civilian staff do not have to co-operate with the Independent Police

G4S – criticised by the Government last year after 3,500 extra troops had to be deployed at London 2012 to plug a gap in trained security staff – is advertising for 'senior investigating officers' to work with forces around Britain.

Civilian officers will act as a 'focal point' heading serious crime investigations, leading teams of officers conducting interviews, door-to-door inquiries and tests.

However, they could not arrest suspects and will not be allowed to lead a murder inquiry before someone has been taken into custody.

Applicants must have managed murder or serious crime investigations up to the rank of detective inspector in the last four years.

G4S's Policing Solutions division will pocket more than £250,000 to hire staff to work on Operation Yewtree, which was set up in the wake of the Savile paedophile and sex abuse scandal.

The Met has a deal with a private firm, Reed Specialist Recruitment, which will pay G4S to hire retired detectives. They will work alongside 30 police officers in the Met's abuse unit.

Former Met commander John O'Connor said: 'It's appalling that G4S is recruiting for an inquiry of such a personal and harrowing nature. It's madness and an insult to victims.'

Other £30-an-hour jobs include a child abuse investigator to work  with Essex Police's specialist  unit in Laindon, near Basildon, and an intelligence co-ordinator in Hertfordshire.

A Home Office spokesman said: 'We support police and crime commissioners and forces considering whether the private sector can help achieve savings and better services.'

G4S hit the headlines after failing to fulfill its £240million contract with Locog to provide 10,400 security guards at the Olympic Park and other venues
