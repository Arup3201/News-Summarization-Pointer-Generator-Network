Just a year from today, Beth Whaanga went under the knife during a life-changing surgery.

It was a confronting and traumatic moment when the 33-year-old saw her own reflection for the first time.

Refusing to hide her body, she asked her friend Nadia Masot to photograph her scars to illustrate the devastation of her cancer surgery.

But when the images went viral, the critical reaction is what inspired both Queenslanders to do more.

Her intimate photos went viral and received worldwide attention and criticism. Many found the images 'offensive'

'I wanted those photos taken because I wanted to finally be comfortable in my own skin,' Mrs Whaanga told Daily Mail Australia.

'It was a traumatic change but I trusted Nadia completely to take a photo that will help my own healing process.'

The mother-of-four shared her intimate images to a selected number of friends on Facebook but was shocked to find that she was later 'unfriended' by more than 100 users.

The images were reported to Facebook administrators multiple times, some complaining that they found the nude photos of Mrs Whaanga 'offensive'. 

Despite the worldwide backlash, Mrs Whaanga doesn't regret sharing her images and is in fact working on a project inspired by the whole ordeal.

She and Ms Masot, 36, have been working together once again - this time photographing others with a similar story.

The Under the Red Dress project has about 50 others who like Mrs Whaanga bare their scars of cancer surgery. 

'Basically we wanted to show that cancer isn't just about glitter, galas, fun runs or pink ribbons,' Mrs Whaanga said.

'It's real and this is people's lives we're talking about. They go through horrible things and it also puts an emotional strain on their families.

'It's hard and scary.'

Mrs Whaanga, who's now an ambassador for the Cancer Council in Queensland, underwent her double mastectomy and breast reconstruction surgery on November 8 last year.

'When we found out that I had four lumps in my right breast it was a daunting and it's still hard for me to talk about the whole experience,' she said.

'But  I would do it again in a heartbeat. I have an obligation to my family and my kids so I know that I've done the right thing.

'The scars are now part of my body and it's a reminder to me of how lucky I am.'

Mrs Whaanga says her scars also keep her on track of her goals of raising awareness for cancer research.

And this time, her husband has also jumped on board the initiative.

The 33-year-old says she doesn't regret sharing the photos and hopes it encourages others to accept their scars

The Queenslander is now working on a project to help others with a similar story to share their experience

Maui, 33, is ready to give up his beloved dreadlocks of three years to raise funds that will help his wife complete her book of photographs for Under the Red Dress.

He will be losing the dreads at the end of the month.

'I'm so proud of my husband because I know how much he loves his dreadlocks,' Mrs Whaanga said.

'They're part of his image and persona and it's a big sacrifice for him to make.

'But cancer doesn't discriminate and we hope we can finish this book so that people can look at the photos and realise what cancer can do to people's body and their lives.'

The project includes contributors worldwide, the youngest being the age of 16.

Ms Masot says each individual has been photographed in a similar concept to Mrs Whaanga's images. 

'The book aims to compare and contrast images of each person with what the world sees and what has happened behind the scenes in their life and to their bodies,' Ms Masot told Daily Mail Australia.

'Under the Red Dress allows us to help people bare their grevious bodily scars of cancer and to help them find self acceptance, assist in the anti-body-shaming revolution and banish disease taboos.'

While the project is still in the works, Ms Masot says the experience so far has been humbling.

'I myself haven't had cancer but through this project I've come to realise that my trials are so trivial and it really puts things into perspective,' she said.

'At the end of the day, we just want people to accept their scars because they're okay and it just means that you're alive.'
