If you consider Matt Groening responsible for the wackiest hairstyles this side of Pluto, think again.

Models presented some exceedingly unusual hairdos at the 30th Alternative Hair Show, held at the Royal Albert Hall in London over the weekend.

But it seems with their their gravity-defying dos, hair stylist were indeed paying homage to characters from Groening's The Simpsons - as well as to industrial amounts of hairspray.

Some of the models' crops bore resemblances to those worn by Marge Simpson, Lisa Simpson, and Marge's sisters, Patty and Selma Bouvier.

Stylists exhibiting these larger-than-life creations at the show included Dmitri Vinokurov, Saco, Mario Krankl, TIGI, Mahogany, Pino, Dmitry Vinokurov, David Murray and Helen Reavey.

The
Alternative Hair Show, first held in London's Camden Palace 
in 1983, is a charity fund-raising event in aid of those suffering from leukaemia.

The first show drew £7,500, donated
to Leukaemia & Lymphoma Research, and since then the event has 
raised over £8.5m for leukemia charities in the UK, Austria, 
Italy, Japan, Russia and USA.

Founders Tony and Maggie Rizzo, who lost their firstborn child to leukaemia when he was two in 1983, said: 'Fighting leukaemia is our mission.
We will do everything we can to hasten the day when all children 
survive.

The 
2012 Alternative Hair Show - entitled Legends - also paid a tribute to 
one of the legendary hairdressers, Vidal Sassoon, who was global patron of the show.

To mark the 30th 
year of the charity event, Tony Rizzo, also a hairdresser, set up The 
Alternative Hair Charitable Foundation in January.He said: 'The 
foundation wants to build upon the success the Alternative Hair Shows 
have achieved over the last 30 years by establishing a focal point for 
hairdressing, a profession renowned for its qualities of caring and 
generosity, to achieve yet more in fighting leukaemia.'
