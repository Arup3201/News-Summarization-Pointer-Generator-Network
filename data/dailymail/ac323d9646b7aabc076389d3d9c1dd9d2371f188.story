An abandoned dog dubbed ET because of his hairless and wrinkled body has, like the loveable alien, finally found a home.

The terrier cross, who had been dumped in a park in Leeds, West Yorkshire., was completely bald with a severe skin infection when dog wardens brought him to the Dogs Trust.

It is thought ET had been surviving on his own for at least one month when he was discovered by a member of the public.

Home sweet home: New owner Mary Gledhill fell in love with the dog, who she has renamed Bobby, when she and husband Gerry visited Leeds Dogs Trust

Shaggy dog story: ET suffers from a case of inactive hair follicles, due to a skin irritation, which has caused much of his hair to fall out

ET suffers from a case of inactive hair follicles, due to a skin irritation, which has caused much of his hair to fall out.

Amanda Sands, Manager at Dogs Trust Leeds, said: "When he came to us he was very downbeat.

'Because he had little tufts of hair over his body and this really wrinkled skin he did look most peculiar and a bit like a cute little alien - hence the name.'

However, after a course of antibiotics, a few washes with medicated shampoo and some decent meals - ET started looking like his usual self.

Ms Sands added: 'After about two weeks he started getting better. It's amazing how quickly he responded to treatment.

What's in a name: Workers at Dogs Trust named the dog ET because of his tufts of hair and wrinkled skin

On the mend: After a course of antibiotics, a few washes with medicated shampoo and some decent meals - ET started looking like his usual self

'He is a completely different dog now. He's very handsome, so cheeky and so full of life - I'm so pleased he's in good health again.'

The loveable pooch was quickly spotted by retired couple Gerry and Mary Gledhill, who visited Leeds Dog Trust with their granddaughters Vicky, 28, and Gemma, 26.

Mr Gledhill said: 'We were all in the same room, but were looking at the dogs individually.

'When I came to where ET was, he was sat in his bed with only his head popping out.

'My first thought, even though I could only see his head, was that he was very handsome.

'At that particular time the staff were opening the kennel doors to give the dogs food.

New life: Mr and Mrs Gledhill said they would treat their new dog 'like a prince'

'ET obviously wanted something to eat because he was straight up to get some food.

'We saw his full body then and were immediately taken by him. It is hard to explain, but it was an instinctive feeling we both just had.

'We weren't bothered that he had problems, we just fell in love with him there and then.'

The couple then asked if they could take ET for a walk with their granddaughters.

Mr Gledhill, 76, who used to work in the power industry, said: 'We knew that any dog we got would be spending a lot of time with Gemma's German Shepherd, called Darcy, so it was important that they got on together.

Doppelganger: Staff at Dogs Trust thought the little terrier resembled alien ET from the Stephen Spielberg film

'Luckily they both hit it off and we all thought that ET was a fantastic dog on the walk. After that it was decided - ET was definitely the dog for us.'

Mr and Mrs Gledhill, 75, a retired care worker, picked up their new family member last Tuesday to take him to his new home, and gave him the new name 'Bobby'.

'We have had dogs all our lives,' Mr Gledhill added.

'We absolutely love them and we always treat our dog is well. He will be spoiled no doubt - like a little prince.'
