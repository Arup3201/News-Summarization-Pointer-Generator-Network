A mother caught trying to save her son from speeding points was jailed for two months yesterday.

Susan Sherwood, 49, of Luton, Bedfordshire, tried to fool the authorities that a friend she claimed was over from New Zealand had been driving her Honda when it was captured by an M1 camera.

She even provided the name of the man and his address in Auckland City - but they were fictional and the actual driver in December 2011 was her 24-year-old son Sam, Luton Crown Court heard.

Speeding: It was 10.20pm on December 1, 2011 when Sherwood's Honda car was clocked between junctions 13 and 12 doing 60mph in a 50mph section of the M1 in Bedfordshire, prosecutors said

It was 10.20pm on December 1, 2011 when Sherwood's Honda car was clocked between junctions 13 and 12 doing 60mph in a 50mph section of the M1 in Bedfordshire, Daniel Siong, prosecuting, said.

The vehicle was registered to the mother, and her son was a named driver. Contacted by letter, she at first claimed various people could have been the driver and she couldn't provide further details.

When she received a second letter she wrote back in January 2012 naming a ‘Mr Moderich’, whom she said was a friend from New Zealand, and provided his address.

She claimed she lent him the car while he was in the UK to visit people he knew in Northampton.

Mrs Sherwood asked in correspondence to see a photograph of the car when it was caught speeding, the court heard. It was late at night and the quality of the picture was grainy.

Judge David Farrell QC said it was mother ‘testing the water’ to see if it was possible to make out who was driving.

Mr Siong said police then tried to 
establish if Mr Moderich was a real person. Further enquiries with her 
insurers revealed nobody by that name was entitled under the policy to 
drive her car.

Vehicle: This is a picture of a Honda car parked in Mrs Sherwood's driveway in Luton, Bedfordshire, on her son Sam Sherwood's Facebook page. It is believed to be Mrs Sherwood's Honda car that was clocked on the M1

As a result of that, she was summonsed to Bedford Magistrates' Court for permitting a car to be used with no insurance. But last July Mrs Sherwood finally came clean about who had been driving.

She said she had subsequently discovered it was her son Sam who had been the driver. Last September the mother was arrested for perverting the course of justice.

Mr Siong said the prosecution accepted she had been trying to save her son incurring penalty points which would have affected his car insurance.

The offence had arisen out of a ‘mother's desire to protect her son’, Charles Judge, defending, said. He added that every day since the incident Mrs Sherwood wished she could turn back the clock.

Judge Farrell QC jailed her for nine weeks, saying that her that her case had been made worse by the persistence with which she continued to lie and the planning that was involved.

The judge said her offending struck at the ‘very root of the penalty point system.’ Mrs Sherwood, who pleaded guilty to a charge of perverting the course of justice, sobbed as she was led from court.
