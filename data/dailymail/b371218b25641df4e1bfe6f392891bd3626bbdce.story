Spencer Robinson, 36 was arrested after he allegedly damaged more than 30 headstones because 'he wanted to help the dead resurrect'

A Utah man was arrested after allegedly damaging more than 30 headstones because he wanted to help the dead come back to life on Easter.

Spencer Robinson, 36, told officers he  believed the tombstones would interfere with the deceased's chance to resurrect, according to police. 

When police arrived at the Payson City Cemetery on Monday they found that dozens of tombstones had been moved or smashed into pieces. Some had  been thrown over a fence.

Payson Police Lt. Bill Wright estimated the damage to be around $50,000. 

He said some of the tombstones were more than 100 years old and were probably irreparable, according to the Associated Press. 

Officers were notified that Robinson had been removed from the cemetery only days earlier when workers spotted him moving headstones. 

Police went to Robinson's house after they found his cell phone at the graveyard. 

A family member told them Robinson said he was going back to the cemetery to 'finish the job', according to Fox 13 Now. 

Robinson had told the relative he believed many of his friends would be freed for the Easter resurrection, according to police. 

Police then tried to arrest Robinson in his backyard, but he ran into the house and locked them out. 

Officers forced their way into the home and handcuffed Robinson after wrestling him to the ground.

According to officials, Robinson has a possible mental health condition. 

Wright said Robinson told police the tombstones were 'unfair and inconvenient', and that he was 'trying to help the deceased'. 

Robinson has been charged with damaging property, resisting arrest and criminal trespassing.
