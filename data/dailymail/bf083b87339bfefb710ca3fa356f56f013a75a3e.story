A Commonwealth Games weightlifter is due to go on trial this week accused of sexual assault.

Papua New Guinea competitor Toua Udia was arrested following a report of an incident at a Tesco supermarket near the Athletes’ Village in Glasgow.

Udia, 22, competed at the Clyde Auditorium at the weekend following the alleged assault last Monday.

He was charged under the Sexual Offences Act at Glasgow Sheriff Court and is scheduled to go to trial on Friday after pleading not guilty.

A Police Scotland spokeswoman said: 'At around 5.10pm on Monday July 21 police received a report of an incident at Tesco’s supermarket on Dalmarnock Road, Rutherglen.

'A 22-year-old man has been arrested in connection with an alleged assault.'

The Commonwealth Games Federation said it was aware of the allegation.

Speaking at a daily Games briefing, chief executive Mike Hooper said: 'A male athlete has been charged with an offence, he is due to appear this week in the court.'

He added: 'Clearly there is a presumption of innocence which we all enjoy, and so really there is nothing more I can add to that.

'It certainly didn’t impact on his ability to compete because there was no condition placed upon him.

'The reality is it’s an allegation that has been made, it is being investigated by the police, it is their role to follow through, and we do not interfere in their process.'
