A lottery winner who frittered away her £1.9m fortune on drink, drugs and luxury items is expecting twins - and she says the feeling is even better than when she hit the jackpot.

Callie Rogers, who was 16 when she matched all six numbers to become Britain's youngest lottery winner, is pregnant with two boys and due to give birth next month.

She said it meant she can finally live life to the full, having learned the hard way that money cannot buy happiness.

Rolling in it: Miss Rogers spent £11,500 on breast implants and posed naked for a magazine, with only banknotes to preserve her modesty

'I’m so excited about having my boys,' she told the Sunday Mirror.

'It’s the best gift anyone could ever have given me and far better than ever winning the jackpot.'

Miss Rogers, who already has a son and a daughter, was living in foster care when she won the National Lottery in 2003.

She had been placed with a kindly 
couple, Brian and Sheila Holmes, who provided her with the security and 
comfort she had lacked for so long.

But after her win she moved out and began a spending spree which led her to depression.

She spent £550,000 on four properties for herself and her family before splashing out £85,000 on cars.

Before
long she had paid £11,500 for breast implants. She later posed naked 
for a magazine, with only banknotes to preserve her modesty.

She spent £200 a month on hair extensions and much more on clothes.

Miss
Rogers treated her ex-boyfriends - including mechanic Simon Winthorpe, 
who got a £7,000 car and was paid £3,000 to be her chauffeur because she
was too young to drive.

Another ex-lover, Gary Fidler, received gifts worth £4,000.

But the good life didn't last for long. She developed a cocaine habit and ended up blowing £250,000 on parties and drugs.

It led to the breakdown of her relationship with Nicky Lawson, the father of her children, Debony and Kian, and she attempted suicide three times after she lost custody of them.

She said: 'I made bad choices with men as I was young and stupid, and I was partying to the point where I was totally out of control. Looking back I am horrified by the choices I made.'

Now 25, the former shop assistant, originally from Cockermouth and currently living in Workington, Cumbria, could not be happier.

She met the father of the twins, factory supervisor Paul Penny, two years ago and she says he has helped her to turn her life around.

She lives with Mr Penny, 33, in a modest rented three-bedroom terrace house. She had to sell the last home she owned for £70,000.

Miss Rogers has only £40,000 left from the sale, which she plans to use to support her babies and pay for their education.

The only 'luxury' item she has left is a second-hand BMW she bought with Mr Penny for £15,000.

She said: 'I might not have any of my millions left, but I have met the man of my dreams and together we are about to have twins and both of us could not be more excited.'
