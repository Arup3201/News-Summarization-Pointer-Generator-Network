Dr Khalid Qidwai and Shahnaz Qidwai

A woman was bludgeoned to death in her multi-million dollar waterfront home following a bitter feud between her husband and a tradesman.

Tony Halloun, who was hired to concrete Dr Khalid Qidwai’s driveway, went to his surgery and asked for $3,500 but Dr Qidwai refused to pay before the job was done.

This response allegedly prompted Halloun to use the chilling words ‘I'll win in the end’.

The following day Dr Qidwai’s wife, Shahnaz Qidwai, 65, was found bashed to death in their  home called Burnham Castle in Henley - a little known but wealthy suburb in northwest Sydney.

Halloun, who has pleaded not guilty to the murder, had arrived at the house at about 7.40 that morning then Dr Qidwai left to go to his Croydon surgery about 9am.

Halloun is alleged to have told police that three armed intruders stormed into the house telling him ‘don't worry, we are not here for you’ and then he said the men ordered him to ‘get her’.

So Halloun then grabbed Mrs Qidwai by the hair and dragged her, ‘kicking and screaming’.

The last time he saw her, Halloun said she had tears streaming down her face and a gun to her head.

‘She was in fear for her life,’  he said.

'I'll win in the end' are the chilling words of Tony Halloun (pictured) believed to have been said to Dr Khalid Qidwai the day before he allegedly murdered the doctor's wife in their Sydney home

The following day Dr Qidwai's wife, Shahnaz Qidwai, 65, was found bashed to death in their multi-million dollar waterfront home in Henley, northwest Sydney

Halloun, who was hired to concrete the Qidwai's driveway (pictured), went to Dr Qidwai's surgery and asked him for $3,500 but he refused to pay before the job was done which prompted Halloun's threatening words

Halloun said he then went to his car, smoked a cigarette and waited to see if the men came out, then about 40 minutes later he left the Qidwai’s property.

On the opening day of his trial on Tuesday, the Supreme Court heard the labourer contacted police a year after he was charged with the crime and said he had ‘more information’ about that fatal day on June 15, 2012.

It was one of three inconsistent versions of events that the financially-stressed Halloun gave after Mrs Qidwai was bashed to death inside her home, crown prosecutor Giles Tabuteau told the jury on Tuesday.

When the couple's youngest daughter Maha, 28, came home at 2pm, she found her mother on the floor near her bed with her face and mouth covered in blood and bruises - she was cold to touch.

Halloun had left more than two hours earlier.

Crown prosecutor Giles Tabuteau  (pictured) said Halloun took $3,400 from the home which Mrs Qidwai was organising the money to pay her husband's staff around the time of the attack

Mr Tabuteau said Halloun fabricated three different versions of events in order to explain DNA and crime scene evidence

At the time of Mrs Qidwai's death, the court heard she had been organising the money to pay her husband's staff and had about $3,400 in envelopes in the home.

'The crown case is that the money was taken at the time of or moments after the attack on Mrs Qidwai and that it was the accused who took that money,' Mr Tabuteau said.

The crown says Halloun's business was $97,000 in debt.

After police questioned him about the murder, Mr Tabuteau said he fabricated three different versions of events in order to explain DNA and crime scene evidence.

But Halloun's barrister Peter Lange questioned that Halloun's financial difficulties provided a motive.

'What does common sense tell you about a robbery worth $2000 to $4000? ... is that a motive to kill the wife of your employer?' he said.

The trial continues.
