The Arctic front sweeping across the United States has got so cold that Hell has literally frozen over.

As winter storm Hercules swept across the north of the country, the small town of Hell in Michigan saw temperatures plunge to -13C, with a wind chill of -33C.

The sub-zero polar air caused snow several feet deep to freeze over - cutting off the 200 residents of Hell. Shops in the town have been forced to close up while snowed in neighbors helped each other stay warm.

Bloomberg news Derek Wallbank revealed the town's plight, tweeting: 'Fun fact: it's currently -13 in Hell, MI, with a wind chill of -33. It has literally frozen over', while the story was also carried by Click on Detroit.

But the town of Hell is not thought to take its name from the fiery pit of eternal torment and there are two different theories for the origins of the town's name.

The first is that a pair of German travelers stepped out of a stagecoach one sunny afternoon in the 1830s, and one said to the other, 'So sch√∂n hell!' meaning 'So beautifully bright!'. Their comments were overheard by some locals and the name stuck.

Another possible theory is that soon after Michigan gained statehood, George Reeves was asked what he thought the town he helped settle should be called and replied, 'I don't care, you can name it Hell for all I care'.

In a rare turn of events, Hell, Norway, is warmer than its U.S. namesake. Temperatures were expected to reach as high as 5C on Wednesday, but will again drop below zero over the coming days. Its average January temperatures are between -4C and 3C.

Meanwhile Lake Michigan was actually found to be steaming because of the freezing air.

The storm has wreaked havoc across the U.S. after temperatures in the Midwest and East were colder than much of Antarctica on Tuesday.

The big chill started in the Midwest over the weekend, and by yesterday it covered about half of the country.

But all 50 states saw freezing temperatures at some point yesterday, including Hawaii, where it was -8C (18F) on top of Mauna Kea, a dormant volcano.

Across the south, temperatures dropped to record lows. Birmingham, Alabama, dipped to a low of -14C ( 7F), breaking the record of -11.7C (11F) set in 1970.

So far 21 people have already died from the freezing conditions, including seven in Illinois, and six in Indiana.

At least five people died after collapsing while shovelling snow, while several victims were identified as homeless people who either refused shelter or did not make it to a warm haven soon enough to save themselves from the bitter temperatures.

Around 1,200 flights were cancelled from Chicago's two airports yesterday while more than 500 passengers were stranded overnight on three Chicago-bound trains that were stopped by blowing and drifting snow in Illinois. Food ran low, but the heat stayed on.

Meanwhile many schools remained closed in Washington D.C. and Atlanta.

In New York City, Central Park was 5F on Tuesday - the coldest January 7 since 1896.

But the worst of the weather should be over in the next day or two. Warmer weather - at least, near or above freezing - is forecast for much of the stricken part of the country.
