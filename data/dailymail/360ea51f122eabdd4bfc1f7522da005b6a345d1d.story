On a mission: A Tornado crewman heads out to attack IS targets

British airstrikes against Islamic State militants are being conducted by morale-sapped pilots who are using broken equipment, claims an RAF serviceman.

The insider said RAF Akrotiri in Cyprus was being neglected, morale was poor and ground crews had been forced to eat humanitarian rations meant for Iraqis.

In a strongly-worded letter it was said that there is no hospital at the base – even though there are daily operations involving live ammunition.

In the letter to BBC’s Newsnight, the serviceman alleged that ‘the costs and quality of the catering and retail support are a disgrace’ and that crews there are led by a chain of command ‘so laced with budgetary fear … that no one knows what the plan is’.

It was also claimed that because services were undertaken by private contractors, Cypriot cleaners at the base were being charged to the UK taxpayers at three times the annual cost of an airman’s salary.

An RAF spokesman dismissed many of the claims, saying: ‘In our opinion this letter is factually inaccurate. In layman’s terms, it is completely full of holes.’

But a Ministry of Defence source confirmed that an incident in which ground crew had been given aid rations had taken place. During a recent visit to the base by an air vice-marshal, one sergeant from II Squadron complained about the quality of the food available to crews working overnight on Tornado jets.

The officer was said to have been so disgusted by the cheese sandwiches offered as meals to the night shift, he broke into a pallet of rations intended for dropping to refugees in northern Iraq and handed it out. The serviceman’s letter added: ‘It was better than what we were feeding our airmen.’

Newsnight reported that due to their age, the battle to keep some of the eight Tornados at the base airworthy has required long hours of work by ground crews, particularly on the engines.

On many days, just two or three of the jets are available for missions over Iraq. The Tornado, which has undergone numerous upgrades, has been in service with the RAF for more than 30 years. However, the MoD source insisted that the jet ‘continues to offer good serviceability and is meeting required tasking’.

Many RAF personnel are said to be exhausted after years of continuous deployments.

Although an MoD source said facilities at Akrotiri are comparable with RAF stations around the world, conditions are reported to be worse than those that personnel had experienced on operations in Afghanistan. Hot meals are only served during the day, with snacks provided at night.

Responding to suggestions that personnel are poorly fed, the MoD source said ‘crews were offered a small number of excess rations [a vegetarian curry] as a one-off gesture during a testing deployment’, and argued there was no question of the crews needing the humanitarian rations in order to be ‘adequately fed’.

Shortly after operations began against Islamic State in September, the number of Tornado fighter bombers was increased from six to eight. Newsnight reported this increase was necessary in order to ensure there were always two aircraft available for bombing missions.

RAF Tornados are flying daily missions over Iraq, identifying and destroying IS strongpoints and weaponry.
