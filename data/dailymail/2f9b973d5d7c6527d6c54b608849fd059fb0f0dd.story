A man
has run up a staggering £91,184 phone bill in just three months after calling a
daytime chat line to alleviate his loneliness.

Kevin
Waldrum, began calling the premium rate chat line after splitting from his
partner of 2 years.

The
former security guard, from Gladstone Avenue, Loughborough, says he will
continue to fight against paying the debt, which Vodafone have reduced to
£29,083, claiming it has ruined his life and forced him to begin taking a variety of
anti-anxiety medications.

The
45-year-old called the daytime chat line, which charges premium rates, after
seeing an advert on television, and claims he was unaware of the mounting cost
of his calls, which he made between September and November last year.

‘I
was flicking through the daytime TV channels and I saw the advert,' said Mr Waldrum. ‘I just wanted to see what is was all about.

‘You
ring up and there's all these options, they ask your name and sympathise with
you' he said.

Mr
Waldrum, who is currently unemployed, said that he felt able to speak to the
girls about his heartache and that he had a special bond with one girl,
‘Hannah’ who he spoke to on a regular basis.

‘I
was telling this girl Hannah about my previous relationship and how it had
ended 18 months before and she told me that she was having problems with her
boyfriend and it was all going wrong.

‘Her
and the other girls had a nickname for me, I was so well-known there.

‘When
I called up they used to say 'Loughborough Kev is on the phone'.’

Kevin says he had a special bond with the women premium rate chat line (posed by model)

Despite
an initial bill of £19,333.63 from his phone provider Vodafone, Mr Waldrum
continued to make regular calls to the chat line.

He
says he felt unable to stop: ‘I was back calling them pretty much right away

‘They
used to warn you when a call was coming to the end of the 20 minutes you were
allowed, and then I'd just phone straight back.

These
calls resulted in a second bill of £71,850.67, which prompted Mr Waldrum to
complain to Vodafone.

‘The
Vodafone need shutting down because they're ripping people off left, right and
centre,’ he said.

‘I'm
not putting all the blame on them but not even multi-millionaires would want to
spend this much on a phone bill, surely, so why I have been allowed to go up to £91,000.

‘I
admit I rang these numbers and it's partly my own fault but the line should
have gone dead before I started to incur such high charges.

‘They
must be taking millions from poor people like me.

‘It
has absolutely screwed my head up.

‘I am
so down, depressed, desperate and anxious over the whole situation.

‘All
I can think about from the moment I wake up to the moment I go to bed is, how
am I going to pay these bills?

Mr
Waldrum says the stress of  the bill
forced him to visit his doctor, who put him on medication to control his
stress.

He now takes Diazepam for his anxiety and
Nitrazepam to help him sleep.

But
he said he will not be able to move on with his life until the situation is
settled.

He
said: 'I called Vodafone and they said they were going to investigate but
I haven't heard anything since.

‘It's
been about six months of pure worry since then.

‘I've
been totally traumatised by it. I have realised now, I just think 'Why did I
ever do that?' I have deep regrets over it now.

‘Every
time I see a Vodafone shop I start to feel physically sick and get a migraine
and it makes me shake.

‘I
want people to be aware how it can destroy lives. They have ruined my life.’

Kevin intends to continue to fight paying the remainder of his phone bill, which he says has ruined his life

Vodafone
argue that they barred Mr Waldrum’s mobile phone for high charges but he
ordered a replacement SIM from a shop to allow him to carry on calling the
premium lines.

However
Vodafone admitted they had missed an opportunity to alert Mr Waldrum to the higher
costs at an earlier stage and following an investigation Vodafone has cut his
bill to £29,083.

A
spokesman for Vodafone said: 'By his own admission, Mr Waldrum made calls
to premium rate adult entertainment services more or less continuously over a
period of two months until we suspended the services on October 21 when the
total debt was £91,000.

‘We
had previously barred a phone used by Mr Waldrum on September 11 for high usage
but he got round this by requesting a replacement SIM card from a retail store,
saying he had lost the original.

‘He
was then able to continue to build up debt.

‘We
cannot manage our customers' spending for them, but we will try to alert them
to it if we are aware of an unusual high spending pattern.

‘Looking
back at the records, we can see that we could have alerted Mr Waldrum on
September 18.

‘It
can sometimes take several days for billing to register on our system, and by
this time, his extreme use of premium rate services meant his bill was already £29,083.

Since
we missed the opportunity to alert him at this stage, we will waive the charges
of around £61,000 incurred after this point as a gesture of goodwill. Mr
Waldrum remains liable for charges of £29,083.’

Kevin
has said he will continue to fight against being held liable for the remaining
amount - calling the offer 'rubbish'.

He
said: ‘They should drop the whole lot. They have to think about my health.

‘This
is not about money anymore, it is about respecting people.

‘They
haven't even called me to tell me that the charges were being reduced.’
