A New York City man was convicted Thursday of setting up the fatal shooting of his wife while the couple was on a walk with one of their young sons in New Jersey.

A jury deliberated for  four hours before convicting Kashif Parvaiz of scheming with his girlfriend to kill his wife and make it look like a random attack.

The August 2011 shooting occurred while Parvaiz and his wife, 27-year-old Nazish Noorani, walked with their son near her family's home in Boonton, a New Jersey suburb about 30 miles from New York that is home to a large Pakistani-American population.

Guiltyu: Kashif Parvaiz is escorted out of a Morris County court in New Jersey after a jury found him guilty on Thursday, Feb. 26, 2015 in Morristown, New Jersey of scheming with his girlfriend to kill his wife  27-year-old Nazish Noorani and make it look like a random attack

The way they were: Parvaiz and his wife Nazish (left) had two sons and Parvaiz had his wife killed while with one of them on a walk near their New Jersey home

Noorani was killed, Parvaiz was wounded and the boy was unharmed. The couple's other son was with family members in the house.

'Nothing will ever restore Nazish to her family. As her two young children grow up, they will never have their mother by their side. Her family, and most especially her siblings, will never see her again,' Morris County Prosecutor Fredric Knapp said in a statement. 'This verdict, however, demonstrates to all of her loved ones that justice has been served.'

Antoinette Stephen pleaded guilty to murder and other offenses and testified against Parvaiz. The Billerica, Massachusetts, resident was having an affair with Parvaiz and admitted firing the fatal shots.

Parvaiz first told police that his family had been attacked by a group of men who called them terrorists and suggested that it was a bias crime, prosecutors said. Noorani was originally from Karachi, Pakistan. 

Stephen and Parvaiz exchanged text messages in the days leading up to the shooting, according to an arrest affidavit released by the Morris County Prosecutor's Office.

'You hang in there. Freedom is just around ur corner,' read one text sent from a phone listed to Stephen's father to Parvaiz, according to the affidavit. 

Black magic: Prosecutors said during the three-week trial that Parvaiz emailed two black magic companies asking if they could come up with a way to make his wife leave him, kill herself or disappear. They said he paid at least $4,500 for spells and prayers from the company

Loving family: Mrs Noorani with her two sons, aged five and three. The youngest witnessed the horror

Scene: Police remove the stroller from the area. The couple's youngest witnessed the shooting death of his mother as orchestrated by his father

Subsequent texts from Stephen's number describe driving around the neighborhood to see how far away the nearest police station was, according to the affidavit. The exchange of texts continued up until 2 p.m. on the day of the shooting, authorities said. 

According to Morris County Prosecutor Robert Bianchi, Parvaiz's accounts of the attack were inconsistent and immediately raised suspicions.

Parvaiz told investigators the couple was attacked by a different combination of black and white males who shouted ethnic slurs, authorities said. In his initial story, the group shouted something about the family being 'terrorists,' authorities said.

Bianchi said investigators were deeply concerned when Parvaiz suggested it was a bias crime, but within hours 'it was obvious to investigators that this was sadly the alleged handy work of the victim's husband who allegedly did the unthinkable and plotted to murder his wife.'

Nazish Noorani lived in fear of her abusive husband as their marriage crumbled and chillingly foretold of her fate to her brother.

The victim's sister, Lubna Choudhry, cried in the hallway in the arms of her brother, Kaleem Norrani, after the verdict was read. The family did not immediately comment.

Prosecutors said during the three-week trial that Parvaiz emailed two black magic companies asking if they could come up with a way to make his wife leave him, kill herself or disappear. They said he paid at least $4,500 for spells and prayers from the company.

Parvaiz was convicted of murder, conspiracy to commit murder, endangering the welfare of a child, child abuse, hindering apprehension by lying to police and weapons charges. He faces life in prison at his sentencing, which is scheduled for April 24.
