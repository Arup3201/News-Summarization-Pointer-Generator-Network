CCTV footage capture Sammy Almahri on film on the night of Miss Aburas's suspected murder. It is believed he has not fled to Tanzania

An international manhunt is underway for a ‘dangerous and resourceful’ man after his online girlfriend was found dead in a hotel room on New Year's Eve.

The body of Nadine Aburas, 28, was discovered by staff at the Future Inn hotel in Cardiff hours after New-York based suspect Sammy Almahri, 44, fled from Heathrow Airport. 

The 44-year-old American flew out of the UK in the middle of the night – and is now the subject of a manhunt on four continents, suspected of her murder. 

Police in the UK, United States, Bahrain and East Africa are all involved in the hunt for Almahri. 

Today, police released a new picture showing Almahri, when he was captured on CCTV on the night of the murder.  

Yesterday, South Wales Police were checking Miss Aburas's computer for any clues over their online romance, including Facebook chats and emails between his home in New York City and her apartment in Cardiff Bay, South Wales. 

Miss Aburas had travelled to New York for a holiday with Almahri in the past, but it is believed to be the first time that he had met her in Britain.

It is thought he flew into the UK on Boxing Day and booked a £135-a-night room at the Future Inn hotel for December 30 and New Year's Eve.

He checked into the hotel with Miss Aburas, which is less than a mile away from her flat at 8.25pm on December 30.

The pair went out for an hour before returning at about 11pm.

But police say Almahri left at 3am on New Year’s Eve and hours later at around noon, the injured body of Miss Aburas was found by hotel staff.

Detectives then discovered Almahri had quickly booked a flight and flew from Heathrow to Bahrain at 10.30am on New Year’s Eve.

He then went to Doha in Qatar before moving on to Tanzania.

Detective Superintent Paul Hurley from South Wales Police said: 'It was clear to us that Nadine was murdered but we waiting for the results of a post mortem examination before we give more details.

'But we are aware that Almahri is resourceful and dangerous. He has the resources to support himself and people may be sheltering him.

'We are working with law enforcement agencies in all the countries involved to try to trace him.

'We are aware that their relationship went back some three years and that Nadine had been to New York to meet him.

An international manhunt has been launched for Almahr, who police have described as 'resourceful and dangerous'

Nadine Aburas was found dead in a guest room at the Future Inn hotel in Cardiff on New Year's Eve

'He had pre-booked the room at the hotel but only booked the flights out of the country on the day he left.

'We are appealing for information from hotel guests or visitors to the hotel may have seen them together.

'We have been working closely with our counterparts in both NYPD and police officers in Tanzania.

'From our inquiries we have discovered that Almahri is very resourceful and has access to funds, which may further assist his evasion from law enforcement agencies.

'It is difficult to establish what he does for a living but he has access to financial resources. I consider this man to be a dangerous individual. He is not to be approached.'

South Wales Police say they do not know why he went to Tanzania, adding it may be a case of him getting on the first available flight to escape capture.

Miss Aburas's mother Andrea, 58, and her family are being supported by police as they worked with the National Crime Agency to co-ordinate the international hunt.

Her mother, who also lives less than a mile from the hotel, said: 'Nadine was a lovely, bubbly girl and unique and talented woman. She always wanted to help people and everybody loved her.

'She has left such a massive hole in our family and we will miss her so much. The family respectfully request that they be left to grieve privately.'

Almahri is believed to have 'distinctive injuries to his face' which are not linked to the killing but police did not speculate how they were caused.

Police are checking his credit and debit card spending in a bid to trace his movements across the continents and are working with the National Crime Agency.

An inquest is due to be opened by Cardiff coroner Christopher Woolley later this week where the results of the post mortem examination are due to be released.

Anyone with information is urged to contact police on 101 or call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
