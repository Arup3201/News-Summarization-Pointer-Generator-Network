Sexy lingerie may be at the top of many women's Christmas lists this year but you'll need an especially rich and generous partner to receive an item from a new capsule collection in Selfridges.

The department store will exclusively stock lingerie by label Bordelle whose collection includes one girdle dress costing an eye-watering £4,000.

The bondage-inspired black garment is made with satin elastic bands, customised French embroidered lace, 18-carat gold plated decorations and buckles and hand-sewn Swarovski crystals.

British designer, Alex Popa, who founded Bordelle, told Vogue the lingerie is worth the high price tag because it's made-to-measure using expensive materials.

She said: 'The brand has been going for five years now, and we really wanted to create something really decadent this Christmas.

'Each piece is handmade and numbered one, two or three of three. The pieces use gold filigree, Swarovski crystals, the most luxurious fabrics - and each piece takes seven to ten days to make. Completely made to order, it's our most couture collection yet.'

Expensive taste: This Adana Body, left is £1,302 while the Angela dress, right, is £651

Although still not affordable for many, other items in the collection come at a cheaper price than the extravagant girdle dress.

A similar version of the £4,000 item without crystals is £1,025.

Prices for other garments range from £54 for an 'everyday' thong while a simpler corset dress costs £420 and a bra and knicker set £126 and £72 respectively. All items are available in small, medium and large sizes with adjustable features for a closer fit.

Miss Popa told MailOnline: 'There is something that can appeal to every woman, from the modern 
romantic to the fashion forward dominatrix looking for design novelty, 
impeccable quality and a little bit of fun and games.'

This set costs £348.75 for the bodice bra and £186 for the suspender briefs: No wonder the label has a celebrity following

Bordelle launched in 2009 and have quickly become a favourite with celebrities and those with expensive taste.

They've made designs for Lady Gaga, Shakira and Christina Aguilera in their London workshop.

Their £900 feather girdle sold out in 24 hours at Selfridge's Oxford Street store in central London ahead of Christmas 2009.

Miss Popa said she was inspired to set up her own label at a time when 'very few lingerie labels were truly experimental with their offerings and there was a genuine lack of designer lingerie that successfully combined directional lingerie design with high fashion and a touch of bondage.'

She added: ''Women are powerful and extravagant and this is something I explored with the initial designs.'
