A toddler has been left traumatised after watching his tiny chihuahua puppy get 'torn apart' by a Staffordshire bull terrier.

Lawson Morgan-Cockburn, two, was out walking with his mother Sarah Morgan, 26, and their three chihuahuas when their youngest dog, a one-year-old named Bruno, was set upon.

Bull terrier Lennox, who was adopted by his owners as a rescue dog a year ago, escaped from a garden before mauling puppy Bruno while Lawson was still holding his lead.

Sarah Morgan, 26, says her two-year-old son Lawson has been left traumatised after watching his one-year-old chihuahua puppy Bruno mauled to death in front of him

Miss Morgan said: 'It was the most horrible thing I've ever seen. The Staffy burst through a gate and started attacking one of my other dogs, named Maddie.

'Little Bruno started yapping at the Staffy trying to stop it - and the terrier turned on him instead.

'Bruno's head was in the terrier's jaws and it just clamped down. He had Bruno's entire head and front legs in his mouth and he was shaking him around like a rag doll.

'Lawson started to scream. I picked him up and ran away as fast as I could. I knew there was nothing I could do for Bruno. My focus was to get Lawson to safety.'

Bruno was mauled to death by rescue-dog Lennox, a Staffordshire bull terrier, while Lawson was still holding his lead

Miss Morgan, from Aspatria in Cumbria, said the terrier attacked after becoming agitated as the group walked past a neighbour's garden.

She said: 'I could see that the terrier was getting annoyed at us being there - it was barking and running back and forward in the garden.

'I apologised to the owner's girlfriend, who was in the garden, and she told me not to worry, because the dog was secured in the garden and couldn't get out through the gate.

'The next thing I knew, the terrier had managed to escape and had opened the gate itself and got through.'

'Lots of neighbours rushed out and tried to pull the terrier off, but nobody could stop it.

'Lawson was screaming his head off. The whole village must have heard - it was a frenzy of gnashing teeth and screaming.

'The dog turned and I could tell it wanted blood. It had a look in its eyes - it was throwing Bruno round like a chew toy. That dog is evil. It could have gone for my son.'

Miss Morgan said the attack only stopped when the terrier's owner managed to drag the dog back inside.

She said: 'The Staffy unlocked its jaws when it realised Bruno was dead and  its fun was over.

'When we examined Bruno afterwards I 
saw that all the fur was missing where he was bitten. You could see all 
the puncture wounds and was covered in blood and slather. He looked torn
 apart.'

Miss Morgan, a waitress, said Lawson has suffered with night terrors since the incident.

Last month, the Dangerous Dogs
 Act was amended to make it a criminal offence for a person in charge of
 a dog to allow it to be dangerously out of control in a public place.

Cumbria police have said no charges have been brought.

The attack happened as Ms Morgan was walking her three chihuahuas with Lawson. The bull terrier escaped from his owners' garden after becoming agitated before grabbing hold of Bruno

Ms Morgan said that she ran away as the terrier grabbed hold of Bruno, trying to get Lawson to safety. She said the attack only stopped after the bull terrier's owner managed to pull him away

Lenny Graham, 27, the owner of the six-year-old Staffordshire bull terrier named Lennox, said he was taking a bath in his house when Lennox escaped through the gate.

He said: 'Most of the neighbours had come out and were standing around. I saw the other dog lying on the ground.

'I tried to go up to the lass to apologise but under the circumstances, she didn't want to say anything. It's understandable.

'I feel so sorry for that lad. I'm riddled with guilt over it. It was an accident.

'We only let Lennox in the garden when we're out there too. We let him have a bit of fresh air between walks, otherwise we keep him in the house.

'Lennox had an awful life before he came to me. He was locked in a room for the first five years of his life.

'He's been excellent with us. He's very good with children and other dogs. I've tried to reach out to the family to offer my condolences but they don't want to talk to me.'
