Facebook's self-destructing message service is now available internationally, just a week after officially launching in the U.S.

Called Slingshot, it is designed to appeal to fans of Snapchat and other messaging apps that let people send self-destructing messages to friends.

However, the app adds a novel twist, as users cannot see a friend's picture until they send one back.

Facebook's Slingshot app has begun rolling out internationally from today. It allows people to send messages to friends (pictured left), but they can only view them if they send a message back. The app also allows people to react to an image (right)

After downloading the app, you can sign up either with a Facebook account or your mobile phone number.

You add contacts based on your Facebook friends and phone contacts.

Opening the app takes you to its camera, which has a 'shoot' button for taking a snapshot and a 'selfie' button.

After taking a photo, you can type a message of up to 140 characters on it, draw a picture or send a 15-second video.

You can then send it to some, or all, of your Slingshot contacts.

On Slingshot, you can see a message only if you send one back.

Until you do, you'll only see a pixelated preview of what's in store.

'With Slingshot, we wanted to build something where everybody is a creator and nobody is just a spectator,' Facebook said.

'When everyone participates, there’s less pressure, more creativity and even the little things in life can turn into awesome shared experiences. This is what Slingshot is all about.'

Slingshot draws inevitable comparisons to Snapchat.

Facebook even tried to buy Snapchat's maker for $3 billion, if reports are to be believed. But the two messaging services are different.

Unlike Snapchat, there is no time limit on when a Slingshot message disappears.

Once a person looks at a message, they can flick it off to the side of their screen so that it self destructs.

Slingshot also allows reaction shots.

It splits a user's screen in half and lets them snap a photo to return to the 
sender. The recipient doesn't have to send back a message to
 view the response.

Slingshot works with both Apple and Android devices - on iOS 7 and Android Jelly Bean and KitKat.

A Facebook account isn't required to use the new app.

'Photos and videos that don’t stick around forever allow for sharing that’s more expressive, raw and spontaneous,' said Facebook.

'We can connect the same way we like to live: in the moment. We’ve enjoyed using Snapchat to send each other ephemeral messages and expect there to be a variety of apps that explore this new way of sharing.

'With Slingshot, we saw an opportunity to create something new and different: a space where you can share everyday moments with lots of people at once.'

Ten people have been working on Slingshot since January. It grew out of a December hackathon at Facebook where people were trying to figure out out 'new ways of sharing'.

Slingshot
 is the second app to come out of Facebook's Creative Labs, an internal 
project designed to develop separate apps in a start-up-like environment.

The first app from the lab was Paper, a social news reader that came out in February.

The
 effort comes as Facebook seeks to broaden its reach beyond its 1.28 
billion users by splintering off some of its functions to separate apps -
 and creating stand-alone apps for entirely new features and audiences.
