A British fugitive accused of helping two violent robbers escape by attacking a prison van as they travelled to court, has been arrested in Benidorm.

Paul Taylor was detained by armed police as he ate at a terrace cafe with friends.

An international arrest warrant was issued for Taylor after the spectacular April 30 2013 rush-hour raid on a prison van carrying Ryan MacDonald, 21, and Stevie McMullen, 32, to Manchester Crown Court from Britain's first privately financed prison HMP Altcourse in Merseyside.

An international arrest warrant was issued for Paul Taylor after the spectacular April 30 2013 rush-hour raid on a prison van carrying Ryan MacDonald, 21, and Stevie McMullen, 32, to Manchester Crown Court from Britain's first privately financed prison HMP Altcourse in Merseyside

McMullen was due to appear on conspiracy to rob charges and MacDonald was due to be formally sentenced for unconnected offences of conspiracy to commit robbery.

Three men wearing balaclavas smashed a car into the side of the van on a busy road and threatened one of the guards with a sawn-off shotgun after bringing the vehicle to a halt and breaking its windows with axes and sledgehammers.

The prison break fugitives, dubbed the 'most wanted men in Britain' while they on the run, were captured within days after a £10,000 reward was offered for information on their whereabouts.

Ryan MacDonald, 20, left, and and Stevie 
McMullen, 32, right, were both convicted of conspiracy to possess an 
imitation firearm at Minshull Street Crown Court, Manchester. Both 
pleaded guilty to conspiracy to escape at earlier hearings

McMullen was held following a police swoop on a car on the A6 near Lancaster and McDonald was nabbed at a house in Ordsall, Greater Manchester.

A gang of men and women were later convicted over the daring escape.

Taylor, 25, is now being held at a prison near Madrid after an extradition hearing in the Spanish capital.

He is expected to be flown back to Britain in the next few days.

The two unnamed Brits with him have been bailed after being arrested on suspicion of using a stolen car and motorbike. They now face trial in Spain.

The arrests were carried out by Spain's National Police Fugitives Unit, led by Olga Lizana, which last year tracked down and detained 40 British criminals and suspects.

Detective Inspector Lizana, who keeps a 28in machete in her office which she confiscated from fugitive armed robber Andrew Moran after arresting him at his Costa Blanca home last May, has warned British criminals hiding out in Spain she is on their tail.

She said recently: 'We will be spoiling their holidays in Spain very soon.'

A spokesman for Spain's National Police, identifying the arrested Brit trio only by their initials, said today: 'Spanish National Police officers have arrested in Benidorm a fugitive wanted by the UK for crimes including assisting the escape of prisoners and unlawful possession of a weapon.

'He was located in a cafe in Benidorm together with two other individuals who have also been arrested for driving a motorbike and car stolen in the United Kingdom.

'The arrested fugitive, aided by two armed men, helped two prisoners to escape from a van which was taking them from HMP Altcourse to Manchester Crown Court.'

Nearly £4,000 in cash and four mobiles phones were seized from the British trio.
