These two screen grabs show you just how hard man-marking is — and how bad Manchester United were at it for Didier Drogba’s goal.

In the first image, all the Chelsea players are picked up. A split second later and Drogba, John Terry, Branislav Ivanovic and Oscar are all unmarked.

Unless you are physically holding somebody — as United did earlier in the game — it is impossible to man-mark someone from a setpiece.

The attacker has the advantage and if you switch off for a moment, you are in trouble. That’s why I favour zonal marking.

But as the ball comes in, Chelsea's aerial threats are all in open space and Drogba scores

And having 5ft 8in Rafael marking 6ft 2in Drogba is criminal. Louis van Gaal says Marouane Fellaini is to blame as he was supposed to be marking him but the players should be in no doubt.

Ironically, it was the man who was supposed to be marking the space who is most to blame for the goal.

Robin van Persie’s position is far too deep, he should be nearer the six-yard line, ready to attack the ball. Instead, when it comes in, he melts away towards the goal-line rather than attacking the ball.

At Arsenal we used to put Patrick Vieira in that area as it would take an incredible ball to get past him.

United might have to rethink positioning Van Persie there.
