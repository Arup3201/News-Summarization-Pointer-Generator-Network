A renowned Russian ballerina with the illustrious Bolshoi Ballet has decided to leave the theatre and live in Canada after receiving  threats.

The abrupt announcement by leading soloist Svetlana Lunkina comes only weeks after sulphuric acid was thrown in the face of the theatre's artistic director, Sergei Filin.

The historic theatre, first opened in 
1776, is known for its bitter, ego-driven disputes, with some describing
the situation as 'gangsterism'.

Departed: Svetlana Lunkina is leaving the Bolshoi Ballet after receiving threats

It is considered an
enduring symbol of Russian culture and a big draw for both locals and 
foreign tourists, but has seen power struggles among both dancers and 
directors during its more than 200-year history.

Past incidents include dead cats have been thrown on stag and broken glass inserted into ballet pumps by jealous rivals, reported The Times.

The threats against Lunkina, 33, seem not to be linked to those against Filin.

Svetlana Lunkina as Aspcia, the Pharaoh's Daughter and Ruslan Skvortsov as Lord Wilson / Taor (L) perform in the Bolshoi Ballet's production of 'The Pharaoh's Daughter' at the Royal Opera House.  and she dances in the dress rehearsal of "Swan Lake" at the Royal Opera House in London.

According to daily Russian newspaper Izvestia, they are linked to a film her husband, producer Vladislav Moskalev, had been working on.

It was due to feature the great Russian imperial ballerina 
Matilda Kshesinskaya, but Moskalyev was dropped from the 
project after he fell out with his business partner, who is now suing 
him for $3.7 million (£2.3 million.)

'I think we need to react to these threats.' Lunkina told the newspaper 
Izvestia on Tuesday.

Concerning: The threats are linked to a film her husband, producer Vladislav Moskalev, had been working on until he got into a dispute with his business partner

Reopen: The Bolshoi, which has ballet and opera troupes, reopened last February after a six-year renovation to its colonnaded landmark building near the Kremlin

'These people have no right to interfere in our 
private lives or my professional work.'

Lunkina, who has a seven-year-old son, has been living in Canada for the last six months and will shortly begin dance classes at a dance studio in Kleinburg, the Toronto Star reports.

Her prolonged disappearance from the Bolshoi stage had already puzzled fans who initially suspected she had suffered an injury before rumours spread that she was no longer in Russia, reported AFP.

The ballerina had been due to appear later this year in 
Stravinsky’s The Rite of Spring but has been given leave of absence by 
the Bolshoi..

Gangsterism: Sergei Filin, 42, artistic director of the Bolshoi Ballet, was the victim of an acid attack. He was interviewed from the Moscow hospital where he is being treated, left, after the incident

Meanwhile Filin remains in hospital 
since the attack outside his apartment and he may soon be transferred 
from Moscow to Aachen, Germany for more treatment

His right eye is seriously damaged but doctors are hopeful his left one can be saved.

The dancer is thought to have suffered weeks of personal harassment ahead of the incident.

The man seen as Filin's main rival Nikolai Tsiskaridze, was one of the first people to be interviewed after the attack.

The Bolshoi, which has both ballet and opera troupes, reopened last February after a six-year renovation to its landmark colonnaded building, close to Red Square in the very centre of Moscow.

As a symbol of Russian culture for more than 200 years, it is a big draw for both locals and foreign tourists, and has seen power struggles among both dancers and directors throughout its history.

Since the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, many of those conflicts, whether driven by egos or artistic convictions, have been played out in public.

After the tightly controlled three-decade tenure of Yuri Grigorovich ended in 1995, the Bolshoi Ballet went through five artistic directors before Filin's appointment.

In 2003 Anatoly Iksanov, director of the Bolshoi, dismissed ballerina Anastasia Volochkova after reportedly saying she was too heavy for male dancers to lift, and in 2011 a senior ballet manager resigned after a scandal over sexually explicit photographs.

Filin, a Moscow native, joined the Bolshoi's ballet troupe in 1988 and was named its artistic director in March 2011.

Tsiskaridze, a traditionalist, was 
one of several whom Iksanov passed over in favour of Filin for the post 
of artistic director in March 2011.

He has been very vocal in the past about criticising the theatre, although he has expressed his outrage at the attack on Filin.

General director of the Bolshoi Theatre says Tsiskaridze 'is like an abscess.'

'All
his worldwide speaking bad about his own home which made him a star, 
and he is doing it and he never stops and he will not be stopped,' he 
told The Daily Telegraph.

'Without
any punishment or any reaction, he is free to do what he wants – it 
brings an unhealthy atmosphere inside the company. I am not ashamed to 
say it openly, because evil has now appeared here.'

In an interview immediately after the attack Filin said the attacker wore a hood and either a mask or a scarf, so only his eyes were visible.

'I got scared and I thought he was going to shoot me,' Filin, his face covered with white bandages, told REN TV.

'I turned around to run, but he raced ahead of me.'

Filin, a Moscow native, joined the 
Bolshoi's ballet troupe in 1988 and was named its artistic leader in 
March 2011, after three years in a similar position at another Moscow 
theatre.

There was 'fierce rivalry' for the Bolshoi position at the time, according to RIA Novosti.

Such is the power and prestige of the post in Russian life that Anatoly Iksanov, director of the Bolshoi, said he believed the attack was a product of envy or rivalry.

Filin had already reported having his car tyres slashed and his emails hacked, as well as receiving repeated nuisance calls from someone who stayed silent when he answered.

'He said, `I have a feeling that I am on the front lines,'' Iksanov quoted Filin as telling him Thursday before the attack.

The Bolshoi's spokeswoman Katerina 
Novikova confirmed to Izvestia that Lunkina had requested leave for the 
season and that the company had approved it.
