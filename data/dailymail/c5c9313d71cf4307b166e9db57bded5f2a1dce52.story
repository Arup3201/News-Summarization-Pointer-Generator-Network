Egypt is poised to lurch towards Islamic rule as the first free elections in 30 years get under way today.

Islamic parties are set for a democratic coup as Egyptians go to the polls nine months after ousting dictator Hosni Mubarak.

The main losers are likely to be the ‘Facebook revolutionaries’, who were hailed as the democratic future of the Middle East when the Arab Spring uprisings began in January.

Peace: Young children joined in with the protests in Tahrir Square at the weekend

There was further violence in the capital Cairo over the weekend.

At least 40 people have been killed in fierce clashes in the past week as protesters demand the resignation of the military. Yesterday Egypt’s military ruler warned of ‘extremely grave’ consequences if the turbulent nation did not pull through its current crisis.

Field Marshal Hussein Tantawi said: ‘We will not allow troublemakers to meddle in the elections. Egypt is at a crossroads – either we succeed politically, economically and socially or the consequences will be extremely grave and we will not allow that.

None of this would have happened if there were no foreign hands. We will not allow a small minority of people who don’t understand to harm Egypt’s stability.’ 

Protesters, who were still in Tahrir Square last night, say they are coming under fire from a police sniper.

They have put up wanted posters demanding the capture of ‘The Eye Hunter’ – a police marksman accused of shooting people in the eyes with rubber bullets.

Ousted: The Arab Spring uprising against Hosni Mubarak began in January

At least five demonstrators have allegedly been blinded in an eye by the sharpshooter named as First Lieutenant Mahmoud Sobhi El Shinawi.

He has become a hate figure among the protesters, who have posted a video on the internet said to show El Shinawi taking aim with his rifle and being congratulated by a colleague on scoring another ‘bull’s eye’ hit.

El Shinawi has been ordered by Egypt’s
general prosecutor to submit to questioning over the suspected 
shootings.

Today’s election is the first of three rounds of voting 
spread over two months.

But voters face the choice of a bewildering array of 6,000 candidates and dozens of parties and coalitions.

It
is expected to be dominated by the once-banned Muslim Brotherhood. 
Analysts think they could win roughly a third of votes, likely to be far
greater than the hundreds of small parties who will each get only a 
fraction of the vote.

The Brotherhood’s popularity stems mainly from working-class Egyptians.

Outgunned
and outnumbered, liberal candidates are not expected to fare as well.

The Social Democratic Party – a grouping of prominent intellectuals who 
believe in a market-based economy – has already announced it is 
withdrawing from the parliamentary race because of the pre-election 
violence.

After voting today and tomorrow, two further ballots are planned for the rest of the country on December 14 and January 3. The final election results will be announced on January 13.

News of the Muslim Brotherhood’s likely victory comes as an Islamic party is set to form a government in Morocco for the first time in the North African country’s history. Nationwide election results yesterday indicated an overall majority for the Islamic Justice and Development Party (PJD).

Although the PJD is considered a moderate party, its success will concern those who believe that religious parties will weaken western influence in the region.

Al-Qaeda has struck several times in the country in recent years, including a bomb attack in the tourist city of Marrakesh in April which killed 17, including a Briton.  

Last month saw Tunisia – the country where the Arab Spring started – electing Ennahda, another moderate Islamic party.

Truce: Fighting may have stopped in Tahrir Square, but it has not stopped protesters from taunting police

Protest: At least 35,000 protesters had crowded into Tahrir Square as riot police and military fired tear gas around government buildings last week

Abdelilah Benkirane, the PJD leader who is now set to become prime minister of Morocco, said his party was not made up of Islamic fundamentalists looking to introduce sharia law.

‘We are not trying to set up a religious regime, or a Caliphate, as some suggest,’ he said.

‘This is absurd. We are in the year 2011.

‘We want true democracy and a better life for Moroccans.’

While near-neighbours including Tunisia, Egypt and Libya saw their despotic rulers deposed or  murdered following the Arab Spring rebellions, Morocco has avoided  any serious disturbances beyond street protests.
