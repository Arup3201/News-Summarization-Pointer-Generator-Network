Thousands of time lapse photographs have helped create this breathtaking gallery charting the changing seasons of the British Isles.

The Great British Year covers the four seasons across a quartet of television programmes featuring the greatest natural moments of the year.

The first episode of the series, on the winter, was broadcast by the BBC this week.

The Great British Year will depict the four seasons with images taken across the British Isles over a year. Here is a snow-covered tree in Ashton Court, Bristol

The team placed thosuands of cameras all over the UK in order to capture the exact moments the landscapes changed.

The first programme, which focused on winter, captured, among other things, the migration of grey seals on a frosty Cornwall beach in February heading for the biting cold sea.

The footage showed the huge animals feeling uncharacteristically cold because they had only just shed their old fur.

The first episode, which was broadcast on Wednesday, also captured the iconic winter robin making use of molehills to get into the frozen ground.

The episode rounded off with a pair of distinctive great crested grebes on an Oxford lake in March, celebrating the end of the chilly season with a courtship dance on the water.

BBC Natural History Unit producer James Brickell said: 'Throughout the series we have used a range of technological approaches to filming which will visualise seasonal change in spectacular ways, from the frost as it shrouds the country, and the winter mist, to the moment the leaves emerge and woodlands and carpets of bluebells are visited by bumblebees.

'We have used time-lapse photography sequences to show a new and intriguing visual perspective on how the people of Britain are entwined with the natural fabric and seasonal rhythms.'
