It would have been career suicide for most people.

But former Blue Peter presenter Richard Bacon has claimed ‘positive things came out of’ being fired for taking cocaine.

The 1998 scandal reduced Bacon’s father to tears, while causing embarrassment for the BBC.

But giving an interview 16 years after becoming the first host to be sacked from the children’s programme, the broadcaster, 38, boasted that ‘the Blue Peter thing’ served as an ‘ice-breaker’, which opened doors in other directions.

Bacon said: ‘The Blue Peter thing changed the whole course of my life; the path I was going down altered dramatically.

‘Without it, I probably would’ve gone to some kind of holiday show, promoting two-night stays somewhere. It had a huge impact. It’s a fact of my life, and almost as big a part of me now as one of my limbs.

‘I’m not in any way advocating that people should try that as a career plan but, like the Japanese proverb says, out of adversity, came opportunity. Positive things came out of it.’

Bacon was just 18 months into his dream job at Blue Peter when he was fired at the age of 22 after admitting he took cocaine in a London nightclub.

At the time the BBC issued a statement from Lorraine Heggessey, head of children’s programmes, which said: ‘It is sad that such a talented presenter as Richard Bacon has not only let himself and his colleagues down but, most important of all, he has let down the millions of children who watch Blue Peter.’

A producer told Bacon him he would never work in television again.

More than a decade on, Bacon’s career has seen him present multiple television programmes for the Corporation, as well as for Channel 4 and ITV.

Until it stopped broadcasting in September, he also had a regular radio show on BBC Radio 5 Live.

Referring to the scandal as an ‘ice-breaker’, Bacon, who is a black card holder at private members’ club Soho House, said in an interview with the Daily Mirror: ‘It opened a whole new series of jobs, like the gig at Channel 4’s Big Breakfast. I became known as the naughty boy, working with all the other naughty kids. I never thought for a second I’d stop working because of it.

‘I’m an extremely positive person and never thought I’d not work for the BBC again. It’s such a broad organisation that for them to speak with one voice and ban me completely seemed unlikely.’

Financially, Bacon, who was educated at £24,000 a year Worksop College, has also done well - he is in the top 1 per cent of British earners - raising questions over whether he was the ideal presenter for his latest project, Channel 4’s How Rich Are You?, which aired last night.

Bacon said: ‘The show isn’t a communist manifesto but we need more equality. the gap between rich and poor has become too big. The ladder isn’t taller, the rungs have got further apart.’

The one-off documentary examined the poverty gap in Britain, with Bacon criticising a system where ‘the rich get richer and the poor get poorer’.

He recently bought property in West Hollywood, where he is moving with his wife Rebecca and children, after reportedly landing a prime-time TV series in the States.

Last week it emerged the privately-educated star, who has been described as belonging to the ‘smug metropolitan elite’ is renting his £3 million London property for £15,000 a month during the temporary move.
