More than 100 dogs are trapped in 'disgusting, inhumane' squalor at a puppy breeding farm in north-western NSW, despite notifications to the RSPCA and local authorities, says an animal rights group.

Debra Tranter, founder of Victoria-based organisation Oscar’s Law, says she was ‘horrified’ to find a heavily pregnant labrador, lying dead on the cold concrete floor of a shed at the rural property near Armidale recently.

‘Usually when I go into these places, I shut down emotionally because I just have to get the photos,’ Tranter told Daily Mail Australia. ‘This time I was caught out: I just sat there with her and patted her for half an hour, it was so sad. The worst part is that her death was preventable.’

Ms Tranter, who has been rescuing  dogs from 'puppy factories' for more than 20 years, travelled to the property this week to photograph the abuse after she was tipped off  by members of the community. She  has made several trips to the farm since January and says she reported what she saw to the RSPCA numerous times.

‘We've been complaining about this farm for more than a year now and the authorities have ignored us,’ she told Daily Mail Australia. ‘This time I had to go public.’

RSPCA chief inspector David O'Shannessy has told Fairfax Media that  the owner complies with minimum standards for breeding facilities.

'There are no immediate concerns for their welfare,' he said.

But the owner of the puppy farm, Jennifer Frazer, has been known to authorities for over a year. In December, the RSPCA raided the property and charged Frazer with aggravated animal cruelty and failure to provide veterinary care. She was made to relinquish 27 dogs, fined $11,500 and was placed on a 12-month good behaviour bond, Fairfax reported.

Debra Tranter says the 'puppy factory' should have been shut down. 

'This case proves that the system we have cannot properly safeguard animals,' she said. 'A fine to a puppy farmer is nothing more than the lost sale of one or two puppies to a pet shop.'

Tranter says there are currently about  130 dogs at the property who are living and giving birth in 'filthy, filthy conditions' and at least 10 dogs that require immediate veterinary care.

‘There is one dog I'm especially concerned about: A Labrador that is never let out of her enclosure, she is only being fed every other day, at most, and she is so lame she struggles to walk. She has a number of mammary tumours but it's her lameness and pain that is so distressing.' 

'She is so lame she struggles to walk,' says Debra Tranter, who travelled to rural NSW to photograph animal abuse at the Frazer property near Armidale.

A vet report that was leaked to Ms Tranter and used in the RSPCA's case against Ms Frazer last year,  described the poor condition of several dogs that had to be put down following the property raid. It noted one female terrier who was being attacked by a pack of other dogs.

'She had an abdominal wound from which her intestines had eviscerated. She had multiple puncture wounds over her body and bruising around her eyes. Her jaw was clamped shut and she had a trickle of fresh blood from her nose,' the vet had written. 

These puppies were locked with their mother in a 'freezing cold' shed in the middle of winter

Debra Tranter wants the leadership of RSPCA NSW  to change, saying that in all her years investigating puppy farms across Australia, she has only ever had poor responses from the NSW branch. She has called for the resignation of NSW CEO Steve Coleman. 

‘The RSPCA has the highest authority to act to stop animal cruelty. We have to take these cases to the RSPCA which is why it’s so important for people in the position to show strong, compassionate leadership.

‘I honestly believe that the reason these dogs have been left behind is because it’s seen in NSW as just too hard and too expensive to relocate and rehabilitate them.'

Tranter says the response from some arms of government has also been disheartening. She says NSW Shadow Minister for Primary Industries, Steve Whan, has emailed her organisation to complain about being 'bombarded' with hundreds of rude emails petitioning for action on the factory farming of pets. The department is responsible for administering the 1973 Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act.

When the Daily Mail spoke with Ms Tranter, she was on the road taking a car full of rescue dogs that had been seized by council officers from an illegal farm  in Victoria. She was taking them to a veterinary nurse, and then on to foster care for rehabilitation and behavioural therapy. 

She says she has a 'pretty good' success rate with her rescue dogs. 

'We work incredibly hard, however long it takes, to get them to learn to be in a house and around people - our vet bill is horrendous!'

'These little ones are quite traumatised and they have a long journey ahead of them - but they will be ok.'

Tranter says there are hundreds of 'puppy factories' in Australia, some registered but many operating illegally. The only way to stop this, she says, is to put an end to the sale of cute puppies in pet shop windows. 

'Puppy farms are very much a hidden industry, so the chances of breeders being caught or having a complaint lodged against them is less than small,' she said.

'We are lobbying for a full ban on puppies in pet shops. Pet shops are simply retail outlets for puppy factories that perpetuate abuse.'

The puppies in the bread basket were huddled together to keep warm in near freezing temperatures in August, with nothing but a filthy, bloodied rag, says Tranter.
