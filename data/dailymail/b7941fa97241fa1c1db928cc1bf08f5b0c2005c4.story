A Wisconsin woman whose high speed drunk driving left her two friends dead and injured another in 2012 was sentenced Tuesday to seven years in prison.

Ashley Baumann, 26, spoke publicly at the seven hour sentencing hearing for the first time since her crazed driving killed Jessica Hartwig, 33, and Misty Glisch, 31, and seriously injured Jerrica Woller.

'I am not the monster the media has made me out to be,' she told Lincoln County Circuit Judge Jay Tlusty. 'I wish I had the answers to the questions about what happened that night, but I don't, and I'm sorry for that.'

The sentence was around half the jail time prosecutors had asked for.

That prosecutor, Tara Jenswold, wanted Baumann to get 14 years plus 10 years probation thereafter.

Jenswold pointed to what she called Baumann's lack of remorse and refusal to accept responsibility for the crash which experts revealed happened at well over 90MPH, reports the Wausau Daily Herald.

Played at the trial were damning recordings made of conversations Baumann had while in the Lincoln County Jail. Baumann actually ridicules Woller, who very nearly died in the crash.

'I hate her,' Baumann is heard to say.

it was reported that just before the crash Woller warned Baumann to stop her reckless driving mere moments before the crash.

Horrific: Baumann was driving in excess of 90MPH when she lost control and her car spun out in this field in June 2012

Baumann's defense attorney Wright Laufenberg argued his client 'has always felt horrible about what happened.' 

Despite that, the judge chose not to hand Baumann the sentence prosecutors wanted. 

'Clearly this is a tragedy,' Tlusty said. 'It has affected so many people both young and old...There are no winners. The legal system cannot undo what has occurred.'

The judge also referenced Baumann's drinking. 

'Significant to the court is that alcohol was involved,' he said as he noted her history of alcohol abuse.

Baumann's blood alcohol level after the crash was measured at twice the legal limit.

A jury convicted Baumann in May on all seven counts against her, including two counts of homicide while operating a vehicle under the influence and one count of injury by intoxicated use of a vehicle.
