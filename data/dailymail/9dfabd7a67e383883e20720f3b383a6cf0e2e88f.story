Not struck off: Lorraine Bloice referred to her students as 'beasts'

A teacher who called her pupils 'beasts' and referred to a child with special needs as 'a f****** little s***' will still be able to work as a teacher, an education panel has ruled.

Lorraine Bloice, 32, was found guilty of inappropriate behaviour when teaching at a special needs school in Aberdeen, but will still be allowed to teach.

Ms Bloice was heard saying 'don't wake the beast' when a child fell asleep in class and when asked if pupils had finished their morning snacks she said: 'Yes - let the beasts free'.

The teacher and musician also referred to another pupil as 'a f****** little s***' when talking to a volunteer.

A fitness-to-teach panel found some of the charges proven against Ms Bloice but ruled that she should not be barred from teaching.

The General Teaching Council (GTC) for Scotland heard how the incidents came as Ms Bloice taught at a special school in Aberdeen.

She told the hearing in Edinburgh that she used the word ‘beast’ after a reference to a pupil as ‘sleeping beauty’ from Beauty and the Beast.

She said that was because of the child's pattern of challenging behaviour before lunchtime and her habit of falling asleep after lunch.

She claimed that was a long-standing joke among members of the classroom team.

Ms Bloice was also heard to call a pupil 'a boot’ during the same period in September 2011.

Ms Bloice admitted she told a school volunteer about a pupil and said ‘I'd really like to write in his book that he has been a f****** little s*** today but I can't’.

On another occasion Ms Bloice was 
found to have ‘forcibly’ taken a pupil outside who struggled to keep up 
with her - although the panel agreed that no suffering was caused.

The
panel agreed that Ms Bloice ‘failed to maintain appropriate boundaries,
avoid improper contact. with pupils and respect her unique position of 
trust as a teacher.’

Inappropriate: Ms Bloice had told a school volunteer that she wanted to write that a pupil at the special needs school was a 'f****** little s***' in his book (file photo)

They also said her behaviour ‘had the potential to damage the confidence which the public have in her as a teacher as well as teaching as a profession’ and her banter was ‘inappropriate’ and ‘unprofessional’.

But instead of removing her from the teaching register she will instead be forced to comply with strict conditions at her current school.

A Conditional Registration Order and Reprimand will last for two years.
