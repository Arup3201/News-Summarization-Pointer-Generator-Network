A Harvey, Louisiana man is dead after a neighbor’s gun discharged through their shared apartment wall, killing him in his sleep.

Rene O’Quin, 38, was discovered bleeding in his bed by his fiancé early Sunday.

The woman called police and investigators discovered O’Quin was dead from a single bullet to the head that is believed to have come from the adjoining apartment of Pierre Camese.

Unthinkable: Rene O'Quin was found dead in a pool of his own blood in his Harvey, Louisiana apartment after a neighbor's gun discharged through a shared wall and the buillet struck him in the head Sunday while he slept

According to the New Orleans Times-Picayune, detectives initially believed O’Quin’s wound was self-inflicted.

Accident: Pierre Camese is now charged with negligent homicide after the 12-guage shotgun he took to bed over the weekend allegedly discharged though a wall and killed neighbor Rene O'Quin

But after the Jefferson Parish Sheriff’s Office conclude the gunshot blast originated from the other side of the victim’s bedroom wall, Camese was taken into custody.

The 23-year-old has now been booked on negligent homicide, department spokesman Colonel John Fortunato told the Times-Picayune.

Investigators found that Camese was involved in a domestic abuse incident with an unidentified woman over the weekend and 911 had been called to the building.

When questioned, Camese revealed that he had taken a 12-guage shotgun to bed with him out of fear that the family of the woman with whom he had the dispute would come to harm him.

He’d placed the borrowed firearm on his bed, pointed toward the wall and claims it accidentally discharged when he pulled the bedcovers over himself.

Camese claims he had no idea someone had been shot.

He was booked Sunday on domestic abuse charges in addition to the negligent homicide charge.

Held: The tragedy occurred on this block of Destrehan Avenue in Harvey, Louisiana on Sunday. Police were called to Camese's apartment the day before for a domestic dispute. He was booked on abuse charges for that incident as well Sunday
