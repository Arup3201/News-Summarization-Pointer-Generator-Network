This is the dramatic moment an 88-year-old man was rescued after driving his car into a lake while suffering a suspected medical emergency.

The man, whose identity has not yet been revealed, remains in intensive care after driving his white Cadillac into the Sinclair Inlet near Bremerton in the U.S. state of Washington.

The accident took place shortly after 10am yesterday morning, and saw the man trapped inside his vehicle beneath 10 feet of water, 30 feet from the shore.

Saved: The elderly man was rescued by a firefighter, a police officer and two employees of a local boat manufacturer who had been testing new products nearby and witnessed the accident

Bremerton Police Department started receiving reports of a car driving into the water from the south end of Trenton Avenue in the Manette neighborhood at 10.03am yesterday.

A police officer and firefighter were the first to arrive at the scene and spotted the vehicle about 30 feet from the shore - suggesting it had been travelling at speed when it entered the water.

The men dived into the water and were joined by two employees of SAFE Boats - a local boat manufacturer who were already in the water testing new products when they witnessed the accident.

Using an axe he had carried into the water with him, the firefighter was able to break the car's windows and, with the help of the SAFE Boats employees, pull the man to the surface.

The group then dragged the elderly man to the shore where a police detective performed CPR and managed to get him breathing.

Rescue: The men dived into the water and swam out 30 feet to reach the vehicle. The distance it travelled into the lake is testament to how fast the man must have been driving when he ploughed into the water

While this was taking place the firefighter and a second police officer swam back to the car to be sure nobody else was trapped. They did not find anyone either in the vehicle or in the surrounding water.

Jim and Francoise Deighan were eyewitnesses to the incident and described the scene to the Bremerton Patriot newspaper.

'The car was traveling so fast. I said to my husband, 'He's going too fast. He's not going to be able to stop,' Mrs Deighan said.

She added that the vehicle, whose driver appeared not to apply his brakes, then hit a bump in the road and took flight - sailing between a tree and a house before hitting the water.

'I got my phone and called 911... Jim, he ran down to the water to try to help the man,' she said.

Treatment: After being rescued the man was taken to Harrison Hospital (pictured) in central Bremerton. He remains in intensive care. The firefighter was also taken to the facility to be treated for cuts

'It must have been something medical because he didn't try to stop. It was like he wasn't alert, Mrs Deighan added.

After being rescued the man was taken to Harrison Medical Center in central Bremerton. He remains at the hospital in intensive care.

The firefighter was also taken to the facility to be treated for cuts sustained during the rescue but was discharged later the same day.

The white Cadillac was later recovered from the water.
