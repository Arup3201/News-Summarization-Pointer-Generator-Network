Two little girls aged just two and six are in hospital after being struck by stray bullets while playing outside with a group of ten other children.

Suspect Luis Moore, 23, allegedly opened fire on target Ricky Rodriguez, 20, who was shot just hours after they had an argument, police said.

The incident on Monday evening in the Bronx, New York, left two-year-old Patience Boyd fighting for her life and Jayla Rodriguez, six, also injured.

Suspect: Luis Moore, 23, allegedly opened fire on intended target Ricky Rodriguez, 20, who was shot in the back hours after they had an argument, police said

A group of children and adults were outside in the street when a gunman suddenly appeared and fired shots from 50ft away, witnesses said.

People screamed and ran for cover, Amy Carrasquillo, 32, told the New York Times, after she had watched the incident from a nearby window.

‘The kids were playing and then they dropped,’ witness Jose Ortiz told the New York Daily News. ‘The guy was shooting crazy from the corner.’

The intended target Mr Rodriguez was left with a bullet wound in his lower back, while he was trying to protect a pregnant woman, witnesses said.

Police believe the incident may have been gang-related. Patience was hit in her left temple and Jayla was grazed in her neck.

Mr Rodriguez and Jayla, who are not related, were taken to hospital and are in a stable condition. But Patience was said to be in a critical condition.

‘The kids were playing and then they 
dropped. The guy was 
shooting crazy from the corner. Those little girls and that guy are like family to me. My daughter plays with those girls'

‘She wasn’t moving,’ Ms Carrasquillo said of Patience as she was loaded into an ambulance. ‘It’s heartbreaking.’

‘Those little girls and that guy are like family to me,’ Mr Ortiz told the New York Daily News. ‘My daughter plays with those girls.’

Moore is now in custody in connection with the shooting, police told NY1.

Mr Rodriguez was charged for weapons possession in February and menacing last December, reported the New York Post.

Only one week ago, 24-year-old mother Yaritza Pacheco was killed by a stray bullet only half a mile away from the latest incident.
