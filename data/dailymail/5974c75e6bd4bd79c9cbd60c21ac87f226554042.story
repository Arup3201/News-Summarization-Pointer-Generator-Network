Extraordinary: The squad are preparing to launch a civil claim against Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe, pictured last year leaving Number 10 Downing Street

The royal family’s armed bodyguards are threatening to sue Scotland Yard in a furious row over pay.

The highly-trained squad which shadows royals around the globe is in open revolt over changes that slash their lucrative overtime.

In an extraordinary move they are preparing to launch a civil claim against Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe.

It comes ahead of the Queen’s annual summer break in Balmoral, a trip which has traditionally substantially boosted pay packets.

But officers may soon receive a lump sum instead of hourly overtime, a system which in the past has seen some triple their pay.

The squad of close protection officers said they are being singled out and should be paid fairly for all the work they do.

But one former head of royal protection said he was ‘appalled’ by the decision, as protecting the monarch should be a ‘privilege’.

Retired Chief Superintendent Dai Davis said: ‘This is yet another example of challenging everything legally.

‘It is a privilege to guard the monarch of this country and I get very cross when I hear about this kind of attitude.

‘In my day, joining the police service was a vocation and something you did because you believed in it. I’m sad at the way things are going.’

Members of Scotland Yard’s SO14 royalty protection team claim they are being treated differently to other officers.

They are being offered up to £15,000-a-year to ‘buy out’ their overtime, meaning they only receive the lump sum no matter how much work they do.

The changes apply to several hundred plain-clothes close protection officers who shadow members of the Royal family.

It does not apply to uniformed guards or their counterparts who guard the Prime Minister and other senior politicians, diplomats or other VIPs.

The changes were the result of a review of police pay and conditions undertaken by former rail regulator Tom Winsor in 2010.

In the past Royal protection officers have earned huge sums in overtime, especially those responsible for globe-trotting royals such as the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge.

They are regarded as being on duty around the clock, so in some cases received three day’s pay for every day they are abroad, something known as ‘treble bubble.’

Royal protection officers have also been told they will not receive overnight or hardship allowances, which are worth around £50 and £30 respectively.

But they can continue to claim substantial expenses, details of which were revealed three years ago after a leak.

Internal documents revealed protection officers were claiming for everything from luxury hotels to swimwear and petty items such as sweets and cookies.

Royalty protection representatives have been locked in talks with the Police Federation and the Scotland Yard leadership for months.

One source close to the negotiations said officers have consulted a lawyer on taking legal action against Sir Bernard.

He said: ‘The hierarchy have been kicking this around for months and we are fed up.

‘Officers should be paid for what they do, including if they are away overnight and suffering hardship as a result.

‘These officers cannot have a life because they are living somebody else’s. To some it might sound wonderful.

‘But if you were to actually doing it yourself, staying in the kind of accommodation they do, getting your head down for just four or five hours a night, you might think differently.

‘It is because we do not have the manpower, we do not have the resources. The Home Office does not fund the amount of protection that is required.

‘They want people to work overtime but it does not appear they are prepared to pay for it.

‘If any of this was voluntary, if they were saying you can pick and choose, it would be more fair. But they are not.

‘The officers have urged the Police Federation to take legal action. We have got as far as getting legal advice.’

The Met spends more than £300,000 every day protecting high-profile people from Royals to senior politicians and visiting dignitaries.

The huge bill has been a source of friction between a series of commissioners and the Home Office.

Police claim the Government does not provide enough money to meet its costs and London taxpayers end up paying to meet the gap.

There have been a series of reviews about who gets bodyguards and when, leaving some minor royals with ‘slimmed down’ protection.

Among them were Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie who were stripped of their 24-hour protection, estimated to cost £500,000 a year.

Mr Davies said officers must do what the commissioner tells them ‘provided his orders are lawful’.

He added: ‘If they do not like that they can go back to real policing which arresting people in the street and catching burglars and paedophiles.

‘They are all volunteers. No-one forces them to be on duty. One of the motivations should be that this kind of work is a privilege.’

A Met spokesman confirmed the proposed changes are a result of the Winsor review of pay and conditions.

He said: ‘As a result of recommendations in that review, overtime and allowances across the protection command are being considered.

‘No decisions have been made at this time and officers will continue to be consulted throughout the process.

‘Like all public services the Metropolitan Police Service has to deliver value for money.’
