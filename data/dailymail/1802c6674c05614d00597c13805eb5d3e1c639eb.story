A student was fighting for his life tonight after overdosing on illegal hallucinogenic drugs bought on the internet.

Police said he was taken to hospital with five others early today having taken 2CB, which is similar to ecstasy.

The group of students, some from Newcastle University, were found at 3am when police raided a house in Jesmond, a suburb of Newcastle.

Raid: Raid: Police are investigating after six students were rushed to hospital after taking the illegal hallucinogenic drug 2CB

The six men – aged between 
19 and 22 – are at the Royal Victoria Infirmary, with the most 
seriously affected student described as ‘critical but stable’.

Some eight people were at the house 
when officers arrived and neighbours said they heard revellers coming 
and going into the early hours.

It appears there may have been a party at
the terraced house in Ripon Gardens, a street popular with students at 
the elite university.

Bev Faulder, a teaching assistant, 
said: ‘I heard them running around, shouting and carrying on. We’ve had a
lot of trouble with noise at night but they are a lovely bunch of lads 
when you see them during the day and I hope they’re all right.’

A total of eight people were at the property when officers arrived at about 3am during an apparent party at the house

Another, who did not want to be named, said: ‘I couldn’t sleep last night because there was a lot of noise. At around 2am I heard some taxis coming and going. There was a lot of boys’ banter.’

In November last year, the government banned mexxy and black mamba and made class B drugs.

Mexxy, which is sold as an 
alternative to ketamine was linked to two deaths and police have warned 
of the 'life-threatening effects' of black mamba.

A record 57 new legal highs were detected last year alone.

An European Union report said it had found that more than one new psychoactive drug went on the market every week.

Drug experts say while cocaine, ecstasy and amphetamines are the main players for those taking stimulants across Europe, they are now competing with a growing number of emerging synthetic drugs.

A third added: ‘I thought they were that sort of thing because there were often strange smells coming from the house.’

2CB is a Class A drug which often comes in purple capsules and is an hallucinogen related to ecstasy popular in Europe.

It is also sold as white powder or small pills and is particularly dangerous when mixed with other substances.

On the street, it is also known as Bromo, Nexus, CB, Performax, Spectrum, Venus, Erox or Cloud Nine.

A team of ten police officers were seen searching the house and appeared to be looking in the drains.

A
Northumbria police spokesperson said: ‘At this stage police believe 
they have taken an hallucinogenic drug called 2CB which at this stage is
believed has been bought over the internet.

‘The exact reason for hospitalisation 
is unclear at present and could be due to a suspected overdose or mixing
the drug with another substance, or a bad reaction.’

Neighbours said they had heard revellers coming and going from the house into the early hours

Officers are now warning students and other young people to beware the dangers of illegal drugs - especially those bought over the internet.

The relevant course heads at Newcastle University are understood to have been notified.
