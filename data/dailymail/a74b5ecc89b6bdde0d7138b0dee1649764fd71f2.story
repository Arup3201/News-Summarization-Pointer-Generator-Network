The Florida home of Casey Anthony's parents where her daughter Caylee died in 2008 has gone into foreclosure.

George and Cynthia Anthony are now facing eviction from their Mount Dora residence after NationStar Mortgage LLC filed foreclosure papers with the Orange County Register of Actions against the coupe last week.

The value of the house located in the 4900 block of Hopespring Drive is listed between $50,001 and $249,999, the notice of intent obtained by RadarOnline stated.

Facing eviction: George and Casey Anthony stand to lose their Mount Dora, Florida, home, which is once again in foreclosure

Home turf: The Anthonys' 4-bedroom, 2-bath home on Hopespring Drive has a listed value between $50,001 and $249,999

According to the real estate site 
Zillow.com, the Anthonys' 1,472-square-foot home was built in 1986 
featuring four bedrooms and two bathrooms. The couple bought it in 1989 
for $90,000.

This marks the second time that the Anthonys have found themselves on the brink of being ousted from their home.

In February 2010, Bank of America began the foreclosure process against the property, but eventually dropped the case, HLN-TV reported.

In
July, George and Cynthia Anthony made national headlines after selling 
off their dead granddaughter's toys and other items during a garage 
sale in an attempt to raise cash.

Casey Anthony has stayed out of the spotlight since she was acquitted of her daughter's death in July 2011 following a high-profile trial.

Last month, Anthony agreed to pay $75,000 to a Texas-based search charity that helped look for her missing daughter as part of a settlement.

The
mother reported her 2-year-old daughter Caylee Marie missing in the 
summer of 2008, 31 days after her daughter was last seen.

Disposal: Caylee Anthony with her mother Casey. The little girl disappeared in June 2008 and her body was found months later buried in a trash bag in Florida

Reminders: Cindy and George Anthony were reportedly selling off the toys and clothes of their dead granddaughter during a Florida yard sale last month

Following a massive manhunt, the
toddler's badly-decomposed body was found four months later buried in a trash bag in Florida woodland not far from George and Cynthia's home.

Anthony was charged with first-degree murder. At her trial in 2011, a
jury believed Anthony’s version of events that Caylee had accidentally 
drowned and she had panicked and buried the girl with her father George.

Although Anthony was found not guilty of murder in 2011, she was 
convicted of lying to police after it emerged that she had made up her 
explanation of why Caylee was missing.

She
claims to be nearly $800,000 in debt thanks to heavy legal fees, and a 
bankruptcy trustee has sought to sell off the rights to her life story 
in order to pay her bills.

Tragedy: Caylee Anthony's remains were found buried in a trash bag after she went missing in 2008 in Florida. A jury decided that she had accidentally drowned and her mother Casey was acquitted of murder

Hiding: Casey Anthony, pictured in March this year, has been seen little since she was acquitted of her daughter's murder two years ago
