Photographs from The Beatles' record-breaking Shea Stadium show are to go under the hammer this month to mark 50 years since the band released their debut album.

The 61 pictures, taken by amateur photographer Marc Weinstein, are expected to fetch £15,000 at the sale at Omega Auctions in Stockport on March 22.

The black and white shots capture the Liverpudlian four-piece at the peak of Beatlemania as they began a US tour.

The auction on March 22 marks 50 years since the release of the band's first album Please Please Me - including a collection of their Shea Stadium gig

The copyright of these photographs is included in the sale at Omega Auctions in Stockport on March 22

The August 1965 concert, compered by television star Ed Sullivan, was one of the world's first big outdoor stadium gigs - and even the 2,000 security staff couldn't stop the overexcited crowd charging towards the stage.

Screams from the fans were so loud that the music could not be heard through the amps - and turning on the stadium's system used during baseball games didn't help either.

The brief set, consisting of 12 songs in half an hour, raked in $304,000 - then the biggest grossing event in showbiz history.

The collection is up for sale alongside rare Beatles vinyl and memorabilia to mark half a century to the day since the release of Please Please Me, the band's first album.

The winning bidder also wins the copyright for the photographs - so will be free to do whatever they want with them.

Record label Parlophone rushed through recording 14 songs for Please Please Me with producer George Martin after the single of the same name topped the New Musical Express and Melody Maker charts.

Last year, Rolling Stone magazine ranked the album as the 39th greatest of all time, in its top 500 list.

It also voted I Saw Her Standing There and the title track into its top 500 greatest songs of all time, at 139th and 184th respectively.
