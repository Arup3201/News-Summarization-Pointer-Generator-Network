Acquitted: Sandor Kepiro, 97, was on trial for war crimes dating back 69 years

A 97-year-old man was sensationally cleared of committing war crimes during World War II today.

The charges stemmed from a raid by pro-Nazi Hungarian forces in Serbia.

Sandor Kepiro had been charged by prosecutors of involvement in the killing of some 35 people.

The killings took place during an anti-partisan raid in the Serbian city of Novi Sad, which was then under Hungarian control, on January 23, 1942.

Hungary was a member of the Axis powers - allied with Germany, Italy and Japan - from 1940, participating in the 1941 invasion of Yugoslavia, of which Serbia was then part.

Prosecutors had claimed that unidentified members of a patrol under Kepiro's command killed four people during the raid.

Kepiro, at the time a gendarmerie captain, was also suspected of being involved in the deaths of around 30 others who were executed on the banks of the Danube River.

Many of the dozens of people 
attending the court session cheered and clapped after judge Bela Varga 
read out the verdict of the three-member tribunal.

Kepiro,
 who returned to Hungary in 1996 after decades in Argentina, was 
discovered living in Budapest in 2006 by Nazi-hunters with the Simon 
Wiesenthal Center.

Before reading out the verdict, Mr Varga said Kepiro had been brought to the tribunal by ambulance and had spent the past week in hospital after apparently being given the wrong medication.

In a statement from Kepiro read out at the start of the court session, he rejected all the charges.

Frail: He was accused of ordering the deaths of Serbian civilians in World War II

Trial: The court can sit for only 90 minutes each day because of the defendant's poor health

'I am innocent. I never killed, never stole. I served my country,' said the statement read out by Kepiro's psychologist, who added that Kepiro said he returned to Hungary from Argentina in 1996, 'because for him without Hungary there is no life.'

Unusually, the verdict is being given over two days, today and tomorrow, because only two court sessions of 45 minutes can be held daily due to Kepiro's frail health.

Captain: Kepiro, shown here during the war, was a captain in the Hungarian army, allied to the Nazis

After Varga cleared him of the charges, Kepiro - who sat in a wheelchair during the session, had an IV drip in his arm and did not speak - was taken out of the courtroom by paramedics upon the request of his lawyer, Zsolt Zetenyi. After a brief recess, the judge continued reading out the full ruling, with only Mr Zetenyi representing the defence.

Serbia's war crime prosecutor and representatives of the Simon Wiesenthal Center attended the session, leaving the courtroom after the verdict was announced.

Efraim Zuroff, who brought Kepiro's 
case to light in 2006, earlier described the proceedings as 'one of the 
last major trials' of Holocaust-era war criminal suspects.

In
 1941, after the Nazi occupation of Yugoslavia, Hungarian forces entered
 northern Serbia, which sided with the Allies during the war and had 
been part of Hungary until World War I. In early 1942, those Hungarian 
forces carried out raids to counter the growing number of partisan 
attacks.

Kepiro said that 
his task was to supervise the identification of people being rounded up,
 but he claimed to be unaware of the killings until after they had been 
carried out. About 800 Serbs and 400 Jews are thought to have been 
killed in the raids.

In January 1944, Kepiro and several other officers were convicted of disloyalty by a military court for their role in the Novi Sad raids.

The 10-year prison sentence, of which Kepiro served a few weeks, was later annulled and his rank reinstated.

Survivors: The victims of Hungarian raids in Serbia - like Rodoljub Malencic, left, and Elvira Fisova - are angry about the verdict

Before Kepiro's trial, the last man to be accused of Nazi-era war crimes was John Demjanjuk, a retired autoworker from Ohio, convicted in May of 28,060 counts of accessory to murder by a Munich court.

Demjanjuk today became the subject of a new investigation, which accuses him of guarding not only the Sobibor death camp, for which he has already been convicted, but also the Flossenbuerg concentration camp.

His case was the first time someone was convicted on evidence of being a guard alone, without evidence of a specific killing.

Attorney Cornelius Nestler says his goal in filing the new complaint is to expand the precedent to apply to concentration camp guards as well as death camp guards.
