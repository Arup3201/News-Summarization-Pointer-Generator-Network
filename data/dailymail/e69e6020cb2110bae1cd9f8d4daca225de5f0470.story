Tiffany Porter beat Jessica Ennis-Hill's British record as she took silver in the women's 100m hurdles at the IAAF Continental Cup in Marrakech on Sunday.

Porter recorded a new best of 12.51 seconds behind American Dawn Harper, beating by three hundredths of a second the mark set by Ennis-Hill during her victorious London 2012 heptathlon campaign.

Her success capped an impressive two months for Porter, who won the European title in Zurich last month in a slower winning time of 12.76 seconds.

Zurich silver medallist Will Sharman had to settle for bronze in the men's 110m hurdles in a time of 13.25 seconds behind Sergey Shubenkov of Russia and American Ronnie Ash.

Jo Pavey took bronze in the women's 5000m behind winner Almaz Ayana of Ethiopia and Kenya's Joyce Chepkirui.

The 40-year-old, who became the oldest female European champion in history in August when she won the 10,000m title, finished in time of 15 minutes 58.67 seconds.
