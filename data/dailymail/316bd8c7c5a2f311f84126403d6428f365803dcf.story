West Ham forward Mauro Zarate has completed a loan move to London rivals Queens Park Rangers.

The 27-year-old, who joined the Hammers from Argentine side Velez Sarsfield in the summer, has failed to land himself a first-team spot at Upton Park.

QPR manager Harry Redknapp unveiled his latest signing on Tuesday afternoon.

'We're really pleased to bring Mauro in. He's a good footballer, someone with great ability who can play as a No 10,' Redknapp said. 

'He's a more than capable player, he's already shown that, and hopefully he can come in here and do well for us.' 

Redknapp has made no secret of his desire to add at least one more striker to his squad in January and the Rangers manager believes Zarate fits the bill.

Redknapp recently said: 'It's important to have options up front. You need somebody else to weigh in with goals. We can't rely on Charlie (Austin) getting all the goals.'

Zarate has scored two goals in seven league appearances for West Ham this season but has struggled for a starting spot ahead of Diafra Sakho, Enner Valencia and Andy Carroll.

Hammers boss Sam Allardyce recently responded to claims he had treated Zarate unfairly by insisting the 27-year-old had simply not been good enough to secure a regular place in the side. 

Harry Redknapp will be hoping Zarate will lift the pressure of QPR striker Charlie Austin by scoring goals
