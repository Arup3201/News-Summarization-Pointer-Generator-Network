At White Hart Lane on Sunday, Mauricio Pochettino has to make the biggest decision of his short career as head coach of Tottenham: Emmanuel Adebayor cannot play.

The striker's lack of commitment at Villa Park last Sunday, when he was dragged off after 58 minutes, was not just an affront to his team-mates, it was an insult to the sport itself.

For Pochettino to make his mark at Spurs, to show the players that he really is the boss, Adebayor cannot be in that team to face Stoke City.

Time on pitch: 58 minutes 

Goals: 0 Shots: 2 On target: 2

Touches: 32 (see touch map below) 

Passes: 25 Completed: 20 (80 per cent)

Challenges: 5 Challenges won: 1

Lost Ball: 8 times Recoveries: 0 

Fouls: 1 Offsides: 1 

To make a decision as big as this, to tell a 30-year-old forward who has played for Monaco, Arsenal, Manchester City and Real Madrid, that he no longer justifies his selection will not be easy.

Sure, he could play against Stoke at the weekend, he could add to his tally of two goals for Spurs this season and everyone can pretend all is well with the world again. It wouldn’t last.

Adebayor’s dwindling number of supporters will often stand up for him and tell you ‘he is unplayable on his day’.

It has been an awful long time since anyone has been able to say that about the Togolese striker. A couple of years, or more, perhaps.

In 2009, when he was still at Arsenal, he scored the best goal of his career inside El Madrigal during a Champions League clash with Villarreal.

Adebayor, then one of the most feared and accomplished strikers in Europe, still regards that overhead kick as one of his personal favourites. It has not always gone so well.

In the past three seasons, since his permanent move to London from Manchester City after a spell on loan at White Hart Lane and time at Real Madrid, he has scored 24 goals. Not good enough.

His two this season were one in the 4-0 rout of QPR at White Hart Lane and a header in the 2-1 home defeat against Newcastle.

For the long-term health and benefit of this Tottenham team, Pochettino has to stand up to a senior player and show that he is prepared to take the big decisions.

Adebayor went through the motions last Sunday, plodding around the pitch until the Spurs fans singing ‘Harry Kane, he is one of us’ finally got their way.

By that stage Adebayor had touched the ball just 32 times and failed to round Brad Guzan when he was put through one-on-one with the Villa keeper.

Adebayor’s heart just doesn't seem to be in it anymore and that attitude is transmitting itself to the rest of the team.

Roberto Soldado, who scored a beauty at Villa Park in their win there the previous season under Andre Villas-Boas, looks shot to bits alongside him.

Christian Eriksen, shunted out to the right at Villa when he should be playing in a central role, is a far better player than his form suggests.

Since he moved permanently to Tottenham, Emmanuel Adebayor has not impressed...

Younes Kaboul, the captain, Etienne Capoue, Danny Rose and Kyle Naughton are among those suffering in this Spurs team when they play in the Premier League.

The momentum is with the youngster Kane, a striker with the fraction of Adebayor’s ability. He has the heart of a lion, though.

When he replaced Adebayor, his striking work-rate galvanised this Tottenham team.

It would be a brave man to argue that it was anything other than the presence of Kane, sprinting everywhere and hustling Villa defenders, that brought Spurs back into this game.

In the final minute he showed some admirable qualities when he told Erik Lamela, another substitute, that he would be taking the free-kick that led to Tottenham’s winner.

Kane knows he is on to a good thing and his endearing celebration in front of the Spurs fans in the Doug Ellis Stand only adds to his allure. He is a talismanic figure.

There is an enthusiasm about his game, a first class attitude and a desire to play, whatever the circumstances or the adversity.

Sadly those days are over for Adebayor. Last season, after being isolated by Villas-Boas, the re-integration process began under Tim Sherwood.

He responded with a few goals, scoring 14 by the time Sherwood was sacked by Spurs chairman Daniel Levy at the end of the season.

Getting a full 90 minutes out of him these days is not easy and Pochettino has to address this growing problem.

The fall-out, of course, could run into days, if not weeks, if Adebayor reacts badly. We have been here before with him.

Sherwood spoke of ‘managing men’ when he replaced Villas-Boas, but the Spurs forward should be able to manage himself after the clubs he has played for.

In January, it is time for Pochettino to tell him to find another.
