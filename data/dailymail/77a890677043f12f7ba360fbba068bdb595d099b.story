The Obama administration said on Friday that the Internal Revenue Service sent incorrect tax information to about 800,000 Americans who enrolled in new medical insurance plans through Healthcare.gov.

The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the Health and Human Services subagency that handles Obamacare, sent them forms that contained an error which would cause them to miscalculate the government subsidy for their insurance policies.

That, the administration admitted, would change the amount of their tax refunds, or change the amount they owe.

A source at the Treasury Department told Daily Mail Online that of about 80,000 people who have already filed their taxes on the basis of the flawed information, it is expected that 50,000 will have to file again.

GLITCH: The IRS sent 800,000 Obamacare customers  the wrong subsidy information for their tax returns

PLAYING DEFENSE: WHite House Press Secretary Josh Earnest insisted on Friday that most of the people who got Obamacare tax credits received the right form, but didn't dispute the more embarrassing numbers

The Department of Health and Human Services, not the IRS, announced the glitch – in a blog post.

Information 'needs to be corrected,' HHS said, but new forms will not be available until next month. 

'This does not mean that your tax credit was incorrect; this is purely an error in what was printed on the form,' the blog explained.

Republicans were quick to pounce.

'The Obama administration has built a healthcare law so complex, so confusing, and so costly that even they don't know how to properly administer it,' Tennessee GOP Rep. Diane Black said in a statement.

Officially, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services said in a statement that 'affected individuals who have not yet filed their taxes should wait to file until they receive their corrected form.'

'For affected individuals who have already filed their taxes, the IRS and Treasury are currently reviewing the issue and will be providing additional information shortly.'

A Treasury Department spokesperson stuck to that line despite the emergence of hard numbers from inside the agency.

'I’m not disputing those numbers,' a Treasury Department spokesperson told Daily Mail Online. 

'My point is that all we’ve said is that we’ll have additional information for those people shortly.' 

White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest told reporters Friday afternoon that the HHS snafu 'only has an impact on those who are likely to qualify for a tax credit.'

'The vast majority of people who received this form got the correct version of it,' he claimed.

California's self-administered insurance marketplace had a similar problem this week that will affect nearly 100,000 people.

The latest cringeworthy moment in Obamacare's history follows a 2013 launch that saw millions unable to reach the government''s marketplace website.

More than 50,000 Americans will have to file their taxes a second time

CAN YOU PASS THIS TEST? The IRS has a new form for people to calculate how medical insurance subsidies affect their tax refunds

This time about 1 in 11 Obamacare enrollees for 2015 will need new tax papers from Health and Human Services.

Of those who received subsidies to lower their insurance premiums, about 1 in 5 are affected.

Americans for Tax Reform blamed the problem on 'the dysfunctional healthcare.gov bureaucrac.'

'800,000 families are literally caught in limbo until healthcare.gov gets its act together,' the group said.

With the U.S. labor participation rate at a 37-year low and the economy only beginning a tepid rebound, those people will need to wait for refunds that could make or break their families' finances. 

Meanwhile, the government has created a special extended Obamacare enrollment period for Americans who say they were unaware that failing to sign up by Feb. 15 could result in hefty fines.
