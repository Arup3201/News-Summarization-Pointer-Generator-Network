This dramatic video shows the moment that a car with a four-year-old passenger flipped and landed in a field after the driver led police on a three-minute chase.

Driver Scott Tony Smith, who was banned from the roads, reached speeds of almost 100mph as he was pursued by police through County Durham after being caught driving too quickly.

The car, an MG ZT, is seen weaving in and out of traffic on residential roads before speeding on to rural lanes - where it flips over a hedge and into a field after emerging from a T-junction at dangerous speed.

Chase: The chase started after the car, driven by Scott Tony Smith, was seen speeding through County Durham. Officers reached speeds of almost 100mph in their pursuit of the vehicle, an MG ZT

Dangerous: After chasing Smith through a number of County Durham villages, police follow the car on to more rural roads. They are just moments behind the car when it  shoots out from a T-junction (above)

Flipped: The car lifts into the air and flips over, before landing in a field. Smith, the boy, and the boy's mother, who was also travelling in the vehicle, all escaped the incident without any major injuries

Smith, the boy and the boy's mother, who was also in the car, all escaped without major injuries, despite the child not being seated in a secure child seat, Durham Crown Court was told. 

Police chased Smith, 23, through the villages of The Middle and Craghead after asking him to pull over in South Stanley.

Driver: Smith, who was driving the car, was banned from the road at the time of the dangerous chase. Above, the 23-year-old outside court today

At one stage, the camera, mounted on the police car, captures the video as it runs a red light and mounts a kerb to avoid oncoming traffic on a restricted road where roadworks were taking place.

The pursuit reached its dramatic conclusion when the car shot out from a T-junction and flew over a hedge opposite. 

It is captured flipping in the air before landing in a farm field. 

The footage will be shown when Smith appears in court to be sentenced after pleading guilty to four charges relating to the incident, which took place on October 29. 

He admitted dangerous driving, driving while disqualified, failing to stop for police, and a child cruelty charge.

Tony Davis, representing Smith, told the court that in the circumstances of the incident, by his admission to dangerous driving, the defendant has no defence to the child cruelty charge.

'The child in the car was not in a secure child seat. He has no legal defence to it, and that's why he's pleaded "guilty" to it.'

Adjourning sentence to allow for preparation of a probation report, Judge Robert Adams told Smith: 'In ordering the pre-sentence report, I'm giving you no promises as to the sentence.

'All options will remain open to the court.'

Smith, Stanley, County Durham, who remains disqualified from driving, was bailed to return for sentence in the week beginning January 19.

Reckless: Smith, who was banned from driving, is filmed as he weaves the car through traffic on single-carriageway roads. At one point the silver car mounts a kerb (pictured) in his attempt to escape police

Terrifying: The car flipped over a hedge and into a field after emerging from a T-Junction too quickly. The dramatic moment, pictured above, was captured by a police camera mounted to the pursuing vehicle
