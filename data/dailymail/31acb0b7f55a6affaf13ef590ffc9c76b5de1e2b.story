If you’re giving the gift of gold this Christmas, this is one present that anyone would love to find under the tree.

London-based Goldgenie is selling a men’s racing bicycle covered in 24-carat gold plating, making it one of the most luxurious in the world.

With an eye-watering price tag of £250,000, it is worth more than a Ferrari and could prove to be a unique toy for one of the capital’s super-rich residents.

Almost every inch of the bicycle is covered in gold, including its handlebar, chain and spokes

If gold plating isn’t enough, the company can have the ‘ultimate once-in-a-lifetime luxury gift’ encrusted with jewels.

Billed as ‘a mobile golden masterpiece’, the bicycle turned heads when Goldgenie took it for a spin near its offices in Westminster.

Frank Fernando, director of Goldgenie, said: ‘It’s the most amazing piece of movable sculpture in the world.

‘This particular bike comes in at just under £250,000 but we as a company embellish and diamond encrust, which is what my intentions are with this bike to the requirements of any potential customer.’

Mr Fernando added: ‘We’ve just recently had an enquiry for, believe it or not, for a 24-carat gold plated toilet … including the seat and the commode and also a 24-carat gold vibrator.’

And the bicycle is no one-off, with Mr Fernando saying additional orders are already coming in.
