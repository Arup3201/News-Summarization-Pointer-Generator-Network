Louis van Gaal has revealed his New Year's resolution is to make Manchester United the top team in the country by the end of 2015 but acknowledges they will have to improve their away form for that to happen.

United travel to League One Yeovil in a potential FA Cup banana skin on Sunday and while the club are on a 10-match unbeaten run, they have only drawn their last three away games at Stoke, Tottenham and Aston Villa.

Van Gaal, who saw his side embarrassingly dumped out of the Capital One Cup 4-0 at MK Dons, is taking no chances with the trip to Huish Park and has had Gary Johnson's underdogs watched three times by his scouting team.

Louis van Gaal wants to lead Manchester United to the top of the Premier League table by the end of 2015

United drew for the third successive away game against Stoke on New Year's Day

Tottenham 0-0 Manchester United - Dec 28

Aston Villa 1-1 Manchester United - Dec 20

But ambitions for his first full calendar year at Old Trafford are far grander. Having spent £150million on star names like Angel di Maria, Falcao Daley Blind and Marcos Rojo in the summer and six months in which to impose his philosophy on the club, van Gaal thinks overtaking Chelsea and Manchester City has to be the target.

'2014 was very exciting for me and my players. I hope we can continue and for the fans we are number one in the league at the end of this year,' he proclaimed.

'You always want that perfect game as a manager and so we need to improve the process and our performances. You saw at Stoke we didn't play the perfect game, we started very badly and lost two points away. We have to improve that because otherwise you can not be champions.'

Shinji Kagawa, Michael Keane, Danny Welbeck and Nick Powell were either sold or sent out on loan within a week of the MK Dons debacle and van Gaal promises there will be no similar capitulation this time, even if he reshuffles his pack after four matches in 10 days, and drafts in young defenders Tyler Blackett and Paddy McNair.

'I can say that in general my players always fight to the end. We showed against Stoke City we had the team spirit to fight back and try and get a victory despite a very horrible start,' he vowed.

'It is more difficult to prepare for Yeovil than a Premier League team but we have had them watched and analysed because we are professionals and have to prepare games like professionals, because we know it will not be easy. It is a matter of you win or you are dead.'

How United and Yeovil compare ahead of FA Cup third round tie at Huish Park on Sunday

Manchester United haven't won the FA Cup for 11 years and Darren Fletcher is the only survivor of the 2004 team that beat Millwall in the final, though Robin van Persie and Juan Mata have won the trophy for other clubs. Twice, United have needed replays to beat non-league opposition Burton Albion and Exeter City and only scraped past another Conference side Crawley Town 1-0 in 2011.

Defender Phil Jones says the fact the majority of players including Wayne Rooney and himself have not won the FA Cup raises the importance of Sunday's trip to Huish Park.

'We all want to play because it's a game we want to win and progress in. The FA Cup is going to be a big competition for us this season.We are not in the Champions League so there is even more of an expectation to go and put a performance on at Yeovil,' he said.

Phil Jones has emphasised the importance of the FA Cup ahead of the third round clash

'It won't be an easy game down there. We know that. People might think we will go there and walk all over Yeovil but it won't be like that at all.

'League form doesn't matter and what happened against MK Dons is a reminder to us. We can't let that happen again.'

'I didn't play that game, I was at home watching on TV. It was very disappointing watching it, we have to make sure there is no repeat.

'The FA Cup is a massive competition especially for the British lads in the squad growing up watching the FA Cup draw and the games.'
