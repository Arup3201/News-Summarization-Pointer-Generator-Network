The £99 pastel-coloured coat from Zara is flying off the shelves

With Spring already on our doorsteps, it is hardly a surprise our wardrobes are becoming brighter.

And this season it seems yellow is the colour of the high-street’s sell-out coat.

Zara has seen its £99.99 pale yellow collarless cover-up flying off the shelves after fashionistas gave it the nod.

Demand for the zip-front, double-pocket item rocketed in the past month as temperatures soared well-above the average for the March.

Already celebrities and fashion gurus have ditched their drab, wintery wardrobe staples and opted for brighter, ‘feel-good’ clothes.

According to the Spanish high-street chain, the minimal, sixties-inspired style has been keeping shop assistants on their toes as they are repeatedly having to replenish stocks of the coat.

A sales assistant at the Oxford Street branch in London said: ‘We can’t sell enough of them.

‘We’re selling more than 30 of them a day in this store.’

Fashion magazine editors endorsed the statement coat – which ticks of one of the season’s trends of pale colours. They have teamed the coat with jeans or skinny trousers.

Georgia Simmonds, features assistant at Elle magazine, said: ‘The bright colour and 1960s shape shout summer, even if weather disagrees.’

Jessica Hogan, Vogue’s beauty and health editor, said that ‘it’s the sartorial equivalent of adding a slick of red lip stick – it gives you the same lift.’

And it is not just Zara that is seeing yellow and pastel coloured clothes flying off the shelves.

Figures have risen by 25 per cent at Fenwick, where By Malene Birger yellow jackets and skirts have almost sold out.

Also proving popular are pale pink items by DKNY and Paule Ka.

Natalie Kingham, head of the Matches Fashion website, said: ‘There’s been an uplift in sales on light, summery shades.’

Actress Karen Gillan wore a floor length pale pink dress, covered in sequins, as she arrived to a shoot for new TV show Selfie at the weekend.

Amy Childs from The Only Way is Essex stepped out in a yellow coat earlier this month, in addition to skinny jeans and beige stilettos.

Coronation Street actress Michelle Keegan also wore a pale large-collared grey coat on a night out in Manchester last week.

At Harrods, a pale leather Balenciaga biker jacket has been selling faster than the black version and pale-shade coats and tops by Chloe, Nina Ricci and Christopher Kane are doing remarkably well.In many instances they are having to be re-ordered, according to Helen David, fashion director at the store.
