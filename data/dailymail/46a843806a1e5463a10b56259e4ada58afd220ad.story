Atlanta is taking action against its subway elevators being used as bathrooms and has begun installing first-of-its-kind urination detectors in stations.

The city's MARTA subway system elevators are being fitted with a row of ten floor-height splash detectors along both side walls, Gizmodo.com reported.

The first elevator that was transformed to a no-go zone saw its incident rate drop to just one offender - who was swiftly arrested while in the act.

MARTA's director, Tom Beebe, planned 
the operation, with a goal of improving Atlanta's bad smelling subway 
reputation and catch the rogue urinaters.

He told Atlanta's WSBTV: 'If somebody was to urinate in here, there's going to be a splash factor.'

That splash triggers the UDD and an alarm that has MARTA police officers on the scene within seconds.

Each urination detector system costs 
$10,000 and with 111 elevators in Atlanta's subway system, MARTA will be
 facing a hefty bill to put a stop to public urination.

More
 systems will be installed around the citry starting in January and 
MARTA officials also plan on installing better lighting, security 
cameras and reopen restrooms in some stations.

Budget cuts in the past saw many subway restroom facilities shut down in 2010 during the recession.
