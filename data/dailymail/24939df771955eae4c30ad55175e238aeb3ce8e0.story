He plays fearless store boss Harry Selfridge in ITV’s new Sunday night drama, but in real life actor Jeremy Piven seems to be very afraid – of going bald.

Piven, 47, star of  Mr Selfridge, is understood to have had a £9,000 strand-by-strand hair transplant to reverse hair loss that began in his early 20s.

When he appeared in sitcom Ellen in the Nineties, he looked considerably less hirsute than these days.

Photographs of the actor taken in Hawaii in 2010 showed him with a large scar on the back of his head.

He said it was the result of surgery to conceal an old scar from  an acting injury.

But a top cosmetic surgeon said it was indicative of a ‘strip method’ hair transplant, where hair is cut out and transplanted, strand-by-strand, into thinning areas.

Dr Bessam Farjo of the Farjo Medical Centre in London – whose clients have included Dragons’ Den tycoon Duncan Bannatyne – said: ‘From the picture, I would say he has had around 3,000 grafts, costing up to £9,000.’

Piven refused to discuss whether he had had the procedure when contacted by The Mail on Sunday.

But whatever his secret, it seems to have had the desired result – he was spotted on a date last week in London with 24-year-old Alexandra Burke, the 2008 X Factor winner.

They spent the evening at LouLou’s nightclub following GQ magazine’s Men’s Fashion Week party.

The couple left separately but met again in the lobby of the Corinthia Hotel just after 3am.
