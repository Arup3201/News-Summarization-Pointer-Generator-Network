Sports fans will be able to pay a £9.99 rate to watch Premier League football, the first time games have been made available to non-Sky subscribers.

BSkyB's deal will allow unlimited 24-hour access online via the NOW TV website to its six Sky Sports channels.

It is a radical change for the company, 
part owned by Rupert Murdoch, as they have spent 20 years trying to tie 
people to packages costing in excess of £42.50 a month for Sky Sports.

The turnaround will be a godsend to people who only watch the occasional big match, can't make it to the pub or are stuck in an office with no TVs while a game featuring their team in taking place.

Deal: Manchester United's Wayne Rooney scores against Southampton in the Premier League last night, and BSkyB has announced today it will allow people to watch Sky Sports for £9.99 a day online

The concept will allow anyone the chance to watch Premier League football matches from this spring.

It will also include the Ryder Cup, The Ashes and Formula One races.

On weekends, when up to half a dozen live football matches from England, Scotland and Spain are shown, £9.99 could work out at less than £1.50 per match. However, initial reaction online appears to be lukewarm.

Offer: Sports addicts will be able to watch channels like Sky Sports News, presented by Hayley McQueen, for the first time with a daily rate

On Twitter @ribs909 said: '£9.99 a week would be more realistic', while @baggers1967 said: 'be surprised if there is a big take up at that price. Wouldn't a more realistic price be about £4 per day?

Another tweeter @matmurray wrote: 'Well it's massive as it's the first PPV (pay-per-view) on-demand Premiership football, but yeah, the price is a total joke.'

Its NOW TV website already offers online access 
to Sky Movies to compete with rivals LoveFilm and 
Netflix.

A promotion campaign prompted some 25,000 
customers to sign up to NOW TV in the last three months of 2012, according to 
BSkyB.

Sky has more than 10million subscribers, half of which subscribe to their HD service.

However, the company almost went bust in the early 1990s after a battle with other satellite TV companies.

But it was Sky's decision to buy the rights to show Premier League football from 1992 that helped save the business.

Today the satellite broadcaster reported an eight per cent rise in operating profits to £647million in the six months to December 31. Revenues at the group were up 5 per cent to £3.5billion.

Departure: For 20 years BSkyB has worked on a subscription-basis for its channels but this will change from this spring

Sky said price hikes, including a rise of £1 for its Sky Sports package and £1.50 for its Sky entertainment package, had helped drive the revenue growth.

Dundee United v Rangers                  12.45pm  Scottish Cup

QPR v Norwich                                    12.45pm Premier League                     

Crawley Town v Swindon Town          5.20pm  League One    

Espanyol v Levante                              6.55pm La Liga                          

Granada v Real Madrid                            9pm La Liga                      

It gained 80,000 new customers in that period, up from the 48,000 in the previous quarter to reach a total of 10.74million. Average revenues per user rose by £24 on a year earlier to £568.

The group also added 132,000 new broadband customers, including 38,000 new standalone customers in the period.

The group reported a standout performance from its Sky Sports channel, with record audiences when Europe beat the US in the Ryder Cup and Andy Murray won his first grand slam in the US Open.

It also attracted 9million viewers to its first season of Sky Sports Formula One channel.

Its Sky Sports on Sky Go service, where users can watch television on their mobile phones and tablet computers, registered a record 234,000 unique users for live coverage of the Manchester derby in December.

Shares in BSkyB were up 19.25p to 829.25p in early trading.
