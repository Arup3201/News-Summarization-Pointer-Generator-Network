Savvy punters take note of a horse’s breeding – but at County Kerry yesterday, they were probably more impressed by the heritage of a jockey.

Lester Piggott’s 19-year-old son Jamie took part in his first professional race, riding Pivotal Rock in the 2.55 at Killarney.

A flurry of bets fuelled by sentiment, and perhaps a Guinness or two, saw his odds tumble from 10-1 to 6-1 in the space of two hours.

Like father, like son: Jamie Piggott, 19, pictured left yesterday as he made his horse racing debut. His father Lester is pictured right aged 16. By the time he was Jamie's age he had already become a regular winner

Then, when a hotly-fancied horse was ruled out by a bruised foot, Pivotal Rock became the favourite.

Sadly, there was no fairytale ending: Jamie could only finish eighth out of 13 riders in the Grand Live Music Venue Handicap flat race.

His birth – the result of an affair between his father and his personal assistant, Anna Ludlow – resulted in Lester splitting his time between the homes of his mistress and his wife Susan, situated just a few miles apart in Newmarket.

Piggott Senior, 77, stayed away yesterday, perhaps mindful of the pressure his presence would pile on.

By Jamie’s age he had already secured the first of his nine Epsom Derby victories, having won his first race at just 12.

'I¿m planning to make a career of it': Piggott junior returns to the unsaddling enclosure after finishing eighth in the Killarney Grand Live Music Handicap. Bookies have him 50-1 to be champion jockey in the UK by 2019

His son remains upbeat. ‘It was good, I really enjoyed it,’ he said after the race. ‘It was a great experience and I’m planning to make a career of it.’

One bookmaker, Coral, is already quoting him at 50-1 to be champion jockey in the UK by 2019 – a title his father won 11 times.

He may not yet have his father’s winning touch – but he certainly has the looks of a champion.
