The family of James McNair, the comedian killed in the New Jersey Turnpike crash that also seriously injured Tracy Morgan, have settled a wrongful death claim with Wal-Mart.

The adult children of the 62-year-old comedian are said to be 'happy' with the undisclosed figure awarded for the accident on June 7 when a Wal-Mart 18-wheeler hit a limo carrying Morgan and his friend.

30 Rock star Morgan suffered a traumatic brain injury in the accident and his own lawsuit against Wal-mart is pending, while criminal charges against truck driver Kevin Roper are yet to be heard.

Pleased with the result of the case: Jamel and Danita McNair, the children of James McNair, are interviewed in New York on Wednesday about the outcome of their wrongful death suit against Wal-Mart

Attorney for the McNair family, Daryl Zaslow, told the Associated Press that terms of the settlement will be not be released.

Walmart 'accepted their responsibility by making this family more than whole,' said Zaslow.

'They caused extensive damage to this family and more than stepped up to the plate and took care of this family. Ultimately they did the right thing by the McNairs.'

He added, 'No amount of money can replace what they've lost, but what they've got will take care of them and allow them to move forward, and their father would be happy for that.'

Wal-Mart spokeswoman Brooke Buchanan said the company and the family worked closely to reach an agreement and that Wal-Mart was working toward settlements with others injured in the accident.

'We know there is nothing we can do to change what happened to Mr. McNair,' Buchanan said. 'We will continue to work to conclude all of the remaining issues as a result of the accident and we're committed to doing what's right.'

Deadly: James McNair was killed when the limo van he was traveling in was struck by an 18-wheeler on the New Jersey Turnpike on June 7

Pending: The charges against driver Kevin Roper are still pending and he is facing four counts of assault by auto and one count of death by auto

The out-of-court settlement between the company and the estate of James McNair is the first stemming from the June 7 crash in which a Wal-Mart truck slammed into a limo van carrying Morgan and the others home from a show in Delaware

The attorney added that McNair's children, 19-year-old Danita and 26-year-old Jamel have so far not made any public comments to the media since their father's death, until an interview with the Associated Press Today.

The settlement agreed between the McNair's and Wal-Mart allowed the Arkansas supermarket behemoth to admit no liability for the crash.

Roper, the truck driver, has been charged with death by auto and four counts of assault by auto for the summer crash in New Jersey.

The police allege that Roper had been driving his vehicle for more than 24 hours before the fatal crash.

In addition, an investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board found that Roper was driving up to 65 mph in a 45 mph zone just seconds before the crash.

Traumatic brain injury: Morgan, a former "Saturday Night Live" and "30 Rock" star, suffered a traumatic brain injury in the accident, according to his lawyer, and his lawsuit against Wal-Mart is proceeding in federal court
