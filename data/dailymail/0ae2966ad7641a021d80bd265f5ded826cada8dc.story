Impact: The painful moment when John O'Donaghue (black and white top) suffered a life threatening intestine puncture when he collided with his own goalkeeper during an amateur match

This is the moment a footballer suffered
a life-threatening injury during a collision with his own goalkeeper.

Club captain John O'Donoghue, 26, was defending a corner when he leapt in the air and collided with Christopher Pearce - puncturing his intestine.

Mr Pearce had charged out to punch away a cross and accidentally slammed into him. The keeper's left knee smashed straight into Mr Pearce's stomach - with the wince-inducing moment caught on camera.

Doctors say the force of the force of 
the collision ripped a 2cm hole in his intestine and Mr O'Donoghue immediately 
collapsed and was violently sick on the pitch.

A
player on the opposing side who works for the Royal Navy air rescue 
service immediately gave him first aid - but was unable to find a pulse.

He
was rushed to the Royal Cornwall Hospital with a life threatening 
injury and underwent emergency surgery for four hours as medics battled 
to save him.

Mr O'Donoghue, who
was hurt as his team lost 11-0 to local side Helston Athletic, is now 
recovering after suffering the horrific injury on Saturday afternoon as 
he played for non league side AFC Holsworthy in Devon.

Club
chairman Barry Parrish, 64, said: 'It was such a freak accident. A ball
came over from a corner and John went up to head it but our keeper also
jumped, leading with his knee and they clashed, with his knee hitting 
John in the stomach.

'The 
ref blew the whistle straight away, it was obvious that he was in a lot 
of pain. Luckily, a man from their team was qualified and realised the 
danger so he sorted everything out and called the ambulance who turned 
up very quickly.

Injury: Mr O'Donoghue is recovering in hospital after suffering the injury which happened during his side's 11-0 defeat at another amateur club - Helston Athletic

'He was 
completely flattened and his temperature was dropping, he was still in a
lot of discomfort at the hospital. He has had life-saving surgery.

Mr Parrish said Mr O'Donoghue is now on the mend and will hopefully be playing again sooner rather than later.

'In
all the years I have been in football I have seen some bad injuries but
I have never heard of anybody puncturing their intestines. He is lucky 
to be here,' he said.

Mr 
O'Donoghue's wife, Bethany, said: 'He underwent several scans that 
showed a lot of fluid in his stomach. They did emergency surgery and 
discovered a 2cm hole in his intestine.'
