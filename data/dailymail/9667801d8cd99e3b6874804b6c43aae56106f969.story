We could have less than 17 years to live - thanks to climate change, Bob Geldof has warned.

The 61-year-old Live Aid founder told young people at a conference in Johannesburg, South Africa, that there will be ‘a mass extinction event’ and admitted his generation had let down today’s youth.

Speaking to delegates from 189 countries, the former Boomtown Rats singer said 'we may not get to 2030' and warned: ‘The next war will not be a World War One or a World War Two - it will be the end.’

Mr Geldof, who was speaking at the One Young World summit, said: ‘The world can decide in a fit of madness to kill itself. Sometimes progress may not be possible. We're in a very fraught time.’

As young people shouted and blew on vuvuzela instruments at the Soccer City stadium, Mr Geldof added that young people must ‘get serious’ about how they can help, reported the Daily Telegraph.

He finished by telling delegates at the summit on Wednesday evening that he was sorry for being ‘bloody miserable’, adding that his advice would be to ‘just get on with it’.

Scientists warned last month that the Earth is set for more heatwaves, floods, droughts and rising sea levels that could swamp coasts and islands as greenhouse gases build up in the atmosphere.

But despite these dire predictions, they admitted global warming was likely to be more gradual than they previously thought and that world temperatures have barely changed in the past 15 years.

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change stated in its first report for six years that global warming is ‘unequivocal’ - and it is ‘95 per cent certain’ human activity is the ‘dominant’ cause.

But others questioned the credibility of the predictions, pointing out that the IPCC’s research had signally failed to predict the ongoing ‘pause’ in rising world temperatures.

Irishman Mr Geldof organised the Live Aid concert in 1985 in London and Philadelphia for the Ethiopian famine - and famously caused controversy by swearing at TV viewers to send money.

Then in 2005 he staged the Live 8 concert series in South Africa and the G8 states - France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the US, UK, Canada and Russia - to put pressure on the group to help Africa.
