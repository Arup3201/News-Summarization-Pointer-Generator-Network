A 19-year-old suspected rape victim has been found dead hanging from a tree in India - becoming the fourth woman from the same state to die in this way in the last few weeks.

The woman had gone missing from her house in Rajpura village in Uttar Pradesh before family members said they went to report the matter to police in nearby Thakurdwara.

Her body was then discovered outside a village in Moradabad district, around three hours from Delhi, police said. Her family say she was raped.

'We are trying to probe all angles, including enmity with someone, but it is too early to say anything,' an official of the Thakurdwara police station said.

Police are investigating at the crime scene, after a teenage girl was allegedly raped and murdered

Yesterday, an Indian woman claimed she was gang-raped by four officers at a police station in the state, which is India's most populous with more than 200 million people.

The woman said she had gone to the station overnight on Monday in the state's Hamirpur district to seek her husband's release when she was attacked.

Her claims came hours after a 44-year-old woman was found hanged from a tree near the Nepal border in the same state.

A
 police officer said they were questioning five men over the incident, 
which occurred several miles from her home in Bahraich district.

'They
 (her husband and son) have alleged that the woman, before being strung 
up from the tree, was raped and murdered by these men,' district 
superintendent Happy Guptan said.

Speaking of the bahraich allegations, the female victim told CNN-IBN: 'At 11:30pm when there was no one in the 
room the sub-inspector took me to his room and raped me inside the 
police station.'

The woman 
filed a complaint with a senior officer on Wednesday over the attack in 
Lucknow, which allegedly occurred when she refused to pay a bribe to 
secure the release of her husband.

'The
 procedure will be followed, the victim has filed a complaint and the 
guilty will be arrested soon,' Virendra Kumar Shekhar, a police official
 from Hamirpur, said.

The latest allegations follows a string of shocking sex attacks in the troubled state of Uttar Pradesh

Sub-inspector Balbir Singh said a criminal case had been lodged against four officers from the station.

The
 cases are the latest in a string of horrific rapes and murders in Uttar
 Pradesh, India's most populous state, where its chief minister Akhilesh
 Yadav is under growing political pressure over his handling of law and 
order.

Late last month, two girls, aged 12 and 14, were gang-raped and lynched in their village.

They were attacked after going into a field to relieve themselves at night because they did not have a toilet at home.

Their families refused to cut the bodies down from the tree for hours in protest, saying police had failed to take action against the attackers because the girls were from a low caste.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday urged all politicians to work together to protect women, in his first comments on the issue since the hanging of the girls sparked public outrage.

Modi warned politicians against 'politicising rape', saying they were 'playing with the dignity of women' in his first speech to parliament since sweeping to power at last month's national elections.

India brought in tougher laws last year against sexual offenders after the fatal gang-rape of a student in New Delhi in December 2012, but they have failed to stem the tide of violence against women.
