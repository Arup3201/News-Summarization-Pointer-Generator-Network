It's hardly worthy of a Terminator film, but the owner of the remote controlled vehicles in this video footage must have a lot of time on his hands. 

The oddly compelling footage, shot in Magog, Canada last month, shows a the exploits of a remote controlled car as it ventures out onto a frozen lake.

Using cameras installed in the vehicle, viewers can watch as the car becomes stuck in a patch of thin ice shortly after it embarks on its exploratory mission.

Luckily for the owner - who uses the online pseudonym 'Traxxalu' - help was at hand in for the form of a nifty remote controlled rescue truck, complete with a robotic arm and snow chains.

Using a second on-board camera, the footage shows the modified truck retracing the steps of the first vehicle, before a nail-biting rescue bid unfolds.

The robotic arms can be seen struggling for a moment as it tries to attach itself to the stricken car, but eventually manages to hook a tow-lead to the bumper, before pulling it back to safety.

'Traxxalu' later wrote online: 'I hadn't realized that the stream hadn't frozen all the way, the slash broke the ice... it was a stressful situation'. 

The well-prepared owner then sends a remote controlled rescue truck to find the stricken vehicle
