Nicklas Bendtner has admitted he is unhappy at new club Wolfsburg.

The Arsenal flop, who made over 100 appearances for the Gunners, joined the German side on a three-year deal last summer.

But he has started only four Bundesliga matches and has scored just one goal – albeit in the club’s recent win over Inter Milan in the Europa League – since November.

The Denmark international is unhappy with his lack of game time for the German side 

‘I have been training really well and done everything you’ve asked me, so am I happy with my situation? No, not at all,’ said Bendtner.

‘I’ve played a match and scored a goal, of course excellent, but the lack of playing time must change.’

Bendtner, on international duty with Denmark as they prepare for friendlies against the United States later on Wednesday, and France on Sunday, expects Wolfsburg to qualify for next season’s Champions League.

They are second in table, 10 points shy of leaders Bayern Munich with eight games remaining.

‘With a little more time I have no doubt that I’m going to score lots of goals,’ added a typically confident Bendtner, who was speaking to Danish outlet DR Forsiden.

‘We are to be in the Champions League, and so we must achieve in the next season. ‘It is about keeping a stable level, and we have the team to. If we do not sell any, and at the same time get a few reinforcements we can make it great again and follow up on this season.’
