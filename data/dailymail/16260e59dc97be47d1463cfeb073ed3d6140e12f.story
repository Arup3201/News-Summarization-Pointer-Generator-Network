It went down in football history as one of the most infamous and controversial sending off incidents the game has ever seen - and would define the careers of all those involved.

The year was 1991 and Nottingham Forest are playing West Ham in an FA Cup semi-final at Villa Park. The opening 20 minutes had been bossed by the Hammers, who played in the division below Forest and were clear underdogs.

Then came a moment that would alter the course of the match and the entire season, plus set a precedent that would change refereeing and the art of defending for ever.

As Forest's Gary Crosby broke clear, he was brought down by West Ham defender Tony Gale. To everyone's astonishment, referee Keith Hackett reached for his pocket and brandished a red card.

Gale became the first-ever footballer to be shown a straight red card for denying an attacker a goal-scoring opportunity with a professional foul.

It is a rule we're all familiar with now, but back in 1991 Hackett's decision took many by surprise and Gale is among many of a West Ham persuasion who have never forgiven him.

Forest went on to beat the 10 men 4-0 and advanced to the final against Tottenham at Wembley.

Now, 23 years later, the two men have been re-united and Gale still blames Hackett for ruining West Ham's Cup dream.

Hackett attempts to explain his decision to Gale, who took some persuasion to leave the field

Speaking in a video for you-are-the-ref.com, Gale said: 'I still probably think I wouldn't have got sent off nowadays and I still question the decision.

'I just couldn't believe it, you know. I couldn't believe it would be someone like me getting in this kind of situation.

'That was the only blot on my copybook and probably made me infamous. It might have made Keith famous but it made me infamous at the time and it was something that I thought was unforgivable.'

And Gale goes further, saying he believes Hackett wanted to make a name for himself: 'I thought it was a bit of an egotistical one at the time, in that Keith wanted to be the first one to make that decision.'

The defender, who made 300 league appearances for West Ham between 1984 and 1994, also believes his suspension led to West Ham missing out on the second division championship.

Hackett insists Gale was the victim of new rules introduced by the Football Association just a couple of days before the big match.

He said: 'On the Thursday, Ken Ridden at the FA called all referees in to discuss this particular type of incident. The managers, even the referees below Football League level at that particular time were not aware of this interpretation.

'if this incident happened a week before, Tony wouldn't have received a yellow card never mind a red.

'It ruined the game. It ruined it for the spectators and dare I say that I wasn't happy myself and the culmination was I came into the car park after the game really unhappy, very unhappy in this particular decision. 

'I threw my bag into the car and there was an FA guy there... he tapped me on the shoulder and just said, "Well done. If you hadn't have sent him off you'd have been suspended."

'I always remembered that because I then had some choice words for him. I [later] had the death threats, which were taken quite seriously.'

Hackett added that he is still not in favour of the rule despite it being a well-established part of the game now.

'I still think that denial of an obvious goalscoring opportunity is a bad law... in the case of a defence inside the penalty area, you know, that denial of the goal is replaced by the penalty kick.

'So it's an offence where the punishment is a triple jeopardy - it's dismissal, it's a penalty and it's a suspension and that can't be right.'

Brian Clough's Forest went on to lose 2-1 to Terry Venables' Spurs in the final but the controversy of Gale's red rumbles on to this day.
