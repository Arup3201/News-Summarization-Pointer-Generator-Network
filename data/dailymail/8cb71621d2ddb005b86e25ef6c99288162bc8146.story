More than 20,000 people from all over the United States have asked that the Catholic Diocese in Helena, Montana reverse their decision to fire an unmarried and pregnant Middle school teacher.

The social justice group Faithful America and the teacher's friends, Susan Hawthorne and Margaret Rankin, delivered a petition with 22,000 signatures to Bishop George Leo Thomas of The Roman Catholic Diocese of Helena on Thursday.

The petition calls the decision to fire the pregnant teacher at Butte Central Elementary-Junior High School, Shaela Evenson, 'hypocritical.'

Shaela Evenson was fired for being pregnant but has over 20,000 supporters in her fight to get her job back

Evenson was a literature and physical education teacher at the school for eight years. USA Today reports that when the diocese received an anonymous letter saying the teacher was pregnant, administrators decided to fire her not based on her merit but because her pregnancy violated their conservative Catholic belief system.

'Firing an unmarried teacher for becoming pregnant is cruel and hypocritical,' said the petition.'Give Shaela Evenson her job back, and start taking Pope Francis' words about love and healing more seriously,' it continued.

Faithful America's deputy director, Aaron Villes said that the organization did not inform Evenson that they were taking action in her favor before doing so.

'This petition came from the staff of Faithful America,'Viles said Thursday. 'We saw her story and were inspired to take action.'

The organization's petition holds 22,000 signatures, 7,000 more signature's than the organization's original goal of 15,000.

One of Evenson's friends, Jen Hensly, started a gofundme page to raise money for her. Evenson is currently jobless and in her eight month of pregnancy.

'Besides being an outstanding educator and an inspiration to her young students, Shaela is in a long-term, committed relationship, said Hensly.

'This pregnancy is hard fought and very much wanted,’ she added.

Moveon.org also started a petition for Evenson that boasts 900 signatures.

Unfortunately, Evenson's friend Rankin doesn't believe that the petitions will have any influence on the church.

'The only way that change could be made is if (Pope) Francis himself came and asked for that change to be made, and I doubt that would happen,' Rankin told USA today.

Supporters delivered the petition to Bishop Thomas' office at the chancery near the Cathedral at St.Helena but he wasn't there to collect the letter of support.

Evenson was a literature and physical education teacher at the school for eight years prior to her termination

Diocese spokesman Dan Bartleson received the letter instead and said that the bishop would take their opinion into consideration. Bartleson discussed the matter with the bishop before the petition was delivered and it didn't seem like he was willing to change his opinion.

'At this time it's unlikely, right now, that he would reverse the decision that was made in Butte,' said Bartleson.

Thomas told reporters that his staunch decision to terminate Evenson was partly based on Pope Francis' advice to Catholic Educators in January that asked them to, 'give uncompromising and unambiguous witness to church teaching and defend themselves from all efforts to dilute their Catholic identity.'

'I am deeply saddened by these recent events, and caught between the values of upholding the Catholic identity of our schools while desiring to provide pastoral outreach and understanding to the teacher,' said Thomas.

'At the end of the day, there are no easy answers or facile solutions,' he continued.

Evenson's dismissal sparked a backlash in the community, where some Catholics pointed out that even Pope Francis has been signalling lately that unwed mothers should not be shunned by society

Evenson herself is not catholic and she and her lawyer Brian Butler are attempting to push employers and religious organizations to follow state and federal anti-discrimination laws. 

Brian Butler filed a discrimination charge with the Federal Equal Opportunity Commission alleging the school violated Evenson’s rights under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.

Evenson's dismissal sparked a backlash in the community, where some Catholics pointed out that even Pope Francis has been signalling lately that unwed mothers should not be shunned by society.

Last month, the pontiff baptized a child born out of wedlock inside the Sistine Chapel, and in September, he offered an unmarried woman who had chosen not to have an abortion to personally baptize the baby.

Butler also cited a case in June in which a federal jury found that the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Cincinnati discriminated against a Catholic school teacher, Christa Dias, when they fired her for becoming pregnant through artificial insemination.

'These cases are nearly identical. She (Dias) was not Catholic, and she didn't teach any religion,' Butler said.

'She decided to have a child, and when the school found out she was pregnant, she was terminated.'

Butler represented Dias in that case and she won $170,000.
