Occupy Wall Street protesters are striking back after a weekend of allegedly violent arrests, including one woman reportedly suffering a seizure after police knocked her to the ground in Zuccotti Park.

During the movement's six month anniversary protest on Saturday night, as many as 700 supporters swarmed the area and 73 arrests were made, sparking a renewed call for action.

Protestors scrambled to organise a press conference on Tuesday morning to demand the resignation of New York Police Commissioner Ray Kelly, asking activists to meet at Foley Park.

The movement has also urged supporters 
across the nation to skip work and school on May 1 in defiance, while 
worker justice groups in New York planned to march through the city on 
the same day.

They're back: Occupy Wall Street protesters gather at Union Square on 
Monday after dozens of activists were arrested at a demonstration 
marking the six month anniversary of the movement this weekend

It comes amid signs that the movement is
 ready to swing back into action in the warmer months after being driven
 from the streets by bitter winter weather. Police are now standing guard at the park.

Video footage from Saturday's protest shows Cecily McMillan, leader of a Northeast Democratic Socialists group, apparently suffering a seizure after being handcuffed by police and left in the street.

Former cheerleader Miss McMillan, who studies and works as a nanny in New York, was filmed shaking violently as protestors, who had been penned in by police, screamed for authorities to help.

Police were seen carrying Miss 
McMillan, 23, after the seizure. Activists yelled: 'That's not what you 
do to someone with a seizure!' and 'Do not touch her head or neck!'

'Victim': Cecily McMillan, a student and nanny, reportedly suffered a seizure after she was allegedly violently arrested by police during an Occupy Wall Street protest in Zuccotti Park on Saturday night

The
 YouTube clip was filmed by Julia Reinhart, 40, a music manager who has 
supported Occupy Wall Street since September and regularly videos and 
photographs protests.

Prior to this Ms Reinhart, who knows 
Miss McMillan from the camp, said she witnessed a police officer hitting
 a young woman with a baton who appeared to be her.

She told MailOnline: 'Cops were not in a hurry to help her and she was handcuffed. People in the crowd who have EMT licenses asked if they could go to her but police refused to let them through.'

After appearing to have a seizure, Miss McMillan pulled herself to her knees and struggled for breath, dry heaving for several minutes.

She later appeared to faint before 
being given oxygen. An ambulance did not arrive until around 15 minutes 
after she first collapsed, witnesses claimed.

Rusty Braxton

An Occupy Wall Street sympathiser who tweeted about killing police has complained he has received death threats.

Rusty Braxton, a 23-year-old restaurant manager from Florida, tweeted 'we wont make a difference if we dont kill a cop or 2' while watching footage of the protest at Zuccotti Park on Saturday.

The NYPD said it has been in contact with officers in Florida, but it is not clear if they consider it a real threat.

Braxton told the New York Daily News: 'I'm not really worried. You can't legally kick in someone's door for one comment on the Internet.'

He added: 'I'm not a cop hater... [But] when I see the police throw people down and push people, I get upset.'

The NYPD had sought a subpoena to find out who had written the tweet. Braxton has since been forced to remove his Twitter and Facebook accounts, he told the Daily News.

An unidentified protester added: 
'[Police] were just standing. They dragged her from the ground on the 
street over to the curb and let her lay on the curb.

'They
 did not support her neck or spine the way you're supposed to do when 
someone is seizing to prevent them from choking on their tongue or their
 own blood. They did none of those things.'

In another video posted on 
YouTube, a girl wearing similar clothes to Miss McMillan appeared to elbow a policeman in the head before being grabbed by officers.

Voices over the grainy footage can he heard saying: 'There's Cecily', but her identity remains unclear.

Police confirmed a 23-year-old from Wisconsin - McMillan's home state - had been arrested for elbowing an officer.

McMillan, the Northeast regional organiser for the
 youth section of the Democratic Socialists of America, has had run-ins
 with authorities at the protest before, according to Rolling Stone.

A profile of the activist, written 
last November, noted that she was arrested violently in the past after 
attempting to storm Wall Street three times in a 'direct action'.

According to the magazine: 'A cop... blasted her with 
pepper spray, knocked her down, stepped on her head and snarled at her, 
"Shut up. You get what you deserve, b****".'

McMillan has been involved in the 
movement since August, and admitted to the magazine that her views - and
 belief there needs to be leadership - were at odds with many of
 the protestors.

'I believe in a constrained view of 
revolution,' she told Rolling Stone, adding that she wants to put 
pressure on mainstream politicians.

Attending the city's prestigious New School and 
working as a nanny, Miss McMillan was unable to sleep in the park - but claimed to be devoted to the cause.

She added that her grandfather Harlon Joye drafted the constitution for the Students for a Democratic Society, one of the key organisations of 1960s revolt.

Following her arrest, there were reports that McMillan had been taken to an emergency room with possible cracked ribs.

This afternoon, the OWS Twitter feed said she had been released without bail.

The tensions came on the six-month anniversary of the OWS movement on March 17. Police swooped on Zuccotti Park after protesters 
attempted to put up tents.

Ms Reinhart, who is originally from Switzerland but lives in New York, also told MailOnline: 'Around 300 people were in Zuccotti Park at 11.30pm. It was peaceful, people were talking and dancing.

'About 200 police arrived and announced with a bull horn that the park was now closed for maintenance and that people would be arrested for trespassing.

'Many people sat down, locked arms and began chanting. Police grabbed them by the hair, beat them with sticks and chased those who tried to flee.'

Following
 the weekend's events, OWS activists called for supporters to skip work and school on 
May 1 in protest and not spend any money.

No end: Occupy Wall Street activists staged a protest to mark six months of the movement

Keeping guard: Around 73 people were arrested over the weekend in New York

Ongoing: Protesters affiliated with Occupy Wall Street gather in Union Square on Monday

In New York, a coalition of unions 
and worker justice groups planned to march through the city on the same day.

Demonstrators and members of New York's City Council held a news conference on Monday to complain about police tactics.

Events have also been organised around Union Square in Manhattan tomorrow and later in the week. There were fears that the movement was reforming as the warmer weather returns.

Mayor Michael Bloomberg said in a statement that police were respectful of people's rights during the arrests.

The New York Police Department were yet to respond to a request for comment on the events of March 17 to MailOnline.
