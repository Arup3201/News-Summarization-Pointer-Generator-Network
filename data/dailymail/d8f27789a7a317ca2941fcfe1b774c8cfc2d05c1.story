Tony Pulis has begun major changes to his backroom staff at West Brom with coaches Rob Kelly, Keith Downing and Dean Kiely all leaving the club.

The trio have left with immediate effect and Pulis is now looking to finalise the rest of backroom staff at The Hawthorns.

Kelly took caretaker charge after Alan Irvine was sacked last week, overseeing the 1-1 draw at West Ham before Pulis assumed control.

Director of football administration Richard Garlick told the club's official site: 'The club would like to place on record its deep appreciation for the contribution of Keith, Rob and Dean within the coaching structure.

'Keith and Dean have been here a number of years and took over first-team control in a caretaker capacity during a difficult period last season. They played a key role in stabilising the team.

'Rob joined at the start of the season and became a valued member of the coaching set-up.

'Changes in personnel are part of football life and it is obviously sad to say farewell to three popular and respected members of staff.

'We wish to thank them for their efforts and wish them all the very best in their future endeavours.'

West Bromwich Albion today announce the departures of senior coaches Rob Kelly, Keith Downing and Dean Kiely.

The trio have left the club with immediate effect as Tony Pulis prepares to finalise the appointment of a new backroom staff.

Director of football administration Richard Garlick said: 'The Club would like to place on record its deep appreciation for the contribution of Keith, Rob and Dean within the coaching structure.

'Keith and Dean have been here a number of years and took over first-team control in a caretaker capacity during a difficult period last season. They played a key role in stabilising the team.

'Rob joined at the start of the season and became a valued member of the coaching set-up.

'Changes in personnel are part of football life and it is obviously sad to say farewell to three popular and respected members of staff.

'We wish to thank them for their efforts and wish them all the very best in their future endeavours.'

Downing became first-team coach under Roy Hodgson, in March 2011, before being elevated to Assistant Head Coach in December 2011 following the departure of Michael Appleton to become Portsmouth manager.

Following Steve Clarke's departure in December 2013, Downing took the reins at The Hawthorns in caretaker capacity - his side winning one and drawing three of his five Barclays Premier League games in charge.

Albion recruited Downing as Academy Under-18s coach in July 2009. He also became responsible for running the Baggies' Barclays Premier Reserve League team at the start of the 2010/11 campaign.

Kelly joined Albion as Alan Irvine's Joint-Assistant Head Coach alongside Downing in June.

Kiely became Albion Goalkeeper Coach in March 2010.

The former Republic of Ireland man initially joined the club as a player in January 2007, helping the club to the Championship play-off final later that year.

The following season he scooped the Championship's 2007/08 Puma Golden Glove thanks to his 18 clean sheets in all competitions after helping Albion clinch the title and reach and FA Cup semi-final.

He made 88 appearances for Albion as a player.
