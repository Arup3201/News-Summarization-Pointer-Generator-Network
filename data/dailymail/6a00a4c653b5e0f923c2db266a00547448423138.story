Lily Marie Hartwell, 14, is facing arson and attempted murder charges after police say she admitted to setting fire to her mom's home

A 14-year-old girl has been accused of setting fire to her home in Port Richie, Florida, in the early hours of Thursday morning while her mom and brother were sleeping inside.

The teenager, Lily Marie Hartwell, had argued with her mom on Wednesday evening over household chores and had been reading an ebook called Soul Eater about killing people, the Pasco County Sheriff’s Office reported.

The teen’s mother and 9-year-old brother were able to escape the fire after being awoken by the smoke alarm at about 1.45 am.

The mother realized the girl was not with them and went back inside to find her, but was driven back by the heat, said Sheriff Chris Nocco.

Firefighters also went into the burning house three times to search for the girl before concluding she was not there, investigators said.

Later, the girl sent her mother a text saying: 'Mom, I’m so sorry. I don’t know why I did it. Did any of [you] get hurt?' according to the police report.

The girl has been taken into custody and charged with one count of arson and two counts of attempted murder, reports SuncoastNews.

Investigators say she has admitted to starting the fire by soaking a towel and bedsheet with bleach and rum then setting them alight in the garage.

The girl told investigators that she then walked to a nearby park bathroom and went to sleep, after packing a bag with clothes, bottled water, cookies, knives, lighters and flashlights.

The Slender Man is a prevalent internet myth that has been a viral sensation since it emerged online in 2009 and police have revealed that the girl had written about him in her journal marked 'Keep Out'

Before lighting the blaze, Nocco said, she changed out of her loose-fitting pajamas realizing they could have caught fire.

'She planned this whole thing out,' he said.

In the journal marked 'Keep Out,' one written entry stated 'if this keeps up there will be no safety in this house.'

The girl  had also written about her interest in Slender Man, a fictional character who is the subject of numerous online stories that involve murder, and other online sites with similar dark themes. The teen also told detectives she visited websites related to the character.

The Slender Man stories reportedly influenced a case in Wisconsin in which two 12-year-old girls were accused of stabbing a classmate, and the Port Richey teen mentioned that case in her journal, Nocco said.

'There's a clear direction,' Nocco said. 'She's involved in reading these things.' 

It took 17 firefighters from three stations to knock down the flames.

Neighbors expressed shock, saying the girl was a typical teen who had never done anything to raise alarm, and the family members were good neighbors.

'It’s a tragedy,' Sandy Gilbert, who lives across the street, told Suncoast News. 'I hate to see something like this happen to such a nice family.'
