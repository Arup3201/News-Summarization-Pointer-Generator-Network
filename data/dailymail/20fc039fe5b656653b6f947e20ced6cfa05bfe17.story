Seven people have been charged with first-degree murder in connection with the fatal shooting of a 24-year-old man.

Justin Barnard, 24, was killed at his grandmother's home in Norman, Oklahoma on March 28. His grandmother was also beaten and robbed by his killers who stormed the property.

Mr Barnard's girlfriend Dianna Paige St Clair, 27, was arraigned on Monday in Cleveland County District Court along with Rusty Wooten, 31; Michael Tubby, 21; Jason Harris, 28; Gary Harris, 29; Montie Ray Jones, 45, and Isaiah Walker, 23.

St Clair allegedly arranged the hit on her boyfriend. One of the accused Gary Harris told police that he overheard St Clair on the phone to Wooten last month where she said she wanted Barnard 'beat down' because he assaulted her.

St Clair claimed that Barnard attacked her on March 26 during a dispute between the couple in Oklahoma City.

It is then believed that Wooten passed on St Clair's message to a group of people who were at his home including Gary Harris, Walker, Tubby, Jones, Jason Harris and an unknown male.

St Clair was put on speaker phone so that all the men could hear what she wanted. The 27-year-old is alleged to have provided the address of Barnard's grandmother, where he was staying.

The relationship between St Clair, Wooten and the five other men remains unclear.

According to affidavits, Barnard received a phone call from 'Rusty' saying that he was on his way to kill him on March 28.

Minutes later, two cars full of people in ski masks pulled on to the front lawn of the home.

Mr Barnard's grandmother tried to stop six individuals breaking down her front door but she was struck in the head and knocked to the ground, according to an affidavit.

She was threatened with a gun and one suspect took her wallet containing around $430.

Justin Barnard then came into the living room, struggled with the suspect and was shot. He was later pronounced dead at a Norman hospital.

The victim's father Marvin told News 9 that he received a chilling voice mail from his son in the minutes before he died where Justin claimed that men were coming to kill him.

In addition to first-degree murder, the six men face first-degree burglary and robbery with a dangerous weapon charges.

Jones and Walker are being held without bail. Bail for Jason Harris, St Clair, Tubby and Wooten was set at $2 million, and bail for Gary Harris was set at $1 million.

A preliminary hearing is set for the seven individuals on April 15, according to KOKH.

Norman Captain Tom Easley told MailOnline today that no further details were available at this time because the investigation is ongoing.

The victim reportedly made a terrified phone call to his father saying that men were coming to kill him at his grandmother's home (pictured) last month
