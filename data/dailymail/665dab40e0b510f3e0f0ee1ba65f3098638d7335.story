Children around the world have been recreating the nativity in countless school plays during the build up to Christmas.

But they may have to get rid of the cardboard donkeys and straw-covered floor next year if a theologian's claims are true.

Minister and academic Reverend Ian Paul insists Jesus Christ was not born in a stable, but in a busy room in a  family home.

The image of Jesus being born in a stable has adorned thousands of  stained-glass windows, paintings and Christmas cards, but a Christian scholar has suggested the idea may be a myth born of poor translation

He says the misconception comes from poor translation of the original Greek text, which made it sound as if the birth took place amid farm animals in a barn or stable.

The Greek word 'kataluma', he says, was wrongly translated as 'inn'. In fact, he claims, the word means 'private room' or 'lodging'.

He says the misunderstanding wrongly suggested Mary and Joseph were turned away from a hostel-like building, instead of, as he claims, being put up in communal area in the family home because there was no room just for them.

In Rev Paul's interpretation of the Bible story, Joseph, returning to Bethlehem, would have been received by distant relatives.

Because his relations' guest room was already full, the family would have stayed in the main family room, where Jesus was born, Rev Paul says. 

The traditional view of Jesus's birth surrounded by donkeys and cows has been recreated countless times

But Rev Ian Paul says the idea came from a mistranslation which made it sound like Mary and Joseph were turned away from an inn, so had to settle for a stable

The Reverend wrote on his blog: 'What does it mean for the kataluma to have "no space"?

'It means that many, like Joseph and Mary, have travelled to Bethlehem, and the family guest room is already full, probably with other relatives who arrived earlier.

'So Joseph and Mary must stay with the family itself, in the main room of the house, and there Mary gives birth.' 

Research by YouGov released today found that 65 per cent of the British public believe Jesus lived.

But a majority of people, 55 per cent, think that Jesus was not born to a virgin mother, compared to 24 per cent who think he was.

The most widely believed detail of the Christmas story is that the new born baby Jesus was laid in a manger, which 47 per cent of people believe to be true compared to just 29 per cent who do not.

The survey revealed just 37 per cent believe that the three wise men were guided by a star and brought gifts and 28 per cent believe an angel of the Lord appeared to the shepherds.

He says the layout of homes at the time meant that animals were fed in manger-type arrangements at the edge of the family room. 

He added: 'The most natural place to lay the baby is in the straw-filled depressions at the lower end of the house where the animals are fed.

'The idea that they were in a stable, away from others, alone and outcast, is grammatically and culturally implausible. In fact, it is hard to be alone at all in such contexts.'

Rev Paul, an Honorary Assistant Professor at the University of Nottingham, says the mistranslation is important, not just for children's plays, but because it can change the way the story is interpreted.

He added: 'In the Christmas story, Jesus is not sad and lonely, some distance away in the stable, needing our sympathy.

'He is in the midst of the family, and all the visiting relations, right in the thick of it and demanding our attention. This should fundamentally change our approach to enacting and preaching on the nativity.'

Father-of-four Rev Paul initially trained in maths at Oxford University and worked in business for Mars chocolate before training for ordination. 

Modern-day Bethlehem. Rev Paul says it is inconceivable that Palestinians in the time of Jesus would have allowed the family to stay in an out-building

Luke 2: 4-8 (New International Version)

4 So Joseph also went up from the town of Nazareth in Galilee to Judea, to Bethlehem the town of David, because he belonged to the house and line of David.

5 He went there to register with Mary, who was pledged to be married to him and was expecting a child.

6 While they were there, the time came for the baby to be born,

7 and she gave birth to her firstborn, a son. She wrapped him in cloths and placed him in a manger, because there was no guest room available for them.
