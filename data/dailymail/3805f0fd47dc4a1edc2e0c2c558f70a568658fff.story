Thousands of men and women who regularly drink just three glasses of wine a day could be given a £3 pill to help them cut back under NHS guidelines.

They urge GPs to prescribe the drug nalmefene to up to 600,000 adults in England deemed to be mild alcoholics.

Many may not even consider themselves heavy drinkers and simply look forward to a few glasses of wine at evenings and weekends.

GPs are being urged to prescribe the £3 pill namalfene to 600,000 'mild alcoholics' who drink three glasses of wine or more a day, under new guidelines from health watchdog NICE

But guidelines from the watchdog NICE says that women who drink more than two glasses of wine a day and men over four pints could be eligible.

The NHS’s safe drinking limits are 2 to 3 units a day for women and 3 to 4 for men - there are just over two units in a medium glass of wine or pint of beer.

Women who drink five units a day and men seven and a half - and who struggle to get by without it - could be offered the pill.

Over the last decade deaths from liver disease have soared by a fifth and there were 4,425 in 2012 – mostly in the middle age.

Alcohol is also known to increase the risk of many cancers and it also raises the blood pressure which can cause stroke and heart disease.

The pill works by reducing the amount of the chemical dopamine released by the brain, which is responsible for the reward or ‘buzz’ feeling.

It enables adults to enjoy one or two drinks and then stop without needing more.

For this reason it would mean they wouldn’t have to go tee-total but could continue drinking socially at far lower levels.

It would enable adults to have one drink socially but then stop without needing more and more.

The guidance - which is provisional – tells doctors to prescribe the pill for a maximum of six months alongside counselling sessions such as with Alcoholics Anonymous.

If all were to take the pill – on average every other day when they needed – for six months it would cost more than £150 million.

By comparison, the NHS spends an estimated £3.5 billion annually treating patients for alcohol misuse.

Andrew Langford, Chief Executive of the British Liver Trust, said: ‘The range of people who put themselves at risk through their drinking is quite wide.

‘Some have not yet experienced social problems and are functioning well until they develop an alcohol-related physical illness such as high blood pressure, cancer or liver disease; while others lose their social supports and then tend to fit the stereotype of the ‘alcoholic’.

‘Reducing alcohol consumption can prevent these social and physical damages developing.’

Professor Jonathan Chick, Consultant Psychiatrist at Queen Margaret University Hospital Edinburgh, who specialises in alcohol dependence said: ‘Although for many people dependent on alcohol, abstinence is the preferred and optimal goal, nalmefene represents an alternative step, helping people to cut down drinking to less harmful levels when they are not ready and have no medical need to give up alcohol altogether.’

GPs are told to identify heavy drinker patients through a series of questions during routine appointments or when they first register with a practice.

The NHS’s safe drinking limits are 2 to 3 units a day for women and 3 to 4 for men - there are just over two units in a medium glass of wine or pint of beer

These include how many units to you drink in a typical week and how often do you go over the recommended safe units of 2 to 3 for a woman 3 to 4 for a man.

Doctors are also encouraged to look out for warning signs of heavy drinking such as a high blood pressure, insomnia, feeling low and a ruddy complexion.

Trials involving 700 patients have found that taking the pill for six months reduced the average alcohol consumption from nine units to three units a day.

The number of days patients drank heavily more than halved from 18 days a month to just eight.

Professor Carole Longson, NICE Health Technology Evaluation Centre Director, said: ‘Alcohol dependence is a serious issue for many people.

‘Those who could be prescribed nalmefene have already taken the first big steps by visiting their doctor, engaging with support services and taking part in therapy programmes.

‘We are pleased to be able to recommend the use of namelfene to support people further in their efforts to fight alcohol dependence

‘When used alongside psychosocial support nalmefene is clinically and cost effective for the NHS compared with psychosocial support alone.’

NICE recommends that the drug is prescribed for a maximum of six months after which it is hoped patients would have cut back on their drinking with the additional help of counselling.

It can cause unpleasant side effects such as sickness, dizziness, headaches and sleeping problems.

Jackie Ballard, Chief Executive of Alcohol Concern, said: ‘It is important that there is a variety of treatments available to support people who want help with their alcohol dependency.

‘The introduction of nalmefene will be a useful addition to the clinician’s toolbox, when used in conjunction with other treatment methods to tackle the harmful consequences of alcohol misuse.’
