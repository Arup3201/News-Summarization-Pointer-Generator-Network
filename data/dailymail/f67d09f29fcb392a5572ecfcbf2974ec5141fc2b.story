Rangers great Stuart McCall has given his backing to Dave King and the Three Bears in their bid to oust Mike Ashley’s regime from the Ibrox boardroom, insisting that only investors with business brains and the best interests of the club at heart will be able to win over fans currently in open revolt.

The consortium led by George Letham, Douglas Park and George Taylor will back King’s call for a General Meeting — and vote with him to remove the current board — if their alternative to Ashley’s £10 million mortgage on the stadium and training ground is rejected.

Although negotiations between Letham and Rangers chief executive Derek Llambias are still ongoing, there is general scepticism over the club’s willingness to deal with anyone other than Newcastle United owner Ashley, described by former Magpies chairman Freddy Shepherd on Saturday as ‘the Bank of Rangers.’

Shepherd suggested that Ashley could yet sell his controlling stake in the English Premier League club in order to mount a genuine takeover of the club — although he believes that the Sports Direct tycoon ‘enjoys the idea of controlling two clubs’.

For Nine-in-a-Row legend McCall, the chance to get rid of Ashley and replace him with genuine Rangers fans is too good to be missed.

‘What Rangers need is someone at the club who doesn’t just have business sense, but is actually doing it for the love of the club — because they’ve got ties to the club,’ said the former Scotland midfielder.

‘I don’t know any of these gentlemen (Park, Letham, Taylor) but, if you believe what you read, they have Rangers at heart. And I know Richard Gough has spoken about Dave King.

‘Now I’m not saying that, just because you have Rangers at heart, you are going to be successful and the club is going to make money. But you do know that, whatever they are doing, they are doing it for the right reasons.

‘They are not in there just for, we can do this, we can do that, we can earn this and we can get out. What you want is people that the club matters to and will do their best for the club, not for themselves as individuals.

‘If it is The Three Bears, if it is Dave King, if it anyone else, you would rather have people who bother about the club and it’s just about money making.

‘What is alarming is when they (the board) say they need so much. No-one really knows Mr Ashley’s plans or ideas because you never get a one-to-one interview, he is a private person.

‘But as a supporter, you want to know what is going on, even a little bit. It’s all of this cloak-and-dagger stuff.

‘How is it going to be resolved? Do they need the money here and now to keep the lights on?

‘Mr Ashley has got what, eight-and-a-half or nine per cent of the club? Yet he seems to be the one making all the decisions — appointing a chief exec and a finance director etc.

‘Obviously I’ve got a lot of friends and family who are Rangers supporters — and they can’t understand how this can be the case.

‘The catalyst for everything now has been the fact that Ibrox was going to be put up as security against loans. Supporters see other people wanting to offer money and ask why Ashley is the best option.’

Shepherd told BBC Five Live’s Sportsweek programme on Sunday that Ashley was now calling all the shots at Ibrox, despite the SFA limiting his shareholding and charging him with a breach of dual influence rules, the former Newcastle chairman saying: ‘He’s now become the Bank of Rangers. He’s a very clever guy.

‘What he’s done is get ten per cent of Rangers, he can’t buy any more — so he’s lent them money and become the bank. And banks control clubs. It’s as simple as that.’

Asked if he thought Ashley was ready to sell Newcastle and buy into Rangers properly, Shepherd said: ‘Possibly. But I think he likes the idea of controlling two clubs, that’s where it’s coming from.

‘He’s put money into Rangers when they were desperate for money.’
