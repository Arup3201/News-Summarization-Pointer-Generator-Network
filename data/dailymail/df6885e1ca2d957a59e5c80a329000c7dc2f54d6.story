Virginia Wade said it was a ‘total shock’ when Andy Murray hired Amelie Mauresmo as his coach and thought the appointment was a joke.

On the eve of Wimbledon fortnight, where Murray will defend his title, the last British female to win the singles also questioned the mental toughness of Mauresmo, the Frenchwoman who was champion in 2006.

All smiles: Andy Murray and Amelie Mauresmo share a joke in training

Shock: Virginia Wade was stunned when she heard the announcement 

‘Mauresmo was a total shock,’ said Wade. ‘I thought they were all fooling around … She was a great player, she’s a great person. [But] I think she was a little fragile mentally. She’s laid back, she’s a very nice, mature person. But I can’t work it out at all. You like to try to get behind people’s thinking but I can’t really with this one.’

Wade said perhaps the only explanation was Murray wanted someone to say ‘well done’ to him. ‘As a player you need somebody to endorse you sometimes,’ she said.
