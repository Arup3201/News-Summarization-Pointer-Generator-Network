On trial: Award-winning cameraman Huw Talfryn Walters outside Cardiff Crown Court where he is accused of forging his wife's signature

An award-winning BBC cameraman forged his wife's signature to pay off nearly £60,000 in debts, to save himself from bankruptcy, before leaving her, a court heard.

Bafta-winner Huw Talfryn Walters, 50, allegedly spent the money on buying expensive camera and photographic equipment.

But the court heard the freelance cameraman kept his wife in Helen Bowen in the dark about his spiralling money problems.

A jury was told he forged Helen’s signature to take £59,000 from the joint mortgage on their marital home in Cardiff.

He then ended their 14-year marriage after telling his wife he needed to put their house up for sale.

Walters allegedly told Miss Bowen: 'I’m divorcing you because if I don’t I’m going to go bankrupt.'

Cardiff Crown Court heard Walters forged his wife's signature three times to draw down cash from their take £59,000 from their joint mortgage.

Prosecutor John Davies said: 'Miss Bowen made a career change around 2005 and after that left the mortgage and bills to her husband who she trusted.

'They separated in December 2011 and not long after that she became aware the mortgage had increased without her agreement.

'She contacted the bank to obtain copies of the three withdrawals which increased the size of the mortgage by £59,000.

'She realised the signatures on them didn’t belong to her - they were written by her husband without her knowledge while they still lived together.'

Freelance cameraman Walters has worked on programmes including the BBC Proms, Doctor Who and Channel 4’s history show Time Team.

He has won two Welsh Baftas for his cinematography and camera work in recent years.

Mr Davies told the jury: 'This was a man who needed the money and was prepared to use whatever means he could to meet his outgoings.

'These were deliberate and dishonest acts and now he must pay for it.'

The court heard a forensic handwriting expert proved Miss Bowen’s signature had been written by her husband.

Holding back tears Miss Bowen said: 'The breakdown of our marriage was completely and utterly sudden.

'The week before he left, my husband had asked me where I would like to spend my 50th birthday and said he felt I needed a new car. Then he just ran out of the door.

'We met a couple of days later in 
Starbucks and he said he was going to divorce me for unreasonable 
behaviour because if he didn’t he was going to go bankrupt.

'He said he couldn’t wait the two years for a separation by consent and needed the money from the house to pay off his debts.

'I guessed something was wrong a few days after he left because the credit card companies started ringing.'

She said she didn’t discover he had forged her signature until a few months after their separation - when she was contacted by her mortgage provider.

She said: 'I trusted my husband - I was married to him and I loved him very much.

'I didn’t think he would have done anything to me like this.

'I am incredibly cautious with money and I will save for something I want and never pay for anything if I haven’t got the money.

'I cannot say the same of my husband.'

Walters, of Maesteg, South Wales, denies three charges of fraud.

The trial continues.
