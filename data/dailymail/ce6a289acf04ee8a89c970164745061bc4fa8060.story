A grandfather died in agony and begging for pain relief after doctors failed to spot he had seven broken ribs, his family say.

Peter Bellinger, 77, slipped on ice outside his home and was admitted to Blackpool Victoria Hospital in  Lancashire, where he was left undiagnosed and untreated for days, it is claimed.

By the time staff realised his ribs were fractured, he had contracted pneumonia, which led to blood poisoning.

The hospital trust in charge of Mr Bellinger's care has admitted that mistakes were made and have apologised to his family

Pneumonia can develop after rib fractures if patients are not breathing deeply enough.

NHS bosses at Blackpool Teaching Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, who are charged with running the hospital, admitted that failings by medical staff led to Mr Bellinger's death in 2010.

The hospital has admitted the care Mr Bellinger received 'fell below the standard expected' but insisted improvements in the care of pneumonia and sepsis have been made, and staff levels are being improved.

But Mr Bellinger's family say they fear conditions have not improved enough.

In April this year, the Care Quality Commission (CQC), which is in charge of inspecting hospitals, released a damning report about care at the hospital.

After an inspection, five of the eight departments at the hospital were rated as either 'inadequate' or 'requiring improvement'.

Although it was found that the trust had undertaken work on improving clinical pathways, the CQC said the trust's  reporting of accidents and near misses was not good, the quality of patient notes were poor and information on patients was difficult to access.

The trust is also currently undergoing an investigation into why it has a higher rate of significant bleeding after childbirth.

Mr Bellinger's daughter Michelle Lunn, 49, from Thornton, Lancashire, said failures at the hospital meant her father died in agony.

She said: 'I only saw my father cry twice in his life.

'Once was when his own mother died, the other was when he cried in pain, begging for pain medication at the hospital.

'My mother has never been the same. They were joined at the hip.

Mr Bellinger's daughter, Michelle Lunn, 49, said her father went from a man who loved going on holiday with his wife (left) to dying in agony, 'crying for pain medication'

'When he died she lost her right hand. He was a fit and healthy man and was well known in Blackpool.

'He used to love travelling and going away on holiday with mum. He shouldn't have died after breaking a few ribs.' 

She said the family want to see improvements so others don't die in this way.

She said: 'If he had been looked after properly, he would still be with us, looking after us all and enjoying time with his family and friends.

'No apology can ever make up for what has happened. We just want to make sure it doesn't happen again and no-one has to go through what we have.

'We will never stop missing him.' 

A report from the Care Quality Commission from April found that five of the eight departments at the hospital  were rated as either 'inadequate' or 'requiring improvement'

A spokesperson for Blackpool Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust said: 'The Trust has extended its deepest apologies and condolences to the family of Mr Bellinger and acknowledged failings in this case.

'We fully accept that the delivery of care received by Mr Bellinger, and his family, fell below the standard expected and a full admission has been made in that respect.

'We would like to assure both Mr Bellinger's family, and our residents, that we have made significant improvements since 2010 which were acknowledged and commended by the CQC inspection of the Trust in January 2014.

'This included advances in new care pathways for both pneumonia and sepsis and improvements in staffing levels and reductions in mortality rates.

'Patient safety is the Trust's continuing number one priority and we are dedicated to learning lessons at all times to make sure we provide the highest possible standards of safety and care.'
