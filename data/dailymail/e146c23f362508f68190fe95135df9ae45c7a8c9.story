An animal rights group has released harrowing footage of a circus elephant going on the rampage and being gunned down on the street 20 years after the incident to draw attention to the cruelty it says they suffering being trained to entertain.

The People For The Ethical Treatment Of Animals organisation (Peta), posted footage on social media of Tyke the elephant running amok at the Neal S. Blaisdell Center in Honolulu, Hawaii, in 1994.

Just before a performance she went berserk, killing one of her trainers and then charging out into the street, sending passers-by running for their lives.

Shocking: Tyke the elephant ran amok just before a performance at the Neal S. Blaisdell Center in Honolulu in Hawaii in 1994

Out of control: The terrified animal left one dead and 13 injured

Police quickly arrived on the scene and shot the elephant dead. It took almost 100 rounds to bring her down and she eventually collapsed dead against the side of a car.

Along with the death of the trainer, the rampage left 13 people injured.

Peta is using the footage to persuade circuses to abandon their use of animals, claiming that the training they endure ‘drives them to the brink’.

‘It’s no surprise that these animals lash out,’ it said. ‘Circuses use violence, intimidation, and extreme confinement to force elephants to perform inane tricks. These cruel training techniques are used to break elephants' spirits when they're only babies, and they mark the beginning of a life in which everything that is natural and important to these sensitive, intelligent animals is taken away from them.’

Stopped in her tracks: Tyke cannot carry on after facing a hail of bullets

Gunned down: Tyke was shot almost 100 times after running out into the street

Taking aim: A man fires his rifle at Tyke

Tragedy: Peta claims that training animals to perform is cruel - and can have dangerous consequences for humans

Peta has already scored one victory, with the Moscow International Circus confirming this week that it will use only willing human performers and no animals in its upcoming shows at the Neal S. Blaisdell Center.

Peta Foundation Deputy General Counsel Delcianna Winders added: ‘As the world saw 20 years ago when Tyke lashed out and died bellowing on the street, forcing frustrated animals to perform in circuses can have deadly consequences. Peta supporters and kind people around the world will be relieved to hear that the Moscow International Circus is putting safety and kindness first and going animal-free in Hawaii.’

Acts that use big cats - as the Moscow International Circus had reportedly planned to do - also pose a risk to the public, Peta points out, as on average, captive big cats in the U.S. kill one person every year and injure 10 more.
