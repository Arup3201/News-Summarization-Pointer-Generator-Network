The FBI is investigating after several websites in the US were hacked by someone claiming to be from ISIS.

Websites including a racecar speedway in the state of Ohio, a cocktail bar in Massachusetts, a Goodwill center in Missouri and a church in Canada were defaced with the radical group's black flag.

Attacks against similar low-profile websites were also recorded in Montana, New York, Massachusetts and Minnesota, NBC reported.

The hacking has spread to Europe with the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre in Ireland the latest site to have its homepage topped by a picture of the black ISIS flag and the words 'hacked by ISIS, we are everywhere.' 

A Flash audio plugin played what appeared to be a song in Arabic.

Eldora Speedway General Manager Roger Slack told WLWT of Cincinnati: 'All of a sudden, our website was taken over by a hacker that took over a header stating that the website was now under the control of the Islamic State,'

The FBI said it was aware of the incidents and 'is contacting the impacted parties' though experts believe it is likely to be a hoax.

Evan Kohlmann of Flashpoint Intelligence, told NBC: 'There are no indications that the individuals behind these latest hacks have any real connection to ISIS, and these defacements have taken place amid a spate of recent attacks where ordinary hackers have cynically used far-fetched references to ISIS as a means of attracting media attention.'  

Southwest Montana Community Federal Credit Union's site has remained down, with the message 'Under Construction.' Chief executive, Tom Dedman, said the site was offline so a security specialist could investigate.

The hacks over the weekend appeared on websites with little or no link to one another, fueling speculation the terrorist organisation was not responsible. 

Silver Bow County Sheriff Ed Lester told station KTVM of Butte that no account information was compromised.

He said: 'I don't think ISIS agents would be interested in a hack like this,' Lester said. 'I think this is more likely a domestic hacker rather than international cyberterrorism.'
