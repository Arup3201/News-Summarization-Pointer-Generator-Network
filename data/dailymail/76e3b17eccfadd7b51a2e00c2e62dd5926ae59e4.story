Alan Catterall, 54, was burned to death at work when the door slammed shut on the industrial oven he was cleaning

A business has been  fined £200,000 over the death of a worker who became trapped inside an industrial oven which was then accidentally turned on by his future son-in-law.

Alan Catterall, 54, died while carrying out cleaning work at Runcorn-based Kayak company, Pyranha Mouldings in December 2010.

The father-of-three from Halewood, Liverpool, had gone inside to clean molten plastic escaping from a mould while the oven was switched off after a fault developed. 

Liverpool Crown Court heard the oven had developed a fault with a guide rail bearing and had been shut down for maintenance so the bearing could be fixed. 

But once the maintenance work had been completed the oven was switched back on by colleague Mark Francis, who was engaged to Mr Catterall's daughter, and put into warm-up mode.

A few minutes later smoke was seen coming from the oven and when operators opened the door to find the source they discovered Mr Catterall's body. He was pronounced dead at the scene.

The court heard Mr Catterall suffered severe burns and died of shock after becoming trapped in the large bespoke oven, which was designed to accommodate the moulds for two kayaks. 

He was a senior supervisor at the company, which manufactures kayaks and canoes, and had worked there for 12 years.

Pyranha Mouldings was also found guilty of two charges under the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974.

Peter Mackereth, 60, managing director of the company, was convicted of two charges under Section 37 of the Health and Safety at Work Act.

Sentencing was adjourned until today when the trial judge, sitting at the Royal Courts of Justice in London, imposed the £200,000 fine.

Mackereth was given a suspended sentence and a fine of £25,000. The judge imposed a total prison sentence of nine months, suspended for two years.

Mr Justice MacDuff awarded costs against the two defendants jointly in the total sum of £90,000.  

The judge said there were 'a number of serious failings in the design of this and other moulding ovens' - the design and commissioning of which had been done in-house.

Mr Justice MacDuff said Mr Catterall was 'by all accounts the most lovely of men', devoted to his family 'and loved by all'.

'He was a committed worker and had given 100% and more to his employers,' said the judge.

His wife Pearl had 'behaved with dignity throughout'.

He added: 'Her loss, I know, is nearly unbearable and she knows that I can do nothing to bring back her husband.'

Mr Catterall, 54, died while carrying out cleaning work at Runcorn-based Kayak company, Pyranha Mouldings in December 2010. Liverpool Crown Court heard the oven had developed a fault with a guide rail bearing and had been shut down for maintenance so the bearing could be fixed.  The company was today fined £20,000 

When announcing the fine to be imposed on the company, the judge said that what happened was 'in the true sense' an accident: 'It was an avoidable accident but nevertheless an accident; an accident courted by no-one.'

Referring to Mr Catterall's family, the judge said: 'At least they are able to understand that their loss was not caused by a deliberate unlawful act; rather it was a result of oversight, negligence, sins of omission and not of commission, but sins nevertheless.'

Sentencing Mackereth, he said: 'You do not need me to tell you how far short of your duty you fell. It was repeatedly brought home to you at the trial.

'You will have to live with the consequences of your actions for the rest of your life. The company may only act through its directors and senior officers.

'Whereas others were also involved, you had to accept that you took the lead in designing and commissioning these ovens. The company's failure was also your failure - although the full responsibility does not fall on your shoulders. Rightly you were not charged with gross negligence manslaughter.'

The judge said he fully accepted that Mackereth and Mr Catterall were friends 'and that you were also devastated by the loss'.

He told Mackereth: 'I have given the matter careful thought and have reached the conclusion that I should mark the gravity of your offending by imposing a prison sentence, albeit that there are circumstances which enable me to suspend that sentence.'
