A man whose heart stopped beating while he slept has claimed that he witnessed angels and spoke to God before miraculously waking up in hospital and recovering.

Don Houston, 62, who has a history of heart trouble, 
shared his story after recovering from the serious
 illness just before Christmas last year.

He said that while he was unconscious in an Oklahoma City hospital - with only machines keeping him breathing - he entered a white room before witnessing a parade of angels.

'It was just white,' he told KFOR. 'Everything was so surreal, so 
peaceful. It was not a dream. It was so real. I mean it was real. Angels
 were there. God spoke to me.'

An angel showed him two doors and was escorted through the 'door of second chances', he said.

'The angel said, "Don, come with me",'
 he said. 'We went through the doorway that she said and as soon as we 
went through that door I started hearing, "Don, Mr. Houston." It was doctors and nurses.'

The vivid experience took place after his wife Rita awoke in the night by the sounds of his death rattle and found he was not breathing and that his tongue was sticking out, according Paramedics Plus.

'I never suspected I’d go to bed and die but I did,' Mr Houston told KFOR.

Fears: His wife Rita had awoken in the night to discover he was not breathing and immediately called 911

Rita frantically called 911 and dispatchers gave her lifesaving CPR instructions over the phone.

Paramedics Frankie Burch and Carey Crump rushed to the scene, where they needed to use a defibrillator on three occasions to stabilize Don's heartbeat.

He was rushed to hospital in critical condition and taken to the intensive care unit - but doctors were uncertain if he would regain consciousness.

'A doctor came out and said there is no response,' Rita said. 'I asked the ER doctor if we could go pray for him because I didn't want to hear no more. He said yes we could. We went in and prayed.'

Near death: Mr Houston, from Oklahoma City, shocked doctors and his family by waking in the ICU

But to everyone's shock, he awoke - with the vivid story describing where he had been.

Mr Houston, a Christian, said that he is now inspired to tell people there is life after death.

'I do know for a fact, there is something out there and you're not alone,' he said.
