It would be lovely to think that Nick Cruwys will wake up soon to be told of the compassion and humility shown by a growing army of football supporters.

At the time of writing he is in a coma, fighting for his life after being ambushed by a group of Wolverhampton Wanderers fans as he made his way to the railway station after Watford's 2-2 draw at Molineux on Saturday.

A group of Wolves supporters were so ashamed of the incident that they set up a website, a page dedicated to raising money to pay for Cruwys's travel and tickets to future matches.

Cruwys was heading to Wolverhampton train station when he was subjected to an 'unprovoked attack'

The initial target was £1,000 but by Tuesday evening 1,672 people had raised £22,089.

Football can respond in the most remarkable ways, but these supporters know that society's fragile truce with the game ended when this vicious and unprovoked attack took place.

We have a tendency to move on so quickly, to switch on the television set, to sit down to watch Liverpool against Blackburn and then look forward to a mouth-watering FA Cup tie between Manchester United and Arsenal.

It is natural. Always looking forward, leaving the bad bits of the weekend behind and hoping for a better result for our team on Saturday. Nothing wrong with that, nothing at all.

But sometimes we must pause for thought, to return to the scene of the crime for a few salutary moments and think about this poor guy in a hospital bed, fighting for his life.

To wonder what it must be like for a family member to receive a call from the police telling them that their husband, their dad, their son, is lying in a hospital, in a coma, may never wake up.

Or to consider his friends, the people who witnessed this horrific attack as they made their way through that intimidating underpass near the stadium and headed for the railway station.

Or the innocent bystanders, the people who are frozen in time when these injudicious attacks take place. They, too, will be traumatised.

Then there are the perpetrators, the thugs who are responsible for this attack. Are they proud men today, or hiding like cowards?

Cruwys is a football fan like me or you, following his team - Watford, in this case - around the country on a Saturday afternoon.

There is a rising tide in the sport, the 'Who-Wants-Some?' culture creating waves again after more raw footage emerged from Villa Park last weekend. What is the motivation for this?

Please don't say a 5.30pm kick-off meaning lads full of ale, because that is no excuse either.

We cannot put a news value on someone's existence either, just because the team Cruwys follows do not play to the bells and whistles of the Barclays Premier League each weekend.

This is someone's life and we have a moral obligation to address these perplexing issues.

The 5.30pm kick-off in the West Midlands derby on Saturday was no excuse for the behaviour of the fans

West Midlands Police are making some progress in the hunt for the thugs who did this and an appeal for witnesses was retweeted 82 times over the past few days.

There is a desire to do more, to create an environment where tribal passion is not overwhelmed by people, however small their number, throwing punches, even in isolated incidents.

For Cruwys and his friends, who were among the 2,239 Watford supporters who made the trip to Wolves, the game was a real nail-biter. Leaving the ground they would have been pleased to get a point.

The Watford great Kenny Jackett, a long-serving player and former manager at Vicarage Road, is now manager of Wolves. He remains a popular figure with their fans.

Towards the end of a riveting 2-2 draw, Wolves defender Bakary Sako was sent off when Watford substitute Fernando Forestieri went down clutching his face.

That incident is not to be interpreted as a causal link because nothing that happened on a football pitch can ever justify what happened next.

To think Cruwys's day ended with his family being informed that he is in a coma takes us into unforgiving territory.

This is the unacceptable face of the game, a severe reminder that the sport must meet the needs of the supporters inside and outside stadiums.

According to Home Office statistics there were only 2,273 football-related arrests last year, which includes all four divisions, plus European competitions and internationals. It is the lowest since records began.

Last season 33 million people attended matches and less than 0.01 per cent of those in attendance were arrested.

The numbers look good on paper, but the Home Office also makes it clear that the police do not always have the manpower to make arrests.

If 5,000 fans stormed the pitch at Villa Park - theoretically every one of them should be arrested and banned

For example, let's say around 5,000 Villa supporters invaded the pitch at the end of their 2-0 victory over West Brom in the FA Cup quarter-final on Saturday.

Theoretically, every one of them could be arrested and banned from Villa Park for life.

It will never happen, which is why those Home Office statistics can easily be distorted.

There is certainly some grim reading in the West Midlands at the moment, with the police force making further appeals on Monday to jog the memory of anyone who witnessed the incident in Wolverhampton.

Wrong place, wrong time? Don't give me that.
