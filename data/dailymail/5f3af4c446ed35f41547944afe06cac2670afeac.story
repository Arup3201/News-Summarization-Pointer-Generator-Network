Barack Obama does not need to ask Congress for permission to launch air strikes in Iraq, top lawmakers have said.

After a meeting with Obama, Republican Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said the president 'indicated he didn't feel he had any need for authority from us for steps that he might take.'

Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic House Minority Leader, said in a statement after the meeting that Obama does not need 'any further legislative authority' for the options discussed so far.

Deployment: F-18 launches off the flight deck of the aircraft carrier USS George H.W. Bush during flight operations in the Arabian Gulf after the ship was deployed into the Gulf in response to the crisis in Iraq

The meeting came last night as it was 
revealed that U.S. pilots had already begun flying surveillance missions
 over Iraq in F-18 Super Hornet warplanes.

Iraqi
 Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki has asked President Obama for air 
strikes against the Sunni Islamist militants who have been carving a 
wide swath through his country.

Surprisingly,
 an administration official said it was the leaders who suggested Obama 
already had the power to take action in Iraq without a congressional 
rubber stamp.

The official 
downplayed the notion that Obama agreed with that assessment, saying 
only that the president said he would continue to consult with 
lawmakers.

As negotiations 
with Iraq continue, Vice President Joe Biden spoke Wednesday with Mr. 
Maliki, a Shiite, along with the country's Sunni parliamentary speaker and the the 
president of its self-ruled Kurdish region.

He
 praised their efforts to bring together their respective communities in
 a televised show of unity against the group Islamic State in Iraq and 
the Levant (ISIS), the White House said.

But former U.S. general David Petraeus, who led the 'surge' that finally brought calm to Iraq, struck a cautious note on Western intervention.

Speaking at a conference in London, General Petraeus said the Iraqi government needed to reach out to the Sunni minority before the US got involved militarily.

He said: 'If the US is to support the Iraqi government it would have to be a government against terrorism, rather than one side in a civil war.'

'This cannot be the United States being the air force for Shia militias, or a Shia-on-Sunni-Arab fight,' he told the Margaret Thatcher Conference on Liberty.

In
 a lightning advance over the past fortnight, Isis militants seized 
control of Mosul, Tikrit and other towns in Iraq as the country's 
military melted away.

A 
hurdle to U.S. military engagement could be political pressure in 
Washington for Maliki to quit. Several leading figures in Congress have 
spoken out against the PM, whom Obama has urged to do more to overcome 
sectarian rifts.

'The Maliki
 government, candidly, has got to go if you want any reconciliation,' 
said Dianne Feinstein, one of Obama's fellow Democrats, who chairs the 
Senate Intelligence Committee.

Republican
 senator John McCain backed military support but urged Obama to 'make it
 make very clear to Maliki that his time is up.'

Yesterday's surveillance missions mark the first declared U.S. flyovers since American troops left Iraq at the end of 2011.

US President Barack Obama meets with Congressional leadership including Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (2nd R), Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (L), House Speaker John Boehner (2nd L), and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (R), in the Oval Office of the White House on June 18, 2014 in Washington, DC. The leaders met to discuss strategy on Iraq

Reports 
first surfaced on Twitter from ABC, NBC and Fox News about the sorties, 
which are taking off and landing on the USS George H.W. Bush, an 
aircraft carrier in the Persian Gulf.

The Obama administration had already authorized 'manned and unmanned' surveillance flights, Fox News reported. But F-18s are not surveillance aircraft.

They are attack planes.

A
 U.S. official hinted to Fox that part of the strategy is to project 
strength by rolling out the big guns even on routine video and photo 
missions.

'It's not so much about looking as it is being seen,' the official said.

They need help: Iraqi Shiite tribal fighters are pushing back against ISIS, but Iraq's leaders are still asking the Obama White House for air strikes to slow them down

Getting closer: As ISIS moves toward Baghdad, its militants are detonating car bombs in the city, like this lethal blast on Wednesday in Baghdad's Shia-dominated Sadr City region

The White 
House told reporters on Wednesday afternoon that the president is still 
undecided about whether to commit military force to the country that 
once hosted 143,000 American servicemen and women.

Obama
 met with senior leaders of Congress from both major political parties 
at 3:00 p.m. Wednesday.

A White House statement following that meeting 
said he emphasized his position that Iraqâ€™s leaders should 'set aside 
sectarian agendas and to come together with a sense of national unity' 
in order to quell Shia-on-Sunni armed conflicts.

Obama, the statement said, also reviewed his 'options for increased security assistance' to Iraq.

The
 Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS), which until recently was known 
as 'Al-Qaeda in Iraq,' has captured Mosul, Tikrit, Tal Afar and parts of
 Iraq near the capital city of Baghdad.

The big picture: ISIS has taken the red-shaded areas in this map and are making progress in their advance toward Baghdad
