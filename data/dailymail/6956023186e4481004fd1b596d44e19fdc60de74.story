Nicola Moss, 29, was shamed into shedding the stones after a woman offered her a seat on her morning commute - mistakenly thinking she was pregnant.

Embarrassed Nicola hit the gym and began a strict diet - and the pounds were soon melting away.

And when her younger sister, Victoria, 26, saw how much weight she'd shed, she decided to sign up to the same diet - terrified she'd be known as the 'fat sister'.

After six months of spurring each other on through the tough times, the sisters, from Wansdworth, London, have lost almost 10 stone between them - and can now both slip into a size 10.

Nicola said: 'We have always been bigger than our other sisters - we are both quite tall so we've always just thought we are not meant to be skinny people.

'I'd noticed I was struggling to fit 
in my size 18 clothes, but it wasn't until the day someone assumed I was
pregnant that I actually did anything about my weight.

'I'd
managed to find a dress that I thought was quite flattering, but as 
soon as I stepped onto the train this lady looked at my stomach, smiled 
and offered me her seat.

'I
could have died of embarrassment. I couldn't bring myself to tell her 
that I wasn't pregnant, so I just said that I was getting off at the 
next stop.

'I went straight home in tears - and the first thing I did was log onto my computer and start looking up diets.

Nicola said she noticed she was struggling to fit in size 18 clothes, 'but it wasn't until the day someone assumed I was pregnant that I actually did anything about my weight'

'I remembered seeing Frankie Essex had lost weight on the Cambridge Weight Plan, so I signed up the same day.'

Within a few weeks, retail manager Nicola had lost more than a stone - and was the envy of her younger sister.

And after realising that Nicola was melting away before her eyes, Victoria also pledged to sign up to Cambridge - and like her sister, started shedding the pounds.

Since joining the plan in July, 5ft 8in Nicola has lost a staggering four and a half stone - shrinking from a whopping 15st 12lb and struggling to squeeze into a size 18 dress to a slender 11st 6lb - and a size 10 to 12.

And sister Victoria, who is 6ft tall,  now weighs just 12st 2lb - after originally tipping the scales at just under 17st.

The sisters say: 'Our mum is so proud of us - she can't believe how much weight we have lost'

Victoria, a teaching assistant, said: 'We've both managed to keep on track thanks to a bit of sisterly competition.

'When we were bigger, we used to convince each other that we were never supposed to be skinny girls - that we didn't have the skinny gene.

'But now, we've started to convince each other that there's no reason we can't fit into a size 10 - and we've helped each other get there.

'We were inconstant competition to keep up with each other's weight loss, and that kept us going.'

Nicola added: 'One night when our weight loss had had slowed a bit, I remember standing at the fridge, rummaging for chocolate.

'Then my phone beeped with a message, and it was Victoria saying she'd lost four pounds that week - I slammed the fridge shut straight away.

'We've both joined a gym and we try to go to work out together - it's so much easier when there's someone else egging you on.

'If you'd told us both we'd have been going to a gym a year ago we'd have both said you were mad - but it's true!

'Our mum is so proud of us - she can't believe how much weight we have lost.

'We keep getting compliments wherever we go and it's a great feeling.

'Over Christmas, we actually lost weight, rather than put it on - it was amazing.

'I'm sure we'll help each other motivated enough to keep it off too.'
