British adults today are more self-obsessed and worry more about their daily lives than those who lived through the Blitz, a new book claims.

This is despite the fact they don't have to worry about bombs, blackouts and rationing, says psychologist Graham Price.

He adds that today’s adults spend twice as much time fretting about their lives as those who lived through the Blitz.

British adults today are self-obsessed 
and 'consumed' with negative thoughts about their own personal problems from work and money to relationships, a psychologist has claimed

The book, The Promise, also claims that Britons have forgotten how to 'look on the bright side of life'.

Mr Price suggests the poster, Keep Calm and Carry On, would have worked during the Second World War but has less effect today, despite the slogan's recent resurrection.

The problem is that today's adults are 'consumed' with negative thoughts about their own personal problems from work and money to relationships, he believes.

In contrast, during the war there was a more positive attitude because it helped people to deal with what were much more serious problems all around them, said Mr Price.

Psychologist Graham Price claims we now worry more about our daily lives than those who lived through the Blitz (pictured in Birmingham) - and are also more stressed and likely to have anxiety problems

His book, described as ‘a handbook for personal development’, is based on his analysis of several hundred patients he has treated for stress or anxiety related issues.

From having a 'wartime spirit' while bombs were falling all around them in the 1940s, Britons now suffer from a 'stress epidemic', he said.

He added: ‘There's no doubt that people in war-torn Britain were seriously concerned about all manner of things, from the threat of invasion down to the state of their personal finance.

‘Yet records show they were able to keep things in perspective, which often meant looking on the bright side - even at the most difficult of times.

‘Resilience was then a cornerstone of the British character.

‘Modern Britons, on the other hand, are consumed with anxiety, most of which is brought on by non-life-threatening issues like employment, finance and relationships.

‘Compared to the war, we've never had it so good - but based on anxiety levels you wouldn't know it.’

Stress is now the most common reason for absence from work and has also been linked with increased rates of associated illnesses from dementia to high blood pressure, he said.

The positive attitudes of wartime Britons has led to Mr Price drawing up a stress-busting programme called Acceptance Action Training.

It encourages the Churchillian 'indomitable spirit' of the Second World War in dealing with problems and how to develop a positive attitude.

Mr Price said: ‘Maintaining a realistic, positive attitude to the problems that come our way got Britain through its darkest days.

‘Winston Churchill was the perfect embodiment of this.

‘He didn't waste time and energy dwelling on problems but instead accepted the situation and looked to what could be done to improve things going forward.’
