Former Emmerdale star Cy Chadwick has denied abusing a young boy when he was himself a teenager on the soap.

The 44-year-old, who played village bad boy Nick Bates for more than 10 years, is accused of the historic sexual assault during his first few years on the show.

Chadwick pleaded not guilty this morning to one charge of indecently assaulting a child between 1985 and 1988 - when he was aged 16 to 19.

He confirmed his date of birth and address and pleaded not guilty in a short hearing before Leeds magistrates this morning, where the case was referred to the crown court.

He was bailed to appear at court again later this month.

Chadwick is facing one charge of indecent assault of a boy under the age of 14.

The alleged offence is said to have happened in the Leeds area between September 1985, and September 1988.

It is thought he was first arrested in June after attending a police station voluntarily.

Chadwick joined the farm-themed ITV soap aged 15 and went on to become one of its highest earners.

He was on the show through its 5,000th episode and the peak of its popularity in 1993, when it reportedly drew 18 million viewers an episode.

Set in a fictional village in the Yorkshire Dales, the soap launched in October 1972 as Emmerdale Farm and shortened its name in 1989.

It was reportedly only due to last 13 weeks but continued when it won huge popularity.

Chadwick was one of its most high-profile actors and the fourth longest-serving cast member before he left in the mid-nineties to work in TV production.

His recent credits as a producer include World's Toughest Driving Tests on BBC Three, according to the film and TV website IMBD.

Chadwick made headlines in 1993 when he was snatched by three men who forced him to down a drugged drink and burgled his home.

He recovered in hospital, but the mystery was never solved.

Chadwick's arrest is not connected with Operation Yewtree, which is investigating claims of abuse by celebrities in the wake of the Jimmy Savile scandal.

However, it is thought the publicity surrounding the case could have been one factor which prompted the alleged victim to come forward.
