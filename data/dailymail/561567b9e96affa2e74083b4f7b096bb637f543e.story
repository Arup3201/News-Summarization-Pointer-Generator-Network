An Iranian national from Texas who admitted that he plotted to kill Saudi Arabia's ambassador to the U.S. by bombing a Washington restaurant was sentenced Thursday to 25 years in prison.

Manssor Arbabsiar, a U.S. citizen who was born in Iran, pleaded guilty in October to two conspiracy charges and a murder-for-hire count.

He admitted he was directed by Iranian military officials to go to Mexico on multiple occasions in 2011 to arrange the assassination attempt, which never occurred.

The 58-year-old Arbabsiar, who had 
worked in real estate and automobile sales since moving to the United 
States in 1977, approached someone he thought was a member of the 
Mexican narco-terror group, Los Zetas, for help with an attack.

The man turned out to be an informant for U.S. drug agents, who began recording their conversations.

‘What I did was wrong,’ Arbabsiar 
said in court Thursday. ‘I take responsibility for it. ... My mind 
sometimes is not in a good place.’

Prosecutors said Arbabsiar told the 
confidential government source that killing innocent bystanders, 
including U.S. senators who the source suggested would likely be at the 
restaurant, was ‘no big deal.’

The government said Arbabsiar told 
law enforcement officials after his arrest that he had demanded at least
$1million for his involvement in the plot.

He was also given $25,000 by the Quds
Force, a branch of the Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps that 
in 2007 was designated by the U.S. Treasury Department as a supporter of
the Taliban and terrorist organizations.

Defense lawyers argued for no more 
than a 10-year sentence, saying Arbabsiar's crimes were undeniably 
serious but also ‘the result of a severe mental breakdown caused by a 
longstanding, untreated bipolar disorder, and that he had no previous 
involvement in terrorism or international intrigue.’

Arbabsiar entered a guilty plea last October, admitting that he plotted to assassinate the Saudi ambassador. 

He was described by U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara at the time as 'the extended murderous hand of his co-conspirators, officials
of the Iranian military based in Iran, who plotted to kill the Saudi 
Ambassador in the United States and were willing to kill as many 
bystanders as necessary to do so.'

Attorney General Eric Holder cited the efforts of law enforcement and 
intelligence agencies in disrupting 'a deadly plot approved by members 
of the Iranian military to assassinate a sitting foreign ambassador on 
U.S. soil.'

Arbabsiar entered the plea to two 
conspiracy charges and a murder-for-hire count in U.S. District Court in
Manhattan.

When the plot was uncovered last September, President Barack Obama's administration accused agents of the Iranian government of being involved.

Bharara said Arbabsiar 'was in telephone contact with his Iranian confederates while he brokered an audacious plot.'

At the plea, Arbabsiar confirmed that officials in the Iranian military were involved in the plot

Arbabsiar admitted that he was directed 
by Iranian military officials to go to Mexico on multiple occasions from
the spring to the fall last year to arrange the assassination.

Arbabsiar, who lived in Corpus Christie, Texas, for more than a decade, said he went to Mexico last year to meet a man named Junior, 'who turned out to be an FBI agent.'

He said that he and others had agreed to arrange the kidnapping of the ambassador, Adel Al-Jubeir, but Junior said it would be easier to kill the ambassador.

Arbabsiar has been held without bail since he was arrested Sept. 29, 2011, at John F. Kennedy International Airport.

The government said in a news release
that Arbabsiar had described to the Drug Enforcement Administration source how his cousin in Iran, a
'big general' in the Iranian military, had requested that Arbabsiar 
find someone to carry out the ambassador's assassination.

It said Arbabsiar rejected as 'no big
deal' the DEA's worries about bystanders in a restaurant bombing, 
including the possibility that U.S. senators who dine there could be 
killed.

Authorities have said they secretly recorded conversations between Arbabsiar and an informant with the Drug Enforcement Administration after Arbabsiar approached the informant in Mexico and asked his knowledge of explosives for a plot to blow up the Saudi embassy in Washington. They said Arbabsiar later offered $1.5million for the death of the ambassador.

Arbabsiar admitted in October that he eventually made a $100,000 down payment wired from an overseas account through a Manhattan bank.

After his arrest, Arbabsiar confessed 
that he was recruited, funded and directed by men he believed were 
senior officials in Iran's Qods Force, a branch of the Iranian Islamic 
Revolutionary Guard Corps that in 2007 was designated by the U.S. 
Treasury Department as a supporter of the Taliban and terrorist 
organizations, the government said.

Arbabsiar told the court that he only understood about half of what he read out in court in English

It said he claimed that he met several 
times in Iran with Gholam Shakuri, a co-conspirator and Iran-based 
member of the Qods Force, and another senior Qods Force official. After 
his arrest, Arbabsiar made phone calls at the direction of law 
enforcement to Shakuri in Iran and Shakuri confirmed that Arbabsiar 
should move forward with the ambassador plot, the government said.

Iran formally complained to the U.S. in October 2011 over the claims that the Iranian government was involved in the plot to kill Adel Al-Jubeir.

The U.S. received a diplomatic note expressing displeasure with the charges. The complaint called on the U.S. to apologize publicly to Iran for the 'material and moral damages' caused by 'this baseless accusation.'

It added that the accusations violated 
'international rules and regulations' but that deception has become 'a 
permanent part of statecraft in the U.S.'

The note was delivered through the 
Swiss embassy in Tehran, which represents U.S. interests in Iran since 
the two countries don't have diplomatic relations.
