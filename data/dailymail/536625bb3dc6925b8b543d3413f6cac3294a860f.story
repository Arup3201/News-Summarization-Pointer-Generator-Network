A woman who spent months forming personal relationships online via fake dating profiles to get an inside look at romance scams was left stunned when a woman was willing to 'try' a same-sex relationship to get money. 

Sofija Stefanovic intentionally threw herself into the dark world of online dating after an elderly friend of hers went looking for love and was scammed out of more than $80,000.

In her quest to speak to a scammer, Sofija even went as far as using her dead relative's photo to set up her own senior's dating profile.

She documented the bizarre lengths scammers go to and the awkward flirty conversations she had in her new book, You're Just Too Good To Be True.

One of the potential love interests trying to win Sofija over was a person named Cindy - a so-called stylist from Senegal in Africa.

Cindy initially thought Sofija was a man and within a day of emailing each other she essentially declared her love. 

'When I open my heart for a man and I begine (sic) to have deep feelinsg (sic) for hims that means I fall in love so quick when I meet someone that I like,' Cindy wrote.

When she asked for pictures Sofija decided to come clean hoping to catch her off guard. She told her she was actually a woman and she only pretended to be a man to keep her talking.

'I want to know what you believe in. Do you like men or women? Cindy wrote. 

'I was thinking and believing in the way I was brought up, that a woman should like only a man. But I have come to realized that woman like womand (sic) and men same... I would love to try it with you. If you wouldn't mind.'

Cindy's snap decision to 'try' a same-sex relationship left Sofija stunned.

'(Scammers) have all these flattering things they copy and paste into conversations. I thought if I did something out of left field I'd catch her off guard. She was pretty amazing,' Sofija told Daily Mail Australia.

'I would really love to know who that was. You know, if it was an 18-year-old guy in some internet cafe laughing with his mates.'

Sofija pursued an online relationship with Cindy over several months mainly on instant messenger.

She called her a few times, but Cindy refused to have a Skype conversation. 

'Cindy was the most amazing scammer. She doesn't like soccer but I was watching the world cup and she ended up watching just for me,' Sofija said.

Within a day of emailing each other, Cindy essentially declared her love despite only just learning that Sofija was in fact a woman

'She watched it in order to get closer to me. She'd say things like "look how badly Brazil are playing".

'She went to the greatest lengths to remember things about me.'

Sofija said this was a common trend with the scammers she spoke to. 

'Some scammers belong to large syndicates and they're talking to lots of victims at once. They have these databases that could say: "This is Sofija, she likes the world cup".'

After months of talking, Cindy eventually asked Sofija for money by saying she was about to lose her home and needed money to get a place to stay.

'Some of these scammers spend a year in a relationship with you before they ask for money. They tell their victims everything they want to hear. They’ll tell them they’re beautiful and loved,' Sofija said.

'Scam victims are ridiculed in society, but it could happen to anyone. If you’re at a vulnerable point in your life - you’ve recently separated or widowed - scammers look for this stuff in your profiles.'

Sofija spoke with dozens of scammers and said she could absolutely see how they could get scammed. 

'It’s pretty easy to be played. Even though Cindy sent me this clearly copied response, I couldn’t help but feel flattered,' she said.

'I can absolutely understand why the people I’ve spoken to ... why it would be refreshing and wonderful to hear that stuff.

'A lot of the elderly scam victims are lonely and then there’s a person willing to talk to them all the time.'

Despite her efforts, Sofija wasn't able to convince a scammer to talk to her - even Cindy who declared her love.

'I really hoped that they would. Scammers are a variety of people, so I was hoping there would be someone who was bored or someone who wanted to show off. 

'No one admitted to be a scammer. I even got blocked by a couple – I’m probably the only person to be blocked by a scammer.'
