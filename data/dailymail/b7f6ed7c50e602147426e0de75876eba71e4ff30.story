Would Parmesan by any other name be as tasty atop your pasta? A ripening trade battle might put that to the test.

As
 part of trade talks, the European Union wants to ban the use of 
European names like Parmesan, feta and Gorgonzola on cheese made in the 
United States.

The argument is that the American-made cheeses are
 shadows of the original European varieties and cut into sales and 
identity of the European cheeses. The Europeans say Parmesan should only
 come from Parma, Italy, not those familiar green cylinders that 
American companies sell. Feta should only be from Greece, even though 
feta isn't a place. The EU argues it ‘is so closely connected to Greece 
as to be identified as an inherently Greek product.’

By any other name...: As part of free trade talks, the European Union is expected to propose to ban the United States from using certain European cheese names if the cheese is made here

So, a little ‘hard-grated cheese’ for your pasta? It doesn't have quite the same ring as Parmesan.

U.S. dairy producers, cheesemakers and food companies are all fighting the idea, which they say would hurt the $4 billion domestic cheese industry and endlessly confuse consumers.

‘It's really stunning that the Europeans are trying to claw back products made popular in other countries,’ says Jim Mulhern, president of the National Milk Producers Federation, which represents U.S. dairy farmers.

The European Union would not say exactly what it is proposing or even whether it will be discussed this week as a new round of talks on an EU-United States free trade agreement opens in Brussels.

European Commission spokesman Roger Waite would only say that the question ‘is an important issue for the EU.’

That's clear from recent agreements 
with Canada and Central America, where certain cheese names were 
restricted unless the cheese came from Europe. Under the Canadian 
agreement, for example, new feta products manufactured in Canada can 
only be marketed as feta-like or feta-style, and they can't use Greek 
letters or other symbols that evoke Greece.

It's Greek to me: Despite not being named for a specific place, the EU included feta cheese on its list of products they'd like renamed if produced in the United States

Though
 they have not laid out a public proposal, the EU is expected to make 
similar attempts to restrict marketing of U.S.-made cheeses, possibly 
including Parmesan, Asiago, Gorgonzola, feta, fontina, grana, Muenster, 
Neufchatel and Romano.

And 
it may not be just cheese. Other products could include bologna, Black 
Forest ham, Greek yogurt, Valencia oranges and prosciutto, among other 
foods.

The trade 
negotiations are important for the EU as Europe has tried to protect its
 share of agricultural exports and pull itself out of recession. The 
ability to exclusively sell some of the continent's most famous and 
traditional products would prevent others from cutting into those 
markets.

Concerned about the
 possible impact of changing the label on those popular foods, a 
bipartisan group of 55 senators wrote U.S. Trade Representative Michael 
Froman and Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack this week asking them not 
to agree to any such proposals by the EU.

Led
 by New York Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., and Pennsylvania Sen. Patrick
 Toomey, R-Pa., the members wrote that in the states they represent, 
‘many small- or medium-sized, family owned businesses could have their 
businesses unfairly restricted’ and that export businesses could be 
gravely hurt.

Schumer said artisanal cheese production is a growing industry across New York.

‘Muenster is Muenster, no matter how you slice it,’ he said.

Trevor
 Kinkaid, a spokesman for the U.S. trade representative, said 
conversations on the issue are in the early stages but that the U.S. and
 E.U. have ‘different points of view’ on the topic.

The
 agency wouldn't disclose details of the negotiations, but Kinkaid said 
the U.S. government is ‘committed to increasing opportunity for U.S. 
businesses, farmers and workers through trade.’

Large
 food companies that mass-produce the cheeses are also fighting the 
idea. Kraft, closely identified with its grated Parmesan cheese, says 
the cheese names have long been considered generic in the United States.

‘Such restrictions could not only be costly to food makers, but also potentially confusing for consumers if the labels of their favorite products using these generic names were required to change,’ says Kraft spokesman Basil Maglaris.

Feeling bleu: Gorgonzola was also among the cheeses whose names the EU covets

Some producers say they are incensed because it was Europeans who originally brought the cheeses here, and the American companies have made them more popular and profitable in a huge market. Errico Auricchio, president of the Green Bay, Wisconsin, company BelGioioso Cheese Inc., produced cheese with his family in Italy until he brought his trade to the United States in 1979.

‘We have invested years and years making these cheeses,’ Auricchio says. ‘You cannot stop the spreading of culture, especially in the global economy.’

He says that companies who make certain cheeses would have to come together and figure out new names for them, which would be almost impossible to do.

His suggestion for Parmesan? ‘I Can't Believe It's Not Parmesan,’ he jokes.

Jaime Castaneda works for the U.S. Dairy Export Council and is the director of a group formed to fight the EU changes, the Consortium for Common Food Names. He says the idea that only great cheese can come from Europe ‘is just not the case anymore.’

He points out that artisanal and locally produced foods are more popular than ever here and says some consumers may actually prefer the American brands. European producers can still lay claim to more place-specific names, like Parmigiano-Reggiano, he says.

‘This is about rural America and jobs,’ he said.

Similar demands could also be made over American-produced bologna, Black Forest ham, Greek yogurt, Valencia oranges and prosciutto
