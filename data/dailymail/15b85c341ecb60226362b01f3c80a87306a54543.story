It may have seemed like a clever advertising ploy but a company's attempt to use 'real' customers to promote itself has backfired after they were targeted in a series of Twitter attacks.

In the series of commercials Verizon FiOS urges viewers to contact Liana Rowe, Mike 'The Goose' Steinmetz and Regina Schneider who claim to love the company and want to share their experiences.

But instead of genuine inquiries about download speeds, the trio have been besieged by hundreds of irrelevant, odd and very funny questions.

Mike Steinmetz is one of the three Verizon 'real customers' who have been bombarded by irrelevant questions since the campaign began

Many of the questions have been about how much the three have been paid to promote Verizon

Questions have ranged from whether the 
three are actually robots to if the fast download speeds can help one 
user find his mother.

The three, who say they are real customers, have also been revealed to be working actors.

Rowe and Steinmetz work for New York theatre companies and Schneider is an actress based in Long Island.

They say while they have been 'incentivized' to promote the company, all their good experiences are genuine.

Garrett Wilson summed up the tone of most of the messages with his question to Mike Steinmetz: 'How much are they paying you to promote this s*** man.'

Liana Rowe, who is also a working actress, has been asked if she can help find one Twitter users mother and help another with his cocaine problem

Regina Schneider had to tell one another that she wants to talk about Verizon and not if she likes unicorns

When another user insinuated Liana Rowe was 
only talking about Verizon for the money she retorted: 'I don't know why
this upsets you so much. I'm trying to answer questions and help 
everybody out :)'

Many other Twitter users have wanted to know why she had not used her account for two years before the campaign began.

Mike wrote: 'Why no tweets in your 2 years history then all sudden you become activate. If you are fake then my whole life has been a lie.'

She replied: 'A lot of people ask that. I made a twitter just to followÂ  celebs and stuff. I used by fb for social networking. It's not fake.'

Each of the three featured customers has a disclaimer written on their page: 'This Twitter user is a real FiOS customer incentivized by Verizon to share his/her own opinions and thoughts on FiOS service.

'The thoughts and opinions expressed by participants in this program are completely independent of Verizon.'

However, when questioned neither of the three will reveal how much they have been paid to promote the company.

Other questions have been more unusual.

DJMarcRecordz pleaded with Rowe to use the company's fast speeds to help him find his mother, while some men were concerned with how quickly they would be able to download porn.

One man asked Schneider whether she liked unicorns and Lowe was asked to help one person with their cocaine addiction.

However, despite the provocation the Verizon trio do not seem able to retaliate but have to be polite at all times.
