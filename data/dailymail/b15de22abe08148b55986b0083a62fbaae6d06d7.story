Battle: Lewis Philbrick, 86, says he requested meetings with MoD bosses for years about his cancer but has been snubbed

A former navy mechanic who was diagnosed with cancer after being exposed to radiation at Nagasaki wants recognition from the Ministry of Defence bosses who he says have snubbed him for years.

Lewis Philbrick, 86, escorted scientists onto the Japanese island in September 1945, a month after the atomic bomb was dropped, killing 74,000 people.

He immediately started suffering bleeding gums, loose teeth and lip sores, and was diagnosed with cancer in 1984.

His face is disfigured after seven operations, in which part of his jaw and skull were removed.

Mr Philbrick, who now lives in Colchester, Essex, says he does not want compensation, he simply wants recognition that his service led to years of suffering.

Speaking on the eve of the 68th anniversary of Victory over Japan Day, he said: 'I can’t forget because every time I look in the mirror, it is there. My greatest worry is "when is it coming back?"'

He has requested face-to-face talks with MoD bosses after years communicating by letter.

Mr Philbrick said: 'All I can ask for is one-to-one talks, which gives me the chance to respond immediately to whatever it is the MoD representative comes back with.'

The Allies dropped a bomb in Nagasaki on August 9, 1945. Mr Philbrick escorted scientists to the area a month later.

He lost his cousin Gerald during the war in the Pacific and was one of the first people to witness the aftermath of the bomb, including finding Japanese prisoner of war camps.

Naval doctors diagnosed Mr Philbrick with gingivitis and later pleurisy. 

Mr Philbrick said: 'When I went to the
doctor at the time they didn’t take a great deal of notice because a 
lot of people were coming forward with symptoms and they were being put 
down to heat exhaustion.'

He
got home in 1946 and spent six months in Colchester Military Hospital 
before spells in the Red Cross Auxiliary Hospital and the Royal Naval 
Hospital.

The Ministry of Defence told MailOnline that Mr Philbrick applied for a Military Disablement Pension, but his case was rejected.

He applied to have the decision reconsidered at a tribunal appeal, at which an MoD panel ruled that his medical condition was unrelated to his service in the Armed Forces.

A spokesman said: 'War Disablement Pensions are payable in respect of illness or injury as a result of service in HM Armed Forces before 6 April 2005.

'All decisions follow careful consideration of all the service and medical evidence available and carry full rights of appeal to an independent Tribunal.'

She added that the MoD remains in contact with Mr Philbrick about his case.

Lethal: Smoke billows over the Japanese city of Nagasaki after an atomic bomb was dropped in 1945

An atomic bomb weighing more than 4,000kg was dropped on Nagasaki by parachute from an American B29 Bomber at 11.02 local time on 9 August, 1945.

Nicknamed 'the Fat Man', in reference to Winston Churchill, it exploded 500metres above ground and completely destroyed the city which lies on the western side of the Japanese island of Kyushu.

It was the second attack by the United States on a Japanese city in three days.

More than three million leaflets had been dropped over the country from American aeroplanes warning the Japanese people that more atomic weapons would be used 'again and again' unless the war was ended immediately.

The Japanese surrendered less than a week later on August 14. The two attacks on Hiroshima and Nagasaki remain the only use of nuclear weapons in war to date.

The war in Europe ended when Nazi Germany surrendered on May 8, but the Pacific War had continued.

The use of atomic bombs by the United States remains one of the most controversial moments in human history.
