A young teacher has revealed that she was attacked by a murderer on her way home from a night out - but managed to save her own life by befriending the vicious killer.

Jessica Price was assaulted in the street by Carl Powell, who attempted to strangle her and dragged her to a remote spot to kill her.

But she started talking to him and shared a cigarette, convincing him not to harm her and escaping unhurt.

After the 23-year-old called police to report her ordeal, she learned that he had killed another young woman in almost identical circumstances just a month earlier.

Altercation: Ms Price sweet-talked Powell into releasing her by making him think she was flirting

Powell, 24, who confessed to being a 
career criminal during his conversation with Ms Price, was jailed for 
life in October for murdering mother of two Caroline Coyne.

Ms
Price, who works as a teacher in Italy, was walking through Nottingham 
city centre after a night out with friends in August 2011.

Because the streets were deserted, she was unable to call for help when Powell approached her and physically overpowered her.

So instead, she started a conversation with him, asking him about his life and convincing him she was trying to flirt.

'I've always been good at talking,' she said this week while recounting the attack. 'This time my talent saved my life.'

She
faced her would-be killer again last week when she agreed to testify at
his trial for the murder of Ms Coyne, overcoming her fears in order to 
secure justice for the young mother.

Struggle: But Ms Price calmed him down and they later walked hand-in-hand down the road

Brave: Ms Price has waived her anonymity to speak out and condemn the murderer

'Being a key witness in a murder trial was nerve wrecking, but I knew I wasn't just there for me,' Ms Price said.

She had recently returned from travelling overseas and was enjoying a reunion with friends on the night of the attack.

Although
the evening did not wrap up until 3am, she decided to walk the 40 
minutes to the family home alone, as she was very familiar with the 
route.

She listened to 
her iPod on the walk, but when she noticed a stranger catching up with 
her she turned down the volume in order to be on the alert.

Ms Price decided to ask Powell for the time, in order to distract him in case he was planning to attack.

However, seconds later he lunged at her, wrapping his hands around her neck and throttling her.

'I couldn't breathe at all,' she said. 'I was terrified. I struggled, but as hard as I tried, I couldn't pull his hands away. He was too strong.

'With the little breath I had left inside me, I managed to say "please" but he kept on telling me to shut up. I thought that was it. I just thought I was going to die.' 

Although Powell flung Ms Price to the
floor, leaving her mobile phone out of reach, she maintained her 
composure and got the attacker to sit next to her.

'In
that situation, I always thought that I would be really nice and really
calm,' she continued. 'If I could get the person on side, then they 
might reconsider. So, that was my plan. When he took his hands off me, I
stayed quiet. Catching my breath, I managed to tell him I wouldn't make
a sound, and he took a step back. That's when I knew my plan was 
working.

'I told him 
he could take whatever he wanted. I didn't have any money, but I offered
him my iPod. He said to me, "Do I look like I need money?" He had this 
arrogant swagger about him. He told me he didn't know what he wanted.

'I
don't usually smoke, but when he lit a cigarette I asked for a drag, if
only so he could see I had something in common with him.'

Now that Powell had calmed down, Ms Price began to talk to him and asked him about himself.

'I
said, "You should have just said something to me if you wanted to 
talk." His whole attitude began to change as he started chatting with 
me. He even ran out to snatch my bag back from the street.

'I
was asking where he had been in town. Just something to keep him 
occupied. I needed to convince him everything was fine. There was no way
I could have run - he was blocking my exit and I'm not fast at the best
of times.

'He even 
apologised for scaring me. After a while, I just said to him, "Look, 
you're headed in the same direction as me. Let's walk together".' 

He clutched her hand as they started 
walking back up to the main road, with Mr Price making a mental note of 
where Powell dropped his cigarette butt.

She
persuaded him to take his hood down, saying she wanted to see his face -
and ensuring she would be able to identify him after his arrest.

Horror: But Ms Price agreed to testify at Powell's trial in an attempt to win justice for Ms Coyne

'Anyone
who saw us would have assumed we were a couple but I was desperate to 
get away,' she said. 'I was still keeping him talking. I asked how he 
made his money. He said, "Mostly naughty stuff."

'He
was holding my hand and trying to kiss me. I'm sure he was convinced 
that he had pulled me. When he leaned in to kiss me, I pulled away and 
he said, "I thought you had forgiven me?"

'I
told him I needed to get home as my mum would be frantic. Then he said 
to me, "At least feel what you're doing to me," and he shoved my hand 
down his trousers. I squirmed as he smiled.'

Powell
received a phone call, which gave Ms Price an excuse to leave - but she
agreed to exchange numbers with him to keep up the pretence of 
friendship

She immediately phoned home to her mother, and told her to call the police if she hadn't returned within five minutes.

After
getting home, she phoned 999 and reported her encounter to police, who 
quickly connected it to the murder of 28-year-old Ms Coyne a month 
earlier.

The care assistant had, like Ms Price, been walking through Nottingham late at night when she failed to return home.

Her body was found in an alley between two houses, and officials determined she had been strangled then bludgeoned to death.

'The detectives explained how Caroline had been killed and how they believed that my attacker was the killer,' Ms Price said. 'I could have been his next victim. After he attacked me and when I got him talking, it felt like he was backing down from something.'

Police were able to match DNA from the cigarette butt to Powell, and he was convicted of murder a year later at Nottingham Crown Court.

Ms Price came face-to-face with her attacker during his trial, and burst into tears when he was found guilty of sexual assault, false imprisonment and murder.

'I flew back from Italy for the trial,' she said. 'It was nerve-wrecking, but I knew why I was there - for me and for Caroline. Giving evidence behind a screen was an option, but I decided against it. I wasn't afraid of him.

'I'd been waiting over a year for justice and at last I could move on.'
