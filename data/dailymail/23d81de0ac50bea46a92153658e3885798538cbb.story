Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner is reluctant to pay a group of New York hedge funds nearly £900million, fearing other creditors will also demand money

Argentina was last night locked in last-ditch talks with investors as it battled to prevent a second default since the turn of the century.

The Latin American country had until last night to pay lenders £320million in interest payments or default on its debts.

But court orders required Buenos Aires to also pay a group of New York hedge funds nearly £900million at the same time – something the Argentinian government was reluctant to do.

Economy minister Axel Kicillof was in talks last night in a bid to strike a deal with the so-called ‘holdout’ investors and stave off a second default in 13 years.

The country was told to hand over £320million in interest payments to bondholders who agreed to take a 70 per cent cut on their holdings following the financial crisis that rocked the country in the early 2000s.  

But a New York judge has forbidden the transfer of the funds to take place unless Argentina also pays £900million to another group of ‘holdout’ creditors – a group of US hedge funds that are demanding repayment in full.

President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner fears that granting what she considers to be the ‘vultures’ their wish could trigger claims from the investors who had previously accepted losses to also demand full repayment. 

It is feared that a default would plunge Argentina deeper into recession, push up inflation and send the currency tumbling on the international markets.

Last week, Olivier Blanchard, chief economist at the International Monetary Fund, warned that the economic cost to Argentina of defaulting again might be 'substantial'.

'I think that for Argentina, if it goes into default and doesn't pay the holdouts, there might be substantial costs in being basically unable to access markets for some time,' he said.

But IMF managing director Christine Lagarde last night tried to play down fears that a default would send shockwaves through emerging markets worldwide.

'While default is always regrettable, we do not believe that it would have major substantive consequences outside, on a much broader basis,' she said.

The Argentine government had until last night to repay investors £320million, but problems arose after a New York judge banned the payments from taking place unless hedge funds were paid £900million
