A new charity auction is giving fans of the hit ITV show Downton Abbey the chance to live like the Earl and Countess of Grantham for the night at Highclere Castle.

The online auction is being staged by Christie's and will allow people the chance to bid for the opportunity to dine like the show's characters and spend the night at the Berkshire country house where the drama is filmed.

The sale, which launched on Friday, aims to raise money for Armed Forces charities and 
coincides with the commemoration of the centenary of the start of the First 
World War.

The 12 experiences on offer in the Heroes At Highclere auction include a dinner for eight in the dining room at 
Highclere Castle, and an overnight stay for six people in Lady Sybil’s, 
Lady Edith’s, and Lady Cora’s quarters.

The starting bid for dinner is £5,000 while the overnight stay - which offers three couples the chance to enjoy cocktails and dinner with the Earl and Countess of Carnarvon before bedding down in the quarters used in the period drama - is expected to go for upwards of £10,000.

Also on offer is a picnic for four in the castle's grounds (upwards of £250), a visit to the Egyptian exhibition in the castle's cellars (upwards of £500), and a behind-the-scenes tour of the House of Lords, plus afternoon tea at The Goring Hotel, with Baroness Jenkins (upwards of £2,000).

Those who prefer to explore the other side of life at the stately home can bid for a cookery lesson with resident chef Paul Brook Taylor from £500, or a private lesson from the Highclere butler, who will teach them how to set a table for a banquet from £2,000.

And those who want a more lasting memory of their visit - and the chance to decorate their own stately pad - can bid to have their portrait painted in front of Highclere Castle by artist Ronnie Sichel, from £1,500.

Rare opportunity: Bidders are being given the chance to live like their favourite Downton Abbey characters

The auction, which will continue until August 14, comes as the property stages an exhibition today called Centenary Stories featuring a number of period artefacts which will be used to explain the experiences of many of those who were involved in the First World War.

As depicted in the show, Highclere Castle was turned into a military hospital during the First World War.

The artefacts on display include items such as a silver medal for growing vegetables to sustain the troops in the trenches. They will also be displayed on the Christie's website until January.
