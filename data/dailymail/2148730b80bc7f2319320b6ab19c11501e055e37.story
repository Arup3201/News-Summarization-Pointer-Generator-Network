A jury has heard the chilling phone call from a man to his estranged wife the night before he is accused of stabbing her to death.

The jury at Maidstone Crown Court heard the phone call Ivan Esack, 38, made to Natalie Esack, 33, on April 29 this year, which was recorded by her shocked boyfriend Justin Khadaroo, 31, who was listening in.

Esack, a former policeman, asked her: ‘How do you want to f*****g play it then?’

Mrs Esack asked him what her options were and Esack replied: ‘Death, death or death.’

Before the stabbing: Ivan Esack (left) made a chilling phone call to his estranged wife Natalie Esack (right) in which he said he was 'going to absolutely f*****g murder you,' the night before she was stabbed 11 times in her hair salon

The next morning Mrs Esack was stabbed 11 times at her hair salon in front of her horrified teenage colleague in Ashford, Kent.

During the recorded phone call, Esack also said: ‘You're f*** [...] a f***ing Afghan behind my f***ing back and you think I am just going to f***ing let that go?’

‘You are f*****g dead. You are absolutely f*****g walking dead.

‘Seriously babe, I'm going to absolutely f*****g take great pleasure in doing what I'm going to do to you.

‘You are going to f*****g die. I'm going to f*****g murder you, seriously. Is that what you f*****g want?

‘You are a f*****g skanky little f*****g slut. I can't wait till I 
f*****g ... ruin ...Do you realise I'm going to f*****g really hurt you?

‘You can lock the doors all you f***ing want in your f***ing skanky house. But you can’t f***ing hide from me can you.’

Esack also texted her that night: ‘You really have pushed me to the brink now... You had better phone me or Archie (her baby nephew) will never got to know this.’

Prosecutor Philip Bennetts asked Mr Khadaroo what happened immediately
after the phone call.

Mr Khadaroo said: ‘After that phone call, Natalie
just looked at me. I shook my head in disbelief. I couldn't believe 
really what I was hearing. How do you react to that? It is just 
chilling, it is just not human.

‘She looked at me, I gave her a hug and she said: “It's going to be alright Justin, it's going to be alright.”

When asked why he had recorded the conversation rather than act on it, Mr Khadaroo told the court: ‘Natalie didn't want at this stage to go to the police. I decided I would take it upon myself to start building as much as evidence as possible for when the time came.

‘Unfortunately for me it was too late.’

Mr Khadaroo and Mrs Esack spent that night together at her father’s house before Mr Khadaroo left for work at 7am the next morning.

He said 'I will see you later' and asked her to call him straight away if anything happened.

But
at around 9.30am he had a phone call from her brother Luke Wilkinson  telling him 
to go to the police station because ‘something had happened,’ the court 
heard.

He said: ‘As soon as the policeman 
told me I just fell to my knees. I was inconsolable, how do you react to
that? It doesn't happen in real life, stuff like this. You see it in 
the movies.

‘I can't begin to describe to you how I feel. I wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy.’

Salon stabbing: Esack's phone conversation was recorded by Mrs Esack's boyfriend Justin Khadaroo who said of the conversation: 'It is just chilling, it is just not human' before she was murdered at her salon (right)

Mr Khadaroo told the court he had 
pleaded with Mrs Esack to take out a restraining order against the 
‘vile, disgusting monster’ to stop him harassing her with abuse and 
threats.

Mr Khadaroo said he spoke to Esack during the phone conversation.

He
told the court: ‘I said to him that everything he could possibly do 
wrong in life as a human being, bar murdering someone, he had done. He’s
a vile, disgusting monster.

‘I
urged Natalie so many times to get a restraining order on him so she 
was at least a little bit safe, but it came down to the fact she wanted 
to make sure that he was OK.

‘I was very concerned. She was connected to an atrocious creature that was capable of killing her.

‘She said he was particularly controlling. While she was at work all day, he would be at home sleeping with various prostitutes.

‘He didn’t allow her to see any of her friends, because all of her friends were “whores” and were beneath him.’

Tributes as trial continues: Mr Khadaroo said he pleaded with Mrs Esack to take out a restraining order against Esack

Mrs Esack’s 17-year-old salon assistant Chelsea Ford wept as she told the jury earlier how after the killing, Esack strode out on to the High Street, saying: ‘She deserved it, the bitch.’

Mr Bennetts described Esack as ‘a violent and controlling person who was unable to deal with the separation from his wife’ and killed her because he did not want her to be with anyone else.

Esack admits stabbing his wife but denies murder, claiming he is guilty only of manslaughter while his mind was unbalanced by ‘narcissistic personality disorder’ and ‘substance abuse’.

Her brother told the court today she was ‘the happiest I’d seen her for many years’ when he saw her just two days before she died.

Mr Wilkinson credited her happiness to being apart from Esack and in a relationship with Mr Khadaroo.

He said he saw his sister on April 28, two days before she was killed.

Mr Wilkinson said: ‘She was absolutely excited. She was on her way for a night out and she was the happiest I’d seen her for many, many years. She was going to a party with Justin and his friends.’

The court heard Esack and his wife 
met around ten years ago and married in 2006. She later opened Esack 
Hair and Beauty in Ashford, Kent.

Although
she ran her own business, Esack was bullying and 
controlling, the jury heard – never allowing his wife out without 
knowing where she was.

One
Christmas a few years ago she suffered a badly swollen cheek and eye, 
Mr Bennetts said, after her husband punched her. In July last year Mrs 
Esack told a relative he had threatened her with a knife.

In October last year Mrs Esack left 
the marital home and went to live with her brother. Mr Bennetts said 
Esack then made such frightening threats to use his legally-held shotgun
to kill his wife, himself, and their dog, that she called the police.

Esack voluntarily handed over the gun but continued with his abuse and threats, the court heard.

During
the separation, Mrs Esack began a new relationship but just before last
Christmas was persuaded to return to her husband after he broke down 
crying.

On Boxing Day, she went on a make-or-break holiday to Mexico with Esack – but returned with a massive bruise on her thigh, saying he had kicked her.

The couple separated again and abusive calls continued, the jury heard. Some were recorded by Mrs Esack and were played in court. Esack was heard saying: ‘You’ve signed your own death warrant’.

Matters came to a violent end in April after Mrs Esack went to a party with her new boyfriend and accidentally called her husband. He heard the pair talking and became aware of how serious her new relationship was.

The next day, the court heard, he bought a knife and went to her salon, stabbing his wife at the reception desk. As she tried to flee, he grabbed her and continued to knife her in the back.

Mr Khadaroo told the court he had started dating Natalie in October last year after her six-year marriage broke down and she moved in with her father.

He said: ‘She was an absolutely beautiful woman. We chatted and laughed. The evening went fantastically well. We just connected immediately.’

The trial continues.
