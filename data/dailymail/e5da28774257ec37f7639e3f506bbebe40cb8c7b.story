A recycling bin thief was snared after a GPS device was concealed in a teddy bear and planted in a bag of clothing that he eventually took.

Mid-Atlantic Clothing Recycling in Georgia had complained to police that they had been experiencing thefts from their collection bin at the Georgia Square Mall in Athens.

According to Athens-Clarke County police, the manager of the recycling company planted the GPS device inside the cuddly toy and put it inside a bag of clothes before throwing it in the collection bin.

And when the manager realised that the bear was moving thanks to the GPS device, they called the police, who tracked down the alleged thief, named as Melvin Junior Wilder, to the Clarke Crossing Shopping Centre.

He was found removing bags from a car and placing them in a donation bin, saying the items had been left over from a flea market sale.

He also added that a bag on the backseat of his vehicle, the one containing the bear, had come from his home.

However, when an officer showed him the GPS device from the bear, he allegedly confessed to stealing the clothing.

The clothing he is accused of taking was worth $1-per-pound and police say he took $40 worth of goods.

Wilder, 55, was charged with misdemeanor theft and then released from custody after posting a $1,500 bond.

Mid-Atlantic Clothing is a clothing recycling company, who have collection bins in car parks of shopping centres and other buildings in several U.S. states.

They sell the items to a variety of brokers but donate a percentage of their profits to the charity DARE America.
