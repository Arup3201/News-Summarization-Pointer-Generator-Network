Steve Ross claims that when his father shot his mother in the neck this Christmas season, it was a 'blessing on two fronts.'

That's because when his mom, 75-year-old Charlene Ross, arrived at an Akron hospital following the accidental shooting, she discovered she had an undiagnosed heart condition.

Steve's 77-year-old father, Boyd Ross, told police a shotgun went off Sunday in his son's home in York Township as the man was checking to see if it was loaded.

The Medina Gazette reports that the Stevens Model 320 12-gauge was loaded with 'birdshot' and fired through a closet wall into the back of the chair where his wife was sitting.

Boyd was planning to take the shotgun out from the closet to scare geese away from a pond on the property.

One pellet ripped through the armchair and grazed the woman on the neck, leaving a 4-inch cut, Steve said. The other pellets stayed lodged in the chair. 

After she was airlifted to Akron City Hospital, medical staff found she suffered from arrhythmia, or irregular heartbeat, that had gone unnoticed because she hadn't seen a doctor for several years.

'My father had said she hasn’t been feeling well and it turns out that she has been having arrhythmia attacks,' Steve said. 

A pacemaker was implanted Friday afternoon and Steve said later that his mother was 'up and running around.' 

'Had this accident not happened, my mom could have been gone at any time,' he said. 'You hate to use cliches, but this is a Christmas miracle.' 

Still, Steve said he nurses a slight twinge of guilt over the accident, since he was the last to use the gun and his father normally keeps it unloaded.

'I’ve been battling with this aspect because in a way it is my fault,' he said. “I should have unloaded it before he arrived at the house.' 

The Medina County Sheriff's Office said it was investigating the shooting as an accident.
