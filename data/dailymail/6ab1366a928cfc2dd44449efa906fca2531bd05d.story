A U.S. district court has fined TV host Ryan Seacrest's Typo Products  for violating an injunction barring it from selling a $99 iPhone case found to have likely infringed on BlackBerry patents.

U.S. District Judge William Orrick in San Francisco ordered Typo on Wednesday to pay BlackBerry $860,600 (£567,303) in sanctions, plus attorneys' fees and costs incurred in connection with Typo's violation of the injunction.

BlackBerry had filed a suit in January 2014 against Typo, co-founded by 'American Idol' host Seacrest, alleging that the physical keyboard it makes for some of Apple's iPhone devices infringed on the Canadian smartphone maker's design patents.

The Typo Keyboard, pictured, costs $99 (£60) and is due to launch in January at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas for the iPhone 5 and 5S. Other phone and tablet versions will then follow later next year

Although the keyboard slides onto the bottom of the phone, it actually connects to the software via Bluetooth.

When a user wants to write a message, 
email or Facebook post, for example, they can type on the physical 
keyboard and the key strokes will be sent wirelessly to the phone in 
real-time.

The case adds a quarter of an inch thickness to the bottom of the Apple handset, and around an inch to the length.

In March, the court issued a preliminary injunction that barred Typo from selling the physical keyboard iPhone case.

A spokeswoman for Typo in an email said that the ongoing litigation and fine relates to the initial Typo product and does not impact its since redesigned keyboard product.

'It has no impact on the Typo 2 product currently in the marketplace, or our other planned product releases for the tablet,' the company said in an email, declining to comment any further on the matter.

BlackBerry, which had asked the court to fine Typo $2.64 million for violating the injunction, declined to comment on the matter, stating merely that the court order speaks for itself.

The court, in an order issued on Wednesday, said that Typo had sold nearly 19,000 of the keyboards after the preliminary injunction had been issued.

Typo argued that BlackBerry has not shown that it has lost any sales as a result of Typo's conduct and that a fine would constitute an undeserved windfall for BlackBerry.

The judge agreed it was unclear to what extent BlackBerry had been damaged, but added that 'Typo's not so clever attempts to evade the court's preliminary injunction' were quite transparent.

'The amount of sanctions awarded is only a third of what BlackBerry sought and is directly tied to additional revenue that Typo could have expected from its illegal conduct,' said judge Orrick, in the order. 

Seacrest is said to have invested $1million in the phone keyboard, and he is shown as a co-founder on the Type Products company website.

According to the Typo Products site: 
'When we set out to design the Typo Keyboard, our goal was simple: 
create a keyboard and case that would add the absolute minimum 
additional length and thickness to the iPhone, while still providing 
protection to the phone and a butter-smooth, tactile typing experience.'

The gadget is set to launch at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas in January.

The
 company added: 'For several years, many of our friends carried two 
phones: one for typing and correspondence and an iPhone for virtually 
everything else.

'One night, we were out to dinner and both had our phones on the table.

'Two people, four phones! We looked at each other and thought there was an easy solution to the problem, a keyboard for the iPhone.

'That's when we decided to take matters into our own hands and the Typo Keyboard was born.'

However, it is not the first keyboard adapter for touchscreen devices.

BoxWave produces cases that have keyboards that slide from the bottom of iPhones and other touchscreen devices.

The OEM Slider board is similar, but slides from the side of the handset, whereas the Concord Keystone Swivel board has a keyboard built into a flip case.
