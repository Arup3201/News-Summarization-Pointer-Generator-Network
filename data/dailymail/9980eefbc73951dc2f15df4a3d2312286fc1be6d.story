The estranged wife of tragic motorcycle stunt rider Eddie Kidd  has been charged with beating the severely disabled star.

Samantha Kidd, 44, faces six charges of assault between July and October.

The former model and actress was arrested on December 11 following reports to police of domestic violence.

Mr Kidd, 53, who was left paralysed 
and brain-damaged when an attempt to jump over 13 buses went wrong in 
1996, recently split from his wife after five years of marriage.

She moved out of the home they shared 
in Seaford, near Brighton, while Mr Kidd changed his Facebook status 
from ‘married’ to ‘single’.

Meanwhile the former daredevil was said to be consulting lawyers about a divorce.

At the time of the split friends of 
Mrs Kidd, whose husband is confined to a wheelchair and needs round the 
clock care, said: ‘Sami had to do absolutely everything for him.’

A police spokesman said the charges had been brought following a ‘prompt and thorough investigation’.

Mrs Kidd has been bailed with strict conditions not to contact her husband or to visit the area where he lives.

She is due to appear before Brighton Magistrates’ Court on Wednesday, January 9.

A police spokesman said: ‘We take all 
allegations of domestic abuse seriously and encourage people to have the
confidence to report, whether by those who are being afflicted or 
others who have concerns.

‘We will work with partners to provide
support and always seek the best solution for victims, bringing 
appropriate offences to court.’ Mr Kidd, who was previously married to 
Hot Gossip dancer Debbie Ash and ex-Stringfellows nightclub waitress 
Sarah Carr, first met the current Mrs Kidd in 1988.

He left her heartbroken when he dumped
her after dating and she later claimed she had turned down six 
proposals from other men after that time.

They later met by chance at a party in Mayfair in 2004, before meeting again three years later and beginning a relationship.

Mrs Kidd has previously said: ‘To me, he was the most gorgeous man who’d walked this earth.’

The former stuntman was left in a coma for three-and-a-half months after his bike jump went wrong.

He broke his neck, pelvis and suffered
brain damage when his head hit the motorbike’s petrol tank during a 
stunt at the Bulldog Bash annual motorcycle festival, near 
Stratford-upon-Avon.

Since the accident Mr Kidd, who has 
three children from previous marriages, has been confined to a 
wheelchair, unable to talk or walk unaided and requires full-time care.

Last year he completed the London 
Marathon nearly two months after setting out and was awarded the OBE in 
the Queen’s Birthday honours list in June.

He first stunned spectators in 
December 1979 when he jumped 80ft across a derelict railway bridge in 
Essex on a 400cc Yamaha motorbike.

His achievements culminated in 1993 
when he jumped the Great Wall of China and beat Robbie Knievel, son of 
Evel Knievel, to the stunt bike world championship.

He worked as a stunt double in many 
films, appearing for Timothy Dalton in the Living Daylights, Roger Moore
and Michael Caine in Bullseye! and Pierce Brosnan in GoldenEye.
