One angry father demands to know why his daughter's biology substitute teacher decided to demonstrate what a body at rest looks like - by sleeping instead of teaching the class.

Rob, who has an 11th grader at Olive Branch High School in Memphis, Tennessee said that the teacher slept through most of the 90-minute class.

Rob's daughter managed to snap a photo of the sleeping teacher who manage to catch a hearty nap despite students giggling and taking photos.

Catching some Zs: This substitute teacher at Olive branch High School was photographed by students taking a nap during an entire hour and a half class 

Angered father: Rob's daughter came home to show him a photo of her teacher sleeping and he posted the photo on Facebook and reported the incident to the school principal 

'I put it on Facebook and just said, "Look at my daughter's substitute teacher,"' he told WMC Action News.

Even though students found the teacher's paid nap time amusing parents felt as though their children weren’t being granted the quality education they deserve.

'I'm trying to get her to do good in school,' Rob said.

Rob's daughter told him that the substitute teacher handed his students a packet and then fell asleep, only waking up a for a few seconds at a time as students laughed at him.

'I'm not looking to get anybody fired or have somebody not be working during Christmas, but they need to be aware this is going on,' Rob said.

Rob told the school's principal about the photo and they are currently investigating the matter further. 

Rob's daughter told him that substitutes frequently hand the students a packet to work on in the teacher's absence and  sit at their desks and some of them fall asleep.

Investigation: The school said they are investigating the incident so that this doesn't happen again in the future
