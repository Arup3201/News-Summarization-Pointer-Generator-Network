Law enforcement: Holritch Rivette was a Seminole County Sheriff's Office deputy for six months when authorities apprehended him Saturday

A Florida deputy has been accused of sexually battering and molesting a teenage girl.

Holritch Rivette was a Seminole County Sheriff's Office deputy for six months when authorities apprehended him Saturday, WESH reported.

The 33-year-old now faces three felony counts of lewd or lascivious battery, and two felony counts of lewd or lascivious molestation, according to the television station. 

Seminole County Sheriff's Office (SCSO) spokeswoman Kristen Bentsen told WESH 'He was terminated once we learned of his arrest, he was actually served with termination papers during his booking process.

'He was on probationary status with us, as he started on 9/30/2014 as a Deputy Sheriff.'

The Orange County Sheriff's Office (OSCO) arrested Rivette, OSCO spokeswoman Jane Watrel told WESH.

Watrel told the television station 'Our investigators did a very thorough job at looking at what the young woman was saying.

'They believed her, they found proof, and they filed some very serious charges against this individual.'

Alleged abuse: A teenage girl claimed Rivette engaged in intercourse with her over a twelve-month period

The SCSO sent Daily Mail Online a statement on Tuesday, which said 'Orange County S.O. arrested Deputy Holritch Rivette on lewd battery on a child age 12 to 14 charges over the weekend. Once our agency was aware of OCSO's investigation, Rivette was immediately put on administrative leave. He was terminated once we learned of his arrest, he was actually served with termination papers during his booking process.

'He was on probationary status with us, as he started on 09/30/2014 as a Deputy Sheriff. He was still in training.'

An OSCO incident report obtained by Daily Mail Online said the girl told investigators the abuse lasted 'from the time she was thirteen years old to fourteen years old.' 

According to the incident report, she told authorities the most recent incident took place March 2014.

The report said the girl told authorities 'he would offer to buy her clothing in exchange for sex.' 

WESH reported that Rivette is out on bond and denied the sexual contact in court documents.

On his Facebook profile, Rivette has written in multiple photo captions that he served in the Marine Corps. 

Rivette did not return a request for comment and his Facebook account appeared to have been taken down on Wednesday.
