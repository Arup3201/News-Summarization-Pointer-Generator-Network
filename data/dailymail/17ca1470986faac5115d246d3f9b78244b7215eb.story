America's top intelligence official is predicting that Vladimir Putin plans to seize the strategic Ukrainian port of Mariupol in spring.

Such a move by pro-Moscow rebels backed by the Russian army would be a key step in creating a land bridge and supply route to annexed Crimea.

It would amount to a huge escalation in the conflict in eastern Ukraine.

'It is not our assessment that he is bent on capturing or conquering all of Ukraine,' said James Clapper, US Director of National Intelligence.

'He wants a whole entity composed of the two oblasts (regions) in eastern Ukraine which would include a land bridge to Crimea and perhaps a port, specifically Mariupol.

'We do not believe that an attack on Mariupol is imminent. I believe they will wait until the spring before they attack.'

Ahead of a ceasefire, which has led to a lull in fighting in recent days, there were acute fears that pro-Moscow rebels were preparing an assault on Mariupol, a Sea of Azov port.

Rebels were now 'reconstituting and regrouping', he warned.

Moscow has struggled to supply Crimea from mainland Russia since annexing the Black Sea peninsula a year ago.

For now, land transport depends on the use of ferry services across the Kerch Strait.

A seizure of Mariupol would represent a huge defeat for Ukraine and its backers in the West who want to stall Putin's alleged land grab strategy.

The US spy chief made clear he favoured supplying arms to Kiev to counter Russian expansionism.

This was his 'personal view' and not necessarily the position of US intelligence agencies, but he acknowledged that such a move could upset Putin and encourage him to give more powerful weapons to rebels.

The head of military intelligence, Lieutenant General Vincent Stewart, appeared to disagree with him, telling the same US Senate hearing that the Rusisans 'will up the ante if we do any lethal aid or take any actions to bolster the equation'.

President Barack Obama is weighing the idea of arming Ukraine but has yet to announce a final decision.
