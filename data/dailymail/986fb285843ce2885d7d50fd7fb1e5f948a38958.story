Jose Mourinho claims he does not want to sign or sell anyone in January and preserve the happy equilibrium which has helped Chelsea storm clear at the top of the Barclays Premier League.

'For me that is the perfect situation,' said Mourinho. 'I don't want people to leave. I don't want people to come in. We started our project this way, and I'd like to go until the end.

'If other teams do it in January, good for them. No problem for me. It will not be something I will use, saying: 'These guys spend £30million more'.

Jose Mourinho has said that Chelsea will not buy or sell any players in the January transfer window

There had been rumours that Petr Cech could leave the club but that now appears unlikely

'They can spend what they want and what they can. Hopefully everything goes okay and we have no emergency needs for January.'

The Chelsea boss said something very similar last year only to have a busy month when the January transfer window opened with Juan Mata and Kevin de Bruyne leaving the club and Nemanja Matic and Kurt Zouma signing.

The difference, however, is that his team are clear at the top of the Barclays Premier League and unbeaten in 19 games as they travel to Sunderland.

When the market opens at the end of December, the onus will be on others to improve to catch the leaders.

Mourinho's Chelsea side are six points clear at the top of the Barclays Premier League table

Mourinho said he was happy with his summer signings and didn't want to change his squad at all

'It will take some other clubs winning every match,' said Mourinho when asked what it will take to lose the title from this position, six points clear after 12 games. 'Not every match, but win-win-win-win-win-win-win. With my team, I don't believe in bad periods.

'I believe in defeat. I believe there are many difficult matches ahead, with so many points to lose. But I don't believe in bad moments. The team is a good team, a solid team. The players know what they want and how to reach it.

'They have changed. There was an evolution in these young people, a clear evolution. I don't think the group, as a group, can be complacent. That's the only risk we don't have because it's not the profile of this group.'
