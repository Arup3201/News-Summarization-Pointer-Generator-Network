A 31-year-old man has spoken of his attraction for women several decades older than he is - and how he hasn't dated anyone under 60 in the past five years. 

Kyle Jones, of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, also reveals that his oldest girlfriend was 91 as he shares his story on tonight's episode of TLC's My Strange Addiction.

'I love everything about older women. I love the smell, I love the feel, I love the mentality,' he says enthusiastically in a preview of the show.

Unusual type: Kyle Jones, 31, admits that he's only attracted to women several decades older than he is on tonight's episode of My Strange Addiction; he's also seen going on a first date with a woman named Karen (pictured)

Up close and personal: Kyle and Karen, who met online, share a steamy kiss during their first date

He adds: 'I love dentures. Women can be self-conscious about dentures. Ladies, I promise you, telling your man that you have dentures will not turn him off. 

'It'll put a smile on his face. It'll put a smile on his pants.'

Kyle points out that there are a myriad of terms for sexy older women, such as 'milf' and 'cougar'. But the one he prefers is 'silver fox', because he finds platinum hair a huge turn-on.

He first became aware of his penchant for older women when he was in sixth grade. 

'There was a really sexy teacher, and she was probably about 65. She had the platinum hair, she was top heavy and she was just gorgeous,' he recalls.

First impression: 'She absolutely has the look that I'm attracted to. She has the platinum hair, she has a great smile,' Kyle says upon seeing Karen

Great date: 'You looked great online, but you look incredible in person,' Kyle tells Karen over dinner

By the time he was 18, he was dating a 50-year-old.

Kyle is seen emailing a woman named Karen who catches his eye on a dating site, and proclaims her 'gorgeous'.

'She absolutely has the look that I'm attracted to. She has the platinum hair, she has a great smile. She looks very pretty and very adventurous,' he observes.

Kyle and Karen meet for dinner at a restaurant and he immediately deems her 'sexy as hell'.

'You looked great online, but you look incredible in person,' he tells her. 

Positive review: 'The date with Karen was incredible. She was 100per cent my type,' Kyle says afterward

Mutual appreciation: Karen also says she had a 'wonderful time' on her date with Kyle

When Kyle asks why Karen agreed to meet him, she says: 'I look at all of these celebrity women that are going out with younger men and I thought maybe I should try it.'

She adds: 'You seem to be intelligent - though I'm not going to say I necessarily agreed to come out with you because of your mind.'

Karen admits that she is nervous because Kyle is so much younger, but she's excited to have a 'brand new' experience. 

When she notes that she's old enough to be Kyle's mother - or even grandmother - he assures her: 'You're pretty enough to take home though.'

Dating history: Kyle, seen with a former girlfriend, first became aware of his penchant for older women when he was in sixth grade

The pair head back to Kyle's place, where they dance with each other and even share a steamy kiss. 

'The date with Karen was incredible. She was 100per cent my type,' Kyle says afterward. Karen also says she had a 'wonderful time' with Kyle. 

Tonight's episode of My Strange Addiction also features a 30-year-old man named Adam, who has spent more than $175,000 on cosmetic procedures and costumes in order to look more like Madonna. 

Adam started his transformation into the Material Girl more than a dozen years ago.

Age is just a number: Kyle's oldest girlfriend was 91-year-old Marjorie McCool (pictured), whom he was in a casual relationship with as of last June

'Looking like Madonna is not easy,' he insists. 'I try to emulate each look of hers. I go down to the hair, the clothing, the stitching, the jewelry.'

He has already spent about $100,000 on costumes alone, including pieces Madonna wore during her famed Blonde Ambition tour in 1990.

'It started when I was 15. I remember going through my mom's music collection and I came across her first album. I listened to it and fell in love with it. It spoke to my soul,' he says.

His mother, Annette, adds: He would defend Madonna constantly, like if she was a girlfriend or a boyfriend, and I couldn't understand his love.'

When Adam shows up dressed in drag while Annette has friends over, she is forced to explain her son's bizarre obsession to her guests.

'This addiction to Madonna strains our relationship,' she reveals. 'He doesn't know when to draw the line.'

My Strange Addiction airs tonight at 10pm on TLC.
