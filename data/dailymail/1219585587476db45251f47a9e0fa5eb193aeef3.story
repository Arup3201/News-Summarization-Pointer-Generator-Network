An Adelaide court has heard how a man had 'turmoil in his life' and was 'off the rails' when he punched and nearly killed Jason Lindsley in a city nightclub.

The district court was shown shocking vision of CCTV footage, from the night of the incident at Adelaide nightclub Zhivago in August 2012, where Ali Joubouri threw a single punch at the victim, which saw him instantly drop to the ground.

The footage shows Mr Lindsley, then 24, talking and drinking with friends when he is seen starting to talk to Joubouri, who leaves and then comes back before having a close discussion with Mr Lindsley.

Within seconds, Joubouri is seen stepping back and punching Mr Lindlsey in the face before he slumps to the ground and his friends crowd around him.

In other angles from CCTV footage, security guards are seen rushing to where he was lying before they escort Joubouri out of the venue. 

The Advertiser reported Joubouri's lawyers blamed the attack on a racial slur, it is believed their client heard before he threw the punch and referred to him as 'over-sensitive' due to an attack months earlier where he was stabbed.

Already in custody for 18 months, his lawyers also asked for his release so he could 'continue his rehabilitation'.

But the court was urged not to hear his excuses, as prosecutor Kos Lesses argued Joubouri was on bail, banned from the CBD and in breach of curfew.

Joubouri, 22, from Walkley Heights initially pleaded not guilty to charges, just last month he pleaded guilty to recklessly causing serious harm to Mr Lindsley who was in a coma for a fortnight and needed several surgeries after suffering a serious brain injury.

It took Mr Lindsley 10 months of recovery and rehabilitation before he could return to work full-time.

Another one of Joubouri's lawyers, Jon Lister, said his client  was suffering from post traumatic stress, The Advertiser reported.

'There was turmoil in his life, he was off the rails because of the fallout from his terrifying ordeal when he himself was nearly killed,' he said.

In a letter of apology addressed to Mr Lindsley's parents, Joubouri said he was 'deeply sorry' for the pain he had caused the family as a result of that 'terrible night'.

'I have written this letter over and over again for the past year but I have been too embarrassed and ashamed to send it,' he said.

'I have finally had the power within myself to send it and more importantly I thought your family would like some closure.'

While claiming his letter wasn't to 'look for sympathy' or to 'justify' his actions he wanted to explain his difficulty growing up and being the victim of a vicious assault himself.

'I hope you will accept my apology and forgive me for what I have put your family through and I apologise to your son for all the pain and suffering I have put him through,' he said. 

Joubouri also wrote a letter to the judge detailing his tough upbringing and how sorry he was for his actions.

'I have learnt a lot of life lessons and grown more mature in my time in prison,' he said.

'Hope you will find mercy within yourself to give me a second chance.'

Joubouri has been remanded in custody for sentencing next month.

Mr Lindsley's father, Doug, told The Advertiser outside court there was no justification for his violent behaviour.  

'Let’s hope justice comes forward, and that (the sentence) shows a lot of people you can’t do this and get away with it,' he said.
