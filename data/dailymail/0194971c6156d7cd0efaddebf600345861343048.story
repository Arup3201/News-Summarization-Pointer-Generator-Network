An ax wielding teen was left crying for his mother when he tried to rob a convenience store and came away with a face full of mace.  

Store clerk Ali Ait Mahdi recounted the violent confrontation to Oklahoma City reporters.

'When I saw the ax, I said, 'You need to leave before I shoot you,' he said.

But suspect Giovanni Davenport as blasted with pepper spray when he tried to use an ax to rob a convenience store

Store clerk Ali Ait Mahdi said he reacted to a life threatening situation

But suspect Giovanni Davenport didn't heed the warning, instead swinging the ax into the store's counter. 

Ali began to blast pepper spray into the boy's face. 

'I really sprayed him in the eyes very well,' Ali told KFOR. 'That’s when he lost control and started running toward the door.'

By the time he got outside, Davenport was 'crying… throwing up… and calling for his momma,' according to the police report. 

Ali was not softened by the reaction. 

'I heard that he was crying for his mom, but you know we all have parents and we all have problems, but some of us wake up at 6 a.m. to go to work, and some of us wake up at 1 in the afternoon to rob somebody else. That’s life,' he said. 

Two FBI agents happened to be at the scene and witness the attempted robbery

Even more bad news for Davenport, he stumbled out right into two FBI agents who'd seen the attempted robbery. 

Ali followed Davenport out to see an FBI agent pointing a gun at the wannabe robber. 

Authorities say the best practice is not to fight back during a robbery, as it's lucky only the counter was cut.

'The bottom line is we’re thankful he was not hurt,' said Oklahoma City police Sgt. Jennifer Wardlow. 'We always encourage victims to comply. We want to see them get out alive.'

Davenport was taken to jail and charged with robbery and assault with a dangerous weapon. 

'Situations like that, you fight for yourself for your life,' Ali said. 'It’s instinct.'
