A set of candid photographs featuring George Harrison, John Lennon and Yoko Ono ahead of the Concert for Bangladesh have emerged for sale and are expected to sell for thousands at auction.

In the photographs, the former Beatles appear to be on good terms despite the Fab Four splitting up a year before the landmark benefit gig in 1971.

Sotheby's are placing the set of photographs, soon to be exhibited in New York, under the hammer at the A Rock N Roll History: From Presley to Punk auction on June 24.

The photographs show Lennon smiling and joking around and Yoko Ono engaged in conversation with a frosty looking Harrison.

The late Harrison asked all his former bandmates to perform and it would have been the first time the group would have appeared on stage together in the U.S. since 1966.

Drummer Ringo Starr and Lennon agreed but McCartney refused due to a rift over the legal problems the Beatles split had caused.

But just days before the Concert for 
Bangladesh at Madison Square Garden in New York Harrison and Lennon's 
friendship waned because of a row over Yoko Ono performing on the bill 
with Lennon.

Lennon, who
 was shot dead in New York by deranged fan Mark Chapman in 1980, 
accepted Harrison’s demand that Yoko Ono was not allowed to perform.

But Lennon and Ono had an argument days before the gig and Lennon left New York so he did not appear on stage.

It is believed the photographs were taken during rehearsals for the concert, which featured an all-star line-up including Bob Dylan, Eric Clapton and Badfinger.

John Lennon, seen clowning around for the camera ahead of the gig, was shot dead by deranged fan Mark Chapman in 1980 

Concert for Bangladesh was organised by Harrison after his friend and mentor Ravi Shankar asked him to help raise money for the poverty-stricken country.

It is estimated that Harrison’s brainchild raised around $12million for UNICEF in total and 40,000 people attended the live show.
