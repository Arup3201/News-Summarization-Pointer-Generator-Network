Expensive: The police investigation into the Jimmy Savile, pictured, 
abuse scandal has cost around £2 million

The police investigation into the Jimmy Savile abuse scandal has cost around £2 million so far, the Metropolitan Police Commissioner said today.

Bernard Hogan-Howe gave a committee of MPs an estimated cost for Operation Yewtree, which involves a team of 30 officers.

Scotland Yard is leading a national probe into alleged abuse by disgraced TV presenter Savile, as well as claims made against other figures in the entertainment industry.

Earlier this month the force said it was dealing with around 450 potential victims, the vast majority of whom claimed they had fallen prey to Savile.

Officers are looking at three strands within their inquiry: claims against Savile, those against Savile and others, and those against others.

Most of the 'others' allegations have been made against people associated with the entertainment industry.

So far Gary Glitter, comedian Freddie Starr, DJ Dave Lee Travis and a man in his 70s, reported to be former television producer Wilfred De’Ath, have been arrested and bailed as part of the probe.

Mr Hogan-Howe addressed the Commons Home Affairs Committee as his force is facing more than £500million in cuts.

The Met is selling New Scotland Yard as part of the plans, and will see the loss of 1,200 officers ranked sergeant or above, as well as around 3,500 members of civilian of staff.

The size of the bill was exposed as BBC Trust chairman Lord Patten also gave evidence to MPs that raised fresh concerns about the overall cost of the scandal.

Lord Patten revealed that former BBC director general George Entwistle asked for even more than the controversial £450,000 pay-off when he left the corporation over two abuse crises.

He told MPs that Mr Entwistle wanted more than 12 months' salary to resign - despite being contractually entitled to only half that amount.

Appearing before the Commons Culture, Media and Sport Committee, Lord Patten insisted today the settlement was "better than any other course of action" amid fears of an unfair dismissal claim.

Mr Entwistle was finally forced to quit after just 54 days in the job after BBC2's Newsnight wrongly implicated Lord McAlpine in a child abuse scandal - leading to a £185,000 payout.

He had already faced heavy criticism over the corporation's response to the Jimmy Savile abuse scandal, including his own decision to run tribute programmes to the late DJ last Christmas even though he knew he was the subject of an earlier Newsnight investigation.

The Pollard Review, examining the shelved Newsnight report into Savile's abuse, is expected to be completed by Christmas, but a second review led by Dame Janet Smith, looking at the culture and practices of the BBC during the years the star worked there, could take much longer.

Lord Patten said it was impossible to predict how much they would cost but said they would clearly be expensive, 'partly because of the number of lawyers involved'.

The MPs was told that about 40 staff are being investigated over the Savile decision in initial interviews but not all have legal support, which is being capped at up to £50,000.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
