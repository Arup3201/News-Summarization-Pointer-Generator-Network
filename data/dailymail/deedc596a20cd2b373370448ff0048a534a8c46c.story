She has designed gorgeous wedding gowns for the likes of Mariah Carey, Victoria Beckham and Kim Kardashian, so it is fair to say that Vera Wang's creations are in hot demand.

But the famed designer found herself in a race row after news emerged that in one part of the world she was charging brides for trying on her dresses.

The 63-year-old was charging brides-to-be a 
non-refundable fee of 3,000 yuan (£318) to try on gowns for only 90
minutes at her 
two-story, 850 square meter flagship in the heart of Shanghai.

Now, following a Twitter storm of complaints, Wang has stopped appointment fees at all of the label's international bridal stores.

Speaking about the imposed changes, 
Vera Wang told WWD: 'Upon careful investigation and review of the 
policies of our international operators, we will be abolishing 
appointment fees in all of our stores.

'We wish for all Vera Wang customers 
to enjoy the same standard of excellence worldwide. Treating our 
customers in a fair and equitable way remains a priority.

'The store in Shanghai has only been 
open to private VIP preview appointments. The official opening to the 
public will take place on April 29.'

In spite of the steep fee, the store had seen a huge amount of visitors, with brides booking months in advance to try on dresses.

Famous fans: Kim Kardashian, a family friend of the designer, and Mariah Carey both wore Vera's designs on their big days

With 10 million Chinese couples marrying every year in a country where the wedding industry is said to be worth £8.5 billion, Ms. Wang looked set to make a hefty profit from overzealous brides desperate to snap up her designs.

But local press slammed the designer, especially as Wang is herself a first generation Chinese American, who's parents were born in Shanghai.

And it isn't just Vera Wang who was imposing these hefty fees in China.

Omega watches charges customers three times as much for their wrist candy in China than in their Milan store and also charges for a replacement service, which is free in Europe.

Much coveted: Her designs, as worn by Keira Knightley, Michelle Williams and Rachel Weisz, caused a frenzy in China- despite the hefty fee

Vera Wang worked at U.S. Vogue for 16 years as a senior fashion editor before leaving and setting up her bridal design company.

She
left Vogue after she was overlooked for the editor-in-chief position, 
currently held by Anna Wintour, and went to work at Ralph Lauren, where 
she stayed on as design director for two years.

In 1990 she opened a bridal salon in New York's Carlyle hotel where her dresses continue to be sold today.
