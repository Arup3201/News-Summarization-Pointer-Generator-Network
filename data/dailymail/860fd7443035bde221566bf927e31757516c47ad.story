British cricket helmet manufacturer Masuri have designed a clip-on application to provide extra protection for batsmen in a bid to prevent a repeat of the tragic death of Australian Phillip Hughes last year.

Hughes, 25, was killed last November when a bouncer from fast bowler Sean Abbott struck him on the neck, dissecting his vertebral artery and causing a brain haemorrhage. Masuri’s new product is designed to protect the vulnerable area from such impacts.

The ‘StemGuard’, a device made from plastic and dense foam, will clip on to the back of existing Masuri Vision helmets.

The foam – which is military specification – is similar to that between the layers of a helmet shell, and is the key component in reducing the impact of high-speed deliveries directed at the neck.

The idea behind the arrangement of the foam and plastic – in a honeycomb shape – is to afford the batsman manoeuvrability while still providing as much protection as the shell of the helmet.

Hampshire-based Masuri - whose helmets were worn by England players Moeen Ali, Gary Ballance, Eoin Morgan, Ravi Bopara, Jos Buttler, Chris Jordan, Stuart Broad and James Tredwell against Pakistan yesterday – tested the StemGuard at Loughborough University using the same ball-firing equipment and measuring apparatus used to test helmet peaks. 

Former professionals and the cricket boards of England, India and Australia have also been involved with the design, consultation and testing process. The StemGuard is patent pending, meaning the UK Patent Office have accepted there is no similar product on the market, and Masuri can go ahead with manufacturing and selling it
