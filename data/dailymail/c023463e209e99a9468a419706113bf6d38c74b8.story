An elderly woman is in a critical condition in hospital after she was knocked to the ground and mugged by two youngsters as she left a supermarket.

The 82-year-old, who walks with the aid of a stick, was attacked as she left Morrisons in Palmers Green in Enfield, north London yesterday.

The pensioner was knocked to the ground, in broad daylight and the pair stole her purse.

She was also left with head injuries and serious bruising to her face.

An air ambulance had to be called and she is now in a stable but critical condition in a central London hospital.

The Metropolitan Police are now appealing for witnesses saying the two male youths involved are believed to be in their late teens or early 20s. 

Detective Constable Ryan Clark from Enfield CID said: 'This was a callous attack on a vulnerable member of the community who was out in the middle of the day shopping for groceries.
