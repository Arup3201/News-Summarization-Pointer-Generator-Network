A teenager who pulled out so much of her hair she was left nearly bald has shaved her head in an effort to tackle her condition.

Eden Cahill, 15 from County Antrim, Northern Ireland, suffers from trichotillomania.

The condition means she is compelled to pull out her hair, eyelashes and eyebrows – something she has done since she was six years old.

By the time she was a teenager, Eden had hardly any hair at the top and the sides of her face, only a layer of hair at the base of her neck.

However, in a bid to battle trichotillomania, she has recently shaved off her hair and set up her own YouTube channel to document her journey.

Eden Cahill, 15, shaved off her head in order to tackle trichotillomania - a condition that compelled her to pull out her hair, eyebrows and eyelashes

Eden started pulling out her hair at age six as it brought her a sense of relief (she is pictured left before she started pulling). By the time she was a teenager she was almost bald (right)

Eden said: 'I remember the moment I started to pull my hair out. I was at my grandma's watching television and I felt an odd hair.

'I pulled it out and it felt right so I carried on pulling a lot more after that.

'The day I shaved my hair I felt a major release, I felt so much better about everything and my head felt free.'

Trichotillomania is an impulse-control disorder - a condition where a person is unable to stop themselves carrying out a particular action.

Some experts think hair pulling is a type of addiction, while others believe it may be a way of relieving stress and anxiety. 

By her teenage years, Eden was bald all bar some hair at the side and back of her head. 

This led people to ask if she had chemotherapy, or alopecia, comments she says were upsetting.

At school, she wore a headband 24 hours a day to hide her baldness, and clipped hair extensions on to her remaining hair.

Trichotillomania is a condition where a person feels compelled to pull their hair out.

They may pull out the hair on their head or in other places, such as their eyebrows or eyelashes.

Trichotillomania is an impulse-control disorder - a psychological condition where you are unable to stop yourself carrying out a particular action.

It is not known what causes trichotillomania but there are several theories.

Some experts think hair pulling is a type of addiction. The more you pull your hair out, the more you want to keep doing it.

Trichotillomania may be a reflection of a mental health problem. 

Psychological and behavioural theories suggest that hair pulling may be a way of relieving stress or anxiety.

In some cases, trichotillomania may be a form of self-harm, where you deliberately injure yourself as a way of seeking temporary relief from emotional distress.

The most effective treatment is therapy to change your hair-pulling behaviour, combined with a network of emotional support.

Now, she has spoken out about her trichotillomania to help people realise the condition exists and has set up a Facebook group and YouTube channel to help raise awareness.

She says she is inspired by TOWIE star Samantha Faiers who has previously spoken out about her trichotillomania. 

She said: 'I was so embarrassed of how I looked and I was scared to hear what people thought of my hair so I wore a thick headband over my hair to try and cover it.

'I never took the band off, not even when our class went swimming but when Sam from TOWIE spoke about trichotillomania it inspired me and more people at school understood what I had.'

Eden's Facebook group, 'Trichotillomania & Me' and her YouTube channel have amassed hundreds of views and comments supporting Eden's bid to raise awareness.

Speaking in her first video post, she said her auntie convinced her to start the blog as a way of describing her illness and explaining it to others.

She said: 'I wasn't sure I was going to do it because I didn't want to be judged.

'But at the end of the day who cares what people think of you because you are who you are for a reason.

'I am what I am and I am trichotillomania.'

She described how trichotillomania affects her confidence.

She said: 'You know people are looking at you while you pull your hair out.

'It's embarrassing to see all of your hair all over your school work.

'It lowers your self-esteem, makes you feel crap all the time. I see other people looking great in their photos and it makes me feel down in their dumps.

'I go through really bad spots.'

On 31st January Eden decided to shave her entire head to stop her pulling out her remaining hair, in an effort to beat her condition.

Eden decided to shave off her hair on 31st January this year, as she hoped this would stop her pulling out her hair and help her beat the condition once and for all 

Throughout her teenage years, Eden wore a thick band (pictured left and right), even when swimming, as she was embarrassed people would see her bald head

Eden's family are supportive of her video blogging, saying she is an 'inspiration'. She is pictured (from left to right) with father David, sister Abbie and brother David

In a blog post before the hair cut, she explained: 'I’m still able to pull it and I don’t want it to be a length at which I can pull it.

'I’m really excited and nervous to get it done.I know people will support my decision. Once I get it done I’ll be more comfortable and confident.' 

She hopes continuing the video blog will help others understand the daily struggles of someone living with trichotillomania. 

Eden's mother Louise, 43 has been a constant support to her daughter and admits they have both learned a lot about trichotillomania.

Mrs Cahill said: 'When we found out about Eden's trichotillomania I messaged loads of people and pages to try and understand her condition.

'We have both learned so much and when Eden decided to shave her hair I've never been prouder.

'She's an inspiration to us all.'
