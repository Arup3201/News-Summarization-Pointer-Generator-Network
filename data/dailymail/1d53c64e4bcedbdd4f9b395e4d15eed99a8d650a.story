Hannah Delmonte is already Prom Queen -  even though the big event isn't until May.

The Virginia girl, a Philadelphia Eagles fan since birth, started a Twitter campaign to have her favorite player, linebacker Emmanuel Acho, be her date for the big night, figuring she'd 'give it a shot'.

The 16-year-year-old sent the NFL player a direct message on Instagram, asking whether he would take her to her junior prom if she got 2,000 retweets. Acho replied within an hour.

'I raised the bar and I said, ''If you get 10,000, you got a deal'',' he later told ABC News.

'No way!' An overwhelmed Hannah Delmonte, 16, cries with shock as Philadelphia Eagles linebacker Emmanual Acho, 24, arrives at her school in Pucelville, Virginia, last week

Date night: After a social media campaign went her way, Delmonte is now going to her junior prom with Acho, who had a special Eagles jersey made up for his date

Miss Delmonte amassed 15,000 retweets in three hours.

'After that, I said, ''Ok, I'm going to prom and how can I make this an extremely special event for her?'' Acho said.

So last Friday, 24-year-old Acho traveled from the University of Texas at Austin - where attends graduate school when he's not playing for the Eagles - to Woodgrove High School in Purcellville, Virginia, where Delmonte attends.

'I saw him and at first it didn't register all the way,' Hannah told ABC. 'Then I realized it was him. 

I was shocked and overwhelmed. He didn't know what to say at first because I was crying, but he actually did say, ''Will you go to prom with me?''

And in case Delmonte didn't know why he was there, Acho was armed with a specially-made Eagles jersey that said 'PROM' on the back.

Shock: Acho was just as surprised to see the student amass so many retweets in such a short time

After dealing with the shock, Delmonte is now madly searching for a dress in the signature Eagles shade of green. 

Acho, of course, will be in a tuxedo with a green bow tie for the May 9 prom.

He is also trying to think of ways to make the night even more special.

'I am trying to figure out where to buy a corsage,' he told ABC, laughing. 'I've gotten offers from different car services but, yeah, I also play a little piano and sing. 

'We'll see if I have a special musical performance.' 

The gesture also seems to have had as much of an affect on Acho as it has on Delmonte. 

'Saying it was humbling is so cliché,' Acho said. 

'It's a very heartwarming feeling because I never realize the impact I have on other people until that moment. When I saw her cry, I truly realized that I play a big impact on people's lives.'
