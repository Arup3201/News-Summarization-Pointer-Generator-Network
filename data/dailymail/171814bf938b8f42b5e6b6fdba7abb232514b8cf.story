The World Cup is just 16 days away and excitement is building. Each week our man in Brazil, Joe Callaghan, brings us the latest news and views from South America - as well as traveller tips for those heading out there - and provides a flavour of exactly how the World Cup in Brazil is shaping up.

'Yes, [money] is one of the reasons. I'm 59 and I don't want to work as a coach until I'm 70. I want to retire in four or five years.'

Those words were uttered in June 2008, which, assuming our maths are right here, means Luis Felipe Scolari never got his wish. Four and five years have come and gone, a sixth is well upon him and the now 65-year-old is about as far removed from the peace and tranquility of retirement as he could ever have imagined.

The lush green of Granja Comary in the hillside surrounds of Teresopolis, ironically, can be a very serene place when it wants to be.

Relaxed: Brazil boss Luiz Felipe Scolari was in relaxed mood when he greeted journalists at their training base

Warm greeting: Scolari give Dani Alves a warm welcome to the Brazil training centre ahead of the World Cup

Whether it wanted or not, yesterday was certainly not one of those days as Brazil's World Cup squad made the short trek up from Rio de Janeiro and picked their way through a pack of protesters, throngs of fans and an army of national and international media. In the middle of it all stood Scolari, the flame to which these myriad moths were drawn.

Brazil's first day in World Cup camp is a pretty big deal every four years but this time round they take on the world on home turf with 200 million pairs of eyes staring down on them in heavy hope and enormous expectation.

But Big Phil cut a comfortable figure, one who is exactly where he wants to be. Retirement? You've got to be kidding.

To be fair, buying the winnebago and 
seeing a bit more of the world with his wife Olga weren't the only 
things that didn't go to the plan Scolari laid out back in June 2008. 
Those comments were made at a press conference that came in the middle 
of Euro 2008 when the 2002 World Cup winner was confirmed as Avram 
Grant's replacement as Chelsea manager.

High hopes: Scolari greets Brazil's biggest talent Neymar to their World Cup training base this week

Objection: A handful of protestors also met the players, upset at the sums of money spent on the World Cup

He didn't take up the role and that lucrative three-year deal until a month later but it was all over within another seven months. It was a short spell marked with a long list of failings. Signings, Deco the prime example, never quite clicked, there were fallings out with senior players and tactical breakdowns aplenty.

But more than anything, succeeding two men - Grant and Jose Mourinho - who had been unbeaten at home and going on to drop 16 of 39 points at Stamford Bridge did it for Scolari.

It was an episode that scarred 
Felipao, not just big in nickname but in character and confidence too. 
Being viewed as unable to cut it in the Premier League cut him deep. 
After all, this is a man who has been at the helm in three major 
tournaments that also featured England.

He
 knocked them out of all three - the 2002 and 2006 World Cups and Euro 
2004 in between - before being denied the opportunity to continue the 
streak when the Three Lions failed to qualify for Euro 2008. Never mind 
Germany or Argentina, Scolari is the new Old Enemy.

Hard times: Scolari is still hurt by the memories of failing to succeed during his time as Chelsea manager

So there is no little irony that here he is now, 12 months past the appointed retirement date eyeing history and relying heavily on sources of that painful experience.

Bidding to become only the second man 
in history - and the first since 1938 - to win two World Cups as 
manager, Scolari is leaning on the league which burned him so badly, 
taking six Premier League players home for action and summoning four of 
his 23 from Chelsea.

As
 for Mourinho, the old foe whose shadow he couldn't escape at the Bridge
 and who he fell out with more than once when he was Portugal coach and 
the upstart was working his early magic at Porto, Scolari has a lot to 
thank him for.

Benefactor: Scolari has benefited from Jose Mourinho's (right) improving of Willian and Oscar at Chelsea

In deconstructing and casting afresh Willian into the relentless, all action talent he became this past season, while also tinkering and finessing the approach of Oscar, there is a mark of Mourinho in Big Phil's retooled Selecao, unlikely as Scolari is to ever acknowledge it.

However, he has mellowed, he has changed. At Granja Comary he welcomed his squad almost like a father or at the very least close family. There was little of the past headmaster, more jolly uncle. New traits have blended easily though with the old reliables - most crucially, loyalty. Scolari will largely stick with his tried and trusted Confederations Cup winners in the bid for home glory.

There has been some trademark luck too, not a single major injury in the build-up, while opening night opponents Croatia will have their leader of the line Mario Mandzukic suspended.

They are the kind of early breaks that can shape a path to glory, that can at the very least help build confidence. 'In Brazil we only have one option,' said Scolari earlier this month. 'Winning.'Retirement can sure as hell wait.

High hopes: Scolari says the Brazilian public only has one outcome in its mind for the World Cup: winning

David Luiz's huge-money swapping of London for Paris has kicked off a financial frenzy involving Brazilian defensive talent.

Dani Alves looks certain to join the former Chelsea man at PSG with Marquinhos going in the opposite direction to Barcelona.

Meanwhile, not be left out, Marcelo picked up a win and goal-scoring bonus in the Champions League final. We guess the drinks are on the defenders at Brazil camp.

Brazil does music as well as it does football. Pretty damn good in other words.

It's little surprise then that the host nation have proved harsh judges of the official song of the World Cup. Brazil's assessment of We Are One has been withering on a Cowell-esque scale. Rightly so, the ditty trundled out by Pitbull, Jennifer Lopez and native daughter Claudia Leitte is truly awful and about as Brazilian as a stadium finished on time.

Its stock is so low that the locals would be happy enough to just rehash an old tune with #VoltaWakaWaka becoming a trending hashtag here in the hope that Shakira's anthem for South Africa 2010 can be brought back in place of J-Lo and Co.

Brazil is 'One' alright, united in turning the volume down.

Some Brazilian imports came and made the Premier League their own (Juninho, Gilberto Silva), some didn't quite (Mario Jardel and Afonso Alves at the head of that queue).

Juliano Belletti falls somewhere between the two but that's not say there weren't spectacular moments during his three seasons at Stamford Bridge.

The World Cup winning full-back scored some screamers in his time at Chelsea's and came to mind this week after Marcelo bundled in Real Madrid's third against Atlético in the Champions League final.

The last Brazilian to score on European football's biggest night was none other than Belletti, who broke Arsenal hearts with the winner in the 2006 decider. Three years retired, he works as an analyst for SporTV in his homeland.

'We believe we are heading in the right direction. We have two more games in Brazil and all these games are designed for us to be ready for the first game against Chile.'

The Socceroos will be the first team to arrive in Brazil when they get here on Wednesday, a full 11 days before England.

Dropped into a group with Spain and Holland, as well as Chile, they probably should make the most of their pre-tournament time. They're unlikely to hang around too long after kick-off.

FIFA released their stadium food and drink prices yesterday and while fans jetting in from Europe or Australia may be pleasantly surprised to find that, by home standards, they'll be far from fleeced once inside any of the 12 host arenas, the same can't be said for locals.

Being asked to shell out R$6 (£1.60) for a small local beer (a large is £2.70, a large Budweiser £3.50) is hardly going to burst many budgets but being asked for R$6 for a 500ml water when any corner store in Brazil sells 1.5litre bottles for less than a quarter of the FIFA price smacks of good old-fashioned opportunism.

Maybe just get plenty of H2O onboard before coming through the turnstiles.

Big prices: The Brazilian public has reacted badly to FIFA's high prices for food and drink inside stadiums

June rolls around this weekend which means only one thing in the world's biggest rainforest - winter is here. But don't wheel out the gloves and snoods just yet because the relentless heat is not ready to give way in Manaus.

Highs of 30C will persist all week with lows (English fans might feel 'slightly less highs' is a better term) of 23C.

Consider this, stadium volunteers plucked from the local community complained of feeling ill after training runs in the heat in recent days. If that's the toll it is taking on the locals, blow-ins may be better off staying indoors.
