She has wowed the X Factor judges with her incredible voice and unconventional style but according to Chloe-Jasmine Whichello, 23, the latter has come at a price.

The X Factor finalist is to appear in a new Channel 5 documentary in which she confesses to being a shopaholic and to running up huge bills in order to amass her designer wardrobe.

Chloe-Jasmine, whose jazz version of Britney Spears' Toxic on Saturday night, was enough to see her through the first round of the X Factor, says she could quite happily shop all day and spends 80 per cent of her income on clothes.

Passion for spending: X Factor finalist Chloe-Jasmine Whichello has confessed to being a shopaholic

So marked is her obsession with fashion, her London flat overflows with items that are yet to see the light of day - as does her parents' Somerset home.

'I absolutely adore shopping,' explains the X Factor finalist. 'I’ve really developed a taste for style and an appreciation of fine tailoring and materials.

'In a dream world, I would shop at Christian Dior, Yves Saint Laurent, Chanel, Givenchy. I love J Mendel, and anything from the Harrods international designer showroom is insanity.

'I love pieces that are works of art, that are beautifully crafted, that are bespoke, that are gorgeous, like pieces of music almost.'

The would-be singer, who claims that being on the X Factor is 'my dream', also spoke of her love for modelling, waxing lyrical about getting to dress up for a living and meet big name designers.

Plenty to choose from: Chloe-Jasmine has so many clothes, her London flat is practically 'overflowing'

'As a model, I am so surrounded by clothes and fashion and style, and encounter so many different outfit changes a day,' she added.

'I get such a buzz out of working as well. It’s essentially dressing up, it’s quite a cool occupation. In my job you get to meet the designers working and grafting to create this fantastic item which is so inspirational to us mere mortals.'

But her close encounter with the world of fashion has had a deleterious effect on her bank balance, with Ms Whichello admitting that she spends up to 80 per cent of her earnings on clothes. 

'Having worked in the fashion industry for about seven years or so, I've become accustomed to being surrounded by beautiful things,' she explains.

'I can be in one store looking for the perfect thing for up to two-and-a-half hours. I would say that around 80 per cent of the money I earn goes on clothes.

'The vast majority of what I do earn, it goes on clothes. I’m not going to lie about that. I mean, obviously a girl has to eat.

'But I would rather not get a cab, and walk, and put that money aside for an incredible dress. I could quite happily shop every day, it just depends on how hard I work. It’s like a motivation for me to earn money really.'

Ms Whichello has proved one of this year's most controversial X Factor contestants, with allegations of nude photos and being significantly less well-spoken than she claims dogging her footsteps.

Nevertheless, she has consistently impressed the judges, among them Simon Cowell who on Saturday said that he thought she was 'a sweet girl but ditzy'.

She has also won plaudits for her fashion choices, most recently the silver beaded flapper dress by high street brand Quiz worn for her appearance on Saturday night's show.

No surprise then, that Ms Whichello says making a big impression is all part of her act. 'You never get a second chance to make a first impression, and clothes maketh the man,' she explains.

'The feeling when you walk into a shop, and it’s just filled with this abundance of fabulous attire, is inexplicable almost. 

High hopes: Chloe-Jasmine hopes to make her singing dreams come true via her appearance on the X-Factor

'It’s like a crazy rush. And everything negative just melts away. It’s like a transportation down the rabbit-hole, you feel like Alice in this crazy wonderland.'

And despite rumours of topless photos and orgies doing the rounds, Ms Whichello says the thing that really gets her heart racing is finding a stunning (and stunningly expensive) pair of shoes.

'It gets my heart rate up,' she admits. 'It’s quite frightening. I really do believe that shopping has some kind of addictive property, it releases hormones into our bodies which we can’t get anywhere else, it’s like a certain, special type adrenalin.

'It’s quite an incredible feeling when a garment makes you feel special and unique, it’s almost like it has secret powers. I believe the minute I stop shopping, the minute I stop caring about myself.

'Some people go to the gym, some people play badminton, some people play tennis, some people run, me, I shop, it is a sporting form.'
