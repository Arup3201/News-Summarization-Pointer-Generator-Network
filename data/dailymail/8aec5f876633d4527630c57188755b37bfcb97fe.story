Barcelona are continuing to show an interest in Arsenal midfielder Aaron Ramsey.

Manager Arsene Wenger has no desire to sell and Ramsey is happy at The Emirates, where he finished the season with an FA Cup final flourish and winning goal.

Ramsey's form and age, still only 23, has played a part in Wenger's considerations over any proposed deal for Cesc Fabregas.

Bayern Munich maintain an interest in Ramsey also as they covet players to potentially replace Toni Kroos. Real Madrid are the latest side to enquire about Kroos who was destined for Manchester United.

The Germany international has one year left on contract and Chelsea have also asked about taking him on a free next summer.
