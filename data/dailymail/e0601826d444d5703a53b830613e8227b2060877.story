Suzanne Porter, 25, was arrested after she urinated in the street and 'exposed backside' to officers

A young mother who punched a policewoman’s teeth in after she was arrested for urinating in the street gloated about it on Facebook and posted pictures of her blood stained dress.

Suzanne Porter, 25, from Clitheroe in Lancashire, had been drinking shots on a night out with nine friends when police were called to move the rowdy group along. 

Officers were driving along when Porter, a barmaid, went out in the middle of the road and bent over before lifting up her dress and ‘exposed her backside’.

Burnley Crown Court heard that PC Kirstie Pitcher then pulled the van over and got out but Porter ran off.

The officer was able to catch up on foot and challenged her about urinating in the street, after the group were kept under CCTV observations, and exposing herself to police.

Prosecutor Joseph Allman told the court that when challenged Porter replied ‘Oh, did I?’ before PC Pitcher was joined by colleagues who decided to make an arrest.

PC Pitcher initially attempted to detain Porter before assisting in arresting her Porter’s brother, Gary Place, 29, who was also drunk and threatening officers with his sister’s stiletto shoes.

When the officer went back to arrest Porter she was punched in the face, knocking off her glasses and causing her to stagger and fall over the other detainee.

Mr Allman said: ‘It was without provocation and knocking her teeth back in her mouth so that she could feel they were dislodged.’

She was said to have felt immediate pain to her face and when she realised her teeth were loose in her mouth, she spat one out into her hand and shouted down her radio to her colleagues to arrest Porter. Porter ran off but was arrested and was found to have the victim’s blood on her white dress.

When questioned, she said she had been drinking shots after work before the incident in May.

She apologised to police but Mr Allman added: ‘She was later gloating about the incident. She posted a picture of her blood-stained dress with the comment: ”Ruined”.

PC Kirstie Pitcher had been attempting to detain Porter when she thumped her in the mouth in May this year

‘One of her Facebook associates says: “All she will want for Christmas is her two front teeth.” The defendant replied: “Ha, ha.”

‘The posting, along with another, a picture of a broken tooth, again accompanied by “ha, ha,“ added to the victim’s distress and disgust over her ordeal.’

PC Pitcher had a broken front tooth and three others were loose and also suffered distortion of the cartilage in her nose.

The prosecutor said: ‘She was off work four weeks and when she did go back, she was accompanied by a colleague because of the impact this has had on her confidence.

‘She had emergency dental treatment costing £1,300 and was on soft food for two weeks. In a number of ways, it has profoundly affected her confidence.

‘Her front teeth are discoloured and that plainly is a matter of great upset to her.’

Porter, a barmaid, posted a picture on Facebook of her blood-stained dress after the attack and wrote 'ruined'

A friend replied to Porter's Facebook post with 'All she will want for Christmas is her two front teeth', while Porter wrote back 'Ha ha' and posted a picture of a broken tooth

Porter, who had a previous conviction for violence and intimidation, admitted assault causing actual bodily harm and was sentenced to ten months in prison.

In mitigation her counsel James Heyworth, said there were ‘positives and negatives’ to her character. 

The previous conviction for violence went back to when she was a teenager in 2005.

The barrister continued: ‘The Facebook messages do her no credit whatsoever. She has been banned from all pubs in Clitheroe, which will help mitigate against this type of behaviour happening again. 

'She knows she’s done something very, very wrong.’

Judge Miss Recorder Tina Landale, passing the sentence, told Porter: ‘The victim was particularly vulnerable in the circumstances. You targeted her.’

Porter was sentenced to 10 months in prison and it was revealed she has a previous conviction for violence

Judge Landale said PC Pitcher ‘took particular pride’ in her teeth and had been caused anxiety, distress and pain.

She continued: ‘A serious aggravating feature is the public boasting and celebration. It added to the impact upon her.’

Porter’s brother Gary Place, of Chatburn, Lancashire, pleaded guilty to using threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour and was fined £75, with £85 costs and a £20 victim surcharge at an earlier hearing.
