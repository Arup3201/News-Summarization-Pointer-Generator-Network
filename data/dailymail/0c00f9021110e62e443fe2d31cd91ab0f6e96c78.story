Her father, Mike, took to Facebook early Friday to update fans on her status.

'She was in a lot of pain when we got to see her in the medical room at the base of the course,' he said.

'They loaded her in an ambulance and took her up to the ER for X-rays and an MRI.

'Heidi was in good hands with Dr. Sterett and several other U.S. team doctors. The news isn't good, though.'

It was a bitter pill to swallow for Kloser, who was just moments away from her first qualification run when the injuries occurred.

'She asked Emily and me if she was still an Olympian,' Kloser’s father said.

'We said, ‘Of course!’

Right before the Opening Ceremony on Friday night, Heidi Kloser Tweeted this photo with the caption: 'Heading to Opening Ceremonies! Excited that I will still get to walk!'

Kloser’s U.S. teammate, Lindsey Vonn, suffered a similar serious injury last year and won’t compete in Sochi.

Kloser, 21, had to be helped off the mountain and was taken to the medical clinic in the athletes village for evaluation.

Initially it was reported that her injuries were minor.

Her teammate, Heather Mcphie, spoke with media at the time.

'Her brain is fine, it's not really, really scary stuff, but we are all real concerned about her like you are anytime a teammate goes down,' she said.

McPhie said the course is in good shape and wasn't to blame for the accident.

'Unfortunately, it's part of our sport,' she said.

However then Mr Kloser confirmed his daughter would miss the February 8 mogul qualifiers.

'She's completely bummed, as we are,' confirmed the concerned parent.

'She was really hoping, all things considered, to at least be able to start in Saturday's final qualifier.'
