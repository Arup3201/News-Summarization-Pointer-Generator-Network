Leeds hooker Paul Aiton says he was unaffected by the drugs furore in Sydney as he helped the Rhinos lift the Challenge Cup for the first time for 15 years.

The 29-year-old Papua New Guinea international was reported by the Australian media to be one of 17 past and present Cronulla players offered a reduced 12-month ban for admitting taking prohibited substances during the 2011 season.

Twelve players, including Australia prop Paul Gallen, began their suspensions on Friday after accepting a deal offered by the Australian Sports Anti-Doping Agency but Aiton insists he has not been part of the investigation.

'I haven't been approached by anyone so I know just as much as anyone else, what's in the papers,' said Aiton, speaking on the subject for the first time in the aftermath of Leeds' 23-10 win over Castleford at Wembley.

Leeds coach Brian McDermott had maintained that the controversy had not affected his team's preparations and Aiton says he was grateful for the support of his team-mates.

'It's been like that for 18 months,' he said. 'It's not real good on the players - you can just tell how hard they've done it. My heart goes out to them but I haven't been approached.

'It's not good seeing your name like that in the paper. Especially when it's every paper and you're hearing from your mates (asking) 'what's going on here?'

'The players and the club rallied around me. They were very supportive.'

Aiton, who is in his first season with the Rhinos after initially moving from Cronulla to Super League with Wakefield in 2012, says he has no interest in getting to the bottom of the mystery.

'Not really, I'll just keep playing and show up for next week and just keep going,' said Aiton, who is in the first season of a three-year contract.

'It's up to others what they want to do. I've not heard from anyone.'
