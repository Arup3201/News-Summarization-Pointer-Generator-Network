Steven Gerrard was left in tears after Liverpool took a huge step towards winning the Barclays Premier League on a day of high emotion at Anfield.

Liverpool’s captain called his team-mates together immediately after the 3-2 win over Manchester City and gave an impassioned speech, saying: ‘Listen, this is gone. We go to Norwich, exactly the same. We go together. Come on!’

Afterwards, the England star described it as the 'longest 90 minutes I've ever probably played in' and said it was as if 'the clock was going backwards.'

Philippe
 Coutinho’s strike late in the second half means that if Liverpool win 
their last four games, then they will be champions for the first time 
since 1990. That sense of destiny, along with feelings from the 25th 
Hillsborough anniversary, sparked tearful scenes at the final whistle.

Gerrard
 said: ‘It was emotional. Very emotional. But we need to keep calm. 
There are still four big games to come. But that meant so much. They got
 back into the game and you fear the worst at that point.

‘But
 I think we showed that we are going to go to the wire, we are going to 
go all the way. Nothing has been won yet, but that was the biggest 
statement we have made so far. That was the longest 90 minutes I’ve ever
 probably played in.

Embrace: Gerrard hugs Martin Skrtel after the defender scores Liverpool's second goal

‘I 
kept flashing back to how long the clock was taking in cup finals and in
 big games I’ve played in. It felt like the clock was going backwards in
 some parts of that game.

‘That is such a big result. Now we’ve got four big cup finals left.’

Liverpool
 charged into a two-goal lead thanks to Raheem Sterling and Martin 
Skrtel but a David Silva strike and a Glen Johnson own goal swung the 
game City’s way before Coutinho gave the hosts a 10th Premier League win
 in a row.

Jordan 
Henderson was sent off for a challenge on Samir Nasri, but Liverpool 
manager Brendan Rodgers said: ‘Against all odds, we’re still fighting.

Following Liverpool's win over Manchester City, Steven Gerrard is now favourite with some bookmakers to be Sports Personality of the Year

‘The
 group are very tight; we have fostered a real closeness. That’s 
improving all the time and you need that if you want to challenge and 
win. It’s more than quality and rolling out good players, there has to 
be a cause and you can see that intensity. It’s very strong.

‘It
 shows we have the mentality to win the game today as we have the 
quality to score from anywhere. At 2-2, we might have lost the game but 
determination and resilience mean we dust ourselves off and go again. 
The level of some of the football was so good.’

Manuel
 Pellegrini’s misery continued with the news he could be without Yaya 
Toure for the run-in after the midfielder hurt his groin.

Pellegrini
 said: ‘I said before the game that this is not the end of the Premier 
League. ‘The most important thing now is about what we can do in the 
future. If Liverpool win four more games and end up winning 14 straight 
games, then maybe they deserve to win the title.

‘But
 we are going to continue fighting until the end. We play a game in hand
 against Sunderland on Wednesday. We also have another game to play, so 
if we win them, we will be one point behind Liverpool and one ahead of 
Chelsea.

‘Football is 
about mistakes and good things. Liverpool won the game with a mistake 
(from Vincent Kompany). Yes, we (should have had) a very clear penalty, 
but I don’t want to talk about the referee. It is not fair to say we 
lost the game because of the referee.’
