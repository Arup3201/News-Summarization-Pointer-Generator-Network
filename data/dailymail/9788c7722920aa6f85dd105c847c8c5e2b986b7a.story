House prices in London are rising more than 20 per cent a year, fuelling fears of a dangerous bubble.

Some boroughs in the capital have seen prices increase almost £100,000 in just one year, with the surge also pushing up prices across other parts of the South East, according to figures from the Land Registry.

The average house in the capital now costs £414,356, an annual rise of 13.8 per cent.

The boom is pricing many people out of the housing market altogether and forcing others to take on huge mortgages – which could lead to soaring repayments once interest rates rise.

The price of an average home in Hackney, east London, has risen by 21.5 per cent in a year to £528,737 – an increase of £93,500.

Elsewhere in the capital, the average house value has risen 20.1 per cent in Waltham Forest and 17.7 per cent in Islington.

The highest house prices in the country are in Kensington and Chelsea, where the average home is now worth £1.24million – a rise of 14.8 per cent – fuelled by wealthy foreign buyers.

The London boom is having an effect on prices in other parts of the South East, with Hertfordshire, Surrey and Reading all seeing increases of around 6 per cent.

Growth: The biggest rises are unsurprisingly in and around London.

Rising: Prices for flat and maisonettes rose more than any other house type.

However, the picture is very different in parts of the North East and Wales, where prices have fallen in the past year.

The huge variations across the country mean the national increase in house prices stands at 5.3 per cent, with the average home in England and Wales costing £170,000.

Earlier this week, the Bank of England expressed concerns that growing numbers of people are taking on supersize mortgages to get on to the property ladder. Nationally, around one in ten borrow more than four times their income to buy a home, with the figure in London rising to around one in five.

In a speech to the Housing London Symposium on Wednesday, Prince Charles voiced fears that the housing bubble could price young people out of London completely, and destroy their dreams of home-ownership.

Ed Stansfield, chief property economist at Capital Economics, warned that the Bank of England may not be able to prevent a dangerous boom and bust.

‘Whether they have the appetite or the ability to prevent such a scenario, while keeping interest rates low to support the wider recovery, remains to be seen,’ he said.

Martin Stewart, director of independent mortgage broker London Money, said: ‘House prices in London have become detached from reality.

‘Wealthy overseas buyers continue to use prime London properties as a hedge for their capital. This is driving prices up and cutting many aspiring Londoners, or London residents out.’
