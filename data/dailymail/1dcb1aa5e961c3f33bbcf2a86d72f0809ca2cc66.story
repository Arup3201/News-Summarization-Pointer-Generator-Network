Ed Miliband today faces the biggest crisis of his leadership, amid rising panic that his personal unpopularity will cost Labour victory at the next election.

Analysis of voter satisfaction ratings over four decades reveal Mr Miliband is down to minus 34. It means he is less popular than any Prime Minister or opposition leader at this point ahead of an election, except Michael Foot who led Labour to its worst ever defeat.

Jim Callaghan, Neil Kinnock, John Major, William Hague, Michael Howard and Gordon Brown all had higher net satisfaction ratings with IpsosMORI six months before being hammered at the ballot box. 

Analysis of IpsosMORI polling dating back to 1977 by MailOnline shows how only Michael Foot had worse personal satisfaction ratings than Ed Miliband six months before a general election

Mr Miliband has come under growing pressure from his own party to improve his own image and standing with voters, who do not view him as a future Prime Minister

Since becoming leader four years ago Mr Miliband has seen a collapse in his public satisfaction ratings.

A month after he defeated his brother for the leadership, 41 per cent per of voters were satisfied with Mr Miliband with just 19 per cent dissastified, giving a net rating of 19 points.

In the latest IpsoMORI survey, published two weeks ago, the figure had slumped to -34, twice as bad as David Cameron's -17.

'It's all just depressing,' a shadow cabinet minister said. 'People tell me they can't vote Labour it means Ed becomes PM. But it's my name on the ballot paper, not his.'

A senior backbencher added: 'People normally grow into the role, but he's shrunk.'

The Tories have made clear they will present the election campaign as a direct choice between Mr Cameron and Mr Miliband as a future Prime Minister, which senior Labour figures fear most.

Growing numbers liken the panic gripping the Labour party to the run-up to the 2010 election, when Gordon Brown's personal unpopularity and poor image was repeatedly raised by voters as a concern.

But the analysis shows that Mr Brown's satisfaction ratings stood at -25 six months before he led Labour to a thumping defeat in 2010.

Every Prime Minister and opposition leader since the late 1970s had better net satisfaction ratings than Mr Miliband, expect for Mr Foot

Mr Miliband started off well, but has seen his net satisfaction rating plummet. A senior Labour MP said: 'People normally grow into the role, but he's shrunk'

Only a quarter of voters say they are satisfied with Mr Miliband as Labour leader, with almost two thirds dissatisfied 

Tory leaders John Major, William Hague and Michael Howard all had better ratings than Mr Miliband before they were beaten by Tony Blair's New Labour in 1997, 2001 and 2005.

Only Michael Foot had worse support six months before his defeat to Margaret Thatcher in 1983, but only just - his net satisfaction of -38.

Ben Page, chief executive of IpsosMORI, said: 'Ed Miliband's personal ratings among voters are a serious problem for Labour – no-one has ever become Prime Minister with ratings like these, and without a lead on managing the economy.

'Only Michael Foot's ratings in the run up to the 1983 election were worse.

'On the other hand of course only twice has a government been in power for over two years and increased its share of the vote, and while Cameron is more popular than Miliband, the Conservatives remain much less liked than the Labour Party among voters.'

Critics point to Mr Miliband's disastrous party conference speech, which he delivered without notes and forgot to mention the deficit or immigration.

After being mocked for his difficulties eating a bacon sandwich, Mr Miliband claimed he was not a photo opportunities politician, contrasting his high-minded approach to David Cameron putting style over substance.

In a speech in July he attempted to present himself as serious and principled compared to Mr Cameron’s ‘superficial’ and image-driven approach.

The photo opportunity, he said, is ‘not where my talents lie – as you may have noticed’.

He said: 'If you want a politician who thinks that a good photo is the most important thing, then don’t vote for me. Because I don’t. But here’s the thing: I believe that people would quite like somebody to stand up and say there is more to politics than the photo op. And that culture diminishes our politics.’ 

But since then the Labour leader has posed wearing a pro-feminism t-shirt and gave a handful of change to a beggar while surrounded by photographers.

A former Cabinet minister told MailOnline said: 'What p***es me off is he said he would be about content not style, but it's all style and spin... and it's s***.

'The only thing worse than the idea he won't be Prime Minister is the thought that he might.'

Last night Mr Miliband reshuffled his frontbench team, appointing Lucy Powell as vice-chairman of the general election campaign.

She said she was going to 'unblock' the system to make sure the operation was working effectively.

It follows growing unease about the leader's office, and its failure to communicate with voters.

One frontbencher said: 'I told them we need to talk in a way that normal people understand. I'm not sure they understood what I meant.'

In a fresh blow, the New Statesman, which is traditionally supportive of Labour, warns that Mr Miliband's approach is haemorrhaging support on the Left to the Greens and the Scottish National Party.

The magazine says the Labour leader appears a product of his 'narrow background' and demonstrates no understanding of lower middle-class aspiration.

Jason Cowley, editor of the New Statesman, one of only two national publications to back Mr Miliband over his brother David for the Labour leadership in 2010, said he appeared 'very much an old-style Hampstead socialist'.

'He doesn't really understand the lower middle-class or material aspiration,' he writes. 'He doesn't understand Essex Man or Woman. Politics for him must seem at times like an extended PPE seminar: elevated talk about political economy and the good society.'

He adds: 'Miliband has a deterministic, quasi-Marxist analysis of our present ill.

'The Ukip insurgency, Scottish nationalism, the hollowing out of political parties, Islamist radicalisation, the loathing and distrust of elites: all are manifestations of a failed economic model.'

David Miliband. who was defeated by his brother for the Labour leadership in 2010, is now CEO of the International Rescue Committee. Last night he hosted the Annual Freedom Award Benefit Event in New York, attended by rock singer Sting and opera singer Danielle de Niese
