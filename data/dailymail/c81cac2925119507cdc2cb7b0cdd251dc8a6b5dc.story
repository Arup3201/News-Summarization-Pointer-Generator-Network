A quick-thinking shop worker used a bottle of Toilet Duck bleach to ensure a would-be robber failed to make a clean getaway.

Kili Moorthy bravely fought off a man in a balaclava, who was brandishing a needle, with the closest thing at hand - a bottle of toilet cleaner.

Mr Moorthy, 24, then chased the offender out of the newsagents where he was working after scaring him off with the domestic cleaning liquid.

Weapon: Mr Moorthy used Toilet Duck to defend himself from the would-be robber

Mr Moorthy, who was only working at the 
convenience store to cover for his sick cousin, said: 'The Toilet Duck 
was the first thing I saw so I just grabbed it.

'The guy had a needle but he seemed pretty scared of the bleach. It all happened so quick I just wanted to scare him off and get him out of there.'

The attempted robbery happened at Poole Convenience Store, in Dorset, at 7am on Monday.

The shop worker was forced behind the counter by the robber, but after reaching for the Toilet Duck, managed to chase him out of the store.

The robber left empty handed.

Mr
Moorthy said: 'I had only just opened the shop.

'He came in and I didn’t
think much of it, but then he came behind the counter and I could see 
something in his hand.

'There was no money in the till at all, it was empty. I called 999 straight away, and I had to go and speak to the police.

'It’s not my job, I was just there to cover, so I won’t be going back to work there for a while.'
