As she sat in a dressing room at the Royal Albert Hall, waiting nervously to sing before the Queen, Megan Adams received a Facebook message from her father, who had been serving overseas for five months.

It read: ‘Have a great time Chick. I wish I was there to see you. You will be fantastic and I’m very proud of you.’

‘I started crying when I read it because I just wanted my Daddy there so much’, recalls 10-year-old Megan.

Emotional: As she waited nervously to sing before the Queen, Megan Adams had no idea she would soon be reunited with her father Billy, who had been serving overseas for five months

Reunited: Megan couldn't contain her emotions when her father appeared at the Festival of Remembrance

What she did not know - and what her mother could not tell her - was that Lieutenant Commander Billy Adams was there.

The Royal British Legion had secretly flown him in from the Seychelles, where he heads the Navy’s operation to tackle piracy off the Somali coast, so he could watch his daughter sing at the Festival of Remembrance.

The scene that followed reduced half of the audience to tears, including Samantha Cameron and Sophie, Countess of Wessex. Even the Queen smiled broadly and exchanged comments with Prince Philip and Princess Anne.

Teary: The youngster was visibly overcome with emotion as she raced to be reunited with her father

Surprise: The Scottish schoolgirl ran into her father's arms in floods of tears as he knelt down to embrace her

Megan had performed on stage with the Poppy Girls, a choir of Servicemen’s daughters, when presenter Huw Edwards announced they had a surprise for her.

She looked up at the screen, believing her father may have left her a video message, only to see Lt Cdr Adams MBE striding on stage in his naval uniform.

Still clutching her microphone, the Scottish schoolgirl ran into her father’s arms in floods of tears as he knelt down to embrace her.

Speaking yesterday, his voice cracks momentarily as he recalls the reunion with his youngest daughter.

‘As I walked down the stairs on to the stage I was struggling to hold it together,' he says.

‘It was the emotion of the whole thing -
being away from my family, knowing Megan didn’t know I was there and 
then seeing her run towards me, well... I hugged her and told her, ‘you 
sang beautifully’.

As he talks, Lt Cdr Adams is interrupted by a phone call from the Navy. There has been a pirate attack off the coast of Madagascar.

Megan, continuing with the story, says: ‘When I saw him, I fell back into Bethany and Charlotte. I thought ‘Is that really my daddy?, and then the other girls said ‘Run Megan, it’s your dad’.

‘I cried when I saw him, because I miss him so much.

‘I am proud of what he does - stopping the pirates, but it is hard not getting to see him.’

Asked
what she misses about her dad, she says: ‘Messing around with him and 
our dog, Oscar, my dad picking me up from school - and he makes the best
toast.’

‘It’s putting the butter on at just the right moment’, her father jokes.

For the last six years, Lt Cdr Adams has lived in Rosyth, Dunfermline, 80 miles from wife Cheryl, and daughters Megan and Caitlin, 13, in Mauchline, Ayrshire, only seeing them at weekends.

Then on June 26, he was deployed to the Seychelles for a seven-month assignment, the longest he had been away from his family.

As the Navy’s only representative out
there, he was not able to take any leave during the posting, meaning he
had to miss all of Megan’s rehearsals and performances with the Poppy 
Girls.

‘He was heartbroken to be honest’, said Mrs Adams, 39, his wife of 17 years, ‘but he has got a job to do out there.’

Then last week, he received an email out-of-the-blue from his bosses asking if he was free to return home for Megan’s concert.

‘I saw the email trail and realised that lots of people were working hard to get me back home in time. It was incredible’, he said.

Lt Cdr, 43, naval liaison officer for the anti-piracy operation Atalanta, will now spend two days with his family, before returning to the Seychelles on Wednesday, where he will stay until January.

He said: ‘It will be my first 
Christmas away from the children, which will be difficult. But you get 
used to missing special occasions when you’re in the Navy.

‘I always cook Christmas dinner and I pick up the tree.

Royal appearance: Before the festival the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh viewed the plaque commemorating the renaming of the South Steps at the Royal Albert Hall to Queen Elizabeth II Diamond Jubilee Steps

Greeting: The Queen and Prince Philip stopped to talk with well-wishers on the way in to the Festival of Remembrance

‘The girls take it in turns each year to put the angel on the top - I never remember whose turn it is, but they always do. It’s going to be different for them.’

Megan adds: ‘My Dad always videos us opening our presents. I don’t know who will do that this year.

‘And I always pick him for my team when we play board games on Christmas Day, because he’s better than mum.’

In the meantime, Megan intends to make the most of the next 48 hours with her father.

‘We are going to go on The London Eye and to Harrods. And I am going to give him lots of hugs and not let him go.’
