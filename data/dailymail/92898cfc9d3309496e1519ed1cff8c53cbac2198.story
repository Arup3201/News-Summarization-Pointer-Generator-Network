Popular pontiff: Pope Francis waves to crowds as he arrives to his inauguration Mass in St. Peter's Square at the Vatican

Roman Catholics across the world are going back to church inspired by the charismatic figure of Pope Francis, church authorities say.

After years of decline, cathedrals in Britain have seen a 20 per cent rise in congregations since the Argentinian pope was elected as head of the Catholic Church eight months ago.

And the 'Pope Francis Effect' is being felt across the world, with new and lapsed Catholics surging back to the confession box 'by the hundreds or thousands', according to the Italian Centre for Studies of New Religions.

In Italy half of priests have noted a marked rise in support for the church.

The Italian opinion poll Opinioni reported this week that more than four in five Italians have a 'positive' or 'extremely positive' opinion of the Pope.

Spain, which had been experiencing a decades-long slump, has also seen attendance figures begin to climb since the pontiff's appointment.

Catholic leaders in France, the USA and Latin America have also reported growth in the numbers of churchgoing Catholics.

And Latin America - already the biggest single source of Catholic pilgrims to Italy - saw numbers of pilgrims to the centre of the faith rise by 20 per cent from the same period last year.

In Argentina there has been a 12 per cent increase in the number who define themselves as Christians since Pope Francis's appointment.

The number of Argentinian Catholic pilgrims to Italy has also seen a record increase of 66.5 per cent this year, while the total number of visitors to Rome has increased by 8 per cent overall.

Surge: Pope Francis greets a papal audience in Rome last week - attendees to St Peter's Square surged to 85,000 last month in contrast to the 5,000 who came to hear previous Pope Benedict XVI

Attendances at the Pope's weekly
address in St Peter’s Square have surged to 85,000 last month in 
contrast to 5,000-strong crowd attracted by his predecessor Benedict 
XVI.

Pope Francis has been dubbed an inspiration for public acts of humility.

Increase: Archbishop Vincent Nichols hailed the 'Pope Francis effect'

The 76-year-old carries his own 
suitcase and travels by bus rather than enjoy the chauffeur-driven car 
and lavish apartments normally accorded to the head of the world's 
biggest Christian congregation - although he did recently accept a 
29-year-old Renault 4 with 190,000 miles on the clock as a gift from a 
village priest.

He has also made some more radical 
statements, announcing publicly that he will not judge gay people, and 
that he will consult ordinary Catholics on controversial topics 
including contraception and sex before marriage.

The former Jesuit priest's down-to-earth attitude has helped the church despite paedophile and corruption scandals, particularly since he has vowed to reform Vatican bureaucracy.

Archbishop Vincent Nichols, head of the 
Catholic Church in England and Wales, has hailed the ‘Pope Francis 
effect’ for the increase in Roman Catholic attendance in Britain, 
saying: ‘God’s love shone through the
words and actions of Pope Francis.’

There are an estimated 1.2billion Catholics in the world - more than 40 per cent of them, or 483 million living in Latin America.

Europe has the next largest population of Catholics, at 277 million.
