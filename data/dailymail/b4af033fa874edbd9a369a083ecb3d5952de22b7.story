A British expat has died of suspected hypothermia after he slipped and fell into a ditch while out shopping near his hilltop village in Tuscany.

Stephen Paul Sorini-Dixon, 71, perished after getting stuck in the four foot gutter of icy water, investigators believe.

It is thought that he slipped in the dark and was unable to climb out, remaining there all night, exposed to the icy stream of water.

The pensioner who moved to Italy some years ago was found on Sunday morning by a hunter who spotted his shopping trolley.

The expatriate, who lived alone but has several children living in the UK, was last seen getting off a bus about a mile from his home after doing the shopping on Saturday evening.

On the way home in the dark he fell off the road into a substantial ditch, police believe. He was stuck with his arms and legs above him, failed to clamber out of the slippery slope and spent the night in the icy water of the stream, scientific police said.

The Briton, nicknamed the Englishman in the mountainous village, has several children who live in England but had lived in the area for years. The man' s children were informed and are thought have travelled to Italy to help with the funeral arrangements.

More than 6,000 Britons die abroad every year, averaging 100 a week, figures show. 

This is mostly down to the high number of elderly expatriates who live overseas, with the bulk opting to retire to the sunny climes of southern European countries such as Spain and Italy.

Most die in natural circumstances, but 10 per cent of all British people murdered were killed overseas, showing that crime also plays a part, official figures reveal. 

The statistics came as the Foreign Commonwealth Office came under fire for not being sensitive to the needs of grieving families who requested consular help over the death of a loved one abroad.

A damning report last month showed families had accused officials of being uncaring and unhelpful – and even of failing to dress appropriately – making their heartache even more traumatic.

The criticisms came in a report by a cross-party panel of MPs which ordered the Foreign Office to improve its services to bereaved families. 

MPs also demanded an inquiry into claims some torture victims were failed by consular staff.
