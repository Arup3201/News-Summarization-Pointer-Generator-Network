Christophe Berra dedicated his third Scotland goal to Dave Mackay – the day after the Hearts and Tottenham legend was laid to rest.

Berra came through the ranks at Tynecastle where the legendary midfielder ruled supreme in the late 1950s.

Hampden paid tribute to Mackay with a minute's applause before Wednesday night's game with Northern Ireland - and Ipswich defender Berra, who replaced Russell Martin at the break, ensured the night also had a fitting ending by heading home a winner with five minutes remaining.

'I met him a couple of times when I was at Hearts,' Berra recalled of Mackay. 'He was a confident person. I think it was the way he played, he wasn't shy and had a great career with Scotland, Hearts and Spurs.

'A great deal of respect has been shown to him in football, especially British football.

'So I'm especially pleased I scored tonight. He was strong and could bully people and was a player people could relate to. He had a great career and that minute's applause was great for him and his family.

'It was good to get a goal. That was my first Scotland appearance in a long time and it meant a lot to get 45 minutes. To also score a goal was even better.

'I'd almost scored from a corner five minutes before the goal when I had a header at the front post. I maybe should have done better.

'I said to Matt (Ritchie) to hang it up a bit and it was there to go and attack. I stuck my head on it and thankfully it went into the back of the net.

'It's my third goal for Scotland and my sixth of the season. As a defender, it' s good to add goals to my name.'

Despite heading his second career goal against Northern Ireland, Berra believes he will return to the bench when Gibraltar come calling on Sunday.

'Obviously I am down the pecking order,' he added. 'I just have to be patient and play well for my club and hopefully my international chance will come again.'

Until Berra's late intervention, it was a night of missed opportunities in more ways than one. Steven Fletcher, without an international goal since his one and only strike against Iceland almost six years ago, saw a couple of decent chances come and go.

Had the occasion been anything other than a friendly, he would have been beating himself up about it.

But perhaps the prospect of what should be a turkey shoot against Gibraltar on Sunday allowed him a degree of comfort.

'I'm looking to get back on the score sheet as soon as possible,' he said. 'It' s been a while. For me, tonight was just about getting some minutes under my belt.

'I've not played too much this year so it feels good to get back out there. It doesn't prey on my mind. If I wasn't getting chances, I'd be complaining but I' m getting them so I just need to start taking them.'

Asked if becoming the first Scotland player since Colin Stein to net a hat-trick come the weekend was an added incentive, Fletcher quipped: 'I need to get a goal just now never mind a hat-trick. Listen, if we get the opportunities hopefully we can take them.

'If that means one of us getting a few then great. First and foremost, we just want to get the goals that give us a win and push up the table.'

So much for two Celtic nations nipping the life out of each other as they sought a miniscule psychological edge to take into their remaining Euro qualifiers. Friendly was what it said on the ticket and, by heavens that is what we got.

At the conclusion of a remarkably featureless and benign game it was tempting to ask if much had been gained from it.

But, despite the lack of goals, Fletcher believed it was the perfect work-out ahead of Gibraltar on Sunday.

'It was good preparation,' he insisted. 'A few of the boys like myself having been playing too much football so it was good to get a few minutes.

'It's another win which keeps the momentum going. There's another big game on Sunday which we are all looking forward to.

'If we'd got an earlier goal, it would have been a bit more comfortable but at least we got one. It's good.

'We could have been ahead earlier. We'd a few chances in the first half – I'd a few myself.

'I'm going to blame the goalie for the one I missed and not myself. In fairness, he pulled off a few good saves although it was frustrating we never got the goal before we did. But the win keeps us going for the weekend.

'Both teams obviously had one eye on the games that really matter at the weekend. You could see that with the changes that were made.

'Both managers wanted to keep everyone's legs fresh. Both nations have got two big games coming up.'

Fletcher attempted to temper the expectation that Sunday's game will be a total formality.

'We're not going in there thinking we're going to run them into the ground,' he insisted. 'We just want to put on a performance that the gaffer sets us out to do and if we do that hopefully we can get the win.

'Goal difference doesn't matter against them but it will matter in terms of confidence. We've got a massive game against Ireland in the summer so if we can get a win and a few goals it will be happy days.'
