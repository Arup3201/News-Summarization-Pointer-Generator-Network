Tilda Swinton has been announced as the new face of Nars at the age of 53.

The British star will follow in the footsteps of fellow actress Charlotte Rampling, 68 - the face of Nars' Audacious Lipstick collection - to star in the cosmetics company's spring 2015 campaign.

The blonde beauty was shot for the ads by the brand's founder and artistic director François Nars, who described her as a 'living legend' and the 'perfect choice' to front the campaign.

He told WWD: 'As a photographer, working with an actress like Tilda is very enjoyable

'She is a living legend. I love her bold style and really admire her work. As an actress, she brings such strong personality to the camera. And as a woman, she lives the experience of transformation and expression. She was the perfect choice for Nars.' 

So far just one of three images from the campaign has been released. It shows Tilda posing with a black net scarf around her neck, her signature blonde cropped haircut standing on end.

The star looks stunning in graphic black eyeliner, her shoulders bare and her porcelain complexion flawless. 

Francois - who celebrated his eponymous brand's 20th birthday this year - previously gushed over The Grand Budapest Hotel star in a piece he wrote for Vogue's October issue in celebration of the milestone occasion.

The French-born make-up artist admitted he adored Tilda's 'ethereal' look and is an admirer of unconventional beauty.

He said: 'My favorite actresses - Greta Garbo, Marlene Dietrich, Silvana Mangano, Romy Schneider, Catherine Deneuve, Charlotte Rampling, Tilda Swinton - are not what you would call typical beauties.

'Tilda is almost ethereal, but these women I've used for Nars over the years are beautiful in an unconventional sense. I find my best work as a make-up artist has always been with those kinds of faces.' 

Tilda - a long time admirer of Francois - was equally thrilled with the team-up and has admitted the pair are keen to 'do more things together'. 

She said: 'I met François only recently, having long been an admirer of his from afar for many years.

'I liked him immensely and immediately and we were eager, from that first session, to do more things together. [The shoot was] the greatest of fun - supremely nice people, full of ease and play.'

This is just the latest in a sequence of 40+ women nabbing big-name cosmetics contracts.

Prior to Charlotte Rampling, 46-year-old Daphne Guinness was chosen as the face of Nars. 

In February, Marc Jacobs named Jessica Lange, 65, as the face of Marc Jacobs Beauty, and L'Oreal's spokespersons include Andie MacDowell, 56, and Diane Keaton, 68
