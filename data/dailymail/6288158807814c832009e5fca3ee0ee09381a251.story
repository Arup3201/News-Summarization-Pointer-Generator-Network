It is supposed to be as blockbuster as they come. Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi - with all of their individual records, global fame and last six Ballon d'Ors between them - do battle in Britain's most iconic venues.

The trouble is, Old Trafford didn't feel as if it was the preface scene to one of the great modern day rivalries in world football. 

Those in front of the cameras on Monday trotted out the party lines that yes, it was their man who deserved to clinch this year's Ballon d'Or, and no, their opinions weren't for changing. 

Cristiano Ronaldo and his team-mates showed off their skills during a brief training session on Monday night

On Tuesday the home of Manchester United holds a fixture which ought to capture the imagination but feels as if - for the two respective camps, anyway - that the playground debate as to who's more complete is undermining what is a showpiece in its own right.

There have been various projections as to how many will flock to the North West, but the club are hopeful of as many as 50,000. 

They had sold around 30,000 at the close of play on Monday with tickets available on the gate. If those close to the story are bored to tears of talking, there remains a healthy appetite from the paying public to watch them pit their wits against each other internationally.

Even if they represent an unwanted distraction to two teams who need performances, it is an evening you will not be able to take away from the thousands of schoolchildren who want to catch a glimpse of their heroes.

Some waited patiently outside the Stretford End before Ronaldo trained in a bobble hat. Any chance they can get for a quick peak.

Argentina captain Messi will hope to show on Tuesday night that he is still on a level with Ronaldo

The 29-year-old is back for the first time since knocking United out of the Champions League in 2013 and this brings the relative merits of both superstars into sharp focus. 

Not wholly unsurprising then that when met with the words Ronaldo and Messi, Richardo Carvalho bore a look of acceptance with a wry smile. 

Gerardo Martino asserts the latter should claw back the game's glitziest individual prize. Portugal's Fernando Santos disagrees, with both managers voting for their men with all the predictability of a politician at his local polling station come election Thursday. 

'They are both genius,' Santos said. It was the closest we came to any sort of hyperbole. 

Whether towing the party line or not, those within the Portuguese camp are vehement in proclaiming their galactico will get his hands on the golden trophy again in January. 

For Ronaldo, that'll mean two on the spin and a third overall. 

Ronaldo's record this season is exceptional, and he will want to continue his scoring on his former ground

Carvalho, now 36 and back in the international fold after missing out on the World Cup after being put out to pasture by ex-manager Paulo Bento, said: 'I think Ronaldo is the best [in the world]. 

'It is normal to speak about Cristiano and Messi but it is Argentina versus Portugal. For us Portuguese, everyone is expecting that Cristiano can win the third Golden Ball.' 

There is no reason to suggest Carvalho is anything but spot on. Ronaldo broke the record for number of goals scored in a single Champions League season and dragged Carlo Ancelotti's Real to that title kicking and screaming. 

He has recently been recognised as the best in La Liga and - Carvalho believes - is 'almost perfect', whereas the decision to hand Messi the Player of the Tournament award in Brazil was one to raise more than a few eyebrows.

'Cristiano always wants more, even in training,' Carvalho added. 'Maybe next he can break his own records.' 

While the former Chelsea defender offered some flesh on the bones, Martino was at his most pragmatic. 

'I cannot separate sentiment from my objective decision,' he said, somewhat rehearsed.

'Whatever season Messi had on footballing grounds, I would still vote for him.' 

They want to get in and out with minimal fuss. If it's anything like Messi's trip to Upton Park last week, marked with the constant flash of cameras, they won't be allowed to slip away unnoticed.
