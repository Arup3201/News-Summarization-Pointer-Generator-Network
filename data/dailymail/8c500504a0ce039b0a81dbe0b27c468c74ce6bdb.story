A Brazilian designer claims to have the perfect product to brighten up couples' time between the sheets.

Aline Darc Piculo dos Santos, 22, has created touch sensitive lingerie that lights up when contact with it is made.

The California-based Brazilian said her creation, called Toque, will help people 'connect during intimate moments.'

She came up with the idea of putting micro sensors into bras and knickers that will illuminate when touched in the hope it will spice up people's love lives and make them spend more time on foreplay.

Explaining her idea, which she said is based on personal experiences, Aline said: 'Sex is one of the most intimate situations and a lot of people are selfish and just want to orgasms, they do not care with their partner. Yet, sex is not just about that. It is about intimacy, closeness, interaction and connection. After all, you do not have sex with someone you do not have at least a connection with, right? 

'Thinking about that, Toque was created with the purpose of connecting couples during intimate moments. Toque is a Portuguese word for touch. It is a lingerie with a micro sensor of touch that lights up when someone touches it.'

Aline envisions her underwear in different fabrics such as satin, lace and Lycra.

While the concept is currently just that, Aline hopes her design could now become reality after she recently won an award for it.

She won the 'fashion and accessories' category in LELO's Global UnDesign Awards, scooping a cash prize of $1000 (£615).

The Swedish intimate lifestyle brand launched the competition to challenge global designers to 'tear off the shackles of convention and rethink the meaning of good design by encouraging genuine connections between people.'

After receiving more than 500 entries from 55 countries, Aline's illuminating underwear idea was the most popular following a public vote.

Aline said the accolade has strengthened her resolve to make fashion design her career - something she has been doing for the past four years by undertaking a university course.

She said: 'Coming to the USA to study and winning a contest means having my work and efforts until now recognised and valued. It confirms that this is the career I am meant to be.

'I feel proud of myself because I never thought I would participate or even win a contest. This means I can change the world as I wanted when I started college.' 

Whether her Toque designs can change the world is debatable but failing that, Aline said she'll just be happy if her creations can change someone's life.

'I want my designs to make a difference in someone's life, to make it better,' she said.
