A promising teenage artist has died after police Tased him for allegedly spraying graffiti on a wall.

Israel Hernandez-Llach, 18, had sprayed an 'R' - the first letter of his artist name, Reefa - on an abandoned McDonalds when police saw him and gave chase in Miami, Florida at 5am on Tuesday.

After officers followed him over fences and down alleys, the teen ran towards them and, fearing a physical alercation, officers Tased the youth to the ground, Police Chief Ray Martinez said.

Loss: Israel Hernandez-Llach, 18, has died after he was Tased by police who caught him spraying graffiti on an abandoned building. The teenager was known for his art and photography in Miami

'During the foot pursuit, the subject
 encountered officers face to face... and ignored officers' commands to 
stop,' Martinez said. 'In order to affect his 
arrest, an officer deployed his conducted electrical weapon (TASER).

'The officers were forced to use the Taser to avoid a physical incident.'

He was hit once in the chest and 
collapsed, and when officers saw he was in distress, he was transported 
by fire-rescue to Mount Sinai Hospital. He was pronounced dead at 
6.15am.

His friends Felix Fernandez and Thiago Souza said they had been serving as lookouts when he was seen by police on Tuesday morning.

Incident: The teenager had tried to escape from police after they spotted him on Tuesday morning, but they eventually caught up with him. He died after he was Tased once in the chest

According to Amnesty International, between 2001 and 2008, 351 people in the U.S. died after being shocked by police Tasers. Another report said there were another 190 taser-related deaths in the U.S. between 2009 and 2013, bringing the total to 541.

Critics of Taser guns have argued that the stun device can cause cardiac arrest or heart attacks and subsequently death, even in those who appear healthy. Pre-existing medical conditions or drug use - in association with the shock - have also been blamed for the deaths.

Earlier this week, it was reported that John Wrana, a 95-year-old World War II veteran, died after he was Tased and shot with bean-bag ammo by police after he brandished his cane at officers.

Police had been called to his Chicago assisted living home because he was being combative while being involuntarily committed for medical treatment, it was reported.

They claimed that, after he was 
captured, they saw the officers push the teenager against a wall and 
high-five as he lay motionless on the ground.

'That made me feel terrible inside,' Fernandez told WSVN. 'These cops are gruesome, and they don't really care.'

'They
 were making fun of how he tensed up when he got Tased,' one of the 
teenagers told CBS Philadelphia.

'They were just laughing, "You should've seen him, you 
should've seen him".'

An 
autopsy has been completed but the medical examiner has not yet released a cause of death. The death is also under investigation by the city and
 the state attorney's office.

Deaths by Taser are uncommon but not 
unheard of. Autopsies often find that the victim had been taking drugs 
or suffered from a pre-existing medical condition, the Miami Herald noted.

Hernandez's friends told CBS Philadelphia that earlier in the day they had been smoking marijuana and a toxicology test is now being carried out on Hernandez's body.Â

'The city of Miami Beach would like to extend their condolences to the family of Israel Hernandez,' Martinez said.

The Miami News Times reported that the teenager had only sprayed a few inches of graffiti - which spelled the letter 'R' - before he was chased.

Hernandez,
 who moved from Colombia with his family when he was 13, was already an 
award-winning artist known in the area for his sculptures, paintings, 
photographs and graffiti work.

An image on a Facebook page which appears to belong to Hernandez shows a 
Certificate of Special Congressional Recognition from Congress for his 
participation in an art competition for high school students. The award 
is signed by Debbie Wasserman Schultz, a Florida U.S. Representative.

Herb
 Kelly, one of his art teachers at Miami Beach High, said: 'It was an 
honor to work with him. He was cutting edge. He had such awesome 
potential. To lose his life the way he did is tragic.'

The
 teenager, who was also a skilled skateboarder, had recently launched a 
line of skateboards that he designed and had art exhibited at various 
galleries in the city.

'He wanted to change the world somehow 
through art,' Hernandez's sister, Offir, told the Herald. 'We want answers. We only want to know what happened.'

The family has hired a lawyer, Todd McPharlin, who said they want an independent investigation.

A protest march to demand answers from the police is being held in the city at 1pm on Saturday.
