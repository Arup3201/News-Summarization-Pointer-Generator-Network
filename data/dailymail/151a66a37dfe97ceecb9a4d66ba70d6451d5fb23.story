Connah Smith, 20, of Brighton, East Sussex, 'stabbed a former colleague and her housemate, threatened to kill them, covered them in petrol and threw matches and told them not to call police for a day'

A Sainsbury worker went online and searched 'what's the best way to murder somebody and not get caught?' before attacking and trying to set fire to two young women in their home, a court has heard.

Connah Smith, 20, stabbed a former colleague and her housemate, dunked one in the bath, threatened to kill them, covered them in petrol and threw matches at them.

Then when he left after the attack on Gabby Price and her housemate Megan Parsons, he allegedly said: 'Don't tell the police, give it a day. I want to have a good night's sleep.'

The pair finally escaped their more than seven-hour ordeal when one of them pretended she was having a miscarriage.

Mr Smith, of Brighton, East Sussex, is standing trial at Lewes Crown Court for the attempted murder of Ms Price and Ms Parsons.

He had a platonic relationship with Ms Price, a former co-worker in Sainsburys, despite his wish to take things further, the court heard.

The attack allegedly occurred overnight between March 29 and 30, at the home the two women shared in Dean Street, Brighton, when Mr Smith was 19.

Mr Smith, a former Sainsbury's worker, has pleaded guilty to assault with intent to cause serious bodily harm, false imprisonment and making threats to kill against both women.

But he denies attempting to murder them.

Jurors heard how in the 'weeks and months' before the attack his internet searches also included 'how are most serial killers caught?'

Other searched on the internet included 'stabbed in the neck scene' and 'evidence you would not expect to leave'.

He had also viewed violent pornography, the court heard.

Dale Sullivan, prosecuting, said Mr Smith met trainee nurse Gabby Price, now 22, while they both worked at the Sainsbury's in Brighton.

He said their relationship was platonic despite his wish to take things further.

On March 29, Mr Smith waited for Ms Price to come home from work shortly after 6pm, the court heard.

He asked to use her toilet before dragging her into her bedroom and stabbing her in the legs when she struggled.

When Ms Parsons, now 21, came home, he stabbed her in the head and neck, later holding her underwater in a cold bath using his foot.

When petrol failed to ignite after he had doused the women in it and thrown matches at them, he allegedly said: 'Oh, this is not what happens in films. I thought it would be a bigger explosion.'

The women's ordeal ended shortly after 3am when Ms Parsons pretended to have miscarriage and Smith let her call 999 on his phone before leaving the home.

On leaving he allegedly said: 'Don't tell the police, give it a day. I want to have a good night's sleep.'

A day earlier he was seen on the victims' street in a rented van holding a knife.

The trial continues.
