Some dive underwater to grab their food and some even try to swat the salmon out of the water.

Even though human proximity to bears is generally a bad idea, Mr Nolan said the feeding frenzy draws in spectators from all over the world.

These beautiful and colossal grizzly bears are seen at Brooks Falls, in Katmai National Park, Alaska, fishing for salmon in order to fill up for the long winter ahead.

The salmon travel from the north part of the Pacific Ocean into the waters of the Katmai National Park.

They are so tired by the time they reach the park that they die, right after giving birth to the new salmon.
