For the ‘unsung heroes’ chosen to bear the Olympic flame on its journey around Britain, the torch they carry is meant to be a proud keepsake to show to future grandchildren.

Yet hours after the relay began on Saturday, the souvenirs were already appearing on eBay.

Some runners put their torch up for sale even before they had carried the flame, offering to post them to the highest bidder immediately after their leg of the event.

Others offered to include the white-and-gold torchbearer uniforms.

Several runners asked for a minimum of £100,000. When contacted by the Mail, some said they planned to donate the proceeds to charity, but others admitted they were simply cashing in.

The majority of the 8,000 torchbearers were selected after being nominated by friends and family for their work in the community.

The 70-day relay started in Land’s End on Saturday and will finish on July 27 at the opening ceremony of the Games.

It cost £495 to make each torch, but runners were offered the chance to buy them for just £215 while those who won their places through sponsors such as Coca-Cola were given them free.

Yesterday, readers flooded Mail Online with their views. One wrote: ‘I am so incensed by this total lack of respect for anyone including us folk who were so proud to see you carrying it.’

Bids for the prized torches have reached in excess of £150,000 on eBay, although it is not clear if the auctions have been targeted by hoaxers

Another suggested that the torches should have been issued with a covenant that they could not be sold for at least ten years.

Torchbearer Andrew Bell, 32, who ran his relay leg in Marazion, Cornwall, on Saturday, took down his eBay advertisement after receiving criticism.

He said: ‘I understand some people may find the idea of selling an Olympic torch offensive but we could genuinely use the money.

‘Without giving you a sob story, we’ve a lovely baby boy and my wife has just gone back to work after maternity leave.

Also, the torch is nearly a metre long, and looks weird on the mantelpiece.’

Community gardener Sarah Milner Simonds, 38, from Burnham-on-Sea, Somerset, will run through Dunster today. Her torch has already attracted bids of up to £7,000.

She said she would donate any proceeds towards her organisation, the People’s Plot, which helps community gardening projects.

‘I was wondering whether it was right to sell the torch and so I asked my dad, who is in his eighties.

He said that one could create much more of a legacy using that funding than one could by using a bit of shiny bling that 8,000 other people have.’

Yesterday, more than a dozen torches were up for sale on eBay. One lot advertised ‘a souvenir to collect and treasure’.  

A spokesman for Olympic organisers Locog said: ‘The majority of people will want to keep their torch, but ultimately it’s their property and for them to decide what to do with it. We hope the torches and uniforms find good homes.’

Today, 100 days from the opening of the Paralympic Games, the remaining one million tickets go on sale.

Organisers announced yesterday that Coldplay will headline the Paralympics closing ceremony.
