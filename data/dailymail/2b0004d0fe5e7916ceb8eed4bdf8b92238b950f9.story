Six British firms have been linked to a fire at a garment factory in Bangladesh which has killed 10 people.

It comes just six months after a similar building collapsed in the Asian country, claiming 1,100 lives.

Deputy manager of the factory Molla Boadnuzzamah, listed Next, Primark, George, Gap, H&M, and Morrisons as customers who were using the Aswad Composite Mills factory, ITV reports.

The names - aside from Morrisons - were confirmed with other workers.

Inferno: The blaze is believed to have started in the knitting section of the garment factory when a faulty machine exploded

Recovery: Bangladeshi firefighters search through debris of the garment factory after a fire swept through it in Gazipur outside Dhaka, claiming 10 lives

Disaster: Fire officers said that the remains of the workers discovered inside the factory were 'charred beyond recognition'

H&M said that fabric for some of 
their clothes was made in the factory: 'H&M has got a business 
relationship with Palmal Group, which owns several factories.

'H&M
works with a sister unit to the affected factory. The name of the 
factory producing for H&M is called ASWAD COMPOSITE MILLS LTD (Unit 
2) and is approved for production by H&M.

'Aswad
Knit Composite factory is a component factory. They make fabric and 
yarn for different factories that produce garments. One of the factories
that they deliver fabric to is Aswad COMPOSITE MILLS LTD . Hence, we 
don’t have a direct business relationship with the affected factory.'

Primark has said it stopped using the supplier amid concerns. A spokesman said: 'Primark placed its last order in March of this year, indicating that it would place no further orders following the identification of violations of its code of conduct and management’s unwillingness to resolve these to Primark’s satisfaction.'

Primark placed its last order in March of this year, indicating that it would place no further orders following the identification of violations of its code of conduct and management’s unwillingness to resolve these to Primark’s satisfaction.  A small amount of outstanding orders was stored in the warehouse at the Aswad Composite Mills site, awaiting shipment.

Incidents like this demonstrate the requirement for the Accord to be effective, and for all members to work in collaboration for sustainable change in Bangladesh.'

The MailOnline has also contacted Gap and Morrisons.

Action: The 10 people who were killed in the fire were working overtime according to local reports. A government investigation has since been launched

Under control: Emergency services fought the blaze for around 10 hours before they managed to douse the flames and enter the building

Poor record: The Bangladeshi clothing industry has come under increased scrutiny after a string of similar disasters in unsafe factories

Next said it used supplier Marina Garments, which had sourced fabric from the Aswad Unit One Mill. 

A
spokesman added: 'As the cause of the fire is unknown, it is not clear 
whether any audit would have prevented this tragedy.  Once the cause is 
known, as routine NEXT will review its procedures, including the extent 
to which it needs to look further down the supply chain - particularly 
in high risk areas such as Bangladesh.'

George at Asda confirmed it was looking into its involvement.

The
blaze at the Aswad garment factory in Gazipur, just outside Dhaka, took
firefighters 10 hours to bring under control early this morning.

The
cause of the fire is not yet known but reports coming out of Asia 
suggested it may have started in the knitting section of the building 
wen a faulty machine exploded.

It
has been reported that the factory had recently produced clothes for 
Western retailers, including the American Wal-Mart chain.

The Wall Street Journal also
reported that it had in the past produced clothes for the Canadian Joe 
Fresh label, and Hudson's Bay Co. according to online 
shipping sites.

A spokesman for Hudson's Bay said its last shipment from 
the factory was in April. It had subsequently decided not to use the factory anymore, but would not be drawn on why.

Loblaw said it 
was looking into it, and Wal-Mart said it was 'working 
to understand the facts and will take appropriate action based on our 
findings.'

The Bangladeshi government confirmed they have launched an investigation.

Fire officer Zafar Ahmed confirmed that factory general manager Rashiduzzaman Mandal was among the fatalities.

According to the director of the factory, Emdad Hossain, 
170 workers of the factory's 3,000 strong workforce were inside when the blaze took hold.

It is believed that those killed were working overtime.

District administrator Dilruba Khanom 
said that emergency services were waiting until sunrise to complete 
their search of the factory. They warned that the number of casualties 
could rise.

He said: 'They have managed to control the fire in most parts 
of the factory, but the warehouse is still burning. The 
bodies are charred beyond recognition.'

The Bangladeshi clothes production industry, which is the third largest in the world, has come under heavy criticism after a string of workplace disasters in recent years. 

Last November, 112 workers were killed in a fire at another clothes warehouse close to Dhaka.

In that incident, it was reported that workers were unable to escape because there were not enough emergency exits in the building where they were working, with some having to leap to from windows.

The fire broke out on the ground floor of the building and spread quickly to the upper floors but all three exit staircases led to the engulfed bottom level.

At the time, one expert claimed that, had there been at least one emergency exit through outside the casualties would have been much lower.

Major Western brands including Disney and Sears were said to have been among the companies having their products manufactured there.

The collapse of the eight-storey Rana 
Plaza in Savar in April this year prompted more protests and calls for 
improved safety measures.

As a result of that tragedy, international retailers such as Primark agreed to conduct inspections at factories from which their goods were sourced.

Bangladesh earns $20 billion a year from garment exports, mainly to the United States and Europe.

The sector employs about 4 million workers, mostly women. 

An engineering survey shown to The Associated Press after the Rana Plaza collapse showed many Bangladesh garment factories added floors that the building foundations couldn't support and were located in converted residential buildings not designed to withstand use of heavy equipment.
