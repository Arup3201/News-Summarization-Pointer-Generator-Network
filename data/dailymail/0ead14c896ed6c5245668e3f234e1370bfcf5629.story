A West Bromwich street has a new sign to properly honour Robert Edwin Phillips, a First World War Victoria Cross medal winner, after officials got his name wrong

His heroism in World War One was honoured with a Victoria Cross and earned his name a place in the military history books.

Robert Phillips, then 21, risked his life dashing across open ground under heavy fire to rescue his wounded commanding officer, who also won the VC that same day, during a fierce battle with the Turks in Mesopotamia, now modern day Iraq, in 1917.

But despite being his home town West Bromwich’s only winner of Britain’s highest award for gallantry, bungling officials got his name wrong when a new road was named after him in 2000 - by putting up a sign reading Edwin Phillips Drive.

His great nephew Derek Pinches spotted the error - Edwin was his middle name but he was always known as Robert or Bob - when he visited the West Midlands town for the unveiling of a commemorative blue plaque at his brave relative’s childhood home nearby eight years ago.

He contacted a local historian who branded the mix-up ‘shameful’ and a campaign was launched for a new, correct sign.

A battle of a different sort then followed – as residents objected to the ‘inconvenience’ of having to re-register their details with utility companies and banks if the road name was changed.

After renewed pressure to see Captain Phillips’ memory properly honoured in the centenary year of the outbreak of the 1914-18 war, a new, larger sign will finally be officially unveiled today - but the road will still be called Edwin Phillips Drive.

In smaller writing below, however, an explanatory panel adds: ‘Commemorating West Bromwich-born Capt. Robert Edwin Phillips V.C., 1895-1968. Awarded the Victoria Cross during the First World War.’

Yesterday Dr Pinches, 70, a retired chartered electrical engineer, of Stafford, said: ‘I was a bit disturbed when I saw the old sign for the first time. But I’m more than happy now - the new sign is unusual, you don’t normally see one with an explanation underneath.’

Local historian John Price, who led the campaign backed by local MPs, said: ‘It was shameful they got his name wrong. Naming a road after someone is meant to be an honour, but that was more of a dishonour.

‘A lot of residents didn’t even know why their road was called what it was, but how could they when his name was wrong? It was my idea to add the panel. It’s terrific a compromise has been reached.’

Captain Phillips was serving with the 13th Battalion Royal Warwickshire Regiment when he won his VC. At the time he was a lieutenant.

He survived the war, married twice, had three children and worked for the Inland Revenue. He had moved to Lostwithiel, Cornwall, by the time of his death aged 73 in 1968.

After the idea of changing the road’s name was proposed, 85 per cent of the street’s residents opposed it when surveyed.

Jocyceline Stephenson, 71, a retired nurse who has lived in the road since the houses were built in 2000, said: ‘It would’ve caused so much trouble, with insurance, utilities, everything having to change, and so many people you would have to get in touch with.

‘You’d have all the problems of moving house, without actually going anywhere.

‘If they’d suggested it when we first came here maybe it would have been a bit different. But after 14 years it’s a bit much. None of us knew who Edwin Phillips was when we came here, which is no surprise if that wasn’t his real name.

‘I’m happy with the new sign. It explains who he was, and we keep our address.’

Street names can be suggested by the developer of a new street, but are ultimately chosen by councillors in the relevant ward, who take it in turns, in West Bromwich.

Sandwell Council claim they have no idea how the mistake was made in the first place or who originally put forward the name Edwin Phillips Drive.

A well-placed source said: ‘We have no records on it or why ‘Edwin Phillips’ was chosen, but it must have been after Captain Phillips.

‘The positive thing is that if it had been called Robert Phillips Drive from day one most people still wouldn’t have known who he was or why he’s important. Now everyone can see.’
