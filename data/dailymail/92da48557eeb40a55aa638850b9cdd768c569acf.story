If you’re fed up with charging your smartphone every night – not to mention trawling through hundreds of features just to make a call – then you’re in luck.

Nokia has unveiled a simple £13 mobile phone that can last for 35 days on a single charge.

It is aimed at emerging markets where electricity is rare, but could also be sold as a back-up phone.

It’s now the cheapest phone in the Finnish firm’s range, and was hailed 
as ‘the ultimate festival phone’ at its launch.

A spokesman for Nokia said: ‘The phone
 was created to offer the essentials – phone calls and SMS – but also 
some desirable extras.

Nokia’s experience in optimising phone quality, 
combined with its global footprint and economies of scale, is a major 
contributor to being able to work to such a low price.’

The firm also used the Mobile World 
Congress in Barcelona to launch three other low-cost devices, including a
 £120 smartphone, the Lumia 520.

Experts predict this will be a big year for cheap smartphones, as firms try to attract customers in the developing world.

Nokia's £13 mobile is set go go on sale later this year, and is expected to be aimed at emerging markets as well as being targetted as a 'backup phone' in Europe.

The smartphone, which operates with 
Windows 8, could be perfect for colder countries with its 
super-sensitive touch-screen technology, meaning it can be used while 
wearing gloves, the firm said.

But
 with experts predicting a big year for cheap smartphones as developers 
try to make inroads into the developing world, the Lumia 520 could be 
seen in India or Africa more than Scandinavia.

The phone also comes with a 5-megapixel camera and access to the music streaming service Nokia Music.

Those
 two phones were launched alongside the Lumia 720, which Nokia are 
pitching at 'socialites', and the £56 'candybar'-style 301.
