Service dogs now have a place to mark their territory at Detroit Metropolitan Airport in the form of two indoor patches of grass.

The 'porch potties' near gate A-34 in McNamara Terminal were unveiled today in a 'ribbon-biting' ceremony.

One of the patches is made of artificial turn while the other is real grass and both come with mini fire hydrants for the city dogs.

The airport has gone to the dogs: Service animals now have their own place to relieve themselves with the installation of two new patches of grass inside the Detroit airport. Above, service dogs Cricket (left) and Jello (right) inspect the porch potties

After the dogs have done their business, owners can press a rinse button which sets off sprinklers to keep the patches clean.

Delta Airlines worked with the airport to create the Service Animal Relief Area, which employees are now calling simply 'Central Bark'.

Before the patches were installed, people traveling with service animals had to go outside and pass back through TSA.

'When you can't get outside, when you don't have enough time to go through TSA coming back through, it's a wonderful convenience for our dogs,' Deb Davis of Paws with a Cause told Fox Detroit.

'When the dog leaves home that's the last time it can do it's 'duty' until it reaches the other side of baggage claim and its destination.

'Now its so much more of a convenience and so much healthier for our pets to travel comfortably,' she added.
