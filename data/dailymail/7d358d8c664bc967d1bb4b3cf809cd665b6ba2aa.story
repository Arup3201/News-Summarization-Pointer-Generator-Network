Blogger Lana Hirschowitz felt the wrath of an online ‘cult’ after she dared to speak out against the all-in-one kitchen appliance 

The article went viral and became the topic of contentious debate which resulted in a storm of criticism for Ms Hiroschowitz, which interestingly she predicted in the opening of her article.

‘I’m almost scared to write this post. I feel like I am talking out against the cult. 

'I worry that I’ll be ostracized like a leper from a community that prays before the Thermomix, but I’m taking the chance,’ she added.

Ms Hirschowitz's article didn't offer any particularly harsh criticisms of the Thermomix, in fact, she even acknowledged that the appliance was ‘great at what it does.’

Her gripe was that, unlike the swarm of devoted fans, she didn’t find the appliance ‘life changing.’

Ms Hirschowitz said she was left 'teary' after being called a 'scammer' and a 'poor little rich girl'

The Thermomix community have a large group of vocal online followers who didn’t take her comments lightly.

Ms Hirschowitz became the target of an online attack which brought her integrity into question. 

She was labelled a ‘scammer’ and a ‘poor little rich girl’, some posters even saying she was using the blog post to obtain a free Nutribullet.

The Thermomix is known to have dedicated band of followers who have been labelled as a 'cult'

In a Youtube video she posted on Monday with Kerri Sackville she said she was brought to tears after reading the comments and condemned those who personally attack others online for merely expressing an opinion.

‘I just want to write my opinion and not be vilified for it.’

‘It’s just an appliance.’ she added.

Ms Hirschowitz took to Twitter to defend herself and those who have been attacked online for simply expressing their opinion 

The critics soon became the criticised as commenters on social media started to turn on the ‘Thermomix hate brigade’

Some bloggers apologised and even back peadled claiming they ‘got a little over excited’ and’ should stay away from the news in the future.’

The Thermomix has a dedicated legion of food blog followers who started posting hate instead of recipes  

In a show of defiance Ms Hirschowitz posted a picture to Twitter on Monday of her  happily cooking a laksa without the assistance of the Thermomix, instead she used a run of the mill pot.

This wasn’t the first instance the Thermomix came under public scrutiny with social media backlash after a new model was released in Australia without 'appropriate warning.' 

Customers said they felt duped after buying the substandard model only days or weeks before the upgrade was released.

Australian comedy duo Kate McLennan and Kate McCartney also lampooned the Thermomix as part of their parody cooking series 'The Katering Show'.

In the video, which has almost 1.5 million views on Youtube, the pair describe the $2,000 appliance as 'something you buy because you've always wanted to join a cult, but don’t have the energy for group sex’ or it's 'the kind of a appliance that your rich mother-in-law gives you as a wedding gift, because she doesn't think you can cook'. 

The Thermomix was first launched in Australia back in 2001 with some 80,000 units being sold in 2014 alone.

The German-designed appliance claims to do the job of twelve appliances, boasting the ability to weigh, chop, blend, knead, steam, juice, grate, whisk, simmer and crush.
