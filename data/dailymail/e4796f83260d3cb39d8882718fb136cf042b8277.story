An American teacher, shot dead by gunmen in the Libyan city of Benghazi on Thursday, believed his Christian faith would guide and protect him in the volatile region. 

Ronald Smith, 33, married and with a young son, was gunned down on a morning run by men riding in a jeep, close to where U.S. Ambassador Christopher Stevens was killed last year. 

No one has claimed responsibility but the teacher's death comes days after an al Qaeda chief urged Libyans to attack America as revenge for a U.S. special forces op which snatched a terrorist suspect in Tripoli.

Mr Smith, from Texas, made a video for the Austin Stone Community Church before he left for Libya. He said that he was worried about adapting to Libyan life but felt a deep desire to spread a spiritual message. The teacher said: 'If there's any single person in the entire universe that you can take a chance on, it's God.'

The video clip, shown by CBS, shows Ronnie and his wife Anita boarding the plane to begin their new life. At one point, the teacher leans over in his seat to plant a kiss on his wife's cheek. The couple had been together for 16 years and got married in 2003.

Although he was aware of the dangers, particularly as a U.S. citizen, Mr Smith drew strength from his faith and the difference that he could make in his students' lives.

He said: 'No matter what happens, I'm good. That gives me peace, and I'm OK with that.'

The chemistry teacher also served as a deacon at the Austin Stone Community Church which is described on its website as a New Testament Church.

Mr Smith's commitment to his life in Benghazi and the people he met, has been reflected in the hundreds of messages posted on social media in the wake of his death. The chemistry teacher described himself as 'Libya's best friend' on his Twitter account.

Mr Smith's students tweeted emotional tributes to their chemistry teacher with the tag #ThankYouSmith. Sara wrote: '#ThankYouSmith for being a great teacher and an amazing friend.'

The
teacher was jogging in an area close to the U.S. Consulate when he was killed.

The U.S. ambassador to Libya 
Christopher
Stevens and three other Americans were killed on September 11, 2012 
when Islamist militants assaulted the consulate in Benghazi.

He was shot in the central Al-Fwihet 
neighborhood then brought to Benghazi Medical Center where 
he was pronounced dead of gunshot wounds. 

'He was doing his morning exercise when gunmen just shot him. I don't 
know why. He was so sweet with everyone,' said Adel al Mansouri, 
director of International School Benghazi. 

The director added: ''He 
loved being in Benghazi and he loved Libya and the kindness of its 
people.'

Mr al Mansouri said that the teacher had been looking forward to going home for Christmas to see his family. 

Mr Smith was a dedicated teacher and had stayed on in Libya to see his students through their midterms while his family went to the U.S. for the holidays

Student Yomna Zentani, 18, told NBC: 'He was going back home to see his mom and his family where he hadn’t been for some time.

In the latest government advice, dated June 7, 2013, U.S. citizens are strongly advised against all but essential travel to Tripoli - and all travel to Benghazi, Bani Walid and southern Libya.   

The State Department writes: 'The security situation in Libya remains unpredictable.

'Sporadic episodes of civil unrest have occurred throughout the country. U.S. citizens should avoid areas of demonstrations and exercise caution if in the vicinity of any large gatherings, protests, or demonstrations, as even demonstrations intended to be peaceful can turn confrontational and escalate into violence.

'U.S. citizens traveling to, or remaining in, Libya should use caution and limit nonessential travel within the country, make their own contingency emergency plans, and maintain security awareness at all times.'

'He was supposed to leave this week but he said he would stay around for our midterms and sent his family. He was going to join them.'     

The teacher's death comes just days after al-Qaeda's American spokesman called for Libyans to 'stand up for revenge' on America after U.S. special forces snatched an al-Qaeda suspect from the streets of Tripoli.

Adam Gadahn, a former Osama bin Laden spokesman, says the kidnapping of Abu Anas al-Libi from Libya is a crime of piracy, urging Libyans to attack U.S. interests everywhere.

Gadahn
released an audio speech to militant websites last Saturday saying that
al-Libi had no role in the 1998 bombings of two U.S. embassies in 
Africa because he had left al-Qaeda and formed a new group.

U.S.
special forces snatched al-Libi in October and detained him on a U.S. 
warship before bringing him to the U.S. to stand trial.

'The
kidnapping is a new episode in a series of U.S. crimes of piracy,' 
Gadahn said, urging Libyans to 'stand up for revenge' and attack U.S. 
foreign and domestic interests.

Similar
calls were made by al Qaeda chiefs in the days running up to the 2012 attack on the U.S. Consulate which claimed the life
of Ambassador Stevens.

Three other Americans - Sean Smith, Tyron Woods 
and Glen Doherty - also perished in the assault.

The State Department's deputy 
spokesperson Marie Harf said on Thursday: 'We can confirm that a U.S. 
citizen was shot and killed in Benghazi. We offer our condolences to the
victim’s loved ones.

'We are in contact with the family and are providing all appropriate consular assistance.

'Out
of respect for the privacy of those affected, we have no further 
comment at this time. For questions on the investigation, I refer you to
the Libyan authorities.'

Benghazi has become a flashpoint for violence in Libya with the city at the heart of the 2011 revolution against leader Muammar Gaddafi.

Libyan special forces have been battling
militants from Ansar al-Sharia, the group that U.S. officials blame for attacking the U.S. consulate in the eastern city in September 
2012.

Security sources said three soldiers were also killed in separate attacks on Thursday in Benghazi.

Two years after a NATO-backed uprising ousted veteran leader Gaddafi, Libya's armed forces are struggling to contain militias, former fighters and Islamist militants who control parts of the vast oil-producing country.
