Two women and a 15-year-old girl left a man scarred for life after carrying out a brutal attack during which he had boiling water poured over him.

Tamlyn Stanhope, 33, Keeley Brewer, 18, and a teenager who can't be named for legal reasons, laughed and joked as they kicked and stamped on terrified victim Simon Christian, a court heard.

The 35-minute torture session was even filmed on a mobile phone by mother-of-two Brewer who later bragged in a text message that the abuse was 'too funny'.

Mr Christian, who had previously been a friend of Stanhope's, spent three weeks in a specialist burns unit and was left with lacerations to his head as well as badly burned, raw and peeling skin.

Stanhope, from Popley, and Brewer, from Basingstoke, pleaded guilty to causing grievious bodily harm with intent.

They were jailed for eight and seven years respectively.

The 15-year-old also pleaded guilty to the charge and
will be sentenced at a later date.

Winchester Crown Court heard how Mr Christian, 29, had visited Stanhope's home in July this year before an argument broke out.

Victim: Simon Christian suffered severe burns in the attack

The pair stamped on their victim and kicked him before hitting him over the head with a fryer.

Rob Welling, prosecuting, said Mr Christian had been tortured by Brewer and Stanhope for a ‘period of considerable time.’

He said: 'Each took different roles and each understood and recognised what the other was doing.

'Over a period of considerable time, 
they tortured Simon Christian to the point where they ended up pouring 
boiling water over him on a number of occasions where he was in no 
position to defend himself.'

Neighbours heard the attack and one reported hearing the victim plead: ‘Please don’t burn me again.’

When police officers arrived they found Mr Christian in a ‘dishevelled state’ and covered in blood.

The court heard Brewer later sent text messages in which she bragged about the abuse, saying it was ‘too funny.’

She also received a text advising her to clean up the evidence, to which she responded ‘blood’s gone and I don’t think he will remember.’

Adrienne Knight, defending Stanhope, 
said her client believed Mr Christian had tried to steal money and she 
asked him to leave, but he had refused.

Both defendants claimed that Mr Christian had behaved in a provocative way, including urinating at the front door.

Defending Brewer, Karen Dempsey claimed that Mr Christian had ‘pinned down’ the 15-year-old on a bed upstairs.

Permanently scarred: Victim Simon Christian was left with horrific 
injuries after having boiling water poured on him during the attack by 
Stanhope, Brewer and a 15-year-old girl

Sentencing the women, Judge Paul Burrell said Stanhope had lashed out to ‘get justice’ and ‘humiliate’ Mr Christian after a ‘certain amount of non-violent provocation.’

He added: 'You opened the door and launched a ferocious and cruel attack. All three of you lost control.

'The pouring of boiling water was quite horrific. Simon Christian could easily have died.'

Mr Christian, who is in a relationship with 20-year-old Ellie Wilks, is now coming to terms with his life-changing injuries.

The
father-of-one will not be allowed out in the sun for two years because 
of the scarring and he is awaiting keyhole surgery on his wrist, which 
was broken. He is also seeing a phychiatrist.

Speaking after the case, he said: 'I have broken both my legs before and my back, and I would rather go through that again than being burned.

'It’s a whole different type of pain. The burns were a couple of centimetres away from my eyes and that was a scary thought.'

He explained he had been drinking with Stanhope, who considered a good friend, before the attack and had been invited back to her house.

Things turned ‘nasty’ following an argument, but he denied claims that he provoked them in any way.

He said: 'I’m not a violent person. I’m not big enough to be violent.'

Jailed: Tamlyn Stanhope and Keeley Brewer were locked up for eight and seven years respectively by a judge at Winchester Crown Court
