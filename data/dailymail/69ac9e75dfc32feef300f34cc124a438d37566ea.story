David Beckham is set to lead a campaign to stop the spread of the deadly Ebola virus in Africa.

As part of his role as a Unicef ambassador, the former England captain will appear in a video which highlights ways to prevent the spread of the virus and will be broadcast across West Africa.

The 39-year-old will explain how cleanliness is crucial in controlling the epidemic in Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea as the death toll rises to 4,033.

David Beckham is set to lead a campaign to help stop the spread of the deadly Ebola virus by starring in a video

His role in the outbreak was revealed by Sierra Leone Football Association president Isha Johansen to the Sun on Sunday.

She said: 'To have David Beckham involved in this campaign is massive for us and we are so grateful to him. In Sierra Leone football is a religion.

'All men, women and children follow a player or a team from the Premier League but David Beckham is the favourite.' 

It comes as the Confederation of African Football said it had 'registered' concerns about the  African Nations Cup tournament taking place in Morocco in January and February 2015.

The footballer visited Freetown in Sierra Leone where he met with children and played a roadside football game

As part of his role as a Unicef ambassador he went to a therapeutic feeding centre in the town of Makeni in Sierra Leone - one of the areas now worst affected by the deadly Ebola outbreak

Mrs Johansen added: 'Out country and the whole of West Africa is facing a terrible plight and the numbers who are dying are incredible.'

The football star visited Makeni in Sierra Leone in 2008 - one of the areas worst affected by the virus. Many of the victims in the town have been young children.

Beckham also met with players from Mrs Johansen's football club - FC Johansen - based in the capital Freetown during the visit.

Discussions surrounding the African Nations Cup are due to be discussed at a meeting next month.

Officials said they had taken into account 'health risks posed by the Ebola virus'.

Meanwhile a female nurse from Texas who treated America's Ebola 'patient zero' became the second person in the country to test positive for the deadly virus today.

Writing for the The New York Times, Michael Osterholm, the director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy a the University of Minnesota, said those experts are loath to discuss their concerns in public, for fear of whipping up hysteria. 

Discussing the possible future course of the current outbreak, he said: 'The second possibility is one that virologists are loath to discuss openly but are definitely considering in private: that an Ebola virus could mutate to become transmissible through the air.'  

But the chair of the UK's Health Protection Agency, Professor David Heymann of the London School of Hygiene of Tropical Medicine, said it is impossible to predict how any virus will mutate.

He said scientists across the world do not know enough about genetics to be able to say how the Ebola virus will change over time.

Pointing to the example of the H1N1 influenza virus that saw bird flu sweep the globe in 2009, Dr Osterholm said: 'If certain mutations occurred, it would mean that just breathing would put one at risk of contracting Ebola.' 

But Professor Heymann, told MailOnline: 'No one can predict what will happen with the mutation of the virus.

'I would like to see the evidence that this could become a respiratory virus.

'The virus's epidemiology is consistent with transmission via bodily secretions and excretions, which is exactly the same as other past epidemics.
