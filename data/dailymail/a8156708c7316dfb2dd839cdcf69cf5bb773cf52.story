Although she seemed to have opted for tousled hair to suit the laid-back Australian atmosphere of late, today on day nine of the Open, Kim's locks were straightened for the occasion.

Although her tresses appeared polished, the gusts of wind saw her left with tangles in her hair as she was blasted while she watched the match. 

Kim appeared nervous at the beginning of the match but that quickly turned to excitement as Andy, 27, stormed into the semi-finals after a dominant straight set 6-3, 7-3, 6-3 defeat of the local favourite Kygrios.

Beaming with pride for her partner Kim clapped her hands and cheered many times throughout the match, putting her engagement ring - believed to be valued around £200,000 - on display. 

She scored her extravagant bling back in November after Andy, currently the world's No. 6 ranked tennis player, proposed.

Experts said that Andy, who's estimated to have earned £11.5million last year alone, had picked out a ‘perfect statement ring’ for Kim, 27, who has been a constant courtside presence during his career.

Diamond jeweller Lewis Malka said that the ring, bought by Andy, who's estimated to have a fortune of roughly £30million. said the ring appears to be a three-carat diamond surrounded by smaller stones.

Kim and Andy have been dating for nine years, and live in a £5.6million home in Oxshott, Surrey, are planning their wedding for next autumn, according to Murray’s mother Judy.

They met in 2005 when 17-year-old Kim was at a tennis championship with her father Nigel, a coach.
