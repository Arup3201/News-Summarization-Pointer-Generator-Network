A Channel 7 tennis commentator has caused outrage at the Australian Open after asking Canadian tennis star Eugenie Bouchard to ‘twirl’ on live TV.

The 20-year-old was stunned as she was asked by commentator Ian Cohen  during her post-match interview: ‘Can you give us a twirl?’. 

Bouchard had just won an impressive 6-0, 6-3 match against Kiki Bertens of the Netherlands in just 54 minutes at Melbourne Park.

Channel 7 distanced themselves from the interview when contacted by Daily Mail Australia, saying that Cohen was 'working For Tennis Australia'. 

Responding to the unusual request which has been slammed on social media and in the international press, including her native Canada, as ‘sexist’, Bouchard said: ‘A twirl, like a pirouette, here you go.’

The shocked Canadian laughed, twirled and then covered her face with her hands before waving at the cheering audience.

Cohen made the request for a twirl after he noticed Bouchard had commented about Serena William’s Australian Open outfit on Twitter.

‘Last night you tweeted that you loved Serena’s outfit. Obviously the fluoro is working for you girls at the moment. She was kind enough to give us a twirl, can you give us a twirl and tell us about your outfit,’ he said.

After twirling, Bouchard awkwardly noted: 'I mean I have to say I think Serena's outfit is the best, even better than mine, I have to give her that.’

Last year Bouchard, when was asked at the Australian Open who her dream date was, she replied: 'Justin Bieber'.

Bouchard has achieved the highest world ranking ever for a Canadian player

The 20-year-old is considered the next big star in women’s tennis and broke into the top 10 for the first time last year after reaching the finals at Wimbledon

The No. 7-ranked player, who described herself as a ‘perfectionist’, later spoke about the unusual incident at a press conference, calling it ‘very unexpected.’

‘I don't know, an old guy asking you to twirl. It was funny,’ she added.

A Channel 7 spokesperson told Daily Mail Australia: 'The interview, which didn’t air on Channel 7 or 7TWO, was in this instance conducted by a commentator who works for the host broadcaster, Tennis Australia.

'The host broadcaster provides match coverage and some commentary and interviews, which is seen on our live digital streaming service.'

Cohen was clearly holding a Channel 7 microphone and the interview appeared on Channel 7's sport website featuring their logo.

Bouchard has achieved the highest world ranking ever for a Canadian player and is considered the next big star in women’s tennis.

She broke into the top 10 for the first time last year after reaching the finals at Wimbledon, where she lost to Petra Kvitova but became the first Canadian to appear in a Grand Slam final.

Bouchard has 25 wins and seven losses in majors and is playing in just her eighth Grand Slam event.

Canadian journalist Signa Butler said: ‘Can we expect Federer to be asked same question?'

Twitter user Val showed her confusion over the twirling request calling it 'disrespectful and pervy'

After the twirling incident, one shocked tennis fan on Twitter, Marsha Boyd, wrote: ‘We need more people to stand up against sexism. No one is asking @rogerfederer to twirl. Don't ask @geniebouchard!’

Val Andrea Way commented: ‘What the?? Would he have asked a Male pro tennis player to "give us a twirl"?? How disrespectful and well pervy.’

‘Male presenter at @AustralianOpen asks professional female tennis player @geniebouchard after win to "give us a twirl". WTF?,’ Meg said on the social media site.

And Canadian journalist Signa Butler said: ‘Can we expect Federer to be asked same question? Pathetic. On-court presenter asks Eugenie Bouchard to “twirl”.’
