Every day, thousands of people are joining are uploading videos of their attempt at the ice bucket challenge to join the social media craze. 

But with so many clips dominating Facebook feeds, users are thinking of ways to stand out.

So when mechanic Colin Meyrick received his nomination, he decided to ditch the ice - and instead opted for engine oil.

Different method: Colin Meyrick, 46, from Llanhilleth, Wales, agreed to have 30 litres of engine oil poured over him at Cooper Car Sales in Ystrad Mynach, in a bid to raise money for Macmillan Cancer Support

The 46-year-old from Llanhilleth, South Wales, agreed to have 30 litres of the liquid poured over his head on one condition - all the money raised would go to a cancer charity in memory of his late mother. 

Within hours of thinking up the idea in the pub, Mr Meyrick and his colleagues at Coopers Car Sales in Ystrad Mynach had already raised more than £1,000.

Garage owner Lewis Phillips said: 'We were in the pub talking about the craze and Colin made a throwaway comment that he'd do it with car oil.

'I said to him 'I'll give you £300 if you do it' and he said he would, as long as the money goes to Macmillan Cancer Support.

'His mum Maver Meyrick passed away earlier this year after a long-term battle with cancer so he wanted to raise money for that cause.

'We already had £700 by the time we left the first pub, Redz in Bargoed, as there was an 18th birthday party in the back room.

Soaked: Mr Meyrick jokingly said he would use engine oil instead of ice at the pub, with his friends jumping on the idea. Within hours they had already raised more than £1,000

'On the same night we moved on to the Neuadd Wen in Aberbargoed, the Railway Inn in Abertillery and the Top Hotel in Llanhilleth. By the time we got home we'd already raised £1,100 in sponsorship.'

The total amount raised has now topped £1,200 and representatives from Macmillan will be visiting the garage on Monday to collect the cash.

Mr Phillips added: 'The sponsorship support was phenomenal, everyone wanted to donate. Colin spends most of the day covered in oil anyway so it wasn't that different for him after the challenge.

'He took it in good spirits and was back in the pub again within the hour. He's chuffed to have raised that much money.

'We are so grateful for the support and would particularly like to thank Bodyshine Repair Centre, TG Car Sales, Albion Repair Centre and Pengam Partmart.'
