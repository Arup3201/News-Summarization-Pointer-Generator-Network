A woman has been arrested today on suspicion of murdering her own mother in the riverside home they shared.

Neighbours called police after hearing a disturbance inside the second floor flat on the bank of the River Thames in Oxford.

The dead womanâ€™s daughter, aged 29, was then arrested and is currently being questioned by police.

Crime scene: Neighbours called police about a disturbance at the second-floor property in Friars Wharf, Oxford, where the mother and daughter are believed to have lived together

Police received a 999 call raising concerns about the welfare of the owner of the flat in Friars Wharf, based in the heart of Oxford city centre, just before 8am this morning.

A police spokesman said that officers were in the early stages of an investigation and that the death was being treated as murder.

He said: 'Police were called to a property in Friars Wharf at around 7.45am today following concerns for the welfare of an occupant at the property.

'Officers attended and discovered the body of a woman who is believed to be in her 50s.'

Murder investigation: Forensic teams cordoned off the flat where the body of the woman in her 50s was found

Taped off: Detectives were making house-to-house enquiries after discovering the body

He added: 'A 29-year-old woman was arrested at the address on suspicion of murder.'

On guard: A police officer stands outside the property while forensic teams work inside

It is understood that the pair at the centre of the investigation lived together and were mother and daughter.

Detectives have not named the dead woman while they contact the next of kin.

A post-mortem examination is expected to take place in due course to determine how she died.

The second floor flat was cordoned off by detectives today and forensic scenes of crime officers were seen entering the property.

Detectives were seen making house-to-house enquiries as part of the murder investigation while a large tarpaulin sheet was erected at the front of the property whilst forensic officers worked.

Detective Chief Inspector Vince Grey of Thames Valley Police said: 'We are clearly at the very early stages of our investigation and there are not further details available at this stage about how the victim died.

'We have someone in custody and we are not looking for anyone else at this time.'

A post-mortem examination will be carried out shortly to establish the cause of death.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
