Fight to the Finnish? The Nokia Lumia 900 was meant to be the Finnish phone makers triumphant return to the smartphone market - but Nokia has been forced to cut its price by half just weeks after launch

It was hailed as the phone with which Nokia would finally challenge the dominance of the iPhone and Galaxy S.

But the Finnish phone maker has been forced to cut the price of its Lumia 900 by half just weeks after launch.

The cost of the Lumia 900 Windows phone 
in the US has now been reduced to $49.99 from $99 with a two-year contract, Nokia spokesman Keith Nowak said on Sunday.

After being the main player in the mobile market for the best part of a decade, Nokia has failed to produce a smartphone to compete with those from rivals such as Apple, Samsung and HTC.

The company was criticised for being late to embrace smartphones and has been lagging 
behind ever since. It has also been losing market share in less 
expensive mobile phones.

So its alliance with Microsoft - the phones run Windows software - was meant to rejuvenate the company. But it has failed to capture the public imagination so far.

Nokia's phone is sold at AT&T Inc stores.Nowak said the price cut 'is part of our ongoing lifecycle management, which is jointly done between Nokia and carrier customers'.

Featuring a 4.3-inch screen, 1.4-gigahertz processor and 8-megapixel camera, the Lumia 900 uses largely untried software from Microsoft Corp.

Sales have been slow, and Nokia took a further hit when Microsoft said current phones will be unable to run its new Windows 8 software, rendering them obsolete.

Last month, Nokia said it would cut 10,000 jobs, and that its handset business would post a larger-than-expected quarterly loss. All three major credit rating agencies have downgraded Nokia to 'junk' status.

Smartphones using Google Inc's Android system are expected to comprise 61 per cent of the global market in 2012, while Apple's iPhone could capture more than 20 per cent, International Data Corp said last month.

Nokia is expected to report second-quarter results on July 19.

Shares of Nokia closed on Friday at 1.51 euros, after earlier in the week falling to their lowest since the mid-1990s.

Nokia is to cut 10,000 jobs worldwide by the end of next year as it fights fierce competition in the smartphone market.

Nokia's Lumia's are an alliance between Nokia and 
Microsoft - the touchscreen phone runs Microsoft's simple, 
good-looking Windows Phone 7 software.

Both companies are relying on Lumia to catapult them back into competition with rivals iPhone and Android.

So far, Microsoft's Windows software has failed to make an impact, and Nokia's market share has been steadily dwindling.

When
current CEO Stephen Elop took over the company, he likened Nokia's 
situation to a man standing on a 'burning oil platform' - with the 
choices of staying and burning alive or leaping into the sea.

Lumia is the 'leap into the sea' - an alliance with Microsoft to propel Nokia's handsets back into the limelight. Lumia is cheaper than iPhone, and simpler than Android.

It also works with Microsoft Office documents, and has Xbox games built in.

The
design is pure high-end Nokia smartphone, with a moulded polycarbonate 
exterior and a Carl Zeiss lens that has already drawn admiring reviews 
from tech blogs.

   The Finnish mobile maker said the cuts were part of plans to ‘significantly reduce its operating expenses’ as it aims to return to profitable growth by sharpening strategy and improving its operating model.

The company warned that second-quarter loss from its phone business would be larger than expected.

Nokia said it remains focused on its smartphones and feature phones and intends to expand location-based services.

It aims to differentiate its portfolio of Lumia smartphones with location-based services including navigation and visual search applications, such as the Nokia city Lens.
