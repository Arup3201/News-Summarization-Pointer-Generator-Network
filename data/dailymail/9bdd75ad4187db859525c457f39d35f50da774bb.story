Serie A frontrunners Juventus travel to Roma in a top-of-the-table clash at the Stadio Olimpico on Monday night.

It is a chance for Massimiliano Allegri's men to edge even further ahead of the pack and increase their lead to 12 points at the summit of the Italian top flight.

However Roma will be keen for victory in front of a home crowd in order to claw back some lost ground against the Old Lady.

Paul Pogba has been in scintillating form for Juventus this term, but starts on the bench against Roma 

Juve are on a 15-game unbeaten run in Serie A, and have lost just one league game all season away to Genoa in October.

Roma on the other hand have won just twice in their last nine games, drawing seven.

Host commentator

That's it from me tonight, an entertaining contest to say the least! Thank you for joining us. 

Goodnight!

And there we have it! A fantastic comeback from Roma to earn themselves a point against Juve. Admittedly, the home side were outplayed for most of the game but their response to conceding the goal and going down to ten men must be admired. 

Juventus will be happy with the draw and keeping their nine-point gap between themselves and Roma intact.

Padoin is brought on for Lichtsteiner, who is cursing his luck as he leaves the field of play.

Risky play from Florenzi in his own half but he manages to squirm free and get Roma on an attack but it comes to nothing.

Silly, petulant tackle from the Chilean. He's been asking for that. 

Morata is replaced by Coman.

After being silenced by Tevez's free kick, the Stadio Olimpico has truly erupted since Keita's equaliser. 

The substitute goes in the book for a poor tackle.

Keita gets the leveller for the 10 men of Roma after getting on the end of Florenzi's free kick. The Malian heads in the loose ball, to send the home support into raptures.

Just 12 minutes remaining. 

This one's really getting nasty. Iturbe on the sharp end of two stinging Juventus challenges deep in the opposing half. The Argentine has really made an impact since his introduction.

Juventus rightly impressed with Tevez's magical free kick. De Sanctis could merely watch as the ball glided into his top left corner.

Garcia makes his third and final change as De Rossi makes way for Belgium international Nainggolan.

Manolas rises highest to meet a free kick from deep, forcing Buffon into his first real piece of action of the game. 

Rudi Garcia has sprung into action since the Juve goal and brings on Iturbe for Totti.

Ljajic makes way for Florenzi as the hosts look to respond. 

The Argentinian steps up to take the resulting free kick and bends one in from 25 yards. One hell of a blow for 10-man Roma. 

As Vidal is played through on the edge of the box, the Greek full back clips the heels of the Juve forward. Intentional or not, he was the last man and was rightfully dismissed. 

The Roma defender is the latest to go in the referee's book for a foul as Juve threaten to counter. Juve will be unhappy that an advantage wasn't played, but the resulting free kick leads to a wasteful cross.

The Bosnian is cautioned for a rash tackle. 

Morata fouls Yanga Mbiwa and is booked for his troubles.

Lichtsteiner shoots from distance but his shot doesn't trouble De Sanctis. The visitors are beginning to ask questions of Roma, who have started the second half rather sloppily.

Lichtsteiner shoots from distance but doesn't trouble De Sanctis. The visitors beginning to ask questions of their opponents now. Sloppy start to the second half from Roma.

Tevez breaks on the counter and slides Vidal through, but his shot goes just inches wide to the right of goal.

Chiellini is in fine form tonight. He looks almost invincible as he slides in to intercept Gervinho on the halfway line.

Yanga Mbiwa sloppily gives the ball straight to a Juventus attacker, but clears his lines with his second chance. 

Roma get the second period underway. Both sides unchanged after the half-time team talks.

Roma's Yanga Mbiwa (left) challenges Juventus striker Carlos Tevez for a header in a feisty first half at the Stadio Olimpico.

A stubborn defensive performance from Juventus in that first half. Roma with the lion's share of possession but they're finding it tricky to find holes in the Juve rearguard.

Allegri will be the happier of the two managers after the opening 45 minutes, and the pressure is on Roma to produce a goal in the second period.

Juventus find themselves in a three-on-two situation but as Tevez takes a shot at goal from the edge of the 18-yard box, his effort is deflected out for a corner that is dealt with easily by De Sanctis.

Evra is shown a yellow card for a foul on Torosidis. 

It looks like there's no way through for Roma as the visitors defend with eight men back in their own area. Gervinho's attack is broken down and the home side are forced to start again.

Flare smoke engulfs Roma's fans prior to kick off. They're up for this one tonight!

Morata gives away a free kick for a trip on former Barcelona player Keita.

De Rossi is cautioned for going through the back of Juve striker Morata. He pleads his innocence but the referee is having none of it. 

Roma skipper Totti is put under pressure from Marchisio as his side try to pick the lock to the Juve defence. So far, they've been unsuccessful.

The flares are out, the fans are in full voice and this one is set up to be quite a spectacle. The score, however, remains goalless.

Pereya delivers a cross into the Roma box and Manolas almost turns the ball into his own net under pressure from Vidal. However the Greek defender's touch dribbles just wide and out for a corner. 

Roma manage to scramble the ball clear of their crowded area as the ball is pumped forward. Torosidis is then shown the first yellow of the game for what looked like a double-footed tackle on Vidal. He'll miss the next game through suspension.

Totti getting a talking to from the referee after a tackle on Lichtsteiner. It's been a physical start to the game.

Juve looking organised in defence. Roma will need to figure out how they are going to pick their way through the visitors' back line. 

Yanga Mbiwa has Morata breathing down his neck as a loose ball bounces back towards the Roma goal, however the Frenchman clears with a swing of his right boot.

Roma trying to build up play patiently but cannot find a way through the Juve defence

Vidal shoots from the edge of the box but his shot goes just wide of De Sanctis' left post

Tevez takes a short corner but the Old Lady's attack is cut out by the home side. Wasteful from the visitors.

A drone flies overhead before kick off in the eagerly anticipated clash 

Marchisio delivers a free kick from wide on the right but it is headed clear by the Roma defence.

De Rossi lets Vidal know his intentions with a hard tackle within the first minute. Arguable could have been cautioned but he gets away with it.

Hisses from the hostile home crowd as Juve get the game started. They're in a noisy mood tonight!

Two changes from Tuesday's Champions League fixture against Borussia Dortmund as Pogba and Pirlo make way for Caceres and Pereya  

Buffon, Caceres, Bonucci, Chiellini, Evra, Lichtsteiner, Vidal, Marchisio, Pereyra, Tevez, Morata.

De Sanctis, Torosidis, Manolas, Mapou, Cholevas, Pjanic, De Rossi, Keita, Gervinho, Totti, Ljajic

Welcome to Sportsmail's live coverage of the Serie A top of the table clash between Roma and Juventus.
