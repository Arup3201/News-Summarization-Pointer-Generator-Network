She has the workload of a woman half her age.

In addition to her role as the sharp-tongued and imperious Dowager Countess of Grantham which has turned Downton Abbey into a global success, Dame Maggie Smith has also recently starred in two films: last spring’s The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel which was a surprise hit and new film Quartet.

And at the age of 78, Dame Maggie has admitted she has no intention of slowing down.

Rather she looks forward to ‘whatever other old biddy comes along’ because working fills the loneliness that engulfs her life.

Candid: In a rare interview, Dame Maggie Smith says that acting 'fills a void in her life'

In a rare interview with 60 Minutes in the US, Dame Maggie reveals that losing the love of her life, the playwright Beverley Cross, has left a void that she fills by immersing herself in a role.

Asked: ‘Is it lonely?’ She replied: ‘I don’t know. It seems a bit pointless. Going on one’s own and not having someone to share it with.’

Warming to the theme of aging she also said she didn’t like it and added: ‘I don’t know who does. Noel Coward-- and I don’t mean to name drop.

'But he said,”The awful thing about getting old is that you have breakfast every half-hour.” And that’s sort of what it is. I can’t understand why everything has to go so fast. ‘

Interviewer Steve Kroft asks her: ‘But you have no interest in finding someone else?’

Dame Maggie replies: ‘Absolutely not. I – no way’.

The actress has enjoyed a 60-year career despite early advice from her grandmother that she wasn’t pretty enough to be an actress and that she should learn to type.

She made her Broadway debut at 21 and was later recruited by Sir Laurence Olivier to join Britain’s National Theatre.

She made her name in The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie which won her an Academy Award for best actress. Dame Maggie has won two Oscars, three Emmys and a Tony award in total.

Her personal life has been just as eventful.

Dame Maggie, who was married to Cross for 23 years until his death from heart disease in 1998, initially met him when she was 18.

Despite already being married, he proposed to her and she agreed to wait. However, it was while waiting for his divorce to go through that she met Robert Stephens.

She went on to have two sons with Stephens, actors Chris Larkin, 45 and Toby Stephens, 43.

However, they split in 1973 after seven years of marriage and she married Beverley two years later.

Dame Maggie admits she enjoys spending time with her grandchildren and describes them as ‘wonderful’.

It was several years ago that the veteran star also admitted she was still struggling to come to terms with her husband’s death, saying: ‘Everybody says it gets better, but I don’t think it does. It gets different.

‘Jane Birkin’s mother Judy Campbell once said an extraordinary thing to me when her husband died; that it was a strange feeling you were not number one with anybody.

‘I have many good friends but I tend to keep to myself anyway. It’s odd, doing things and having no one to share them with.’

A breast cancer survivor, off-screen Dame Maggie admits she likes to use the f-word and accepts that she is spiky because she has high standards.

She confessed: ‘I don’t tolerate fools and they don’t tolerate me. You’re trying to say that I’m – what everybody says , they always seem to think that I’m scary. And I understand that totally. Old people are scary. And I have to face it. I am old and I am scary. And I’m very sorry about it but I don’t know what you do.’

Dame Maggie  has signed up for the fourth series of Downton Abbey, which is currently being filmed and admits she will just keep going until the end.

She said: ‘I think that the date for that [retiring] has gone by. I fear that I won’t work in the theatre again. I’m sad about that. But I won’t retire. I think I’ll keep going with Violet and whatever other old biddy comes along.’
