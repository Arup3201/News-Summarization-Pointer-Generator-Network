Add former U.S. Vice President Dick Cheney to the chorus of Republicans who seem insistent on making the 2012 terror attack in Benghazi, Libya a black mark against Hillary Rodham Clinton if she decides to run for president.

In an interview taped for Fox News Sunday, Cheney told host Chris Wallace that the former Secretary of State will have some explaining to do.

'She was Secretary of State at the time that it happened,' Cheney said in an excerpt broadcast Friday afternoon on Fox.

'She was one of the first in Washington to know about it.'

'I think she clearly bears responsibility for whatever the State Department did or didn't do with respect to that – uh, that crisis.'

Former U.S. Vice President Dick Cheney, shown in a May 12 interview, vented his spleen about Hillary Clinton's role in the Benghazi scandal during a Fox News interview that will air Sunday

Clinton, then secretary of state, angered members of the U.S. Senate in 2013 when she suggested it made no difference whether the 2012 attack that claimed four U.S. lives was premeditated or spontaneous

The U.S. diplomatic compound in Benghazi, LIbya erupted in flames on September 11, 2012 after heavily armed terrorists linked to an al-Qaeda affiliate group launched mortars and grenades and followed up with small-arms fire

'I do think it's a major issue,' the former vice president and one-time Secretary of Defense added. 'I don't think we've heard the last of it yet.'

Clinton, President Barack Obama and other administration officials famously insisted in the days following the September 11, 2012 attack that it was not premeditated but improvised, the product of a spontaneous protest against a crude Internet video that lampooned the Muslim prophet Muhammad.

That claim has been proven false, with the only remaining question being who proposed it in the first place.

But Clinton's political liabilities also extend to her State Departments failure to protect its diplomatic installation in the eastern Libya port city.

Months before Ansar al-Shariah militants stormed the American compound, the group and other al-Qaeda affiliates paraded through central Benghazi, armed to the teeth with heavy artillery and armored vehicles, and threatened future assassinations of U.S. targets.

Despite having intelligence about that event and the press conference that followed, the State Department declined repeated requests for added security forces.

Clinton, who has insisted for more than a year that she's on the fence about a White House run in 2016, has sounded more and more like a candidate in recent weeks.

On Friday she borrowed a book full of pages from populist democrats like Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, telling an audience at the left-leaning New America Foundation that President Barack Obama's emphasis on 'income inequality' will continue to be a major focus for her.

'The dream of upward mobility that made this country a model for the world feels further and further out of reach,' she said, 'and many Americans understandably feel frustrated, even angry.'

'As secretary of state,' Clinton assured a friendly crowd, 'I saw the way extreme inequality has corrupted other societies, hobbled growth and left entire generations alienated and unmoored.'

But the words 'Benghazi' and 'Libya' never came up.

The 
Islamist terror attack, which claimed the lives of U.S. Ambassador to 
Libya Christopher Stevens and three other U.S. personnel, threatens to 
become an albatross around Clinton's neck as the decision point 
approaches for the Democratic presidential primary season.

She
 has publicly said twice this year that the Benghazi episode is her 
'biggest regret' from her years helming the State Department – first 
during a January Q-and-A session at the National Automobile Dealers 
Association convention in San Francisco, and then in April during a 
women's leadership conference at Simmons College

Not talking: Clinton is grooming her softer side for a presidential run with appearances like Friday's farewell broadcast for Barbara Walters on 'The View,' but she's not addressing her State Department's shortcomings before, during and after the terror attack

Chris Wallace, host of Fox News Sunday, interviewed Dick Cheney and his wife Lynne for Sunday's broadcast

On April 23 she discussed 'the attack on our facility in Benghazi, and the loss of, uh, two State Department personnel and two CIA contractors from the terrorist attack and the terrible consequences of that.'

'It's very, very painful and it was certainly the biggest regret that I had as Secretary of State,' Clinton said.

Secretary of explaining things: Former President Bill Clinton has rushed to his wife's aid on the Benghazi question, perhaps anticipating at least 4 more years in the White House

'They weren't the only people that we lost, but we lost them in such a terrible, senseless, terrorist action that – you know, it's just deeply sorrowful and it went on for hours – because the CIA annex was attacked after the State Department facility was attacked.'

Her emotional, contrite language stood in stark contrast with an almost flippant anger during a Senate Foreign Affairs Committee hearing 15 months earlier.

'The fact is we had four dead Americans,' she barked in a moment destined to be memorialized in campaign attack ads if she runs in 2016.

'Was it because of a protest, or was it because of guys out for a walk one night who decided that they'd they go kill some Americans? What difference, at this point, does it make?' she asked then.

Clinton's potential Republican presidential adversaries have already staked out their criticisms.

On May 9 at the Republican National Committee's spring meeting in Memphis, Tenn., Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul test fired his heavy guns.

'This is about judgment,' he said. 'And we're talking about – should we, should we as a country have a commander-in-chief who didn't provide adequate security in Libya, didn't send reinforcements, and then gave us nothing but spin?'

'My opinion is that Hillary Clinton has precluded herself from ever being considered for that position,' Paul added, to strong applause.

Mrs. Clinton's husband, former President Bill Clinton, has begun to defend her in public as it seems clear that she will have to confront the Benghazi issue if she stays in politics.

On May 14 the man President Obama once joked about appointing as his 'Secretary of Explaining Things,' said during a fiscal summit that 'In my opinion, Hillary did what she should have done' as the terror attack unfolded.

'Secretaries of state never were involved directly in these security decisions,' he insisted.

And, throwing an elbow at George W. Bush, the man who succeeded him in the Oval Office, Clinton said that 'most Americans don’t even know how many American diplomatic personnel were killed while President Bush was president.'
