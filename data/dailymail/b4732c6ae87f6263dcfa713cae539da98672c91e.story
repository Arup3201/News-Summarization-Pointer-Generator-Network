A Colorado mother accused of shooting dead her 9-year-old son in a murder-suicide attempt has been sentenced to 40 years in prison after pleading guilty to second-degree murder.

Lisa Lesyshen, 47, broke down in tears and answered Judge Michael O'Hara through sobs as she entered her plea Monday in Denver.

Lesyshen was left paralyzed after shooting Asher Lesyshen-Kirlan and then herself May 29, 2013, at their home south of Steamboat Springs.

Justice for Asher: Lisa Lesyshen, 47, pleaded guilty and was immediately sentenced to 40 years in prison Monday for killing her 9-year-old son, Asher, in a bugled murder-suicide plot last spring

She earlier pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity to first-degree murder, child abuse resulting in death and domestic violence. Steamboat Today first reported that she intended to change her plea.

'I would imagine that the punishment you experience every day pales to the punishment' called for by the court, O'Hara told her.

‘After consulting with the victim’s family and the investigating agencies, I concluded that this agreement was the best way to bring this tragic case to a close,’ District Attorney Brett Barkey stated in a press release. ‘Our hope is that this outcome brings some measure of justice to Asher and his family.’ 

Lesyshen's husband, Michael Kirlan, declined to speak at the hearing but afterward said he was satisfied with the sentence and glad there would be no trial. 

During Lesyshen's preliminary hearing, Kirlan testified that he awoke to gunshots the morning of the shooting, which came two days after his wife discovered he was having an affair, Steamboat Today reported.

He said Lisa Lesyshen was worried he was going to abandon his financial obligations to her and their son, which he said he never intended to do.

Lesyshen has been jailed in Denver and attended court hearings there because of her special medical needs. 

As she wheeled herself out of the courtroom after sentencing Monday, Mrs Lesyshen was seen mouthing the words, 'I love you,' to her parents and brother sitting in the audience, according to CBS Denver.  

According to court documents, Lisa Lesyshen entered her son's room at around 3am on the morning of May 29, 2013, and shot the boy five times in the head, leg and chest as he slept.

The boy's father, Michael Kirlan, was awakened by gunfire and ran to Asher's room, where he came face to face with his wife, who told him, 'I don't know what just happened in there.' 

When Kirlan saw his son bleeding on the bed, he called out to Lisa asking why she did it. She replied, 'to hurt you,'Waterloo Cedar Falls Courier reported at the time. She then entered her bedroom, and moments later another gunshot rang out.

Kirlan called 911 saying his son had been shot and that Lisa Lesyshen had a gun and was telling him to kill her.

Deputies arriving at the Routt County home found Lesyshen wounded in the neck and her nine-year-old son dead.

The mother left a note for her estranged husband that read, 'Remember you are responsible for what has happened here and you are the person that caused it.' The letter was signed, 'Lisa and Asher.' 

After his wife’s sentencing Monday, Michael Kirlan told reporters assembled for a press conference that he was ‘relieved’ by the outcome of the case.

Broken family: Lisa Lesyshen's parents sat somberly in the audience during the sentencing Monday 

‘I'm very happy that the community and everyone involved did not have to go through a trial, including Lisa,’ a somber Mr Kirlan said. ‘It allows myself and some others to try to move forward with our lives instead of waiting.’

When asked about his wife's motivation on that fateful morning last May, Kirlan told reporters he did not know what was in Lisa’s mind; he added that while she was not insane, his wife was not thinking clearly when she killed their son.

Asher’s paternal grandmother, Marianne Kirlan, rejected the idea that Lesyshen’s sentencing will bring her closure.

‘We lost something very precious to us, and it is easy to say “closure,” but I don’t know how anybody can. You never forget him,’ the grieving grandmother said.

Last goodbye: Lesyshen, who was left paralyzed by a self-inflicted gunshot, mouthed the words 'I love you' to her family as she wheeled herself out of the courtroom
