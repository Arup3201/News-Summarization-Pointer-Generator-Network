U.S. President Barack Obama refused to answer questions about the beleaguered Obamacare website as he walked to church with this family this morning.

The Obamas attended the 11am service at St. John's Church Lafayette Square, an Episcopal congregation, about a block from the White House, The Hill reported.

When a reporter asked if the 
troubled Healthcare.gov website will be fixed by November 30, Obama responded: 'C'mon guys, I'm going to church'.

Family outing: The Obamas attended mass at St John's Church in Washington, DC on Sunday

Obama is not an overtly religious man. He and his family rarely attend church, and he almost never elaborates in public about his own relationship to his Christian faith.

But far away from the public eye, his longtime advisers say, the president has carefully nurtured a sense of spirituality that has served as a grounding mechanism during turbulent times, when the obstacles to governing a deeply divided nation seem nearly insurmountable.

Every year on August 4, the president's birthday, Obama convenes a group of pastors by phone to receive their prayers for him for the year to come.

During the most challenging of times, prayer circles are organized with prominent religious figures such as megachurch pastor Joel Hunter, Bishop Vashti McKenzie of the African Methodist Episcopal Church and the Reverend Joseph Lowery, a civil rights activist.

And each morning for the past five 
years, before most of his aides even arrive at the White House, Obama 
has read a devotional written for him and sent to his BlackBerry, 
weaving together biblical scripture with reflections from literary 
figures like Maya Angelou and C.S. Lewis.

'I've
 certainly seen the president's faith grow in his time in office,' said 
Joshua DuBois, an informal spiritual adviser to Obama who writes the 
devotionals and ran Obama's faith-based office until earlier this year. 'When you cultivate your faith, it grows.'

Obama
 is particularly moved by theories that draw connections between 
biblical themes and the personal journeys of historical figures like 
Abraham Lincoln and Martin Luther King Jr., DuBois said.

He added that 
the president's spiritual strength is his belief that God will carry him
 through to see another day â€” even amid crises like the 
debt-and-spending debacle that's ensnared Washington for the last month.

'Because
 of these grounding aspects of his life, he doesn't let the day-to-day 
challenges really shake him,' said DuBois, a former associate pastor at a
 Pentecostal church.

Spiritual guide: Joshua DuBois is President Barack Obama's 'Pastor-in-Chief'

The image of Obama as someone who draws heavily on faith to guide his daily life contrasts with his public persona. An
 intensely private person, Obama has shied away from all but the most 
general descriptions of his spiritual life.

After all, Obama had to 
distance himself from his longtime pastor, the Reverend Jeremiah Wright, 
when his anti-American rantings threatened Obama's 2008 presidential 
campaign. And persistent, false claims that Obama is secretly a Muslim 
have followed him even into his second term.

'Sometimes
 I search scripture to determine how best to balance life as a president
 and as a husband and as a father,' Obama said in February at the 
National Prayer Breakfast. 'I often search for scripture to figure out 
how I can be a better man as well as a better president.'

The
 best clues to which texts fortify Obama's spiritual consumption may 
come from the daily devotionals that DuBois started sending Obama, then a
 U.S. senator, in 2008. DuBois ran religious outreach for Obama's 
presidential campaign that year, and his digital benedictions for Obama 
have been compiled in a forthcoming book, 'The President's Devotional'.

'A snippet of scripture for me to reflect on,' Obama has said. 'And it has meant the world to me.'

At
 pivotal moments in Obama's presidency, DuBois sometimes selects texts 
that offer lessons apropos of the challenges at hand. Before one State 
of the Union address, it was the words of Isaiah, in an appeal for 
clarity of speech: 'So shall my word be that goes out from my mouth, it 
shall not return to me empty, but it shall accomplish that which I 
purpose.'

Others are intended as an oasis from the worldly conflicts Obama has to weather on any given day.

'We
 are hard pressed on every side, but not crushed. Perplexed, but not in 
despair,' reads a verse from 2 Corinthians that DuBois sent Obama one 
November, followed with his own meditation: 'Dear God, give us a 
resilient spirit, a spirit that returns to face this day even in the 
shadow of yesterday's challenges. Help us, today, to bounce back.'

In
 his final years in office, Obama plans to continue with the morning 
meditations, the birthday call with pastors and ad hoc prayer circles, 
said a senior administration official, who wasn't authorized to comment 
by name on Obama's spiritual life and requested anonymity.

Privately,
 Obama also speaks to staff of being mindful of his own spiritual 
responsibility to the nation, the official said. In times of crisis, 
from devastating hurricanes to tragic school shootings, many Americans 
look to their president as a source of strength and comfort.

'This
 office tends to make a person pray more,' Obama said last year in an 
interview with Cathedral Age magazine. 'And as President Lincoln once 
said, 'I have been driven to my knees many times by the overwhelming 
conviction that I had no place else to go.'
