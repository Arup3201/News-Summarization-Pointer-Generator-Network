Tragic: Michael Tigue, 15, has been charged as an adult with first-degree murder in the stabbing death of 25-year-old Steven Tigue, pictured. He is being held  on $2 million bond Sunday

An Illinois teen is accused of plotting and carrying out the brutal murder of his older brother as revenge for bullying.

Michael Tigue, 15, has been charged as an adult with first-degree murder in the stabbing death of 25-year-old Steven Tigue. He was ordered held on $2 million bond Sunday.

Officers were called to the Tigue family's home in the quiet village of Flossmoor at around 1 a.m. Friday after a report of a domestic disturbance and when they arrived discovered Steven with multiple stab wounds.

He was rushed to South Suburban 
Hospital in Hazel Crest, where he was pronounced dead at 1:38 a.m., 
according to the Cook County Medical Examiner's office.

An
 autopsy conducted Friday revealed the death was a homicide, 
making it the first murder in Flossmoor in more than three decades, police said.

Michael Tigue was identified as a possible suspect at the scene, and he was
taken into custody, police said. He was charged Friday 
afternoon.

Tigue appeared in bond court Saturday, where Cook County Judge James Brown set bond at $2 million.

At a bond hearing Sunday, Assistant 
State's Attorney Shawn Abraham said the teen had confessed to plotting 
the murder of his brother and claimed bullying drove him to do it.

'The defendant indicated (he'd been the victim of) prior bullying and later admitted to planning the attack,' he said.

The
 younger Tigue allegedly waited for his brother to get home in an 
upstairs bedroom. When he arrived, Michael began to attack Steven with a 
golf club, the Chicago Sun Times reported.

The older brother then wrestled the club away from his younger sibling, but Michael pulled out a kitchen knife and began stabbing his brother in the chest, prosecutors said.

The boys' mother, Patricia Tigue, heard the fight and broke it up before telling Michael to call an ambulance for his dying brother, according to authorities.

Neighbors in the quiet residential block were shocked after hearing about the gruesome murder.

One neighbor, who declined to give her name, told the Chicago Tribune the family were 'wonderful neighbors, probably the best neighbors I've had.'
