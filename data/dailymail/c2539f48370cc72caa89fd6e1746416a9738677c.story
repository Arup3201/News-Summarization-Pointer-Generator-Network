Luis Suarez is no stranger to controversy. And the Barcelona star is now inviting fans to ‘bring on the hate’ in a provocative advertising campaign.

Suarez has been relatively trouble-free since he left Liverpool last summer on the back of his World Cup biting storm which saw him suspended until last October.

However, his performances at the Nou Camp have yet to hit the heights he achieved at Anfield, with the Uruguayan striker scoring just five goals in 15 appearances since signing for the Catalan giants for £75million.

The new adidas video, seen exclusively by Sportsmail, sees Suarez, Bale, Benzema and Co star 

But in this new adidas video, seen exclusively by Sportsmail, the 27-year-old - infamous for other controversies such as biting Branislav Ivanovic in April 2013 and racially abusing Patrice Evra in October 2011 - shows he is ready to reignite on the pitch, even if it creates fresh dramas.

Suarez is portrayed as the ‘Target Man’ and is seen taking a barrage of punches before brushing them off and smiling, while dismissing negative headlines written about him.

‘If you have “haters”, then it’s the ultimate compliment,’ said adidas, who are launching their latest set of f50, predator, nitrocharge and 11pro boots.

‘The best players know that a great performance delivers “hate” from fans and opponents, particularly on social media, which then continues to fuel the confidence to deliver even greater performances.

‘They thrive off it – and they make no apology in doing so.’

The world’s most expensive star Gareth Bale also plays a leading role in the advert, alongside his Real Madrid team-mates James Rodriguez and Karim Benzema.

The captivating film, which kicks off with an inciting voiceover: ‘They hate the way you walk. They hate the way you talk…’ 

'Hero' Bale, ‘Golden Boy’ Rodriguez and ‘Hip Hop VIP’ Benzema take centre stage in a whirlwind tour of the perceived lives of these players, focusing on their flash lifestyles, over exuberant goal celebrations, possessions and good looks.

The stars go on to illustrate exactly how, why, and what their ‘haters’ dislike about them the most

Throughout the short clip, the stars go on to illustrate exactly how, why, and what the so-called ‘haters’ dislike about them the most.

‘They hate your shiny new boots. They hate your boots… because they wish they were in them.’

Suarez is expected to wear the boots for the first time this weekend when Barcelona travel to Elche, while Bale, Benzema and Rodriguez will sport them on Saturday against Cordoba. 

Bale already wore the boots on Sunday and scored in a 3-0 win over Getafe, proving they're already doing wonders for the ex-Tottenham star.

A host of Premier League stars will also show them off in this weekend’s FA Cup, while fans can purchase them from February 2.

adizero f50

The adidas adizero f50 is worn by the most prolific players in world football and has been designed to maximise speed and manoeuvrability. A revolutionary new design including a “ghost” graphic, sleek red colour and new 3-Stripes branding ensures you will own the bragging rights on the pitch. A 3D dribbletex layer on the upper allows for better speed dribbling in wet or dry conditions. The outsole has also had a complete re-design, with a new grip texture and stud configuration with a second level of traction on the forefoot base, inspired by sprint spikes.

Predator

Following last year’s 20th anniversary of the iconic boot, the Predator has also been given a re-design. A newly designed super-soft upper provides all the benefits of leather and synthetic. The 3D engineered SL rubber zones, combined with the newly engineered gel pod, provide optimal grip on the ball and an enhanced capability for precision passing. The revolutionary control frame provides ultimate contact with the ball, with the transparent outsole giving you the magic touch and complete control.

Nitrocharge

Nitrocharge has been re-energised with the latest technology. The energy-sling positioning has been used alongside an increased area of protection pads and protection mesh to provide unrivalled stability. Nitrocharge is the perfect boot for “The Engine”, box-to-box, all-action player.

11Pro

The 11Pro is the most comfortable to date and is the “perfect suit” in terms of elegance and style. The skeleton in the heel and forefoot offers a better fit and increased stability. The all-new comfort outsole also features a comfort frame which distributes pressure across the shoe, while new smaller studs provide perfect ground penetration. The leather upper provides an ultra-comfortable fit as well as optimum control.
