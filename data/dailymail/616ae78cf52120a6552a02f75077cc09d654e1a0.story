Daniel Sturridge is on course to make his first appearance for Liverpool since August later this month after completing his rehabilitation in the USA.

The 25-year-old has been out for more than four months with thigh and calf problems but Reds boss Brendan Rodgers has confirmed that the striker could return to action in January. 

Sturridge landed at Heathrow airport on Thursday afternoon after spending time across the pond working with medical staff from the Boston Red Sox and personal trainer Scott Schrimscher in a bid to get his season back on track.

And Rodgers, who was speaking in his pre-match press conference on Thursday, is hopeful his star forward will make a successful return.

He said: 'He [Sturridge] will be back in the country over the next 24 hours. The work he has done has been fantastic. 

'His rehabilitation has been great and we hope that he will be available at some point in January. 

'He is a top class player with wonderful idea of the game. His pace is frightening and he is at a great age. If he can sustain that and stay fit, we hope he will lead the charge for many years.'

Sturridge took to Instagram on Thursday to tell fans that he was leaving the USA and returning to Liverpool to continue his battle for fitness.

But Rodgers is in no rush to get the former Chelsea striker back in his starting XI after a number of injury setbacks this season.

He added: 'There is no date [for his return]. We just need to assess. A lot of great work has gone on and hopefully he won't be too far away.

'We have taken our time on this one. We are trying to look after the medium and long term.'

Liverpool have been linked with a move for Manchester City midfielder James Milner, whose contract at the Etihad runs out at the end of the season.

But while admitting he is a fan of the midfielder's talents, Rodgers refused to confirm whether or not he will try and bring the 29-year-old to Anfield.

'James is a wonderful player and has been ever since I saw him at Leeds,' Rodgers said. 

'Players get linked here all the time. I would never speak about player at another club.'
