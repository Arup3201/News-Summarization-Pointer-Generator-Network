Many British workers won’t consider moving jobs unless they can earn 20 per cent more, according to a new study.

Based on the average salary of £26,000, that would mean an extra £5,200.

A third of employees said this would be the minimum they needed. Only one in ten workers would be inspired to change jobs for a rise of less than five per cent, according to the survey by jobs website Monster.

The firm’s UK managing director, Andy Sumner, said: ‘The desire for more money is a result of the jobs market improving. Businesses should consider what their current staff are really worth. They need to do this to avoid losing them to bigger-budget competitors.’

It was also revealed this week that British workers are happier with their jobs than French or Italian workers, according to an international study from recruiters Randstad.

British people are the second-most satisfied group of the four major European economies, as the economic recovery drives more opportunities for new roles and career progress.

The surveys also revealed that job satisfaction in the UK has increased greatly since the start of 2010, when levels were just 62 per cent, trailing France, Italy and Germany.
