It was never supposed to be an island.

In fact, the medieval village of Mont Saint-Michel was founded on a coastal beauty spot surrounded by green and pleasant lands.

But today, for the first time since 1879, it became one as the tide rose to record levels, smothering the causeway that allows its 44 villagers and three million annual tourists to cross onto the French mainland.

After 20 minutes, however, the waters receded and Le Mont St Michel returned to its normal state of somewhere in between.

Popular: More than 3 million tourists visit the medieval islet throughout the year

Famous: Le Mont St Michel, one of France's most famous landmarks, is a rocky 
island topped by an 11th-century Benedictine Abbey looming dramatically on
the horizon

The last time the rocky outcrop was a true island was 134 years ago when the raised wooden causeway was built to replace a natural causeway that had been all but covered by rising seawater.

Le Mont St Michel, one of France's most famous landmarks, is a rocky 
island topped by an 11th-century Benedictine Abbey looming dramatically on
the horizon.

Recent years have seen the islet come under the strain of a series of court cases, strikes and political wranglings.

Cars and coaches were banned last year from driving over the causeway to park on the island after local villagers complained they were having to walk half a mile from the nearest space to leave their cars to catch a shuttle bus to get home.

Then mayor Eric Vannier was convicted for illegally trying to persuade officials to move the shuttle bus stop nearer to hotels and restaurants that he owned.

Abbey staff and shop keepers also went on strike, complaining they had to queue with tourists for the shuttle buses onto the mainland.

And plans for redevelopment were quashed last year after pressure form world heritage campaigners at UNESCO, including blueprints to build a helipad by the abbey and an island tunnel.
