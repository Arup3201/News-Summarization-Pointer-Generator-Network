Can it really be 10 years since Cesc Fabregas made his first Premier League start as an unknown 17-year-old for Arsenal against the likes of Nigel Martyn, Alan Stubbs and Kevin Campbell at Goodison Park?

That Fabregas will enjoy his second debut in top-flight English football a decade later in his prime at 27 only serves to highlight the remarkably young age he gate-crashed the Arsenal first team. The teenager played 46 games that season in all competitions.

On this occasion, and for campaigns to come, he will be wearing the blue of Chelsea – a sight to stick in the craw of those supporters who hailed him a hero from the first burst into the box.

Arsene Wenger passed up the option to buy his former captain with Mesut Ozil already in his ranks and Alexis Sanchez on his way.

Jose Mourinho, recognising the need to replace the impetus Frank Lampard provided from midfield, acted swiftly to bring the Spanish World Cup winner to Stamford Bridge for £30million. It could prove the signing of the summer.

Already in pre-season Fabregas has reminded of his talents. A stunning 30-yard free-kick against Vitesse Arnhem was followed by a solo goal in the last friendly against Ferencvaros in which he dribbled into the area, bamboozled defenders, and slotted into the corner.

They were the kind of clinical contributions that made Mourinho say: ‘Frank is the history of the club, history nobody can forget. Fabregas is the future; history is history but the future is more important at the moment.

‘My opinion, and the opinion of my players, is that Fabregas is the right player to occupy that central position in midfield.’

Diego Costa would surely endorse such an appraisal. The striker has linked up well with Fabregas, who should provide assists more frequently than the finishing touch himself.

A cutting edge in the final third became Fabregas’s hallmark during eight years at Arsenal, where he would drive on from midfield before picking a pass to unlock defences. He moved to Barcelona in 2011 with 98 assists and 57 goals in 303 appearances, leaving a chasm in Wenger’s side.

But his time at the Nou Camp was spent more in the shadows. It was always going to be that way with Lionel Messi the shining beacon. Fabregas did score 42 goals and created 48 assists in 151 matches for the Catalans but was far from a regular starter and often played out of position.

To rub salt in any wounds Barcelona released a statement after he was sold to Chelsea claiming the fee was good business because his performances often trailed off as the season progressed.

Combined with Wenger’s snub it means he returns to England with something of a point to prove. That might sound disingenuous considering this is a player with one World Cup and two European Championship medals to his name, but Barca only won one La Liga title during his stay. For Arsenal, there was an FA Cup victory in 2005 but nothing else.

His standing in the game would be instantly lifted were he to provide the thrust that sent Chelsea to the Premier League summit come May and Mourinho is the perfect manager to pinpoint such a mental trigger.

The Portuguese’s own ego will be bruised from two seasons without a domestic title and he will apply the right psychology to generate a fighting reaction from Fabregas. You can imagine him emerging at Stamford Bridge this season as a midfielder with an aggressive edge.

Robust: The 27-year-old could be the catalyst for Chelsea success this season by commanding their midfield

He will first take the field against Burnley at Turf Moor on Monday night and it is then we will see how Mourinho’s reshaped team, with Fabregas at its heart, is looking.

Chelsea have not won the Premier League since 2009-10 but are installed as favourites this time because of their signings and the fact Mourinho’s alchemy is so potent.

Fabregas will be the catalyst on the pitch and his immediate impact must give Wenger cause for concern. He never seemed keen to re-sign the gem he polished but given he has enhanced a rival for the title a doubt over his decision may linger.

The clamours to explain his call would grow were Fabregas to help bring the trophy he never won for Arsenal to his new club across London.
