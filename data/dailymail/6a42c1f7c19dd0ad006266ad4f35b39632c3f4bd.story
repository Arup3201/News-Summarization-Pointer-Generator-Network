Neil Lennon held further talks with Bolton on Saturday as they drew closer to appointing a new manager.

Lennon had been poised to speak to Al-Ittihad in Saudi Arabia but is understood to have met Bolton owner Eddie Davies in he hope of securing a deal with the Championship strugglers.

Currently propping up the English second tier after winning just one league game this season, Bolton have been looking for a new manager since parting company with Scot Dougie Freedman last month.

Lennon has been away from football’s front-line since leaving Celtic in May after a successful four-year spell.

He was due to travel to Saudi Arabia this week for talks on the vacant Al-Ittihad post but visa problems meant he and his backroom staff were unable to travel to Jeddah.

Whilst a remuneration package of over £2million per year was attractive, Lennon had reservations at moving to the Middle East in any event in terms of his career development.

The challenge of firstly securing the Trotters’ place in the Championship before building for promotion is far more appealing and there’s every chance he could take the team for the first time at Birmingham next week.
