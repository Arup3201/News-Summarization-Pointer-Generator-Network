Tom Varndell set his sights on a century of Aviva Premiership tries and the all-time scoring record after striking twice at Adams Park to condemn Newcastle to a 20th successive league defeat.

The 29-year-old wing took his personal try tally in the competition to 79 — seven behind Mark Cueto — as Wasps surged into fifth in the table with this bonus-point victory. Having touched down once in each half, Varndell revealed his ambition to finish his career ahead of his wing rival from Sale.

‘I’m chasing him, but I’ve still got a long way to go,’ he said. ‘Of course that’s a target of mine but I’m not going to set a time-frame for it. I just have to focus on playing well for my team, but there is always that carrot that I want to finish as top try-scorer.

Wasps: Miller; Tagicakibau, Daly, Leiua (Wade, 66), Varndell; Goode (Masi, 54), Simpson (Davies, 57); Mullan (Yapp, 60), Festuccia (Lindsay, 57), Cooper-Woolley (Cittadini, 56); Gaskell, Myall (Cannon, 66); Johnson, Jackson (Hughes, 64)

Sin bin: Wade, 73

Newcastle: Hammersley; Tait (Alesana Tuilagi, 53), Tiesi, Powell, Sinoti; Socino (Clegg, 56), Tipuna (Fury, 59); Brookes (Rogers, 34), Lawson (Hawkins, 59), S Wilson (Tomaszczyk, 59); Green, Barrow (Furno, 51); M Wilson (Mayhew, 51), Hogg 

‘That would be nice. I’m not sure how long I would keep it for, because there are a lot of young wingers coming through, but chasing Cueto is definitely one of my targets.’

Varndell admitted being left out of the Wasps side for the first game of the season — following the signing of Sailosi Tagicakibau from London Irish — had served as a ‘kick up the a**e’ which has led to a run of three tries in three matches. He has his eye on the three-figure landmark, adding: ‘100 tries in your career in the Premiership would be awesome.’

England aren’t exactly awash with prolific try-scoring candidates to play on the wing ahead of next year’s World Cup, but Varndell hasn’t played for his country since 2008. He retains faint hope, saying: ‘It’s in my head, but I can’t go out thinking about that. I’m 29, I’m not ancient. I’ve got to carry on playing the best I can and hopefully Stuart (Lancaster) will see what I can offer.’

This was not an emphatic triumph by Wasps, but it was a good return given that director of rugby, Dai Young, had rotated his squad, with England lock Joe Launchbury resting in the stand. Their victory was founded on a superb showing by South African flanker Ashley Johnson, who carried strongly, handled with sublime class and set up two tries, as well as tackling with gusto and competing fiercely at the breakdown.

‘I thought he was a deserving man of the match,’ said Young. ‘He has been outstanding for us all season — he’s a real talisman and he comes up with some big plays.’

However, Young’s opposite number, Dean Richards, was not convinced by one of those plays — the pass to send Varndell away for his second try. It looked marginally forward, but was not reviewed by the referee — another Dean Richards — and that incensed the man in charge of Newcastle, who suggested his struggling team had been harshly treated.

‘Tom Varndell scored a try off a pass by Ashley Johnson which was only two yards forward,’ he quipped. ‘I don’t know why the ref didn’t come back for that and it really affected the morale of our guys. You don’t get anything when you are down at the bottom and the refs don’t even listen. Our physios and water-boys told the ref that was a forward pass and he didn’t even listen.’

Remarkably, Richards claimed the Falcons’ sequence of league defeats, which is nearing a full calendar year in duration is ‘not much of a concern to the guys at all’. It should be, as the North East club are destined for another season of grim struggle against the spectre of relegation.

At least the visitors scored two tries — the first a twisting effort from scrum half Ruki Tipuna and the second a penalty try at the death when Christian Wade was sin-binned for what was deemed a deliberate knock-on near his own line. They could have had another, but Alex Rogers knocked on over the line in the second half.

Yet, the outcome was not really in doubt from the 20th minute, when Elliot Daly’s sharp offload teed up Varndell’s first try. Andy Goode’s kicking kept the hosts in front and James Gaskell galloped over before the break. Johnson set up Varndell for another left-corner strike and Rob Miller burst away for Wasps’ bonus-point try from Wade’s pass in the closing stages.

Young had mixed feelings, saying: ‘Parts of our game were very good and parts of our game were messy,’ but his side are heading in the right direction.
