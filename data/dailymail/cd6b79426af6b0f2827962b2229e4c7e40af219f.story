World Cycling will show FIFA the way when it comes to transparency around a major inquiry when their doping investigation reports in February.

FIFA continue to prevaricate on how much of Michael Garcia’s probe into World Cup bid corruption will ever be made public because of confidentiality issues despite a global demand that it is seen in full.

But Brian Cookson, British president of UCI — cycling’s ruling body — has promised their own investigation into cycling’s chronic drugs problem will be published in full.

The question of confidentiality will be solved by redacting any names or detail where there is an issue. 

FIFA, who have left it to compliance chief Domenico Scala to decide how much of Garcia’s findings to release, should follow Cookson’s lead.

Meanwhile, Cookson flew business class from Heathrow to Nice yesterday for the International Olympic Committee Congress in Monaco. In contrast, Peter Dawson, head of the International Golf Federation, was in economy. 

The only British presidents of Olympic summer sports had never met and were introduced on the IOC bus taking them from Nice to Monaco.

Crystal Palace, who cannot compete with the Premier League’s big spenders, are looking to India for football prospects. 

A delegation led by new Palace ambassador Mark Bright went to the Subcontinent yesterday to search for a young star and forge long-term links. Palace have set up a partnership with Peter Reid-managed Mumbai FC and will be holding trials for the most promising 16-19-year-olds.

They will also offer the winner of a Premier League talent festival an opportunity to train at the Palace academy.

Clare Balding’s announcement that her new C4 contract will see her present just Royal Ascot and Cheltenham Festival racing did not go down well at Aintree. 

Not only did it coincide with their free racing day to encourage newcomers to the sport, but Balding  has prioritised working on the Boat Race for BBC rather than Liverpool’s Grand National flagship when the two clash in 2015. 

Aintree are not happy that Clare Balding will not be presenting Channel 4's coverage of the Grand National

An Aintree spokesman described the timing as ‘unfortunate’. Balding wanted to tell her C4 colleagues first at Sandown. .

FIFA president Sepp Blatter should be suitably embarrassed at the IOC Congress when age-limit proposals are rubber-stamped that will mean him stepping down when he reaches 80 in May 2016. 

By then he could be just a year into an unbelievable fifth term as FIFA overlord with three more years to go. Blatter made his most impassioned IOC speech during the Sochi Winter Olympics when he argued that any age limit was ‘discriminatory’.

Sepp Blatter may be forced to step down from the IOC in 2016, although he is likely to still be running FIFA

McIlroy needs a push

Rory McIlroy‘s two majors and a Ryder Cup success makes him the strongest candidate to become Sports Personality of the Year. 

Nothing is certain, however, with golf always seeming reticent about promoting its cause — as seen when the St Helens’ rugby league side beat Europe’s victorious Ryder Cup squad to the 2006 team award. 

Despite his two major wins, Rory McIlroy might be hampered in the BBC poll by golf fans' refusal to vote

Now it is likely that Formula One’s bigger social media traffic will see world champion Lewis Hamilton over the line first.

Sport England chief Nick Bitel has defended his organisation’s use of the Active People Survey when it come to deciding funding. 

APS was due to be published last Thursday but flaws in an outside company’s data research means it has been delayed until the end of next month. This brought criticism from some sports that Sport England are far too influenced by APS findings when awarding funds.

One leading figure calling the statistics ‘deeply flawed civil servant nonsense’. But Bitel said: ‘APS is a fantastic tool that we have trusted to deliver long-term trends in participation. But it is not the only research we use and sports tend to like or dislike APS depending on how the results affect them.’

The British Olympic Association have stayed in-house when choosing their director of communications. The job has gone to the loyal Miriam Wilkens after she showed great passion and enthusiasm for the role — despite there being a long list of outside candidates.
