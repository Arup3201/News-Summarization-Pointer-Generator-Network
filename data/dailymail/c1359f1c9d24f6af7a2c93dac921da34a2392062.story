Obesity costs the state £5bn a year (stock photo)

Thousands of people who say they are too fat to work are costing taxpayers nearly £30m a year, new figures show.

Statistics issued by the Department for Work and Pensions show that a total of 7,080 people claimed £29.3m sickness benefits for obesity in the year to April 2012.

Critics said it was time 'people took responsibility for their actions', as it emerged that the number of people claiming they were too obese to work had doubled in three years.

Obesity costs the taxpayer more than £5bn a year, with many obese people relying on benefits entirely, as well as needing expensive healthcare, equipment and carers.

The Government is keen to cut the enormous welfare bill, which comprises payments made under the Disability Living Allowance, Severe Disability Living Allowance, and Employment and Support Allowance.

April will see the introduction of the the Personal Independence Payment for those 'of working age', ie aged between 16-64.  It will replace the Disability Living Allowance and will be paid out only after a face-to-face consultation with a trained assessor.

Six out of ten people will have their benefits reduced or even stopped as ministers try to drive down the benefits bill.

The new DWP statistics, which were released in response to a Freedom of Information request, showed that last year's incapacity benefit bill topped £22bn - an increase of £1.4bn from the previous year.

The constituency with the highest number of people claiming incapacity benefits is Knowsley on Merseyside, where 21,6000 receive payments.  Next up was Glasgow East with 19,830 and then Walton, Liverpool, with 19,360.

Birmingham also had high numbers of claimants, along with Manchester, Leeds, Sheffield, Bradford, Rhondda Valley and Sunderland.

Matthew Sinclair, Chief Executive of the TaxPayers' Alliance, said: 'Obesity is costing taxpayers dear. Tackling the problem early is vital as it's not fair on the claimant or other taxpayers that someone is allowed to become dependent on benefits because of their weight.

'Ultimately people have to take responsibility for their actions and show they are taking steps to get back to work. For too long the benefits system has been quick to write people off and put them on the sick. This has to stop.'

In October 2011 the Government launched a Call to Action campaign to tackle obesity and reduce the nation's calorie intake by 2020.

Ministers called on food producers to cut the calories in food and drink, and to help people make healthier choices.

Too fat to work: Paul Mason had to quit his job as a postman when he could no longer deliver letters

Paul Mason, 51, from Ipswich, had to give up his job as a postman when he became too fat to complete his delivery rounds.

He says a compulsive eating disorder made him eat ten times more food than he needed until he was unable to walk or even stand, and had to be cared for full-time at home.

At the height of his weight problems he ate about 20,000 calories a day, weighed 70 stone, and needed a specially-built bungalow provided for him by the council.

When Mr Mason became ill, firefighters had to knock down a wall in his house and use a forklift truck to get him to hospital.

Three years ago, he had a gastric bypass on the NHS and slimmed to 25 stone, but now he wants another operation to trim his excess skin.

He said: 'It needs doing now, and probably in another four or five years - it doesn't matter how much toning up you do, it's only going to get worse.'

Mr Mason, who once held the title of world's fattest man, is said to have cost taxpayers more than £1m in benefits.  When his weight was at its peak, he needed two full-time carers and specialist medical equipment and housing estimated to cost £100,000 a year.
