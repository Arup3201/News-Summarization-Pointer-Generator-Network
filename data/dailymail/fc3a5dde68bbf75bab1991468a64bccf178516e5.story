The supermarket chain Aldi has taken one of Roald Dahl's classics off Australian shelves after complaints over the word 'slut' was found in a children's book.

Revolting Rhymes, published in 1982, was sold in stores on Wednesday but Aldi confirmed on Thursday that the book has been removed from sale.

The collection of poems in Dahl's picture book reinterprets six well-known fairy tales but features twisted plots instead of the traditional happily-ever-after.

Dahl's take on the Cinderella fairy tale sees Prince Charming decapitate Cinderella's two ugly step sisters' heads and she ends up marrying a jam-maker after she wished to marry a decent man.

'Poor Cindy’s heart was torn to shreds. My Prince! she thought. He chops off heads! How could I marry anyone who does that sort of thing for fun? The Prince cried, ‘Who’s this dirty slut? Off with her nut! Off with her nut!’,' the poem reads.

Sydney Morning Herald reports the ban followed after a customer posted on the supermarket’s Facebook on Wednesday that the book had 'an unacceptable word in it for kids' but the comment has since been removed from the page.

Aldi replied on Thursday morning on Facebook that: 'This particular book has been removed from sale. If you wish to return the book, you can do so at your local ALDI store.'

An Aldi spokeswoman confirmed the book had been removed off shelves after 'comments by a limited number of concerned customers regarding the language used in this particular book.' But other books by the children’s author will continue to be stocked in stores, she said.

'Aldi Australia would like to inform all of our customers that we take the concerns from the community seriously,' she said.

Angry customers have taken to the supermarket's Facebook page to express their anger after one of Roald Dahl's classic was pulled off the shelves

Andy Griffiths, the author of Australian children’s classic The Day My Bum Went Psycho told Guardian Australia that 'this is the kind of material that kids love because kids want to go to those darker places and to the icky places, and explore them.'

'One of the best ways to do that is with humour, so that you touch the fearsome, the fearful, the disgusting that we all know is there, and the kids need to have it acknowledged,' he said.

'But with humour you take away the fear from that, it neutralises it and makes it something you can celebrate in a healthy way.

'Parents need to be reassured that it’s OK to read about people being beheaded, particularly if they’re evil, and this is a healthy phase of children’s development. I would say to them, it’s OK if you don’t want your child reading that [Roald Dahl] book, of course you have ultimate say.

Following the action, appalled customers took to Aldi's Facebook page to express their disappointment over the decision.

Sharon McGuinness said: 'Dear Aldi, you practised censorship yesterday, bowing to the opinions of a small number of people who unfortunately did not appreciate Roald Dahl's humour in his classic 'Revolting Rhymes'. You have also contravened the worldwide policy of 'Freedom To Read'. Now, that's truly revolting! Reinstate the book in all your stores, please!'

Anne Ransley said: 'I am a long-term customer of yours. I am thoroughly disgusted that you have seem fit to remove a Roald Dahl book from your stores on the basis of a few complaints from narrow-minded people. The book in fact promotes the merits of good behaviour in children.'

Steve Butler said: 'I've never done this before, but i'm using facebook to express my anger at your decision to remove Roald Dahl books from stores - absolute disgrace, you've reacted to the vocal, extreme 0.05%. Absolute shocker of a PR decission whoever was responsible for it, re-stock the books - appologise, learn and move on.'
