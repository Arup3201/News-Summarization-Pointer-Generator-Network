Families have been warned to not to approach an escaped giant owl - that’s so big it can eat cats and dogs.

Zeus, the Eurasian Eagle-Owl, flew away from an aviary on Monday and has so far eluded capture.

The 15-month-old bird is fully grown, boasting a 5ft wingspan and powerful enough to scoop up foxes and even small deer.

Falconer Lee Hayman, of Exeter, Devon, and his wife Claire have had Zeus for a year and say he’s a gentle giant with people he knows.

But they warned families to keep clear of the massive bird in case it gets spooked and attacks them.

Claire, 24, said: 'Zeus is about 15 months old and as such is fully grown. He is extremely powerful so obviously people must not approach him.

'He may be spooked and will fly to another destination, or he may attack. It is very important that they do not try to feed the bird, just ignore it and act as if it’s not there.

'It is ringed and has anklets on and we do not think it will have flown too far away, perhaps within a couple of miles’ radius of us. It is likely to be in someone’s garden.'

Eagle owls grow to three times the size of barn owls.

They are capable of killing foxes, marmots and small deer but they mainly hunt rats, rodents and hedgehogs - skinning them before eating them.

Lee, 29, has already investigated several sightings but each time Zeus had flown off before he could get there.

Lee said: 'He’s without doubt one of the most powerful birds in the world. But he’s not a killing machine, he’s a gentle giant.

'I can cuddle him and kiss him on the head but I wouldn’t recommend anyone else trying that. He would only attack if he was cornered and he felt threatened.'
