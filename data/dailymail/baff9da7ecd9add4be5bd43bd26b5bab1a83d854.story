Blown away: A widow popped intruder Michael Lewis as he allegedly assaulted her in her bathroom

It's unclear what Michael Lewis, 21, was planning when he broke into a home in the west Phoenix suburb of Maryvale on the morning of May 6.

He likely wasn't expecting to get caught in the crosshairs of a widow with a deadly weapon.

The Arizona homeowner, 47, had called 911 after she noticed a stranger trying to force his way into her home.

'They've tried my front door and my pet 
door, and now they're trying to break in my back gate,' she tells the 
911 operator in audio released by 12 News.

'I have a gun in my hands,' she continues. I'm terrified.'

The
 operator tells her that officers are on the way as she hides in her 
bathroom.

After going through the gate, Lewis climbed onto the woman's back porch and broke through the sliding glass door with a gardening tool.

Once Lewis is inside, a struggle ensues between the two, and the widow drops the phone.

Suddenly, a gunshot is heard.

'Did you think you could beat me half to death?' she shouts.

'My face is bleeding from some place,' 
she tells the operator after a moment, as Lewis is heard screaming in the 
background. 'He was beating on me.'

Fire away: By the time Phoenix police reached the home Lewis had broken into, the widow had already shot him in the bathroom

She questions Lewis as he lays on her bathroom floor, telling the operator Lewis 'said he thought the house was abandoned' with disbelief.

The widow later told reporters that she learned how to shoot a .38-caliber pistol from her recently deceased husband.

Lewis was taken to the hospital, where he was treated for a month before being released to police. He pleaded guilty to second-degree burglary and aggravated assault, and was released on $1,500 bond.
