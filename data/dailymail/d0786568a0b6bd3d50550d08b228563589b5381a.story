Gentleman, start your engines: Danica Patrick is reportedly separating from husband

Motor sports star Danica Patrick has given the checkered flag to her husband of seven years.

The 'Go Daddy' frontwoman reportedly filed for divorce January 3 from Paul Hospenthal - 17 years her senior - in Superior Court of Arizona, saying, 'My marriage is irretrievably broken and there is no reasonable prospect of reconciliation.'

Patrick, 30, wed Hospenthal, a one-time physical therapist, in 2005 after a whirlwind romance that began with him improbably treating her for a yoga injury.

The Sporting News was the first media agency to obtain - and report on - the court documents concerning Patrick's divorce.

A Patrick spokesman reportedly said that the NASCAR phenom would have no comment on the break-up.

'I’ve always been very private about my private life and I’m going to keep it that way,' Patrick told HuffPostLIve last November.

The news wasn't exactly unexpected, as Patrick first announced her plans to divorce Hospenthal on her Facebook page in November.

'I am sad to inform my fans that after 7 years, Paul and I have decided to amicably end our marriage,' she wrote.

Checkered flag: Patrick first publicly stated that the divorce was imminent in a Facebook message she posted in November

'This isn't easy for either of us, but 
mutually it has come to this. He has been an important person and friend
in my life and that's how we will remain moving forward.'

No further explanation for the rift was rendered in the divorce paperwork, as Arizona is a so-called 'no-fault' state, which means that divorcing parties are not required to give a reason for parting ways.

The Sporting News reports that Patrick stated in her filing the couple have a prenuptial agreement, and that neither party will require alimony.

Numerous media outlets have pegged Patrick's fortune to be in the neighborhood of $18million, while Forbes, for its part, has estimated she has made $36million since 2006 in purse money and endorsement earnings.

The soon-to-be former couple have no children, and their relationship has not been marred by domestic violence, according to the divorce filing.

Patrick, whose third-place finish in the 2009 Indianapolis 500 was the highest finish for a female in that event, will be a Sprint Cup rookie this season for Stewart-Haas Racing.

She ran three seasons in the NASCAR Nationwide Series. She finished 10th in the Nationwide standings last year, becoming the first female driver to finish in the top 10 in a NASCAR national touring series last year.

The divorce cannot be finalized for at least 60 days from the time Hospenthal is served with the divorce papers, The Sporting News reports.

Meanwhile, Hospenthal will have an opportunity to respond to the filing.
