A passenger dialled 999 and reported his drink-driver friend to police after she confessed to getting behind the wheel after downing three pints, a court heard.

Sian Adam, 27, was driving a male friend home from the Man of Kent pub in Rochester, Kent, when she admitted to him that she had been drinking alcohol.

The front seat passenger, who was not named in court, demanded she pulled over before calling 999 to report her for drink driving on December 12 last year.

When police arrived on the scene they arrested the young woman as she walked away from her car.

Her  passenger, who had reported her to police, was still sitting in the car and told police it was him who called them.

A breath test found that Adam was almost twice the legal limit and gave a reading of  67 micrograms of alcohol in 100 milliliters of breath. The legal limit is 35 micrograms.

Medway Magistrates Court heard how the pair had 'got into an argument' after she admitted drinking three pints of lager.

The court was told that 'at some point' the handbrake was pulled and the car parked at the side of the road. 

Adam's of Upchurch, Swale, Kent, admitted drink driving, telling the court: 'I know what I have done is wrong and stupid - it was out of character and I put everyone's life in danger.', the Medway Messenger reported.

Magistrates disqualified her from driving for 18 months, fined her £250 and ordered she pay £85 costs.
