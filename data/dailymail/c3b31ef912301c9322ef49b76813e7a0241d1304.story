Airbus has begun talks with a European regulator to make ejectable flight recorders available on its two largest models. 

The announcement means the company's  A380 and new A350 aircraft could be the first commercial planes to use such technology.

The European company also hinted that in the future, it could expand the use of these ejectable recorders, which combine voice and data recordings, even further - to new versions of its A330 and A320 jets.

The talks with the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) comes in the wake of the December 28th AirAsia tragedy, where the data recorded was recovered but the voice recorder is still missing.

An ejectable recorder would make it easier to recover evidence in such cases.

Already used in military planes, ejectable or 'deployable' recorders separate from the tail during a crash and float, emitting a satellite distress signal.

'Airbus is working with EASA and other stakeholders to advance the approval of such a solution industrywide,' a spokesman for Airbus said, adding that there was no indication when the devices might come into use.

'In the future, applicability for our other aircraft products could likewise be considered, but presently, we have decided to focus on the A350 and the A380.' 

EASA declined to comment.

After being recommended by investigators following the Air France A330 jet crashed in 2009, ejectable recorders have recently been gaining support at the United Nations' International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO).

A proposal recommending that new commercial aircraft certified after 2016 be equipped with them is to be heard by ICAO's Air Navigation Commission this month.

If approved, following a three-month consultation among 191 member states, it would likely appear in a new package of ICAO standards in 2016, possibly coming into effect from around 2021.

That said, ICAO's standards are not always implemented by all member nations.

Such an initiative could also benefit existing military suppliers including Finmeccanica's DRS Technologies, which is pushing for ejectable black boxes in commercial aircraft.

However, not all countries appear ready to back the technology, which is seen as only one way of recovering evidence on crashes over water. 

Others include rolling out lower-frequency locator beacons, under an already approved ICAO standard, that would make black boxes easier to find.

Some officials fear that relying solely on ejectable flight recorders would take attention and resources away from the search for deep-water wreckage and bodies that can also help solve air crashes and ease the suffering of families.

Boeing has taken the opposite stance over the use of deployable recorders, arguing that the majority of its black boxes are recovered within 30 days, also citing instances where these alternative recorders have failed on military aircraft.
