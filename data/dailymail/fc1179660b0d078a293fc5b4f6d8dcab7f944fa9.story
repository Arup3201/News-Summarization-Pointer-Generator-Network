Discounted boob jobs will be offered on the Gold Coast to compete against the increase in patients heading to Asia for cut-price surgery.

In an Australian first, a cosmetic tourism agency based in Queensland's Broadbeach is teaming up with respected plastic surgeons to offer cheaper procedures.

CosMediTour, along with Dr Craig Layt and Dr Luke Stradwick, are offering boob job holidays for about $7900.

Gold Coast girls Natalie Kernke, Anna Thomsen and Noi Aasen have all travelled to Thailand to get their boob jobs through CosMediTour

The agency the girls travelled through is now offering discounted boob jobs on the Gold Coast

For those who just want the procedure done, it's $6880 - including an anaesthetist and the hospital stay.

Through the new Gold Coast Breast Academy, the two doctors will train plastic surgeons for standard breast implants that can be offered at a cheaper price.

Breast implants with a plastic surgeon cost $10,000 on average in Australia compared to $4000 in Thailand.

A Surfers Paradise or Broadbeach boob job holiday includes a nine-night stay, day surgery at Southport’s Pacific Private Hospital and a follow-up appointment six days after the surgery.

About 100 patients a month travel through CosMediTour a year to get cosmetic surgery in Thailand

There is also an option to upgrade to have a nurse monitor patients on the first night.

And there is already interest coming from New Zealand and Perth, just days after the package went on offer.

‘There are people who don’t want to go to Thailand or are not comfortable to have surgery off-shore,' CosMediTour managing director Greg Lemon said.

'We don’t send anyone to plastic surgeons in Thailand...and we wanted to offer people the option of using plastic surgeons here.

'You can get cut price boob jobs in Australia, but not with plastic surgeons.'

About 80 per cent of the people sent over every month by the agency are getting boob jobs

In Australia, a plastic surgeon has to be accepted into the Royal Australasian College of Surgeons and study an extra five years to become qualified, where as a cosmetic doctor does not.

CosMediTour currently sends about 100 patients every month jet to Bangkok or Phuket, with 80 per cent of them having breast implants.

But there is a catch to getting discount breasts.

The cheaper price is for implants up to 400ml and patients have to meet certain criteria.

Mr Lemon said the procedure would be ideal for women with no sagging breasts or asymmetry because they would need different surgery.

Gold Coast resident Anna Thomsen, who had a boob job in Bangkok, welcomed the discounted procedure to Australian shores.

'I think it’s a great idea having it on the Gold Coast because some people would be terrified of the idea of going to Thailand so it makes it a bit more convenient,' she said.

CosMediTour is offering boob job holidays for $7900 in Surfers Paradise or Broadbeach. A boob job alone is $4000 in Thailand

According to Phuket International Hospital’s Peter Davison, there is a market for cheaper breast implants in Australia.

He said out of 2000 cosmetic surgery cases a year 1600 were Australians, with 30 per cent from Queensland and that trend is growing.

Mr Davison said the hospital was seeing a 30 per cent growth in numbers every year.

Respected surgeons Dr Craig Layt and Dr Luke Stradwick will train other doctors at the new Gold Coast Breast Academy to offer the cheaper procedures, using implants similar to those pictured above
