Lord Lucan's widow was pictured in Belgravia, central London, where she lives yards from the murder scene from nearly 40 years ago

Hiding behind large sunglasses and swathed in a full-length black coat, the Countess of Lucan went practically unnoticed as she walked through the streets of central London.

Pictured days before a new ITV drama is to air about the Lord Lucan mystery, his wife Veronica, 75, was spotted in Belgravia, where she lives in a small mews house close to the murder scene.

Nearly 40 years after since the murder of the family's nanny in what was believed to have been a botched attempt to kill Lady Lucan, a new documentary will claim the 7th Earl of Lucan was murdered by the criminals he had hired to help him escape the murder.

Lady Lucan, who bore the peer three children, refused to cooperate with the producers of the drama, entitled Lucan, as did her lawyer daughter, Camilla Bloch.

She is thought to have been the target for the murderer who killed her children's nanny, Sandra Rivett, at their home in Lower Belgrave Street.

Lady Lucan was herself badly injured in the attack and when she was able to make a statement afterwards, she named her husband as the man who attacked her and killed their nanny.

Last month she said: ‘I don’t think it is right that a criminal matter should be used for entertainment.

'The film is based on the most absurd book I have ever read on the Lucan affair so I didn’t think it was sensible to have anything to do with it.’

Her daughter, Lady Camilla Bloch QC, who was four when her nanny was murdered and her mother attacked, said: 'As a lawyer I hope it’s not old-fashioned to point out that my father never stood trial. It is unfortunate that he is regularly referred to – in almost factual terms – as a murderer.

‘He has never been able to defend himself and the evidence was not conclusive. It was circumstantial.’

Lord Lucan's son, the 8th Earl of 
Lucan, George Bingham, 45, is said to be happy with the fictional drama 
which, its creators say, seeks to provide a new insight into the events 
of November 1974.

The 
drama, starring Skyfall actor Rory Kinnear as Lord Lucan, is based on 
John Pearson’s 2005 book The Gamblers, all about the high-society 
figures who were members of John Aspinall’s Clermont Club in Mayfair.

Pearson believes Lucan had underworld contacts whom he had enlisted to dispose of Lady Lucan’s body after he had killed her.

However, when his plans went awry the gangsters then decided Lord Lucan himself had to be got rid of as well, before he was caught, because they feared he would reveal their role in his plans to police.

The show's makers say they have gone to great lengths to piece toegther what they believe are the precise details of the crime.

The two-part documentary, which also stars Christopher Eccleston as John Aspinall and Catherine McCormack as Veronica Lucan, begins tomorrow night at 9pm. 

Born Veronica Duncan, she married John Bingham in March 1963 and the newlyweds moved into a large house in Lower Belgrave Street in London's Belgravia, not far from the Clermont Club where he liked to play cards.

Soon after, Bingham's father died and the gambling-mad old Etonian inherited the title, becoming the seventh Earl of Lucan.

In 1964 their first child, daughter Frances, was born, followed by their only son, George, in 1967, and another daughter, Camilla, in 1970.

After each birth Lady Lucan suffered badly from postnatal depression, and she was treated with antidepressants.

While her husband was initially sympathetic, the couple began rowing.  As his gambling debts began to mount up, and rumours spread about domestic violence, the marriage fell apart and in 1973 Lord Lucan moved out of the family home and into a flat in nearby Elizabeth Street.

Lady Lucan stayed at the big house and looked after the three small children with the help of nanny Sandra Rivett.

Lord Lucan wanted custody of the children and hired a private investigator to spy on her but she won full custody in 1973.  He reportedly told more than one person that he wanted to kill his wife so he could move back into the family home and be with his children.

On 7 November 1974 Lady Lucan was at home with the children and, unusually for a Thursday, her nanny.  Rivett was in the basement kitchen making supper for Lady Lucan and her elder daughter and when she was slow in coming upstairs, Lady Lucan went to investigate and found the kitchen in darkness.

She said she called out the nanny's name and was then hit over the head with a blunt instrument.  She later said her attacker was her husband, and he told her he had killed Rivett.

Lady Lucan fled to a nearby pub for help, leaving her sleeping children in the house, while Lord Lucan tried to call a friend and then his mother to say Lady Lucan had been injured and the children needed rescuing from the house.

Lord Lucan is believed to have escaped London in a car which was later found in Newhaven on the south coast, sparking suggestions he fled abroad.  No body has ever been found.

Lady Lucan, who never remarried, suffered enduring problems with her mental health and is now estranged from her children.  She spends her time at her house in Belgravia updating a website she runs giving her version of events.
