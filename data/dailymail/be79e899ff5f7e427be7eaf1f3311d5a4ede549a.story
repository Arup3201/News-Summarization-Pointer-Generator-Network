Named by rivals: Vincent Omari, 22, was said to be a member of Lizard Squad, which has claimed responsibility for hacking into the PlayStation and Xbox networks. He denied the accusation

Three rival hacking groups have called a ceasefire after admitting their Christmas attack on Xbox and Playstation gamers 'took it too far'. 

The attack - said to be carried out by a group called Lizard Squad, among others - left 160 million users unable to use their consoles, including children who had just received them as Christmas presents.

Microsoft's Xbox live which has more than 40 million subscribers was disabled for around 24hrs. 

Meanwhile, some of Sony's 110 million users were still reporting problems on Sunday afternoon.

Sky News reports that Lizard Squad, rival hackers from the Anonymous group, Finest Squad group, and controversial internet entrepreneur Kim Dotcom debated the attack in a video uploaded to YouTube.

A hacker from the Anonymous group said: 'We care about the status of Xbox and Playstation, and we want to make sure that gamers stay connected for as long as possible.

Kim Dotcom said the attack had overshadowed good work of hackers.

'I think that this attack on Christmas and on kids around the world, the hacker image has suffered,' he said.

'I think we should talk about the impact that this attack had on kids worldwide and I want to make sure that we leave this call with some conclusions and agreements that this type of thing won't happen again.

'Hacking is one thing but taking down an entire gaming network when people have just got their Christmas gifts is taking it a notch too far.'

At the end of the video, the groups declare a 'ceasefire'. 

It has emerged that the FBI is investigating an alleged member of the Lizard Squad hacking group.

The teenager is said to be named Julius Kivimaki and who goes by 'ryanc' online. Kivimaki is said to be 16 or 17 years old and lives in Finland, DailyDot.com reports.  

The comments come after British man who was named as one of the hackers who carried out the Christmas Day cyber attack on game consoles is believed to have posted online about his fears of 'ending up in jail'.

Vincent Omari was last night said by a rival group to be a member of Lizard Squad, which has claimed responsibility for hacking into the PlayStation and Xbox networks.

About 160 million users were left unable to use their consoles, including children who had just received them as Christmas presents.

Last night Mr Omari, 22, denied the accusation. Speaking outside his parents' home in Twickenham, South-West London, he said: 'I am not a member of Lizard Squad. I am not one of the hackers. It is a case of mistaken identity.'

However, in messages believed to have been posted by Omari, a Twitter user with the tag @VinnSec admitted he was the 'spokesperson for the group', adding that police knew about cyber attack 'and they have all my info if needed'.

Another tweet from the account read: 'Let's see what happens next, I wonder if I'll end up in jail for representing lizardsquad.' 

Earlier, Mr Omari spoke to Sky News and presented himself as 'an independent security analyst', without any suggestion of him being a member of the hacking group.

However, on BBC Radio 5 Live, an unnamed man with an identical voice who said he had just turned 22 admitted being part of the attack. Mr Omari turned 22 on Christmas Eve. 

A second Lizard Squad member has been identified online as a 16-year-old grammar schoolboy in Kent.

Meanwhile, a Finnish man in the hacking group claimed the attack was simply designed to expose the poor security of PlayStation and Xbox. 

Calling himself Ryan, he said just three people masterminded the attack and felt no guilt at forcing 'a couple of kids to spend their time with their families instead of playing games.' Ryan told Sky News: 'We have a massive capability to take down networks like this.

Fears: In messages believed to have been posted by Omari, a Twitter user with the tag @VinnSec said: 'Let's see what happens next, I wonder if I'll end up in jail for representing lizardsquad.'

Claiming responsibility: In a brazen television interview, the man (pictured), who went by the name 'Ryan', said he and a small group launched the Christmas Day cyber attack on computer games consoles

'One of the big aspects was raising awareness regarding the low state of computer security at these companies. These companies make tens of millions every month from subscriber fees – they should have more funding to be able to protect against these attacks.'

The Xbox status page said yesterday that Microsoft services had been restored, while Sony's PlayStation said it was getting to grips with the issue.

The hacking meant that downloaded games could not be played and gamers could not compete against others around the world.

Ryan said: 'It is sort of a game for us, I have to admit. I completely understand that it's a bit unethical.'

Meanwhile, another hacking gang has published details of more than 13,000 users of websites including those run by PlayStation, Xbox and Amazon.

The group posted username and password details as well as credit-card numbers and expiry dates. They left a message on Twitter saying they had done it 'for the Lulz', meaning 'for laughs'.
