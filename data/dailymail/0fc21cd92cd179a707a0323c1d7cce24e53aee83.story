Billions of pounds of British aid money is paid with almost no checks on how it is spent, MPs warned last night.

Ministers have been urged to do ‘much more’ to safeguard the £4.9billion a year given to agencies  after hearing that officials make only two visits to inspect countries where the UK does not have its own aid programme.

Britain gives 60 per cent of its aid – one of the highest levels – through agencies such as  the World Bank, European Union and United Nations who decide how  to use the money.

The US prefers to have direct control – through bilateral arrangements – of how its money is spent and only gives 26 per cent of its aid to multilateral groups.

In a highly critical report by the Commons international development committee, MPs said they were shocked that British officials made only two visits to see for themselves how the money was spent.

Committee chairman Sir Malcolm Bruce said: ‘We accept that country visits are not the only way of gathering evidence.

‘For a number of multilateral organisations, the UK has a seat on the board, which obviously provides us with some oversight.

‘Nevertheless, we feel strongly that... the team should undertake more visits to countries in which the UK has no bilateral programmes.’

The Department for International Development (Dfid) has boasted of slashing the administration costs on its own projects to around three per cent.

But MPs said this misleading because so much aid cash is now spent with organisations whose costs are often at least twice as high.

The report warned cost cutting at home was creating ‘a perverse incentive for Dfid to allocate more of its money to multilaterals, many of whose administration costs are far higher for the wrong reasons.’

It went on: ‘Dfid’s allocation of funding should not be guided by the desire to “export” its own administration costs.’ 

MPs also voiced surprise that Dfid had continued to fund a series of organisations despite warning two years ago that they offered poor value for money.

A major review by Dfid in 2011 found that nine of the organisations it funded, including five run by the United Nations were performing poorly. But despite this Dfid has continued to fund four of them.

A further nine organisations given the second lowest rating of ‘adequate’ have had their funding increased by £97million, equal to a 12 per cent rise.

Dfid last night defended its approach to funding multilateral organisations, but said the process was kept under constant review.

A statement said: ‘The Multilateral Aid Review process, introduced by this Government, provides a rigorous assessment of the value for money of multilateral agencies and is a model that has been adopted internationally.

 ‘We remain determined to get better value for money and more effective aid from multilateral agencies.’
