The Dude and Ferris Bueller now have something in common: both are have been declared national treasureS.

The Big Lebowski, Ferris Bueller's Day Off and Saving Private Ryan are among 25 movies being inducted this year into the National Film Registry for long-term preservation, the Library of Congress announced Wednesday.

The library selected films for their cultural, historic or aesthetic qualities. This year's selections span the years 1913 to 2004.

Unforgettable: Ferris Bueller's Day Off starring Matthew Broderick is among 25 movies being inducted this year into the National Film Registry

Masterpiece:: The 1986 movie was chosen as the first film on the registry from the late director John Hughes

Gritty epic:Stephen Spielberg's World War II saga Saving Private Ryan from 1998 was chosen in part for its ultra-realism with scenes depicting 'war as hell'

The films named to the registry include Hollywood classics, documentaries, silent movies, student films, independent and experimental projects. 

This year’s selections bring the number of films in the registry to 650, which is a small fraction of the Library’s vast moving-image collection of 1.3 million items.

Among the latest batch of inductees are such familiar and popular titles such as the horror classic Rosemary's Baby and the original Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, as well as lesser known movies that were milestones in film history.

Stephen Spielberg's World War II masterpiece Saving Private Ryan from 1998 was chosen in part for its ultra-realism with scenes depicting 'war as hell.'  

Cult classic: The Coen Brothers' 1998 slacker comedy The Big Lebowski is a tale of kidnapping, mistaken identity and bowling

Horror masterpiece: Roman Polanski's 1968 Rosemary's Baby starred Mia Farrow in her first role as a pregnant woman who believes she has become the target of a sinister plot  

On a lighter note, the comedy Ferris Bueller's Day Off from 1986 starring a young Matthew Broderick in the title role was chosen as the first film on the registry from the late director John Hughes.

Curators noted Ferris Bueller emerged as one of the great teen heroes of film.

The oldest selection dates to 1913 and is believed to be the earliest surviving feature film starring black actors. Vaudevillian Bert Williams gathered with black performers in New York City to make the film Bert Williams Lime Kiln Club Field Day. 

The film was discovered 100 years later in the film vault at the Museum of Modern Art.

Pure imagination: Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory starring Gene Wilder was a 1971 musical adaption of Roald Dahl's surreal book

Here are the 25 films selected in 2014 by the Library of Congress to be preserved as part of the National Film Registry:

The Library of Congress runs a major film preservation effort at its audio-visual conservation center built inside a Cold War-era bunker in Culpeper, Virginia.

'By preserving these films, we protect a crucial element of American creativity, culture and history,' Librarian of Congress James Billington said in announcing the new selections.

Some of the most endangered films are silent films. 

A report from the library last year found 70 per cent of the nation's silent feature films have been lost and only 14 per cent still exist in their original 35 mm format.

The silent films selected for preservation this year include The Dragon Painter from 1919, starring Hollywood's first Asian star, Sessue Hayakawa, and the 1916 silent film Shoes, which examined poverty and prostitution, curators said.

Other films were chosen for their cultural significance. 

A 1976 independent film entitled Please Don't Bury Me Alive! that was chosen for the registry is considered by historians to be the first Chicano feature film. 

Set in a San Antonio barrio, filmmaker Efrain Gutierrez explored his story as a young Chicano man, questioning his people's place in society at the end of the Vietnam War as thousands of his Latino brethren returned home in coffins. 

Others faced segregation, poor schools and a justice system that was filling prisons with Chicanos. The filmmakers were angry with how Hollywood portrayed Mexican Americans.

'We were invisible in our own national culture,' Gutierrez said in a written statement. 'We were being buried alive.'

The most recent film on the list in James Benning's 13 Lakes from 2004 - a feature-length film that can be seen as a series of moving landscape paintings reminiscent of Claude Monet.
