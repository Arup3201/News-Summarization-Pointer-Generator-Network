A revamped 1960s tower block, a home in the ruins of a 12th century castle and a chapel for nuns are in the running for a top architecture prize.

They feature on the shortlist of six for the Royal Institute of British Architects' Stirling Prize which celebrates the year's most exceptional buildings.

And for the first time in the 18 year history of the UK's best-known architecture prize, half of the practices have women at the helm, it was revealed.

Colourful: Park Hill Phase 1 by Hawkins/Brown with Studio Egret West in Sheffield, which has been shortlisted for the 2013 Riba Stirling Prize for best new building

Interior: Park Hill is a once-despised tower block complex in Sheffield which has had a contemporary refit. It had long been an eyesore until it was given an overhaul

Unique: The Giant's Causeway Visitor's Centre by heneghan peng architects in Northern Ireland has also been shortlisted for the Stirling Prize for best new building

Modern: The Giant's Causeway Visitor's Centre in Northern Ireland features on the shortlist of six for the Royal Institute of British Architects' 2013 Stirling Prize

Contemporary: A housing project on the shortlist is Newhall Be in Harlow, Essex, a group of 84 new homes which 'raises the bar for suburban housing developments'

Interior: The winner of the contenders - including Newhall Be in Harlow - will be announced on September 26 at Central Saint Martins, King's Cross

Also competing for the 2013 award are a new visitor centre at the Giant's Causeway, an estate of new homes in Essex and a new medical school building. Bookmaker William Hill has installed Bishop Edward King Chapel in Cuddesdon, Oxfordshire, as the favourite to win the prize.

The £2million building, finished earlier this year, was built for Ripon College and an order of nuns, the Community of St John the Baptist, and it features a series of high windows which flood it with natural light. Judges said that it ‘fulfils its complex brief with a lyrical grace’.

Also on the list is the once-despised Park Hill tower block complex in Sheffield which has been given a contemporary refit. The half-century old ‘brutalist’ concrete estate was given Grade II listing in 1997 but for many in the city it had long been an unloved eyesore until it was given an overhaul.

This included preserving a notable piece of graffiti in neon lights, reading ‘I love you will u marry me’.

A more contemporary housing project on the shortlist is Newhall Be in Harlow, Essex, a £12million group of 84 new homes which judges believe ‘raises the bar for suburban housing developments’.

Others in the running are the University of Limerick Medical School, the Giant's Causeway Visitor Centre in Northern Ireland and Astley Castle in Warwickshire - a Landmark Trust holiday home which has been created in the ruined walls of a 12th century manor.

The shortlist includes five architecture firms which have never previously figured in the list.

Angela Brady, Riba's president, said: ‘The Riba Stirling Prize is awarded to the building that has made the biggest contribution to the evolution of architecture, and nowhere is the need for fresh-thinking needed more than in housing.

‘The UK is blighted with unimaginative, poor quality houses that people don't want to live in but have little other choice, so I am delighted to see two amazing and highly original housing projects on this year's shortlist.

‘These projects show how when talented architects and clients work together and focus on quality, affordable and desirable new homes can be created. They shine a light on what the future of UK housing can be.

‘All six shortlisted projects are ground-breaking in their own way - buildings that deliver more than could ever have been expected.

'Some of them, such as Park Hill and the Giant's Causeway Visitor Centre, are genuinely courageous in laying out a new visionary approach.

This RIBA Stirling Prize shortlist is sending out the clear message that creative vision improves our lives.’

The winner will be announced on September 26 at Central Saint Martins in King's Cross, central London.
