Misting machines were introduced on the fresh produce counters at Morrisons to create an impression of freshness.

Everything from lettuces to loose tomatoes were constantly sprayed with fine droplets of water, giving the idea they had just arrived, fresh out of the ground.

The resulting fog was part of the ‘retail theatre’ introduced by chief executive, Dalton Philips, who arrived from running a retail chain in Canada to spread a little magic over Morrisons and its sales.

The machines are to go, despite having been installed in some 300 Morrisons supermarkets

However, it seems they were a little too fancy for customers of Morrisons, which has decided to pull down the curtain on this particular show.

Mr Philips was ousted last month following a vicious campaign from an old guard of company executives, including Sir Ken Morrison, the former chairman and son of the founder of the chain.

Traditionally, Morrisons, which was founded in Bradford in 1899, built the layout of its stores around the theme of a street market with green grocer, butcher and baker.

The set-up appealed to customers in the north, where the brand is strong, who had a reputation for being careful with their money.

Consequently, the decision to bring in the misting machines, which has since been copied by some other stores, was something of a surprise.

Now, after spending a large sum of money installing the machines in some 300 of the chain’s supermarkets, the new management at Morrisons have decided to get rid of them.

It is not a moment too soon for Sir Ken, who has long argued the machines highlighted how Mr Philips had alienated core shoppers, many of whom have switched to budget rivals Aldi and Lidl.

One of Mr Philips’s biggest critics, Roger Owen, a former long-serving main board director, has been lobbying the company’s chairman, Andy Higginson, to get rid of the machines.

‘You don’t need misting. It is a waste of money, a waste of time and it does carry a risk unless you spend a significant amount on maintenance,’ he said.

‘I said one of the first things Andy Higginson should do is take it out, which he obviously has done and good on him.

‘If this is an indicator of his intention that he has already spoken about of getting the business back to its core values and core strengths, then this is a step in the right direction and a very, very visible one.’

Morrisons’ group retail director Martyn Fletcher told staff about the decision to dump the misting machines earlier this week.

A spokesman said: ‘This move is about going back to basics, using simpler refrigeration techniques and Morrisons’ traditional strengths in fresh food management to ensure our vegetables stay fresh.’

Morrisons did not actually fare too badly in recent sales figures compared to rivals

The U-turn represents an end to what has been dubbed the ‘war of fog’ between Mr Philips and his detractors.

The former chief executive has always proudly defended the misting machines, which were used particularly in the South East, where stores attract a more middle class shopper.

He gave an interview to Retail Week last month saying: ‘I will refute until my last day about taking the stores upmarket, we did not do that. 

'There are parts of the south of England which I think have benefitted from the slightly different assortment and I don’t regret that.

‘Misty veg is in our competitors now. The most important thing is whether our customers liked it or not.’

The misting machines were part of a radical make-over for the Morrisons chain carried out by Mr Philips, who became chief executive in 2010. 

He also introduced an online shopping service and began opening small convenience stores to tap into changing shopping habits.

This week, industry sales figures were released suggesting his radical ideas were beginning to bear fruit, however the improvement came too late to save Mr Philips and his job.

Figures from Kantar Worldpanel show sales were down by 0.4per cent over the past 12 weeks compared to the same period last year. 

This was the best performance by the chain for a year and much better than Asda and Sainsbury’s.
