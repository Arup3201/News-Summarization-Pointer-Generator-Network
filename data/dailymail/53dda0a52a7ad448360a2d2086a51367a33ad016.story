A jewellery-shop owner says he feel lucky to be alive after having to fight off three machete-wielding raiders who ransacked his store, costing his business thousands of pounds.

Neil Kay was serving a customer in his security-locked shop in Wigan, Greater Manchester, when the masked trio smashed down the front door to carry out the high-value raid.

A CCTV camera captured the drama as the jeweller, who has run Neil Kay Jewellery in Tyldesley Arcade for 27 years, fought to defend himself and his beloved shop from the thugs.

This dramatic CCTV footage shows the moment that a jeweller fought off 
three machete-wielding thugs outside his shop in Wigan, Greater Manchester, to defend the store from a high-value raid

suffered machete cuts as he fought off the three masked men

Mr Kay managed to temporarily chase one of the men away from the shop but sustained horrific machete cuts as he was faced with a
 machete, knife and sledgehammer.

Despite his brave efforts, the raiders still managed to ransack the store, stealing dozens of Rolex watches and costing Mr Kay's business thousands of pounds.

The thugs even pinned down Mr Kay's assistant Michelle Rhoden as they carried out their crime spree.

The three men then scrambled back into their stolen grey Vauxhall Astra, which was later found abandoned nearby.

By that time, they had switched to an Audi to continue their getaway.

Mr Kay, who has run the shop since 1987, said: 'I feel so lucky to just be alive after the robbery as who knows what could have happened with such weapons. 

Mr Kay said he felt 'lucky to be alive' after facing attacks from the 
machete, knife and sledgehammer. He said: 'I try not to think about the 
alternate consequences'

The men, who were dressed head-to-toe in black, were caught on CCTV 
walking towards the store, holding weapons in their hands, before 
smashing down the door of the shop, as Mr Kay was serving a customer

'I put my arms up above my head to defend myself and so luckily the machete just cut my hand, it would have been much worse. I try not to think about the alternative consequences.

'It was such a horrifying ordeal which I hope I never have to go through again.'

The 54-second clip begins by showing the three men, who are dressed head-to-toe in black, getting out of a car in a car park.

After ransacking the store, the three men raced back to their stolen grey Vauxhall Astra, which was later found abandoned

The scene then cuts to the gang walking down a street lined with shops, while shoppers look on.

The next scene shows the three men inside the shopping centre, walking towards the store and holding weapons in their hands.

They burst into the store before Mr Kay - who was dressed in a white shirt and dark trousers - bursts out of the shop and scuffles with them.

The jeweller chases off one of the men, while two others can be seen going into the shop.

The last scene shows the three men running out of the shop. The first carries a black bag in his hand.

A second man leaves after him, waiting for the third, who also carries a bag, before the three flee the shopping centre.

Police have appealed for information about the raid. Anyone with information should call 0161 856 7124 or Crimestoppers on 0800 555111.
