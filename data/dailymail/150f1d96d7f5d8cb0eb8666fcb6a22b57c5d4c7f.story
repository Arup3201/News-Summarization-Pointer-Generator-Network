This is the moment paramedics fought to save a mother-of-two allegedly shot dead by her estranged husband  in the street yesterday.

The 46-year-old victim, named locally as Caroline Parry, drove to a quiet suburban cul-de-sac in Newport, South Wales, to meet her former partner to exchange belongings at 8.30am yesterday.

But Chris Parry, 49, is alleged to have pulled out a shotgun, shooting her twice in the chest and then turned the weapon on himself but 'blew half his face off' in a failed suicide bid.

Death: The shotgun used in the attack lying on the floor next to a paramedic's bag

Pictures taken in the moments after the killing show his shotgun lying on the grass next to two cars with their boots open.

Surgeons were yesterday fighting to save Mr Parry's life and he remains critically ill in hospital.

Neighbours have said police had been called 'several times' to the couple's house during blazing rows between the pair in the months leading up to the  shooting.

And officers took out two guns from their neat modern mid-terrace house in the city in the hours after the shooting.

One neighbour said: 'It is ridiculous that he was left with guns in the house after the police knew there was trouble between them. Why didn't they take his guns before it was too late?'

Crime scene: Chris Parry allegedly lured his wife to this Newport street with the promise getting possessions back after their break-up

Caroline had told husband of 27 years Chris she was leaving him for another man.

She had moved out of the family home in Cwmbran, South Wales, shared with daughter Naomi, 19, and son Aaron, 16.

But Caroline agreed to meet Chris on Thursday morning to hand over some of her belongings at Seabreeze Avenue in Newport.

When Chris pulled up in his car at the meeting point he pulled out a single barrel shotgun from his boot - and blew his estranged wife away before trying to kill himself.

Police yesterday revealed they knew about the domestic history of the couple and have referred the case to the Independent Police Complaints Comission.

After the shooting police swooped on the couple's home 10 miles away in Cwmbran, South Wales, where they had lived for 20 years.

They were seen taking away two more shotguns from the family home.

House: This is the Parry's family home in Cwmbran, South Wales where police were called after Caroline Parry and Chris Parry were seen having blazing rows in the street just weeks before he shot her

A close neighbour, who didn't want to be named, said: 'We often heard them shouting and arguing recently and police had been to the house a few times.

'They took away two shotguns after the shooting and it makes you wonder why they allowed him to keep the guns.

'Chris seemed a nice guy and used to talk a lot about fishing.'

His partner added: 'The couple had a furious row in the street about a month ago and Caroline left soon afterwards.'We have been here about a year and they seemed such a nice couple.

'Caroline was very attractive and smart and we are all shocked.

'Chris was a very friendly chap. He came round to our house to see if he could help when there was a problem with the electricity supply in the area.

'I am devastated this has happened - I just can't believe it.'

Last night the couple's teenage children were being looked after by their grandparents.

Caroline was one of six siblings including Ronald, Tony, Brian, Vincent and Paul.

Brother Brian Dare, 55, said Caroline and Chris had been married for 27 years before the split.

He was working at the family's scrap yard business when his sister was blasted to death just two miles away.

Brian said the whole family was still in shock at what happened to mother-of-two Caroline.

Police visited the scrap yard where he works with his brother Paul to break the news of their sister's death.

He said: 'The police came about 12pm. I couldn't believe it.

'It's one of those things - you don't expect it to happen to your family.'

A Gwent Police spokesman said: 'The 49 year old male remains in hospital in a critical but stable condition.

It is not believed anyone else was involved. Specialist officers are supporting family members at this time.'
