Workers at Vauxhall's Ellesmere Port factory in Merseyside are facing an uncertain future after reports from Germany indicate that the manufacturing plant has been earmarked for closure.

The news, which could mean the loss of up to 2,100 UK jobs, is understood to come from an internal General Motors ‘strategy document’ obtained by the German magazine Der Spiegel.

In an attempt to turnaround the financial fortunes of Opel - the German sister branch of Vauxhall - bosses are believed to be considering closing the plant and moving production to ‘low-cost’ countries.

According to Der Spiegel, the document states that GM may expand production capacity in countries where costs are cheaper while closing both the Ellesmere Port site and the Bochum plant in Germany.

GM Europe lost 527 million euros ($700 million) last year and company officials have expressed their determination to turn around the Opel and Vauxhall brands.

If vehicle sales rise, according to Sunday's article, GM will look to build up to 80 per cent of additional cars in countries such as Poland, Russia, China, India, Mexico and Brazil, ’

The magazine said the document entitled  ‘Global Assembly Footprint.’ was presented at a GM business conference where it was announced that the company plans to export an additional 300,000 vehicles to the European market from plants in Mexico, Korea and China by 2016.

A spokesman for GM in Europe said: 'No decision has been made in this regard for Opel's car production.’

A spokesman for GM's Opel unit said GM would always seize the opportunities the global automotive market offered, but declined to comment further comment.

Opel chief executive Karl-Friedrich Stracke was quoted by German paper Bild saying he ruled out plant closures and job cuts in the ‘near term’, but added there were ‘no taboos’ in its efforts to become more profitable in the future.

The statements came after the German WAZ group of newspapers cited Government sources as saying that Stracke had informed the German government about plans to close the Opel plant in Bochum, adding that a meeting between Stracke and the workers union was scheduled for today.

Referencing Stracke's comments a spokesman for Germany's Economy Ministry said factories were safe at least until the end of 2014 when production of existing models ends. He said: 'We are following the situation closely and we are in contact with the management of Opel.’

GM is the world's largest car-maker with 2011 sales of just over 9 million vehicles, up 7.6 percent from 2010. It last held the top spot in 2007 before it was surpassed by Toyota.

While GM's fortunes in North America have improved substantially since its 2009 bankruptcy, it is still struggling to become profitable in Europe.

Analysts say the restructuring plan must include job cuts and plant closures to address excess industry capacity across Europe, where sales are also falling.
