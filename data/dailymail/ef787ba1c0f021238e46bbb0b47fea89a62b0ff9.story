After years of torment, the family of the fisherman who claims to have spent 14 months adrift in the Pacific has spoken of their delight at his 'incredible' survival.

José Salvador Alvarenga left his parents and daughter in Garita Palmera, El Salvador, years ago to earn a living in Mexico.

When he disappeared in 2012, his relatives mourned.

Now, in an emotional interview to confirm his identity, his mother has spoken about her trauma for the first time, revealing she prayed for her son every day and saw him alive in her dreams.

María Julia Alvarenga, 59, today told El Salvador's El Mundo newspaper: 'I dreamed about him, I saw him alive in my dreams.

'But then he vanished. I kept dreaming like that for several days.

'I feel happy that my son is alive and that soon we'll have him back home.

She added: 'We thought that he must be dead.

'I cannot find the words to describe how I feel, as his mother, to know that he has been found.'

Fatima, Mr Alvarenga's 14-year-old 
daughter, was six when her father emigrated to Mexico, leaving her with her grandparents in the province of Ahuachapán.

She
 said she is now excited to meet him once more: 'First thing I'll do is hug him and kiss him.'

The
 so-called 'Miracle Man of the Pacific' is currently recuperating in a 
hotel in Majuro, where his incredible survival was announced last week. 

Rescue: Mr Alvarenga steps off the boat into Majuro after 14 months at sea - before a much-needed haircut

The fisherman had his beard shaved, which was bleached orange by the sun, as he prepares to be see his family again. He wept on the phone to his brothers and sister in Maryland, parents and daughter in El Salvador

His sun-bleached hair has been trimmed and wounds have been treated as he prepares to be reunited with his family on Friday.

Asked what he would say to his family, Alvarenga told Telemundo: 'That I miss them very much and I will be with them soon.'

I cannot find the words to describe how I feel, as his mother, to know that he has been found

But he was treated to something of a reunion last night with a phone call to his siblings who live in Maryland.

The brothers and sisters gathered to watch footage of Mr Alvarenga arriving in Majuro - and screamed, 'That's him!'

Brother-in-law Jorge Bonilla said: 'It's incredible! I'm so happy'

Mr
 Alvarenga wept as he spoke on the phone to his mother, brothers and 
sister for the first time in years from his hospital in the Marshall 
Islands.

He told his sister, Evelin: 'I want to go home, I want to talk to Mommy.'

Difference: Young José Salvador Alvarenga looks nothing like the sun-bleached and bloated man today

His father, José Ricardo Orellana, 65, said: 'I feel mixed emotions to see José Salvador like this, a mix of sadness and happiness.

'I had heard that he has gone to sea and was lost at sea, but I always prayed for his well being.'

Alvarenga's incredible story is not being doubted by U.S. officials in the Marshall Islands - even as some cast doubt on his claims - and as new details emerged of his life at sea, his account has gained credibility.

Now, experts have come out in support of his claims.

Jaime Marroquín, the Mexican rescue service official who oversaw the search, told the Guardian a boat and two fisherman were reported missing from Costa Azul on 19 November 2012.

It was reported missing by the boat's owner, who Mr Alvarenga mentioned in his statement.

Fisherman in Costa Azul also confirmed they knew Mr Alvarenga, saying they knew him as 'La Chancha' - or 'The Pig'. They said he had lived and worked in the area for years.

'It’s a great surprise,' fisherman Belarmino Rodriguez Solis told El Salvador newspaper today.

'Nobody survives more than two or three months in those conditions.

'We even laid flowers in the palm hut where he lived,' Solis added. 'When fishermen leave and do not return we look for them.'

Another fisherman, Williams Decuir Uscanga, said: 'We’re surprised, we couldn't believe it, now that we saw him on the news we’re totally sure it is him.'
