The battle of the mortgage lenders intensified yesterday as a ten-year fixed-rate deal plunged below 3 per cent for the first time.

Barclays slashed its decade-long offer to 2.99 per cent as banks and building societies continued to cut rates across the board.

Ten-year fixed-rate mortgages have surged in popularity as the interest rates payable on them tumble to ‘remarkable’ new lows, experts said.

Homebuyers looking for long-term security are locking into fixed deals after competition between banks and building societies made the traditionally expensive option suddenly more affordable.

Lenders are now able to offer rock-bottom rates after economists widely predicted the Bank of England would not raise its base rate from its historic low of 0.5 per cent until as late as next year.

Ten-year deals give homebuyers the peace of mind of knowing that, should interest rates rise sharply, they will be locked into repayments that they are able to afford.

Some may have been burned by escalating rates in the 1980s and 1990s when they reached highs of up to 16 per cent, experts said.

The number of decade-long fixed rates on the market has ballooned from eight to 77 in the past year, according to the financial services comparison website Moneyfacts.

Interest rates on these deals have also been cut dramatically from an average of 4.64 per cent in November 2013 to 4.17 per cent this month.

Barclays yesterday announced the UK’s lowest ever ten-year fixed-rate mortgage at 2.99 per cent, including a £999 fee, for buyers with at least a 40 per cent deposit. This was previously available at 3.45 per cent.

Eleanor Todorova, of mortgage brokers John Charcol, said: ‘Ten-year fixed rates have become dramatically more competitive.

‘A year ago there were only a few deals on the market, but the number of lenders entering the ten-year market has been quite amazing, as well as the value for money they represent.

‘I think current expectations that the base rate will probably not rise for a year have contributed to the remarkable rates on offer.’

Sylvia Waycot, of Moneyfacts, said that while most homebuyers sought the flexibility of a two-year or five-year deal, ten-year deals were now ‘cheaper than ever before’. 

She said: ‘Fixing your mortgage for a decade at this exceptionally low rate has got to be of interest to a lot of people.’

The Barclays deal applies only to those with a large deposit, so is more likely to be taken up by second and third-time buyers.

However, Miss Waycot warned that homebuyers should look for a portable deal without high exit fees that allows them to transfer their mortgage if they move, and check if there are high charges should they need to borrow more money or want to repay their mortgage sooner.
