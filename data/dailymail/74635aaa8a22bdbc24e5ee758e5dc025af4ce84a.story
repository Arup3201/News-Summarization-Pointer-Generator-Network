A man who had just been told his wife was leaving him killed her and their daughter as she celebrated her 10th birthday in a restaurant and was shot dead by police as he fled.

Kevin Allen, 51, shot wife Katherine, 42, and daughter Kerri, dead and critically injured their other daughter Kayla, 10, in the shooting inside the crowded Cracker Barrel restaurant in Ohio.

Witnesses said Allen came into the restaurant in suburban Brooklyn on Thursday night with a shotgun and 'selectively' fired on his family.

The shooting created panic and 
confusion in the restaurant, and a manager helped get people out through
a rear door, a witness said.

Police
records dating back nearly 20 years painted a picture of Allen, married
at least three times, as a violent man with a history of threatening 
wives and others.

Just
two days earlier, Mrs Allen had told police in their hometown of 
Strongsville that she had left her husband and taken their daughters 
after 'an incident' on Easter and was afraid to go home to collect their
belongings.

Mrs Allen 
'stated that she has not been getting along with her husband and decided
to take the kids and stay with a friend,' according to the Tuesday 
police report.

Aftermath: Police investigate Thursday night's shooting at the Cracker Barrel restaurant, pictured, in Brooklyn, Ohio, which left three members of the Allen family dead

Fatal: Police were forced to shoot Allen as he attempted to flee the restaurant after killing his wife and daughter

'Initially
she wanted to pick up some items from the house, but decided not to 
because it would make him mad if police responded,' the report said, 
adding that Mrs Allen wanted to document 'verbal altercations' the 
couple had been having.

Mrs Allen called 911 from inside the restaurant on the fateful night, saying her husband was upset because she had told him she was leaving him.

He left the restaurant and was circling the parking lot, she told police. She also told police she feared he might become violent.

'I'm having some spouse problems,' Mrs Allen tells the dispatcher in the 911 call.

The dispatcher then asks her if Allen owns any weapons or is armed. She says her husband had told her he'd gotten rid of a shotgun, but she had seen him with shotgun shells.

She also told the dispatcher that Allen was calling one of her daughters in the restaurant.

At the end of the call, Mrs Allen says, 'He's here and the police are here, too. I have to ...' She then stops speaking.

The dispatcher says: 'Wait in the lobby for the officers. Do not go outside. Let them talk to him, OK? Ma'am?" The call then ends in a jumble of noise.

Officers heard gunshots when they arrived and saw Allen leaving the restaurant with a gun. Police Chief Scott Mielke said officers shot him when he refused to surrender. He died at the scene.

Mrs Allen died from shotgun wounds to her head and body, and Kerri died of a shotgun wound to the abdomen, according to the Cuyahoga County Medical Examiner.

Someone inside the restaurant, Robert Lovelace, told WKYC-TV that the shooting scene was chaotic.

'We all ran,' Lovelace said. He said people in the restaurant didn't know what was happening. "We just told them, `Look, let's get out of here,'" he said.

Killer: Allen, pictured, is said to have a history of violence against partners

The manager helped move people to safety through a rear door, the company said.

The restaurant will remain closed 
until the investigation is completed, Cracker Barrel spokeswoman Julie 
K. Davis said in an email from corporate offices in Lebanon, Tenn.

"This
appears to be the result of a domestic dispute between two guests and 
no Cracker Barrel employees were involved," she said.

Jody McIntosh, a waitress at the 
restaurant, told ABC 5 that she had left after finishing her shift when a
co-worker called to say that someone 'had shot up the place'.

In
February, Columbia Gas Co. requested a police escort to Allen's house, 
explaining he had not paid his bill 'and has stated he will shoot anyone
who attempts to turn his gas off,' according to a Feb. 22 Strongsville 
police report.

The report said the company eventually worked things out with Allen.

In
June 1995, police in Kirtland - about 20 miles east of Cleveland - 
arrested Allen after responding to reports of a violent argument between
him and his girlfriend, Janice Koerlin.

The argument was the same day that Allen received a divorce from his wife, the report said.

Koerlin told police at a previous house that Allen "had violent episodes and had smashed household items."

Three months later, Allen was arrested again after Koerlin - now his wife - said he tried to suffocate her with a pillow. The Sept. 14, 1995, report said Kevin Allen was a "manic depressive under medication."

Police reports say Allen also was arrested for burglary and theft in 2008.

Documents filed by Kevin and Katherina Allen in federal bankruptcy court in Cleveland last year indicate they owed $60,000 to various creditors, including a $20,000 hospital bill.

Other creditors included several credit card companies and two other hospitals. The filing was closed March 28.

Records also show that Allen filed for bankruptcy in 1991 and 2004, and that Mrs Allen filed for bankruptcy in 2000.

Other court records show Allen has an adult daughter from the previous marriage that ended in 1995.
