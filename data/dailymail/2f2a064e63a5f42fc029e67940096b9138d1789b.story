A family are furious after staff refused to allow their soya and dairy intolerant toddler to eat his special packed lunch in the restaurant.

Alex and Coral Pouros had spent £30 on the day out to Wingham Wildlife Park with 20 month-old Elliot.

They had prepared a special meal for the youngster who is restricted on what he can eat because of an intolerance to dairy and soya, and planned to buy food for themselves from the zoo restaurant.

But they were furious when park owner Tony Binskin insisted they could not eat in the restaurant and offered them a nearby empty room instead.

The family refused and left the zoo near Canterbury, Kent after just two hours and vowed never to return.

Osteopath Alex, 32, said: 'We explained the situation and as it was very cold outside I thought he would be understanding.

'I even said that if they had any dairy or soya-free food, we would buy that for Elliott.

'They didn't, but he still insisted he could not eat his lunch in the restaurant.

'To be honest, we were pretty upset because it seemed totally unreasonable. It's not as if the place was packed because there were plenty of places to sit.

'I wasn't prepared for Elliott to have to eat his lunch outside in the cold and told the owner that we had two choices - either we were allowed to sit indoors or we would have to leave.

'But he wouldn't budge so we left after spending £30 to get in and having a visit that lasted just a couple of hours.'

Alex, of Broadstairs, Kent, added: 'It was actually Coral's 32nd birthday and we thought it would be a nice day out, but sadly it wasn't.

'We had been to the park before with a young niece and enjoyed the experience but this time we just felt angry and hurt and certainly won't be going back.'

Markus Wilder, curator of the animal collection, disputed the family's claim there was no options for their son at the cafe.

'We have a menu of 55 items and there are only ten of them that contain soya or dairy,' he said. 

'Any of our cooked meals he would have been fine to eat; we have jacket potatoes, burgers...'

Mr Wilder said the family had been asked to leave the restaurant due to the park's strict policy but claimed they had been offered their own private room instead.

'We're only a fairly small park, and we have fairly limited seating so we have a policy that you cannot eat outside food from outside in the restaurant. It applies across the board.

 'The trouble is if we let one person have a packed lunch, then others see it and start to ask why they have been refused.

'It just gets very awkward for us because many people and children have special dietary requirements these days.

'In this case, I spoke to the family and did offer them an empty room nearby where they could still eat indoors, but the mother, in particular, still wasn't happy.

'We also have covered areas outside for people who bring their own food.

'We are looking at expanding the food range to accommodate more needs but our animals must come first and we can't direct funding away from them.'
