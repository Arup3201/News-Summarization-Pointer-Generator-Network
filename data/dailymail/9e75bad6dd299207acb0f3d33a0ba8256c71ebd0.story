A pimp is suing Nike for $100 million -- and says that its Air Jordan shoes failed to include a warning on them that they could be used as dangerous weapons after he used his own pair to beat a man.

Sirgiorgiro Clardy, 26, alleges Nike is partially responsible for Clardy's 100-year prison sentence for beating a man in 2012, The Oregonian reports. Clardy, a Portland-based pimp, was wearing a pair of Jordans when he stomped on the face of a man who was attempting to leave a hotel without paying Clardy's prostitute, the paper adds.

Clardy was found guilty of second-degree assault by a jury in early 2013. The victim received stitches and plastic surgery, according to The Oregonian.

Clardy was also found guilty of robbing the man and beating woman forced to be his prostitute, then 18 years old, so badly her ears bled.

Clardy, who is representing himself, handwrote his three-page complaint from the Eastern Oregon Correctional Institution in Pendleton, where he is incarcerated.

'Under product liability there is a certain standard of care that is required to be up-held by potential dangerous product,' he said.

'Do [sic] to the fact that these defendants named in this Tort claim failed to warn of risk or to provide an adequate warning or instruction it has caused personal injury in the likes of mental suffering.'

Clardy's complaint asks that that Nike be required to include warning labels for all 'potentially dangerous Nike and Jordan merchandise'

On top of seeking payment, Clardy's complaint asks that Nike be required to include warning labels for all 'potentially dangerous Nike and Jordan merchandise.'

Clardy's 2013 conviction was his 20th, Raw Story reports. He was also arrested in June 2012, as part of a sex trafficking sting operation, KATU reports, where three teenagers were rescued.

During his 2013 trial, a psychologist described Clardy as 'an anti-social psychopath who was 100 percent likely to commit crimes again,' according to The Oregonian.

'I’ve evaluated serial murders, serial rapists, and I’m going to tell you very few of those people reach the [scores] we’re going to talk about here,' the psychologist, Frank Colistro, reportedly said. 'People like Mr. Clardy are born bad. It’s not something we can fix. That’s why we have prisons.'

Clardy's suit will be served to Nike's Beaverton headquarters early next week for a response.
