Five years ago, 32-year-old Claire Lomas was paralysed when her spine was dislocated in a horse riding accident.

She was told she would never walk again but 
this year, after months of gruelling physiotherapy, she completed the London marathon in 16 days wearing a bionic suit
and raising £200,000 for charity in the process.

Not one to stop at just one challenge, Claire then set about taking on a 400 mile hand cycle ride across the UK.

Biggest challenge yet: Claire Lomas hand-cycled 400 miles over three weeks from Nottingham to London to raise money for Spinal research and the Nicholls Foundation

Starting in Nottingham, her journey took her 22 days and she crossed the finishing line in London on Monday.

Speaking on ITV's Lorraine show about her remarkable achievement, she said: 'It's a real relief to finish it but I am really happy with how it's all gone.

'I've raised around £80,000 so far by using Vodafone's Just Giving text service so I'm really pleased and that's what spurred me on through the tough times.'

Speaking about her toughest challenge yet, the inspirational athlete said: 'It was tough, I got a cold as well just to add to it so there were days when I just didn't feel like going out there and it was actually tougher than doing the marathon.'

Claire used the challenge to increase 
awareness of spinal injuries by cycling to schools, universities and 
workplaces in over a dozen different counties to give educational and 
motivational talks.

'I was fitting in school talks along the way and that was just brilliant. Seeing some of those children's faces is what kept me going as well.

'When I was in hospital there were lots of people worse off than me. I have had amazing support since my accident but not everyone has got that so we need to find a cure for paralysis.'

She has drawn in a wealth of celebrity support for her endeavours.

Speaking about her achievement, Gary Lineker said: 'Quite emotional I think really, when you consider what an achievement it is, you know 22 days hand cycling, truly inspiring, she is a remarkable lady.'

Former Spice Girl Mel C added: 'I will support that women in anything she does, she has got my full support.'

Claire is looking forward to getting back to normal life at home now with her two-year-old daughter Maisie and husband Dan, but is keen to spread her message to the masses.

She said: ''I had to rebuild my life and that's the story I have been giving to the children.

'Sometimes, things go wrong in life and at the time it felt like the end of the world to me and I really felt like every door was slammed in my face and it was difficult and it was tough.

'But I give my message out to the kids that you've got to fight back and you get out there and make your own luck.

'If I'd sat there and dwelled on everything I'd lost, I wouldn't have had the best days of my life after my accident so you've just got to keep going when things are tough.'
