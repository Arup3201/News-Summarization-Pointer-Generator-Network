The recent heatwave is thought to have brought killer blue sharks closer to the coast of Cornwall than ever before.

Diver Nick Robertson-Brown was photographing sea life with his wife Caroline when they spotted several of the sharks.

The specie is normally confined to the mid-Atlantic but last month it was spotted as close as 10 miles off the coast of Penzance.

Just last week Mr Robertson-Brown was diving only five miles from the coast when he came across a hungry pack.

He says he has also spotted them as close as three miles from shore before.

He said: ‘The warmer weather has brought these sharks closer and closer to the coastline.

'They have been spotted only three miles from the coast - which is a lot further in than where they are usually found.

‘The blue sharks are a very inquisitive shark. They came right up to us, which can be quite scary if you have never encountered a shark before.

‘To have one press its nose right up against your diving mask is quite a nerve-wracking experience.

Blue sharks are considered to be dangerous and have been known to be responsible for attacks on ship and air disaster victims.

In the past five years four people have been killed by a blue shark.

The largest ever recorded was 12ft 6in, but females average 9ft and males 8ft.

The specie has a bright blue body with a white underside and a pointed snout with long pectoral fins (on the side of the body).

They are also recognisable with their triangular, serrated teeth and large eyes.

Blue sharks normally inhabit deep water in tropical, subtropical, and temperate seas worldwide.

They are voracious predators, feeding on schools of fish including anchovies, sardines, herring and squid.

They can also travel hundreds of miles each year gathering in large groups or packs. 

Females give birth to 25-50 pups, (although once, a litter of 135 individuals was recorded) after a gestation period lasting 9-12 months.

They are classified as Lower Risk by the 2000 The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.

‘We were only five miles away from the coast.

'The warmer weather may well have brought the mackerel closer in, which is what they feed off.

‘We weren’t expecting to see them as close to the coast as this, so it was a real shock.’

The creatures - one of the ocean’s quickest predators  - mostly eat squid and mackerel but have killed four people worldwide in the past five years.

They can grow up to 12ft long and are known as the ‘wolves of the sea’ because they gather in packs. They are related to several other species, including tiger and bull sharks.

Mr Robertson-Brown, 60, said: ‘We were surprised to see them so close in to the coastline, but the warmer weather is causing a lot of change in the seas.

‘The following day a diving colleague of ours saw some of the sharks in at three miles, and they were in a very large group of nine.

‘We made sure we wore black diving gloves, as these sharks can often mistake white gloves for fish, which is when you could end up losing a hand.

‘Swimmers aren’t in danger from these sharks. They are highly unlikely to bite humans.

‘These sharks were over two metres long, but one of them swam off when it got a jellyfish sting on the nose.

'The warmer weather has brought more jellyfish closer in too, and there were lots in the water. I think the shark thought it was a bit of mackerel and went in too close.’

Builder Bob Pollard broke the UK record when he caught an 8ft long blue shark off Penzance in October last year.

It was caught 11 miles off the coast and weighed a massive 17 and a half stone. It was returned to the sea alive.

Up to 20 million blue sharks are killed each year by fisherman.

Mr Robertson-Brown added: ‘Sharks are in serious danger all over the world.’
