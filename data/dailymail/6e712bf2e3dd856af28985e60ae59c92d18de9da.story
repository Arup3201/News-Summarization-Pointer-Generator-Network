The Home Office is dragging its feet over plans to reinstate exit checks at borders to tackle illegal immigration, Nick Clegg claimed yesterday.

The Deputy Prime Minister admitted the Government would not meet a pledge to put in a system to track everyone who leaves Britain by 2015.

But he accused Home Secretary Theresa May of moving too slowly and said he was sending in Lib Dem minister David Laws to speed things up.

Checks: Nick Clegg said the immigration system inherited from Labour was a mess, not least because the last government scrapped exit checks to track who had left Britain when their visas expired

His attack comes amid growing 
Coalition tensions over immigration and appeared to be an attempt to hit
 back at Tories who have embarrassed the Lib Dems by accusing them of 
holding back anti-immigration measures.

Mr Clegg had objected to a pilot 
scheme to drive vans around bearing posters telling illegal immigrants 
to ‘Go home or face arrest’.

Urgency: The Deputy Prime Minister revealed he has asked a senior Lib Dem to put pressure on the Home Office on a daily basis

The Lib Dems have also tried to scale 
back plans for immigration bonds – £3,000 payments on top of visas 
issued to visitors from high-risk countries, repayable only upon leaving
 Britain.

The process of dismantling traditional
 exit checks at ports and airports began under John Major’s government 
and was completed by Tony Blair’s ministers.

One obstacle to the exit checks being 
brought back in has been delays to the introduction of a £750million 
e-borders scheme that will electronically collate and store information 
on every passenger entering and leaving Britain by boat, plane or train.

Last month, the Home Office’s senior 
civil servant, permanent secretary Mark Sedwill, told MPs his department
 still aimed to set up exit checks before the election in 2015,

He said: ‘The objective is to have 
exit checks through e-borders and other mechanisms by 2015, so 
essentially by the end of the Parliament.’

But Mr Clegg said: ‘I have been 
concerned with the urgency with which the Home Office is seeking to 
implement the Coalition commitment that I insisted on – that exit checks
 should be restored.

‘I have asked David Laws to chase this through Whitehall day in, day out.

‘Do I think checks will be in all exit places by 2015? That is unlikely because of the complexity of it.

‘But I hope we will be able to demonstrate very significant progress.’

A Home Office spokesman said: ‘The 
Government has made a commitment to reintroduce exit checks by 2015. The
 Home Office will deliver on this.’
