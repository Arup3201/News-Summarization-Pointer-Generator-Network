Lewis Hamilton suffered an embarrassing first day at the office in his new job this morning - slamming his Mercedes into a barrier just 15 laps into his debut for the Formula 1 team.

The British star locked his brakes at 170mph heading into turn six of the Circuito de Jerez in Spain before careering across the gravel trap during the morning testing session.

It was not exactly a dream start for Hamilton, who ended his lengthy association with McLaren at the end of last year to join Mercedes in a deal believed to be worth at least £15million a year.

Hamilton was not injured in the crash, which will come as relief to his glamorous pop singer girlfriend Nicole Scherzinger.

The 28-year-old has recently bought a £20million private jet - with a personalised registration of G-LCDH, standing for Lewis Carl Davidson Hamilton - to ease the pressure of their long-distance relationship.

Today's accident caused the session to be 
red flagged as Hamilton's brand new Mercedes W04 was transported back to
the garage.

Mercedes confirmed the accident damaged the front suspension 
and bodywork.

The brake problem was traced to a hydraulic line connected to the right-rear brake caliper.

'Lewis suffered a loss of rear brake pressure, the front brakes enabled him to slow the car but he couldn't avoid the barrier,' a tweet from Mercedes read.  

'Obvious damage to the front wing and nose; we are checking the car over now. Lewis himself is fine.'

Nico Rosberg completed just 14 laps on Tuesday following an electrical 
fault which led to a small, short fire and the replacement of the wiring
loom on the W04.

Following
lengthy repairs by the team, Hamilton was at least able to make his 
debut on time for the second day of the opening pre-season test at the 
Circuito de Jerez.

Hamilton emerged unscathed from a car
that was soon recovered from the barrier, covered with a black 
tarpaulin and craned on to the back of a flatbed truck before being 
taken back to the garage.

The incident is a blow given Hamilton 
has already spoken of his need to maximise every second in the car ahead
of the season opener in Australia in six weeks as he strives 
acclimatise with his new team following his decision to leave McLaren.

Meanwhile, Sky Sports will screen the 
final pre-season test later this month in 3D. It will be the first time 
the sport of Formula One has been screened in 3D and it follows in the 
path of football, golf and the London Olympics.
