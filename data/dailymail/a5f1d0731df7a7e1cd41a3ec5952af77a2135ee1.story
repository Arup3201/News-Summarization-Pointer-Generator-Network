Usually when the Duchess of Cambridge steps out in recycled outfits, women across the country look on with admiration and think, ‘maybe she is like us after all’.

But after Kate made her first public appearance since giving birth five weeks ago, those approving looks will probably be tinged with a little bit of envy.

Yesterday the Duchess, 31, stepped out in a recycled jacket and blouse, and, sensationally, her pre-pregnancy trademark skinny jeans, revealing just how quickly she has managed to snap back into shape.

As well as the £180 jeans by designer Paige, she wore a £39 sleeveless patterned blouse by Zara – last worn when she was just a few months pregnant – with a £570 Ralph Lauren hacking jacket and her favourite £80 Pied a Terre wedges.

The Duchess hadn’t planned to step back into action so soon, with her first official engagement not scheduled until September 12.

But earlier this week sources indicated that she was considering joining Prince William to officially start a marathon on Anglesey, where the couple have lived for two years.

Kate is understood to have been keen to thank locals for their support and discretion before the couple return to London after William’s search and rescue RAF posting ends next month.

In the end a decision wasn’t made 
until just a few hours before the event yesterday morning, after aides 
were told that ‘little rascal’ Prince George, as his father likes to 
call him, had given his parents a relatively peaceful night.

While
 speaking to locals at the event, the Duchess revealed that her mother, 
Carole – or granny as she called her – had come up to North Wales to 
babysit.

‘He’s doing 
very well. He’s with granny at the moment. He’s sleeping well but I know
 these things suddenly change at a minute’s notice,’ she told fellow 
mother Sarah Bingham, 38.

Marian
 Wyn-Jones, High Sheriff of Gwynedd, said: ‘We were talking about the 
joy she was having from George and how quick he was changing, she 
couldn’t quite believe it. She’s enjoying every minute of it. He’s 
getting quite huge, she said.’

But it seems the Duchess has been finding time to re-start her fitness regime. 

Will
 Stewart, park warden at Holyhead Breakwater Country Park, where the 
gruelling three-day Ring O’Fire race started, said the Duchess told him 
she was ‘genuinely interested’ in doing some more walking around the 
area, ‘especially after the baby’.

He said: ‘She said she wants to get back into shape. I said, “You don’t need to worry about that”. She looked great.’

Although
 aides have remained tight-lipped about her fitness regime, Kate is 
sporty and is known to have kept fit by walking her dog, Lupo, and 
taking part in ante-natal yoga classes, which are said to help women 
regain their figure by ‘training’ muscles to snap back into shape.

Sarah
 Barrett, managing editor of website BabyCentre UK, said: ‘Kate looks 
fantastic – and we wouldn’t be surprised if a little yoga was part of 
her secret.’

As she left the hospital with newborn Prince George, Kate wore a bespoke Jenny Packham dress

The following day as she drove to her parents' home, she wore a maternity dress by Seraphine

Seraphine was again her shop of choice when she posed for the first official family portrait with Prince George

Seraphine sales soar: The dresses have been in demand since they were seen on the Duchess. The floral print version is £50 and the pink £46
