Power brows: For Kim Kardashian's wedding, she created her defined brows with a £15 Dipbrow Pomade, a tinted, creamy formula which prides itself as waterproof, smudge proof and ideal for creating defined, natural-looking brows, from Anastasia Beverley Hills

Anastasia Soare, who is known in Tinseltown as 'the queen of eyebrow shaping', has been revealed as the secret behind Kim's perfectly shaped brows.

For the wedding of the century, Kim's make-up artist used Anastasia's £15 Dipbrow Pomade, a tinted, creamy formula which prides itself as waterproof, smudge proof and ideal for creating defined, natural-looking brows.

Anastasia explained that on the day of the wedding, she also used her Duo Brow Powder in Brunette all over Kim's arches and used Perfect Brow Pencil in Brunette for touch-ups on areas that are naturally more sparse such as the front and ends of the brow.

The brow groomer, who runs Anastasia Beverley Hills and sells her products on Beautybay.com, shared her top tips for achieving Kim's look.

Get the look: Speaking about the product, Anastasia said: 'With a gel-mousse consistency that glides seamlessly, adhering to each individual hair, Dipbrow Pomade is your answer to enviable eyebrows'

She uses the Dipbrow Pomade, which she applies with her £15.50 Brow Wiz, an ultra-fine brow pencil, which claims to fill in sparse brows for a naturally fuller appearance.

She then defines and enhances the brows with her £17 Brow Powder Duo, which is enriched with Vitamins C and E to nourish and protect, before sealing the powder make-up into place with her £15 Beauty Genius Clear Waterproof Gel, which she says seals and waterproofs any loose powder.

Anastasia has also tended to the brows of Oprah, Jennifer Lopez and Madonna.

Kim's make-up artist Mario Dedivanovic, who did Kim's bridal makeup in Florence, recently spoke to the
 MailOnline to reveal the secrets behind her look for the big day.

The star's confidant Mario divulged 
that Kim's perfect pout was coated with an inexpensive tube of 
lipstick by L'Oreal Paris, which retails for around 
£7.99.

The most talked about woman in the 
world also had £13.50 mascara applied to her 
lashes before she looked lovingly into her husband's eyes to say 'I do'.

He used Urban Decay to creating Kim's winged eyeliner that emphasised her deep brown eyes.

For lash beauty, the bride opted for her own Kardashian line of fake eyelashes to give her flutter some emphasis. 

Remember when? Kim Kardashian tweeted a snap of her contoured face and a new beauty craze was born with make-up artists saying the 'Kim K' look is now the most requested

The 33-year-old values Mario's services so much, he was the only one she allowed to apply her makeup for her wedding.

'I was the only make-up artist that did Kim’s makeup,' he divulged.

While
 he doesn't know exactly how long it took to create North's mother's 
bridal look on the morning of her third trip up the aisle, he says it 
usually takes between 20 minutes and an hour to do her makeup.
