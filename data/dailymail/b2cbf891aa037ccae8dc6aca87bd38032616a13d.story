Jeremy Clarkson claims he and his colleagues were forced to hide under their beds after an angry mob of locals came after them when filming in Argentina

Jeremy Clarkson has compared the attack by Argentine ‘thugs’ on his Top Gear team to a violent Hollywood action film.

The controversial presenter claims he and his colleagues were forced to hide under their beds and flee Argentina after an angry mob searched their hotel and tried to attack them.

Locals were seething after Clarkson was filmed driving a Porsche with the number plate H982 FKL, believing it was a reference to the 1982 Falklands conflict.

The incident will form the centrepiece of Top Gear’s Christmas special, in a move that risks escalating the row even further.

It will show Clarkson and his fellow presenters Richard Hammond and James May driving three V8 sports cars 1,600 miles through Patagonia in southern Argentina.

Footage captured on camera phones will show the convoy coming under attack from irate locals in the southern town of Tolhuin.

Clarkson, 54, yesterday compared the attack to a violent scene from John Carpenter's 1976 Hollywood film: Assault on Precinct 13.

In the thriller, actor Austin Stoker plays a police officer who defends a Los Angeles police station from heavily-armed gangsters.

Describing his experience in Argentina, Clarkson said: ‘I'll warn you, it's gruesome. 

'You get the sense that there's a never ending supply of — let's call them “youths" — coming out of the darkness, hurling anything they can lay their hands on.

‘You wouldn't have wanted to be in any of the cars, that's for sure.’

In a Sunday Times article, Clarkson continued to deny that the controversial number plate was chosen deliberately to stoke up a row and push TV ratings up.

‘I've given up telling people that the H982 FKL number plate was a coincidence because absolutely nobody believes me,’ he said.

‘I have the email chains that show exactly why that particular car was chosen — only two were available at the right time for the right price and the other was black, a colour that doesn't work on television.

‘Everyone on the show knows the car was not chosen for its number plate and no one believes them either.’

The presenter admitted that his innocent explanation of the incident was not believed because the stunt was ‘exactly the sort of thing’ which the show is infamous for.

He added: ‘Of course I don't doubt that after the programme is aired many people will say that I should be ashamed of myself for putting all those innocent people in danger and that it really is time for the show to be turned into something more benign — Countryfile with windscreen wipers perhaps.

‘But here's the inconvenient truth. On this occasion, for once, we did nothing wrong.’

Last month the BBC announced that the Top Gear special will sit at the heart of its festive programming – alongside more traditional staples such as Doctor Who, Strictly Come Dancing and the last ever episodes of Miranda.

The announcement of the Christmas line-up came on the same day that Argentina's ambassador to the UK, Alicia Castro, wrote to the BBC Trust expressing 'discontent' with how the number plate fiasco was handled.

Despite the denials, many observers still think the incident was a publicity stunt. Here’s why:

- Top Gear received an email stating the car’s registration before it was bought. The BBC say they did not spot it.

- The numberplate H982 FKL stayed on the car for ten days after the show was warned it was offensive.

- Some filming for the show took place in Ushuaia, from where doomed Argentinian warship General Belgrano set off on her final voyage.

- Argentinian police found another set of ‘joke’ numberplates reading BE11 END in the same Porsche.

- The man who sold the car to the BBC was allegedly gagged by the corporation.

- Argentina accused Clarkson of exaggerating the ‘attack’ on the Top Gear team to improve ratings. 

She claimed Clarkson's behaviour 'fell well below BBC's editorial values and standards' and called for a fresh investigation.

The presenter said: ‘Since our return Alicia Castro has been stoking the fire. Rightly so. 

'That's her job, and she's good at it. She demanded the BBC apologise and scrap the programme, and when that failed she released a series of statements claiming I'd exaggerated the incident and that when we abandoned the cars we tried to set them on fire for ‘dramatic effect’.

‘The message then is clear. We had tried to provoke the Argentinians into some kind of response, and when that didn't work, because they were all at home knitting jumpers and making daisy chains for handicapped children, we had invented some kind of a kerfuffle to boost the show's ratings.’

The footage of the violence will be shown on 27 December as part of the two-part Top Gear Patagonia special on BBC2.

In a departure from usual form, the video will be shown without the customary horseplay and risqué humour, for which the show is famed.

Andy Wilman, Top Gear’s executive producer, said: ‘We’ve been very careful to present it as it happened rather than put an agenda or spin on it. 

'Viewers will make up their own mind.’

The programme has been embroiled in a string of controversies over the years, including accusations of racism after Clarkson apparently mumbled the word ****** during an outtake and referred to an Asian man as a 'slope' during a Burma special.

In 2011, Hammond prompted a complaint by the Mexican ambassador after he suggested a Mexican car would be 'lazy, feckless, flatulent, overweight'.
