Sainsbury's has been accused of 'blatant' hypocrisy today over plans to demolish a First World War war memorial while using an  advert honouring the Armed Forces to boost Christmas sales.

The supermarket giant's controversial festive commercial features the famous Christmas Day truce of 1914 where British and German soldiers met in no man's land to exchange gifts and play football.

But while working on the advert with the Royal British Legion the retailer has also been planning to knock down the Memorial Stadium in Bristol and replace it with a new store.

Anger: Sainsbury's has been branded 'hypocritical' because it plans to remove this Bristol war memorial while running a Christmas campaign with the Royal British Legion

The ground is currently home to Bristol Rovers Football Club, but was built in 1921 in memory of 300 local rugby players who died in the war.

Campaigners say the supermarket is being 'blatantly hypocritical' and have accused it of a lack of respect for the historical sports ground.

Sainsbury's insists it will build a new memorial within the new development using stone from the existing pillars and the inscribed gates. 

Jamie Carstairs, a campaigner against the new supermarket, said: 'Sainsbury's advert is slick, manipulative, artful film making - and also a tawdry, tasteless and inappropriate use of WW1 sacrifices and memories.

'The company has long planned and spent thousands preparing to destroy Bristol's famous war memorial sports ground in Bristol.

'They are reported to want to go ahead with their plans. So, yes, Sainsbury's are indeed being blatantly hypocritical.

'If only they would at least try to understand what the Memorial Ground is, before they destroy it.

'(They) have failed to grasp a basic fact: that the gates on their own do not constitute the war memorial.

'Nor have they shown any understanding that this sports ground is not any old brown field site, it is a war memorial.

'Nor have they appreciated how utterly disgraceful and tawdry and insulting their plans are.'

The stands and the dressing room at the Memorial Stadium were built on fields donated by a local businessman.

It became the home for Bristol Rugby Club but ownership was passed on to Bristol Rovers Football Club in the 1990s.

Vision: The new Sainsbury's store in Bristol will look like this - and the company says that it will contain a new memorial and a memorial square

Magic moment: A British and a German soldier meet in No Man's Land on Christmas Day in the new Sainsbury's advert unveiled last week

Drama: The young Briton is deep in thought and then, to shouts of fear and anger from his comrades, decided to climb above ground

The side, which was relegated from the Football League last season, is trying to sell the ground so it can build a new stadium on the outskirts of Bristol.

But in order to fund the move it needs to sell the Memorial Stadium and Sainsbury's obtained planning permission for a new store, homes and community facilities in January 2013.

The redevelopment will involve demolishing the entire ground, along with the iconic Memorial Gates which are the scene of a Remembrance Service every November. 

Campaigners insist the entire ground represents a war memorial and are furious that the gates are being dismantled.

The £40million project, including the construction of a 4,851 square metre supermarket, also faces opposition because of traffic and noise concerns.

Diana Scrafton, a director at TRASHorfield, a group fighting to preserve the ground, added: 'While the nation watches the emotion-packed advert, the days are numbered for Bristol's largest war memorial.

'This inspiring and poignant sports-ground tribute to 300 soldier-sportsmen who played the 'Greater Game' is to be demolished by Sainsbury's and replaced by a giant superstore.

'How can Sainsbury's do this in the centenary years of the great war while exploiting the pathos of the Christmas truce of 1914?'

But Sainsbury's claims it has acknowledged the importance of the ground and are working on plans to preserve the memorial aspect.

A spokesman for the supermarket said: 'We absolutely refute we are operating double standards.

'We recognise that the site has historical importance which is why our plans preserve the memorial stone and also create a public square dedicated to the memory of former Bristol rugby players.' 

Sainsbury's reconstructed the trenches scenes with the help of a war historian to celebrate the supermarket's 20 years of support for the Royal British Legion, which runs the annual poppy campaign.

While some called it moving and brilliant were saying it was a 'cynical' way for a big business to advertise itself. 

Juliette AdAstra added her concerns, saying: 'If there's anything more tasteless and cynical than the Sainsbury's Christmas advert, I've yet to see it'.

Stephen Bellamy tweeted: 'The Sainsbury's Christmas advert feels somewhat manipulative' and Craig Lewis wrote: 'Companies using the the First World War as an effort to boost sales is disgusting and disrespectful to the fallen'.
