A road safety row has erupted as the Government prepares to turn the M25 hard shoulder into the country’s first controversial permanent traffic lane from next week.

The Highways Agency says the big switch-on will ease congestion on Britain’s busiest motorway – the M25.

But motoring groups say it will put motorists at ‘added risk’. They say the distances between new safety ‘refuges’ are too far apart and there are too few overhead gantries for variable signs.

The new lane system is an attempt to push the roads into a more hi-tech world, with changeable signs and 'refuge points' instead of hard shoulders

Lanes will be controlled  by cameras, variable signs and sensors in a bid to ease the gridlock – and the idea is to be rolled out to other motorways across the UK.

Inevitably, a new generation of hi-tech speed cameras – understood to be capable of capturing speeding cars across multiple lanes -  will police the variable speed limits.

But the AA voiced ‘significant road safety reservations’  and caution fearing that permanent removal of the hard shoulder could increase road safety risks because breakdowns and other emergencies will have to take place in a live traffic lane.

It said the space between refuges – every 1.5 miles – was too great and should be around every 800 yards.

And RAC technical director David Bizley said: ‘We have raised concerns with the Highways Agency about the added risk arising from increased distance between emergency refuge areas, and we are disappointed so far at the absence of action to address them."

The sombre caution is in sharp contrast to the upbeat message from the Government’s Highways Agency crowing that the switch means the M25 will become ‘the smartest’ motorway in the country.

Around 20 miles (32km) of the M25 will feature this hard-shoulder running, which has been trialled, but only at certain times, on various motorways, starting with a section of the M42 in the West Midlands in 2006.

Until now the lanes have had a hard shoulder to allow for traffic to flow even if there is an accident, or for people to take refuge when their car breaks down, but now they are being abolished

From Monday, the hard shoulder between junctions 23 and 25 on the M25 in Hertfordshire will be available for use by vehicles.

Then next month the hard shoulder will be available for traffic between junctions 5 and 6/7 of the motorway on the Kent/Surrey border.

Highways Agency senior project manager John Martin said: ‘Around £1.7billion is being invested into roads in south east England by 2021 with 145 new lane miles (233km) of capacity added.

‘Soon the smart motorway will be complete and we are now asking drivers to get smart and find out more about how to use it, the types of signs and signals they will see and what to do in the event of a breakdown.’

He added: ’This really is the start of a new age on England’s motorways.’

But AA roads policy head Paul Watters said: ‘England’s first ‘all-lane running’ motorway with no hard shoulder  should be treated with caution by drivers. This is the first time the hard-shoulder has been ditched completely.

‘It marks a significant shift in UK motorway policy: rather than conventional widening, ‘making best use’ now uses existing carriageway with technology controlling traffic.

The AA has said the new road rules should be treated with caution by drivers, as they could pose unseen risks

'It is much cheaper but can hopefully safely provide the desperately needed extra capacity to reduce chronic congestion.’

Mr Watters noted: ‘Whilst we welcome the congestion-busting aspects of the scheme the AA has significant reservations.

'Permanent hard shoulder removal means that breakdowns and other emergencies could take place in a live traffic lane rather than the hard shoulder.’

Mr Watters said: ‘New 'smart' motorways depend on drivers complying with the rules of the road and safety advice. Safety also depends on a rapid response to incidents on the part of the road operator and technology.’

Speed limits on the new ‘smart’ section of the M25 will be policed by new  ‘stealth’ motorway cameras which can photograph cars across four separate  lanes.

The new Hadecs 3 cameras – which are almost indistinguishable from conventional CCTV cameras.

They will be mounted on gantries and on poles by the side of the road.

But unlike most speed cameras, they will  be painted a dull grey rather than bright yellow – a move forced on ministers who insisted such cameras were ‘safety’ not revenue-raising, following an angry backlash from drivers.

And there will be no tell-tale calibration road-markings. There will however be signs warning of cameras in operation.

The cameras are also to be used on other of Britain’s busiest motorways including stretches of the M1, M6 and M25.

The Highways Agency insisted they will be ‘visible’ but confirmed: ‘They will not be painted yellow.’

He  accepted that the Highways Agency has ‘gone to great lengths to minimise risk and build-in safety’ but  said it had also ‘cut back too hard’ on the technology used in the M42 pilot scheme.He said: ‘For example, on M25 there will be far fewer gantries and the emergency refuge area spacing is too great at 1.5 miles (2.5 kilometres).

Mr Watters said: ‘A third more road space on one of the UK’s busiest sections of motorway will ease the daily stress of hundreds of thousands of drivers.

However, they will have to come to terms with there being no hard shoulder and a need to follow strictly speed and lane instructions.’In an AA-Populus poll some 63per cent  of the 21,510 respondents agreed they would be more nervous driving on a motorway with no hard shoulder. 

And nearly 9 out of ten (87per cent) also agreed that having hard shoulders are what make motorways safe.

By contrast nearly eight out of ten (77per cent) disagreed that because modern cars are more reliable hard shoulders are not needed.Big jams and gridlock on the M25 have caused it to be nicknamed  ‘Europe’s biggest car-park’,Mr Watters said: ‘At least the drivers trapped by regular chronic congestion on the M25 may breathe a sigh of relief but those unfortunate enough to be stopped in lane one may take a sharp intake of breath on occasions.’

‘Motorways are our safest roads and that is how we want it to stay.’
