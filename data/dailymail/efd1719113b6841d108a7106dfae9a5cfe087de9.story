A docket listing for the state Supreme Court shows the stay was granted on Friday in the case of three-year-old Veronica.

Her
biological father, Dusten Brown, has been fighting a South Carolina 
couple, Matt and Melanie Capobianco, for custody of the girl for years.

Both sides were in a Nowata County 
court on Friday. The Oklahoma Supreme Court granted an emergency stay to
the Nowata court's ruling that Veronica should be transferred 
immediately to the Capobiancos.

Veronica's birth mother put her up for adoption.

Brown
is Veronica's birth father and a member of the Cherokee Nation. He 
fought the Capobiancos' adoption of Veronica under the Indian Child 
Welfare Act.

The stay comes after Brown turned himself in to authorities on August 12, but refused extradition to South Carolina.

That's where Veronica's adoptive parents Matt and Melanie Capobianco live and where state authorities had finalized Veronica's adoption and charged Brown with 'custodial interference' for refusing to turn over the girl.

'This is my daughter,' Brown said, according to Anderson Cooper 360. 'It isn't a yoyo I borrowed for two years.'

Brown posted $10,000 bond and was released on August 12, according to Oklahoma's Sequoyah County Sheriff's Office.

Last week, a lawyer appointed to look out for the best interests of the three-year-old asked a judge to suspend visitation rights for her adoptive parents - a complete turnaround after the South Carolina court awarded the Capobiancos custody of Veronica on July 31.

The James Island, South Carolina parents have been trying to adopt Veronica since her birth in 2009. after which they raised the girl for two years.

But Brown has had custody of his daughter since 2011, when South Carolina's Supreme Court ruled that a 1978 federal law written to ensure Native American children stay with Native American parents gave him preference over the Capobiancos.

In June, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled the law does not apply in this case because the biological father never had custody of Veronica and abandoned her before birth.

Brown had never met his daughter and, after Veronica's non-Indian mother rebuffed his marriage proposal, played no role during the pregnancy and paid no child support after the girl was born.

The legal proceedings began when Brown found out Veronica was going to be adopted. He objected and said the Indian Child Welfare Act favored the girl living with him and growing up learning tribal traditions.

The Capobiancos appealed the South Carolina Supreme Court's 2011 decision to the U.S. Supreme Court, and it ruled in June that South Carolina courts should decide who gets to adopt Veronica. The state court said the Capobiancos should raise the girl.

Last week, South Carolina Family Court Judge Daniel Martin finalized the couple's adoption, approving a transition plan detailing a gradual process for reintroducing the girl to the Capobiancos.

South Carolina authorities issued a warrant for Brown's arrest Saturday, charging Brown with custodial interference for failing to appear with the girl for a court-ordered meeting with the Capobiancos on August 4th â€” a date the couple has said was set by the judge and to which Brown's attorneys did not object.
