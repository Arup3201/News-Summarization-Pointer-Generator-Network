The wife of a Tory minister has hit back at criticism of MPs using taxpayers’ money to employ family members.

Eve Burt, the wife of Foreign Office minister Alistair Burt, said she should not have to defend her job earning up to £40,000 as an office manager, insisting it was ‘legally allowed’.

It comes after new figures showed 155 MPs – nearly one in four – now have wives, children and even parents on the public payroll.

Family affair: Eve Burt, who earns up to £40,000 working for Tory MP husband Alistair, has hit back at criticism of relatives being put on the public payroll

The taxpayer paid out £4million in salaries to MPs’ relatives last year, up from £3.5million in 2010-11.

Among senior Tories enjoying the perk are Justice Secretary Chris Grayling, Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin, Chief Whip Sir George Young and Environment Secretary Owen Paterson. The latter two are millionaires and earn more than £130,000 a year.

Mr Burt first employed his wife 30 years, after he was elected as MP for Bury North in 1983.

He lost the seat in the 1997 election, but was elected MP for North East Bedfordshire in 2001.

Mrs Burt insisted she worked hard 
managing ‘a little team of four and a half staff’, for a salary listed 
by the Commons expenses watchdog as being between £35,000 and £40,000.

The
 mother-of-two complained of the ‘odd hours’ involved in the job, but 
rejected criticism that MPs should not be allowed to put family members 
on the public payroll.

Alistair Burt first employed his wife 30 years, after he was elected as MP for Bury North in 1983.

The 58-year-old trained as a solicitor, and married Eve in 1983 - the same year he entered Parliament.

He rose to become social security minister under John Major, but he lost his seat in the New Labour landslide at the 1997 election.

He was re-elected MP for North East Bedfordshire in 2001, becoming deputy chairman of the Tory party in 2008 and joining the Foreign Office as Middle East minister after the coalition was formed.

The couple have a son and a daughter.

‘My husband employed me 30 years ago. Should I have to defend myself every single day. Probably not,’ she told BBC Radio 4.

‘'I'm not sure I have to defend it at all. It is what it is. We are legally allowed to be employed by our partners or whoever.

‘When you read the newspaper reports it says "propping up personal household income". If it was anybody else it would say "working for a salary".’

The number of MPs declaring that they 
have family members working for them increased by 17 per cent after new 
rules were introduced increasing budgets for staffing.

But
 Mrs Burt insisted: 'It infers that somehow we are not doing a job. I 
think it's done so much because it’s very practical. They work odd 
hours, the hours have changed.

‘It's obviously particularly strange because Alistair is a Foreign Office minister so he is constantly travelling.

‘Most
 of his travel at the moment starts on Sundays so he has to be quite 
often heading to airports in the middle of a Sunday morning.

‘It's
 two-centre working. It's most weekend working. You don't actually have 
many jobs which have quite such oddly structured hours and I think 
that's why families find it quite useful.'

She went on: ‘We work wherever we are 
whenever we need to, as opposed to fitting into some structure of office
 hours, I think that's why it's popular.

‘Constituents
 can phone at any time of the day and night - and they do, and that's 
fine, we provide that kind of service in the office because we can. If 
somebody wants to ring me up at seven o'clock on a Sunday morning to say
 there's something wrong, they can and that's OK.

‘We
 do have a hectic schedule... I'm not moaning, it's what we do. We love 
what we do. It's a fantastic way of life, it's a fantastic job, we enjoy
 the public engagement.

‘But
 I really don't see why I should spend my time defending the fact that 
somebody pays me to do the 37-and-a-half hours in the office every 
week.’

An MP who employs her daughter at taxpayers' expense claimed she would be earning 'less than the minimum wage' if her hours were taken into account.

Nadine Dorries, the outspoken Tory, defended hiring her daughter Jennifer as a constituency caseworker on a salary of £30,400.

She said that the 26 year-old provided 'value for money' as she worked weekends and could always be relied on.

The MP said on Twitter: 'Given the hours she works, she would argue, very strongly that she is on less than minimum wage and abused,' adding a smiley face.

The bill for MPs’ expenses rose by an 
inflation-busting 7 per cent despite David Cameron’s pledge to bring 
down the cost of politics.

The
 17 per cent rise in family employment reflects a rule change that 
allows MPs to spend more on staff and, by using relatives, top up their 
household income.

In 2011/12
 they were allowed to claim only £115,000 a year for staff. But that was
 increased in 2012/13 to £144,000 for London MPs to reflect higher costs
 in the capital. Other MPs claim up to £137,000.

Expenses
 – office outlays and personal costs such as travel and accommodation – 
were up from £91.5million in 2011/12 to £98million, according to the 
Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority.

Spending is now higher than in the run-up to the expenses scandal of 2009.

Matthew
 Sinclair of the TaxPayers’ Alliance said: ‘Any politician using 
taxpayers’ money to employ a relative must be completely open about who 
is being paid, how much and for what.

‘And
 in the light of past abuses, they shouldn’t be surprised when their 
constituents demand more openness if they fail to give a detailed 
explanation as to how they are spending that cash.’

The
 public outcry over MPs employing family members began in 2008, when 
Tory MP Derek Conway was accused of paying his two sons for non-existent
 jobs.

Calls for the rules to be changed intensified after the expenses scandal broke a year later.

Other
 ministers who employ relatives include Hugo Swire from the Foreign 
Office, business minister Michael Fallon, Stephen Hammond at the 
Department for Transport, and Northern Ireland minister Mike Penning.
