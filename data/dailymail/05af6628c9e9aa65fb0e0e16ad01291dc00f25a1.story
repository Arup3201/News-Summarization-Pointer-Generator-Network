A new Christmas advert is set to be the cutest yet.

The 60-second video clip from McVitie's, which cost £1million to make, stars a host of adorable young animals emerging from a box of biscuits.

A fluffy kitten, spotted piglet and duckling all exit the box one by one to the surprise of the family.

Created by Grey London, the advert features the McVitie's Victoria biscuit selection before a host of animals appear from the blue pack.

It is the first Christmas advert created by the biscuit company in more than 30 years and will air for the first time today (Thursday, 4 4) at 7.42pm on E4.

The group of cute creatures includes an Alaskan malamute puppy, piglet, Persian kitten, rabbit, duckling, ginger kitten, pug puppy and a baby hedgehog.

Along with a reindeer calf and even a narwhal - a tusked whale - all the animals emerge from the box.

United Biscuits Sweet Biscuits marketing director, Sarah Heynen said: 'The launch of McVitie's Victoria on our TV screens this Christmas marks another momentous occasion for McVitie's at the end of what has been a highly successful year for us.

'We are delighted to introduce the latest additions to our McVitie's Sweeet family, and hope it brings chocolatey cheer to biscuit-loving households across the UK for the festive season.'

The advertisement is the latest addition to the McVitie's Sweeet campaign, which launched in February this year.

It has seen the company invest some £12million into the adverts in a bid to modernise and increase the brand's profile.

McVitie's hope the cute animals in the Christmas campaign will reflect 'the feeling that we get when we open a box of McVitie's Victoria'.
