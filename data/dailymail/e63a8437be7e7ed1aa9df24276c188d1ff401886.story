A Florida animal shelter has been criticized after staff euthanized an adopted puppy on the day it was due to go to its new home.

The director of the shelter apologized for the error, but it is not the first time Hillsborough County Animal Services has made a fatal error.

In the latest case, one-year-old German Shepherd JoJo was waiting for his new owners to arrive when staff mistakenly put him down on Tuesday.

The error was described as 'regrettable' by the shelter, which cares for about 20,000 animals each year.

In an official statement the shelter said: 'Sadly, JoJo had been selected for adoption and was to be picked up by his new family later that day ... a combination of human errors may have been the cause of JoJoâ€™s euthanization.'

The staff responsible for the tragic error have be reassigned at the shelter as an investigation into how an adopted dog came to be put down is carried out.

'It looks like the file was not cleared 
for euthanasia but the procedure was done,' Hillsborough
County Animal Services director Ian Hallet said told Fox 13.

He said the family had visited the shelter to adopt a puppy, but fell in love with JoJo. After the dog was accidentally put down Mr Hallett contacted them personally and says they still plan to rescue a dog from Hillsborough.

Danielle Yoho, who was in the process of adopting two dogs from the shelter, told Fox 13: 'This is their last chance, this is 
their last stop you can't make a mistake.'

She added: 'There needs to be a triple and quadruple check. Whatever it takes to 
make sure that the dog that is going home goes home.'

JoJo wasn't the first dog to be put down at the shelter despite being adopted by new owners.

In April last year and mixed dog named Zeus, who had been adopted, was accidentally euthanized only an hour after arriving at the shelter.

The shelter has also been criticized over illness at the shelter, including a recent outbreak of Parvovirus, a contagious and potentially fatal dog disease, according to the Tampa Bay Times.

A protest is being organized outside the shelter on October 19, with a combined drive to bring in donations of blankets and toys for the animals to help the facility.

Mr Hallett was brought in as director last year to implement changes at the shelter and try to reduce its high kill rate. About 12,000 animals a year are euthanized at the center.

Since taking over he has extended the center's opening hours to allow more potential adopters to visit the animals being held there.
