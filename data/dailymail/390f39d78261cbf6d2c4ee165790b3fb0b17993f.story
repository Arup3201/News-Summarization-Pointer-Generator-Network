Twin brothers who carried out a £1.6million property scam after promising people foreign properties that did not exist have been jailed for more than four years.

Paul and Peter Aspden were co-directors of a firm called Independent Property Consultants (IPC) based in Scarborough, North Yorkshire, which sold overseas developments to investors.

But the 54-year-old brothers have now been imprisoned, after a court heard they brazenly offered properties in Bulgarian developments and took more than £620,000 from clients.

An Insolvency Service investigation - launched after complaints from clients - discovered those homes never materialised.

Clients had also handed over £1million for apartments in the Sal Vista resort development in Cape Verde which they never got their hands on.

Andrew Haslam, prosecuting, told the court that the charges dated between September 2004 and May 2008.

He said: ‘Some people were looking to invest money and rent out the property while others wanted to fulfil their dream of owning a home abroad.

‘Some invested their life savings and others remortgaged their family home. Paul deceived customers and provided them with wholly false statements on the progress of the build and went on to ask for further money.’

Leeds Crown Court heard that when investors approached Paul Aspden - who held a 75 per cent share of the company - to ask why their properties had not been completed, they were met with excuses regarding the standard of the building work not being satisfactory.

In the Cape Verde development, investors were led to believe that IPC owned the land where the development was to be built - and that their money would be used to fund the development.

'The investors paid over large amounts of money and got nothing in return. All the money paid by investors was spent on buying the land'

Andrew Haslam, prosecuting

Mr Haslam said: ‘Both defendants mislead customers as to the true position of the ownership of the land. The reality of the situation was that their money went to buy the land on which their property was to be built.

‘The investors paid over large amounts of money and got nothing in return. All the money paid by investors was spent on buying the land. Yet again Paul Aspden made wholly false and misrepresentations.’

The court heard that many victims suffered a devastating financial loss from their investment and many of them are suffering from personal health problems as a result.

In a summary of seven investor statements, Mr Haslam told the court that one victim who lost £78,500 is suffering from ill health and depression - and has debts that he is unable to pay.

One 67-year-old victim remortgaged her home and was left with huge amounts of debt, while another victim is now suffering from anxiety.

The court also heard that one victim had to tell her sister that both of them had lost all of their inheritance money left to them by their mother.

'Your recklessness was at the extreme end of the scale. You showed calculated and persistent dishonesty over an extended period'

Recorder Robin Mairs

The fraud involved 72 victims who lost approximately £1.6million.

Sentencing Paul Aspden yesterday, Recorder Robin Mairs said: ‘Your recklessness was at the extreme end of the scale. You showed calculated and persistent dishonesty over an extended period.’

Paul Aspden, of Lytham, Lancashire, pleaded guilty to fraudulent trading in Bulgaria and offered an alternative plea of making a false and misleading statement as to services, contrary to section 14 of the Trade Descriptions Act 1968 in respect of investments in Cape Verde, which was accepted.

Peter Aspden, of Cape Verde but originally from Lancashire, offered a plea of making a false and misleading statement as to services, contrary to section 14 of the Trade Descriptions Act 1968 in respect of Cape Verde only. This was also accepted. The fraudulent trading offence in respect of Bulgaria was ordered to lie on file.

After the case, Detective Inspector Ian Wills of North Yorkshire Police said: ‘Complainants started to come to North Yorkshire Police back in 2009. They were complaining that they had invested through IPC in property in Bulgaria and Cape Verde and retrieved nothing for their investments.

'A huge number of people have nothing to show for their investment. It's caused financial ruin'

Detective Inspector Ian Wills, North Yorkshire Police

‘The investigation kicked off in 2009 and we’ve had the job of unravelling exactly what was going on and where clients’ money was going to and that investigation has taken several years to complete.

‘The way the contracts were structured with IPC was at various points during the build customers were required to pay the next instalment.  A huge number of people have nothing to show for their investment.

‘It’s caused financial ruin and a lot of investors are suffering significant health problems and in some cases it’s caused financial ruin to people whose dreams have been completely shattered by the actions of these two who have lost everything.

‘People aged in their late 60s re-mortgaged their homes and are having to continue working to pay off mortgages they otherwise wouldn’t have had.’
