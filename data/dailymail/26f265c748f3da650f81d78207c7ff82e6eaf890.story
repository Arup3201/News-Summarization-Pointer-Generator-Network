A charity fundraiser claims she was sacked from her job raising money for Guide Dogs because she has a genetic disorder which affects her vision.

Zoe Goodman got a job at Ethicall call centre in Bristol fundraising for the charity by doing telesales.

But after the teenager asked for software that would magnify her computer screen so she could see it properly because of her sight problems, she was told this was not available and not to come back.

'I felt shocked, I felt bullied and I felt patronised,' said the 19-year-old. 

Zoe Goodman, 19, claims she was sacked from her job at Ethicall in Bristol, where she was raising money for Guide Dogs through telesales, because she is visually impaired and asked for specific equipment to help her

'I was being fired from a Guide Dogs campaign for being visually impaired.

'If I didn't have a visual impairment I would still have my job fundraising for the blind.'

Miss Goodman, 19, even asked Guide Dogs for support but claims she was initially told there was nothing they could do to help her.

The teenager has Stargardt's disease, a genetic disorder which can lead to total blindness. Symptoms often start with blind spots, wavy vision and the eyes poorly adapting to dim lighting.

Miss Goodman started working at Ethicall through Red Recruitment in Bristol, beating her targets to raise £150 in her first morning on the job.

But she began to struggle to read the membership information on the computer screen and needed a mouse with a magnifier. 

Ethicall and Red Recruitment Agency, which dispatched Miss Goodman to the call centre, are investigating  

'This was being arranged and I was above target in my first calling session,' she added.

'Unfortunately the technology was not sorted out.'

Red Recruitment then told her not attend work and, four missed shifts later, she received a phone call telling her she was being 'let go' as the technology was incompatible with the software.

When Miss Goodman contacted Guide Dogs for some support in her case she was told there was nothing they could do at first.

Guide Dogs says it is investigating the incident 

Furious, she then posted on the charity's Facebook page. 

'You cannot hide discrimination under the carpet,' wrote Miss Goodman. 'There should be a zero tolerance policy.

'I am absolutely disgusted with Guide Dogs and their lack of integrity.

'I will not keep quiet about this disgraceful behaviour and would appreciate a public apology for being refused support.'

Guide Dogs said it would be investigating.

A spokeswoman said: 'We take any complaint about our suppliers seriously and have robust systems in place to deal with these. We are investigating this matter and cannot comment any further.'

The charity said it required all its suppliers to 'comply with the law which includes discrimination and equality legislation' but refused to answer whether it would continue to use Ethicall while the investigation takes place. 

Guide Dogs also refused to comment on how it felt about Miss Goodman's case or how it would support her.  

Ethicall's managing director Cristy Cunnick said that the company, which employs about 200 people, was not told about Zoe's sight problems.

She added that their current computer system didn't allow for software to magnify the screen but the firm was going through an upgrade to allow this by next year.

Katy Forsyth, director of Red Recruitment, said: 'We are looking seriously into it and a full investigation is under way.

'It would be inappropriate to comment at this stage as we would be at risk of prejudicing the investigation.
