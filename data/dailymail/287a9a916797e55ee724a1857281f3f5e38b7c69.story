Weighing more than four tons and travelling at speeds of up to 25mph, elephant racing is a dangerous game.

Two dozen elephants took part in a 300metre race held as part of the 9th International Elephant Festival in Nepal's Chitwan district yesterday.

The three-day event, held at Chitwan National Park - a world heritage site, also featured one of the world's most unusual beauty contests.

Five elephants, decorated with colourful chalk and paint, went head-to-head to be crowned the most attractive in front of hundreds of visitors.

They were adorned with wreaths and even had their toenails painted before being presented to the crowd.

If beauty was not their number one skill, elephants could also take part in the exhibition football match.

Mahout - or elephant drivers - guided eight animals around the park where they dribbled the ball and shot at oversized goals.

Suman Ghimire, general secretary of the local hotel 
association and member of the organising team, said the extra events have been added to 'make it more interesting' to spectators.

The festival was founded to highlight the plights of elephants in Nepal and promote local conservation work.

It is estimated that since 1911, the population has dwindled from more than 2,000 to only about 200.

Two-thirds of the surviving elephant population live on the national park.

The park is also home to 400 one horned rhino, as well as a number Bengal tigers.
