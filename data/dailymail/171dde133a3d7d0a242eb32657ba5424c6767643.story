At least two people are dead and 29 are injured after the roof of a mall under construction collapsed in Tongaat, north of Durban in South Africa.

Builders were working on the half-finished three storey site when the second floor fell in.

Rescue teams are using cranes, sniffer dogs and torches to look through the football pitch-sized complex as the search for any more survivors stretches into the night.

'The dogs are now combing the area for survivors,' police Lt. Mandy Govender said. 'There’s just chunks and chunks of concrete and we don’t know what’s underneath.'

'In all my years as a paramedic I have never seen anything like this,' said one rescue worker, running to the site carrying oxygen canisters. Others used hydraulic jacks to lift the slabs and grinders to cut through the metal.

'You can’t see anything, and you can’t hear anything. The generator is making so much noise,' another rescue worker said.

Large crowds of onlookers and anxious friends and relatives gathered in the darkness behind a security cordon.

The injured, including two of them in critical condition, were rushed to nearby hospitals, which initiated full-scale disaster plans, health officials said.

At least one person was killed and dozens were feared trapped under rubble last night

The deputy mayor of the municipality 
that includes Tongaat said construction should not have been taking 
place because contractors were not doing a proper job, the South African
Press Association reported.

'We took them to court a month ago,' Nomvuzo Shabalala said. 'We thought they had stopped.'

There were initial reports that up to 50 people were trapped in the debris.

Police were checking names, and said some workers reported as missing may have left the scene before notifying authorities.

Deputy Mayor Nomvuzo Shabalala said local authorities had tried to halt construction at the site, alongside a railway, a month ago.

'We took them to court a month ago,' he said. 'We thought they had stopped.'

'There are areas of the law that they did not follow in terms of building of this infrastructure,' He told broadcaster ENCA. 'We were not aware that they were continuing building.'

The identity of the builder was not immediately known. 

Collapse: The shopping mall in Tongaat, north of Durban, was still under construction when it collapsed

Rescue: Around 100 emergency service workers are said to be on the site recovering victims

Survivors: Two of the survivors stand at the scene where a mall collapsed, as other workers are still missing

Authorities appealed to residents in the area to stay away from the scene so that rescue teams could work more quickly.

Fiona Moonean, a resident whose house 
is located across a railway line from the collapsed part of the mall, 
said she was washing dishes at the time of the incident, SAPA reported.

A few days earlier, Moonean said, workers had started to remove the scaffolding.

'Just after 4.30 pm, it was a thunderous sound. Before the bang, I heard too much scaffolding fall,' Ms Moonean told SAPA.

'The whole concrete slab crashed down with the pillars.

'The smoke and dust was too thick. I heard them screaming out for help in Zulu.'

She called emergency services and a woman took down her details, according to SAPA.

Tongaat: The city, near to the hometown of President Jacob Zuma, has had a construction boom in recent years

Trapped: About 50 workers are feared trapped under the roof, with at least 17 others injured

Large: The mall is expected to be at least 15,000 square metres and will house 40 retail stores

'She
had to calm me down because I was so freaked out,' Ms Moonean added. 
'For me, the most traumatic is the sound of the guys’ voices. That is 
the part that plays in my head.'

Television footage showed police and 
rescue workers walking over large piles of rubble and twisted metal 
lying next to a railway track.

Chris Botha, a spokesman for the Netcare 911 emergency service, said the second floor of the structure had given way.

'The scene is extremely horrific... concrete big blocks have fallen on to people,' he told broadcaster ENCA from the scene.

'The guys are busy using hydraulic rescue equipment to break through the concrete and get to some of the patients.'

If safety regulations are found to have 
been breached, the accident could sour already fraught labour relations 
in South Africa’s construction sector and might have ramifications for 
the ruling African National Congress as it moves towards an election 
next year.

Reports coming in suggest there could be at least 29 seriously injured and potentially two dead

Durban: The mall is in Tongaat, just up the coast from Durban on the east coast of South Africa

Television footage showed police and rescue workers walking over large piles of rubble and twisted metal lying next to a railway track. Large parts of the building had completely given way.

Ambulances ferried the injured to nearby hospitals, which initiated full-scale disaster plans.'There are no really severe injuries,' said Jenny Meer, manager of the Mediclinic Victoria hospital in Tongaat that had admitted eight patients.

'It’s mainly broken bones, soft tissue injuries and a bit of shock. But obviously there are a lot of patients that are still trapped on site,' she said.

Emergency services spokesman Botha said others were more seriously injured.

Durban and the surrounding province of KwaZulu-Natal is the home of President Jacob Zuma.

The region has enjoyed a massive construction boom in the last few years, based in part on huge government investment in infrastructure improvements.
