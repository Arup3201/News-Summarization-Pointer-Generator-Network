Team news

QPR 

QPR will be without Alejandro Faurlin for the visit of Sunderland after the midfielder suffered a serious knee injury for the third time in three years.

R's manager Harry Redknapp could yet be without Faurlin for the remainder of the season after he sustained an anterior cruciate ligament injury - whilst loan signing Eduardo Vargas will be unavailable as he is still awaiting a work permit.

All over: Alejandro Faurlin could miss the rest of the season after suffering a serious knee injury

Charlie Austin (hamstring) missed the 4-0 loss at Tottenham last weekend but could be involved on Saturday as Redknapp is likely to recall a number of players who sat out the Capital One Cup defeat to Burton.

Provisional squad: Green, Murphy, Hill, Dunne, Ferdinand, Onuoha, Caulker, Yun, Simpson, Traore, Isla, Henry, Barton, Fer, Mutch, Hoilett, Phillips, Wright-Phillips, Taarabt, Austin, Remy, Zamora.

Sunderland

Sunderland head coach Gus Poyet faces a series of selection decisions ahead of Saturday's Barclays Premier League trip to QPR.

Poyet has no fresh injury concerns, but having made six changes for the Capital One Cup second round victory at Birmingham in midweek, has options at his disposal.

Eyeing recall: Jack Rodwell (right) scored his first Sunderland goal against Manchester United last week

Costel Pantilimon, Billy Jones, Liam Bridcutt, Adam Johnson, Jordi Gomez and Jozy Altidore all started at St Andrews, but Vito Mannone, Patrick van Aanholt, Lee Cattermole, Jack Rodwell, Will Buckley and Steven Fletcher will hope for recalls at Loftus Road.

Provisional squad: Mannone, Pantilimon, Jones, Van Aanholt, Brown, O'Shea, Vergini, Roberge, Cattermole, Bridcutt, Rodwell, Gomez, Larsson, Johnson, Buckley, Giaccherini, Mavrias, Wickham, Fletcher, Altidore, Graham.

Key match stats (supplied by Opta)

Loic Remy scored his first Premier League goal at Loftus Road in this fixture two seasons ago.

Wes Brown scored the winning goal (in the 89th minute) the last time Sunderland won a league game at QPR (December 2011).

QPR have yet to score a league goal this season and have scored just once in their last eight Premier League games overall.

Harry Redknapp has won just two of his 14 Premier League home games as Rangers boss (D5 L7).

QPR have scored 37 goals in 39 Premier League home games since August 2011. 

Going down fighting: Despite going on to be relegated, QPR defeated Sunderland 3-1 at Loftus Road in their previous clash in 2013, with Andros Townsend (front) getting on the score sheet

Loic Remy has made a league-high 18 touches in the opposition box this season, one more than Swansea have in total.

Harry Redknapp won four of 22 Premier League games in his ill-fated spell at Southampton; so far he has won four of 27 in the top-flight with QPR.

The players to feature for QPR this season have a combined 2307 Premier League appearances; only Everton (2896) & Man Utd (2334) have more.

Loic Remy has scored QPR’s last three Premier League goals, but the most recent one came in May 2013.

After scoring five goals in three Premier League games, Connor Wickham has now gone five Premier League appearances without one.
