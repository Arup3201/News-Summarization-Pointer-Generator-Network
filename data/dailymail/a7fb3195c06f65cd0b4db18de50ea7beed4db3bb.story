Â A Florida teacher was fired from her job last week after she allegedly encouraged six students to attack a classmate that spoke back to her.

Teacher Dru Dehart was fired on Thursday night from her position at Port St. Lucie's Northport K-8 school by the St. Lucie County school board, WPTV reports.

Dehart was accused last year of encouraging a March 2013 incident caught on surveillance video that showed six students attacking classmate Radravious Williams, WPBF reported last year. The attack took place after Williams allegedly told Dehart that he 'wished he could curse out teachers someday.'

In turn, Dehart allegedly told the boys they should 'teach him a lesson,' the channel says.

Latasha Darrisaw, the boys' mother, described the assault in detail to WPBF last year.

'They picked him up, carried him, holding him by the neck, took him down to her classroom and forcibly made him apologize to her.

'And her remarks to him were, "I've got my eighth-grade boys on you; you're not so tough now."'

Dehart was removed from the classroom last spring and transferred to a different position without student contact, WPTV reported at the time. She was later suspended without pay in fall 2013.

Following Dehart's termination, Darrisaw told CBS 12 that Radravious has trust issues.

'Through the whole process, and even when I got the news there's no congratulations on ether side, he's suffering and my son is still suffering.'

She also told the channel that Dehart has yet to apologize the attack on her son.

'As a person and as a parent you would like some kid of apology, but I guess we will get that whenever she's ready,' Darrisaw said.
