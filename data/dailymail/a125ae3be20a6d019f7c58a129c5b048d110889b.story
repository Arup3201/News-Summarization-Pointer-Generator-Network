With her wrinkle-free skin, glossy dark mane and mega-watt smile, Annemarie Leak, 54, certainly isn't your average grandmother.

Now
the Lincolnshire former model and Liz Hurley lookalike has been crowned
the UK's most glamorous grandparent and credits her success to being 
celibate for more than 10 years.

But although remaining single has kept her looking young, divorcee Annemarie, who claims she used to be an 'ugly duckling', revealed that she is searching for love.

'I was married in 1984 but then divorced by 1988 and have been single for most of my adult life,' she revealed.

'Men
are not top of my list but it would be nice to have a man on my arm to 
take me to these events, I have got so many nice clothes to wear.

'I
think it has proved that looking good is not always good. I don't know 
what it is, maybe men have never known how to approach me.

'There
was never much interest in me when I was at school either, I used to 
think I was the ugly duckling, but maybe the boys are scared of me.

'I don't know what it is about us, neither of my daughters are married either. I
have found relationships really difficult, I had the occasional 
boyfriend when I was younger but it only lasted a couple of months at a 
time.'

Success: Before marrying, she had a successful modelling career and was crowned Miss Lincolnshire in 1982

Similar: In the 1990s, she forged a career as a Liz Hurley lookalike, even wearing the Versace safety pin dress

'I spent a lot of time of time on my own and I was quite isolated. I
was engaged to another man before I was married but the whole 
relationship only lasted six months - I just couldn't go through with 
it.'

Despite her relationship issues, Annemarie eventually met and married her husband - and the father of her two equally beautiful daughters.

'I met my husband in 1983 and we had a rocky romance - he just used to get so jealous, he was a pain,' she reveals.

Now Annemarie says she is happy with her decision
to turn her back on men, and unless the perfect partner comes along, she plans to concentrate on modelling. 

'Here I am having a second bite at the cherry and I am not going to let anyone stand in my way,' she insists.

'My husband, who was seven years older, used to stand in my way with beauty competitions and say they weren't suitable. I just wanted a proper family life, that is what I set out for. 

'The
relationship put me off men forever and I have been celibate for 13 
years now. I think not having that pressure has made me stay looking and
feeling young.

'I have a lot of barriers but I just don't think I have ever found the right man, there is a problem with the physical side. I find being affection very difficult, I can't even hug my own mum. 

'But
I don't want to be a little old lady with a dog and a cat - I suppose I
am looking for someone but they have got to be right. 

'I want to find someone who has something in common with me, someone who is outgoing, likes going to see films and the theatre. I think my ideal man would be a cross between Jon Bon Jovi and Sean Connery.

'I am looking for love but I don't go on dating sites - who knows what the future might hold though.'

Until
she unearths the perfect partner, Annemarie plans to continue with her 
modelling career, which was given a new lease of life when she won the 
UK's most glamorous grandmother pageant.

For the event, she wore a 1950s inspired dress 
and performed a nursery rhyme with her granddaughter four-year-old Myah.

New career: Annemarie now hopes to build on her success and forge a second successful modelling career

Annemarie,
who looks after Myah full time, added: 'My daughter noticed the ad for 
this competition in the summer and encouraged me to enter.

'I always had the philosophy that if you don't enter you don't get. Everybody tells me I look very good for my age. I try to go for the old glamour like Dita Von Teese and I adore the Audrey Hepburn style.

'I think the judges were impressed with my outlook more than anything. I hope I inspire other women my age so they realise they are not too old to be glamorous. I'm lucky because I can still eat what I like and do very little exercise.'

Instead
she has one green smoothie a day which includes spinach, celery, 
lettuce and lemon juice and enjoys having an number of regular beauty 
treatments.

Annemarie said: 'I do have a gym membership but I don't use it, I just look after myself with facials and massages every week.

'I
also have regular trips to the hairdressers but I go to the hair 
college so it doesn't cost very much because my daughter is setting up a
beauty salon so I get treatments from her as well.'

Now
she thinks her success with the latest competition means she could make
a career out of being a film extra and in television commercials.

Annemarie has already appeared as an extra in Clash of the Titans in 2009 with Katarina.
