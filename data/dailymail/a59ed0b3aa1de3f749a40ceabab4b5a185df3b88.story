If you yawn and the person next to you follows suit, don’t worry – you are not boring them.

Rather, it is a good sign, for it means they really like you.

A scientific study suggests ‘contagious’ yawns are a sign of deep empathy. They are caused by an irrepressible need to share and understand the emotions and feelings of others.

If you yawn and the person next to you follows suit, they might like you, according to new research. The ‘catching yawn’ is caused by an irrepressible need to share and understand the emotions and feelings of others, scientists said

The ‘emotional bridge’ created by the shared experience enhances social bonding, the Italian scientists say.

Researchers
 who monitored 33 adults over 380 hours, recording 1,375 yawns, found 
that a yawn was far more likely to spread – and did so more quickly – 
among friends and relatives.

The scientists also tracked the way yawns spread among bonobos, the species of chimpanzee most closely related to humans.

They
 monitored the apes for 800 hours, and found that a yawn ‘wave’ was just
 as likely to be triggered among bonobos as it is in humans.

The impact of friendship, however, was not evident among the chimpanzees.

The study suggests that contagious yawns are a sign of deep empathy.

The ‘catching yawn’ is caused by an irrepressible need to share and understand the emotions and feelings of others.

The ‘emotional bridge’ created by the shared experience enhances social bonding, according to Italian scientists.

In an experiment, they found that a yawn was far more likely to spread among groups of friends.

The researchers concluded that human ability to feel empathy is far stronger between friends and relatives.

 Biologists believe contagious yawns are caused by an involuntary re-enactment of the facial expression seen in others.

They
 think ‘mirror neurons’ in the pre-frontal cortex - the brain region 
involved in social behaviour - fire when certain expressions are seen in
 other people, prompting us to instinctively copy them.

The
 new research suggests that this ‘mirror system’ is strongest between 
people who are emotionally attached, probably by shared memories.

A yawn was just as likely to spread between unrelated primates as it was between family members.

The researchers concluded that human ability to feel empathy is far stronger between friends and relatives. 

They
 wrote in the journal PeerJ: ‘Humans’ responses were more frequent and 
faster when the trigger and responder shared a strong emotional bond.

'Humans show a different degree of sensitivity... but only when they are strongly emotionally involved.’

The
 scientists, from universities in Pisa, Parma and Rome, believe the 
difference between humans and bonobos is most profound when it comes to 
the strongest of our social bonds, particularly those shared with 
friends and family members.

But when it comes to strangers, the results suggest we possess no more empathy than the apes do.

British scientists have previously found that babies and young children are immune to waves of contagious yawning.

Research
 by psychologists at the University of Stirling, published in 2010, 
established that after the age of 11, children react to yawns in the 
same way as adults.

Yawns are also contagious in groups of apes, but don't signify friendship
