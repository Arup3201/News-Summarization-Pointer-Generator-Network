Head lowered against a black background, and with a frown creasing his brow, this portrait of Winston Churchill captures the great man at his lowest ebb.

It is a far cry from the iconic images of Britain's charismatic wartime leader in his trademark bowler hat, holding his fingers in a 'V' for Victory sign, or puffing on a fat cigar.

But William Orpen's haunting portrait is the one Churchill himself treasured most, with the then 41-year-old describing it as 'the picture of a man's soul'.

'Haunted soul': The artist William Orpen captured Churchill in his political 'wilderness years' in the wake of the disastrous Gallipoli Campaign

Churchill sat for artist William Orpen in 1916 – as Britain was counting the human cost of the disastrous Gallipoli Campaign the then First Lord of the Admiralty had championed the year before.

Irish artist William Orpen was an official war painter of the First World War, producing renditions of privates, dead soldiers and German Prisoners of War as well as official portraits of generals and statesmen.

Churchill sat for Orpen on 11 occasions in 1916, an experience the artist is said to have found tense and difficult given the state of mind of his subject.

Nonetheless, the final work met with the approval of Churchill, who upon seeing the painting is said to have told Orpen: 'It is not the picture of a man. It is the picture of a man's soul.'

The suffering Orpen witnessed during his time as a war painter is said to have affected him deeply, and critics have attributed an occasional 'shallowness' in his portraits to emotional exhaustion in the wake of the Great War.

The artist was made a Knight Commander of the British Empire (KBE) in the 1918 King's birthday honours list.

He died in London aged 53.

Having crashed out of Government, he likely suspected his hitherto glittering political career would never recover.

That the catastrophe weighed heavy on Churchill's shoulders is evident from the gloom that permeates the portrait, and the artist described his subject as a 'man of misery'.

But Churchill - who would go on to earn his place in history as arguably the greatest British prime minister - said Orpen's painting captured a glimpse into his very soul.

Upon seeing the piece, Churchill is said to have told the artist: 'It is not the picture of a man. It is the picture of a man's soul.'

The rarely seen life-size painting - which hung for years in the home of Churchill's late grandson - is now on display to the public in the National Portrait Gallery.

The London gallery unveiled its new addition this week after securing the painting on a 10-year loan from Churchill's estate.

Aside from a brief period on display at the Imperial War Museum in 2005, the 'deeply personal' portrait has remained within the Churchill family.

The National Portrait Gallery said the painting captures a 'moment of crisis' in Churchill's career.

Sandy Nairne, director of the gallery, said: ‘I am very pleased that the Churchill 
family has agreed that this outstanding portrait by William Orpen of 
Winston Churchill, the nation's greatest 20th century statesman, should 
now be on public display.’

The portrait is 
displayed prominently in the early 20th-century room, 
illustrating Churchill’s significance in the context of the First World 
War, the gallery said.

V for Victory: Iconic images of the indomitable 'British bulldog' are far removed from the more vulnerable side of Churchill captured in Orpen's portrait

Up to the dark hour captured in Orpen's portrait, Churchill's path to success had been relatively smooth.

Born
 into the aristocratic family of the Dukes of Marlborough, as a young 
man he joined the British Army and proved his talent as a writer - 
attracting acclaim as a war correspondent.

He
 made his first foray into politics as Oldham MP in 1900, rising swiftly
 to hold several senior positions before being appointed First Lord of 
the Admiralty under Asquith's government in 1908.

It
 was in this position that, after war broke out in 1914, Churchill 
pushed for the Gallipoli Campaign that would end in disaster and the 
loss of thousands of troops.

In November Churchill put forward his plans for a naval attack on Dardanelles in Turkey, a move based at least in part on what would turn out to erroneous reports regarding Ottoman troop strength.

The attack - designed to open up a path for the British Army to invade the Gallipoli peninsula and go on to take the Ottoman capital Constantinople - was opposed by military chiefs, but Churchill argued successfully for the plan to go ahead.

Losses: British, Austrialian and Indian troops in the Gallipoli landing at Cape Helles on April 25 1915

A joint British and French campaign was duly mounted to secure Constantinople - now Istanbul - and secure a sea route to Russia.

There was a delay of more than six weeks before many of the troops arrived from Britain, allowing Ottoman forces time to prepare defences for a land assault, and the landing date of April 25 was leaked in advance.

Allied troops sustained devastating losses during the landings as the Ottomans furiously defended every inch of their soil.

The attack then lost momentum after the initial landing with most troops remaining on, or not far from, the beaches, thus allowing the Ottomans time to bring in reinforcements.

The campaign rolled on but Allied troops to achieve their initial objective proved unsuccessful and casualties mounted.

In the wake of the failed August Offensive the campaign - increasingly unpopular with the British public - entered a hiatus period and Allied soldiers were eventually evacuated.

By the close of the campaign in January 1916 more than 200,000 Allied troops had been killed.

At the time of Orpen's portrait Churchill was preparing to defend himself against charges of reckless and incompetent leadership before the Dardanelles Commission.

The Commission went on to conclude that he was not personally responsible for the failure of the mission, and Churchill eventually returned to the political front line at the outbreak of the Second World War, going on to be widely regarded as one of the great wartime leaders of the century.
