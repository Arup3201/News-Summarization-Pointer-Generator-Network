Detectives say they have apprehended a 'person of interest' in the horrific murder of New York Red Bulls soccer coach Michael Jones -- who was slashed and stabbed on the sidewalk in an attack so brutal that his ear was hacked off.

Police are currently interviewing the man who they believe was captured by security cameras calmly walking away from the spot in New York's Greenwich Village where Mr Jones, 25, was found dying about 4.30am Sunday.

Mr Jones was reportedly returning to a friend's apartment after night of visiting upscale clubs when he was attacked.

Video shows Mr Jones walking with his suspected killer. An argument ensures before the attacker slashed Mr Jones' throat and stabbed him in the abdomen and chest.

Victim: Football coach Michael Jones, 25, was stabbed numerous times in the savage attack

Shocking: The sidewalk in a bustling area of the West Village in New York City is stained with Mr Jones' blood, marking the spot where he died

Mr Jones, a native of Liverpool, 
England, was beloved by the young soccer players he coached for the Armonk United youth soccer team in Westchester, New York. Friends and
co-workers said he had a gift for the game.

'He coached two of my three sons and was just a great guy. He cared about what he did, and was very dedicated,' Mark Fischer, who oversees referees in the Westchester league, told the Post. 'The kids loved him.'

Officers are still trying to figure out what provoked the horrendous killing and why Mr Jones was seen walking down the street with the man at 4am after leaving his girlfriend earlier in the night.

Police say he began the evening spending time with his girlfriend at the apartment of one of her male friends on West 14th Street in Greenwich Village.

Mr Jones left her about 11.30pm and said he was planning to meet a friend at the Standard Hotel bar in the Meatpacking district.

Is this the killer? The suspect, seen in this surveillance video, is described as a man between 25-30 with a dark ponytail

However, police say, he said he couldn't get into the club to he went to the Park nightclub on 10th Avenue, instead.

He called his girlfriend several throughout the night. The last phone call was made as he was headed back to her friend's apartment, where the couple was apparently spending the night.

Minutes later, at 4.15am, he was captured on surveillance video walking down the sidewalk with the suspect.

Mr Jones is seen arguing with the suspect before the attack.

Mr Jones' body was found at 4:25am, his ear lying a few feet away.

Officers
covered the ear with a plastic cup to hide it from passersby and rushed
the man to Bellevue where he was pronounced dead on arrival.

Night out: Michael Jones was staying with a friend on West 14th Street, not far from where he was attacked, on Sunday. He first visited the Standard Hotel and then the Park nightclub before returning to his friend's apartment

'It was a frenzy. The guy was chopped multiple times,' a police source told the Post. 'He cut the guy's ear off. It doesn't get any more personal than that.'

In a statement released on Sunday, 
the Red Bulls said: 'We are aware of this tragedy and on behalf of the 
entire organization, want to send our most heartfelt condolences to 
Michael’s family, friends and loved ones.

'He
was a tremendous individual, a fantastic coach who loved soccer and a 
terrific friend for many of us. This is truly a sad day for our soccer 
community and we will do our utmost to help authorities in their 
investigation of this case. Our thoughts and prayers are with Michael's 
family at this time.'

Witness said that Jones, 25, 
who lives in West Harrison, New York but comes from Liverpool England, 
was so mutilated that they believed it was a Halloween prank.

'We thought it was a Halloween joke or something because his phone was 
there, so maybe if we tried to get his phone that he’ll pop up or 
something,' a witness told CBS News York.

Another disturbed witness said: 'I never, ever, ever seen nothing like this. Ever.'

Police are still trying to determine a 
motive for the gruesome murder but do not believe it was a robbery as 
the victim's iPhone was still at the scene, covered in blood on the 
ground.

No arrests have been made in the ongoing investigation.

Residents of the West Village neighborhood who consider it a safe residential area are stunned.

'It's horrible. I've been living here my whole life,' said Sarah Cohen, 22, a chef who lives nearby. 'People are starting families here. There are religious institutions. How are we supposed to have all that if we can't keep residents safe?'
