Police and leaders of an orthodox Jewish group in Brooklyn say two little girls from their community have been missing since January 31.

Authorities are seeking the whereabouts of Riva, 4, and Yosefa Kutsy, 3, from the Crown Heights area of Brooklyn.

While the girls are believed to be with their mother and father, Alan Velvel Kutsy and Chana Yehudis Kutsy, the parents are not supposed to have left town with the girls.

According to WABC, the girls disappeared with their mother and father after the Administration for Children's Services said it wanted to talk to the family.

The couple had been given only 'trial custody' of the girls for unknown reasons, reports Col Live.

'By leaving with them they didn't follow the conditions put in place,' said Detective Raymond Weng of the NYPD 71st Precinct.

Along with police, members of the tight-knit orthodox community in Crown Heights have asked for the public's help in getting the girls home.

'We are involved in this case for over a year,' Gadi Hershkop, a member of the community public safety group Shomrim, said on Sunday. 'We need those kids back home in Crown Heights as soon as possible to a safe and loving home.'

Police said the couple could be driving a red 2001 Toyota 4-Runner with New Jersey license plate A68EMS.

Shomrim's search efforts have expanded beyond New York and into New Jersey and elsewhere along the East Coast.

It remained unclear whether the children were in any danger. Also unclear was the reason the couple had lost full custody of the girls. 

The girls are believed to be with their parents, Chana Yehudis Kutsy and Alan Velvel Kutsy. The couple had only trial custody of the girls and have broken the terms of that custody by taking off
