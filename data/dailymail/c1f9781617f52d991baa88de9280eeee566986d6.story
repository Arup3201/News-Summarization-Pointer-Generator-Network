War of words: James Middleton, 25, has struggled with reading and writing all his life

When James Middleton walked down the aisle of Westminster Abbey to deliver his reading at the marriage of his sister – to a global television audience of two billion – he had more reason than most to be gripped by anxiety.

He knew the eyes of the world were upon him but it was his own struggle with reading that was his biggest concern.

His reading turned out to be a masterclass in measured oratory, made all the more remarkable by the fact that James still struggles to read because of his dyslexia – a broad term to describe a common learning difficulty.

As a boy, even reading to a class of his peers terrified him. To ensure a word-perfect delivery at Westminster Abbey, he had to rewrite the biblical text into a version he could understand.

Speaking now to raise awareness on behalf of the British Dyslexia Association, he recalls: ‘I had to retype the whole of the reading phonetically, and that’s how I learnt it.

‘In that way I became confident in it, and then I felt I was perfectly capable of doing it. At the end of the day, whether it was in a little church or Westminster Abbey didn’t matter, it was me, as a brother, doing a reading for my sister and her husband at their wedding and I wanted to do it right.’

As anyone who watched him will surely agree, the words were moving. The speech was followed, naturally, by an enormous sense of relief. ‘Yes, there was definitely a big sort of sigh afterwards,’ he says, smiling.

Indeed, today, James, 25, appears every inch the confident young businessman, but this comes only after years learning to manage his dyslexia, which he was formally diagnosed with at the age of 11.

Word perfect: But when the moment came, his reading was spot on without a hitch

Long before that, problems with reading and writing had been flagged up by his teachers. At primary school in Berkshire, James recalls being given extra lessons, and being issued with magnifying bifocal spectacles to help letters on the page stand out.

‘I was fine with numbers but it took me a longer time to grasp simple things like spellings,’ he says. ‘I used to spell everything phonetically, or  I would have little tricks for words I could not figure out.

‘So “said” was Sally Anne Is Dead, and “because” was Betty Eats Cakes And Uncle Sells Eggs. Words that had double letters completely baffled me. At that stage it wasn’t a particular issue though – I just found it a bit of a pain to have these extra lessons because I wanted to be outside playing.’

At 11, his struggles were such that he was asked to sit a  literacy exam, after which he was formally diagnosed as dyslexic. ‘There was some relief in that, because a lot of the strain comes from trying to hide it,’ he says.

By 13, however, enrolling at Marlborough  College – the prestigious fee-paying school his sisters attended – stepped up the pressure.

‘Spelling and reading are something you’re expected to be able to do by then, so if you struggle at them, it’s not the easiest,’ he says.

‘I even had a little rhyme to learn how to spell Marlborough as my father said I would never get in if I couldn’t even spell the name of the school.’

In common with other children with literacy issues, James dreaded any form of public performance.

‘When I read out loud in class it was a joy for everyone else because I would mispronounce things so badly,’ he recalls. ‘I used to try to count how many  people were in front of me and then work out which paragraph I would have to read out and start trying to learn it. And I would sit there thinking, “Please let the bell go so that it doesn’t get round to me.’’

‘There was a certain amount of teasing but I built up a bit of resilience and I was competent in other areas. There were other boys in the same boat, too.’

Many dyslexia sufferers struggle with concentration and retention of information but James – whose maternal grandfather was dyslexic – says that these were never real difficulties for him. His coping strategies centred on painstaking preparation and, on occasion, smoke and mirrors.

‘I realised that if I could write the first two letters of the word then put a squiggle, as if it was bad handwriting, people would fill in the gap,’ he recalls.

Nothing, however, could erase the 
horror of exams – not even being allotted extra time. ‘Exams are the 
most crucifying thing for someone who is dyslexic because you feel you 
cannot justify yourself, it does not reflect your true capacity,’ says 
James. 

‘It’s 
frustrating because it’s not a lack of understanding: you almost need to
 write your own question about the topic so you can really show what you
 can do.’

Dyselxia is one of the most common learning disorders, according to Dr John Rack, head of research for Dyslexia Action.

One in ten people in the UK has  the condition to some degree, with  it running in families.

Most experts now agree on its central symptoms.

‘An accumulation of evidence shows that core difficulties centre in the way language is processed,’ says Dr Rack.

‘In particular, there are problems with analysing and breaking down spoken words, which also seems to lie at the root of dealing with problems with written words.

'This is what makes learning to read particularly difficult.

'Alongside that, it is quite likely you are going to find trouble concentrating, or the inability to retain a lot of information at the same time.

‘Probably only half of those diagnosed have severe difficulties where they need a lot of support – for the rest it’s entirely manageable.

‘For anyone with dyslexia, if  you get help and learn to develop coping mechanisms and strategies, you can almost  always find a way through.’

Dr Rack believes that genetic screening is not an entirely distant prospect. ‘We know dyslexia runs in families and we know quite a bit about some of the genes involved in passing it on,’ he says.

‘Imaging studies show there are different degrees of connections and patterns in the language area of the brains of those with and without dyslexia.

‘Although this is not something we can currently use diagnostically, there is exciting research into very early indications, even in babies.That could potentially lead to  well-timed intervention.’

And so, 
despite hours of study,  his A-level grades were not good enough to 
secure a university place, meaning retakes at a local sixth-form 
college.

It was, he admits, a tricky period, 
particularly for his mother and father. ‘I used to say that I didn’t 
fail the exams, it was the exams that failed me. It was my teenage ego 
saying that, but actually it’s sort of true,’ he says.

‘But it didn’t 
make things easier at the time: I had very capable sisters who had 
succeeded in exams, then I came along and naturally my parents didn’t 
know what to do because I applied myself really well to work, and they 
fully were expecting me to go to university – as did I.’

Successful retakes allowed him to 
take up a place at Edinburgh to study environmental geosciences and 
rural resources management in 2006. Yet after two weeks, James says, he 
knew university wasn’t for him.

‘I knew I was going down the wrong 
path. I stayed for a year, but then I made the decision to leave. It was
 against everyone’s advice because I’d retaken my exams to try to get in
 and then there I was giving it up.  But I never feel I dropped out – I 
was just ready to move on and do something different.’

The
 decision meant giving up  his independence to move back home. But this 
only boosted his determination to create his own  success story.

Within
 a few months he had started his own business, the Cake Kit Company, and
 now runs a parallel business, Nice Group, which specialises in 
personalised cakes.

‘I didn’t look back really,’ he says. ‘University is great but it wasn’t right for me.’

These
 days, he says, he is entirely comfortable with the fact he is dyslexic,
 even if it does mean committing the occasional professional blooper.

‘I
 had 1,000 business cards printed this year, but I had to throw them in 
the bin because I spelt “personalised” wrong,’ he reveals. ‘Not ideal, 
given the thing I do is personalised cakes. But I just looked at it and I
 could not see it.

‘I do make lots of spelling mistakes 
still – for a time the word “corporate” on my website was spelled 
“coprate”. But I’m not embarrassed. The way I see it, it is part of me. 
The key is to become completely confident about it.’

Having this outlook
 could be helped by earlier diagnosis, and some experts believe that 
genetic screening for the condition will eventually be possible.

For James, the notion is a welcome one, although he maintains he would not change the man he’s become. ‘If I had a choice I would still choose to be dyslexic, because I feel it helps me see things in a different way,’ he says.

‘There is a talent in dyslexia, it can help you see things creatively. So I wouldn’t change a thing.’
