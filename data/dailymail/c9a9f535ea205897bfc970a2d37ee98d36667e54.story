Justin Bieber has been 'non-stop crying' as he battles the fallout over two damaging video clips that show him making racist comments.

The troubled teen idol was plunged into a new racism row after a video clip emerged of him changing the lyrics of a song to joke about killing a ‘n*****’ and joining the Ku Klux Klan.

And today, a source close to the 20-year-old singer told MailOnline 'Justin's been in tears. But he knows he needs to take responsibility for his actions, he's confronting his past and he's hanging out with his real friends and his parents.

Making an escape: Justin Bieber jetted out of Mexico on Tuesday as a second video of him using racist terms emerged on TMZ

The popstar was caught on camera at the age of 14, in a video which has just now been released by TMZ,
 changing the words of his song One Less Lonely Girl to sing 'one less 
lonely n*****' - and joking about joining white supremacist group the Ku
 Klux Klan.

He apologised, saying: 'Facing my mistakes from years ago has been one of the hardest things I've ever dealt with.

'But I feel now that I need to take responsibility for those mistakes and not let them linger.

'At the end of the day, I just need to step up and own what I did.'

Justin's team consider bad influence pals to include rappers Lil Za and Lil Twist, both of whom used his LA home as a bolthole and were seen behind the wheel of his sportscars.

This latest 
controversy comes after Justin apologised 'for offending or hurting
 anyone with my childish and inexcusable behaviour' after 
another video clip was revealed of him using the n-word five times.

The source said it was 'almost a relief' that the video clips had been made public as Bieber's camp first knew they had been leaked three years ago.

The clips were bought by TMZ, who never released them before this week. This fresh clip is believed to have been stolen while Bieber was filming his first movie, Never Say Never.

And the source added: 'Justin seems to have ditched the problem people around him and he's trying to pull himself together. He's cleaning himself up.'

It apparently came about when Justin saw a comedian parodying his song online and he then copied the comedian.

However,
 TMZ reports he knew  'almost immediately it was a stupid thing to do' 
and confessed to mentor Usher and close pal Will Smith.

Usher showed him old racist videos to educate him and Justin is said to have seen the error of his ways.

What's more, TMZ
 reports that the Young Money Entertainment clan, which features the 
likes of 'Lil Wayne and Birdman – who Justin regularly hangs out with – 
are supporting the Never Say Never hitmaker.

Mack
 Maine, President of Young Money, is quoted by the website as saying: 
'Bieber does not have a slave mentality.  He treats his people with 
respect.'Meanwhile,
 Justin has claimed that people have tried to extort him over the two 
videos which have recently leaked but he 'says he will not be shaken 
down anymore. He says he wants people to see the video and he wants to 
accept responsibility.'

The footage of Bieber telling a racist joke was made public on Sunday 
after he refused to pay $1million to the person who had obtained it. The singer was held to ransom over the clip, TMZ has said, by a man who had copied it from a computer hard drive belonging to the singer.

Sources
 told the website that the star's reps were contacted two months 
ago by a lawyer, who represented a client who had worked on the his 
videos.

TMZ states that the lawyer said he'd sell the video to 
the media unless Bieber forked out $1million, which was quickly refused.

The price was allegedly later dropped to $800,000 and then $500,000.

But the seller was 'sent packing' by Bieber's representatives as they felt the video of him telling a racist joke 'was not that harmful' because he was only 15 when it was recorded.

The news emerged on the same day that the hitmaker was spotted boarding a private jet, after a brief stay stay at a swanky villa in Mexico.

'I thought it was OK to repeat hurtful words and jokes': The 20-year-old, pictured in the clip, blamed his actions on ignorance, but he insisted he's learned his lesson

On Tuesday,  The Sun
 shared the new clip which shows the Canadian singer, wearing a dog tag 
and a dark blue shirt, changing the words to his 2009 song One Less 
Lonely Girl in order to use the n-word.

A
 source told the newspaper: ‘Unfortunately this is the devastating 
reality of how Justin has behaved and reveals his attitude toward such a
 deeply emotive subject.

‘People
 need to see this. Normal kids in society do not make these kind of 
jokes. He is protected by a network of staff, but the camera doesn’t 
lie.’

On Monday, the Mail reported how Bieber faced a backlash from his fans after the clip of him saying the n-word leaked on TMZ.

It is 
believed that both clips dating back to 2009 are from the same video. They will be seen as likely to prove particularly damaging to his career because of the help 
he has received from African-American artists.

The Canadian star is signed to RBMG 
Records, the label owned by black singer-songwriter Usher Raymond, while
 he has performed with a string of black singers and rappers including 
Will.i.am, Nicki Minaj and Lil Wayne.

Bieber apologised for the clip this week, saying that when he was a child he did not realise how certain words could hurt, adding that he had learned from his mistakes.

Apologised: The first video showed Bieber in 2009 telling a racist joke but he has apologised

He said: ‘As a kid, I didn't 
understand the power of certain words and how they can hurt. I thought 
it was okay to repeat hurtful words and jokes, but didn't realise at the
 time that it wasn't funny and that in fact my actions were continuing 
the ignorance.

‘Thanks to 
friends and family I learned from my mistakes and grew up and apologised
 for those wrongs. Now that these mistakes from the past have become 
public I need to apologise again to all those I have offended. I'm very 
sorry.

‘I take my 
friendships with people of all cultures very seriously and I apologise 
for offending or hurting anyone with my childish and inexcusable 
mistake. I was a kid then and I am a man now who knows my responsibility
 to the world and to not make that mistake again.

‘Ignorance has no place in our society
 and I hope the sharing of my faults can prevent others from making the 
same mistake in the future. I thought long and hard about what I wanted
 to say but telling the truth is always what's right.

‘Five
 years ago I made a reckless and immature mistake and I'm grateful to 
those close to me who helped me learn those lessons as a young man. Once
 again, I'm sorry.’
