Yorkshire and Scotland have been chosen among the top places in the world to visit in 2014 in a 'best-of' booklet by travel guide company Lonely Planet.

Scotland was voted the third-best country to go to next year in a list headed by Brazil, with Antarctica second.

Yorkshire came third in the list of top 10 world regions for 2014.

The guide said Scotland, which hosts next summer's Commonweath Games as well as golf's Ryder Cup, had 'never looked so good'.

Lonely Planet describes Edinburgh as 'the most gothic city outside Transylvania' and encourages travellers to 'take the high road to Loch Lomond, Loch Ness and Cairngorms National Park and fall in love with the landscape that inspired poet Robert Burns'.

Lonely Planet's Best in Travel 2014 contributor Tom Hall said: 'Next year Scotland will be well-deservedly taking the spotlight on the world stage.

'The country's buzzing cities and stunning scenery have plenty to offer visitors, combined with an incredible calendar of events and Scotland looks set for a year-long celebration.'

Alluding to the Olympics success of UK competitors from Yorkshire, the guide said of the northern England county: 'If the good people of Yorkshire were proud of their heritage before, the 2012 London Olympics only served to cement what they have always thought: that their county is better than - and really the best of - all the English counties.'

The guide went on: 'In 2014, this welcoming region of rugged moorlands, heritage homes and cosy pubs will be able to hold its head even higher when the Tour de France begins its grand depart from Leeds.'

With football World Cup host Brazil being seen as the best country to visit next year, the Sikkim area of India was chosen as the best region to go to.

Paris was the top city in a list that also included Cape Town, Shanghai and Chicago, while the Greek Islands were seen as the best-value destination.

Best family travel spot was Denmark, while Cappadocia in Turkey with its 'fairy chimney' landscape was the best honeymoon destination.
