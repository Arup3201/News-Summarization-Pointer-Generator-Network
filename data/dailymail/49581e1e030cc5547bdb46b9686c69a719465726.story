The parents of missing Madeleine McCann will today mark her tenth birthday with a low-key  gathering for family and friends.

Kate and Gerry McCann will join well-wishers in praying for the return of their daughter, who went missing on holiday in Portugal when she was three.

The McCanns have decorated the front gates at their home in Rothley, Leicestershire, with green and yellow floral tributes, symbolising hope.

Unending grief: Kate McCann seen here in Praia da Luz last week

In a TV interview last week, Mrs McCann said: ‘The family will get together and celebrate, which is wonderful, but Madeleine should be here.

‘We still celebrate her and her being part of our lives. I go into Madeleine’s room and I don’t even have to talk – I can just think. It’s as it was really and I’m not ready to change it.’

The McCanns try to keep life as normal as possible for the sake of their eight-year-old twins, Sean and Amelie.

‘We always include Madeleine in everything. She is in my head and my heart every minute of every day,’ Mrs McCann said.

Gifts will be laid in Madeleine’s bedroom, which has remained untouched since she vanished.

Mrs McCann, 45, said it was full of photographs, drawings, unopened Christmas stockings and birthday gifts.

The
 former GP returned from a visit to Portugal on Wednesday during which 
she lit a candle in the church in the resort of Praia da Luz and prayed 
for Madeleine’s return. 

The McCanns said their spirits were 
lifted last week when three young women, who had been missing for up to 
ten years, were found alive in a house in Cleveland, Ohio.

They said it 
had given them fresh hope that Madeleine is still alive. She disappeared
 from the family’s holiday apartment in the Algarve just over six years 
ago.
