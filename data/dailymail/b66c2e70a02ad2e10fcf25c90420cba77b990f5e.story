A rare TV appearance of the last surviving person to witness the assassination of Abraham Lincoln's assassination has turned up on YouTube.

The video is from a February 1956 episode of the TV game show I've Got a Secret.

The show involved a notable person with a celebrity panel whose job it was to guess the secret behind what made the guest so famous.

Injury: Seymour, who was 95 years old at the time, has a bandage on his head after he had fallen down the stairs at his hotel

Revelation: Mr Seymour tells Moore his secret as it flashes on the screen for the audience viewing at home

The video begins with host Garry Moore walking backstage to help an elderly man make his entrance.

The man, who has a bandage on his head, introduces himself: ‘Samuel J. Seymour. I’m from Maryland.'

Great Emancipator: Lincoln was shot dead by John Wilkes Booth at Ford's Theatre in 1865, when Mr Seymour was five years old

Moore explains that the man had fallen down some stairs in his hotel room and gave himself a black eye.

'We urged him not to come onto the show tonight as a matter of fact. We finally got in touch with his doctor, and the doctor said it was up to Mr Seymour. Mr Seymour said he wouldn’t miss it, so here he is,' Moore says to applause.

The secret flashes on the screen: ‘I saw John Wilkes Booth shoot Abraham Lincoln (April 14, 1865).'

Mr Seymour appeared on the show about two years after his story was written in the pages of the Milwaukee Sentinel, in which he recounted the day Lincoln was assassinated.

Moore, speaking for Mr Seymour, said that the man, who was five years old at the time, did not realize Lincoln had been shot, only that he saw a man jump from the balcony.

That man, of course, was John Wilkes Booth, the assassin.

'I was scared to death,’ Mr Seymour says.

Although the celebrity panel was able to guess the secret, Mr Seymour was given the $80 prize and a can of Prince Albert pipe tobacco for appearing on the show.

Mr Seymour died on April 12, 1956, about two months after appearing on ‘I’ve Got a Secret.’
