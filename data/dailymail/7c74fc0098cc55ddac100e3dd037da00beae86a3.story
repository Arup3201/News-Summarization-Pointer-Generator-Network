Vladimir Putin faced a walkout by MPs today as he was addressing parliament in the latest sign of growing dissent against the strongman.

It came the prime minister and president-elect, who  mockingly refused to intervene in a hunger strike by a politician over an allegedly rigged mayoral election in the southern city of Astrakhan.

Dozens of MPs from the Just Russia opposition party left the chamber complaining of Putin's ‘rudeness’.

Glowering: Russian Prime Minister and President-elect Vladimir Putin scowls after MPs walk out of the Duma

The scowling strongman: Despite the once unthinkable defiance by opposition MPs, Mr Putin continued to deliver an aggressive speech in which he also described Nato as a 'Cold War relic'

The faction's mayoral candidate Oleg Shein has been on hunger strike for 27 days and there are concerns over his health.

Two dozen supporters are also refusing to eat.

They alleged Putin's party United Russia 'stole' the election by fiddling the ballots, an accusation that is denied.

The walk-out - unthinkable until recently - came when president-elect Putin told MPs: ‘Your colleague Oleg Shein started the hunger strike but did not appeal to court. This is a bit strange. Why go on hunger strike?’

But Shein claims the authorities barred him obtaining key evidence to back his case in court.

His supporters also claim the city is run by a ‘mafia system’ and the courts are biased.

Putin also today called on Russians to have more children to halt a declining population.

‘For Russia every person counts today,’ Putin said.

‘A strong, happy family with several kids is what the state, society, religious, educational and cultural organisations should unite their efforts around.

‘We should realise that we will come face to face with a serious challenge - the demographic echo of the 1990s when Russia experienced its severest drop in birth rates.

'We need new decisive steps when it comes to saving and caring for people.’

And he called on Russians to cut down on cigarettes, vodka and illegal drug use.

‘Smoking, alcohol and drug abuse - without any wars or calamities - claim 500,000 lives of our countrymen every year,’ he warned.

‘This is simply a horrific figure.’

During his address, Putin also called NATO a relic of the Cold War but said he supported letting the alliance use a Russian airport as a supply hub in support of its mission in Afghanistan.     

Moscow is studying a request from the Western alliance for use of facilities at an airport in the Volga River city of Ulyanovsk as a transit point for shipments of non-lethal supplies to and from Afghanistan by air, rail and road.   

Russia has allowed Afghan-bound NATO transport through its territory since 2009 as an alternative to convoys through Pakistan, which have been subject to militant attacks, but no permanent facility was involved.     

‘I consider NATO ... a throwback to the Cold War era. It was created at a time when there was a bipolar system of international relations,’ said Putin, who has frequently criticised the alliance and its eastward expansion.     

But, in his last address to parliament as prime minister before his return to the Kremlin next month, Putin dismissed fears that NATO's use of the Ulyanovsk facility could represent a threat in Russia's heartland.

‘There will be no NATO base there,’ he said, but only ‘a hop over pad’ for military cargo transit.    

‘Therefore I assure you that nothing unusual, not corresponding to our national interests, is happening there. On the contrary, everything that is being done in this sphere fully corresponds to the national interests of our people,’ he told parliament's lower house.    

In remarks that suggested Russia does not intend to decrease cooperation in Afghanistan, Putin said ‘in some cases NATO is playing the role of a stabiliser in global affairs’ and included the Afghan mission among such cases.        

The Soviet Union fought a disastrous war in Afghanistan and Russia ruled out sending troops to aid the U.S.-led invasion after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, but Putin - president at the time - offered the use of Russian airspace and other support.
