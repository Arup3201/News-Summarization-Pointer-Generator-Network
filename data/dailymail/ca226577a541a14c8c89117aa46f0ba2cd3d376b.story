Thousands of motorists faced the ultimate test of their patience today as they were caught in a major traffic jam that brought parts of the M25 to a standstill.

People who were hoping to get an early start to the weekend instead faced bumper-to-bumper traffic as the busy motorway that encircles Greater London became a car park.

Queues of vehicles stretched more than 13 miles while motorists crawled along the western part of the M25 between junction nine and junction 15 near Heathrow Airport.

Nightmare: Queues of vehicles stretched more than 13 miles on the M25 near Heathrow Airport

Lengthy delays of more than 60 minutes were reported at the height of the traffic jam, which comes a week before travellers hit the roads in massive numbers for the summer bank holiday weekend.

An earlier car fire contributed to some of the tailbacks closing the anticlockwise carriageway at junction 13 for Staines and junction 14 to Heathrow.

The blue BMW 4x4 burst into flames just after midday and left the busy section of motorway completely closed for just over an hour.

All lanes were reopen by 2pm but the build-up in traffic is thought to have added to the chaos.

Crews from Surrey Fire and Rescue arrived on the scene shortly after and the road was closed for an hour

Motorists can expect more congestion and delays during the mass exodus a week from now. 

Frustrated drivers and passengers who were caught in today’s traffic jam turned to Twitter to vent or pass the time.

One user wrote: ‘105 minutes in a traffic jam on the M25 with two children in the back. I've made myself two mugs of tea at once to recover.’

Another user said: ‘traffic on M25 has been described today as 'diabolical'. hours to get anywhere. avoid if you can.’ [sic]

Traffic remained busy through rush hour this evening, with traffic reportedly moving by 7pm.
