She was spotted in London on Thursday with a pram that cost a staggering £1,450.

But, within 24 hours, Tamara Ecclestone has ventured out into the capital with her baby daughter Sophia pushing a second pram, a Bugaboo Cameleon3, £819, in as many days.

Just like her cars, it seems just one ride isn't enough.

Here we go again: Tamara Ecclestone seen pushing her other pram, a 
Bugaboo Cameleon3, £819, on a stroll with pampered princess Sophia

Wearing a pair of leggings and a blue 
fleeced top, the new mother looked healthy and happy as she walked 
through Kensington Palace Gardens

The heiress - who is married to Jay 
Rutland - made her public debut with their little girl on Wednesday but 
obviously doesn't want her pride and joy to be seen in anything but the best.

Bugaboo is the popular choice for new parents, but while it may be significantly cheaper than her blingtastic Silver Cross, it is still a premium choice, with the cheaper models starting from over £400.

Wearing a pair of leggings and a blue fleeced top, the new mother looked healthy and happy as she walked through Kensington Palace Gardens.

Matching her look with a pair of blue and white trainers, she has clearly snapped back into shape after giving birth less than one month ago.

But onlookers will question Tamara's need for a secondary pram given how indulgent her other one iswith Swarovski 
crystals.

While it is not clear just how much 
pram's customisation cost, just the Silver Cross - the iconic Balmoral 
pram - itself costs a staggering £1,450.

And
 while there are several companies in the UK who offer the 
customisation, it wouldn't have come cheaply for the heiress to get the 
pram changed to her liking.

However, Tamara didn't actually pay for her pram herself as it was a gift - from her sister Petra.

Only the best! Tamara Ecclestone and Jay Rutland stepped out with daughter Sophia in a customised, crystal-encrusted pink Silver Cross pram in London on Wednesday

The Balmoral pram has been popular among celebrities for years, with stars including Lily Allen splashing out on the designs for their children.

It not only looks good but boasts a hand-sprung chassis, is cushioned with leather suspension straps and features handspoked wheels.

The transport also includes a lever operated brake system, a soft foam mattress for maximum comfort and an extremely large chrome shopping basket.

While the pink hood and apron come as standard on the pram, it is the crystallised pink and silver detailing on the body of the pram that Tamara would have had to pay extra for.

The pram also features a silver nameplate which read 'Sophia' on the front - just in case there is any doubt as to who is belongs to.

Despite only giving birth to Sophia on 17th March, Tamara already appeared to have snapped back into shape.

Are you ok in there? Tamara and Jay couldn't help but coo over their little charge mid-stroll

In 1877, inventor William Wilson created Silver Cross because of a lack of suitable buggies for his own children.

He opened a small workshop in Silver Cross Street, Leeds, where he grew the business with the help of his three sons.

In 1913, it became the official royal pram, and a special edition was created and sent to George VI for Princess Elizabeth, who is now Queen.

After moving to larger premises, an old silk factory in Guiseley, it has grown to a worldwide brand, with more than 10million parents having bought one in more than 50 countries.

Tamara's Balmoral pram from the Vintage Collection costs £1,450. The Kensington style starts at £950.

The 29-year-old socialite showed off her post-baby body in a striped black and grey jumper with a pair of three-quarter length black leggings and pink Nike trainers for the outing on Tuesday.

With her make-up and hair completely flawless, it's hard to believe that Tamara is a first time mother.

Speaking to Hello! magazine recently about parenthood, Tamara said: 'Motherhood is the best thing that's ever happened to me, and I'm enjoying every minute of it.

'I knew I would love it - I just didn't know how much. I feel born to be a mother.

'Although I've always wanted children, 
I've never felt that intensely before. But Sophia has turned my world 
upside down in an amazing way and I've never been happier.

'Having my own
 family with Jay is just perfect.'

How did she do that? Tamara already appears to have snapped back into shape, less than three weeks after the birth of her daughter

Jay looked equally relaxed for the jaunt, keeping a protective arm around his wife's waist as they walked along.

Within hours of welcoming Sophia into
 the world, Tamara and Jay announced the birth of their first child by 
uploading an intimate shot of mother and baby onto the former reality 
star's Instagram page.

She
 wrote alongside the immaculate snap: 'Welcome to the world Sophia, our 
beautiful baby girl, born yesterday 6lb 9oz. Proudest day of our lives, 
never felt love like this. X.'
