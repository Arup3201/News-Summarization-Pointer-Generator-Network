More than 1.7 million people have signed a Change.org petition demanding that an investigation into the judging decisions in Thursday night's women's figure skating competition be opened.

On Thursday night, Russian 17-year-old Adelina Sotnikova won the figure skating gold medal over reigning Olympic champion Yuna Kim, 23, from South Korea.

Sotnikova finished with a total score of 224.59, beating Kim's score of 219.11 by 5.48 points after the free skate program, becoming the first female Russian skater to win in the category.

Kim would have been the third woman in history to defend her Olympic gold medal after her landslide win at the 2010 Vancouver Olympics where she beat her closest rival by 23.06 points.

However, that title eluded her when Sotnikova was announced as the gold-medal winner with Kim in second and Italian Carolina Kostner with bronze.

The reaction was immediate and vocal, with more than 700,000 people signing the petition within six hours.

Many called for greater transparency in the judging panel, which was overwhelmingly made up of Eastern Bloc nations.

One of the judges, whose votes were 
anonymous, was Yuri Balkov of the Ukraine who was caught on camera 
trying to fix an event at the 1998 Winter Olympics in Nagano.

Another, Alla Shekhovtseva, is married to the head of the Russian figure skating federation, reports USA Today.

Critics
 pointed to another Russian skater in the competition, Yulia 
Lipnitskaya, who fell more than once during her program yet still 
managed to beat American Ashley Wagner, who came in seventh.

'I feel gypped,' Wagner said at a news conference Thursday.

'People don't want to watch a sport where you see people fall down and somehow score above someone who goes clean.'

The current scoring system rates the 
technical elements of a skater's routine, then the execution and 
presentation using a cumulative system.

The
 most problematic impact of the system is that judges are now allowed to
 give their scores anonymously, Eric Zitzewitz, an economist at 
Dartmouth University who has studied judging bias, told ABCNews.com.

Judges'
 tendencies to inflate scores for athletes from their own countries and 
trade votes with other judges has increased 20 per cent since the rules 
were changed in 2004, according to Zitzweitz.

Stoic: Kim did not question the judges' scoring of her program at the press conference following the figure skating finals

Kim herself remained above all the fuss being made over the alleged robbery of her second Olympic gold medal.

'The scores are given by the judges, so I am not in the right position to comment on it,' Kim said. 'There’s nothing that will change with my words. The biggest thing was I felt relieved because it was over.'

Sotnikova seemed oblivious to the questions raised over her win.

'I won. It's my gold medal. I can't believe it,' she said. 'Two years ago, all of my competitions were very bad. I didn't know if I had what it takes to be successful. Now I know that I do.'
