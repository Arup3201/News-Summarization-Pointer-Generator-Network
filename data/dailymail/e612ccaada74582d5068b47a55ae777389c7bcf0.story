Zimbabwean president Robert Mugabe has called David Cameron ‘satanic’ for suggesting that Britain may withdraw aid from developing nations that discriminate against homosexuals.

The 87-year-old tyrant told a group of young people: ‘Do not get tempted into homosexuality. We will punish you severely.

‘It becomes worse and satanic when you get a Prime Minister like Cameron saying countries that want British aid should accept homosexuality.

Mugabe, who has previously compared homosexuals to animals, branded David Cameron as 'satanic'

‘To come with that diabolical suggestion to our people is a stupid offer.’

Mugabe referred to previous remarks in which he compared homosexuals to animals.

He added: ‘It [homosexuality] is condemned by nature. It is condemned by insects and that is why I have said [homosexuals] are worse than pigs and dogs.’

Gay sex is illegal in Zimbabwe, and two same-sex individuals caught even holding hands face prison. Many other African countries take a similar line.

Last month Mr Cameron said he believed British funding to developing nations should in future depend on recipients’ record on human rights.

Mugabe is the latest in a string of African leaders to criticise the proposal, which some governments have argued is an attempt to impose British values on other countries.
