Envy: 38 per cent of neighbours eye up next door's garden, looks, jobs and social life

Whether it’s their cars, their homes or even their bins, it seems we just can’t help eyeing up our neighbours’ lifestyles.

And now, according to a study, the desire to keep up with the Joneses has reached epidemic proportions – with 38 per cent of Britons admitting they can’t stop peering over the garden fence.

The poll by energy firm E.ON found our top priority is sizing up next door’s back garden but we also rate our neighbours on their looks, jobs, social life and car.

An eco-friendly 16 per cent even find themselves getting competitive about how much the neighbours recycle.

One in eight of those who like to keep an eye on their neighbours' lifestyles confessed to comparing their DIY skills – and the same number judged which of their neighbours had managed to raise the best-behaved children.

The research suggests that even in the age of social networking, we still tend to compare ourselves with the people who live close by.

Around 31 per cent said they have changed their behaviour in a bid to fit in with their neighbours.

Despite this, 57 per cent said they would feel mortified if anyone found out, with just 15 per cent opening up about their copycat behaviour.

Anthony Ainsworth, from E.ON, said: 'Our research shows it’s common to compare ourselves to our neighbours to see how we stack up.

'Indeed, millions of us have actually changed the way we behave as a result of these comparisons.'

Cars, DIY skills and recycling habits are among the other factors we envy in families down the street

And psychologist Jo Hemmings said: 'An important part of feeling secure, relaxed and comfortable is believing we fit in well with our surroundings – which particularly applies in our local neighbourhood.'

She added: 'We don’t always want others to know we’re comparing, so having a sneaky peek at our neighbour’s garden or their physical appearance can help us modify our own lifestyles.

'This enables us to feel a greater sense of belonging.'
