John Bercow faces being ousted as Commons Speaker by an anonymous letter writing campaign in Parliament.

A Commons motion has been drafted condemning his ‘increasingly erratic behaviour’ and accusing him of failing to ‘live up to the tradition of impartiality’ of his predecessors.

The one-page letter, seen by MailOnline, has been circulated in Parliament in an attempt to step up pressure on the 51-year-old to quit.

A Commons motion has been drafted accusing John Bercow of failing to ‘live up to the tradition of impartiality’ of his predecessors, and demanding an immediate search for a replacement

The anonymous letter is thought to have been sent to several MPs and journalists in Parliament

Criticism of Mr Bercow has mounted in recent weeks, after he has appeared to repeatedly mock David Cameron in the Commons and faced accusations of being rude to staff.

Aides to the Speaker were forced to deny he told outgoing Commons Clerk Sir Robert Rogers to ‘f*** off’.

One of the most bizarre exchanges came this week, as Mr Cameron took questions during a lengthy sessions on Gaza and the Malaysian Airlines MH17 atrocity.

Mr Bercow interrupted proceedings to say: ‘Somebody asked how long the statement would run, but I would just point out, if I may, that there is intense interest in it and that the frequency of the Prime Minister’s tennis playing on the one hand and his jogging regime on the other means that he is quite fit enough, I am sure.’

The incident could have proved to be the final straw for whoever is behind the draft motion calling for Mr Bercow to quit.

It also accuses the Speaker of ‘systematic bullying and humiliation of staff’, something Mr Bercow denies.

The Early Day Motion criticising Mr Bercow has not been formally tabled, and does not appear to have been signed.

It states: ‘This House regrets that the Speaker has failed to live up to the tradition of impartiality established by his predecessors; notes his increasingly erratic behaviour; condemns his systematic bullying and humiliation of staff, which has no place in modern society, and especially not in a Parliament which should set a national example; and therefore resolves to proceed immediately to the election of a new Speaker, in which he shall not be a candidate.’

Tory MP Michael Fabricant last week accused Mr Bercow of telling the Commons Clerk Sir Robert Rogers to 'f*** off'

A similar motion was used by Tory MP Douglas Carswell to help to unseat the last Speaker, Labour MP Michael Martin, in June 2009.

Tory MP Michael Fabricant, who denies being behind the letter, said at the weekend: ‘Parliament deserves better than hot-headed, unpredictable and foul-mouthed John Bercow.

"The sooner we get a new Speaker, the better. Bercow should go,’ he wrote in the Mail on Sunday.

It followed his claim in the Commons that Mr Bercow swore at Sir Robert.

The Speaker immediately denied the allegation about Sir Robert Rogers, saying: ‘I’ll ignore that last observation which suffered from the disadvantage of being wrong.’

But Mr Fabricant stood by the claim, declaring he does not believe things should be ‘swept under the carpet’.

Earlier this year Mr Bercow tried to humiliate Mr Cameron in the Commons by cutting him off mid-sentence.

During raucous exchanges at Prime Minister's Questions, Mr Cameron was shouted down by Labour MPs and interrupted by Mr Bercow.

As the PM tried to protest that he had not finished, the Speaker hit back: 'He can take it from me that he is finished.' 

Last year relations reached such a low that MPs designed badges with three bees pictured, to show they were members of the BBB club: ‘Bol****ed By Bercow’.
