Former Manchester City footballer Carlo Nash was caught doing 140mph on a dual carriageway and told police 'I'm just trying to get home'.

Nash, who has also played for Everton and Stoke City, is now facing a driving ban and a heavy fine after police pulled his Merceds Benz over at Wymondham, Norfolk.

The 40-year-old, of Leftbank, Manchester, did not appear at Norwich magistrates' court yersterday, although papers about the case were served in May.

Val Attenborough, chairman of the bench, found Nash guilty in his absence and adjourned the matter until August 5 when he will be sentenced.

Nash, a devout Christian, already has nine points on his licence for speeding, the court heard.

Ian Fletcher, prosecuting, said Nash was caught speeding just before 11pm on the 70mph dual carriageway on February 2.

Mr Fletcher told the court: 'He was travelling at a very high speed and the officer followed the vehicle to check his speed over 1.5 miles.'

After being told he was doing twice the speed limit, Mr Fletcher said Nash told the officer: 'I'm just trying to get home.'

Mr Fletcher said Nash had six points for speeding on his licence from July last year and had a further three points for an offence in August 2012.

Road safety charity Brake today said drivers like Nash posed a massive threat to other motorists and should be punished.

Spokesman James McLoughlin said: 'Breaking the speed limit by any amount is a serious offence.

'But drivers who travel well above the speed limit are taking huge risks and are putting themselves and other road users in grave danger.

'This sort of selfish behaviour warrants strong action.'

Mr McLoughlin said drivers who 'significantly' break the speed limit should face 'the full force of the law'.

Nash is looking for a new club having been freed by Norwich City at the end of last season.
