A man acting as his own attorney at his murder sentencing in Florida is pushing to get himself the death penalty.

Craig Wall, 39, was found guilty last week of killing his 5-week-old son in Clearwater and stabbing his girlfriend Laura Taft, 29, to death less than two weeks later in 2010.

While seeking a death sentence in court on Monday, Wall rejected the efforts  to have an independent attorney appointed for him.

Wall said he didn't want the help of 'scumbag liberals' who think he can't make his own decisions, the Tampa Bay Times reports.

'The presentation of my case and my mitigation is my constitutional right,' Wall said. 'This is my case. This is my life. All the choices are mine alone to make.'

Wall pleaded guilty on February 13 to murdering girlfriend Taft and pleaded no contest to killing the couple's infant son.

After the baby's death, Wall was jailed for violating a domestic violence injunction Taft had filed against him, but neither a recent 14-year stay in prison nor his status as a suspect in his son's death was mentioned in court.

Three days after he was released on $1,000 bail, Taft was stabbed to death in her apartment.

'Yeah I killed her,' Wall said in court. 

Taft's plea agreement was settled only after prosecutors promised to seek the death penalty.

Sentencing resumed on Tuesday where Wall told the judge he would continue to represent himself, saying, 'I've been enjoying myself.'
