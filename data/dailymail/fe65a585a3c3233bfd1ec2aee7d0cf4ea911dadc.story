These CCTV images show the final moments of man who was crushed to death between a train and a platform after a vicious fight broke out with a group of passengers

The horrifying pictures captures the drunken brawl which led to Ryan Harrison's horrific death in March last year and were shown during a trial at Guildford Crown Court.

The jury were told how the 20-year-old was hit with a 'haymaker' punch which knocked him down between the departing train and the platform at Guildford train station.

Judge Christopher Critchlow described it 
as 'a horrific way to die' and said Mr Harrison's death had a shattering
 effect on his family and friends.

Three friends are now starting prison sentences for their part in the vicious brawl which began after after Mr Harrison said one of the passengers looked like Lord of the Rings character Gollum.

Joshua Elphick, who had admitted manslaughter and causing an affray at a hearing earlier this year, was jailed for five years.

Following a week-long trial, two of his friends, Jack Hardy and Harry Miller, both 20, were convicted of affray and each jailed for a year.

The defendants, all aged 20 years and from Guildford, had been drinking at a party in Godalming on March 30 last year before boarding a train home with friends.

As they got off the train they passed Mr Harrison, who was with friend Joel Parish.

Both had been drinking in Guildford and they were getting on the last train home to Woking.

As the groups came across each other at the train doors the fight broke out, at first with comments being made.

The war of words continued between the two groups with the train doors being kept open. Elphick and Miller got back onto the train while Mr Harrison and Mr Parish had their shirts ripped in the brawl.

Elphick then rushed onto the train and started throwing punches at Mr Parish, who was dragged from the carriage, thrown to the floor and beaten.

Mr Harrison was then also pulled from the train and attacked, while the defendeants 'acted like a pack', according to witnesses.

The fight was initially broken up by an off-duty military police officer, Staff Sergeant Justin Wright, who protected Mr Parish from Elphick before another of the group pulled the defendant away.

Prosecutor Oliver Dunkin told Guildford Crown Court: 'What then happens must have happened very quickly.

'Mr Elphick shrugged the friend off. He ran down the platform and he punched Ryan Harrison.

'It was described as something of a haymaker. It may well be that the punch itself rendered him unconscious.

'He fell to the edge of the platform and was dragged beneath the train that was then departing.'

That 'drained all fight' from Elphick as he realised what he had done and said: 'Oh my God, I just killed someone.'

Elphick and Miller, who admitted throwing one punch and a kick, were arrested at the scene and Hardy, who helped pull Mr Harrison off the train, handed himself in the next day.

The judge accepted that the defendants did not start the fight but said that the reaction from Elphick and Miller had been 'over the top' and that the group lost control because they had been drinking.

Judge Critchlow said: 'You could and should have walked away.

'Joshua Elphick, you were the primary cause of the fighting because you twice went back onto the train to be abusive and then to fight.

Scene: The brawl began after Mr Harrison made a joke about another passenger at Guildford station last March

'Once you were off the train you continued to be aggressive.

'Neither Jack Hardy nor Harry Miller were directly responsible for Ryan Harrison's death but if you hadn't participated in the way you did, he wouldn't have been pulled off the train and exposed to that further violence.'

Defending Elphick, Vincent Coughlin QC said he had shown genuine remorse for his actions by admitting his guilt straight away and accepted that he must go to prison.

Mr Coughlin said: 'He must face his adult life weighed down by the knowledge that his violent behaviour has caused the terrible loss of another young man's life.'

Miller and Hardy's defence teams stressed that their involvement in the fight was limited and that neither had started the argument, but Judge Critchlow said their sentence would have to be a deterrent.

The judge said: 'Each of you is from a decent home and that makes it all the more tragic for you that you're here and it makes it more difficult to understand how you could have behaved in such a way."

All three were told they will serve their sentences in young offenders' institutions.

Earlier, a fourth man - Adam Kulikowski, aged 20 years and from Cranleigh, Surrey - was found not guilty of affray in connection with the incident.
