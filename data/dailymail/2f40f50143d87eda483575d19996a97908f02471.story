A Connecticut man fatally shot himself in the head during a game of Russian roulette that was seen by a friend during a video chat.

Armand Cyr, 38, was at another friend's apartment in Vernon, about 13 miles east of Hartford, when he put a .38-caliber revolver to his head and pulled the trigger on the evening of July 13, court records revealed this week show.

Cyr, who had a young daughter, shot himself after being handed the gun by the other friend, John Dybowski, 26, who had put the gun to his own head and pulled the trigger without a bullet discharging, police said.

Dybowski was arrested last week after police said they found guns and drugs in his apartment.

Authorities said the fatal game was seen by an unidentified friend from East Hartford who was having an online video chat with the two men.

Dybowski told police he gave Cyr an unloaded revolver and a single bullet, but said he was in another room when Cyr shot himself, according to the affidavit.

The friend at the other end of the video chat said he saw Dybowski put the revolver to his head and pull the trigger, then told Dybowski and Cyr that what they were doing was "crazy," the affidavit says.

The friend then saw Cyr shoot himself and slump back lifeless on a couch. He initially thought it was a joke.

Police said they found two more guns as well as marijuana, heroin, pills and cocaine residue in Dybowski's apartment, resulting in his arrest.

Authorities said they also found photos on Cyr's cellphone of him and Dybowski with drugs and guns shortly before the incident.

Dybowski is detained on $100,000 bail on charges of reckless endangerment, making a false statement, tampering with evidence and various weapons and drug charges.
