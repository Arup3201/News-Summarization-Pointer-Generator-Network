The first NHS hospital to be run entirely by a private firm has slashed waiting times and drastically improved patient care.

Hinchingbrooke, a struggling trust in Cambridgeshire,  was taken over in February.

But NHS figures show that since the company, Circle, stepped in to save the debt-ridden hospital from closure, it has gone from being among the worst-performing trusts in the region to one of the best.

Hinchingbrooke hospital in Cambridgeshire will be run by Circle for 10 years under a £1billion contract

Its accident and emergency unit is currently ranked first out of 46 NHS trusts in the Midlands and East Anglia region in terms of waiting times.

Before the takeover it was consistently near the bottom and many patients were forced to wait longer than four hours.

It now also ranks fifth in terms of the proportion of patients with suspected cancer having tests within two weeks.

Previously it was one of the area’s worst performers and had missed its target every month since June 2010.

The hospital also claims to have 
reduced paperwork so nurses spend more time with patients – 62 per cent 
of their working day, up from 50 per cent – and has even hired a 
Michelin-starred chef to improve hospital food.

However, Circle’s chief executive Ali Parsa admitted the hospital may not meet its savings target for this year.

Under the arrangement, which was overseen by the Government, Circle must ensure Hinchingbrooke saves £10million by next March, and £230million over the next ten years.

Mr Parsa said although it was ‘broadly’ on course to meet these targets, the immediate priority was improving patient care.

He said he had changed the hospital’s management style, explaining: ‘You let the doctors and nurses and the healthcare professionals – who know the patient best and who know their services best – take charge.’

The hospital – which serves 160,000 patients near Huntingdon – is being closely monitored by the Government. If deemed a success, other failing NHS trusts may follow suit.

But unions say that it is early days – 
and warn that the only way the hospital can save the vast sums of money 
required is by laying off staff.

Ali Parsa said the hospital was on course to balance its books by next year

Karen Jennings, assistant general secretary at Unison, said: ‘The staff at Hinchingbrooke Hospital have worked enormously hard to turn around what not too long ago was a failing hospital, and for this they should be rightly congratulated.

'However, these early clinical successes should not be used by Circle to whitewash persisting financial problems.’

Before the takeover, the hospital had amassed debts of nearly £40million brought about by decades of poor management, failed private finance schemes and lack of funding from the NHS.
