Pennsylvania officials have been left red-faced over misprinted new bridge signs honoring a slain Civil War hero.

The West Crawford Avenue Bridge in Connellsville has been renamed the Officer McCray Robb Bridge in remembrance of the 33-year-old veteran who was shot dead three weeks after joining the police force in May 1882.

However, when the new signage was unveiled Monday, workers were quick to spot that the first and last names had been printed back to front.

Misprint: The West Crawford Avenue Bridge in Connellsville has been renamed the Officer McCray Robb Bridge in remembrance of the 33-year-old veteran who was shot dead in May 1882

The plaques, produced by Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PennDOT), list the bridge's new name as Officer Robb McCray Bridge.

Connellsville police Officer McCray Robb was killed while helping another officer arrest two drunk brothers at a traveling circus. 

The brother who shot him in the chest was accused of murder and was originally sentenced to death.

But he received a second trial in which he was convicted of second degree murder.  

Remembered: More 3,000 Connellsville residents reportedly attended Robb’s funeral with community donations covering all of the costs

More 3,000 Connellsville residents reportedly attended Robb’s funeral with community donations covering all of the costs. 

A ceremony renaming the borough's West Crawford Avenue Bridge in Robb's honor was held Saturday with the signs installed in the designated locations two days later. 

PennDOT spokeswoman Valerie Petersen told the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review the signs were printed based on the bill sponsored by retiring Democratic state Sen. Richard Kasunic.

An aide for incoming Republican state Sen. Pat Stefano says the lawmaker will work to correct the mistake, perhaps by sponsoring an amended bill.
