It has been said that behind every powerful man is a strong woman and a cheeky remark by a senior Liberal Democrat suggests that is the key to the Deputy Prime Minister's working life.

Danny Alexander, the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, joked yesterday that Nick Clegg starts his text messages OMG – or On Miriam’s Guidance.

He made the playful comment that Nick Clegg is steered by his wife of twelve years, Miriam, at an informal lunch for journalists.

A spokesman for Mr Clegg said the remarks were made in jest and the Deputy Prime Minister had found them 'very funny'.

His light-hearted comments follow the revelation that David Cameron signed off his messages 'LOL' to mean 'lots of love' to Rebekah Brooks, the News International boss.

'Rebekah Brooks and I have more than red hair in common,' said Mr Alexander.

'I have also had problems with text messages from a senior member of the government. But mine come from the Deputy Prime Minister rather than the Prime Minister.

'The first few months of our time in office, I thought we were getting really stressed out because every text he sent me started with the letters ‘OMG’.

'But it turns out that this is code in the Clegg household for ‘On Miriam's Guidance’.'

Nick Clegg's wife, 44, is known by her maiden name González Durántez.

She is a senior lawyer for a City firm - she left DLA Piper this year and is now head of European Union trade and government affairs at the law firm Dechert LLP.

During the 2010 general elections Mrs Clegg did appear by her husband's side and publicly said that she would be 'willing to help' with the campaign but, unlike Samantha Cameron, she would be unable to take time off from work and her family life to take part.

She told a Spanish newspaper that there were ‘a number of reasons why I would quit my job...if Nick were Prime Minister and I had to support the country, I would have no problem in doing so’.

The couple married in 2000 and Mr Clegg has admitted he found himself ‘bewitched’ by his future wife Miriam, when they were both studying in Belgium, even learning Spanish to woo her.

Last year she told women's magazine Grazia how she was 'surprised' when people asked her how she coped with three children and a busy working life.

'I always get very surprised when I’m asked this question because, you know, I have three children, I have a busy career and I have a very busy husband,' she said.

'Yet my husband has three children, he has a much busier career than I have, and he has a busy wife.'

She also said Mr Clegg 'kills himself' balancing being a good father and a good leader of the Liberal Democrats.

She does not appear often in public, although she has featured in Vogue style files.

Her husband paled into insignificance last April when they arrived at the Royal Wedding - her outfit was reminiscent of a Spanish flamenco dancer, with a bright orange hat teamed with bright orange lipstick, a dress swathed in black netting, long black leather gloves, black stilettos.

Mrs Clegg, a Roman Catholic, admits that she refused her husband’s plea to give English names to their three sons, Antonio, Alberto and Miguel.

Mr Clegg said: ‘Miriam told me in no uncertain terms that if they had to live with this short, stubby Anglo-Saxon name of Clegg, then they needed something a little more exotic to come before it.’

Mr Alexander also used yesterday's speech for party matters - he said voters should not  'write off' Liberal Democrats.

'I believe as a party we are making an enormous contribution to this government. We will continue to anchor this government firmly in the centre ground,' he said.
