The commercial cargo ship Dragon returned to Earth from the International Space Station on Sunday, bringing back nearly two tons of science experiments and old equipment for NASA.

SpaceX's Dragon splashed into the Pacific, just five hours after leaving the orbiting lab.

'Welcome home, Dragon!' the California-based company said via Twitter.

The Dragon capsule was bringing back 3,500 pounds of gear, with splashdown planned in the Pacific Ocean, about 300 miles offshore from Mexico's Baja California peninsula.

The splashdown successfully ended another contracted cargo delivery flight contracted by NASA to resupply the International Space Station. The Dragon capsule will be taken by boat to a port near Los Angeles, where it will be prepared for a return journey

It's the only supply ship capable of safely returning items. The astronauts released it using the International Space Station's big robot arm

After a one-month visit, the SpaceX cargo ship was set loose Sunday morning. Astronaut Steven Swanson, the station commander, released it using the big robot arm as the craft zoomed more than 260 miles above the South Pacific.

'Very nice to have a vehicle that can take your science, equipment and maybe someday even humans back to Earth,' Swanson told Mission Control.

The SpaceX Dragon is the only supply ship capable of returning items to Earth.

The others burn up on re-entry.

This was the fourth Dragon to bring back space station goods, with 3,500 pounds aboard; it came down off Mexico's Baja California coast.

SpaceX's billionaire CEO, Elon Musk, said it was a 'happy day' for he and his customer: NASA

Supplies: More than two tons of food, spacewalking gear and experiments were delivered to the ISS by the Dragon

NASA is paying SpaceX and Virginia-based 
Orbital Sciences Corp. to make station deliveries. Orbital is next up, 
next month. Russia, Europe and Japan also make occasional shipments.

SpaceX also is competing for the right to ferry station astronauts, perhaps as early as 2017

The Dragon rocketed to the space station on April 18 with a full load and arrived at the orbiting lab two days later.

Following Sunday's splashdown, a ship is to carry the Dragon to a port near Los Angeles, and then it will go to a SpaceX factory in McGregor, Texas.

Critical science samples will be hustled off at the port for quick return to NASA.
