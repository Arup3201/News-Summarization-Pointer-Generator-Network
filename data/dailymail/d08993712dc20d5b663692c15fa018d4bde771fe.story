Marriage itself only lasted for 72 days

Humphries did NOT attend court

Sombre Kim attended as per judge orders

Kris Humphries has decided to settle with Kim Kardashian in their divorce case after battling for a year and a half - and over five times as long as the marriage itself lasted.

According to sources, Kris backed down after no evidence of fraud perpetrated by Kim emerged.

He was then forced to consider mounting legal costs and the prospect of losing any pay-out from his estranged wife - a pre-nup would be invoked if the trial got to court.

This means that Kris has most likely 
agreed to a divorce - as Kim wished - and dropped his pleas for an 
annulment based on fraud, and sources are saying the judge has signed off divorce papers and dissolved the marriage.

Kris, who was ordered by the judge to
 attend Friday's hearing so he could face fines for last no show, skipped the appointment.

But a sombre-looking Kim acquitted herself well by refusing to revel in getting the verdict she wanted, and looked stunning in a beautiful, suitably black fitted dress.

It's been a dirty fight, with each camp going back and forth with tales of betrayal and deceit.

A
 source even claimed that Kris was the one who persuaded his estranged 
wife to take the honeymoon trip to the Amalfi Coast in Italy.

‘Kris was the one to push for the 
honeymoon. Kim didn’t want to go on the honeymoon because they were 
scheduled to move to New York City to begin filming Kourtney & Kim 
Take New York,’ a source told Radar Online.

‘Kim finally relented. Kris was 
absolutely dumbfounded when a photographer appeared out of nowhere and 
started taking pics of them by the pool,’ the source said. ‘Kim happily 
posed, and Kris realised her camp had arranged it.’

Respectful: You could've expected Kim to do a little jig but she behaved with impressive decorum

Stylish: The court date mustered a delightful outfit from Kim

At her divorce deposition Kim 
confessed that she was against going on the holiday, which Kris is 
allegedly using as part of his case against the 32-year-old reality 
star, claiming their marriage was fraud.

On Wednesday Kim, who is pregnant with her first child, was seen looking somber as she arrived at a Los Angeles studio alone.

Her
 boyfriend Kanye West meanwhile has been based in Paris since Fashion 
Week in February, with Kim regularly flying over to visit him.
