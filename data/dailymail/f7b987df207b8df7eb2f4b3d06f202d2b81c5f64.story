The long-suffering husband of infamous 'tanning mom' Patricia Krentcil has been embarrassed yet again by his wife's wild antics.

But Rich Krentcil remained loyal, trying to downplay the mother-of-five's drunken appearance at a New York drag show.

'Maybe she overdid it. But she doesn’t go out much,' he told the New York Post. 'She got a little nervous, but she was just trying to have a good time.

Backing her up: Rich Krentcil remained loyal to his wife, downplaying her wild antics

'It was a little wild, a little crazy. She feels a little bad,' he said at the door of their home in Nutley, New Jersey.

Krentcil refused to talk to the 
press herself, screaming from behind her front door: 'Shut up! Don’t open the 
f***ing door. I’m not going out there. I’m done!'

In a vain attempt to rebuff claims of
drunkenness at the XL club in Manhattan, she shouted from within the
house: 'Look, I’m falling down, and I’m not even drunk.'

The orange-tinted 44-year-old has shut herself away 
following the embarrassing appearance on Wednesday night, 
where she allegedly shouted expletives at the audience, kicked 
over her wine glass, and even tried to 'attack' the drag queen hosting 
the event.

Witnesses at Manhattan's club said
Krentcil was so inebriated she fell over on the red 
carpet after turning up for her headline slot at the 'Tan Mom at Hot 
Mess' event.

The tanning 
addict was thrust into the spotlight earlier this year after being 
accused of taking her then five-year-old daughter to a tanning booth.

The
girl, who has fair skin and red hair, told a school nurse she had 'gone
tanning with mommy' when staff at her school asked her about burns on 
her skin.

Krentcil denied taking her daughter to a tanning booth and said the child was burned by the sun while she played outside.

Jokes
aimed at the mother at the comedy event - which was billed as a 'roast'
of the internet celebrity - evidently failed to amuse, as she began 
shouting at the audience, sending staff scrambling to get her off the 
stage.

'She showed up for the red carpet and fell over,' one witness told the New York Post.

'She then got up and tried to attack the drag queen.'

Krentcil, who is holding a large glass 
of wine in photographs from the event, was said to be incoherent as the 
'mistress' of ceremonies tried to keep her focused.

Aftermath: A member of staff is left to mop up the mess left behind after Patricia Krentcil's curtailed appearance in New York

Bianca del Rio, one of the hosts at 
the club, said: 'We asked her what she wanted to drink and she slurred: 
"I didn't put my kids in a tanning bed!"'

She said staff had planned ahead in case things went awry during Krentcil's appearance.

'We came up with a code word earlier. It was "Christmas",' she said.

'After about five minutes, we were just screaming "Christmas", and security came and took her out.'
