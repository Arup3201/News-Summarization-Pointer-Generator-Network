A 40-year-old father has been charged with child cruelty after failing to take his seriously injured sons straight to hospital after a car crash on Tuesday night.

Vermont's Justin Galenski and his children, aged nine and four, were hurt after their car plowed into a utility pole on Old City Falls Road in Strafford, which was covered with snow. 

Galenski then walked about a mile with the young boys to the home of a registered nurse he knew, hoping she could assess their injuries.

Decision pending: Justin Galenski, 40 (pictured) could be charged with child neglect after failing to take his seriously injured sons (pictured) straight to hospital after a car crash on Tuesday night

He allegedly waited until the next day to
take the boys to hospital, where they received treatment for 
concussions, a broken arm 
and a broken clavicle.

St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported the boys' mother called police the next day, concerned about the delayed medical 
treatment.

Galenski suffered a broken wrist, according to WCAX.

'I love these boys. The sun and moon rises with them with me,' Galenski told St. Louis Post-Dispatch today.  'This was an accident. It was a horrible, horrible night. By no means did I mean to hurt my kids.'

State police said they received a report of a car crashing into a utility pole in Strafford on November 12 but that the vehicle had been removed by the time troopers arrived.

Vermont State Police have also charged the Fairlee man with leaving the scene of an accident and reckless endangerment. He is due in court next month.
