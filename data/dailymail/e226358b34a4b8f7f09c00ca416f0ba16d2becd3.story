An Ohio school teacher who tried to sue her school district for discrimination after claiming she had a phobia of young children has had her case thrown out by court.  

Maria C. Waltherr-Willard, of Greenhills, Ohio, had worked as a high school French and Spanish teacher but alleged the school district reassigned her to teach junior high as a way of expediting her exit.

The 63-year-old said she suffered from pedophobia, a fear of young children, and claimed the Mariemont school district knew of her condition and still assigned her to teach younger aged students.

But she lost her appeal at a three-judge panel of the 6th US Circuit Court of Appeals in Cincinnati.  

The teacher claimed she had suffered from pedophobia since the 1990s and had been told by school district that she would not have to teach young children.

Mariemont sent Willard to a psychiatrist for an independent evaluation, which confirmed that her 'mental state...would disable her from teaching [children under 12].' 

For the next twelve years, Willard remained at the high school, where she taught all levels of French and the introductory course in Spanish.

Eventually, Mariemont decided to move its French courses online, which meant that the high school no longer needed a French teacher.

The school district's superintendent, Paul Imhoff, met with the high-school principal, James Renner, to discuss what to do with Ms Willard. 

Mr Renner told Mr Imhoff about Willard's pedophobia and so he decided to transfer her to middle school. 

Ms Willard did not object to the new assignment, and later expressed 'enthusiasm' for teaching middle school children. 

Willard began teaching at the middle school in September 2010.  

Six months later, she asked Mr Imhoff to send her back to the high school, saying that her talents were 'underutilized' at the middle school and that another year there would have 'further detrimental impact on [her] health.'  

Mr Imhoff responded that '[t]here are currently no openings at Mariemont High School for the next year, but I will keep your request on file.' Shortly thereafter, Ms Willard retired.

The teacher claimed her move to middle school caused her blood pressure to soar - but her case was rejected

Two years later, she brought the lawsuit against the school saying her transfer to the middle school had triggered her phobia.  

She claimed it caused her blood pressure to soar and forced her to retire in the middle of the 2010-11 school year.  

But the federal court upheld the decision of the lower court saying it was correct in ruling in the school district's favor on the various claims, including age and disability discrimination. 

It said Ms Willard had asked to school to employ her at the high school as a full-time Spanish teacher (on account of her disability), but it already had one and so did not need another. 

It also said she was not discriminated against for her age, as her replacement was 'not substantially younger than she was'.

The court also rejected her claim she was treated with 'ridicule and insult' as any emails circulated behind her back did not refer to her age or pedophobia.
