I have 
seen Bernie Ecclestone reduce grown men to giggling sycophancy. It is 
not intimidation that does it – at least not in my experience – but 
charm. He is only 5ft 3in in his socks but he has a charisma that fills a
 room.

Hearing the evidence he gave this week in Munich at the start of a five-month bribery trial that may strip him of his sport, as well as his liberty, I was reminded of this knack. Asked whether he was divorced or married, he replied: ‘Both.’ I can envisage his usual squinting look of befuddlement and hear his dead-pan, sotto voce delivery. ‘I like to remember the divorce bit,’ he added with emphasis.

Humour, usually in the form of a one-liner, has been one of his great weapons through the 60 years and more in which he transformed himself into a billionaire. An eye for a deal is another obvious part of the arsenal.

D-day: Bernie Ecclestone arrives at court as he faces trial in Germany

No laughing matter: Ecclestone is flanked by his lawyers as he arrives at court in Munich

His line in Munich took me back to the High Court in London at the end of last year. There, he was asked about the hypothetical idea of paying millions to buy off a blackmailer who alleged erroneously that he had cheated on his ex-wife, Slavica. Pressed on whether he would really do that, he said: ‘You haven’t met my wife.’

While we’re on the subject of Ecclestone’s wit, here is what he told me in 2012 about his daughter Petra’s £5million wedding: 'I had to do something at the time that upset me. I had to give her away. I’d rather have sold her.’

In the same interview, I asked him when he thought he would hand over Formula One. ‘Past 100, I’m definitely out,’ he said. ‘I don’t know who should do it – honestly there’s nobody I despise enough that I would wish this on them.’

Asked on another occasion when his autobiography would be published, he responded: ‘The morning after I die. And the first 12 copies will go to the Inland Revenue.’

Last month when asked what he thought of the quieter new engine noise, he said he would like the sound to be louder, before adding Frankie Howerd-style: ‘I wish I could get it up.’

Not everyone will find all the jokes to his or her taste. Fine. They are often distinctly un-PC. Certainly, the next two examples will offend many sensibilities but I include them to give a true flavour of the man.

Asked about the merits of having a female driver in Formula One, he opined: ‘What I would really like is to find the right girl, perhaps a black girl with super looks, preferably Jewish or Muslim, who speaks Spanish.’ 

And questioned about Danica Patrick, who made her name racing in America, he said: ‘You know, I’ve got one of these wonderful ideas that women should all be dressed in white like all the other domestic appliances.’

Humour: Ecclestone is well known for his wit and one-liners

In fairness, he could laugh at himself as easily as others. After being mugged, he posed, his face black and blue, for a watch advert under the banner: ‘See what people will do for a Hublot.’ (I’m not counting his remark that he admired Hitler for being ‘able to get things done’ as a quip; he actually meant that one.)

Bernie Ecclestone has said and done many stupid things, he has looked old-fashioned and, to some minds, bigoted, yet his sense of mischief has unmistakably drawn in many people.

In the early days his charm opened doors for him, a second-hand car dealer, to play chemmy with the likes of Cubby Broccoli, Lord Beaverbrook and, at least once, Lord Lucan. It enabled him to do deals nobody else had the chutzpah to attempt. And it means he still has a direct line in to presidents, prime ministers, small-town dictators, titans of industry, the good, the bad and the dangerous.

Paddock power: Ecclestone remains in charge of Formula One despite his advancing years

But, as he learned when Mr Justice Newey published his scathing judgment in the previous High Court hearing, the quips do not make a jot of difference in the legal matters at hand, namely whether he bribed a German banker to sell the sport at a reduced price so he could continue running it.

That is why it is best for him that he will not be giving evidence directly in Munich, but only through his lawyers. For once, it’s not jokes that can save Bernie.

There has been discussion, including on the Daily Mail’s back page, about when precisely Ecclestone’s absolute control over Formula One was irretrievably broken.

Having to stand down from the F1 board to fight charges in Germany was a big moment. So, too, was the verdict of Mr Justice Newey, who, to elaborate on the item above, found in Ecclestone’s favour on a technicality but condemned his evidence as unreliable.

Might I suggest another significant moment, which has yet to materialise? It is when he no longer decides who gets a paddock pass, the entree to the sport’s inner sanctum. It is said that even Donald Mackenzie, chairman of CVC, the sport’s owners, is beholden to Bernie’s patronage on this one.

He who hands out the passes, holds the power.

A thought to ponder as we approach next week’s 20th anniversary commemoration of Ayrton Senna’s death. Many rank the brilliant Brazilian as the finest of all drivers; he is certainly a contender for the accolade.

But I wonder whether, in general, those who survived their careers should not be granted greater recognition than those who perished.

Remembered: Ayrton Senna was killed 20 years ago next week

Memories: Pictures of Senna are seen on a fence at the site where he died at the race track in Imola

After all, in eras past, survival was the ultimate achievement. As well as luck, it took skill to live – to assemble a dependable team around you, to feel impending malfunction before it killed you, to ensure you ran off the track as infrequently as possible.

Discuss.

One piece of vaguely Senna-related trivia. Lewis Hamilton went behind his dad’s car to cry when he heard his idol was dead, so one might think his helmet has been yellow for most of his career in homage to Senna. No so. He was told to wear yellow so his fretful father could spot him among fellow young karters.

Nonetheless, what chance Lewis returning to a full yellow helmet as a mark of respect to Senna at the next race, in Spain? It would be a heartfelt touch.
