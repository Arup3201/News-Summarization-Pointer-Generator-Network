Samuel Shoyeju abused his position as an entry clearance officer for the UK Border Agency

A senior immigration officer is facing a lengthy jail term after he admitted illegally issuing 'scores' of visas to immigrants, granting them indefinite leave to remain in the UK.

Samuel Shoyeju, 53, abused his position as an entry clearance officer for the UK Border Agency by allowing African nationals to avoid the normal application process.

The visas enabled those who received them – mainly Nigerians – to live and work in Britain.

A Crown Prosecution Service source 
said: 'We think most of the people who received the visas will never be 
traced. They've slipped through the net for good.'

A court heard yesterday there was 
evidence Shoyeju had received tens of thousands of pounds in cash 
payments in his bank accounts.

But it is understood it would be 
difficult to prove where the money came from and six charges, including 
money laundering offences, were dropped against the married 
father-of-three, who lives in Canvey Island, Essex.

Shoyeju admitted a charge of wilful 
misconduct by granting indefinite leave to remain to non-EU nationals 
who did not qualify under immigration laws.

The offence, which carries a maximum 
jail term of ten years, related to 'scores' of visas handed out before 
April 30, 2008, Basildon Crown Court heard.

Shoyeju, who worked at the agency's 
headquarters in Croydon, South London, was remanded in custody and is 
not expected to be sentenced until the conclusion of a trial of a 
co-defendant.

Judge Christopher Mitchell said: 'He's facing a substantial period in custody.'

'The UK Border Agency expects the 
highest levels of integrity, behaviour and professionalism from its 
workforce and we take any allegations of abuse very seriously,' a 
spokesman said. 'If someone is believed to have committed a crime, they 
will be prosecuted.'

Prosecutor Lucy Kennedy said there was
documentary evidence of vast sums of money being paid into Shoyeju's 
account. 'There is an inference to be drawn in that Mr Shoyeju did 
receive funds,' she added.

'The fact is we do not know why he was
doing it. For the purposes of sentencing the Crown says the most 
critical point is the vast breach of trust.'

But Stephen Linehan QC, defending, 
said: 'My case has always been that he did not do this for money – there
is absolutely no doubt about it. 'The defendant's case is “I did put 
that money in my account. It was not criminal property”.'

Few details were given about the case during the brief hearing.

The case comes as the UK Border Agency
is already engulfed in separate controversy over claims it went beyond 
the terms of a pilot scheme to relax border checks.

Immigration officers were informed 
secretly to relax checks on biometric chips on the passports of 
thousands of people from outside the European Union, it is claimed.

Staff were also told not to check 
fingerprints and other personal details against a database containing 
the names of terror suspects and immigrants who posed a risk to the 
public.

Home Secretary Theresa May is facing difficult questions over whether she knew of the decisions.
