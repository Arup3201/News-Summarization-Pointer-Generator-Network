Mo Farah has had his nationality called into question by the Spaniard whose European half-marathon record he broke in Lisbon on Sunday.

Fabian Roncero claimed he still considered himself the record holder because Farah set a new 'Somalian record'.

Farah won the EDP Lisbon Half Marathon in 59 minutes 32 seconds to take 20 seconds off the mark set by Roncero 14 years ago.

In an interview with Spanish news agency EFE Roncero said 'what was broken in Lisbon was the Somalian record'.

The double Olympic champion was born in Mogadishu in Somalia before moving to Britain as a child.

Roncero's comments come in the wake of Farah's feud with compatriot Andy Vernon. Farah alleged his team-mate suggested he did not deserve the European 10,000 metres title he won last summer as he was not European, claims Vernon branded 'complete lies'.

Roncero, 44, added: 'For me, an athlete who was born in Kenya is Kenyan for life and one born in Somalia is Somalian forever.'

Farah, who celebrated his 32nd birthday on Monday, has won five global titles in the colours of Great Britain to become arguably the country's greatest ever athlete.

Roncero also said: 'For me the 800m European record holder remains Sebastian Coe, the 1500m (holder) Fermin Cacho, the 5,000m (holder) Dieter Baumann and the 10,000m (holder) Antonio Pinto.'

In fact Farah holds both the 1500m and 10,000m marks, while the 5,000m mark is held by Moroccan-born Belgian Mohammed Mourhit.

Farah's camp declined to comment on Roncero's remarks when contacted.
