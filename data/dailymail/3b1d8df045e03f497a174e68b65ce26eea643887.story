Punished: Andrea Chisholm, 54, was sentenced to one year in prison for aiding and abetting wrongfully obtained public assistance 

A Minnesota woman who once claimed to be Scottish nobility has pleaded guilty to illegally collecting welfare payments while living in a mansion.

Andrea Chisholm, 54, accepted responsibility for aiding and abetting wrongfully obtaining public assistance.

She admitted in court Tuesday she signed welfare applications that were inaccurate and resulted in her collecting more than $60,000, but told the judge they were filled out by her husband, 62-year-old Colin Chisholm III.

Her plea agreement calls for one year and one day in prison, with credit for 142 days already served.

‘It’s appropriate that Andrea Chisholm spend time behind bars for cheating the public of welfare dollars,’ County Attorney Mike Freeman said. ‘Her husband’s case remains open, as it appears he was a bigger player in defrauding the public as we heard in Andrea’s testimony today.’

The presiding judge also ordered the defendant and her husband, who at one time called themselves Lord and Lady Chisholm, to pay restitution, Minnesota Star Tribune reported. 

The self-proclaimed aristocrats allegedly collected more than $167,000 in fraudulent medical and food-stamp claims in Florida and Minnesota while living in a $1.6million lakefront mansion in the Minneapolis suburb of Deephaven.

They also owned a $1.2million yacht in Florida and had millions of dollars in their bank accounts, according to prosecutors.

Dynasty: According to their company website, the couple trace their roots to Clan Chisholm in Struy, Scotland 

There is no word yet if Andrea Chisholm will testify against her husband, who has a pretrial hearing set for September 10.

Prosecutors claimed the Chisholms ran a seven-year scam while owning a six-bedroom palatial home on the shore of Lake Minnetonka, a beach property in Florida, a $30,000 Lexus and $3million in undeclared funds.

The family’s web of lies began unraveling, according to officials, as investigators tightened the net around them, forcing the couple to flee to the Bahamas along with their seven-year-old son and their dog. 

According to the criminal complaint filed in February, the Chisholms applied for more than a dozen forms of medical assistance, welfare payments and food stamps, first in Minnesota and then in Florida.

Lap of luxury: The seemingly destitute couple not only owned a $1.2million yacht but also a $30,000 Lexus

Lady Chisholm had her prenatal care for the couple's son in 2006 paid for by the state while claiming to be destitute.

Colin Chisholm did not declare that he ran a broadcasting business, while Lady Chisholm kept mum about being the owner of a dog kennel which breeds elite Cavalier King Charles Spaniels.

According to the website for their company Strathglass Kennel, the couple trace their roots to the Clan Chisholm from the small village of Struy in the Scottish Highlands.

Mr Chisholm is listed as the president and CEO of TCN Network, a satellite TV company serving the Caribbean.

More than $1million flowed through accounts he controlled as part of that company, a criminal complaint stated.

The couple were living with Lady Chisholm's mother in Minneapolis when they first applied for welfare in 2005.

However, for the next two years, they resided on their Florida yacht, and later at a beach property in the state, none of which was ever declared, investigators claim.

In April 2007, the Chisholms came back to Minnesota and filled out forms for more benefits.

In March 2008, they moved into a luxury home in Deephaven with Andrea’s grandparents Eloise and Francis Heidecker.

Francis died in February 2009 at age 94 and by September of that year, the Chisholms were evicted from the home.

They immediately moved to another Deephaven home on Lake Minnetonka with stunning waterfront views.

The home, built in 1909, has six bedrooms, five bathrooms and stretch to 5,800 sq ft set on 1.6 acres, according to property records.

None of these details were declared on welfare forms - nor the fact Andrea Chisholm had power of attorney and controlled the finances of her elderly grandmother.
