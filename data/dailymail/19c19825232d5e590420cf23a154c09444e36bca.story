A horse left for dead in a muddy field has been crowned a ‘show champion’ - as her new owner was named ‘vet of the year’ for nursing the mare back to health.

Vikki Fowler was so horrified by the condition of ‘Hope’ when she visited land off Plantation Road field in Edgworth, 
Lancashire, she offered to buy the animal.

Last month Hope’s former owner, ‘horse lover’ Philip Davies, 65, was found guilty of 52 counts of animal cruelty for mistreating the 17 horses and was fined almost £86,000.

Vikki Fowler was so horrified by the condition of Hope when she visited land off Plantation Road field in Edgworth, that she bought animal and nursed her back to health. Hope has recently been entered her in a horse show, winning rescued horse class

He was also 
banned from keeping horses for life after RSPCA officers and vets 
discovered the horrifying scenes at his farm.

Some of the emaciated animals were 
covered in rotting flesh and bald patches, while others were suffering 
from liver damage or weeping sores.

For
all of them, home was an overgrazed muddy field, strewn with broken glass, building materials and bits of 
fencing and wiring.

A year on and not all the horses have been re-homed, but they are in RSPCA care whilst the charity seeks homes for them.

Too weak to stand: This horse was found undernourished and in a ditch

And Vikki, 26, from Great Harwood, Lancashire, has been presented with an award by the International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW) charity at the House of Commons for rescuing the three-year-old shire horse.

Hope had been was found collapsed with her legs tangled in barbed wire.

Seventeen horses were forced to live in 'appalling conditions' by Philip Davies

The two-year-old chestnut mare was cut free by onlookers and Vikki, who was the on-call vet, was called.

Vikki said: 'I thought she was dead. Her head was under the water and she was drowning.

'When we lifted her up with the crane I was convinced that she would not be able to stand.

'She was extremely thin and she had no strength. A normal horse, trapped in barbed wire, wouldn’t just give up.'

Hope was lifted onto her feet and within a few minutes she held her own weight.

Vikki advised Davies to put her into stables that day. But this advice was ignored and Hope was found collapsed again later that day.

The RSPCA was called to the scene and neighbours alerted Vikki.

She said: 'I have already shed a lot of tears over this horse.

'Hope needed a lot of love and care and attention.

'She was full of lice, mites and worms, and her feet were shocking.

'I was convinced she was going to have to be put to sleep, but she very slowly started to regain strength every day.

Concerned onlookers helped out as Hope was moved to a paddock and lifted back on to her hooves by crane

At a recent horse show Hope won overall supreme champion in the rescued horse class and is soon to start her riding preparation work

'She was extremely weak and malnourished. With good food and time she has come through.

'She has cost me thousands to nurse her back to health, but if I had left her, she would have died.'

Hope was entered into a horse show recently and won the title of overall supreme champion in the rescued horse class.

She is also expecting to start her riding preparation work in the next few weeks.
