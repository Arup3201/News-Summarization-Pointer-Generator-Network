At least six senior staff at a scandal-hit animal charity signed gagging orders and received pay-offs totalling some £180,000 while their controversial former boss was in charge.

Kim Hamilton quit as chief executive of Blue Cross last month after allegations she was involved in a love triangle revolving around a female assistant who later committed suicide.

In an anonymous email sent to the charity’s board, employees expressed ‘deep concern’ over the situation that led to Miss Hamilton’s resignation from her £120,000-a-year post.

Now whistleblowers have revealed that at least six former senior staff – including three directors – have left the charity after signing what are known as compromise agreements.

These agreements have been criticised because they prevent them from discussing the reasons for their departure, and they lose the money they received if they do speak out.

Last night critics said it was unacceptable for charities to use so-called gagging orders and called on the Blue Cross to spend its money caring for animals.

Tory MP Charlie Elphicke said: ‘The behaviour of the Blue Cross has let down animals and the members of the public who have entrusted them with their hard-earned money.

‘The use of gagging clauses where public money is concerned is wholly unacceptable and wrong.’

Fellow Tory Priti Patel said: ‘Charities should behave in an open and transparent way. The prospect that they are silencing staff will concern their members and those who donate.’

Both MPs are members of the Public Administration Select Committee looking into charity pay.

The Charity Commission said the use of compromise agreements was a matter for charities but ex-employees should not be prevented from raising concerns in the public interest.

In 2012 Miss Hamilton, a 53-year-old former City trader, started a relationship with Melanie Brown, 27, an administrative assistant at the charity’s HQ in Burford, Oxfordshire.

Six months later, bisexual Miss Brown ended the relationship and started seeing the charity’s head of fundraising, Mike Crossley, 52.

He was later sacked from his £80,000-a-year job and was paid £60,000 to sign a gagging clause to stop him discussing the reasons.

A source said at the time: ‘Kim told Mike he was in a relationship with a vulnerable person at work, and that it was inappropriate so he had to go.

‘His departure was a direct result of his relationship with Mel. It was an entirely personal thing. But how could it be inappropriate if Kim had also had a relationship with Mel?’

Last August Miss Brown was found hanged at her flat in Cirencester, Gloucestershire. An inquest will be held this year.

There is no suggestion that her relationship with Miss Hamilton was in any way linked to her suicide.

The situation prompted Blue Cross employees and volunteers to write to the board of directors to warn that the charity had ‘lost its way’.

In their email they said they were writing anonymously because otherwise they feared dismissal due to the ‘culture of mistrust, blame and fear’ at the charity.

They wrote: ‘We feel compelled to write to you out of deep concern for the charity, given the damage that has been done since Kim Hamilton took over as CEO in 2008. It feels as if Kim Hamilton brought the morally corrupt ethics of the banking sector with her when she joined Blue Cross.

‘What is most concerning to us is that the charity has lost its way – rather than putting animal welfare first, resources are wasted on ever increasing salaries and head office refurbishments.’

Blue Cross has an income of £31million a year and runs four animal hospitals and 12 rehoming centres managed by 650 employees.

Zair Berry, chairman of Blue Cross, said that any decision to ask staff to leave under a confidential compromise agreement ‘is not taken lightly and only considered when it is in the best interests of Blue Cross.

‘As a charity, we do everything we can to ensure that Blue Cross funds are focused on helping pets.’
