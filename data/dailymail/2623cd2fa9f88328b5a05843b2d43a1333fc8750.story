A drugs gang found themselves in deep trouble after police discovered their cannabis farm hidden 10ft underneath a field.

Officers from Avon and Somerset Police found 130 blooming plants - worth £130,000 - by using a thermal image camera to identify heat patches under the soil in Shipham, Somerset.

Drug criminals had tapped into the mains supply of a nearby house to maintain the secret cannabis hoard, using trap doors in the earth to drop into the bunker.

The blooming haul, hidden beneath the soil, was worth around £130,000 according to police

The drugs den had lights and running water buried 10ft under the country field when it was discovered by police.

Inspector Roger Tolley, from Avon and Somerset Police, said: 'We were alerted to the potential cannabis factory by the community.

'The underground factory is the latest in a rising number of cannabis factories up and down the country concealed using increasingly elaborate methods.

'In response, police are using a variety of techniques to help detect potential cannabis sites.

'The
public are our eyes and ears, and information regarding suspected 
illegal activity is absolutely vital in helping us combat crime.'

A
45-year-old woman was arrested on suspicion of production of a 
controlled drug following the raid, on Friday and has been bailed until 
April.

Police found this Gothic wall mirror was a door to a secret room that housed a cannabis factory

Drugs squad police discovered this Gothic wall mirror was a door to a secret room which hid a cannabis factory.

Officers were searching a basement for
drugs when they became suspicious of the five foot high mirror hanging on a wall at a house in Blackley, Greater Manchester.

Detectives began fiddling with the 
frame of the mirror in the belief it had a hidden handle before it 
suddenly opened wide to reveal a second cellar chamber housing 100 
plants which would have yielded £6,000 worth of cannabis.

A .22 calibre air rifle was also 
seized by police during the raid at about 9.30am on 26 February 2012. 
Officers recovered another 100 cannabis plants elsewhere in the 
property. Five people were arrested and bailed pending further 
inquiries.

Inspector Ruth Bradley-Holt, from Greater 
Manchester Police said: ‘What we discovered was a very elaborate set-up,
including false panels leading to a hidden room, all to grow cannabis 
plants on a large scale.

‘This was clearly a meticulously 
planned operation by the offenders but we have successfully stopped the 
production and supply of these drugs on to our streets and it is a 
fantastic result for the community.

‘The fact we recovered a firearm shows
this house was a den for criminality and although we cannot be certain 
what the weapon was intended for, it means one less weapon in the hands 
of the criminals and that could potentially have saved someone’s life.

‘I would urge people in our community to continue to support our fight against drugs.

‘If you have any information about 
drug or drug dealers operating in your area, then please tell us - in 
confidence if needed - and we will continue to take positive action and 
dismantle these cannabis farms and take drug dealers off the streets.’
