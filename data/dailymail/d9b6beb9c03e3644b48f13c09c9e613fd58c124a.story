Decision: David Cameron is deciding whether or not to defy Brussels to bring in harsher migrant rules

David Cameron is set to defy European rules by announcing a tough new set of obstacles for immigrants as Britain's Romanian and Bulgarian communities rapidly grow.

People wishing to enter Britain will have to prove they have lived here for a year, up from three months, before they can receive benefits in one of the proposals expected to be unveiled.

It is one of many goals the prime 
minister will put to the EU in an attempt to negotiate a looser 
relationship with Brussels ahead of a 2017 referendum.

Another policy would remove child benefits from the dependent children of migrant workers, sources claim.

The move is a dramatic step that goes against EU laws preventing member states from having one rule for their citizens requesting state hand-outs, and another for immigrants.

If he goes ahead with the proposals, there is little Europe could do to stop him for years.

The prime minister is today considering the move, which would spark yet another court battle with the European Commission over benefit restrictions and potentially tarnish the country's fragile relationship with the EU.

Currently, Britain is in court with Brussels defending its right to subject migrants to 'additional tests' in order to merit state hand-outs.

However, the prime minister is motivated by mounting pressure from his own voters to guarantee strict control over Bulgarian and Romanian immigrants from January 1, when they will be awarded the same freedom of movement as all EU citizens.

A poll for the Mail identified deep public anxiety about the ending of transitionary immigration restrictions on new EU members Romania and Bulgaria in January.

The poll found that 82 per cent did not want citizens of the two countries to gain free access to the UK, 85 per cent said they feared schools and hospitals could not cope and 76 per cent said young Britons could lose out on jobs.

It also found more voters trust Labour on immigration (17 per cent) than the Tories (11 per cent). Some 44 per cent said they trusted no party.

Sources claim he is encouraged by powerful nations such as Germany, Denmark and Spain also vocalising concerns over the influx of eastern European immigrants.

As of next year, the people of Bulgaria and Romania 
will be free to work and claim benefits in Britain.

At home, pressure is mounting as at least 33 backbench Tory MPs have so far signed a petition to stop Bulgarian and Romanian immigration altogether by 2018.

A cabinet minister told The Sunday Times: 'The writing is on the wall for the way the commission is behaving. Other countries have also had enough.'

Next week, a group of Tories will unveil their own ideas on how Britain could renegotiate its relationship with Europe ahead of the election.

Andrea Leadsom, Chris Heaton-Harris and Tim Loughton, from the Fresh Start Project, have identified at least five major changes to EU treaties they say should be at the heart of Britain’s renegotiation.

They include reforms to protect our financial services industry and an end to limits on work hours. Tory Eurosceptics also want reforms to energy policy, the common agricultural policy, defence and immigration.

Ministers are already furious that the European Commission has taken legal action to try to prevent welfare curbs on non-British EU citizens.

Brussels claims making migrants show they are ‘habitual residents’ before they can claim child benefit, child tax credit, jobseeker’s allowance and state pension credit breaks the right to free movement.

Migrants would have to be actively looking for work and have a realistic prospect of getting a job to claim unemployment benefits.
