Frank Lampard's winner for Manchester City saw the midfielder equal Thierry Henry's all-time Barclays Premier League total of 175 goals.

Lampard has scored for West Ham, Chelsea and City during his 19-year career, and is now just three goals  from Wayne Rooney's total of 178.

The 36-year-old has been instrumental since arriving at the Etihad on loan from New York City, and it's no wonder manager Manuel Pellegrini is keen to keep Lampard in Manchester.

187 - Andrew Cole (Newcastle, Manchester United, Blackburn, Fulham, Manchester City, Portsmouth)

178 - Wayne Rooney (Everton, Manchester United)

175 - Frank Lampard (West Ham, Chelsea, Manchester City) 

175 - Thierry Henry (Arsenal)

162 - Robbie Fowler (Liverpool, Leeds, Manchester City)

150 - Michael Owen (Liverpool, Newcastle, Manchester United, Stoke) 

Any hope of the former England international going beyond Henry's total on Saturday was taken away when he was substituted for James Milner after 60 minutes.

A handshake was exchanged between Pellegrini and Lampard, who had done his job in the first half by giving a City side without Sergio Aguero or Edin Dzeko the lead. 

'175 @premierleague goals for Frank Lampard who has now equalled Thierry Henry's goalscoring exploits. Not bad for a midfielder!' posted City's official Twitter.

Rooney is likely to get his chance to pull away from Lampard on Sunday when United face Liverpool at Old Trafford.

Lampard may not have time to catch up to Andrew Cole, however, if he leaves the Etihad.

Cole got 187 goals during his playing days for Newcastle,  Blackburn, Fulham, Portsmouth and both Manchester clubs. Alan Shearer tops the lot, netting 260 for Blackburn and Newcastle.
