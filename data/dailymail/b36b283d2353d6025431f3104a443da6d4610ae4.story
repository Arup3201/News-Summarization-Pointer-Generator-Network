Read our brilliant preview to the new NBA season... so, who will come out on top? 

The NBA should consider playing more regular season games out of America, according to New York Knicks star Amar’e Stoudemire.

This season there will be two matches played on foreign soil with the Houston Rockets facing the Minnesota Timberwolves in Mexico City on November 12 before the Milwaukee Bucks host the Knicks on January 15 at London’s O2 Arena.

It will be the second time that Stoudemire has played an NBA match in London after being part of a New York side that defeated the Detroit Pistons 102-87 in January 2013.

Stoudemire, who scored 17 points in that victory nearly two years ago, is excited about returning to England but admits a regular recurrence of a trip across the Atlantic with the Knicks depends on commissioner Adam Silver’s decision.

‘I wish we could play in London every single season but again it’s up to the commissioner to come up with that but I do truly enjoy playing in London for sure,’ he said at a teleconference ahead of Friday’s release of tickets for January’s clash.

‘We’re coming to [London] to win I can tell you that much. We’re showing up to win, we’re going to have fun as well and we’re going to enjoy the city of London.

‘We’re going to enjoy the town, the fans and the people there. We’re going to experience the entire experience. The main objective is to win and give the London fans a taste of New York.’

Stoudemire scored 17 points when New York beat the Detroit Pistons 102-87  in January 2013 at the O2 Arena

The two regular season matches follows the NBA Global Games pre-season games in October that featured the Brooklyn Nets, Cleveland Cavaliers, Miami Heat, Sacramento Kings, and San Antonio Spurs playing a series of games in Brazil, China, Germany, and Turkey.

As part of the NBA's effort to connect with its fans globally, its Global Games 2014-15 now includes a total of nine NBA teams playing seven regular-season and pre-season games in seven cities in six countries. On Tuesday it was announced that a record 101 international players from 37 countries will be competing in the league this season too - including Britain's Luol Deng at the Heat.

With this devotion to expanding the game, there have been suggestions that the sport could follow the example of NFL and look at the possibilities of having a franchise outside of America – something Stoudemire believes isn’t impossible.

‘I’m sure the commissioners would take a look at that and see how the fans appreciate the game of basketball there and if it continues to grow then I’m sure that the commissioner will would keep a close eye on that. Hopefully if it continues to grow then we’ll see what happens,’ he added.

Stoudemire has played in the Knicks’ opening two games against the Chicago Bulls and Cleveland after two seasons blighted by knee injury problems. In his absence last year, the Madison Square Garden outfit finished outside the play-offs to the Atlanta Hawks in the Eastern Conference.

Back fit the 31-year-old hopes for a better outcome for himself and his team this campaign despite a tough looking fixture list to begin with as they host the Charlotte Hornets and the Washington Wizards next.

‘My personal goal is to get back to the Amar’e Stoudemire that the world fell in love with. The basketball player that I was able to become as a youth and to continue to improve as a player – I want to get back to my dominant self,’ he said.

‘There are a lot of individual goals of mine but as a team we are looking to succeed as well. With the combination of both of those attributes I think we should be a pretty successful team.

‘We can’t dwell on the past. We don’t forget it but we do keep it in the back of our mind knowing that we don’t want to repeat that so that fuels us to continue to train harder.

‘We’ve definitely got to try and get a few wins out of that [opening] schedule right there. It’s a tough stretch – all four of those teams are playing well but for us I think we’re still trying to get our identity figured out in terms of offence but I think if we continue to work the way we are then we’ll be OK.’
