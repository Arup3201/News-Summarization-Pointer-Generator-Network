Russell Bishop, cleared of the famous 'Babes in the Wood' murders, could now be freed from a life sentence he was later given for the rape and attempted murder of another young girl

The child sex attacker who was the prime suspect in the notorious 'Babes in the Wood' murders in 1986 could soon walk free from jail.

Tragic Nicola Fellows, 10, and Karen Hadaway, nine, went missing 28 years ago today and their bodies were later found in a park in Brighton, East Sussex.

Russell Bishop, then 19, was found not guilty of the killings a year later but was jailed for life for the attempted murder and rape of another young girl in 1991.

Now Justice Secretary  Chris Grayling has approved his case for review in a decision which could see Bishop walk free from prison.

Nicola and Karen, who were neighbours on an estate in Brighton, were last seen alive on October 9, 1986, after going out to play.

Relatives and friends, including Bishop, also from Brighton, joined more than 150 police officers in a hunt for the girls.

They were found strangled in the city's Wild Park the next day, huddled together with Karen's head resting on her friend's lap.

Police believed they knew their killer and arrested Bishop - then a teenager who lodged at Nicola's house for a short time - three weeks later.

He was charged with double murder but was cleared at a trial at Lewes Crown Court in December 1987.

Bishop was later sentenced to life imprisonment after being convicted of the abduction, molestation and attempted murder of a seven-year-old girl.

He is serving a life sentence for those crimes and is one of the longest-serving prisoners in the country not convicted of murder.

The latest decision by the Justice Secretary will see a ruling on whether he should be released from the prison within six months.

The girls' disappearance sparked a huge search, involving more than 150 police officers and scores of locals

A statement from the parole board said: 'We can confirm that it has received a referral of Russell Bishop's case from the Secretary of State for Justice and that his case is currently under review.'

Bishop has always denied the murders, but his potential freedom comes as a blow to the girls' families, who remember them at the scene of their death each year.

Nicola's uncle, Nigel Heffron, 60, recently spoke of his 'frustration' at the lack of answers over the crime.

Mr Heffron said: 'Each year we hold a vigil in the park by the memorial and go there to remember them.

'It is a cold case. We haven't had any updates from the police. Each year goes into the other and we still look for answers.'

Mr Heffron's brother, Ian, has  said of Bishop's potential freedom: 'This is something that stops Nicky and Karen's families from being able to get on with their lives, even after this long.

'Every two years we have to go through this. We need him to be locked up for life and to get justice for Nicky and Karen to ever get any closure.'

The girls' families say they are frustrated the case has still not been solved 28 years later

October 1986 - Nicola and Karen were snatched off the street close to their homes in the Moulsecoomb estate in Brighton after going out to play. Their bodies were found the following day, huddled together in a nearby park. Bishop, who knew both girls, was arrested three weeks later.

December 1987 - A jury took a little over two hours to find the roof tiler  Bishop, then 19, not guilty of the murders.

1991 - Bishop was jailed for life for the kidnap, sexual assault and attempted murder of a seven-year-old girl from Brighton two miles from where Nicola and Karen were found.

2005 - A repeal of double jeopardy laws meant Bishop could have faced a fresh trial if substantial evidence came to light, but the following year, the High Court ruled there was not enough evidence.

2014 - Justice Secretary Chris Grayling approves his case for parole for review. A decision is expected in the next six months.

Police in Sussex say the 'important' case is regularly reviewed and they hope forensic technology may help
