Debbie and Mike VanNoy say that their dog has brought home all kinds of creatures in the past, but they were stunned when he returned to their Missouri home this week with the head of an alligator.

The VanNoys, who live in Kansas City, 
were in such disbelief about what was in their dog Shelby's mouth that 
they thought there was no way it could be real.

Mr VanNoy told WDAF-TV: 'We'd seen every
 kind of animal you can think of. I never thought I'd see an alligator. I
 just couldn't believe it and I go that had to be plastic or something.'

Mystery: The VanNoys have no idea how this alligator found its way into their backyard

Shocking find: Debbie and Mike VanNoy could not believe their eyes when they saw what their dog Shelby had brought in

Man's best friend: The VanNoys say Shelby has brought home all kinds of creatures before, but nothing like this

But there it was - sharp teeth and all.

After examining the head, Mr VanNoy figured that the rest of the gator couldn't be far.

Mrs VanNoy told the station: 'We kept thinking that gator had to be up here somewhere so that’s when he decided to start hunting for it.'

And it was on that hunt when Mr VanNoy found the body - and they estimate that it was anywhere between four and five feet long.

Body: The festering remains of the alligator were found near the backyard playground where the VanNoys' grandchildren play

The discovery was also alarming to the 
couple, as the carcass was found close to the backyard 
playground where their children often play.

Mr VanNoy told WDAF: 'I’m sure it’s an isolated thing, but that’s still gonna be in the back of my head.'

Mike and Debbie VanNoy are now trying to unravel their backyard mystery - where the gator came from and how it got into their backyard.

They have been told that the creature is likely someone's pet that either escaped or was set free.

Looking for answers: The couple was told that the gator was most likely someone's pet that had either escaped or was set free

The couple sent the head to an animal research facility in Colorado for answers on how long the animal had been there.

They were looking to get rid of the rest of the gator's body as soon as possible, as they didn't want it to attract any other animals.

The VanNoys got no help from their local Animal Control, who told the couple that they wouldn’t be investigating the discovery because it was found in an area not known to be inhabited by gators.
