A migrant worker in China kidnapped and repeatedly raped teenage woman over 11 days in a cellar he dug under his rented home.

Chen Xiaolong, 36, faces kidnap and multiple rape charges after holding the 18-year-old captive in the cramped basement beneath his single-room house in Jiaxing, Zhejiang Province. 

Chen confessed to imprisoning the woman and threatening to kill her.

She managed to escape after cutting her ties with a nail file, according to local reports.

Chen Xiaolong, 36, dug the makeshift dungeon (entrance pictured) under his home in China before kidnapping and repeatedly raping an 18-year-old woman

The woman was held captive in the tiny cellar for 11 days and was chained and raped before escaping

The prison (pictured, view looking up from cellar) was accessed through an entrance the size of floor tile

Chen spent six months digging the tiny cellar to house a kidnapped woman

During 11 days of captivity, the woman was raped repeatedly, kept nude all the time and only allowed to leave 
the cellar twice, in order to take a bath in the room above.

She managed to work at gradually cutting her chains using a secreted nail file and was finally able to break free and escape.

Chinese media reported the woman waited for Chen to leave before running for help.

One neighbour told the Qianjiang Evening News. '[She was crying] "if you do not help me, this man will kill me tonight."'

He was arrested that night by police after returning to his home in the migrant village.

The woman was taken after meeting Chen at a karaoke bar on June 12.  

Chen lived in a squalid one-bedroom home where he dug the underground prison (entrance centre)

Pictures of women adorned the walls of Chen's house and were even put up in the cellar among various ropes

He persuaded her to get onto his electric tricycle but then drove her to a secluded area where he threatened her with a knife and electric baton.

Chen then stripped and chained the woman up in the tiny 9ft by 3ft cellar.

The underground prison was just 5ft high and accessed through a tiny entrance the size of a floor tile.

Chen began secretly digging the cellar after renting the house in 2012.

He had plastered the walls and lined the entrance with plastic sheets and newspaper.

When
 police arrived after the woman had raised the alarm they found stashes 
of porn and images of women on his front door and walls.

The woman was only allowed to leave the cellar twice and was forced to use this red bucket as a toilet

Male enhancement pills were among the disturbing items found in Chen's house

Chen lived in filthy conditions with drawings on the wall and dirty floors and furniture

Male enhancement drugs were also found.

Chen also threatened to post naked pictures of the woman online.

Police said Chen told them that violent plots in online novels and pornography influenced his actions.

'He said he got the idea from reading pornography on the internet,' said a police spokesman.

'Once the girl's chains were broken she could get out of the basement and made so much noise screaming that Chen's neighbours came to see what was happening,' he added.
