A farmer who lost his left leg, part of his right leg and suffered horrific  injuries to his arm in a potato harvester accident last year is determined to  be back at work by the autumn.

Father-of-three Darren Taylor, who has a farm just outside York, suffered the devastating injuries after slipping  between the machine's rollers as he checked it in October.

He fought for his life for 30 minutes as the heavy duty machine threatened to  drag in his entire body.

Despite his injuries, the 44-year-old has amazed doctors with his  determination to get back to the job he loves.

Mr Taylor said: 'I have had one prosthetic leg fitted and I am hoping to to be  walking by early summer and want to be back at work by the autumn.'

Stoic: Farmer Darren Taylor and his wife Nicky. He miraculously escaped with his life but lost his left leg and part of his right leg after he was dragged into a potato harvester in a horrific accident

Speaking earlier this year, Darren described how he was 'literally doing the  splits', as his arm and leg were swallowed by the machine with his other limbs  still on the outside.

As he tried to move his right leg to relieve some of the pressure it also  dropped in, this time up to the ankle.

Mr Taylor said: 'It had just got my ankle and by now my left leg was in up to my  thigh.

'At this point I was waiting for it to chew my foot off and I could have just  have got the right leg out.

Mr Taylor said: 'I looked down through the harvester and I thought an oil pipe had burst but when I got my bearings I could see it was my blood'

'I thought there was a chance it could take me right through but I just tried  to hang on as best as I could.

'I looked down through the harvester and I thought an oil pipe had burst but  when I got my bearings I could see it was my blood.

'If the pain scale was one to ten then this was 20, it was horrible. I was just determined it wasn't going to get me.

'I knew I was badly injured  but I was fighting to struggle my way out of it.

'I had to stay awake to keep out of the machine. I was shouting "you're not  going to pull me through".'

Mr Taylor was trapped for half an hour before the  alarm was raised. It took another two hours to free him when specialist engineers had to be  called in to dismantle the machine.

He was flown to Leeds General Infirmary by air ambulance where he spent eight  days in an induced coma and a further three months being treated.

His left leg was fully amputated, his left elbow removed and the bottom of his  right leg amputated.

Mr Taylor said: 'I wish it hadn't happened but the people around  me and the people in Leeds General Infirmary have been that good the least  thing I can do is be strong and appreciate what they have done for me.

'I'm still alive and there were moments when the situation might have been  different.

'I'm so grateful to the emergency services and all the medical staff.'

He has been supported through is ordeal by his wife 47-year-old wife Nicky, who  helps out on the farm, and his children Olly, nine, Tia, 21 and Danielle, 27.

Darren's story has featured on BBC One's Helicopter Heroes and will be on Countryfile on  Sunday.
