Kevin Wright, who used money from charity cancer appeals for himself, pictured at court today

A man who stole nearly £1 million from children's cancer charities, including one he set up to help his own son, has been jailed for five years.

Kevin Wright was sentenced today at Nottingham Crown Court. He had been convicted of ten counts of theft and two of fraud by false representation.

Jurors heard significant sums of money were donated to the appeals Wright set up, but that little of the cash went towards treatment.

Instead the 50-year-old spent the majority of the money on the charities' running costs and funding his own 'interests, investments and personal lifestyle'.

Sentencing, Judge Gregory Dickinson said: 'I believe you have a genuine desire to help families in the same position - however that does not fully explain your actions.'

'You abused the generosity of the public. Your actions risked damaging the confidence in the system of charitable giving.'The court heard that Wright set up a string of appeals following the success of charities established to help his own son, Bobby.

Wright set up Bobby’s Fund and The Bobby Wright Cancer Fighting Fund after his son, then aged three, was diagnosed with neuroblastoma, a type of cancer, in April 2005.

The money was to treat Bobby at a specialist centre in the U.S., but it was later decided that he no longer needed treatment and Bobby, now 11, later recovered.

It
was then Wright turned his attention to fundraising for other children -
enterprises which Judge Dickinson said were 'fradulent from the 
outset'.

He established appeals for Callum Kaye, Armani Mohammad and Jessica Magnus, saying donations would be used to bring the youngsters to the specialist Sloane-Kettering Memorial Cancer Center in New York.

But none of the money was ever used to treat the children, and Wright instead used the money to fund his own lifestyle.

Judge Dickinson said: 'These appeals were a fraud on the public. They were fraudulent from the outset,' adding that they were used 'in part to maintain your lifestyle and image'.

The court heard that Wright, formerly of Kenn, near Exeter, Devon, stole a total of £171,500 from the Bobby Wright Cancer Fighting Fund, including donations of £60,000 made by charities Caudwell Children and Janet Nash.

He also took more than £749,340.79 from the three appeals he set up to raise money for Callum, Armani and Jessica.

The judge said: 'I accept that you did help other children.

'But you were being generous with other people’s money given for a different cause.'

The court heard that it was 'impossible' to say how much money exactly went into Wright’s bank account as he kept no accounts.

However, he used £30,000 of money donated to the Bobby Wright Cancer Fighting Fund to buy the Toad In The Hole restaurant in Exeter and invested £20,000 in a used car business.

Another £60,000 from the fund was put into Premium Bonds by Wright.

In mitigation, Nicolas Gerasimidis, said: 'He is not the typical fraudster. This is not a case where he has enriched himself or lived a lavish lifestyle.

Wright was sentenced to five years in prison today at Nottingham Crown Court (pictured). He had been convicted of ten counts of theft and two of fraud by false representation

'His primary motivation was his desire to help other kids. Clearly temptation got in the way because of the sheer amounts of money involved.'

But judge Mr Dickenson said: 'I do not for one second see him as some sort of latter-day Robin Hood.

'There was, in my opinion, a very considerable element here of personal benefit and self-promotion as well as benefit to other children.

'I will not accept any suggestion that all he was doing was trying to help other children'.

The judge said there was 'something more selfish and arrogant' than that.
