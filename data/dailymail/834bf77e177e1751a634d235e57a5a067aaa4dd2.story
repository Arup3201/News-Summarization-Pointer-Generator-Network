This is the heart-warming moment a young homeless boy threw his arms around the Pope after Francis made a surprise visit to a centre for slum children in the Philippines today. 

The Pope was seen warmly embracing the child on a visit to the Anak-Tnk Foundation - a Jesuit charity in the poverty-stricken Intramuros district of Manila which caters for 300 youngsters.

The pontiff had earlier delivered a speech urging the nation's leaders to end the corruption which contributes to tens of millions of Catholics living in poverty in the country.

Warm embrace: The Pope was seen hugging a homeless boy on the second day of his tour of the Philippines 

He arrived in the Philippines yesterday and was given an electrifying welcome - enhancing the nation's reputation as the Catholic Church's vibrant Asian bastion.

In his first speech of a five-day tour, the Pope took immediate aim at the nation's elite who have for decades enjoyed the spoils of power while the vast majority lived in poverty.

'It is now, more than ever, necessary that political leaders be outstanding for honesty, integrity and commitment to the common good,' the pope said in the speech at the presidential palace.

He challenged 'everyone, at all levels of society, to reject every form of corruption, which diverts resources from the poor'.

The 78-year-old pontiff, seen by many around the world as a bold reformer compared with his predecessor, said the 'great biblical tradition' obliged everyone to hear the voice of the poor.

'It bids us break the bonds of injustice and oppression which give rise to glaring, and indeed scandalous, social inequalities,' he said. 

About 25 million Filipinos, or one quarter of the population, live on the equivalent of 60 cents a day or less, according to the latest official poverty surveys.

The poverty has forced more than ten million Filipinos to head overseas in search of a better life.

Francis said one of the main purposes of his trip was to visit survivors of Super Typhoon Haiyan, known in the Philippines as Yolanda, which left 7,350 people dead or missing in 2013.

He will spend tomorrow in areas of the central Philippines that were devastated by the typhoon, which smashed into coastal communities with the strongest winds ever recorded on land.

'In a particular way, this visit is meant to express my closeness to our brothers and sisters who endured the suffering, loss and devastation caused by Typhoon Yolanda,' the Pope said.

While in Tacloban, the pope is expected to get some first-hand experience of the tropical storms and typhoons that claim hundreds of lives each year in the Philippines.

A tropical storm in the area will bring 'heavy to intense' rain tomorrow, according to the Philippine weather agency.

Monsignor Pedro Quitorio, spokesman for the Catholic Bishops Conference of the Philippines, told AFP the pope intended to press on with the Tacloban trip regardless of the weather.

The Philippines has long been the Church's stronghold in the region, with Catholics accounting for 80 percent of the former Spanish colony's population.

Francis enjoyed a hero's welcome when he arrived on Thursday night, with hundreds of thousands of people crowding the streets of Manila to get a first glimpse of him as he travelled in a motorcade.

Massive crowds continued to choke his motorcade route today as he travelled around the city, including near the centuries-old Manila Cathedral where he celebrated mass with priests and nuns.

'My sacrifice was worth it. I feel happy. I feel blessed,' Nanette Hermano, 56, said as she cried after taking a smartphone picture of the Pope outside the cathedral.

'I've been here since 3:00 am, but I don't feel tired, I don't feel hungry. It's like a miracle.'

During his first speech, Francis also issued his strongest defense yet of church teaching opposing artificial contraception.

His comments were clearly a nod to the local church, which recently lost a significant fight when President Benigno Aquino III pushed through a reproductive health law that allows the government to provide artificial birth control to the poor.

'Be sanctuaries of respect for life, proclaiming the sacredness of every human life from conception to natural death,' Francis exhorted the crowd. 'What a gift this would be to society if every Christian family lived fully its noble vocation. 

Later today Francis will lead thousands of people in prayer at Manila's top concert arena, where music fans have flocked in recent years to see the likes of Bruno Mars, Lady Gaga and Taylor Swift.

The Pope-mania is expected to reach a peak on Sunday, with organisers predicting as many as six million people will turn up to mass at a Manila park.

If as big as expected, the crowd will surpass the previous record for a papal gathering of five million during a mass by John Paul II at the same venue in 1995.

Francis is on a week-long tour of Asia that began in Sri Lanka.

It is his second trip to the region in five months, signalling the importance the Vatican places on Asia's growth potential for the Church.

Speaking on board the plane as he travelled to the Philippines, the pontiff made an impromptu speech, saying you 'cannot insult the faith of others'. 

He added that he would punch someone if they offended his mother, as he debated freedom of speech in the wake of the Charlie Hebdo attack.

The Pope said there were limits to freedom of expression and that 'provocateurs' should not purposely anger religious people.
