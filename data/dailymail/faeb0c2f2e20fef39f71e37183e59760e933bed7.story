PR guru Max Clifford, 70,  arrives at Southwark Crown Court this morning, where he is accused of 11 counts of indecent assault against seven women and girls

PR guru Max Clifford showed a teenage model his penis, saying 'isn’t it tiny?' - before joking about the size of his manhood in a phone call, a court heard today.

Clifford exposed himself twice in his office in London in 1979 or 1980 after the woman went there for interviews about a film role, she told his indecent assault trial.

Giving witness evidence at Southwark Crown Court, she said that at the first interview he exposed himself and held his penis in his hand.

He then criticising its size, describing it as 'useless' and asking 'How can I satisfy a woman with this?', she said.

In a bizarre twist to the case, Clifford's lawyers insisted the woman must be lying and cannot have seen his penis - which they claimed is actually 'average-sized'.

He twice promised an Italian director would call her, but, she told the court, when a man with an Italian accent called her he also talked about the size of Clifford’s penis and invited her to join in with the abuse.

She declined to do so, she said.

During a second call she twigged that the Italian accent was false and realised it was Clifford himself and there was no film, she told the court, so she hung up.

She said the experience had been 'strange', but she did not walk out when he exposed himself because in those days she 'didn’t stand up for myself'.

She added: 'Also...back in those times, as a woman, you kind of accepted that sort of behaviour a bit more than you should have.'

The former model is not one of the complainants in the case.

Defence barrister Richard Horwell QC told the woman, who cannot be identified for legal reasons, that because she described Clifford’s penis as 'tiny', she could not have seen it.

He said: 'His is an average-sized penis. That shows you cannot have seen it.'

She replied: 'I did notice that it was small.'

The woman insisted Clifford exposed himself after looking at her modelling portfolio when they were alone in his office.

She told the court: 'He got his penis out. He just undid his flies and took it out and held it and talked about it.

'He said "Isn't it tiny and useless? How can I satisfy a woman with this?"

'I was embarrassed, I didn't do anything.'

The court heard today that Clifford exposed himself to a woman in 1979 and 1980 and made jokes about his penis

She said she refused to join in with the criticism, adding: 'Knowing me, I would probably have been nice to him, saying something like "It's not that bad".'

She continued: 'He was normal, like he was talking about anything really, like it was normal that someone would take their penis out and talk about how small it was.'

She told the jury Clifford promised that his friend, an Italian film-maker, would call her about a movie role.

She told the court: 'I replied "Yes, he did" and then he began to insult Max Clifford's penis.

'I felt I was meant to insult Max Clifford's willy.'

She said she did not join in but the man on the phone invited her to meet him and Clifford at the defendant's office for a second interview.

She told the court that, when she arrived, only Clifford was there and told her the Italian could not make it.

She said, she said, Clifford again exposed himself and insulted his manhood.

Despite telling her partner and later some close friends what allegedly happened, she did not go to police until the day Clifford was arrested in December 2012, which she saw on television.

She said she had been 'angry' when she saw him on television earlier that year discussing Jimmy Savile and saying that no-one asked for girls' birth certificates in the 1970s.

She said: 'I thought he looked nervous and, when he said girls were just throwing themselves at pop stars...I thought he was trying to pass the blame on to girls.'

Mr Horwell questioned whether the woman had even been to Clifford's office, because she could not recall where in London it was, or what floor of the building it was on.

If the events she described had happened, he asked her, why did she not just walk out?

She replied: 'I didn't stand up for myself. I was a very silly girl. I should have left but I didn't.'

Clifford, from Hersham in Surrey, is accused of 11 counts of indecent assault against seven women and girls. He denies all the charges.

The trial was adjourned until Monday.
