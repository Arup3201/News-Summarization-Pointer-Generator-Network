Fox chief Kevin Reilly today defended ailing American Idol - as it can be revealed the network spent a staggering $40 million on their judging panel only to see ratings flop.

The network paid $18 million to Mariah Carey, $12 million to her rival Nikki Minaj, $6 million to country crooner Keith Urban and $4 million to long-running judge Randy Jackson.

Randy quit the show last week and none of the remaining trio are set to return next year.

And speaking ahead of the TV upfronts - the annual advertisers event - in New York today, the Fox entertainment chairman said the show would 'likely' go back to having three judges, saying 'everything is on the table.'

'Life-changing': Randy, pictured in LA in 2012, said he was 'very proud' of having been a part of the show

Mr Reilly said: 'It's confirmed that one judge is not coming back.'

Insiders say it's highly unlikely Mariah, Nicki and Keith will return - leaving Fox to find a new panel, even though Mr Reilly insisting they would be welcome back.

Mr Reilly also said the show would likely go back to three 
judges, the number it had when the show began with Simon Cowell, Paula Abdul and Randy Jackson.

He said: 'The format, more than anything will have a few fresh twists, a nice little jolt for next season.'

Meanwhile, Cowell is in New York to introduce the third season of the X Factor USA to advertisers.

Mr Reilly said the network doesn't have "any new judges to talk about" on "X Factor" yet, but will make announcements soon.

As MailOnline revealed, former Destiny's Child star Kelly Rowland is set to join Cowell - despite being axed from the UK series.

Pop star Demi Lovato has already signed up for the new season and will join Cowell this afternoon at the upfronts in Manhattan.

And it has been reported by Radar Online that Cowell is now in talks with sizzling Mexican singer Paulina Rubio to be his third female judge.

Kelly and Paulina will replace Britney Spears and LA Reid.

Mr Reilly said he is dealing with changing viewing habits and lower ratings following a 2012-13 season in which American Idol ratings slipped and Fox 
lost first place in the key 18-49 demographic to CBS.

The ratings are down 22 percent compared to last year and Idol even suffered the humiliation of being beaten in the ratings by a rerun of CBS' The Big Bang Theory.

As it heads to its finale this week, Idol was beaten by CBS on Thursday night, which snagged the win with a 2.7 rating in the adults 18-49 category and 12.094 million viewers. FOX came in second with a 2.4 rating and 8.641 million viewers for the Idol ratings show.

Randy Jackson confirmed his departure to E! News on Thursday, stating:'Yo! Yo! Yo! To put all of the speculation to the rest, after 12 years of judging on American Idol I have decided it is time to leave after this season,' he said.

'I am very proud of how we forever changed television and the music industry,' said Jackson. 'It's been a life changing opportunity but I am looking forward to focusing on my company Dream Merchant 21 and other business ventures.'

Idol has seen a steady rotation of judges in recent years, but Jackson is the only original judge to have stayed the course with the series.

'There's always been chaos with American Idol, but this year it's been more than ever,' a source told E!.

When Minaj was asked by Ryan Seacrest on Thursday whether the rumours were true, the rapper answered somewhat cryptically.

'That's a million-dollar question… I have to say this all the time, but
I want people to know it's genuinely from my heart. I love the people on Idol.
I genuinely do,' she told the radio presenter and Idol presenter.

'If I had to do this all over again, I would have done Idol.
Because it's fun, it's laughs. It's kind of sad that what people read all the
time is only when something is negative. But they don't realise that we built a
family, she added.

She then expressed her gratitude to the producers for putting her on the show.

'I feel happy here and I have to thank them for giving me this chance. They
could have picked anyone in the world. And they picked me. So that's all I'll
say about that,' she said.

She doesn't know: When asked whether she and her fellow judges would be fired, Nicki Minaj said, 'That's a million-dollar question', pictured on Wednesday on the show

Despite recent reports, Fox also isn't thinking of bringing former judge Jennifer Lopez back onboard to save the flailing show.

Longtime producer Nigel Lythgoe, who has been with the show from the beginning, is also expected to be replaced.

The 10-year-old Fox show has seen its popularity wane in recent years.

The Fox singing show peaked in 2006's season five when Taylor Hicks was named American Idol and the season finale drew a whopping 36.4 million viewers.

Other contestants that season included Katharine McPhee, Kellie Pickler and Chris Daughtry. It remains the most productive season in terms of generating recording artists.

American Idol recently has been struggling against other competition shows and this season may  relinquish its crown as the most popular show of its genre.

Two same-week editions of NBC's The Voice and ABC's Dancing With The Stars last month drew larger audiences than Idol.

The show enjoyed its most success with its original panel of three judges that included the acerbic Simon Cowell, pop singer Paula Abdul and music manager Randy Jackson.
