Perhaps she was unimpressed by the scale of the Great Wall of China, or maybe the ancient Terracotta Army fell short of her liking.

Either way, 12-year-old Sasha Obama looked bored as she toured China's most beautiful sites with her mother Michelle, sister Malia, 15, and grandmother, Marian Robinson.

The group are in China on a whirlwind good-will tour - but photographs have revealed that Sasha looks like she'd much rather be back home with her friends.

The president's daughter was also still nursing an apparently broken thumb in a white cast.

Not having fun? Sasha Obama rests her chin on her hand as she and her mother Michelle watch a performance on the top of an ancient city wall in Xi'an during their week-long trip to China

On Monday, they toured the ancient city of Xi'an but once they got to the City Wall, Sasha looked unimpressed with the 600-year-old relic. She leaned against it and rested her chin on her hand.

The family also visited the Terracotta 
Army - 8,000 terra-cotta warriors that were buried along with China's 
first emperor, Qin Shi Huang, around 210 BC as a way to protect him.

And when the first lady was greeted by a group of schoolchildren and jumped rope with them - much to the delight of her Chinese hosts - her daughters hung back and watched.

A day earlier, Sasha donned sunglasses for a walk on the Great Wall near Beijing, but while her big sister skipped and jumped in excitement ahead of her, she trailed behind.

Unimpressed: She manages to clap alongside her mother, big sister Malia and grandmother Marian Robinson

The family also visited a school in southwestern China and addressed students in remote Chinese communitiesvia webcam as Mrs Obama encouraged them not to let humble beginnings stop them from aiming high.

The First Lady quoted her own mother, saying that 'a good education is something that no one can take away from you'.

While the Obamas' trip has been largely 
successful, on Sunday, her motorcade was met with jeers from two people 
outside the U.S. embassy in Beijing.

Police and men in grey sweatshirts 
hurried to subdue the protestors, and it was unclear why they were 
shouting.

Fed up? Sasha looks unimpressed as she watched a Peking opera performance with a group of American schoolchildren who are visiting China during their spring break at the Summer Palace in Beijing

Quiet: While Michelle Obama grins and claps, her daughters seem less impressed by the spectacle

Silent: Sasha is less bothered about meeting Peng Liyuan, wife of President Xi Jinping, than her mother

Happy to be there? Sasha looks unsure as she goes to meet Chinese President Xi Jinping and his wife Peng Liyuan at the Diaoyutai State guest house in Beijing with her sister and mother last week

During the weeklong trip, the family - including Michelle Obama's mother - is staying at the five-star Westin hotel, where they are reportedly paying $8,400 per night.

This is both Mrs Obama and the girls' first trip in China - and Mrs Obama's third international trip without her husband since becoming First Lady.

White House representatives hope that the visit will build non-political bridges with China.

Mrs Obama has largely avoided political issues on her trip, although she made a strong statement on behalf of free expression, choice of religion and access to information during at the Stanford Center at Peking University in Beijing.
