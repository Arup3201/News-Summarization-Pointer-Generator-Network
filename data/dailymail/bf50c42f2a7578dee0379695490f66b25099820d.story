David Oliver Relin, the co-author of the best-selling novel Three Cups of Tea, has committed suicide at age 49, a year after details of the book were called into question.

Relin killed himself in the Portland-area town of Corbett, Oregon on November 14 and died of a blunt force head injury, medical examiners said. They declined to provide any further details.

His family said the married author and humanitarian journalist 'suffered from depression' and that a police statement providing more information would be released this week.

Relin co-wrote Three Cups of Tea with Greg Mortenson, which recounts how Mortenson built schools in Pakistan and Afghanistan. Relin suffered 
emotionally and financially after readers and critics doubted facts in 
the book.

The book, which has sold four million copies since it was published in 2006, came under scrutiny in April last year when '60 Minutes' and Jon Krakauer claimed it contained numerous fabrications, and even sparked a court case.

The book had been conceived as a way to raise money and tell the story of the 
Montana-based Central Asia Institute, which Mortenson co-founded in 1996 to build 
schools.

But readers alleged that some of the schools Mortenson's charity, the Central Asia Institute, claimed it had set up either did not exist
or were built by other charities.

Also doubted was Mortenson's account that he stumbled into the village of Korphe in Pakistan after trying to climb a mountain, and decided to build a school there after the residents saved him.

His previous writings had made no 
mention of his being lost or wandering into Korphe, and he also 
previously indicated that he originally planned to build the first 
school in another village.

Another claim, that he was kidnapped by Taliban on a visit in July 1996, was said to be untrue.

Mansur Khan Mahuud, allegedly pictured as one of his 'Taliban' captors, is the research director of an Islamabad think tank and told 60 Minutes that the men were not kidnappers, but protectors: 'This is totally false and he is lying. He was not kidnapped.'

Scrutiny: The authors came under fire for allegedly fabricating parts of the best-selling book

And there were also claims that his charity 
had mismanaged funds and that a chunk of money had been used to promote 
the book, rather than support his schools.

In April, a judge rejected a lawsuit 
by four people who bought the book, who claimed the authors, the 
publisher, and the charity had conspired to 
make Mortenson into a false hero to sell books.

U.S. District Judge Sam Haddon
called the claims overly broad, flimsy and speculative.

Mortenson
had denied any wrongdoing, though he has acknowledged there were 'some omissions and compressions' in the book. He agreed to repay the charity more than $1 million
for travel and 'personal charges' he made as he promoted the book.

Relin did not speak publicly 
about the charges, but he hired a lawyer to defend himself in the lawsuit.

The book's agent, Elizabeth Kaplan, said that the relationship between Relin and Mortenson had been difficult from the outset, the New York Times reported.

Mortenson was often hard to contact as he travelled to remote areas, and Relin also spoke publicly about how Mortenson should not have been named as a co-author.

And, as Mortenson address critics of the book during an April 2011 interview with Outside magazine, he attempted to direct the blame away from himself.

He said that Relin did 'nearly all the writing' and that the two collaborated to create 'the narrative arc'.

'What happens then is, when you re-create the scenes, you have my recollections, the different memories of those involved, you have his writing, and sometimes things come out different,' he said.

'In order to be convenient, there 
were some omissions. If we included everything I did from 1993 to 2003 
it would take three books to write it. So there were some omissions and compressions, and... I don't know, what that's called?'

The
legal wranglings came after Relin, who was born in Rochester and lived in Portland, had 
enjoyed a stellar career as a humanitarian journalist committed to 
telling stories about young people in need.

He
also reported from East Asia, and spent two years writing about 
Vietnam's growing educational and financial stability after he spent a 
year traveling through the country on bicycle in 1992.

According to one online biography, he won more than 40 national awards for his work.

'He felt his causes passionately,' Lee Kravitz, the former editor 
of Parade who hired Relin for various publications throughout the 1990s, told the New York Times.

'Dishonest': But critics claimed some parts of the book had been fabricated and Mortenson, left, later admitted some facts were wrong. Relin suffered emotionally and financially in the aftermath

'He 
especially cared about young people. I always assigned him to stories 
that would inspire people to take action to improve their lives.'

He leaves behind his wife, Dawn, 47, his mother, his stepfather and two sisters.

He had also completed a new book, which will be published in the spring, about two doctors working to cure cataract-related blindness in the developing world, the Times reported.

Mortenson, 52, lives in Montana with his wife, a clinical psychologist, and their two young children.

His biography describes him as 'a living hero to rural communities of Afghanistan and Pakistan, where he has gained the trust of Islamic leaders, military and militia commanders, government officials and tribal chiefs from his tireless effort to champion education, especially for girls.'
