A University basketball player is in recovery after being hit by a police car as she crossed a road in Delaware, Ohio.

Caroline Welker, 21, was heading over a crosswalk shortly after midnight on Thanksgiving when a police car sent her tumbling down the road.

Ms Welker, a player for Ohio Wesleyan University, suffered bruises and a concussion after Officer Mark Jackson hit her on his way to a disturbance call at a restaurant.

Officer Jackson admitted to not seeing Ms Welker in the crosswalk, and was charged with failure to yield.

‘I have a concussion, and I'm really sore. But thankfully no broken bones,’ Ms Welker told NBC4.

‘Ofc. Jackson is a hardworking and dedicated officer, serving with the Delaware Police Department for ten years,’ Delaware Police Chief Bruce Pijanowski said in a statement.

In a hurry: Officer Jackson was on his way to tend to a disturbance call at a nearby restaurant when he ran over Ms Welker

Trouble: Officer Walker, who had been cautioned over a crash just two days earlier, rushes over to check on the woman lying in the street

‘Ofc. Jackson acted appropriately after the incident. He immediately called for a medic and rendered first aid.  He fully cooperated with the investigation. 

‘Pursuant to standard procedure, a urine sample was collected for analysis, the results of which are still pending’

Delaware Police do not anticipate that alcohol or drugs were involved in the incident and Officer Jackson has paid a $135 fine for hitting Ms Walker after waiving a court appearance.
