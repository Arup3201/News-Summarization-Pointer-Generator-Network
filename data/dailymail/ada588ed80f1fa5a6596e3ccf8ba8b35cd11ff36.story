His unassuming lifestyle has been likened to the simplicity favoured by the new Pope Francis

The Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, has revealed that he travels by bus and orders deliveries of pizza to his medieval London residence, Lambeth Palace.

Speaking two months after being enthroned amid pomp and ceremony in Canterbury Cathedral, the former oil executive also admitted he buys most of his clothes from charity shops such as Oxfam.

In an intriguing insight into his down-to-earth style, Archbishop Welby, 57, who has been a fierce critic of the banks’ bonus culture, said that though he is supplied with a car and a chauffeur as part of the job, he prefers taking the bus or Tube.

But he said he is increasingly recognised by fellow passengers and has been asked: ‘Are you that Archbishop chap?’

Archbishop Welby, an Old Etonian, also told of the difficulties getting takeaways delivered to the imposing Lambeth Palace, where he lives with wife Caroline and their two youngest children.

He said that despite the prominence of the crenelated, red-brick building, which is on the opposite side of the Thames to the Houses of Parliament, delivery drivers often get lost.

He said: ‘So they ring up and say, “This Lambeth Palace, where is it?” And I say, where are you?  “I’m by Lambeth Bridge.” OK.  Can you see a 60ft-tall red brick gatehouse? “No.” ’

The Archbishop said he usually has to find the driver and collect the pizza himself.

His unassuming lifestyle has been likened to the simplicity favoured by the new Pope Francis, who travelled back to his hotel in a bus with fellow cardinals immediately after his election.

Like the Pope, Archbishop Welby is an avid tweeter, though his 29,000 followers are dwarfed by the Pontiff’s 2.5 million.

But in an interview with the Financial Times he was reluctant  o discuss in detail his views  on homosexuality.

He said, however, that the Church was right to uphold high standards in its teaching on sex even if people fail to meet them, adding: ‘To abandon the ideal simply because it is difficult to achieve is ridiculous.’
