Serial killer: Ivan Milat, pictured, killed seven people. A teenage relative of his has admitted to killing a 17-year-old boy with an axe

A teenage relative of Australian serial killer Ivan Milat boasted to friends about having murdered a 17-year-old boy with an axe.

Referring to Milat, known as the Backpacker Murderer, the boy said: 'You know me, you know my family... I did what they do.'

Shocking documents before a children's court near Sydney revealed that the boy told friends the day after the murder: 'I killed somebody last night.

'At one stage, the axe got stuck, so I had to kick the back of his head to get it loose.' 

According to the papers the teenager, who cannot be named  for legal reasons, also told friends that he was going to murder someone on the night of the killing, but they thought he was joking.

Victim David Auchterlonie, the teenager and two other friends drove to Belanglo Forest, south-west of Sydney, on a night in November last year. It was David's birthday. He had just turned 17.

Belanglo Forest is where Milat dumped the bodies of his seven backpacking victims between 1989 and 1992. Two of them were British girls.

According to the papers before Campbelltown Children's Court, David's brutal cold-blooded murder and about 15 minutes of dialogue were captured on a video recording on one of the teenager's mobile phones.

Victims: Ivan Milat killed seven people - including Joanne Walters, bottom left, and Caroline Clarke, third from left on bottom, and dumped their bodies in Belanglo forest between 1989 and 1992

The video shows the victim rolling a marijuana 
cigarette in the front seat when the teenager, who is standing by the 
boot, calls out to him. David gets out of the car and a double-edged axe
is swung into his torso.

Ivan Milat, who came to be known as the Backpacker Murderer, was Australia's worst serial killer.

Among his victims were Britons Caroline Clarke and Joanne Walters, both 22.

They were kidnapped,
shot and stabbed to death by Milat after he picked them up while they 
were hitchhiking in 1992.

Their bodies were found in the Belanglo Forest, 80 miles south-west of Sydney, in September that year.

Miss Clarke, from Northumberland, had been shot several times in the head while Miss Walters, from  south Wales, had been stabbed nine times.

Despite a search of the forest over following days no other bodies were found, but a year later a local man discovered a skull. Police returned to the forest and found five more bodies of backpackers who had been murdered in previous years.

Milat, who is now 66, was arrested after British backpacker Paul Onions managed to escape and give police details of his attacker.

As well as his two British victims, Milat killed a German backpacking couple, a German woman who was hitchhiking alone, and two young travellers from Melbourne.

He is serving seven life sentences.

The teenager says to him: 'From what I've heard, you're the one 
who's going around telling people about the money that I stole from my 
mum's house.'

'I swear to God, I haven't,' David replies.

The accused says: 'Shut the f**k up' before directing David to lie on the ground face down and to stay still.

For a further ten minutes, he threatens the victim and urges him to confess to spreading rumours.

'You move, I chop your head off, ' he says.

According to court documents, the phone then records the sound of an axe hitting the victim.

The police statement said: 'Whilst the victim was lying with his head on the ground, the accused swung back the axe and hit the deceased in the back of the head, where the axe remained lodged in the deceased's skull.

'The deceased died instantly, and the sound of the air leaving his body is also captured on the recording.'

The documents state that the teenager pulled the axe out of David's head by dragging him across the road. 

He and another boy then covered the body with branches before all three left the forest in the vehicle.

The accused teenager, who appeared via audio-visual link, showed no emotion as his lawyer entered his guilty plea.

He will be sentenced in the Supreme Court in Sydney on December 2.

Relatives of David Auchterlonie have called for a life sentence with the order 'never to be released'.
