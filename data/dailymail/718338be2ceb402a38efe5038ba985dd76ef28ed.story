A 93-year-old man has been charged with 170,000 counts of accessory to murder on allegations he served as an SS guard at the Nazis' Auschwitz death camp in occupied Poland.

The defendant, whose name wasn't disclosed in line with privacy laws, allegedly served in Auschwitz from January 1942 to June 1944, the Detmold state court said yesterday.

It is claimed the man was assigned to the Auschwitz I camp but also helped supervise new prisoners, largely Jews, as they arrived in Auschwitz-Birkenau, the part of the camp complex where most of its 1.1million victims were killed.

Defense attorney Johannes Salmen said his client has acknowledged being at Auschwitz I, but denies being assigned to Birkenau or being involved in killings.

The North-Rhine Westphalia centre said the accused was deployed to the Nazi death camp in January 1942, according to The Local.

There, he worked as a member of the SS Death's Head guard battalion and was responsible for guarding trains of Jews arriving at the death camp.

He is also alleged to have worked in 'selection', which involved marking newly-arrived inmates for immediate death or sending them to work.

It comes just months after Oskar Groening, also 93, was charged with 300,000 counts of accessory to murder for his role as a guard at the camp.

The sergeant worked at the camp in German occupied Poland for two-and-a-half years and he was charged with sorting the possessions of the inmates and collecting and tallying any money that was on them.

At least 1.1 million prisoners died at Auschwitz, around 90 per cent of them Jewish.

In one period between May and June 1944, 425,000 Hungarian Jews went there and around 300,000 were immediately sent to the gas chambers.

He was never punished after the war, a tribunal cleared him of involvement in 1948, but Groening - who worked as the manager of a glass factory - has openly talked about his time as a guard and said that he witnessed atrocities.

Groening, who lives near the Lueneburg Heath in Lower Saxony, is one of around 30 former Auschwitz guards who federal investigators recommended last year that state prosecutors pursue charges against under a new precedent in German law.

Groening himself has openly talked about his time as a guard and said while he witnessed horrific atrocities, he didn't commit any crimes himself.

In 2005, he told Der Spiegel magazine he recalled one incident on 'ramp duty' when he heard a baby crying. 'I saw another SS soldier grab the baby by the legs,' he said. 'He smashed the baby's head against the iron side of a truck until it was silent.'
