Backlash: Account holders are outraged to discover they have been paying up to £300 a year for perks

Banks are suffering a customer backlash over claims they widely mis-sold fee-paying packaged accounts, official figures reveal today.

There have been thousands of complaints from account holders who say they have paid up to £300 a year for perks which they never knew existed…and did not want.

In the worst cases, consumers claim they were unwittingly signed up to these ‘rip-off’ deals and the fees automatically docked from their account.

Many were sold the accounts by pushy staff at the high street banks who were paid commissions for meeting sales targets.

Figures show how the Financial Ombudsman Service has seen complaints about packaged accounts soar by 155 per cent in the past nine months. It is now receiving dozens every day. And it is finding in favour of customers in eight out of ten cases.

The Ombudsman says most of the complaints are about the way the account was sold. Many did not even realise they were paying for a packaged account as they had been ‘upgraded’ without being told.

Some had been misled into believing a fee-charging account was their only option or were told they had to take it out to get the loan or mortgage they wanted.

Others were lured into forking out for insurance policies only to later discover they were ineligible to claim on the cover they were paying for.

The banks are now being forced to pay out thousands of pounds in compensation in the latest scandal to engulf them. They have already shelled out £13.3billion in compensation for mis-sold payment protection insurance.

An estimated one in five adults has an expensive packaged account, such as Lloyds Bank’s Premier, which costs £25 a month, the Barclays Additions Active account at £15 a month, and Halifax’s Ultimate Reward account at £12.50 a month.

Complaints: Customers claim 'pushy' staff who get commission for sales encourage them to buy certain deals

Typical perks include travel insurance, breakdown cover, mobile phone insurance and even home contents insurance.

Customers may also be offered low-cost loans and bigger overdrafts.

But a report by the financial regulator estimated a third of these account holders fail to use the benefits for which they are paying up to £300 a year. It also found many were unable to claim when they needed to.

Pensioners would not be covered by the travel insurance policy because they were too old or had a medical condition, or households without a car were paying for a useless breakdown policy.

Rules brought in by the Financial Conduct Authority last March mean all banks must ensure the bolt-on insurance policies are suitable for the customer – and are clear and simple to understand.

On top of this banks must send out a letter to all customers every year reminding them they have the account, and to check they are still eligible to claim. Which? executive director Richard Lloyd, said:

Lloyds Bank's Premier, £25 a month, Barclays Additions Active account, £15 a month, and Halifax's Ultimate Reward account, £12.50 a month, are among the deals that were raised with the Financial Ombudsman Service

‘It’s extremely worrying to see an increase in complaints about packaged accounts when new rules were introduced last year to protect consumers from being sold products that they don’t need or can’t use.

‘The Financial Conduct Authority must rigorously enforce the rules to prevent mis-selling and take action against any bank that links staff bonuses to the sale of these products.’

A year ago the Ombudsman received barely 40 complaints a week about packaged accounts. But in the past nine months it has dealt with 3,107 – 155 per cent more than the rate in the previous financial year.

And these are only those that have been rejected by the banks. This could mean the true number of complaints and compensation payouts is much higher.

A spokesman for the Ombudsman says: ‘The good news is banks are reacting differently to how they did with PPI, when they fought us every step of the way.’
