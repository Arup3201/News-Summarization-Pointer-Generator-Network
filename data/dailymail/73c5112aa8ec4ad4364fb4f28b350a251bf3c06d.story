Joe Launchbury played a prominent role in the recent video promoting the release of World Cup tickets and believes there will be a scramble for seats when the public sale begins on Friday.

Wasps’ England lock was among the home players addressed by actor Charles Dance in the ‘Too Big to Miss’ video shot in a Twickenham changing room as tournament authorities prepared for the launch of the main ticket application process.

Despite high prices, there is likely to be huge demand for many of the 48 matches and Launchbury said on Wednesday that the sales drive would bring the World Cup into greater focus for those hoping to be involved.

Auckland’s Eden Park, the venue for New Zealand’s 2011 triumph, is the only ground to have staged the final twice, having also done so in 1987

‘It does feel like it’s getting quite close now,’ he said. ‘I was chatting to some of my friends the other day and they were looking forward to when all the tickets are coming out. They’ve all been saving up! I imagine all the tickets will go pretty quickly.’

For the 23-year-old and the other players looking forward to a starring role in the global gathering on these shores a year from now, the challenge this season will be to keep minds focused on club duties while not losing sight of the bigger picture. Yet Launchbury insisted the England squad are used to this balancing of priorities.

‘It is no different from any other season in a way because you have chunks at your club and chunks when you are off playing international rugby,’ he added. ‘The World Cup is there in the background as something to get excited about, but for now we have to concentrate on what is coming up.’

England will spend a fortnight in Denver, Colorado, next July as part of their World Cup preparations and Wales coach Warren Gatland revealed on Wednesday that his squad will have stints in the Swiss Alps and the desert in Qatar.

Which matches go on sale on Friday?

All 48 games. Fans can apply for up to four tickets per game. For 15 pool matches fans may request up to 15 tickets.

Application period?

Public sales begin on Friday and run until September 29. It’s not first come, first served, so there’s no rush to apply.

Where to apply?

On the official website, www.tickets.rugbyworldcup.com. Create an account to begin.

How will purchases be confirmed?

The application process will be finalised next month. If matches or price categories are over-subscribed, a ballot decides who gets the tickets.

Can I apply more than once?

Only one application is permitted per person — for just one or multiple games — but it is possible to edit or withdraw an application at any time during the process.

Cost of tickets?

Some seats cost as little as £15 for adults and £7 for children, but they go up to a high of £315 for pool games and £715 for the final.

Are England games affordable?

Prices are steep. The four price categories for their opening Pool A clash with Fiji are £75, £160, £215 and £315.

Concessions?

There are child prices for 41 of the 48 games, but not for the knockout fixtures, aside from the low-key ‘bronze medal match’.

Why so expensive?

This is the knock-on effect of the last World Cup, held in New Zealand, generating modest profits. Organisers need to meet an £80million guarantee to the IRB.

Any tickets been sold already?

Some 500,000 tickets went on sale to the ‘rugby community’ in May. Fan tour packages for the overseas market went on sale in January; hospitality packages have been available since February.

Any tips to secure tickets?

The application process features the ‘Match Manager’ element which regulates how many games you aim for and your potential spend. The ‘Increase Your Chances’ feature means if a match and category are over-subscribed, the next best category can be allocated instead.

Additional booking fees?

Not if applicants use a debit card or the credit card used is MasterCard — an official partner — but there is a two per cent charge for other credit cards.
