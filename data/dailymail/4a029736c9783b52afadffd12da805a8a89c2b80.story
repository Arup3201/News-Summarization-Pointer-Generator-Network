One resident got a rude awakening when police with assault rifles surrounded his home after a tree removal crew mistakenly reported he had a gun.

Michael Smith, of Norridgewock, Maine, was woken up by the authorities when a crew contacted by a utility company to trim branches near some power lines notified the police at 10am on Tuesday.

Smith went outside shirtless to yell at the crew to leave, exposing a life-sized tattoo of a gun he had on his stomach.

The workers mistook it for an actual weapon, and notified authorities to the home located off Ward Hill Road.

Smith was not charged and said the tattoo has never been a problem before. Smith has multiple tattoos, including several covering his left arm.

'Obviously it was a misunderstanding and he didn't have a weapon, but we had to respond to the initial report as if he did,' Maine State police trooper Scott Duff told the Morning Sentinel.

Smith, who works nights, said it sounded like someone was driving up his driveway and crushing a thick layer of ice on it.

He went outside to tell the crew to leave his property, and they told him no problem. But one worker said he thought he noticed a pistol in Smith's waistband.  

Duff said he didn't think Smith went outside with his shirt off deliberately to make it appear he was carrying a gun.

'I got plans today. I didn't want to get shot,' Smith told the Morning Sentinel.
