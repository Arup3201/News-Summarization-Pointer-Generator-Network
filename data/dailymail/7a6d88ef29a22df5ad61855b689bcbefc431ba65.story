Lionel Messi has been struggling at the World Cup because he is exhausted, the Argentina superstar's father has admitted ahead of Sunday's final against Germany.

Messi failed to make any impact in both the quarter-final against Belgium and the semi-final against Holland, but Argentina have managed to scrape through on both occasions. Against the mighty Germans, however, Messi will be expected to deliver a matchwinning performance if his side are to lift the trophy in the Maracana.

But statistics show that Messi has covered less distance on the pitch than any outfield player who has played six games at this World Cup, apart from Brazil's much-maligned striker Fred.

'Leo (Messi) said it looked like his legs weighed 100 kilos. He was very tired,' Jorge Messi told Brazilian newspaper Folha de S.Paulo when asked about his son's anonymous performance over 120 minutes against the Dutch.

Messi had been one of the stars of the tournament in the group stages, where he scored four goals in the opening three games. The 27-year-old forward then set up Angel Di Maria's late extra-time winner against Switzerland with a marvellous piece of skill, but hos contribution has been next to nothing since then.

The four-time Ballon d'Or winner has covered 51.9km during Argentina's run to the World Cup final, while Fred, who has been criticised for his lack of movement, has moved 47.2km.

The next lowest is Holland's defensive midfielder Georginio Wijnaldum on 53.9km. But a host of players have covered more ground despite playing less games less than Messi, including Marcelo Diaz of Chile and Michael Bradley of USA, who have both played two whole games less.

Wesley Sneijder (69.6km), Arjen Robben (69.1km) and Thomas Muller (68.8km) are the three players to have covered the most ground so far. 

Flop: Fred is the only player to have played six games at the World Cup who has run less than Messi

Most distance covered in World Cup (of players who have featured in six games):

Wesley Sneijder - 69.6km

Arjen Robben  - 69.1km

Thomas Muller - 68.8km 

Least distance covered in World Cup (of players who have featured in six games):

Georginio Wijnaldum - 53.9km

Lionel Messi - 51.9km

Fred - 47.2km

Sportsmail's Jamie Carragher has suggested that Messi's lack of running could be in order to protect his suspect hamstring, which caused him to miss a lot of the season with Barcelona. But Carragher also believes Messi is changing hisa game and becoming more of an old-fashioned playmaker.

'He doesn’t seem to be running as much, he is waiting for the ball,' Wrote Carragher after the last-16 victory over Switzerland. 'His running stats were the lowest on the pitch against Switzerland, which is evidence of the change in his game - but he caused maximum trouble and won the match for Argentina.

'The more I study his performances, the more I believe he’s in control and waiting for that moment to arrive when he can make a difference.'
