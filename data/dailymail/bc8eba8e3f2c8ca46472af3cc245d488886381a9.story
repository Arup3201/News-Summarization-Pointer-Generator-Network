Ms Kenny was fined $1200 and disqualified from driving for 11 months after recording a blood alcohol reading of 0.23 per cent while driving in November

The daughter of former Olympian Lisa Curry and former Ironman Grant Kenny, was caught driving while more than four times over the legal alcohol level, a court has heard.

Jaimi Lee Kenny was found to have a blood alcohol reading of 0.23 per cent when she was stopped by police on the Sunshine Motorway at Mountain Creek on November 29.

The 27-year-old appeared at Maroochydore Magistrates Court on Thursday, where she was fined $1200 and disqualified from holding or obtaining a license for 11 months, The Courier Mail reports.

The sentence is likely to impact on Ms Kenny's job, according to her lawyer Chelsea Emery, which involves privately taking care of and driving around children.

Ms Kenny told police that she had been drinking since 8:30 that morning, Prosecutor Sergeant Leonie Scott said.

'The defendant further stated she wasn't sure but she drank up to 16 stubbies of Strongbow cider,' Ms Scott said, according to The Courier Mail.

'The defendant admitted to police that she had an alcohol problem and that she sought help in relation to this.'

Ms Emery told the court that Ms Kenny had suffered from anxiety since the age of 14 and had contacted her psychiatrist prior to being stopped by police.

She said that Ms Kenny had begun drinking to 'self-medicate' when a relationship of hers failed two years ago.

'But it is a problem that she recognises and she has some insight in relation to as she was obviously extremely co-operative with police and very open and honest about that,' Ms Emery said.
