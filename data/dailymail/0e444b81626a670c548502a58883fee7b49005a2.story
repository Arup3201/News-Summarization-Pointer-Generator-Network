The bodyguard employed to protect Jackie Kennedy on the day John F Kennedy was assassinated today revealed the decades of guilt he suffered because the President was killed on his watch.

Speaking on the 49th anniversary of the shooting, secret service agent Clint Hill feels he 'completely failed in my responsibilities' despite being awarded the highest medal for bravery after JFK's death.

The 80-year-old, who was walking alongside the motorcade at the time, recalled how he tried to throw himself between the Kennedys and the shooter as the bullets rained in.

'I wasn't thinking of my own safety. I thought "I have to shield them",' he said.

After the first two shots were fired,
Mr Hill could see Mrs Kennedy reaching for a piece of her husband's 
head as he leapt into their limousine.

But he could not reach them in time 
before a third bullet struck the President.

In
his memoir, Mrs Kennedy And Me, Mr Hill said of the final shot: 'The 
impact was like the sound of something hard hitting a melon shattering 
into cement.

'In the same 
instant, blood, brain matter and bone fragments exploded from the back 
of the President's head... and splattered all over me - on my face, my 
clothes, in my hair.'

The heartbreaking scene came just minutes after John F. Kennedy was hit in the neck and head by accused gunman Lee Harvey Oswald while driving through Dallas, Texas in November 22, 1963.

With Mrs Kennedy cradling her 
husband's head in her arms - 'her eyes filled with terror' - the 
limousine sped to Parkland Memorial Hospital.

She
didn't want to let him go 'because of how he looked, so I took my coat 
off and covered his head and upper back', Mr Hill recounted.

Later, as a 
doctor approached the group, they knew it was terrible news and Mrs 
Kennedy ran to be at her husband's side. An agent approached Hill and 
told him the president had died.

Speaking to The Times newspaper nearly five decades later, Mr Hill added: 'I completely failed in my responsibilities. The President was 
killed on my duty.'

Later, his book recounts, Mr Hill accompanied Mrs Kennedy and Robert Kennedy to see the body.

Hill remembers how, once there, Mrs 
Kennedy lovingly cut her husband's hair with scissors, leaving chestnut 
locks on the blades when she gave them back.

With Mrs Kennedy cradling her 
husband's head in her arms - 'her eyes filled with terror' - the 
limousine sped to Parkland Memorial Hospital.

She
didn't want to let him go 'because of how he looked, so I took my coat 
off and covered his head and upper back', Mr Hill recounted.

He then accompanied Mrs Kennedy when 
JFK's successor Lyndon Johnson was sworn in. She was still wearing her 
blood-splattered suit.

'We tried to convince her to change her clothes, but she refused,' he wrote. 'Let them see what they have done,' she said.

Hill, who lives in Virginia,
continued to work as Mrs Kennedy's agent for a further year after the 
assassination before going on to become Lyndon Johnson's special 
protection agent.

But he quit in 1975 over the guilt he felt
from the shooting. He smoked and drank scotch 'to sleep, forget.'

He kept in touch with Mrs Kennedy 
for a few years after he stopped working for her, but when he heard 
about her struggle with cancer in 1994, he could not bring himself to 
lift the phone.

'I knew 
that the mere sound of my voice would take her back to that day that 
changed everything,' he wrote. 'And the sound of her voice would do the 
same to me.'

She died on May 19, 1994, at the age of 64.

Over the years, Mr Hill says, although he still feels a failure, he has finally come to realise he 'did all I could given the circumstances' and is now 'happier than I have ever been'.

Lee Harvey 
Oswald was accused of firing the three shots that killed John F. 
Kennedy. As he was being transferred to jail, he was shot in the stomach
by a man, Jack Ruby, in the crowd.

He died in the hospital where Kennedy had passed away 48 hours earlier.
