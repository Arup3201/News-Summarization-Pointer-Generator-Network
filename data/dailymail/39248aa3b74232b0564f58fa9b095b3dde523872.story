The western US will face increasingly severe mega-droughts later this century if no action is taken to curb climate change, researchers have warned.

They say that 'unprecedented drought conditions' - the worst in more than 1,000 years - are likely to come to the Southwest and Central Plains after 2050 and persist because of global warming.

It is the first study to predict that the coming intense dry spells could exceed the decades-long mega-droughts that occurred centuries ago and are blamed for the demise of certain civilisations in the late 13th century. 

Researchers say the current mega-drought in the US is going to get worse. They say there will be more and more droughts starting in 2050. And there's an 80% chance one could last at least 35 years. Pictured is a warning buoy sitting on the dry, cracked bed of Lake Mendocino near Ukiah, California

'Nearly every year is going to be dry toward the end of the 21st century compared to what we think of as normal conditions now,' said study lead author Dr Benjamin Cook, a Nasa atmospheric scientist.

'We're going to have to think about a much drier future in western North America.'

According to the study, published in the journal Science Advances, there is a more than 80 per cent chance that much of central and the western US will have a mega-drought lasting at least 35 years later this century.

'Water in the Southwest is going to become more precious than it already is,' said study co-author Dr Toby Ault of Cornell University

Since the year 2000, seven western states in the US has seen their driest periods in centuries.

These states are Arizona, California, Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico, Utah and Wyoming

And scientists in California have warned that the region may be experiencing a century-long 'mega-drought'.

The warnings came after sediment studies showed California is currently experiencing the driest spell since 1580, and that the regular rainfall seen during the last century is likely to have been a temporary deviation in a cycle of droughts and very occasional rainfall over the last 3,000 years.

In 2013, California received less rain than in any year since its formation as a state in 1850.

However droughts lasting more than 100 years are far from unheard of in the state.

Looking back over several thousand years, droughts have been known to last over a decade, and in some cases they can last a century.

And the patterns tend to repeat, meaning another drought of this length will probably happen again in the future. 

'I was honestly surprised at just how dry the future is likely to be.'

'I look at these future mega-droughts like a slow moving natural disaster. We have to put mega-droughts into the same category as other natural disasters that can be dealt with through risk management.'

The study is based on the current increasing rate of rising emissions of carbon dioxide and complex simulations run by 17 different computer models, which generally agreed on the outcome, according to the researchers. 

The regions looked at include California, Nevada, Utah, Colorado, New Mexico, Arizona, northern Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, Nebraska, South Dakota, most of Iowa, southern Minnesota, western Missouri, western Arkansas, and northwestern Louisiana.

Looking back in records trapped in tree ring and other data, there were mega-droughts in the Southwest and Central Plains in the 1100s and 1200s that lasted several decades, but these future ones will be worse, Dr Cook said.

Those were natural and not caused by climate change, unlike those forecast for the future. 

'Natural droughts like the 1930s Dust Bowl and the current drought in the Southwest have historically lasted maybe a decade or a little less,' said Dr Cook.

'What these results are saying is we're going to get a drought similar to those events, but it is probably going to last at least 30 to 35 years.' 

Because of changes in the climate, the Southwest will see less rain. But for both regions the biggest problem will be the heat, which will increase evaporation and dry out the soil.

The result is a vicious cycle: The air grows even drier, and hotter, Dr Cook said.

Nasa scientists used tree rings to understand past droughts and climate models incorporating soil moisture data to estimate future drought risk in the 21st century (shown)

Scientists had already figured that climate change would increase the odds of worse droughts in the future, but this study makes it look worse and adds to a chorus of strong research, said Dr Jonathan Overpeck, co-director of the Institute of the Environment at the University of Arizona.

'These results are not surprising, but are eye-opening nonetheless,' said Dr Overpeck, who wasn't part of the research.

The risks and dangers are worse today because of the larger population and greater dependence on water resources, scientists warned.

'We are the first to do this kind of quantitative comparison between the projections and the distant past, and the story is a bit bleak,' said Dr Jason Smerdon, a co-author and climate scientist at the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, part of the Earth Institute at Columbia University.

'Even when selecting for the worst mega-drought-dominated period, the 21st century projections make the [previous] mega-droughts seem like quaint walks through the Garden of Eden.'

Researchers also projected a continued rise in emissions of the greenhouse gases that contribute to global warming, and looked at a scenario in which actions were taken to cut back on greenhouse gases resulting in lower emissions. Both approaches raised concern for the future.

'The results... are extremely unfavourable for the continuation of agricultural and water resource management as they are currently practiced in the Great Plains and southwestern United States,' said Dr David Stahle, professor in the Department of Geosciences at the University of Arkansas, who was not involved in the study.

Currently the western United States has been experiencing a drought for about 11 of the past 14 years.

The dry area spans California, Nevada, New Mexico, Arizona, Texas and Oklahoma and other parts of the region, directly affecting more than 64 million people.
