To understand why Kobane is doomed, you only have to stand on a nearby hillside and watch as the Islamic State maniacs tighten their grip.

A few hundred yards away, the besieged town was in flames again yesterday as the jihadis fired mortar bombs into densely-packed neighbourhoods.

Every explosive thud and pillar of smoke signifies yet more deaths, as the men, women and children of the stricken Syrian frontier town desperately fight to the last.

It is a deeply uneasy feeling to witness this life-and-death struggle against a terrorist state while standing in Turkey, a country that regards itself as European.

Photographer Jamie Wiseman and I watched as American warplanes dropped bombs on Islamic State positions in the east of Kobane, only for the terrorists to pop up elsewhere and launch another volley of mortars into civilian areas.

Their menacing black flag has fluttered from at least two roof-tops for several days.

Nato ground forces are but half a mile away. Ranged on the hills overlooking Kobane are rows of Turkish army tanks bristling with fire-power.

At first glance, it looks as if this means the cavalry has arrived, ready to sweep into Kobane and offer protection at last to the wretched townsfolk.

Surely, you think, it is possible for them to drive just a few hundred yards further, into Syria, and start to disperse the Islamic State fanatics into retreat?

But the facts are very different.

Although Turkey, with the second largest army in Nato and keen to join the EU, has pledged ‘to do everything’ it can to prevent a massacre unfolding on Europe’s doorstep, in truth, it seems to suit the country’s rulers not to send in their tanks.

For, unlike every other Western government, Turkey - with its historic problems with the Kurdish minority - perversely considers Islamic State to be ‘an opportunity not a threat’.

Despite there being more than 30 airstrikes on Kobane (pictured) since Monday, Kurdish civilians remained trapped inside the city

At the border itself, rather than helping the Syrian Kurds in Kobane, the Turkish military is effectively contributing to the stranglehold by blocking reinforcements that the town so urgently needs.

Meanwhile, thousands of Kurds from across Turkey have descended on the border region in the past fortnight to support their Syrian kin.

They want to go across and fight, and their sense of betrayal is palpable as the tragedy of Kobane unfolds before their eyes on the other side of a wire fence.

Around mid-morning yesterday, a Turkish armoured vehicle zoomed across the desert, spreading clouds of dust. A gunner sitting on top started shouting at the Kurds, ordering them to retreat because Islamic State militants were shelling the nearby border crossing.

One man refused to leave, coughing on the dust and yelling back: ‘We will stay here. Our friends and cousins and children are there. We will not move. We don’t believe you. We want to fight IS, even if it is just with stones.’

Crowds of Kurdish refugees and Turkish residents flocked to the border with Syria today to watch the battle unfold in the distance

The aerial bombardment on Kobane continued throughout the day while Kurds on the Turkish side of the border could only watch on as they kin were killed in the clashes with ISIS militants

Yasar Igten, 42, a telecoms worker from Istanbul explained the impasse. ‘Those tanks are not here to help us. They will wait and watch, until all the Kurds have been killed by ISIS. They hate the Kurds.’

His view was echoed by Ergin Demurlapu, 40, who said: ‘We are so angry with the Turkish government because they are helping ISIS with money and weapons. Those tanks could help us, but they don’t.’

Others, though, are just glad to be out of the battle-zone.

Buzan, 35, a labourer who fled Kobane to Turkey five days ago with his family, is devastated as he stands beneath an olive tree and watches plumes of black smoke rise over his home town. His four children – twins aged three, a four-year-old girl and a five-year-old boy – cling to his leg. They are silent and just stare.

He says they just ‘ran for our lives’, leaving behind his uncle who was beheaded. He says his children are terrified and did not sleep for days. ‘I built our house, but ISIS have destroyed it. We are lucky to be alive.’

Inside Kobane, under siege for nearly a month, the hideous struggle goes on to prevent it from becoming another ISIS stronghold.

Men, women and children as young as ten bearing AK-47s are all that stand in the way of the butchering jihadis.

Images of gun-toting grandmothers, teenage girls in jeans and primary school-age boys, all vowing to fight to the last, have been tweeted around the world.

Some elderly people have refused to leave their homes, preferring to die there rather than be refugees in a foreign land.

One desperate woman, Arin Mirkan, even turned herself into a suicide bomber to kill a group of ISIS fighters.

It must be said that five days of US-led bombing raids have had some successes, pushing the extremists back to the edges of the town, which was about to fall a week ago.

The low whirr of Tornado fighter aircraft can also be heard in the skies before they drop their bombs.

We saw two bombs land yesterday, appearing to strike a hospital used by ISIS as a base in the east of the town, in which they already have a foothold.

But almost simultaneously, word spread that ISIS had captured the town’s prison, enabling them to release inmates to help join their cause.

ISIS has been able to use high-grade military kit that once belonged to the Americans and were looted from the Iraqi army. They include night-vision googles, meaning they can ambush the unsuspecting civilians of Kobane in the dead of night.

Already at least seven people have been beheaded, with subsequent gruesome displays made of their heads.

Those who escaped watch helplessly from the hillside overlooking the town.

‘We all have family and friends in there, but no one knows if they are still alive,’ said 38-year-old Ekrem Nassan. ‘We cannot contact them and are very worried about whether they have access to food and water.’

If ISIS succeeds in taking Kobane, the terror group will have seized an unbroken 125-mile stretch of border with Turkey.

The town will be subjected to a brutal regime in which anyone disobeying rules will have their head cut off or be crucified.

As the Turkish army is accused of standing idly by as atrocities are committed just yards away, parallels have been drawn with the Srebrenica massacre in Bosnia during the Balkans War in 1995, when 8,000 people were massacred.

Despite the U.S. air-strikes, the Kurds feel very vulnerable - confronting hostility a range of enemies with different historical reasons for seeking to kill them, control them, or rejoice that somebody else – even Islamic State – might do the dirty work for them.

Mamoudi Ahmad, 45, a Turkish Kurd, said yesterday: ‘Everyone hates the Kurds. The Turks hate us and will never save us. Meanwhile, [Syrian dictator] Bashar al-Assad would be happy to see us crushed. And Islamic State wants to turn Kobane into a medieval caliphate. We don’t have many friends.’

So while Turkey ought to be Nato’s first line of defence against the fundamentalists - and it must be said that most Turks are appalled at the savagery of ISIS, the terror group’s activities may not be entirely unwelcome to the government which fears encouraging the Kurdish separatist movement inside its own borders.

The crisis has seen explosive clashes in more than 20 cities as Kurds protested against the government’s aloof stance towards the stricken Syrian Kurds in Kobane.

More than 30 people have died including ten yesterday when gunmen opened fire on police in eastern Turkey.

Fighting in the small border city has raged for three weeks now in the face of determined jihadist advances

The airstrikes in Kobane (pictured) have not stopped ISIS forces from invading the city but have helped delay their advance

It's feared there could be a massacre of civilians if ISIS takes the city of Kobane (pictured), with thousands believed to be trapped either nearby or within the town

Six provinces in south-east Turkey have been placed under night-time curfew. Police have been meet the protesters with tear gas, sticks and water cannon, while angry Kurds have hurled stones and Molotov cocktails.

For the Kurds, the siege of Kobane has become a rallying cause likened to the infamous atrocity in Iraq in 1998 when the then Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein poisoned 5,000 Kurds at Halabja.

Diplomats believe Erdogan is cynically exploiting the IS threat to extract concessions from both the Americans and the Kurds. He is demanding a buffer zone inside Syria, policed by Turkey, and a commitment by Washington to overthrow Assad.

Writing in Middle East journal al-Monitor, author Amberin Zaman claimed this week: ‘Erdogan and his disciples view Kobane as an opportunity rather than a threat.’

Whatever the outcome of these international power games, time is running out for the benighted people of Kobane.

Caught in crossfire - both diplomatic and deadly real - all they can do is fight, pray and hope.
