Kirsten Farage is  paid £800 a month by the taxpayer – or £9,600 a year – as the Brussels assistant of fellow Ukip MEP Ray Finch

Nigel Farage's wife is being paid by the taxpayer to work in Brussels, it has emerged a day after he denied it on television.

The Ukip leader had insisted that his German wife Kirsten, who is employed as his assistant, is only paid by the party and does not receive a penny from public funds.

He was questioned about the arrangements during his bizarre appearance this week on ‘Steph and Dom Meet Nigel Farage’ featuring the drink-swilling bed and breakfast owners from Channel 4’s Gogglebox.

But a day after the programme was broadcast, it has emerged that Mrs Farage is in fact paid £800 a month by the taxpayer – or £9,600 a year – as the Brussels assistant of fellow Ukip MEP Ray Finch.

Yesterday a spokesman for Mr Farage admitted this was the case but said the reason for denying it was that her husband had been ‘completely unaware’ of this arrangement.

It was claimed that up until May this year Mr Farage did pay his second wife around £30,000-a-year until European Parliament rules outlawed the employment of family members.

Instead it was arranged Mrs Farage would be paid for her work by Ukip – but they could only afford £20,000, a spokesman said.

It the time the programme was filmed on July 22, Mr Farage was apparently unaware his wife had made an arrangement to top up her salary by working for Mr Finch since the start of that month.

On the programme, over several rounds of wine and pink champagne with the couple at their home in Sandwich in Kent, Dom Parker asked Mr Farage about his wife being ‘on the payroll in Brussels’.

Mr Farage replied: ‘She is no longer paid by the public sector’.

Asked if he had hired someone else, he said Mrs Farage was still doing the job but ‘not paid by the European Parliament, no. Absolutely not.’ He said she was paid by ‘the party’.

A Ukip spokesman said yesterday: ‘After the rules were changed so hiring spouses was no longer on, Nigel did a deal with the party that they would pick up the tab.

'I think he was still smarting a bit because he didn’t think there was anything wrong with paying his wife. What seems to have happened is that Kirsten then made a deal with Ray which Nigel was completely unaware of.

‘There is no way Nigel would have been so specific in saying she was not paid taxpayers money if he had known. He would have said one of my colleagues has chipped in.’

The spokesman added that she begun working for Mr Finch – as one of his seven assistants – on 1 July and added that her job had not changed.

'Kirsten has always worked for Nigel and others, and she still does, but in the past he had always picked up the tab. I cannot believe he would have deliberately lied in such a public forum about something so easy to check.’

All 751 MEPs are allowed to spend € 21,379 (£16,998) per month on staff. Since 2009, they have not been allowed to have close relatives among their staff.

But existing MEPs such as Mr Farage were allowed to continue to do so until the European elections under a transitional arrangement.

It has also been reported this week that Ukip has secured a £1.5million pot of European taxpayers cash by forming a new political grouping called the Alliance for Direct Democracy in Europe (ADDE).

The new party is dominated by Ukip, but some of the party’s own members have objected to taking the money as people would think Ukip were exploiting the EU gravy train.

But Roger Helmer MEP said it would stop the funds falling into the hands of ‘federalists’.
