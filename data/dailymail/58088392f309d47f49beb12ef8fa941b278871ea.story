Creative parents struggling to get their children to eat a healthy meal might look to this artist for some foodie inspiration.

These entertaining monster sandwich sculptures are painstakingly made from bread and various sandwich fillings, including sausage meat, olives, peppers and cheese.

The funny characters have been so well received in the art world that some have even been commissioned for TV-shirt prints.

Good enough to eat: At first they will make you laugh and then, perhaps, feel a little hungry

Skewered: New York artist Kasia Haupt's monster sandwiches have proven so popular they have been commissioned for TV-shirt prints

New York artist Kasia Haupt, 29, made her first sandwich-saurus while at design college. But it took a couple of years before she decided to make a collection of edible monsters and now devotes much of her time to her hobby.

Kasia said: 'I had the idea when I was going to design school in Atlanta. I wanted to make something unique and I've always loved food art, so I made a Sandwich-saurus as a one-time thing.

'Then a couple of years later, I stumbled upon that picture and decided I should be doing more with sandwiches than just eating them. I've been making a few monsters a month ever since.

Double act: The funny creations started off as a college project for artist Kasia

In demand: The amusing creations have proven so popular that Kasia is now being commissioned to make them for TV-shirt prints

Baguette head: It can take up to an hour to make a sandwich monster, but once completed, they don't last long, and are quickly eaten by herself and her fiance

'I haven't sold the sandwiches as food, only as commissioned art prints. People tell me I should open a deli - which would be fine as long as my customers don't mind waiting an hour or two for their lunch.'

Kasia said her life is always full of new sandwich ideas.

The olive eyes have it: While meat and cheese are 'versatile, easy to manipulate, and delicious' Kasia says she loves to use olives for eyes

Always experimenting with new ideas, Kasia likes to create scenes with her funny creations

She said: 'I get excited finding new types of bread and fillings to work with, but my favourite ingredients are meat and cheese because they just seem inherently funny to me.

'Plus they're versatile, easy to manipulate, and delicious. I also love the olive eyes. They give a consistency to my sandwiches, although I am considering branching out to new eyeball materials.

Amusing: Kasia's creations keep evolving, she says, as she comes up with new ideas every day

This rare piece is a copy of popular kids' character Hello Kitty - an exception among Kasia's collection of scary and funny monsters

I've made almost 50 monsters. The ideas are coming quicker to me and I'm getting faster at it, so lately I've making more and more.

'Building a sandwich can take anywhere from 30 minutes to a couple of hours. Then I can spend up to an hour shooting them in various positions and settings.

'I try to get done taking pictures as quickly as possible because as soon as they're done, they get to go to my belly - unless my fiance beats me to it.'

Irony: This clever design shows an American hot dog man, grilling sausages on a barbeque

Many of Kasia's creations appear to represent stereotypes from different nations. Can you guess which one this is?

Fill me in: A smorgasbord of ingredients is used adorn and stuff her her sandwiches, which are usually happily consumed by her fiance

While some of the sandwich monsters are funny, others are simply bizarre, but equally as appetising
