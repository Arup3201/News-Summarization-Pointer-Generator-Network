A surly David James refused an interview when he was approached at his hotel in Cochin, south India, where he is player-manager for the Kerala Blasters in the new Indian Super League.

Team sources later claimed James was too tired to talk, but the Blasters dressing-room are also aware that all is not well back in the UK following his decision to auction his belongings on the web.

The former England goalkeeper has been forced into auctioning signed shirts, shorts and match balls after being declared bankrupt in May. James is also selling more unusual items such as a van, a chopper bicycle and a jubilee mug to raise cash.

James has built up crippling debts after breaking up with his wife Tanya in 2005 and is said to have blown his £20million fortune which came from his football wages, endorsements and modelling contracts for companies such as Armani.

The 44-year-old played in the Premier League for teams such as Liverpool, Manchester City and Portsmouth and has recently came out of retirement to become a player-manager with the Blasters.

Until the revelations, no-one inside the James circle was aware of the desperate financial situation that forced him to Hertford County Court.

James’s mood picked up a little on Thursday evening, when his team beat local rivals FC Goa 1-0 in front of 47,000 fans at the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium in Cochin. That lifted them up to fifth in the eight-team league after a difficult start to the season, though the atmosphere at the game was better than the football.

After a stint in Iceland, James is trying to forge a new career in another unlikely setting. The surreal nature of his Indian odyssey is underlined by the fact that the club’s co-owner is former cricket legend Sachin Tendulkar, who drew cheers louder than anything the footballers could attract whenever he appeared on the big screen during Thursday’s game.

In one of the few parts of India where football can even begin to rival cricket, the pressure is on James to live up to his status as the Blasters’ ‘marquee’ player. Billboards in and out of Cochin proclaim ‘God’s Own Team’ and ‘Football’s Own Country’, and he elicited a cheer every time he touched the ball against Goa.

But he also showed signs of impatience with aspects of his team’s defending, flapping his hands in frustration on several occasions when his colleagues failed to deal with a free-kick or a corner.

The final whistle brought relief, and hugs all round, but the expectations are not going away: Kerala Blasters host Delhi Dynamos on Sunday knowing that their passionate fans will be clamouring for another win.
