Sunderland head coach Gus Poyet has distanced himself from the club’s recruitment policy and denounced the lack of quality in his side.

The Uruguayan’s latest dig at the club hierarchy — led by sporting director Lee Congerton — comes just days before the Tyne-Wear derby.

After five draws from their last six matches, Poyet has confessed that he does not enjoy watching the team play. And he insists that the responsibility for bringing in players to lift the ‘boredom’ is not in his remit.

‘You know what is missing (from the team) — it is clear what we need to do,’ he said. ‘That is down to recruitment. I am a head coach. I am not going to be a head coach when it suits people and a manager when it doesn’t. That side of it is down to recruitment.

‘So, if you ever get the chance to speak to anyone on the recruitment side and ask them about it (signing players), you are lucky. If you don’t, don’t ask me.

‘If we don’t get more quality there is going to be more games like that (Saturday’s 1-1 draw with West Ham). It will be 38 games and 38 points. If we lose two or three everyone will start panicking and having heart attacks.’

The Black Cats are 15th in the Premier League, two points above the relegation zone. They have won just twice all season and have 10 draws — including five 0-0s.

‘We are passing the ball as well as we can, given the quality of our players,’ Poyet added. ‘When we get into the last third the delivery needs to be better. That is quality. The finishing needs to be better. That is quality. Heading needs to be better. That is quality.

‘The shot needs to be in the right time. Maybe take a touch and make space before shooting. Hit the target, not a body in front of you. That is about quality. I want more quality. Do I think I’ll get it? I don’t know.’

Poyet wants to make a renewed approach for former loanee Fabio Borini. Liverpool accepted a £14million bid during the summer but the Italian forward chose to remain at Anfield. Sunderland’s transfer team, however, do not want to go back in for Borini and that could further upset the head coach.

Poyet, when asked when he will replace his misfiring strikers, said: ‘When I have got another one.

‘I would love to play with wingers and two strikers. Our wingers have got some ability, they can do certain things, but they cannot defend or run the quantity they need to run.’
