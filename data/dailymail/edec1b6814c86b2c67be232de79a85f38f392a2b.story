Snow will fall in Britain  as early as next week as temperatures plummet to below freezing, forecasters warned last night.

The coldest weather of the year so far is set to hit swathes of the country as Arctic winds bring flurries of snow and widespread frost.

By Tuesday, large parts of the UK could see wintry showers with the chance of some significant snowfall on higher ground.

But snow is more likely along coastal regions and the northern parts of England and Scotland, the Met Office said.

Forecaster Dan Williams said: ‘On Tuesday morning some people could wake up to see snow falling – but it won’t last for long. There could be some slushy snow in places – possibly where showers get organised.

‘There will be more persistent snow showers along coastal areas. There could be accumulations of snow on higher ground and in some coastal areas it could settle.’

Temperatures over the weekend will be as high as 12C (54F), with clear weather expected in the South East.

But it could be gloomy for those in the north, with cloud predicted for much of the day  on Saturday.

There will be a significant drop in temperatures overnight on Monday as the mercury falls as low as -4C (25F) in northern England and -3C (27F) in some parts of southern England. Those in Scotland should be braced for temperatures as low as -5C (23F).

The average temperature for Britain in November is 9C but daytime temperatures will be dropping to as low as 5C in some parts of the country next week.

Forecasters are warning people to be prepared for a cold snap.

A forecaster at Meteogroup said much of the UK could be covered in a ‘nice and pretty’ light dusting of snow as it gets ‘noticeably colder’.

Experts do not expect the snow to cause any disruption and believe temperatures will climb again by next weekend.

Rachel Vince said the cold snap and risk of snow will be caused by air coming down from the Arctic, and the areas at risk of snow are Scotland, the east coast of England, west Wales, south-west England and Northern Ireland.

She described next week’s  cold weather as ‘brief’, and  said temperatures are expected to return to normal towards  the weekend.

Snow has already fallen on higher ground in Scotland but next week up to four inches could fall in the Cairngorms.

The Met Office stressed that it was ‘not unusual to see snow in late November and early December’ and temperatures were only a couple of degrees lower than average for this time of year.

But a spokesman said next week’s snow flurries appear to be ‘a blip’. 

Forecaster Charles Powell, from the Met Office, said the country would be getting noticeably colder and people should be prepared for snowfall and frosty mornings.

He said: 'Snowfall will mainly be for northerly and north west Scotland, probably drifting as far south as north west England, south west England across the moors.

'The main thing people will notice is the drop in temperature below average.'

Sainsburys expect a 200 per cent increase in sales of snow shovels and are anticipating selling 23,000 cans of de-icer in the coming week.

Customers will be preparing for the potentially icy conditions and buying more than 170,000 packets of salt.Sainsbury’s is anticipating its customers to stock up on traditional winter warmer foods and expects to sell 2.5million tins of soup, 400,000 cartons of hot chocolate and 420,000 packets of hot cereals.

The Local Government Association announced that councils across England and Wales have been replenishing grit supplies in preparation for wintry weather.

Cambridgeshire alone has 10,000 tons of salt stockpiled, with a further 6,000 tons held in reserve to keep traffic moving during an icy spell strike.
