The mayor of an Alabama town has been arrested for multiple sex crimes, including sexual abuse, sexual misconduct, harassment and soliciting prostitution.Â 

Carbon Hill Mayor James 'PeeWee' Richardson was handcuffed and taken to the Walker County Jail by agents with the Alabama Attorney General's office Thursday night, WBRC-TV reported.

Walker County Jail records show that Richardson was booked on a total of 11 charges. They include four counts of first-degree sexual abuse; four counts of custodial sexual misconduct, two counts of harassment and one count of soliciting a prostitute.

As he was being led into jail, he was asked by a reporter if the charges were true and he said they were not. He declined to comment further.

'Specifically, the indictment charges that Richardson subjected four separate victims to sexual contact by forcible compulsion and also that he engaged in sexual conduct with some of the victims while they were in the custody of the Carbon Hill City Jail,' Alabama Attorney General Luther Strange said in a statement Friday.

'Additionally, Richardson is charged with soliciting prostitution from one of these four victims,' Strange added. 'The harassment counts involve acts against two different female victims.'

If convicted, he faces a maximum penalty of one to 10 years for each count of first-degree sexual abuse and for each count of custodial sexual misconduct, plus lesser sentences for the other charges.

Richardson was being held on bonds totaling $250,000, WBMA-TV reported.
