A 17-year-old boy who is an openly gay teenager has said he was forced to change schools after being given an ultimatum by the his principal to delete his YouTube videos in which he is seen with his boyfriend. 

Austin Wallis was told to find another school by his principal at Lutheran High North school in Houston.

He was summoned into the office and given an ultimatum: delete the videos or leave the school.

Devastated: A gay teenager claims he was forced to leave his high school after they gave him an ultimatum — either go back in the closet or find a new school

In tears: In his latest video Austin Wallis apologizes for the tears, stating 'this was an emotional video,' and adds, '…things like this should not be allowed in our country

'He said that in the Bible, it declares that being a homosexual is a sin and we cannot have you promoting a sinful lifestyle,' said Austin to LGBTQ Nation. 

'I realized that I don't want to be somewhere where I can be kicked out for being gay and being open about it.' 

Although the private school has the legal ability to decide who should be allowed to attend, Austin is querying whether the school's actions are indeed moral or ethical.

Austin first came out in a YouTube post last August, and since then regularly vlogs about topics affecting gay youth, and activities and adventures with his boyfriend.

Rules are rules: Disputing his account, the school's head, Dallas Lusk (pictured), said the school had a 'right' to expel gay students

Wallis said in a video on the situation: 'The gist of it was: I had to go back into the closet. Which means I had to delete all my social media, including YouTube. I had to erase my digital impact on the world. And he said I'll have to do that to stay at the school.'

'I think it's ridiculous that in this day and age you can be excluded from your own school for being gay,' he said to Pink News.

'When I came out I knew I was going to have bullies, and I knew people were not going to be OK with it. But I never expected it to be from the people who were supposed to protect you from the bullies.'

He has since decided to leave Lutheran High North. 

In an emotional video posted last week, Wallis tearfully explained that he chose to leave rather than hide who he was.

 'I had to leave all my friends, and all my teachers, and I don't want people to think I left just because of the social media,' he said.

'It was because I can't stay somewhere where I feel like I'm being forced into something that I'm not and where I feel like I'm not wanted by my own principal and head of the board. 

School policy: Lutheran High North reserves the right to discontinue a  student participating in, promoting, supporting or condoning: sexual immorality, homosexual activity or bisexual activity; or displaying resistance to support the qualities and characteristics required of a Biblically based and Christ-like lifestyle

Candy crush: The principal allegedly told Wallis that he had to go back in the closet, and remove all of his social media accounts, including the YouTube channel

School officials are not commenting on Austin's allegations, butpointed to a 'morals clause' in its student handbook.

 In a statement issued by the Lutheran Education Association of Houston, executive director Wayne Kramer said, 'We respectfully require students to adhere to these accepted values and moral beliefs.'

'Students have to make choices and decide whether their beliefs align with our community,' Mr Kramer said. 

Austin's family says they do not plan on taking any legal action against the school.
