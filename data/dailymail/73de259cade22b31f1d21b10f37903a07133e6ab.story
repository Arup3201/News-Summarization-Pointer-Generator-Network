Staff on P&O cruise ships paid just 75p an hour are having their tips withheld unless they reach certain performance targets, it was reported today.

In a move designed to make crew 'more responsive', staff are having their bonuses cut unless their work matches pre-agreed customer feedback ratings, some of which are more than 96 per cent.

The extreme end of the scale sees junior waiters on a cruise from Southampton earning just £250 a month, with a possible £150 in bonuses, according to the Guardian.

Pay package: Crewmembers on P&O ships will have their bonuses withheld unless they meet certain performance targets

Documents seen by the newspaper claim this pay, for 11-hour shifts, seven days a week, represents a 'significantly increased basic salary'.

David Dingle, CEO of Carnival UK, the firm in charge of P&O cruises, told the Guardian that customers were 'reluctant to pay the recommended level of tipping', claiming the move had made crew 'much happier.'

He said: 'You've got staff from eastern Europe in restaurants in Britain – why? Because it's great money.

'Yes, the minimum wage is more than we pay, but this is a global industry, Our businesses have to remain competitive.

P&O boss DAvid Dingle defended the pay move, saying it has made crew 'much happier'

'Let's not forget the level of take-home pay for our staff, the vast majority of whom come from India. Look at hotels in Goa. The earning ability is greater on our ships.'

Many restaurants have already phased out cash tipping in favour of electronic tips which are automatically added to customers' bills.

However, P&O bosses have opted to remove the risk of tips not being paid by paying bonuses if targets are met.

Mr Dingle said the new measures have 
been handled 'fairly and decently' to make sure staff pay is protected, 
but the move is likely to attract criticism for the treatment of already
low-earning crewmembers.

The new system will see bonus payments withheld if performances do not match certain customer feedback ratings.

For
example, cabin stewards whose work performance does not match a 92 per 
cent approval rating ave bonuses worth 15 per cent of their salary held 
back.
