The armed auto thieves have become so common that parts of the bankrupt metropolis are referred to as 'Carjack City,' and many motorists fear getting out of their vehicles even for a few moments to fill a tank.

So gas stations are taking steps to protect customers, and the city has formed a special police team to go after suspects. Convicted carjackers will even get their faces and prison sentences plastered onto billboards.

Mousa Bazzi, who owns a Mobil station in a semi-desolate neighborhood bordering Detroit's east riverfront, is seen inside his station. Bazzi's station displays pale-green decals depicting a lighthouse -- a symbol that his business has joined the city's anti-carjacking effort

A decal highlighting shelter, safety and assistance is displayed on the front door of Mousa Bazzi's Mobil station, which has joined the city's anti-carjacking effort. To be part of the program, stations must have working security cameras, good lighting, be open 24 hours and have clerks willing to help motorists and provide a phone for emergency calls

You need to catch these people and 
make a good example of them,' said Mousa Bazzi, who owns a Mobil station
 in a semi-desolate neighborhood bordering Detroit's east riverfront. He
 keeps his business well-lit and continually has two to four employees 
inside to ensure 'there's always an extra hand or two' in case of 
trouble.

Authorities blame 
many of the carjackings, ironically, on improvements in vehicle 
security. Anti-theft equipment, GPS systems and advanced locks now 
prevent many vehicles from being driven without a key in the ignition.

That
 makes it difficult or impossible for thieves to steal parked cars, 
leading them to target vehicles that are occupied, said Jonathan 
Parnell, of Detroit's auto-theft squad.

Also contributing to the thefts is a strong demand for stolen wheels and tires, police said.

Through May 19, Detroit has recorded 191 carjackings in 2014. In 2013, it had 720, considered a high number given Detroit's population of 700,000

 station displays pale-green decals depicting a lighthouse â€” a sign that
 his business has joined the city's anti-carjacking effort. To be part 
of the program, stations must have security cameras, good lighting, be 
open 24 hours and have clerks willing to help motorists and provide a 
phone for emergency calls.

'There
 is a waiting list,' Sergeant Michael Woody said. 'We have so many gas 
stations that want to become a lighthouse. You get better protection 
with that big sticker in the window that tells criminals there is proper
 equipment that will help police investigate these crimes.'

Through May 19, Detroit has recorded 191 carjackings in 2014. Detroit
 police reported 720 carjackings last year in the city of fewer than 
700,000 people. That's down from nearly 850 in 2011 and 1,231 in 2008.

The
 decline may partly be due to Detroit's freefalling population, but the 
thefts still exceed the carjackings in some comparably sized U.S. 
cities.

Sharlonda Buckman, 
executive director of a Detroit nonprofit, was at a gas station on an 
October morning when she ran inside for aspirin. Back inside her SUV, 
she was just closing the door when she saw a carjacker shove his gun 
inside.

She screamed and 
jumped out of the vehicle. The carjacker jumped in and drove off. Three 
other customers gave chase in their vehicles. One caught up to the SUV 
and got shot in the leg by the carjacker, who was later arrested.

In a photo shot from video provided by the Detroit police, car thieves take the tires off a Ford Fusion. Detroit has actually seen a decrease in carjackings between 2011 and 2013, but it could be the result of many people moving out of the city

Now, Buckman said, she tries not to pump gas at all.

'If the night catches me, I won't pump gas in the city,' she said. 'Or I'll call somebody to meet me.'

It's
 difficult to know how Detroit's carjackings rank nationally because 
many police agencies lump carjackings with all armed robberies in annual
 reports to the FBI.

Newark,
 New Jersey, with a population of 280,000, had 382 carjackings last 
year, giving it a per capita rate that is actually higher than 
Detroit's. Memphis, Tennessee, with a population of 655,000, had 
slightly more than 400 carjackings over three years from 2011 through 
2013. El Paso, a rapidly growing western Texas city of 670,000, reported
 only 15 carjackings last year and 18 in 2012.

Through
 May 19, Detroit has recorded 191 carjackings in 2014, including the 
Feb. 24 shooting death of CVS security guard Courtney Meeks, who rushed 
toward a car being taken by three men, and the Feb. 4 slaying of Donald 
Bradshaw, a 68-year-old man who was beaten to death with a tire iron 
after he was carjacked at an intersection.

Prosecutors,
 the FBI and Detroit police recently announced a campaign to spread the 
word about stiffer federal penalties for carjacking, which can include 
the death penalty if someone is killed. A similar campaign that includes
 billboards with photos of convicted carjackers started last summer in 
Newark.

Detroit police have 
also announced a partnership with General Motors' OnStar roadside 
assistance service to track down stolen vehicles and promote rewards 
tied to an anonymous tip line.

To avoid becoming a victim, security guard Greg Champion wears a handgun on his hip whenever he's pumping gas.

'I
 don't want to surprise you,' Champion said. 'I want you to know I'm 
armed, and I want you to know I can defend myself, and I want you to go 
somewhere else.'

Christine 
Reed takes the opposite approach. The 27-year-old mother of two won't 
stop for gas in Detroit. She lives north of the city in Warren and works
 four days a week cleaning offices downtown.

If she's in a bad section of town, Reed said, she passes through red lights because it's tougher to carjack a moving target.

'It's not a safe place anymore,' Reed said. 'It's dangerous.'

The
 state-appointed emergency manager tasked with restructuring Detroit's 
$18 billion in debt has said crime needs to be reduced to make the city 
attractive to new residents and businesses.

That's
 going to take more and better resources, said Wayne County Prosecutor 
Kym Worthy, who complains that she has only a few assistants to try 
carjackings.

'When nobody has any resources ... all we can be is reactive,' she said.
