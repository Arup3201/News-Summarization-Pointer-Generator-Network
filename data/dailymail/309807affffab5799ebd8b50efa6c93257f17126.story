Normally drivers dread having to pay motoring fines, but little Za'Dariyah Mishaw cannot wait to go to her local police department to hand over her $4.

The two-year-old girl was driving her small pedal car outside her Florida apartment complex when a police cruiser pulled into the car park with its blue lights flashing.

During a heartwarming moment, Officer Christian Velasco took out his citation book and handed little Za'Dariyah a ticket.

Officer Velasco and his colleagues were patrolling the area in search of a criminal suspect when they saw little Za'Dariyah playing.

He said: 'She was going pretty fast. It took me a while to catch up to her, but we did, and she was cited.'

The traffic stop was captured by Za'Dariyah's uncle Keyth Mishaw who was watching his niece play.

He said: 'Everyone always has bad things to say about the Jacksonville Sheriff's Office, well I want to say "big props" to these officers for making a memorable moment for my family.

'It was fun moment, brightened up the whole day.'
