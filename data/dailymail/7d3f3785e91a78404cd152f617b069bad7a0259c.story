Samsung has overtaken Apple to become the world’s most profitable mobile phone company.

Apple’s share of the smartphone market dropped to 14 per cent, its lowest for three years, because of ‘lacklustre’ iPhone 5 sales and tougher competition from rivals, according to industry analysts.

Driven by demand for cheaper Android devices in Asia and Latin America, Samsung’s handset  division made an estimated £3.4billion operating profit in the second quarter of this year.

The South Korea-based electronics 
giant, also the world’s biggest TV company, made 27.7 per cent of all 
phones sold during the quarter.

Apple’s iPhone was said to be 
‘underperforming’ with an estimated operating profit of £3billion 
according to research firm Strategy Analytics.

In the past, while selling fewer phones, the more expensive iPhone has kept Apple’s profits ahead of competitors’.

But with no new products to do battle with Samsung’s latest, the Galaxy S4, Apple finally lost its crown.

Neil Shah, of Strategy Analytics, 
said: ‘With strong volumes, high wholesale prices and tight cost 
controls, Samsung has finally succeeded in becoming the handset 
industry’s largest and most profitable vendor.’

Experts say Apple could overtake Samsung again when it launches its next iPhone model.

Apple released its most recent handset, the iPhone 5, pictured, in September 2012 whereas Samsung released its flagship Galaxy S4 in March. Since then the Korean firm has also released the Samsung Galaxy S4 Mini in May - both which would have contributed to the company's lead

Budget smartphone maker ZTE, which makes the PF200, pictured, is now the world's fourth largest manufacturer for the first time ever

Both companies storm ahead of other phone makers, including LG, Lenovo and ZTE which had 5.1 per cent share, 4.7 per cent and 4.2 per cent respectively.

This is the first time ever that ZTE has taken the fourth spot.

Lenovo pushed Huawei from the list.

However, some analysts claim this might be because Apple is gearing up for a new release so is experiencing a natural decline. 

Apple released its most recent handset, the iPhone 5, in September 2012 whereas Samsung released its flagship Galaxy S4 in March this year.

Since that time, the Korean firm has also released the Samsung Galaxy S4 Mini in May - both which would have contributed to this rise.

Apple is rumoured to be working on an iPhone 5S, due to launch in September, as well as a cheaper, plastic model dubbed iPhone Lite.

Figures from uSwitch.com's Mobile Tracker for July found that Apple handsets are still among the bestselling smartphones in the UK.

Apple's
 iPhone 5 topped the list, followed by the 4S model.

Samsung's Galaxy S4
 is the bestselling Android device while Apple's iPhone 4 is in fourth 
place and Samsung's other Galaxy handsets occupy fifth, eight, ninth and
 tenth place.

The HTC One Silver and Sony's Xperia Z complete the top ten in sixth and seventh respectively.

Other
 figures from Strategy Analystics found that global smartphone shipments
 grew 47 per cent annually from 156.5 million units in the second 
quarter of 2012 to 229.6 million in Q2 2013.

This was the largest volume of smartphones ever shipped in a single quarter.

Smartphones
 accounted for 59 per cent of all mobile phones shipped globally and the
 growth is being driven by surging demand for 4G models in developed 
regions like the U.S and 3G models in emerging markets such as India.
