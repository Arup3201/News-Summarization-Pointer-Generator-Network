Police allege Reni Maitua was fueled by alcohol when he assaulted taxi driver last year

NRL star Reni Maitua was intoxicated the night  he swore at a Sydney taxi driver before punching, kicking and hitting him with a tree branch, a court has heard.

Maitua, 32, has pleaded not guilty to one count of common assault and one of intimidation following the alleged incident in November last year. The Canterbury Bulldogs player, who was banned form the NRL in 2009 for taking a banned substance, is applying for the matter to be discharged under Section 32 of the Mental Health Act.

But police have alleged it was alcohol, and not depression, which fueled his aggressive behaviour. During his taxi fare police said Maitua swore at a taxi driver before punching, kicking and attacking him with a branch.

Prosecutor Rick Mansley told the Downing Centre Local court that Maitua rejected suggestions that his mental health played a part in the attack and said he exhibited these aggressive traits because he was drunk: 'It is clear that when the accused isn't intoxicated to the level he was on this occasion, these sorts of incidents don't occur.'

His lawyer, defence barrister Murugan Thangaraj, told Downing Centre Local Court that Maitua was having a depressive episode when he got into the taxi, and revealed personal details about how the troubled NRL player had attempted to commit suicide just three months prior.

Mr Thangaraj said the dumped Cronulla Shark forward, who was given another chance at the Bulldogs where his career begun, had shown positive signs of rehabilitation.

Reni Maitua was dumped by Canterbury in 2008 but is back playing for the club he won a premiership with in 2005 

'This year, despite his injury, despite his surgery and despite his mental health issues he is in first grade at a club that is higher up the ladder than the one that didn't want him anymore.'

While police allege Maitua delivered a barrage of punches and kicks, Mr Thangaraj argued that CCTV footage revealed the backrower may have just given the driver an 'open-handed push'.

Maitua was suspended by the Bulldogs after he was charged over the assault but he was reinstated after one month on strict conditions, including that he agree to an alcohol ban.

Controversy has never been far from the one-time Australian representative whose playing career began to unravel in 2006 when he lost his license for drink driving.

The former Test lock was also sacked by his current club back in 2008, after turning up late several times to training.

In 2009 he tested positive to the banned substance Clenbuterol, a stimulant used to boost muscle mass.  He maintained his innocence at the time, but it later emerged he was a recreational drug user and that may have been what lead to his positive test.

He returned to be with the Bulldogs this year on a one-year contract and told the ABC he was excited to be be back where his first grade career began. 'I'm really grateful for the opportunity and it'll be great to finish off my career where it all started,' he said.

The hearing continues.
