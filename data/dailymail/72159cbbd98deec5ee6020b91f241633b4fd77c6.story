'Liverpool Football Club exists to win trophies' proclaimed the legendary Bill Shankly, and so far every manager at Anfield in the last 50 years has followed the mantra and collected silverware – except the unpopular Roy Hodgson.

To avoid remaining a second member of the very exclusive and unwanted club, Brendan Rodgers must beat Bournemouth in the Capital One Cup on Wednesday night, which will take his club into the semi-finals and within reaching distance of that elusive cup.

For all his good work at Anfield, Rodgers has not been able to show off something tangible on a lap of honour. Even taking into account football's fickle nature, the fall in his stock has been remarkable.

Less than eight months ago comparisons with Shankly himself were being made as Rodgers took Liverpool within touching distance of their first league title for 24 years.

But since then Luis Suarez has left, Daniel Sturridge been injured, Raheem Sterling stopped scoring, Simon Mignolet made errors and Steven Gerrard slipped.

To fill the gaps, Rodgers signed nine players at a cost of £117million, none of whom have been a success, particularly strikers Mario Balotelli and Rickie Lambert.

Raheem Sterling is another player suffering this season, and the forward has not scored for 21 games

There are unresolved contract issues over Sterling, Gerrard, Glen Johnson and Jordan Henderson and no words of encouragement for the manager from owner John W Henry just a few months after he handed the Ulsterman a new long-term contract.

Rodgers knows that more than at any other club Liverpool fans judge their managers by trophies.

Shankly got the ball rolling in a style that fulfilled his wish to 'make the people happy'.

His successor Bob Paisley took domestic dominance into Europe and became the first manager to win the European Cup three times.

Joe Fagan then won three trophies in one season – something even Shankly and Paisley hadn't managed.

As player-manager, Kenny Dalglish then won the club's first league and FA Cup double, in 1986.

In recent times Liverpool have been surpassed by Manchester United as the country's top team. But it hasn't stopped their managers from collecting silverware altogether.

Graeme Souness won the FA Cup in 1992 with a young Steve McManaman to the fore; Roy Evans' side collected the 1995 League Cup; Gerard Houllier delivered a cup treble in 2001; Rafa Benitez unforgettably won the Champions League in Istanbul; and Dalglish won the League Cup at Wembley in his only full season in charge second time around.

The one exception was Hodgson, sacked after six dismal months in January 2011.

Rodgers is certainly regarded with far more respect than Hodgson and his achievements at the club are impressive. But it will mean little or nothing in Liverpool's illustrious history without a trophy to show for it.

'I want a trophy this year,' said Rodgers on the club's pre-season tour of America. With the Champions League gone and Premier League very, very unlikely, this is his best chance.

It won't be easy of course. Bournemouth are tipped to win promotion to the top-flight this season under their bright young manager Eddie Howe and have improved rapidly since January, when Liverpool won an FA Cup fourth round tie 2-0 at Dean Court.

But while Bournemouth are better than at the start of 2014, Liverpool's form suggests they are not.

Their two goalscorers that day aren't available now, with Victor Moses at Stoke City and Sturridge out of action since August with a variety of muscular injuries.

It is time for others to step up,  Lambert perhaps, or Sterling, who has gone 21 games without a goal for club and country.

'Liverpool are still the overwhelming favourites,' said Bournemouth skipper Tommy Elphick.

Rodgers better hope they start playing like favourites. In its own way, this match is as important as the recent Basle and Manchester United games. 

The man who polishes cups at Anfield is beginning to feel redundant.
