Snack: The popular burger is on McDonald's $1 and More menu list and Hill's wife alleged bought one for him prompting his temper tantrum

Hill is then alleged to have followed his wife to the bathroom where she had gone to clean herself up and then shoved the bun into her face.

When officers arrived at his home when his wife called 911, Hill claimed that his wife assaulted him, but found mayonaise on her shirt and face when they went to speak to her.

They saw that her nose was swollen and despite Hill trying to show them cellphone footage of his encounter, they arrested him and charged him with simple domestic assault.

According to the Des Moines Register, after viewing the video, officers believed that Hill was trying to engineer another fight with his wife to make her seem the aggressor.

Hill is currently being held in Polk County Jail without bond.
