Craig Stewart, 31, admitted three charges of possessing a knife at the village hall in Llandderfel

A birthday party guest threatened another man with a knife – after he was accused of eating too much sage and onion stuffing.

Craig Peter Stewart, 31, felt ‘insulted’ by a fellow guest as he helped himself to food from a buffet table at the village hall in Llandderfel in Gwynedd, Wales, a court heard.

He walked the 200 yards to his home and changed into different clothes before picking up three knives – a 5inch kitchen knife, a 3inch paring knife and a large bread knife - and headed back to the party.

Dolgellau magistrates heard that he ‘brandished the knife in a threatening manner’ and was ‘making threats with the knife’ towards the man he said had ‘insulted’ him.

Magistrates were told the group of partygoers were left ‘absolutely terrified’.

‘All the witnesses say they believed the defendant was going to use the knife’ and were ‘scared for their safety,’ the court heard.

Police were called to the hall just after 2am on August 24 and found Stewart being restrained by two of the revellers.

When officers searched him they found two of the knives nearby and another tucked in the waistband of his trousers.

In defence, the court heard that Stewart had returned to the party with the knives as he ‘wanted more food’ and there was ‘no cutlery on the buffet table’.

The court also heard that he had decided to change his clothes because he was ‘freezing’.

Prosecutors, however, labelled his version of events ‘fantastical’.

While the court heard that Stewart is ‘distraught’ at his actions and that it was a ‘one-off incident’, new guidelines  mean that anyone convicted of a knife-related crime now faces a stiff penalty.

Stewart, of Llandderfel, Gwynedd, pleaded guilty to three charges of possessing a knife when he appeared before magistrates on Thursday, October 16.

He is due to be sentenced at Caernarfon Crown Court on Thursday November 6 after Dolgellau magistrates ruled that they were unable to impose a sufficiently tough sentence.

He was released on conditional bail until the hearing.
