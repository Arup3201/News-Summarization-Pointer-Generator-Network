Attacker: Jay Soso was jailed for more than 12 years after he raped and killed Marie Reid in her sheltered home in Edinburgh

A young man was today jailed for more than 12 years for raping and killing a frail woman in her sheltered home.

Jay Soso was only 18 when he attacked 63-year-old Marie Reid, who had lived next door to him and treated him 'like a grandson'.

Mrs Reid was found dead in blood-stained nightclothes, lying on a sofa in her Edinburgh flat, after neighbours became worried when they had not seen her for days.

Police initially thought her death was not suspicious, but the truth emerged after her family voiced concerns and post-mortem examinations were carried out.

Soso, now 20, was sentenced at the High Court in Edinburgh today after pleading guilty at a previous hearing to rape and culpable homicide.

He has no previous convictions.

He was given an extended sentence, detaining him for 12 years and eight months, and a judge ordered for him to be supervised for a further five years on his release.

The court heard that Mrs Reid was particularly vulnerable as she suffered from a number of significant medical issues and her health was more like that of an 80-year-old.

When neighbours raised concerns after they had not seen her, housing support officers entered her home in Easter Drylaw Way on November 15, 2010, and found her dead in the lounge.

Post-mortem examinations of Mrs Reid's body revealed that she had been raped four days earlier and had died on the day of the attack.

Soso's DNA matched samples taken from the scene.

He was originally charged with murder, but his plea of guilty to a reduced charge was accepted.

Soso and his mother used to live next door to Mrs Reid, who treated him kindly.

In
early 2008, he and his family moved to Hartlepool, County Durham, but 
he returned to Edinburgh by June that year and eventually got a flat in 
the Drylaw area.

Victim: Marie Reid, pictured with her son Paul, was found dead in blood-stained bedclothes in her lounge

At the time of the attack, he was single and worked locally as a fishmonger.

Outside
court, Mrs Reid's son Paul, 31, revealed how he persuaded police to 
carry out a criminal investigation into his mother's death.

'I
noticed something funny when I first went to the home,' he said. 'There
was something strange about it, I couldn’t put my finger on it.

'I went to the police station and said "I want you to look at this further because there’s something not right".'

Mr Reid said he had struggled to come to terms with losing his 'sweet and loveable' mother in such horrific circumstances.

He said she had 'a big heart' and would do anything for people in her local community.

'I just hope it never happens to anybody,' he added. 'It’s hard to cope with, I’m struggling myself in life now.

'Losing my mum has been so hard. I’ve got so much anger towards Jay just now.

'I knew Jay since he was maybe eight or nine. I couldn’t believe that Jay would do such a thing like this, he didn’t seem the type. My mum treated him like a grandson.'

Mr Reid, who was accompanied by his sister, Jacqueline Sanderson, 38, said Soso even offered his condolences to the family shortly after Mrs Reid's body was found.

'Now for me, knowing that he shook my hand and gave me condolences, that makes me even more angry towards him,' he said.

Mrs Sanderson's husband Gordon, 54, of North Berwick, East Lothian, said the family was content with Soso's sentence.

'The way I see it now, he’s away and other women in the same situation are going to be safe from him,' Mr Sanderson said. 'He’s off the streets and the public’s safe.

'Marie was so quiet, friendly and trusted people. She didn’t deserve to go the way she did.

'To die the way she did, being left alone in that place for five days, is just horrible.

'We can’t fathom what he was thinking to have actually done it. He must have snapped somewhere.'

Passing sentence, judge Lady Dorrian said: 'You have pled guilty to the rape and culpable homicide of an elderly lady in her own home.

'She was vulnerable in that she lived alone and suffered from poor health, both factors of which you were aware.

'You knew her and there was an element of trust in the relationship you had with her.'

Brian McConnachie QC, defending, said Soso accepted full responsibility for what happened, although he continued to insist he cannot remember the attack.

The lawyer said Soso had smoked cannabis since he was a young teenager, but there was nothing in his past behaviour to suggest he would commit such a crime.

'It is almost incapable of explanation as to how this offence came about,' he said. 'It is a tragic case in so many ways for Marie and for her family.

'Her untimely death has undoubtedly affected them and clearly they will have to live with the consequences of this act forever.'
