A leading cancer specialist was today cleared of killing a 21-year-old cyclist while driving on the wrong side of the road.

Dr Helen Measures wept as jurors delivered their 'not guilty' verdict after just over three hours of deliberations.

She had been trying to overtake two other cyclists in her red Mini but collided with waitress Denisa Perinova, who was on a bike ride with her new boyfriend.

The 21-year-old, originally from Czech Republic, lost control after partner Ben Pontin, ahead of her, slowed to avoid the car, Oxford Crown Court was told.

Riding the bike Mr Pontin had bought her four days before, she was flung 15 yards away and, despite wearing a helmet, died in hospital from severe head injuries a week later.

Dr Measures denied a single charge of causing death by careless driving in relation to the incident on July 15 last year.

The divorced mother-of-four was travelling back from visiting a garden centre, driving at 40-50mph, with her four-year-old daughter and boyfriend when the tragedy unfolded near to her home in Henley-on-Thames.

With a doctorate in oncology, she has worked as a scientist for leading pharmaceutical companies for the past 30 years.

The former parish church bell ringer said she was 'surprised' to see Mr Pontin and his girlfriend suddenly emerge coming towards her as she rounded the curve in the road - but felt they still had enough room to get past.

'I had to make a decision of what to do,' she said.

'I felt the safest decision was to continue straight ahead because they were in single file.

'If I had been concerned, I would have stopped suddenly.'

A keen cyclist herself, she told the court: 'I can’t help it if a cyclist, with all due respect, falls over as I’m approaching them and comes into my line of travel.'

Victim: Miss Perinova, here with her parents and younger brother, died after losing control of her new bike

The first cyclist, Mr Pontin, went past her.

However, Miss Perinova came at her at a 'right angle' after losing control of her bike.

It was unclear whether the young Czech woman had actually been struck by the defendant’s Mini but the other pair of cyclists claim they heard an impact.

Miss Perinova fell into the road then came to rest with her head on the edge of a field and her legs sticking out onto the tarmac.

Her body lay motionless, her helmet was smashed.

Not guilty: Judge Patrick Eccles told a tearful Dr Measures to leave the dock after a jury returned their verdict

She was initially rushed to the Royal Berkshire Hospital in Reading before being transferred to a specialist neurological unit at the John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford, where she later died.

Mr Pontin had earlier told the jury he saw Dr Measures make a 'stupid manoeuvre' in front of them on a bend in the A415.

Describing the moment the oncoming car overtook the cyclists on the opposite side of the road, he said: 'I just couldn’t believe the person driving had overtaken at that point.'

Mr Pontin said he was forced to aim for a 'tiny' gap and then felt his girlfriend’s wheel touch the back of his bike before looking around and seeing she had been flung away in the collision.

Judge Patrick Eccles told an emotional Dr Measures she could leave, cleared, after the verdict was returned.
