In an ancient manuscript dating back more than 800 years, a historian has discovered what is believed to be designs for the first ever robot.

The Book of Knowledge of Ingenious Mechanical Devices was written around 1206 and features a total of 174 automated and mechanical drawings.

Using these ancient drawings, historian Bert Hall has now successfully managed to recreate one of these designs called ‘the 'hand-washing automaton.'

The Book of Knowledge of Ingenious Mechanical Devices dates back to around 1206 and features 174 automated and mechanical drawings. Using these ancient drawings, historian Bert Hall has successfully managed to recreate one of these designs called the 'hand-washing automaton,' pictured

Al-Jazari was a Muslim polymath who lived during the Islamic Golden Age.

He was a mechanical engineer and mathematician and designed various systems all powered by the flow and movement of water.

Many of these designs featured in his 13th century manuscripts, including The Book of Knowledge of Ingenious Mechanical Devices.

The book features fifty mechanical devices and systems, grouped into six chapters.

The devices
 include water and candle clocks, pitchers and basins for phlebotomy and
 cleansing before prayers, shape-changing fountains, machines powered by
 water and vessels for drinking.

Each
 device is called a ‘shakl’ and is depicted by graphical drawings and 
simple annotations that explain how each shakl would work.

This automaton is a water-powered system that helps the user wash their hands.

Once the water stops running, a cut-out figure presents the user with a towel.

According to a video on the Smithsonian Channel, Hall enlisted the help of Chris Warrilow, a designer from Toronto, to create the device and demonstrated that it works effectively.

Hall got the idea after researching the work of Iraqi inventor al-Jazari.

The original 'hand-washing automaton' design by al-Jazeri that features in his 1206 manuscript

The devices include water and candle clocks, pitchers and basins for phlebotomy and cleansing before prayers, shape-changing fountains, machines powered by water and vessels for drinking.

Each device is called a ‘shakl’ and is depicted by graphical drawings and simple annotations that explain how each shakl would work.

Complicated devices were broken down into more detailed drawings, with various components highlighted.

Al-Jazari included a total of 174 drawings in the manuscript, each with instructions on how to build them, with various parts highlighted using different letters of the Arabic alphabet – similar to how flat pack furniture manuals are presented. 

Other al-Jazari designs include a musical
 robot band, also called ‘a musical automaton’, which featured four 
musicians on a boat that floated on a lake to entertain guests.

Another water-powered design was the elephant clock, pictured, that would bang a drum every half an hour as a bucket was filled and emptied with water

Professor Noel Sharkey from the University of Sheffield recreated a model, based on Al-Jazari’s design, which featured a programmable drum machine with pegs that moved into levers that operated the percussion.

The drummer could be made to play different rhythms and patterns if the pegs were moved to different locations on the boat.

Another was the elephant clock.

According to the designs, a bucket of water was hidden inside a model elephant that took half an hour to fill.

As the bucket sinks with the weight of the water, it pulls a string attached to a see-saw on top of the clock.

A swinging see-saw swings releases a ball that drops into the mouth of a model snake, causing the snake to tip forward.

The bucket is attached to the tail of the snake and as the snake swings, the bucket is removed from the water. It then slowly begins to fill up again over the course of another 30 minutes.

When this happens, a figure hits a drum to indicate the hour or half-hour mark.

A working replica was built for Ibn Battuta Mall in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, while another can be found in the Musée d'Horlogerie du Locle, Château des Monts, in Le Locle, Switzerland.
