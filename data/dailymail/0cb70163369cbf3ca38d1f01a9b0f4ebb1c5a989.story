A 40-year-old mother-of-seven has been mauled to death by a pack of dogs after they attacked her at an Indian reservation in Wyoming.

Deanne 'Tyvones' Coando, a member of the Eastern Shoshone Tribe, was walking through Fort Washakie in the two-million-acre Wind River Indian Reservation when the animals pounced.

She was rushed to Riverton Hospital with serious injuries, hypothermia and a severe loss of blood after fellow tribe members heard her screams. Despite medics' best efforts, she shortly died.

Police are investigating Ms Coando's death on Wednesday, which has left tribal officials both shocked and skeptical. The ownership and whereabouts of the dogs remain unclear.

On Monday, Kimberly Varilek, attorney general of the Eastern Shoshone Tribe, said it was the first time the tribe - which has a population of fewer than 2,000 - had heard about such an attack.

'The tribes have ordinances and deal with dogs running around as any government does,' said Ms Varilek, whose tribe shares the central Wyoming reservation with the Northern Arapho Tribe.

'It's not really been an issue, we've not had a series of dog attacks or anything like that against people. There may be some skepticism because it's so unheard of.'

Last week, Ms Coando's children -  Jerel, Jayshauna, Jaden and Autumn Tillman, Adriaona and Damion Jr Loneman and Jewel Coando - took to social media to express their grief at her death.

Jayshauna posted a photo of her and her mother to Facebook, with the caption: 'Guna miss you n all da gud times we had mom :'(', while Jaden simply wrote: 'My life sucks.' 

Speaking of the mauling, Mark Stratmoen, chief deputy Fremont County coroner, said Ms Coando suffered 'serious' injuries from 'multiple dogs' and was alone at the time of the incident.

He added that he was not aware of any other fatal dog attacks in the area, but urged the public to watch for aggressive canines and immediately report any problems to law enforcement.

Meanwhile, Sergio Maldonado, Sr, a member of the Northern Arapaho Tribe, said he had not heard of any issues on the reservation regarding packs of dogs threatening people.

'I don't mind sharing with you my observation that we have too many dogs on the reservation, probably cats, too, he said, adding that it is common to see dogs that are hungry and cold.

'It's not a problem safety wise for people and livestock. I haven't heard of anything like that.' 

He said vets had offered free spaying and neutering services over the weekend, which numerous residents had attended. 

Ms Coando, who had two grandchildren JayDonna and Jayess, is also survived by her parents.

Memorial services were held at Rocky Mountain Hall in Fort Washakie on Sunday and Monday.
