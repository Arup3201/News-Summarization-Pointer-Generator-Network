Hillary Clinton has claimed it is by no means a foregone conclusion that she’ll be running for the presidency in 2016.

In her first major interview since leaving the State Department on Feb. 1, Clinton said that she will be both ‘pragmatic and realistic’ when it eventually comes time to decide.

The former secretary of state and first lady is the leading contender for the Democratic nomination, but claims she hasn’t made a definitive decision.

Hillary Clinton has said that she'll be both 'pragmatic and realistic' when it comes time to decide to she's gong to enter the running for 2016

‘I’m not in any hurry. I think it’s a serious decision, not to be made lightly, but it’s also not one that has to be made soon,’ she told New York Magazine.

Clinton, who was speaking ahead of the next week’s annual Clinton Global Initiative meeting in New York, was quick to dismiss speculation about 2016 by saying she doesn't ‘think it's good for the country.’

‘It’s like when you meet somebody at a party and they look over your shoulder to see who else is there, and you want to talk to them about something that’s really important; in fact, maybe you came to the party to talk to that particular person, and they just want to know what’s next,’ Clinton said.

‘I feel like that’s our political process right now. I just don’t think it is good.’

Clinton said she's enjoying being able to spend more quality time with her husband - former President Bill Clinton.

‘We get to be at home together a lot more now than we used to in the last few years,’ Clinton said.

‘We have a great time; we laugh at our dogs; we watch stupid movies; we take long walks; we go for a swim. You know, just ordinary, everyday pleasures.’

Clinton said her husband is also ignoring talk of her potential 2016 presidential run.

‘I don’t think even he is, you know, focused on that right now,’ she said. ‘Right now, we’re trying to just have the best time we can have doin’ what we’re doin’. ’

However she wasn’t shy about talking up her qualifications for the job, in particular following her term as secretary of state.

Hillary Clinton has spoken of her 'personal friendship' with President Obama cultivated during her term as secretary of state

‘I’ve had a unique, close, and personal 
front-row seat. And I think these last four years have certainly 
deepened and broadened my understanding of the challenges and the 
opportunities that we face in the world today,’ she said.

She also spoke of her ‘personal friendship’ with President Obama.

‘I feel comfortable raising issues with him,’ she said. ‘I had a very positive set of interactions, even when I disagreed, which obviously occurred, because obviously I have my own opinions, my own views.’

Asked is she wrestles with running for president, Clinton said, 'I do. But I’m both pragmatic and realistic. I think I have a pretty good idea of the political and governmental challenges that are facing our leaders, and I’ll do whatever I can from whatever position I find myself in to advocate for the values and the policies I think are right for the country.'

'I will just continue to weigh what the factors are that would influence me making a decision one way or the other,' she said.

The annual Clinton Global Initiative meeting starts on Monday in New York and all three Clintons will speak at the event

Despite the Clinton's reluctance to seriously speculate about 2016, the buzz about her anticipated bid refuses to go away.

On ‘State of the Union’ on Sunday, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) described Clinton as ‘one of the best-equipped, best-prepared people to enter the White House in a very long time,’ and said she was ‘more prepared’ than the last three presidents to enter the White House.

On ‘Meet The Press’ on Sunday, conservative pundit Bill Kristol said Clinton was ‘a good candidate for Republicans to run against.’

The annual Clinton Global Initiative meeting takes place from Sept. 23 to 26 at the Sheraton Hotel in Times Square.

President Obama, Bill Gates, IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde, Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg, CNN's Piers Morgan, U2 frontman Bono and all three Clintons - including daughter Chelsea - are featured speakers.
