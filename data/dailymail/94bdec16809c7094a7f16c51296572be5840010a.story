A toddler completely buried by rubble following air strikes in Syria has miraculously been pulled out alive by men who used their bare hands to reach him.

Incredible footage surfaced on YouTube on Friday of a group of men in rebel-held Aleppo frantically digging through pulverised rock and dust to reach the young boy.

It's not until near the two-minute mark of the eight-minute-long footage, uploaded by Syrian rebels, that the boy is first glimpsed.

Miraculous: A toddler was pulled alive from rubble after being buried following an air strike in Aleppo, Syria

Determined: A group of men dug with their bare hands to reach the young boy

Several minutes later he is pulled free looking bewildered and tearful, but seemingly unhurt, as the men around him rejoice.

Meanwhile, the first face-to-face meeting between Syria's government and the opposition hoping to overthrow president Bashar Assad has started.

After tense days spent avoiding each other and meeting separately with a UN mediator, Mr Assad's hand-picked delegation and representatives of the Syrian National Coalition were gathering in the same room on Saturday in hopes of ultimately finding a path out of the civil war.

The two sides were distant going into the meeting, with the Damascus delegation denying it had accepted the premise of a transitional leadership, and the opposition saying it would accept nothing less.

'We'll try our best to make it as successful as possible,' said Anas al-Abdeh, a member of the Syrian National Coalition's negotiating team.

Syrian deputy foreign minister Faisal al-Mikdad said Saturday would focus on 'modest ideas'.
