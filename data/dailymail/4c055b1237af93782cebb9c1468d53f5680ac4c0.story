Hey big spender! Arsene Wenger will have a £100m transfer budget after signing a new deal

Arsenal will hand Wenger a £100million transfer fund this summer who said: ‘We know we have to have a successful June and July, that’s where you strengthen the team,’ said the Gunners boss. 

‘It’s very important that we are good now in the next two months until the end of August, that we can give to the team some more quality and go into next season with the belief we got from [the FA Cup] win.

‘Should the fans expect a big summer? Yes, they should expect that. 

‘What I can promise is that we work very hard in a market that is very, very congested with many people who have a lot of money. 

‘But we have a big advantage, players want to join us and if we find the right quality I’m sure we can strengthen the team.

A new dawn? Winning the FA Cup will give Arsenal more belief according to the Gunners manager

He added: ‘We are entering a very exciting period. We have a strong squad, financial stability and huge support around the world.

'The club has always shown faith in me and I’m very grateful for that. We have gone through fantastic periods and also periods where we have had to stick together. 

‘Every time when that togetherness was tested I got the right response. I think I have shown some loyalty towards this club and hopefully we can make some more history.

French fancy: Real Madrid striker Karim Benzema (L) is on Arsene Wenger's most wanted list

‘It’s time for another great Arsenal team [to emerge]. It’s the start of a new team and I believe [the FA Cup] victory was crucial in that belief.’

Wenger has prioritised three positions to strengthen this summer: right-back, central midfielder and centre forward.

He also needs a new back-up goalkeeper following the departure of Lukasz Fabianski to Swansea.

Spending spree: Lars Bender (L) and Loic Remy (R) are also being considered by the Arsenal manager

Atsuto Uchida (Schalke), Callum Chambers (Southampton) and Serge Aurier (Toulouse) feature on the club’s list of potential right-backs.

Lars Bender (Bayer Leverkusen) and Morgan Schneiderlin (Southampton) are contenders to for the midfield signing, while a move for former captain Cesc Fabregas is not being ruled out.
