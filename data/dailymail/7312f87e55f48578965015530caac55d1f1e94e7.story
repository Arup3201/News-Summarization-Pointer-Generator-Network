Nasa wants to build a manned base which can be 'parked' beyond the dark side of the moon as a 'gateway spacecraft', to serve as a starting point for manned expeditions to Mars.

It would remain permanently in space 277,000 miles from Earth - in context, the International Space Station is just 230 miles away.

The spaceship would expand man's 
horizons - but it will require much problem-solving to figure out how to
protect astronauts from radiation, and how to re-supply the ship from a
quarter of a million miles away.

On the way to Mars: Nasa is exploring the possibility of placing an Orion space station in a stable location on the far side of the moon

The Orlando Sentinel reports that 
Nasa will likely use parts left over from the construction of the ISS, 
and will need to use the Space Launch System 
rocket to get the craft out of the atmosphere.

The launch project is currently being built at an estimated cost of $3billion a year, and should be ready in 2017.

Nasa then plans to begin building the moon outpost two years after that.

The Orlando Sentinal reports that 
Nasa spoke to the White House about the idea last month, but whether the
U.S. Congress will support the multi-billion-dollar project is not yet 
known.

The U.S. space agency is forming a 
team to draw up plans for the outpost, to be parked at a spot in space 
known as the Earth-moon libration point 2 (EML-2).

Libration
points are 'parking spots' in space where an object can be balanced 
between the gravitational pull of two large masses - such as the Earth 
and the moo, meaning Nasa can effectively 'park' the vehicle there.

Nasa's report said that placing a 
spacecraft at the Earth-Moon Lagrange Point 'beyond the moon as a test 
area for human access to deep space is the best near-term option to 
develop required flight experience and mitigate risk.'

Nasa spokesman David Weaver said: 'There are many options - and many routes - being discussed on our way to the Red Planet.

'In addition to the moon and an 
asteroid, other options may be considered as we look for ways to buy 
down risk - and make it easier - to get to Mars.'
