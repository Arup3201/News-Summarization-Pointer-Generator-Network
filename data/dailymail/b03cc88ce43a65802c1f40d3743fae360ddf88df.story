Young men in India are risking their lives for love, paying roadside tattooists to ink their girlfriends' names on their bodies.

Scores of artists line the streets of Delhi's old quarter, where professionally sterilised equipment is in short supply.

A basic design can cost as little as 50p but customers run the risk of contracting blood-borne viruses such as HIV or bacterial infections from unsterilised needles.

Many hard-up youngsters are willing to run the risk to save going to a tattoo parlour where they can end up paying hundreds of pounds.

Ramesh Kumar, who has been a street tattoo artist for four years, says most of his clients are young people and students who want to get the names of their girlfriend or boyfriend inked on their body.

Others want images of gods or will pick a design from the tattooist's own creations.

He says he never gets any complaints from customers regarding infections.

Some of the so-called 'artists' are actually just amateurs who draw wonky designs or misspell names.

Some use acrylic paints which can harm the skin, rather than the specialist ink utilised by professionals.

The tattoo artists line the streets of Delhi's Old Quarter day after day enticing customers with their cheap prices.

But the practice is illegal and they make sure their equipment is easily portable for when the police arrive and give chase.

However, it is never that long before they are back up and running again - and looking for new clients.
