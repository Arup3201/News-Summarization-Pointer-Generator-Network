Ever since Pippa 
Middleton and Kim Sears stepped out armed with their trusty Aspinal of London handbags, they have fast became the season's must-have arm candy.

But if the Marylebone tote's super slick design and clutch of celebrity fans wasn't enough, it just got better (and a lot more expensive).

While Pippa and Kim's luxurious leather totes cost around an eye-watering £1,000, Aspinal of London has created its most exclusive limited-edition handbag to date.

The brand has created the diamond-dusted crocodile Marylebone tote - but at £18,000, could it be too much for even Kim and Pippa's beloved other halves to afford?

The new bag, which is to be sold exclusively in Harrods (where else?), has been handcrafted using crocodile skin and hand-finished with two-carat diamonds to create a 'dazzling finish', says the brand.

'Guaranteed to turn heads, this breathtaking and ultra-luxurious creation will be strictly limited edition and available only while stocks last,' says the brand.

Other famous fans of 
the luxury British brand include Millie Mackintosh, who is often spotted
 with her Marylebone tote, as well as Amanda Holden, and Mollie King, who has a satchel named after her.
