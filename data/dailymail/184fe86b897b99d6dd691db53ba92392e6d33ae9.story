This is the moment a Christmas turkey was roasted on the world's most expensive cooker - a £300,000 Lamborghini.

Car blogger Tim Burton, from London, bought a fresh turkey and put the festive bird on the end of a pitchfork.

He then bravely stood behind the 700bhp Lamborghini Aventador and got the owner of the supercar to rev as hard as he could.

Inferno: Car blogger Tim Burton bought a fresh turkey and put the festive bird on the end of a pitchfork

Ready to eat! The browned turkey was roasted in 10 minutes but this method is unlikely to replace the oven

As the Italian motor reached a whopping 9,000 revs, huge flames spewed from its exhaust - blasting the turkey with extreme heat.

Mr Burton, who makes YouTube videos under the name Shmee150, stood while the bird was given the alternative Christmas roasting for more than ten minutes.

The result was a browned turkey - although the high octane method is unlikely to replace the oven around the country any time soon.

Danger: The bird is placed near the engine before the owner revs with Mr Burton just inches from the flames

Heat: Mr Burton stood behind the 700bhp Lamborghini Aventador and got the owner of the supercar to rev

Extreme: As the Italian motor reached a whopping 9,000 revs, huge flames spewed from its exhaust

Expensive: The £300,000 car which was used for the cooking experiment - but is better suited to driving

He said: 'It is a standard Christmas ritual that I collect the turkey for our family lunch and this year I thought I'd try a new way to cook it.

'I'm not sure I'd recommend this though unless you enjoy the taste of exhaust gases.'
