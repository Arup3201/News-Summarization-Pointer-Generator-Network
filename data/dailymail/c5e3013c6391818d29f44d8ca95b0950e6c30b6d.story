The issue of gender equality has been a hotly contested subject in the workplace for several years now, and recent statistics show that nothing much has changed.

There are only three countries in the entire world where you are more likely to have a female boss than a male boss.

A study by US research firm, Expert Market, looking at data from the International Labour Organisation (ILO) revealed that Jamaica is the country where you're most likely to have a female boss. 

Jamaica, Colombia and Saint Lucia, all relatively close to each other, have the highest percentage of female managers in the world

The Caribbean island had the world's highest percentage, at nearly 60 per cent. 

Out of the 108 world countries taken into consideration, Columbia was closely behind with 53.1 per cent of their managers being female, and in third place was another island, Saint Lucia, with 52.3 per cent. 

Closely following Jamaica at the top were the Phillipines at 47.6 per cent, as well as a series of other Latin America countries.

Panama came in at fifth place and Guatemala was eighth while Eastern European countries were prevalent in the top ten, with Belarus sixth and Latvia coming in at seventh place.

Britain ranked relatively poorly and came in at 41st place out of 108 of the surveyed countries, as only 34.2 per cent of managers are women.

Although the UK surpassed countries such as Germany (31.1 per cent), Spain (30 per cent) and China (16.8 per cent), it lagged behind major economies such as France (39.4 per cent), Russia (39.1 per cent) and Australia (36.2 per cent).

More surprisingly was that Britain, as a first-world country, fell behind developing regions such as Kazakhstan (which had 37.2 per cent female bosses) and Moldova (ranking at 44.1 per cent of managers being women).

The United States was ranked within the top 20 countries in the world, at 15th place, as 42.7 per cent of all managers are female. 

Pakistan was ranked as the worst country in the world for having female managers, at a meagre three per cent.

The other poorly ranking countries included Algeria (at 4.9 per cent) and Jordan (at 5.1 per cent).

Michael Horrocks, brand manager at Expert Market, commented: 'It is promising to see that in a growing number of regions around the world, women are increasingly entering management positions and playing a more important role in business strategy.'

Although the survey also revealed that nearly a third of all businesses around the world are now owned or managed by women, even more disheartening is the number of CEOs in large companies.

There are currently only five female chief executives in the FTSE 100: Moya Greene at the Royal Mail, Alison Cooper at Imperial Tobacco, Carolyn McCall at easyJet, Liv Garfield at Severn Trent and Veronique Laury at Kingfisher.
