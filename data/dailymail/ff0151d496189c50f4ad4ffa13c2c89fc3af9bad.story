A mother-of-two was tragically struck and killed by a pick up truck that veered onto the wrong side of the road Monday while she was cycling with her daughters. 

Andrea Boeve, 33, was riding along Highway 270 near Steen, Minnesota, pulling her daughters, ages 1 and 4, behind her in a passenger trailer at around 11:30a.m. when a 2003 Chevy pickup truck crossed the white line and hit her.

Boeve, who along with her children was wearing a safety helmet, was crushed by the truck.

Her 4-year-old suffered broken ribs and a punctured lung, and the 1-year-old, who was also strapped into a safety seat, had only minor injuries, according to the Argus Leader.

Both girls were rushed to a nearby hospital where they received treatment.

The driver, Christopher Weber, 25, of Brandon, South Dakota, was allegedly using his cell phone when the crash took place. He was uninjured.

But Lt. Matt Sorenson of the Minnesota 
State Patrol said he was charged with one count of criminal vehicular 
homicide and one count of criminal vehicular operation.

He was being held at the Nobles County Jail before a court appearance.

Boeve was legally riding on the side of the road in the same direction as traffic, according to the Minnesota State Patrol.

She was just a quarter-mile from the family's home when the fatal accident occurred and her death has left the community reeling.

A school friend of Boeve, Kim Peterson, told the Argus Leader she was in shock when she heard the news.

'It's a really tragic ordeal and my heart goes out to those two girls who will not be able to know their mom and how great she really was,' she said.

'There are a lot of people whose hearts are broken and a lot of prayers go out to them,' Reuben Sinnema, Youth Pastor for The Reformed Church of Steen told Keloland.com.

Andrea Boeve, her husband, Matt Boeve, and their girls Claire and Mallorie, went to church.

Steen, Minnesota, Mayor Melvin Van Batavia called the family, who run a large cattle ranch west of town, 'pillars of the community.'

'Our little community has been hit hard,' he said.

A Go Fund Me account has been setup to help Andrea's two little girls and husband.
