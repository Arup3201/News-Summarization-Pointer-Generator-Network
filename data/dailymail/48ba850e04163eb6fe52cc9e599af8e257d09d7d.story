British soldiers have returned to Iraq to train Kurdish fighters in using heavy weapons as the fight against ISIS intensifies.

The Ministry of Defence confirmed that the 'small specialist team' will be based near the Kurdish capital of Irbil in northern Iraq after their deployment was approved by Defence Secretary Michael Fallon.

While in the war-torn region, the troops will train the Kurdish peshmerga forces to use the heavy weapons supplied to them last month.

The peshmerga forces are said to be overrun in northern Iraq and have had weapons supplied to them in their fight against ISIS 

It comes five years afer the last combat troops left Iraq after British forces invaded in 2003 to overthrow Saddam Hussein.

According to the Sunday Times, the troops will come from the 2nd Battalion the Yorkshire Regiment, who are based in Cyprus.

They also reported that Briain has sent 61 tons of machineguns and ammunition to the Kurds.

It is thought they will teach the Kurds how to fire the powerful L1A1 12.7mm machine gun.

Defence Secretary Michael Fallon approved the deployment of the ground troops, who will be based near Irbil 

A Ministry of Defence spokeswoman said: 'The Government has previously made clear its intention to provide training to the Peshmerga as part of the continued effort to assist in the fight against Isil (ISIS).

The SAS used the world's most powerful sniper rifle to halt ISIS killers in Iraq, it has been reported. 

It is thought that the SAS team used the AW50 weapon to shoot at a lorry taking militants to a undefended Iraqi village. 

According to the Daily Star Sunday, the troops feared they were going to target vulnerable civilians so decided to deploy the gun. 

The first shot is said to have hit the truck's engine, which split in two. 

And when the jihadists tried to flee in a second vehicle, they destroyed that too. 

The AW50 is described as a high-calibre, long range weapon, capable of taking out enemies from extreme distances.

'The Defence Secretary has approved the deployment of a small specialist team of non-combat Army trainers which is now in the Irbil area providing instruction on operating, employing and maintaining the heavy machine guns that were gifted by the UK last month.'

It is also believed that a number of special forces are also operating in the region as part of efforts to track down those responsible for the beheadings of four hostages including David Haines and Alan Henning.

It comes as RAF Tornado fighter-bombers have been taking part in US-led bombing raids ISIS, for a fortnight.

But there is strong resistance among politicians to any ground troop involvement in fighting against the Islamist group, which controls a vast swathe of Iraq and neighbouring Syria.

The news of British troops being sent back to Iraq comes after other western countries including the United States also began training Kurdish peshmerga forces.

It is thought that ISIS militants have overru around a thrid of the country.

More than 100 instructors from Germany, Canada, Australia and United States are now on the ground in Iraqi Kurdistan, teaching the region's peshmerga forces how to use the new weapons.

It has been reported that the United States, France, Italy, Germany, Canada, Australia and Czech Republic have also sent weapons to Kurds.
