Peter Dowling resigned after a letter was written to parliament accusing him of having an affair

An Australian politician has resigned after he was caught sexting lewd pictures to his mistress.

Married Peter Dowling, a member of Queensland state's ruling conservative Liberal National Party, has also been accused of using government funds to conduct a two-year affair.

The woman claiming to be his mistress wrote to state parliament Speaker Fiona Simpson detailing their trysts.

Dowling has been with wife Helen for 27 years and they have two children together, reported the Huffington Post.

But, the mistress said that she had been assured his marriage was just for show and that he intended to leave her after the 2015 election.

She added that she was just one of many woman the politician had an affair with.

The Courier-Mail has also claimed that it has access to: ‘Several explicit text messages sent from Mr. Dowling's mobile phone to the woman, including a picture of his penis in a glass of red wine, a self-shot image of his crotch while wearing boxer shorts, and a full frontal picture of his genitalia.’

Mr Dowling is also accused of taking advantage of parliament business trips to meet the woman.Her name was not released and her face was blacked out in published photos of her and the politician.

Dowling, a Catholic and family-man, was part of the Australian Parliament’s ethics committee.

Mr Dowling said he was stepping down 
as ethics committee chairman and from the parliamentary crime and 
misconduct committee until an investigation by the Clerk of Parliament 
into his travel is complete. 

In
 a statement after his resignation, Dowling said: ‘To Helen, to my 
children, mum, brother and sister, my extended family and friends, I am 
sorry for the shame and embarrassment I have caused you. I am not proud 
of the events plastered all over today's paper and I cannot and will not
 defend any part of it.’

He allegedly sent a photograph of his penis in a glass of wine (stock pictured)

'In relation to the allegations made to the use of travel allowances, I can assure the House that I have complied fully with all the guidelines and requirements of the parliament,' he said.

'However, I do not wish for this issue and for my family to be dragged through the media any longer than necessary. I will answer any questions, front any investigation.

'I don't want pity. I only ask that my family be left alone while this matter is considered by the clerk.'

A senior government official told The Australian that he couldn’t understand how a ‘smart’ man like Dowling could do that.

He added: ‘Taking a picture of your penis in a glass of red isn't the smartest thing you could do, and I won't be accepting any invitation from him in the future to go for a drink.’

This comes after New York Mayoral candidate Anthony Wiener was discovered sexting and sending lewd pictures of himself to a 22-year-old.

Weiner said that as their marriage deteriorated he had returned to sexting women lewd pictures of himself.

He also confessed to frequent phone sex with 22-year-old Sydney Leathers and sending pictures of himself to two other women under the pseudonym Carlos Danger.

Leathers claims Weiner was texting and calling her for graphic phone sex up to five times a day through Election Day 2012

She now says she wants to confront her ex-online lover ‘face to face so she can tell him to ‘stop being a hypocrite, stop humiliating his wife and stop embarrassing the city.’

She said Weiner had told her nearly 100 times over-the-phone, ‘The people of New York love me.’
