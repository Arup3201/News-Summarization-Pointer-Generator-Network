SpaghettiOs made a faux pas on the 72nd anniversary of Japan's attack on the Pearl Harbor naval base when it decided to remember the event by tweeting a photo of it's grinning mascot with an American Flag.

'Take a moment to remember #Pearlharbor with us,' read the tweet last Friday night.

Pearl Harbor commemorates the death of 2,386 Americans and is a national tragedy.

This photo of a smililing pasta-O holding an American flag left many saying, 'oh no'

The company's attempt to sell SpaghettiOs with a smile on a tragic remembrance got some twitter users talking.

'Hope nobody minds if I chose to remember Pearl Harbor and forever forget @SpaghettiOs. #TastelessCorporation,' said twitter user simply Laura.

'I can't wait for the official @spaghettiOs 9/11 tweet,' said Suzan Eraslan.

'@SpaghettiOs maybe sit out the next couple plays,' said Andy Levy.

Once SpaghettiOs caught wind of the fact that they offended the blogosphere, they issued a formal apology on December 7.

'We apologize for our recent tweet in remembrance of Pearl Harbor Day. We meant to pay respect, not to offend.'

Marketingland.com reported that the offensive tweet got over 3,000 retweets but not out of popularity, rather out of disgust.

They have since deleted their original posting.

According to thinkprogress.org,this is not the first time corporations have tried to use public holidays to promote their brand--even if it's considered inappropriate.

On Veterans' Day, the movie Man of Steel tweeted out a picture of their movie along with a 'thank the troops message.'

The brand Kenneth Cole tweeted during the revolutionary uprise in Egypt and said, 'Millions are in uproar in #Cairo. Rumor is they heard our new Spring collection is available online.

SpaghettiOs which is an American brand under the umbrella company Campbell's Soup features circular pasta covered in a cheese and tomato sauce. It comes in a can and is marketed to parents as 'less messy' than regular pasta.

If only the same thing could be said about their 'messy' advertising practices.
