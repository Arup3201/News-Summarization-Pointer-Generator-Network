This prairie dog doesn’t look as though he could cause much
trouble.

But rabbit-sized Willy may be Germany’s most prolific escapee.

The crafty creature has absconded from his zoo enclosure more
than 100 times – to the frustration of his keeper.

Prairie dog Willy has escaped from his enclosure more than 100 times to explore his zoo in Halle, Germany

Petra Strecker, of Bergzoo in Halle, is usually responsible for finding Willy and bringing him home.

‘Willy has lived with us since April. Initially, without any problems,’ she said.

'However, in June, the
rascal discovered that he could climb over the boundary wall.’

Willy initially had no problems at the zoo after arriving in April but escaped for the first time in June

Willy will no longer be able to explore the zoo after plexiglass was installed above and below his wall

Willy often used to leave his enclosure to wander around and
explore the rest of the zoo.

But now those days appear to be over for the prairie dog

To the relief of Ms Strecker, the zoo has installed
plexiglass above and below his wall to stop him from escaping.

Native to North America’s prairies, the creatures usually live in elaborate warrens
of tunnels and chambers.

They generally live in family groups – one male, a few females and their
young – and emerge from their burrows during daylight hours to forage and feed.

They weigh up to 2kg, have
bodies of between 12 to 15 inches long and their tails can grow to 4 inches.

The herbivores live for between three and four years.
