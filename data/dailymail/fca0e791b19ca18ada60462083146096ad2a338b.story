Broadcasters will be subjected to spot checks to ensure children on television shows are protected from cruel treatment and inappropriate language, media watchdog Ofcom said yesterday.

The decision comes after concerns about the welfare of youngsters in Line of Duty, I’m A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here and Dick and Dom’s Hoopla.

Ofcom said it would also give broadcasters a stern reminder about their duty of care towards under-18s.

Trouble: The BBC has been criticised after Gregory Piper was allowed to play a gang member who attempted to sever a policeman's fingers with bolt cutters

Ofcom has found the BBC was guilty of 
exposing a 13-year-old to gruesome violence and sexually explicit 
language when he appeared on crime drama Line of Duty.

During crime drama Line of Duty, child actor Gregory Piper plays a gang member and is seen attempting to sever a policeman’s fingers with bolt cutters.

His character, Ryan Pilkington, repeatedly uses swear words and is also head-butted by the man he is torturing.

In one scene during the BBC2 show, a police officer is heard using sexually explicit language as he interviews Ryan.

The BBC defended the scenes in Line Of
Duty saying it had been in constant dialogue with the teenage actor’s 
parents who were comfortable that he would not be emotionally affected 
by the role.

But Ofcom 
said the teenager had appeared in scenes which had been ‘of a 
particularly violent nature and included sexually explicit language’.

It
said the programme, for which it received a single complaint, had 
breached its broadcasting code which states that ‘due care must be taken
over the physical and emotional welfare’ of under-18s irrespective of 
any consent given by a parent.

The watchdog is also investigating 
ITV’s I’m A Celebrity… for using Kiki, the seven-year-old daughter of 
contestant Charlie Brooks, for a stunt, and children’s BBC show Dick and
Dom’s Hoopla, after a child was left retching following a challenge 
which involved eating a mixture of apple sauce and mayonnaise.

The
regulator also criticised the BBC for not having someone directly 
looking over the teenager’s interests and suggested the broadcaster 
should have sought expert opinion on whether it was appropriate for him 
to have taken part in the scenes. The two episodes aired in July.

The decision to look into the use of 
Kiki Brooks on I’m A Celebrity comes following the outcry from hundreds 
of viewers who watched the game unfold.

On
the programme Miss Brooks, 31, who is well-known for playing the role 
of Janine in BBC1 soap EastEnders, and darts ace Eric Bristow had to 
choose from a selection of doors that had treats behind them in this 
year’s series of the jungle show.

The
actress did not know that Kiki, who had not seen her mother for 18 
days, was behind one of the doors in the challenge and missed out on the
reunion after picking the wrong door.

Brooks later criticised the stunt and said it had been “heart-breaking”.

‘I signed up for this show, but Kiki didn’t. I didn’t want her to be so upset. I had no idea this was happening. It was my lowest point,’ she said.

‘My mum gave the green light for her to be there because it was an opportunity for Kiki to see me - and I think she thought she would.’

Viewers also complained, while campaign group Parents Outloud said: ‘To involve a seven-year-old is sinking to the bottom.’

But a spokesman for the show said at the time that a senior producer had seen ‘Kiki afterwards and she was fine’.
