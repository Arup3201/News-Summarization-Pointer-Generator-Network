Sam Allardyce claims Arsene Wenger is the ultimate manager as he prepares to take on Arsenal on Sunday.

The West Ham manager has the greatest respect for Wenger, who oversaw Arsenal’s move to the Emirates Stadium without sacrificing Champions League football.

Allardyce, planning for West Ham’s move to the Olympic Stadium in 2016, said: ‘He’s been manager, accountant and financial director, there is no doubt about that.

West Ham manager Sam Allardyce has come out in praise of Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger 

Allardyce said Wenger had to be much more than just a manager during the move to the Emirates Stadium

‘The man set out a fantastic team before they decided to move and then built a couple of brilliant young teams based on the fact that the same amount of finance didn’t appear to be available to him.

‘Now he has almost got the Emirates paid off. That’s his achievement and it is a massive factor considering it was a massive investment for them [Arsenal].’

Allardyce added: ‘The one thing we have got to our advantage is that we don’t have to pay £450 million for our new stadium, which is the best bit of business ever done in football by a set of owners.’

West Ham dropped to fifth in the Premier League after their 2-0 defeat at Chelsea on Boxing Day, but Allardyce insists Arsenal will not relish visiting Upton Park.

‘We have turned it into a real fortress again and I hope that is going to be the case against Arsenal,’ he said.
