A couple who received poor service at a restaurant still left a $100 tip along with a sweet note.

Makenzie Schultz and her husband Steven, from Iowa, were at a local restaurant celebrating their sixth anniversary when they say it became clear the service 'sucked.'

The pair, who had arranged a babysitter for their sons, were left disappointed after waiting 20 minutes for water, 40 minutes for an appetizer and more than an hour for the entrée.

A couple who received poor service at a restaurant still left a $100 tip along with a sweet note

Makenzie Schultz and her husband Steven, from Iowa, were at a local restaurant celebrating their sixth anniversary when they say it became clear the service 'sucked'

But said that they soon realised the terrible service was down to staffing issues and not the fault of their server who was 'running around like crazy and never acted annoyed with any table.' 

Schultz, whose Facebook lists her husband as owning a 'BBQ restaurant', decided when they left to leave the generous tip and along with a note which read: ''We've both been in your shoes. Paying it forward.'

Their meal came to $66 and Schultz posted a photo of their tip on Facebook - the image has been shared almost 150,000 times.

Next to the photo Schultz wrote:'So here's the deal. Our service tonight sucked. Took 20 minutes to get water, 40 minutes for an appetizer and over an hour for our entree. People all around us were making fun of the restaurant & how bad the service was. 

'Yeah, it was pretty terrible. But, it was very obvious that the issue was being short staffed, not the server. 

'He was running around like crazy and never acted annoyed with any table. At one point we counted he had 12 tables plus the bar. 

More than any one person could handle! As I sat there and watched him run back & forth and apologize for the wait, I said to Steven... Wow, this used to be us. Waiting tables. I don't miss it at all and I never loved that job. I did it for the tips. 

'Steven and I agreed it would feel good to make this guys night when he would probably be getting minimal to no tips due to slow service. 

'We walked out before he saw this and I'm not posting this for a pat on the back. I'm just sharing this as a friendly reminder to think of the entire situation, before you judge. And always always always remember where you came from.'

It is not clear from the receipt where the couple were dining.

Schultz's Facebook lists her as working for It Works, a skin care and nutrition company.

On her Facebook page a user wrote: 'It Works Global asked all of our top leaders at DASH to leave a random act of kindness. 

'Makenzie Schultz took it to a whole notha level and now her act of kindness has gone viral. One person can start a movement. ‪#‎StartsWithOne.'
