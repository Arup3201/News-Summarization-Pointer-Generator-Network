A young Chinese woman has overcome the tricky problem of providing care for her elderly grandmother - by taking her to work with her every day.

Huang Lihua, 24, from south-western China’s Chongqing municipality said that when she was a young child both of her parents needed to go to work. As a result they had sent her to stay with her grandmother Wan Zongsiu, 88, in the countryside.

She said: 'Some people say to me that it must have been very difficult leaving the city and my parents and going to live in the countryside where nothing happened and I didn't know anybody.'

She added: 'But actually the time there with my grandmother was one of the happiest of my life. I was very young actually when I went there first, I was just two, but I remember that my grandmother was very kind taking me with her everywhere.

'She never left me locked up in the house, if she was going to the market or visiting friends or working in the fields, she took me along. And I never wanted anything more, there was always good food to eat and lots of love.'

Shortly after she started going to school she returned to the city and her parents but never forgot her time with her grandmother.

After leaving school she first went to work in south-eastern China’s Guangdong province where she earned enough money to return to her parent's home and start her own business, a fast food restaurant in the city.

She said: 'I have everything I want in my life now - a boyfriend who I love very much and a business that is doing well.

'Therefore it was natural to me that I should think of my grandmother who gave me so much and started me off so well in life.'

Although her grandmother doesn't always feel well enough for the journey, she still makes the daily trip even if Huang has to carry her over the distance of just under a mile

'So I agreed to look after her but because she was used the countryside and this is the city she had difficulty fitting in, and then I came up with the idea of taking her with me to work.

'There is always something going on and plenty of people to talk to, and now she is happy in the city.

'She sits outside the front and watches life go by and I can see that she is content.'

Although her grandmother doesn't always feel well enough for the journey, she still makes the daily trip even if Huang has to carry her the mile between work and home.

On good days that she can walk using a stick and said: 'I wouldn't miss my visits there for anything.'
