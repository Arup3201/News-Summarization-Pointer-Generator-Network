Princess Beatrice met brave young cancer patients today as she opened a state-of-the-art body scanner that will improve their treatment.

The princess was at the Royal Hospital for Sick Children (RHSC) in Edinburgh to see the gamma ray scanning system.

The 26-year-old, who works for Sony, was named Royal Patron for the Sick Kids Friends Foundation last year and has previously visited the hospital in Scotland to see the work they do.

For today's visit, where she was given the task of cutting the ribbon to officially open the scanner, she wore a navy blue dress under a smart cream coat. 

The scanner is the product of a £500,000 donation from the Sick Kids Friends Foundation (SKKF).

The old scanner treated 6,000 children in a 13 year period.

The new machine will enable doctors to run more advanced diagnostic tests and locate cancers which have spread, enabling them to offer a more prompt and precise treatment.

Dr Mark Brougham, an oncologist at RHSC, said: 'The new system helps us detect movement in cancers, something which is vital for working out the best treatment and response.

'It is more advanced than our previous equipment and enables us to see the cancer in more detail. The information the machine gives us benefits the hospital as a whole as better diagnosis can lead to more efficient treatment.'

Also present at the opening of the scanner were two of the children who will be using it. 

Emily Irving, 11, has been receiving treatment for Neuroblastoma, a cancer which arises in childhood and spreads from the nervous system, for a number of years.

Her carer, Elaine McGill, said: 'Emily has to have the treatment every year so it is really important the process isn't scary and it's a nice environment.

'The new scanner and room is a massive improvement on what was here before, it makes you forget what the function of the room is.'

The room and scanner have been designed to make treatment as comfortable possible for the RHSC patients, and was decorated by SKKF resident illustrator Cate James.

She said: 'I was asked to come up with a theme for the room and opted to go for underwater. It was nice to see the princess today but it's great to see the kids and know they like the new room.'
