Sydney’s renowned fireworks certainly did not disappoint last night, with a kaleidoscope of colours and patterns filling the sky across the city’s harbour and its famous bridge.

It was worth the wait for the 1.6 million punters who arrived as early as the morning of New Year's Eve to ensure they had prime position for the spectacular annual event, which attracts party-goers from all over the world.

It was a light-filled celebration, with a 12-storey bulb illuminated on the Harbour Bridge in recognition of 2015 being the International Year of Light and Light Technologies.

The massive crowd cheered with delight as the explosion of colour and lights continually lit up the shoreline, to see in 2015 in spectacular style.

A highlight was the pyrotechnic display cascading from the world-renowned coat-hanger, resembling an enormous flowing waterfall.

Sydney’s renowned fireworks did not disappoint with a kaleidoscope of colours and patterns filling the night sky across the city’s harbour and its famous bridge

It was worth wait for the 1.6 million punters who arrived hours earlier in the day to ensure they had a prime position for the spectacular annual event that attracts people from all over the world.

The City of Sydney also used the moment to pay tribute to the Sydney siege victims, Tori Johnson and Katrina Dawson.

The words 'We will remember' appeared on the Harbour Bridge pylons three times during the light display, represented as a 'floral' tribute.

It symbolised the many thousands of bouquets which were left at Martin Place by mourners, after the pair was tragically killed whilst being held hostage at the Lindt Cafe in Sydney's Martin Place. 

'It is in memory of the two young and talented people that we lost because of that siege,' said Sydney Lord Mayor Clover Moore.

'We remember the trauma the hostages experienced, the bravery of the police and we remember the way Sydney responded as we expected - an inclusive, welcoming, multicultural community,' she said.

The grand finale to welcome in 2015 followed a smaller, family friendly, 9pm display, as was the case in most Australian cities. 

The traditional prequel to the midnight annual spectacular is particularly suited to those with young children, who are often in a deep slumber by the time the clock strikes midnight. 

Two bright blue seahorses were the stars of the first act of the city's renowned fireworks display.

The 9pm display was followed by the Harbour of Light Parade, with more than 50 illuminated boats carrying more than 8,000 people on a majestic passage around the harbour.

Never an event to disappoint – both displays featured a total of seven tonnes of fireworks; including 11,000 shells, 25,000 shooting comets and more than 100,000 individual pyrotechnic effects. 

In what is believed to be a first, drones were be used to live stream the fireworks as they launched from the Harbour Bridge, the Opera House and several barges in the water.

They captured incredibly unique images, taking revellers closer to the action than ever before. Showers of sparks and flashes of light could be seen exploding across TV screens as the drones flew a little too close to the display. 

And as if that wasn't enough - a third mini-display, known as the 'Inspire moment', kicked off at 10.40 to keep crowds entertained in the lead-up to the much-anticipated countdown.

Revellers gathered on the foreshore wherever they could find room to catch a glimpse of the magical display

Thousands of people had started the festivities, streaming into Sydney's CBD in anticipation of the evening's spectacular fireworks display, with over 1.6 million Sydneysiders filling the Harbour, and half a million in Melbourne's Federation Square.

The Melbourne fireworks blanketed six square kilometres of the city, firing from 21 skyscrapers to delight the senses of up to 600,000 people. 

However the numbers in Brisbane were disappointing in comparison, with a mere 50,000 people assembling at Southbank to see in the New Year. 

It was a marked decrease on last year's crowd of 80,000 people. It is believed the muggy conditions were to blame for keeping residents at home. 

More than $90 thousand worth of fireworks were used in Brisbane's celebrations. 

In the nation's capital, more than 35,000 made their way into the heart of the city to usher in the new year, enjoying the sounds of Eskimo Joe and Joel Fletcher. There too revellers were treated to a double dose of fireworks at 9pm and then again at midnight.

Other icons were also part of the display, with the Sydney Opera House illuminated in an explosion of pink

A symphony of reds, greens, pinks, blues and whites burst over the harbour, which ascended into a waterfall of red and yellow, hurtling from the bottom of the Harbour Bridge

Australia's dear country cousin New Zealand was the first to celebrate the new year with a dazzling light display at the top of the Sky Tower in Auckland as the revellers saw in the new year two hours earlier than their Down Under pals.

A party atmosphere had built before the show in Sydney's Botanic Gardens where some had been queuing since dawn to get in.

Those who had bagged the best spots to watch the fireworks relaxed on blankets in the last of the day's sunshine, many wearing 2015 headdresses and clinking drinks.

As the dark descended, loud cheers rang out among the throng in anticipation of the start of the night's celebrations.

Calli Newman, from Ohio in the United States, had travelled from Brisbane saying: 'I've wanted to do this for ages.'

Her friend, Chris Porter, added: 'When you Google the best places for New Year, Sydney always comes out top.

'I started queuing at about 7am but there were a lot of people here since 5am. It's been fun.'

Below the gardens hundreds of boats of all sizes bobbed around in the harbour, with those lucky enough to be on board sure to have some of the best vantage points of all to watch the fireworks.

By just before 7pm, Sydney proved its popularity, with viewing spots around the Harbour, including Mrs Macquaries Point, East Circular Quay and Blues Point Reserve in North Sydney at capacity.

Most streets in Sydney's CBD were also shut down for the New Year's Eve celebration, while areas surrounding the harbour, including McMahons Point, Mosman and Potts Point were blocked.

NSW Police began breathalising people on boats in Sydney Harbour, as the vehicles jostle for the best position to view the fireworks. 

Jack Thompson, creative ambassador for Sydney's New Years Eve celebrations, said the theme for this year's New Years Eve was 'Inspire' and was perfectly suited. 

'This city itself is a muse,' Mr Thompson said.

'The muse is what inspires the artist, and this city has been a muse since it was established,' he said.
