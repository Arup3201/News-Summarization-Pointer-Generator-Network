No repeat of mistaken identity

Andre Marriner took charge of an Arsenal game for the first time since he wrongly sent off Kieran Gibbs instead of Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain when they played Chelsea in March. 

During that match Oxlade-Chamberlain tipped Eden Hazard’s shot around the post with his hand, but the referee had a nightmare and showed the red card to Gibbs instead. He apologised for the mistake afterwards.

Fortunately for Marriner, Gibbs started on the bench, so there was less chance of confusion.

Henry's wardrobe error

Arsenal legend Thierry Henry worried fans by wearing a ‘Spurs’ bobble hat soon after manager Arsene Wenger had hinted he would one day return to the club in some capacity.

A video emerged on Wednesday of the former striker – who spent eight years at the club – wearing the hat as he said goodbye to his team-mates in the dressing room after his final match for New York Red Bulls. Not to fear, Arsenal fans. Henry has not switched allegiance to their north London rivals, it was actually a hat for NBA team San Antonio Spurs.

Podolski frustration 

Outcast Lukas Podolski had to watch the start of the match from the bench again and will hold showdown talks with manager Arsene Wenger later this month. The Germany international is unhappy with his role in Wenger’s first-team plans and is open to leaving the club when the January transfer window opens. Podolski’s representatives plan to sit down with the Arsenal boss in the coming days to discuss his future.
