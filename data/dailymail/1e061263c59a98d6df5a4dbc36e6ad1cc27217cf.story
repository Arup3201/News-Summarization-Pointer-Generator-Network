A New York State Trooper is being called a hero for pulling an elderly man from certain death earlier this month after his car slammed into a gas pump.

John Vescio pulled the 69-year-old man from his car after he blacked out while exiting a suburban New York highway and plowed into the pump the off-duty officer was using. 

Dramatic video shows Vescio first running from what he thought would be a massive explosion before returning and saving the unidentified man’s life just before a massive fireball engulfed both their vehicles.

Hero: New York State Trooper John Vescio saved the driver's life

Inferno: this deadly fireball engulfed both vehicles shortly after the horror crash

‘It happened so quick,’ Vescio told the Journal News. ‘It was hard to think. I pretty much just reacted.’

Vescio, a senior investigator, was at a Hutchinson River Parkway gas station at 11.00 a.m. on June 3 in Westchester County when the man’s car careened off the highway.

The footage shows the teal sedan plow into the pump with such force it hits Vescio.

He immediately runs to safety, but then springs into action when he realizes the gravity of the situation after realizing the driver could not escape on his own. 

Moment of impact: Vescio is gassing up his car just as the blacked-out man's sedan slams into the pump

Dangerous: There is an initial explosion that Vescio steps back from

Mad dash: Vescio then sprints from the fire fearing for his life

‘I got the door open, but you could see that the actual compartment was compressed,’ Vescio said at a Tuesday press conference in Manhattan.

‘You could see the way his legs were tucked under by the seat, his seat belt was on, he was pretty much helpless,’ the heroic cop added.

Vescio remarkably runs back to the burning car and risks his own life to save that of a person he had never met before.

The selfless trooper struggles at first to get the driver out of the car, but is soon able to drag him to safety before returning to his own care for a first aid kit and his firearm.

A fireball engulfs the pump and both cars only seconds after the daring rescue.

Instinctual: Vescio's police training then kicks in and he runs back to the burning car to save the man's life

life saver: The man lived because Vescio dragged him to safety just before an even bigger explosion

‘I think John did a very heroic thing,’ said Keith Corlett. ‘He starts off as a civilian, he becomes a victim, and then his police training kicks in and he actually saved somebody’s life.’

Vescio suffered minor injuries in the ordeal, but shrugged them off to get his firearm safely from the inferno before pulling the driver from the wreck.

When asked if he feels like a hero, Vescio responded modestly.

‘I just feel like me, I get up every day and just do the right thing.’
