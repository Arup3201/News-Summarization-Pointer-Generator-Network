These are the prototypes of robots that may one day live among - even as our friends.

Developed in Bristol and Essex, they are being designed to rescue us, clear our sewers and become our companions.

Scientists even hope some of the humanoid designs will one day compete - and beat - humans in football matches.

In the palm of his hand: The iCub robot, modelled on a three-year-old child, is among a new generation of humanoids which are being designed in Bristol and Essex to performed complex tasks like humans

Apple of their eye: Ambitious scientists hope one day their robots will rescue us, become our friends and clear our sewers

Some can walk, talk and dance, speak 20 languages, hold conversations and respond with life-like expressions.

The BERT2 humanoid can interact with humans using an expressive face and artificial hands.

Theoretically, it could be controlled from anywhere in the world and so could be the forerunner of a robotic surgeon performing remote operations around the globe.

Others have been inspired by nature and can swim like fish or mimic the flight of birds and insects.

Mimicking nature: Robots like Jules (above) are covered in a synthetic skin to give a life-like appearance and can respond to humans with facial expressions much like our own

Blending in: Like Jules (left), Eve (right) is given a life-like face and hair to make them as authentic as possible

The Robotic Fish, which has the 'natural speed and motion of a large carp', can operate autonomously and is designed to monitor water pollution and detect leaks from ships in harbour.

Dr Ioannis Ieropoulos, senior researcher at the Bristol Robotic Laboratory, said the scientists had looked to nature for inspiration.

'Natural systems demonstrate perfectly that most of the difficult engineering problems have already been solved,' he said.

'By drawing inspiration from these living proofs we can achieve difficult tasks that would otherwise have been impossible.'

Treading the boards: The Robothespian, made by Engineered Arts Ltd of Cornwall, is a 'humanoid acting robot' which can be programmed to move like a human actor

Ingenious: Nao, a programmable humanoid robot built by French company Aldebaran Robotics (left), and BERT2 (right), which could eventually carry out surgical operations while being controlled anywhere in the world

Going swimmingly: The Robotic Fish (above) can operate autonomously and is designed to monitor water pollution and detect leaks from ships in harbour

Spy in the sky: Unmanned aerial vehicle developed by engineers at Essex University which could be used for reconnaissance or security

Flight of the future: Another design of unmanned aerial vehicle developed by engineers at Essex University

Life-savers: Robots like Shrewbot (above) have sensitive 'whiskers' which could be used to search pitch-black caves for rescue missions

Clever: SCRATCHbot is another touch-sensitive robot which could open a whole range of possibilities for its use

Industrial cleaning: The Ecobot III, a self-sustainable robot which can power itself by feeding off sewage water

I wanna be like you: A humanoid robot, featured with simple sensors and servomotors

Experts remain divided about whether true artificial intelligence can be obtained.

But scientists are certainly making good progress.

A series of tests has been suggested to determine whether the computer can equal the human mind and two have been successful:

Defeat the World Chess Champion (achieved)

Beat the world champions at TV general knowledge quiz show Jeopardy (achieved)

Successfully impersonate a human in online communications

Assimilate visual information as effectively as the human brain

One of his personal creations is the EcoBot III, which can power itself by 'feeding' on sewage water.

The water provides nutrients for the robot’s fuel cells and these generate electricity to power it.

This self-sustainability means it could eventually be programmed to roam along sewers, cleaning them as it goes.

Dr
Ieropoulos added: 'By looking at how animals in nature sustain 
themselves, a robot could be developed that is able to operate in 
hostile and lethal environments, providing a service to humankind.'

Others
like the Shrewbot and SCRATCHbot, which both have sensitive 'whiskers’,
could be used in rescue missions to search pitch-black caves.

The iCub - a 'robot youngster' 
modelled on a three-and-a-half year old child - is designed to give 
insight into how real humans develop and learn from their environment.

The Robothespian, made by Engineered Arts Ltd of Cornwall, is a 'humanoid acting robot’ which can be programmed to move like a human actor.

All around us: The scientists involved looked to nature for inspiration, where they say many engineering problems have already been solved

Bright sparks: Engineers working at the Bristol Robotics Laboratory, where many of these designs are being brought to reality

It uses facial-recognition software to mimic human movement and respond to faces.

One version speaks 20 different languages.

Unmanned aerial vehicles mimic the flight and hovering capabilities of birds and insects.

They are already used by the military but could also enter civilian life as scouts for search and rescue missions.

Nao is a robot that can walk, talk, dance and respond to human speech. They have spent time in paediatric wards, where it gives advice and support to young patients with chronic illnesses like diabetes.

Jules and Eve are humanoid heads, which are able to talk and respond to people with human-like facial expressions.

They are covered in a synthetic skin for a lifelike appearance.
