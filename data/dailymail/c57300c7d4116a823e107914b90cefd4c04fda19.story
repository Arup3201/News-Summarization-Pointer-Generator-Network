The woman who received a flood of insulting messages after fumbling the first question on a television quiz show said the experience has motivated her to spread awareness about cyber bullying.

On Wednesday evening, Whitney Beseler, a PE teacher from Balllarat in Victoria, botched the first question on Millionaire Hot Seat live on air.

For the hundred dollar introductory question, host Eddie McGuire asked Beseler which of the following-an engagement ring, an anniversary ring, a wedding ring or a burger ring- was 'not a piece of jewellery worn to symbolise a relationship between two people.'

When Beseler assuredly locked in ‘anniversary ring’-suggesting that burger rings were a form of romantic jewellery-the rest was history. 

The clip spread like wildfire, reaching mainstream media outlets across the globe and prompting a flood messages sent to Beseler on social media. But many of these were less than flattering.

‘There were some really horrible messages. People attacked me about being blonde, about being female,' Beseler told Daily Mail Australia.

'I was even lambasted on my ability as a teacher. It’s lucky I have a thick skin, but it has really opened my eyes,’ she said.

When explaining her notorious blunder, Beseler said it was a simple case of a mental lapse.

‘It was a just a brain fart, everyone has them, it just happened that mine was on live television,’ she said.

Beseler believes it is the internet culture of trolling that gives rise to the hurtful messages.

‘I think when people are sitting behind a keyboard and hurling abuse, they don’t understand they are speaking to humans with feelings. It has been a real learning curve for me.’

The Ballarat teacher said she wants to use the experience to educate people about cyber bullying.

‘I had a lightbulb moment, and decided to turn the negative into a positive. I am looking at starting a schooling program to educate kids about the severity of online bullying.’ 

‘It’s scary that this is happening to people every day. I’m not letting it affect me, but I think it’s a really serious issue that needs to be addressed,' she said.

‘If it happened to someone more sensitive, you never know what could happen.’
