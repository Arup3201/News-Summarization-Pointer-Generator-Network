Dramatic plans: Heiress Fawn James wants to turn one of her father's lap-dancing clubs into a theatre

Five years ago she inherited a 60-acre property and publishing empire in the heart of London, including, of course, the site of Britain’s first-ever strip club, the Revuebar.

But now, as a film starring Steve Coogan as ‘King of Soho’ porn baron Paul Raymond is launched, his gamine granddaughter Fawn James, 27, is turning her back on the girlie shows on which her fortune was based in favour of serious theatre. 

Fawn, who with her younger sister India Rose inherited a vast chunk of the red-light area, will next month ask Westminster Council  for ‘a change of use’ for a table-dancing club she owns above the infamous former Revuebar, which is now the home of the louche Box nightclub, much loved by the young royals.

Fawn plans to kick out the lap-dancers and create a new, 120-seat theatre which, I can reveal, she will manage herself.

‘I am really excited about it,’ says Fawn who has ambitions to become an actress. Last year, she took a course at the Lee Strasberg Institute of Film in Los Angeles and has since appeared in a play called Riot Night about the summer riots of 2011.

Her grandfather opened the Revuebar in Walkers Court in 1958. The club upstairs was previously the Boulevard Theatre, which launched the careers of many comedians in the Eighties.

Fawn tells me: ‘The Boulevard was the platform for the Comic Strip, Eddie Izzard and Steve Coogan. It’s our intention to introduce this space as an off-Broadway style fringe theatre in the heart of the West End.'

The table-dancing club above the former Revuebar could be about to undergo a major change of entertainment

She wants her new theatre to showcase up-and-coming young playwrights and directors and I am told: ‘Fawn is going to manage the venue herself, although it may be in partnership with someone else who will be artistic director.’

She has, meanwhile, acquired an agent, Kenneth Earle, to help pursue her acting career and she will be performing in the West End chorus for The Night Of 1,000 Stars at the Royal Albert Hall on May 5.

Fawn, who shares her life with Nottingham University graduate Nick Lawson, whom she met backpacking in Thailand, is planning to overhaul Walkers Court, cleaning up the facades of the buildings and improving the lighting and paving. 

Work will begin as soon as she gets planning permission.
