Attack: Anton Bailey said he was surrounded by French fishing boats in international waters

A British fisherman today claimed that his boat was attacked by crew on a rival French vessel - who pelted his boat with rocks and fired flares at it - in a dispute over lucrative scallop beds.

Anton Bailey said he was surrounded by French fishing boats in international waters off the coast of Le Havre in Normandy, France, and claimed one of the vessels even tried to ram his trawler.

Mr Bailey, of Brixham, Devon, said: ‘They were just trying to stop us from our fishing activity. They were shooting flares at other vessels, every underhanded thing you could think of.

'Then they threw rocks at us and tried to ram us. I've never seen this before and I have been at sea 20 years.’

A Maritime and Coastguard Agency spokesman confirmed an incident where ‘British fishing vessels were being confronted by French fishing vessels’ had been reported to the organisation.

She said: ‘We contacted the French Coastguard who sent a French patrol vessel to the area. The French authorities are continuing to monitor the situation, which we now believe has been resolved.’

The spokesman said the agency had received no further reports of trouble since Monday’s incident.

Jim Portus, from the South Western Fish 
Producers Organisation, said it was not the first time such an attack 
had happened in the waters where British and French fisherman fish for 
scallops.

‘The French have a self-imposed closed season for the five months ending on 1 October,’ he added.

‘Their fishermen weren’t exploiting the beds over the summer, but the British fishermen were this summer and have done in the past. Irish boats do too. It causes friction.’

French fishermen have blamed overfishing in waters north of the Normandy area on British trawlers who don't follow this summer closed season.

The Marine Management Organisation confirmed a number of UK vessels were in an area where they were allowed to fish at the time, adding that many French vessels were in close proximity.
