The Los Angeles-based Actor began his career in Japan as a series regular acting in the Japanese superhero TV series 'B- FighterKabuto.' 

He later relocated to Hong Kong to work alongside the most recognizable names in action, including Jackie Chan and Sammo Hung. 

Eventually he made his way to Hollywood and worked regularly as an actor and stuntman on the international hit show 'The Power Rangers.'

His motion capture performances have made it to the big screen in Steven Spielberg's and Peter Jackson's, The Adventures of Tintin, and James Cameron's Avatar, while he starred in the computer games Resident Evil and Devil May Cry.

However, unlike Andy Serkis, who played Gollum in the Lord of the Rings trilogy and has become synonymous with  motion capture, Langdon has remained unseen.

'Just think of it as the evolution of makeup,' he told Grantland.

He also revealed that working on computer games was usually more fraught than working on films. 

'Usually the video-game guys are more secretive than the movie guys,' he said. 

Langdon's first motion capture  job was for a game called Resident Evil: Code Veronica for the now-defunct Sega system Dreamcast.

To capture his moves, a system called magnetic capture was used.

Performers wore a suit covered with receivers that were connected by wire to a central transmitter, which created data by measuring the distance between it and the receivers. 

The transmitter was basically a giant radio, blasting powerful frequencies to everyone in range.

Langdon has worked with dozens of different motion capture systems

One of his most impressive roles is in the zombie 'movie' game The Last of Us, one of the most innovative games ever made.

'We could only be in the room for two or three hours,' Langdon said. 

'You'd feel like someone punched you in the face, or like you just woke up.'
