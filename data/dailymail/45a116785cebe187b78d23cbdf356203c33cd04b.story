Miss McDonald said she was ‘absolutely not guilty’ when asked to enter a plea, but otherwise spoke only to confirm her name, address and date of birth.

Miss Regan also pleaded not guilty, and both women were granted unconditional bail.

The case has been adjourned to Bradford Crown Court on Wednesday May 21.
