The dramatic announcement that Italy’s top criminal court seeks to retry American Amanda Knox for the murder of her British roommate sparks a heated legal debate that raises questions of double jeopardy.

The U.S. constitution bans double jeopardy, or being tried twice for the same crime; however, Italy’s courts have no such law, meaning that they will use the same evidence to try the 25-year-old for the 2007 murder of Meredith Kercher.

Legal experts say Italy’s Supreme Court decision could throw both countries into uncharted territory, as it is highly unlikely the U.S. will extradite Knox to face trial.

Extradited? Amanda Knox, pictured in 2011 at Sea-Tac International Airport, is unlikely to ever return to Italy after the country's top court ordered a retrial in the murder of Meredith Kercher

Statement: Knox, pictured in Italian court in 2011, released a statement saying she and her family would remain 'confident in the truth and with our heads held high in the face of wrongful accusations and unreasonable adversity'

Overturned: Italy's Court of Cassation, in Rome, overturned its original ruling and is seeking a retrial; the U.S. Constitution bans double jeopardy, or a second trial for the same crime

Knox’s Italian lawyer, Carlo Dalla Vedova, said it was unlikely that his client does not intend to return to Italy to face trial, which would likely take place this year or next. However, Knox can be tried in absentia.

‘Amanda does not intend to come back for the retrial,' he said. 'Her home is in 
Seattle and she doesn’t need to be here.’

He added that the decision to order a 
new trial was shocking. ‘She thought that the nightmare was over,’ he 
said on the steps of the courthouse. ‘But she’s ready to fight.’

When the Italian courts reach a final decision they can also ask for her extradition, the lawyer told Reuters. At that point, the U.S. Department of State would have to weigh in on the request and make its own decision. The state department would then turn to the U.S. Attorney’s Office to seek the Seattle resident’s extradition.

A State Department official told MailOnline that the matter is currently in the jurisdiction of the Italian courts. 'As such,' the spokesperson said, 'the State Department will refrain from making any further comment.'

Retrial: Amanda Knox holds hands with her boyfriend James Terrano in downtown Seattle on Sunday. She spoken of her anguish after Italy's highest criminal court overturned her acquittal for the murder of British student Meredith Kercher

Questions: Meredith Kercher's sister Stephanie Kercher, 29,  left, said at her family's home in Coulsdon, Surrey, said: 'There are a lot of unanswered questions still'. Right, her sister before her 2007 death

Regardless of the outcome, the new trial will prove to be an expensive and emotionally-charged spectacle.

After the court’s decision, the 
attractive brunette struck back. ‘No matter what happens, my family and I
will face this continuing legal battle as we always have, confident in 
the truth and with our heads held high in the face of wrongful 
accusations and unreasonable adversity,’ she said in a statement.

The 25-year-old has largely avoided 
the public eye since returning to Seattle, Washington, and has been 
spotted around the town running errands and resuming her studies.

Her memoir, ‘Waiting to be Heard,’ is due out in April.

Meredith Kercher, 21, a Leeds 
University student, was found semi-naked with her throat cut in the 
bedroom of the house she shared with Knox, in Perugia in November 2007.

The first trial caused a stir as both
Knox and Sollicito were acquitted of Kercher’s murder, and a polarizing
divide in national thought – Americans largely understood the two to be
innocent, while the British believed them to be getting away with 
murder.

The initial trial also put Knox’s 
character in the forefront as prosecutors painted the brunette American 
student as a sexual deviant who experimented with marijuana.

But in 2011, the evidence was re-visited and much of it was found to be ‘contaminated.’

Meredith's sister Stephanie and mother Arline welcomed the news about the retrial on Tuesday

Jailed: Knox, 25, and Sollecito, 29, spent four years in jail, but were freed on appeal in 2011 largely on the grounds DNA evidence was flawed

Knox and Sollecito spoke on the phone 
soon after yesterday’s verdict. Sollecito’s current girlfriend Annie 
Achille said: ‘They will see what can be done.’

She added that her 
boyfriend, who turned 29 yesterday, is ‘destroyed’ and not talking to 
anyone.

Meredith Kercher, from Coulsdon, 
Surrey, was in Italy as an exchange student from Leeds University.

She 
was found dead in 2007, in the cottage she shared with Knox in the 
picturesque hilltop town of Perugia.

Her throat had been slit and her 
semi-naked body had been covered with a duvet. After a lengthy trial in 
Perugia, Knox and Sollecito were convicted of the murder in December 
2009 and sentenced to 26 and 25 years respectively.

But two years later, the pair were 
freed after an appeal court found that the case had been botched and DNA
evidence contaminated.

A third suspect, Rudy Guede, whose DNA
and bloody footprints were found all over the crime scene, is serving a
16-year prison sentence, reduced from 30 years on appeal.

Meredith’s family welcomed yesterday’s
judgment. Her sister Stephanie said: ‘We are never going to be happy 
about any outcome because we have still lost Meredith but we obviously 
support the decision and hope to get answers from it.

There are still so
many unanswered questions. All we have ever wanted to do is do what we 
can for Meredith and to find out the truth of what happened that night.’

Knox had rejoiced after her conviction
was sensationally overturned in 2011.

She fled Italy within hours, 
returning home to the US, where she quickly embraced life as a free 
woman. She now shares a flat with boyfriend James Terrano, a classical 
guitarist, and is studying at the University of Washington in Seattle, 
where she can be near her parents and three sisters.

The former student is preparing for 
the publication next month of  a memoir for which she has been paid a 
reported $3.8million.

Sollecito remained in Italy and is studying 
robotic surgery at the University of Verona. He has already released a 
book about his experience. In it he said that he and Knox were still in 
touch – he visited her earlier this year and they speak on Skype 
regularly.

Sollecito’s lawyer Giulia Bongiorno said: ‘We are still strong. This is not a sentence in itself: this is just an annulment.’

Knox’s appeal against her conviction 
for slander – for having falsely accused her boss Patrick Lumumba of the
murder – was rejected. She has already served the three-year prison 
sentence for that conviction, but was ordered to pay Lumumba €4,000 ($5,100) in 
costs.

The retrial will be held in Florence, with different judges, to avoid accusations of prejudice against the accused pair.

Amanda Knox and Raffaele Sollecito were seen kissing in the wake of the murder

Rudy Guede was identified by police after his bloody fingerprint was found on a cushion at the scene of the crime.

The
21-year-old Ivory Coast national had given his fingerprints when he 
applied for an Italian identity card several years earlier.

He was known to police as a petty thief and small time drug dealer.

Guede
had arrived in Italy in 1992 as a five year-old child with his father 
Roger, who left his wife behind in west Africa to seek work in Italy 
where he had a sister.

But
when Guede was 15 Roger went back to Africa, leaving his son behind in 
the care of, remarkably, a multi-millionaire Paolo Caporali who had 
occasionally employed the boy in odd jobs.

In
the summer of 2007, Guede rented a flat in the centre of Perugia and 
became friendly with four male students who lived in the flat below Miss
Kercher and Knox.

In 
September and October Guede was linked to three break-ins - two in 
Perugia and one in Milan. He also carried out another break-in at the 
offices of a local lawyer in Perugia and at the end of October he was 
arrested in Milan after breaking into a school.

Following the murder he fled Perugia and went to Germany on a train. He was arrested there and extradited back to Italy.

In
October 2008 he was sentenced to 30 years in jail for the murder and 
sexual assault of Miss Kercher after opting for a fast-track trial.

The day before his arrest on suspicion of Meredith Kercher's murder, Patrick Lumumba had been handing out flyers publicising a candlelit vigil in her memory.

Mr Lumumba, a well-known and popular figure in Perugia for a decade, 
was born in the Democratic Republic of Congo.

He is believed to be 
related to murdered Congolese prime minister Patrice Lumumba.

He arrived
in Italy legally in 1988.

Married with a young child, he opened a
bar and restaurant called Le Chic on a narrow street in Perugia town 
centre in August 2007.

The same month that Miss Kercher arrived to begin a 
short Italian course.

He employed her housemate Amanda Knox to help him with promotional work, before firing her for flirting with customers.

He believes Knox took her revenge by framing him for Miss Kercher's murder.

Mr
Lumumba was arrested on suspicion of causing her death on November 6.

He spent two weeks in prison before being able to prove that he spent 
the night of the killing talking to a customer in his pub.

In 2009  he sued Knox for wrongly accusing him of the crime.
