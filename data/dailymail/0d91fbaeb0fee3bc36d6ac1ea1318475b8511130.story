A top businessman has said he would rather hire talented graduates with 2:2s and thirds, than 'weirdos' with first-class degrees.

Rory Sutherland, vice president of leading marketing and communications company Ogilvy Group UK, said there was no evidence that those with the top class degrees made better employees, but often the reverse was true.

In a slightly tongue in cheek column for the Spectator, he said: 'We could simply place ads in student newspapers: "Headed for a 2:2 or a third? Finish your joint and come and work for us."'

Mr Sutherland, who graduated from Cambridge with a 2:2 in classics, argues that often people with mediocre degrees actually turn into better employees.

He told the Sunday Times: 'If you're at university and you're surrounded by the opposite sex, drink, drugs and parties and general entertainment and you decide to sit in your room reading Thucydides, then you're probably a bit of weirdo.'

JK Rowling, author of the hugely popular Harry Potter books, graduated with a 2:2 in French and German from the University of Exeter, and actor Hugh Laurie failed to graduate at all.

Professor Lord Robert Winston, one of the world's most respected medical academics, said those that have fallen short of academic brilliance are often better employees because they are more rounded individuals

It comes after fertility expert Robert Winston said those that have fallen short of academic brilliance are often better employees because they are more rounded individuals who work well in a team.

The Labour Peer said: ‘I know scientists who are amazingly stupid,’ he said.

‘And in my laboratory I have appointed scientists on the whole that didn’t get first-class honours degrees, deliberately, quite specifically, because, actually, I would rather have young people around me who developed other interests at university and didn’t just focus entirely on getting that first.

‘That’s been a very successful strategy. It’s produced a lot of useful science because we’ve worked as a group of friends, a team. That’s very much more important than almost anything else.’
