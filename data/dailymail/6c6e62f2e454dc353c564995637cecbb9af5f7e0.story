Lloyds chief executive Antonio Horta-Osorio (pictured with his wife Ana) was handed a £1.49million bonus

Taxpayers are in line to lose £12.4billion on their emergency bailouts of Lloyds and Royal Bank of Scotland, it emerged last night.

The hidden costs, incurred because Labour paid too much for shares in the banks in 2008, were written off and buried in Budget documents in 2010.

But they were unearthed yesterday by Treasury officials as Lloyds indicated it is likely to start offloading the taxpayer’s 39 per cent stake when the bank’s share price, currently 53p, hits 61p.

The 61p target is viewed as the ‘break even’ point at which Lloyds shares can be sold without incurring further loss. The ‘break-even’ figure for RBS is around 400p.

However, Gordon Brown’s government pumped in £66billion of public money to bail out the two banks and paid over the market value for them to the tune of £12.4billion.

This secret write-off came in 2010 a few weeks before the Coalition came to power.

The write-off emerged as a fresh £1.5billion charge for mis-selling payment protection insurance prompted Lloyds to post its fifth straight year of huge losses.

The bank also came under fire for dishing out a £1.49million bonus to chief executive Antonio Horta-Osorio.

Lloyds chairman Sir Win Bischoff insisted it was showing ‘restraint’, an echo of Downing Street’s defence of RBS on Wednesday when that bank announced losses of £5billion – and £600million of bonuses for staff.

Mr Horta-Osorio said he was ‘confident’ the state-backed lender could be sold back to the private sector at a profit.

The £12.4billion write-off covers the £3.6billion on Lloyds and £8.8billion on RBS incurred in the initial bailout. This means taxpayers will in reality break even only if shares in the two banks are sold at the inflated price at which they were bought by Gordon Brown.

Matthew Sinclair, of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘It seems increasingly doubtful taxpayers will get back the billions they pumped into these failing institutions.’

Losses at Lloyds, which received a £20billion bailout in 2008, narrowed to £570million last year, down from £3.5billion in 2011.

But despite the bank remaining in the red for a fifth year it awarded the bonus in deferred shares to Mr Horta-Osorio.

He will only receive the award if the share price hits 73.6p for a sustained period or the Government had sold at least a third of its stake for the lower price of 61p.

Lloyds also paid out £365million in bonuses, a 3 per cent drop from last year.

Sir Win said the bank ‘continues to show restraint’ but that ‘employees should be rewarded for their contribution to the further strengthening of the business in 2012’.

Labour’s John Mann, of the Treasury Select Committee, said: ‘This is an amazing waste of taxpayers’ money and sends the message we reward failure. It’s the same story – when will we ever learn.’

Insiders insisted the Treasury had never set a target price at which it would start selling shares in Lloyds and RBS.
