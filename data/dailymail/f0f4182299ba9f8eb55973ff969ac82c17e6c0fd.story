Patirck Cau will pay $250,000 as part of a plea deal and could face up to five years in prison

A former United Airlines flight attendant who made phony bomb threats against jetliners has been sentenced to 18 months in federal prison.

Patrick Cau, who also uses the name Patrick Kaiser, was sentenced on Monday by a federal judge in Los Angeles.

Cau pleaded guilty earlier this year to one count of false information and hoaxes. In the plea agreement, Cau said he used pay phones in several cities to make eight threats against United flights between October 2012 and January.

The German national who now lives in Dallas was also ordered to pay more than $300,000 to United and to Los Angeles police as restitution because flights were delayed, canceled, evacuated or searched.

At least six of the eight calls were made in relation to flights from Los Angeles to London.

United Airlines lost $268,000 in canceled and delayed flights due to the bogus threats.

He now faces a prison sentence of up to five years and has agreed to pay $304,495 as part of his plea deal.

Mr
Cau passed American Airlines' background check when he was hired. He 
was later discovered to use the name Patrick Kaiser, which was used on

United Airlines confirmed that he was 
previously employed by the company, but could not provide further 
details as to why his employment ended.
