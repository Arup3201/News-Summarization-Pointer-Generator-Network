'It's always something with him': Debra Tate, sister of slain actress Sharon Tate, speaks during a 2009 parole hearing for Manson follower Susan Atkins 

The sister of Manson family victim Sharon Tate has denounced cult leader Charles Manson's prospective marriage to a 26-year-old fan as 'ludicrous' and 'insane'.

Debra Tate, whose pregnant sister was slain in 1969 by Manson's murderous followers, has spent much of her life trying to divert attention from the cult leader and keep him in prison.

Her job has got more difficult however with the news that the 80-year-old has been granted a marriage license to wed Afton Elaine Burton, who moved from the Midwest to California nine years ago to be near him.

'It's always something with him,' she said.

Ms Tate's comments came as prison officials told TMZ that Manson will be allowed to kiss his bride on their wedding day for as long as they want, but warders will step in if the couple become too intimate.

Manson will reportedly not be restrained during the ceremony but he won't be allowed physical contact with Miss Burton beyond holding hands and locking lips during the ceremony.

Manson must be in his prison scrubs as dressing up in a morning suit or tuxedo is forbidden, but Miss Burton can wear whatever she likes. Catering will be from prison vending machines.

Ms Tate said Manson's bride-to-be, known as 'Star,' seems to believe the killer is leading a movement to save the environment.

Its name, ATWA — which stands for air, trees, water, animals — was emblazoned on a T-shirt worn by Miss Burton when The Associated Press interviewed her on Monday.

'I wonder how long it will take for her to figure out this is just a con,' Ms Tate said. 'It makes me wonder what is missing in her life that she would want to marry an 80-year-old man. Is she a victim? Is she mentally deranged?'

Miss Burton has said she loves Manson and wants to help exonerate him. Marrying him would provide access to information denied to non-relatives, she said without elaborating.

She left her home in the Midwest to move near Manson's prison in Corcoran, California, nine years ago. She runs several websites maintaining the killer's innocence.

Tate, 62, recently published a coffee table book about her sister.

'There are no M words in the book. No Manson, no murder,' Tate said Tuesday. 'It's a celebration of Sharon's life, her fashion sense, her physical beauty and her spirit.'

With an introduction by Sharon's widower, director Roman Polanski, the book is titled Sharon Tate Recollection.

Sharon Tate was 26 and more than eight months pregnant when she was killed with four other people. The next night, grocers Leno and Rosemary La Bianca were stabbed to death across town.

Manson later stood trial with Susan Atkins, Patricia Krenwinkel and Leslie Van Houten. All were sentenced to death as was a fifth killer, Charles 'Tex' Watson. When the death penalty was outlawed briefly in 1972, their sentences were commuted to life in prison.

A self-imposed purgatory followed for the Tate family. Her mother and two sisters committed themselves to attending every parole hearing for every Manson family member to argue against their release.

Debra Tate is one of the few people still alive to carry on that cause. Foremost in her mind is preventing the spread of Manson's internet following.

'I don't want any more heinous actions by another family like his because of something I didn't do,' she said.

The Kings County marriage license, viewed on Monday by The Associated Press, was granted on November 7 for Manson and Miss Burton. The license does not specify a wedding date and indicates the couple has 90 days to get married or they will have to reapply.

Miss Burton told the AP that she and Manson will be married next month.

'Y'all can know that it's true,' she said. 'It's going to happen.'

'I love him,' she added. 'I'm with him. There's all kinds of things.'

California Department of Corrections spokeswoman Terry Thornton confirmed  that the license had been transmitted to the prison.

Ms Thornton said each California prison designates an employee to be a marriage coordinator who processes paperwork for an inmate's request to be wed.

In most cases, she said, the department of corrections approves of such weddings as 'a tool of family reunification and social development.' But Manson's case is difficult.

Miss Burton said the wedding might have happened earlier if Manson did not have 'some situations' at the prison.

Ms Thornton explained that in February, Manson had three violations for possession of a weapon, threatening staff and refusal to provide a urine sample.

Further details on the violations were not immediately available.

Miss Burton said the prison holds marriages on the first Saturday of each month. She expects to be married in an inmate visiting room at the prison.

Ms Thornton confirmed that Manson can have a wedding at the prison and invite an officiate from outside the prison to perform the ceremony.

He and his prospective spouse also would be allowed to invite 10 guests who are not inmates.

Manson's life was one of crime even before he became the 20th Century's most notorious serial killer. He was born Charles Miles Maddox to a 16-year-old girl during the Great Depression on November 12, 1934, in Cincinnati, Ohio.

He was abandoned by his mother and father before ending up living on the streets, where he began to steal cars, write fraudulent checks and became involved in prostitution. By the time his followers committed their gruesome murders that shocked the world in 1969, Manson had already spent half his life in prison.
