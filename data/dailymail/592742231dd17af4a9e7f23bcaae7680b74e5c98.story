The wait is finally over for disgruntled car owner  Ashton Wood who has said goodbye to the most hated possession he has ever owned - his Jeep Chrysler.

Years of campaigning the car manufacturer to refund or replace his 'lemon' car - he bought from a Sunshine Coast dealer - proved fruitless, so the Queenslander decided to employ a different strategy to get the message across.

He invited the public along to a rural property, at Bli Bli an hour north of Brisbane, where 300 people watched and took part in the car's demolition derby by wielding bats, and sledgehammers and shooting bow and arrows at it.

The wait is finally over for disgruntled car owner Ashton Wood who has said goodbye to his Jeep Cherokee

Years of campaigning the car manufacturer did no good so he smashed it to smithereens

Mr Wood still owed $29,000 in total, so he was out of pocket close to $10,000 before smashing his Jeep to smitherines

This is the feeling of satisfaction according to Mr Wood 

Saturday's momentous comes four years after Mr Wood bought the 'lemon' car for $49,000 and months after he started planning the demolition derby.

Saturday's momentous occasion comes four years after Mr Wood bought the 'lemon' car for $49,000 and months after he started planning the demolition event.

He said his feeling of satisfaction could not have felt sweeter: 'It's fantastic, I'm here celebrating at the pub eating chicken wings.

Mr Wood took the extreme measure to destroy his car - using augers, crow bars, bow and arrows and sheer man power - after years of frustration with his 'cursed' Jeep Cherokee.

The footage was streamed live on the internet capturing the varied moments people took to help bring the car to its knees.

After the car was destroyed a fire was lit to bring the rubble to nothing but scrap metal

The left over parts of the car were buried beneath the ground 

For four hours they shot arrows at it, sledged windows and tore tyres while an auger ripped through its roof lifting it off the ground.

'The car was spinning in the air with the auger through the top of the roof,' Mr Wood said. 

'The whole car lifted two, maybe three foot off the ground before we crushed it and lit on fire.'

He said the 'Pièce de résistance' was putting a flame to it and watching it burn before burying the scrap heap and laying flowers at the head of its makeshift burial plot.

'We buried it six feet under, where it belongs.'

Mr Wood started an online kick-starter campaign to recoup the losses on his $50,000 vehicle.

He raised $18,000 through the crowd-funded project for people to bid on parts of the car they wanted to smash to smithereens.

After four years of repayments he still owed $29,000 in total, so he was out of pocket close to $10,000, but by Saturday that no longer mattered.

Baseball bats, arrows and sledgehammers were used in the very public destruction

More than 300 people turned out to either witness the public smashing or to take part in it

Part of the grill of the car finally comes unstuck in the demolition derby 

The main impetus behind the idea was to raise awareness around 'lemon laws' and to try to stop big companies from selling cars that should never be put on the road.

'The serious side to it is that I shouldn't have had to destroy a $50,000 car,' he said.

'If the law was there today and if Chrysler group respected and looked after its customers then it wouldn't have had to happen.' 

Mr Wood said plenty more jeep owners that have come forward with complaints that they are taking to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission. 

A Tasmanian, who won a bid for the scrap heap on Ebay where he bough the metallic wreck for $257, was given the choice of what to do with the heap so he decided to 'bury the bastard.'

In the four years since Mr Wood bought the car, in 2010, he claims it has provided him all sorts of problems, including the fuel line falling off, coolant leaks, the rear strut leaking oil, ongoing ignition failure, and the turbo inlet manifold cracking.

Chrysler offered Mr Wood a settlement of $22,500 for the car, for which he originally paid $49,000, and he knows that if he sold the car himself he could get $28,000 for it, but he said he felt uncomfortable with both options.

'Why would I have wanted to sell it on to someone else?' They'll just have the same problems.'

Now that the destruction of the Jeep has taken place, Mr Wood says he just wants to put this chapter behind him. 

He will have to buy a replacement car and while he is not certain which model he'll purchase he does know one thing.

'It won't be a Jeep.'
