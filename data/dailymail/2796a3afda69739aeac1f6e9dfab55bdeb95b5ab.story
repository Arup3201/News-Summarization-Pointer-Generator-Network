Fewer families are taking holidays during term time in the wake of a government crackdown on absenteeism, new figures suggest.

The number of days missed by holidaying pupils decreased by almost a third in the past year after a ban on taking children out of lessons for trips.

Parents have been fined up to £1,000 and even taken to court since the new policy came into force in September 2013.

Drop: Figures reveal just 3million school days were missed by pupils last year - down 1.4million on 2012-13

Yesterday, Department for Education figures showed 3million days were missed for holidays in 2013-14, down from 4.4million in 2012-13.

The latest figure represents a decrease of more than two fifths from 2009-10, when 5.3million days were missed.

Government statisticians said the drop has been fuelled by a fall in the number of authorised breaks - trips approved by the school.

There has been a slight rise in the number of unauthorised holidays - indicating that some parents may be deciding to take their child out of school without permission, and instead run the risk of a fine.

The latest figures, for the last academic year, are the first to show the impact of strict new rules on pupil absence introduced by former education secretary Michael Gove.

Under the changes, heads are now only able to grant leave in ‘exceptional circumstances’ and parents can be fined £60 per pupil for taking term time holidays without permission.

The cost rises to £120 if it is not paid within 21 days.

Fines: The drop is being credited on the new fines system, which sees parents landed with a £60 penalty if they take their children out of school for an 'unauthorised' absence

Those who fail to pay can face prosecution, with a maximum fine, if convicted, of £2,500 or a jail sentence of up to three months.

The National Association of Head Teachers released guidance stating exceptions could be made for family funerals and religious events, but family holidays were unlikely to meet the criterion.

Campaigners have said the rules impact the hardest on poorer families who cannot afford high travel costs during school breaks, and families with parents that work shifts on or rosters.

Travel companies increase their prices significantly in peak seasons when there is more demand.

School Reform Minister Nick Gibb said: ‘Every single lost day counts - which is why as part of our plan for education we have put teachers back in charge so they can clamp down on classroom absence.

‘Fewer school days are being lost than ever before thanks to our reforms - giving children the best possible chance to succeed.’
