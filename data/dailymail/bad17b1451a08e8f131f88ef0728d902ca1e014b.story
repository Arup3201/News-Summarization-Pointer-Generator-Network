Ivan Rakitic hit the beach with his wife to prepare for a crucial week in Barcelona’s season as Luis Enrique’ side pursues a treble.

The La Liga leaders face Manchester City in the Champions League last 16 second-leg, having won the first-leg 2-1 last month, before hosting Real Madrid in El Clasico on Sunday.

Rakitic has become an integral part of the Barcelona midfield ranks since joining from Sevilla last summer, making 36 appearances so far this season for the Catalan giants.

The Croatian international posted a sunny snap on his Instagram with his Spanish wife Raquel Mauri ahead of the Manchester City clash with the caption ‘familiar Sunday’.

Seemingly Rakitic is a regular on Barcelona’s beach but it’s not all leisure for the Croatian, having posted another picture on his Instagram account on Sunday from the team gym as he prepares for a ‘big week’.

Luis Enrique’s side remained top of La Liga on Saturday with a 2-0 victory at Eibar, courtesy of a brace from Lionel Messi.

Enrique is hoping to lead Barcelona to a treble, having reached the Copa del Rey final, the Champions League knockout stages and are currently leading La Liga.
