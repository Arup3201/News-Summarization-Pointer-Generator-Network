A laboratory analysis performed by the FDA confirmed OxyELITE contains fluoxetine, also known under the brand name Prozac. 

Fuoxetine is in a class of drugs called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). 

They are used for treating depression, bulimia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, panic disorder and premenstrual dysphonic disorder.

SSIRs are approved by the FDA.

According to the agency: 'Uses of SSRIs have been associated with serious side effects including suicidal thinking, abnormal bleeding, and seizures. 

'In patients on other medications for common conditions ventricular arrhythmia or sudden death can occur.'

The average price for a bottle of the supplement is $35.99, according to its website. 

Benefits of the product include sustained weight loss, suppressed appetite, sharper mental focus and a 'strong yet smooth' boost in energy.

The FDA has had issues with USPlabs in the past. 

In 2013, the company was linked 'to dozens of cases of acute liver failure and hepatitis, including one death and illnesses so severe that several patients required liver transplants'.

After the FDA, Centers for Disease Control Prevention and other agencies were able to link the health problems with use of an OxyElite Pro supplement, USPlabs eventually recalled the product.

Warehouse supplies of the supplement with a retail value of about $22million were destroyed.

Earlier that year, another version of OxyElite Pro was destroyed after it was found to contain DMAA, or dimethylamylamine, according to the FDA. 

The director of the FDA's Division of Dietary Supplement Programs, Daniel Fabricant, said: 'Twice in a short period, this company has added new dietary ingredients to supplements without notifying the FDA and providing a reasonable expectation of safety, as required by law.

'Losses to the company should also serve as a reminder that FDA's laws and regulations serve a purpose and must be followed.'

The FDA said it is 'unable to test and identify all products marketed as dietary supplements that have potentially harmful hidden ingredients.'

USPlabs claims the supplement which was tested by the FDA was a counterfeit.  

After the FDA's report, the company 'immediately conducted an investigation and determined that the product shown in the Public Notification and tested by FDA was not manufactured or distributed by or for the Company. 

'It is a counterfeit. 

'Neither USPlabs nor its contract manufacturers has ever ordered or in any way handled fluoxetine for any purpose of any kind.

'The Company has encountered counterfeit versions of its dietary supplement products in the past, and has reported these problems to FDA as well as to State and other Federal officials. 

'USPlabs has offered to work with the FDA to help prevent the distribution of counterfeit versions of its dietary supplement products.'
