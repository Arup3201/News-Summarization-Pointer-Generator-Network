Andy Murray's golden dream of history-making double grand slam titles is over after a four set loss to Serbia's Novak Djokovic.

The world number one rallied from a first set defeat to overcome the Briton in the Australian Open. Murray earlier came through some nervy moments to claim the first set of his Australian Open final against Djokovic in a tie-break.

But Djokovic put the match back to level in the second set and then triumphed in the third and fourth.

The champions were initially evenly-matched, steadily trading blows in a series of long rallies, but Murray began to falter immediately after the Serbian drew level.

The British number one would have created 
history if he had triumphed in Melbourne as no male player in the Open 
era has followed up winning their first grand slam title by also winning
the next available major crown.

Murray,
25, was the first Briton to reach three Australian Open finals
after winning a five-set thriller against Roger Federer on Friday.

However, Djokovic has the upper hand in their head-to-head record - with the Serbian now having won 11 of their 18 meetings, including the final of the competition in 2011.

A clearly emotional Murray was gracious in defeat, saying on court: 'Firstly obviously, I'd like to congratulate Novak. His record here is incredible.

'I'd also like to thank my team. They've done a great job with me and they help me all the time.

'I'd also like to thank the whole crowd, there's such a great atmosphere to play in and you're all very fair, so thank you very much.'

He added: 'I'll see you guys next year. Thank you.'

Both players produced superb service games throughout the match with Djokovic the first to achieve a break in the eighth game of the third set, propelling him to the brink of the title after the pair had shared tiebreaks in the first two sets.

Djokovic then capitalised on a flagging Murray, who had battled to a five-set win over Roger Federer on Friday, breaking early in the fourth set and then holding on to clinch the Norman Brookes Challenge Cup for the fourth time.

'What a joy. It's an incredible feeling to win this trophy again,' Djokovic said. 'This is definitely my favourite grand slam. I love this tournament. I love this court.

'I have to congratulate Andy and thank him.

'We have played so many great matches in the last two years. Bad luck for tonight but I wish you best of luck for the season.'

Members of Murray's family took to Twitter after the final to congratulate the winner.

Judy Murray, his mother, wrote: 'Congrats @DjokerNole. Incredible athlete. Perfect gentleman. #ausopen.'

Murray's brother Jamie Murray tweeted: 'Congrats to @DjokerNole incredible player and achievement! 3 Aussie Opens in a row. Treat yourself.'

Fellow Scots sent their commiserations to Murray, with writer Irvine Welsh tweeting: 'Hard luck Andy, did us proud again pal.'

Sir Chris Hoy tweeted: 'Hard luck Andy Murray, still 3 more attempts left this year.'

Other sportsmen to tweet their messages of support included footballer Rio Ferdinand, who wrote: 'Unlucky @andy-murray. Nole is a machine man.'

Australian cricket player Shane Warne wrote: 'Congrats to Djokovic on winning the Australian open tennis final. Wanted Andy Murray to win it."

Tom Daley wrote: 'Well played @andy-murray , great match! #teamadidas.'

Labour leader Ed Miliband congratulated both players, writing: 'Great achievement for Murray to reach the @AustralianOpen Final. Congratulations to Djokovic on his victory.'

The bruising battle, which left Murray with huge blisters that required treatment during the match, was received in his hometown of Dunblane with disappointment.

Eyes dropped to the floor as fans buried their heads in hands as the final shot was played.

Around 40 people had gathered at a bar in the Dunblane Hotel - many had been there from 8am, for what they hoped would be a historic win for the tennis ace.

Murray finally clinched his 
first grand slam title in September last year when he beat Djokovic in 
the US Open final - a month after being crowned Olympic champion.

For
Britons it meant their 76-year wait for a male tennis grand slam winner
was finally over - the last British man to achieve that feat was Fred 
Perry at the US Open in 1936.

Though her son may have lost, tennis star Andy Murray's mother has achieved her own 'love match' at the Australian Open.She has met-up with her latest crush - ex US Open champion Pat Rafter.

Last week Judy Murray said she was entering a competition to have breakfast with Rafter and had been 'pressing resend since 8am'.

Tweeting from the Australian Open, Judy finally got her wish.

'Sitting beside Pat Rafter in the player cafe. In serious need of a tranquiliser dart. Me, I mean,' she tweeted at the weekend.

It is not the first time that Judy has revealed her admiration of tennis
hunks. In 2011 she dubbed her son Andy's then opponent Feliciano Lopez 
'Deliciano' on her Twitter account.

Rafter is also known for his charity work. He donated half of the prize 
money from his 1997 and 1998 US Open wins to the Starlight Children's 
Foundation; he attempted to do so anonymously in 1997 but was 
unsuccessful. He has created his own charity organisation that raises 
funds for children's causes each year.

Since his retirement, Rafter has gone on to become an underwear model for Bonds.

Mr
Salmond said: 'In Australia the Melbourne Cup is the horse race that 
stops the nation, but Murray's bid for a title in Melbourne will be the 
match that brings Scotland to a standstill.

'After Andy's victory over Novak 
Djokovic to take the US Open title, there is no doubt this will be a 
clash of the tennis titans.

'I know I won't be the only one glued
to the television as the whole of Scotland cheers Andy on for back to 
back grand slam success.'

Murray's
mother Judy said she is expecting a 'cracking match'. She told BBC 
Radio Scotland yesterday: 'If it's anything like the US Open Final it is
going to be a great match.

'I think both Novak and Andy are in the 
form of their lives. They are very similar players, they are great 
athletes and if they both play their best it could be an absolutely 
cracking match.'
