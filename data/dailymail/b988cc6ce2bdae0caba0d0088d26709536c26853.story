Michael Salmon pictured leaving Reading Crown Court where he faces more than a dozen charges, including 11 counts of indecent assault and three counts of rape

A doctor who worked at a hospital at the centre of the Jimmy Savile scandal assaulted a young girl after offering to check her breasts for cancer, a court has heard.

Today the woman, now aged 48, told a jury at Reading Crown Court she was taken to see Michael Salmon by her boarding school matron after suffering from migraines.

However, consultant Salmon asked the matron to leave the  room and offered to check the then-15-year-old's breasts for cancer before assaulting her, the court was told.

Salmon, 79, was working as a consultant pediatrician at Buckingham Hospital, Buckinghamshire, in 1981, when teenager was taken to him for treatment.

The woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, told the jury: 'I remember being taken into the room and I remember meeting Dr Salmon.

'I think there was a nurse from the hospital. I can't remember if it was a nurse or a matron from the school. Dr Salmon said she did not need to be in there and she left.

'I remember him talking to me about migraines and then he offered to check my breasts for breast cancer.

'He asked me to take off my top and bra and he checked my breasts. I remember seeing his hands and just looking. I remember being stunned and not understanding what was going on.'

The alleged offence occurred when she was a pupil at Charmandean Boarding School in Buckinghamshire.

She added:  'I remember being completely surprised and stunned. I didn't say anything.'

Prosecuting at Reading Crown Court, Miranda Moore QC read a letter written to the woman's mother from Salmon, in which he described her as her 'charming daughter.'

Cross-examining, Sarah Jones quizzed the woman on whether she remembered seeing Salmon for a second appointment and if she felt nervous.

She replied: 'I do not recall. I imagine so but I do not know.'

When questioned about whether she wanted the nurse to leave because she felt shy about removing her clothes, the witness replied: 'I was not expecting to remove my clothes, I want to be really clear about that.'

She told the jury of five women and seven men: 'I am speaking here today because I did not speak when I was 15. I know what happened.'

Smartly-dressed Salmon, wearing a blue and white checked shirt and suit, listened to proceedings using a hearing loop. 

The 79-year-old is on trial at Reading Crown Court where a judge previously heard how he abused his position as consultant paediatrician at Stoke Mandeville Hospital in Buckinghamshire – where disgraced DJ Savile is said to have abused scores of patients while carrying out charity work.

Jurors were told that although Salmon did not abuse victims ‘in concert’ with Savile, the sex attacks between 1973 and 1988 occurred at the same time as other offences.

The court heard that the woman went to the police in December 2013 after her mother read about Salmon in the newspapers and asked her which doctor she had seen as a child.

In a telephone call to her mother, she said: Don't talk to me about him because he is a perv.'

The court heard she had undergone counselling since the alleged assault. Miss Jones said: 'If you knew it was wrong from as far ago as then, would it not have cropped up in at least one of your counselling sessions?'

The witness said: 'No, there was other stuff to deal with.'

When quizzed on why she did not object to the assault, the victim replied: 'It all happened so quickly. He was a doctor so I thought it must be okay. My mind was just going mad. I did not know if it was right or wrong but my head was just screaming. He was a doctor and I was a child.'

The court heard that Salmon - while working as a consultant pediatrician at Buckingham Hospital (pictured) in 1981 - asked the girl to undress so he could give her a 'breast cancer check'

Salmon is also facing charges for alleged offending at Stoke Mandeville Hospital, where serial paedophile Jimmy Savile (pictured left and right) is said to have preyed on children

Miss Jones said: 'I would suggest that all Mr Salmon ever did to you was examine you appropriately at the start of your dealings with him and that was it.'

She replied: 'That is not correct.'

The witness' mother told the jury she was 'absolutely appalled' when her daughter told her what had happened. She said: 'It is an abuse of a position of trust. I said to her: "it is up to you, but you could report it".'

Salmon, of Salisbury, Wiltshire, denies 11 counts of indecent assault, three counts of rape and two counts of procuring an instrument for abortion, which relate to eight victims aged between 11 and 18 years. The offences were alleged to have taken place between 1973 and 1988.

The trial continues.
