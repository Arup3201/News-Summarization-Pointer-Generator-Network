A mother claims the man who fatally shot her son left her voicemails saying he deserved to die.  

Curtis Shaver, 51, was killed when he was shot by Richard Kropp, his friend of 30 years, in Kansas City, Kansas.

Kropp, 56, claims he fired in self-defense on his front yard after Shaver came at him with a walking stick during an alleged 4am argument on July 23, according to Fox 4.

Carole Thrasher claims she has been called by Richard Kropp, who shot dead her son Curtis Shaver, telling her he deserved to die

Shaver's mother Carole Thrasher said she received three voicemails in the middle of the night on July 28 from Kropp.

Mrs Thrasher, 73, told Fox 4: 'I knew who it was and it also showed on my caller ID. He said Curtis deserved what he got.

'I’m sorry you’re trying to sell that to the wrong person. I’m Curtis’ mother and he did not deserve to die.'

Shaver's family claim he had been threatened in recent weeks by his old friend.

Mrs
Thrasher told the news channel: 'It does seem to me that he should be 
charged with murder.

'I don’t know how you threaten to shoot someone, 
then do it and then you’re allowed to say well I did it in 
self-defense.'

In a separate incident, Kropp has been charged with two drugs offences after marijuana was found growing in his home.

Kropp claims Shaver had stolen $100,000 from his house, along with some gold and 300 lighters.

But Mrs Shaver said she does not believe the story.

She added that her son struggled to walk because of a previous gun-shot wound and therefore could not have posed a serious threat.

Mrs Shaver contacted Kansas City police over the three phone calls and was given a temporary restraining order.

She is also due in court to try to get a full order of protection.

Investigators are waiting for toxicology results before a decision is made on whether to charge Kropp with murder, Fox 4 reported.
