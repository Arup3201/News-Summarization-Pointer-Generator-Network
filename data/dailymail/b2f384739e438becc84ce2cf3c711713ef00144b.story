An aspiring Florida model returning from a trip to Jamaica has been arrested for allegedly hiding a stash of cocaine in her vagina.

KathyAnn Ferguson, 26, from Hollywood, was taken into custody Sunday at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport and charged with cocaine trafficking.

The traveler flew in aboard JetBlue Flight 2316 from Montego Bay, Jamaica, at around 4.15pm, according to her arrest affidavit.

The 5-foot-7, 175-pound woman was subjected to a security search, during which she admitted to a US Customs and Border Protection officer that she had a 'package' crammed inside her privates.

After being taken into custody, Ms Ferguson removed the container from her body herself; the powdery substance inside tested positive for cocaine.

According to the affidavit obtained by Sun-Sentinel, Ferguson was transporting 172 grams of the drug, or about 6 ounces.

Ferguson was then taken to an area hospital to receive medical attention before she was booked into the Broward County Main Jail. She has since been released on $15,000 bond.

A year later, she landed in jail once again on charges of aggravated battery with a weapon and misdemeanor simple battery.
