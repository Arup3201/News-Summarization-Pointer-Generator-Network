An airline which was named America’s most hated is offering 8,000 free air miles to passengers – who moan about it on social media.

Ultra-low budget US carrier Spirit Airlines has launched a campaign called Hate Miles, where it rewards travellers who have had a bad experience on board one of its flights – or its competitors’.

Whether it’s frustrations about carry-on luggage charges, expensive food costs or pre-assigned seating, Spirit is urging customers to vent their anger in 140 characters on Twitter.

New campaign: Spirit's new website encourages passengers to moan about the airline online

In return, they’ll be handed 8,000 
free air miles – almost enough for a one-way trip with the airline, 
which has received more complaints than any other domestic carrier for 
five years in a row.

As 
ever, there’s a catch – with passengers needing 10,000 total miles to 
secure a free flight, or flyers can sign up for the airline’s credit 
card to be able to book 2,500-mile one-way fares.

To
 launch the campaign, Spirit, which has long come under fire from 
disgruntled passengers over extra charges, has set up a website called 
www.hatethousandmiles.com, which includes a humorous video about the 
initiative.

The site says: ‘Airlines mess up – but at least Spirit Airlines is willing to admit it.

‘We haven’t been great about telling you how we fly. We want to be better. 

‘First, let’s clear the air. Hate on us – or any airline of your choosing – and we’ll send you 8,000 FREE SPIRIT miles.

‘You’ll be well on your way to earning an award flight with us.

High complaints: Spirit topped the chart for grievances over the past five years

We
 think that once you understand how we fly - how our total price is, on 
average, 40%* lower than other airlines - you just might learn to love 
us.’

In April, MailOnline 
Travel reported every year from 2009-2013, passengers were three times 
as likely to have an issue with Spirit than they were the second-place 
airline.

The figures were calculated based on complaints - from flights and fares, to baggage and refunds – per 100,000 passengers.

Chart-topper: More complaints have been made about Spirit Airlines than any other carrier in the US

In
 fact, Spirit received so many complaints, according to the the U.S. 
Public Interest Research Group Education Fund report, it had to be 
excluded from deeper analysis of on-time performance, baggage 
mishandling, and other issues.

The airline also has its own ‘boycott Spirit’ Facebook page, and a Twitter handle called @hatespiritair.

The
 report, which analysed consumer complaints filed with the Department of
 Transportation, said of Spirit: 'Two checked bags, basic meals and 
snacks, carry-ons, and, often, in-flight entertainment were formerly 
included in the price of your ticket, but now add-on fees for each of 
these newly a la carte items can easily add $100 or more to the cost of a
 one-way ticket.’ .
