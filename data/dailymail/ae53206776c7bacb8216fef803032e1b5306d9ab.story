One hour after the early morning shooting up of a house in which a  man sleeping in the front bedroom was seriously wounded, a man returned to the house to do a re-enactment for his mate.

Caught on CCTV footage, the man and his mate are seen to pull up in the driveway of the house on Cruickshank Street, Blakeview, in the far northern suburbs of  Adelaide.

The driver of the dark blue VS Series 2 Holden Calais sedan leaps from the car and runs towards the dwelling.

Clearly excited, the man, who is wearing a red t-shirt and shorts, fires with his finger at the house, aping the gun's recoil. His mate stands next to the car watching the enthusiastic recreation, which includes wild arm movements, staggering and the finger gun action.

At 6.45am on February 26 this year, a 26-year-old man in the front bedroom of a house in Blakeview, in Adelaide's far northern suburbs, was shot three times in the back and suffered a collapsed lung. Detectives released CCTV of a man (circled in red) 'in an excited state' who appears to recreate the shooting with hand gestures, and who they believe is the shooter recreating the crime for a mate, and have asked the public to help identify him  

It's 7.56am on Sunday, February 23 - barely an hour since a man inside the Adelaide house outside which the silver and white cars (pictured) are parked and the man in the red t-shirt has pulled up in the dark blue VS Series 2 Holden Calais sedan which he parks temporarily in the driveway as he heads onto the property

Second later, and from what appears to be a different camera angle, the man heads past a red car in the front yard of the house on Cruickshank Street, Blakeview in Adelaide's far northern suburbs where just an hour and a few minutes earlier a 23-year-old m,an has been shot three times in the back with a .22 calibre hand gun

The shaven headed man in the red t-shirt and shorts, who police say looked to be in an excited state, heads past the car. He is about to swap places with his mate and begin his recreation of the shooting

It is the morning of February 23 this year, and a 26-year-old has just been taken to hospital with a collapsed lung and three wounds in his upper back fired from a .22 calibre hand gun into his bedroom at around 6.45am.

Still clearly excited about the incident, for which Adelaide detectives believe he is either the shooter or a witness, red t-shirt spends about a minute and a half showing off to his friend, before they get back in the car, reverse out and drive off.

Police from the Crime Gangs Task Force released the CCTV footage on Wednesday to ask for help from the public in identifying the man, or anyone in connection with the shooting.

Gotcha: South Australian detectives released CCTV footage today of a man apparently recreating a shooting an hour after it happened on a suburban street in the northern Adelaide suburb of Blakeview. They have appealed to the public to help identify the men in the security footage

The man in the red t-shirt gets ready to show his mate just what occurred an hour earlier at this address in Blakeview, in the far northern suburbs of Adelaide, when a 26-year-old was shot three times in the back and taken to hospital with a collapsed lung

A fraction of a second later and red t-shirt raises his arms, checks his mate is watching and and prepares to make a firing motion on the house

Total recoil: The suspect bends his body as if in recoil from firing the weapon, whih police have identified as a .22 calibre handgun which fired three rounds into the victim, who now faces continuing health problems following the collapse of one of his lungs

Task Force Detective Chief Inspector Kim Hand said a protracted investigation following the shooting had led to the seizure of the CCTV footage from an address in Elizabeth, in Adelaide's north about 6km from the site of the incident.

'We believe this shows a man who, in quite an excited state, is seen to re-enact what police believe occurred at the Blakeview property just an hour earlier,' Inspector Hand said.

We know the man in this footage went to the address in a dark blue VS Series 2 Holden Calais sedan, which is now in the possession of police.

More action: the man appears to flail around as if acting the possible response from the victim of the shooting

Bang bang: more gesticulations from the man to show what had occurred  at the suburban Adelaide house where just over an hour earlier a man sleeping in a front bedroom was shot in the back three times with a hand gun

And then I did this: the as yet unidentified man in the red shirt puts the finishing touches on his recreation for his mate of what had occurred earlier that morning in the shoot-up on a suburban Adelaide street

Show's over: Time to go as the man finishes his 80 second mime of the suburban house shooting for his mate and the pair climb back into the Holden Calais and take off. Police say soon after this a woman and a man were observed burning clothing on the side of the road just 6km south of this house in Blakeview, Adelaide

'Police believe that while the incident was not random, the victim in this case was not the intended target of the shooting.'Investigators are also keen to identify the second man in the footage and believe he can help with the inquiry.

The Task Force is also seeking the public's help to identify a man and a woman seen burning clothing on a road on the same morning at Kudla, just 6kms further north of the shooting site.

The pair were spotted standing in front of a dark-coloured 4WD at around 8.30am, appearing to set fire to something on the left verge of Dalkeith road, near Coventry Road, Kudla.

A small fire was located at teh side of the road, and burnt clothing was recovered which police believe may be related to the shooting.

Police say the injured man may suffer long-term health consequences as a result of the wound which caused his lung to collapse.

Anyone with information about either of these incidents, or who recognises the man in the CCTV footage, is urged to call Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000 or report online at https://sa.crimestoppers.com.au/
