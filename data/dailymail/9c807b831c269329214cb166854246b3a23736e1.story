Hugo Lloris should be clear to play against Manchester United on Sunday, despite being left bleeding from the mouth after what looked like another worrying challenge on the Spurs goalkeeper.

Lloris was flattened when Jamie Vardy ran into him with a late attempt to win the ball in the 89th minute at the King Power Stadium but Mauricio Pochettino claimed his No 1 will still feature against United.

The Frenchman was treated by medics on the pitch and there were concerning echoes of last season when the Frenchman was knocked unconscious after a collision with Everton’s Romelu Lukaku.

‘Hugo took a knock on his face but he is OK,’ said Pochettino, ‘He just has a cut inside his mouth but there will be no problem for Manchester United.

He has no fear in those situations. We know he is one of the best keepers in the world.’

Lloris made two vital saves, notably from an excellent Riyad Mahrez effort in the course of Friday’s victory.

Nigel Pearson had little sympathy for him, claiming Vardy’s challenge was fair.

‘Bless him, they have it hard those keepers,’ scoffed Leicester’s boss, ‘I don’t think Jamie was in the wrong. He was booked simply for being committed in his challenge.’
