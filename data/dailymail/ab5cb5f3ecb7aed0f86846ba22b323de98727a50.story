A 'gentle giant' father-of-six lost his battle with lung cancer - just hours before his wedding.

Steven Logan, of Baildon, West Yorkshire, was diagnosed with the disease in July and he and his partner of 15-years Kate Rodgers, had planned to marry in the coming spring. 

After initially showing early signs of recovery - thanks to intensive chemotherapy - the 47-year-old's health began to decline in November after the disease spread to his liver.

As his health deteriorated, his distraught partner, 32, tried to bring forward their wedding so they could be married at their home.

But tragically, he died just hours before a registrar was due to arrive. 

Ms Rodgers, who described her 20-stone bricklayer fiance as a 'gentle giant', said: 'I'd sorted it with the registrar who was happy to come out and marry us the next day.

'I had to go and pick up the licences in the morning, but Steven was so ill, struggling with his breath, that I couldn't leave him and he died at lunchtime.

'He had always managed to get himself up and into a chair, but that morning we were just together in bed and he faded away.

'Typically his last words to me were making sure our children got their Christmas presents okay.

'We told them what was wrong, but that daddy was always going to get better - and he really believed that too.

'Now they know he's in heaven - the brightest star in the sky is what we call him. And they even have a telescope to look for that brightest star.'

The couple have two sons Billy, aged nine, Jack, six, and daughter Macey-Jayne, four, while Mr Logan also had three grown-up children from a previous marriage and four grandchildren.

Now the youngsters write short letters to their father which are then set alight.

Ms Rodgers explained: 'The smoke goes up, so they know he can read them in heaven.

'Steven wasn't the kind to admit being poorly, but when he did go to the doctors they gave huge doses of chemotherapy at Bradford Royal Infirmary.

But they could not stop the cancer spreading to his liver.

'Steven was a strong, fit man who worked hard and loved country walking, but he was also a smoker and it does get you.'

When news of his illness broke, friends and family rallied round to organise fundraising events to pay for the couple's planned spring wedding.

Mr Logan's friend, Maria Crump, said: 'We organised a couple of nights out to raise money and also people had promised to donate a wedding cake, hire cars and even a double decker bus for the big day.

'But sadly now any money raised will be going to pay for Steven's funeral on January 9 at Nab Wood Cemetery.'

Ms Rodgers added: 'Steven was a great big man, but so kind and gentle - any more laid back and he'd have been asleep.

'He would do anything for people, but the main thing in his life was being a family man who loved nothing more than spending time with his kids and grandchildren.

'In the last few month he had reunions with family members he'd not seen for ages and that was so important to him.

'Now I've got to keep going strong for our children.

'We'd meant to get married many times over the years. We never got round to it and now it's too late.

'One more day and we'd have made it, but now I'm planning Steven's funeral.

'But I will still take his name and I will have his ashes made into a wedding ring I'll wear forever.'
