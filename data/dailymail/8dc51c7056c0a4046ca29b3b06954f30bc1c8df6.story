Hundreds of thousands of pensioners will dip into their savings next year

More than 200,000 pensioners are likely cash in their entire retirement savings next year when new pension reforms are introduced, pollsters revealed last night.

Research by Ipsos Mori for The Times has found that one in five OAPs will use part of the windfall to pay for a holiday.

The study is the first detailed examination of Chancellor George Osborne’s reforms, in which those aged over 55 can dip into their retirement savings for the first time without having to pay punitive tax rates.

Mr Osborne announced he was scrapping the current rules next April.

When the measures were first announced in March, the Treasury did not give estimates as to how many would take advantage of the reforms or how their money would be spent.

The 200,000 figure is calculated from the latest research, which suggests 12 per cent are planning to cash in their entire pension pot.

And when pensioners spend their cash, it could mean a windfall of up to £1.6billion in tax for the Treasury, according to financial company Hargreaves Lansdown.

Tom McPhail, head of pensions research at the broker, said this revealed many were significantly underestimating the amount of tax they would pay despite the reforms.

A quarter of each lump sum taken out will be tax-free – with the remaining amount taxed at the marginal rate.

The poll found the most popular choice (23 per cent) would be to save the money. But 21 per cent would choose to put it towards a holiday, 8 per cent said they would spend the cash on cars, and 12 per cent said some would go towards DIY.

Liberal Democrat pensions minister Steve Webb has previously shot down the idea pensioners would blow their savings.

When Mr Osborne’s announcement was made, he said: ‘If people do get a Lamborghini and end up on the state pension, the state is much less concerned about that and that is their choice.’

Other popular choices were spending pension money on the family (14 per cent) and paying off debts (13 per cent).

Meanwhile 16 per cent said they would reinvest in property – fuelling fears of another buy-to-let boom.

Mr Osborne confirmed earlier this month that the changes would mean people could withdraw as little or as much as they wanted.

He said: ‘People who have worked hard and saved all their lives should be free to choose what they do with their money, and that freedom is central to our long-term economic plan.’

Mr McPhail said: ‘Whilst we support the basic principles behind the Government’s reforms, the speed and complexity of these changes mean a lot of investors are going to be paying unnecessarily large amounts of tax.

'The Chancellor has effectively engineered a tax windfall from unsuspecting pension investors.’

Some economists have warned allowing folk to withdraw cash from their pension pots rather than buying an annuity, providing an income for life, was risky.

They argue that most people aged 60 or 65 underestimate their life expectancy and could overspend early in retirement.

But Mr Osborne insists 13million savers in defined contribution pension schemes are ‘responsible people’ who had saved throughout their lives and quite capable of making decisions for themselves.
