Christopher Tappin, 65, always maintained his innocence, saying he was a victim of an FBI sting. He has since pleaded guilty

A retired British businessman who was extradited to the U.S. earlier this year has pleaded guilty at a court hearing to selling surface-to-air missile parts to Iran.

Christopher Tappin, 65, had pleaded not guilty but changed his plea at a hearing in El Paso, Texas, this afternoon in an agreement with US prosecutors.

His guilty plea, to one count of the indictment, calls for a 33-month sentence which prosecutors have said they will not oppose him serving back in the UK.

U.S. District Judge David Briones will sentence Tappin, of Orpington, Kent, on January 9. Tappin is on bail after being extradited to the US in February.

The former president of the Kent Golf Union has previously denied attempting to sell batteries for surface-to-air missiles which were to be shipped from the US to Tehran via the Netherlands, saying he was the victim of an FBI sting.

His wife Elaine, 62, said ahead of today's hearing that 'however upsetting' a plea deal was, it marked the beginning of his 'swift and safe return' to the UK.

Tappin's lawyer, Dan Cogdell, said he expected him to serve several months in a US prison while authorities in Washington and the UK decide whether to extradite him.

He was originally thought to have faced up to 35 years in jail if found guilty.

The case followed an investigation which started in 2005 when US agents asked technology providers about buyers who might have raised red flags.

Those customers were then approached by undercover companies set up by government agencies.Two other men have already been sentenced.

Briton Robert Gibson, an associate of Tappin who agreed to co-operate, was jailed for 24 months after pleading guilty to conspiracy to export defence articles.

Gibson provided customs agents with 
about 16,000 computer files and emails indicating that he and Tappin had
long-standing commercial ties with Iranian customers.

American Robert Caldwell was also 
found guilty of aiding and abetting the illegal transport of defence 
articles and served 20 months in prison.

Plea bargaining is common in the US, 
with defendants often able to secure a more lenient sentence if they 
admit an offence and co-operate with prosecutors, rather than contest 
the charges in a trial.

Tappin's UK lawyer, Karen Todner, who
also represented computer hacker Gary McKinnon in his successful 
10-year fight against extradition, said 98 per cent of people who enter the US 
justice system agree a plea deal.
