When CIA official and mother-of-three Jennifer Matthews was killed by a suicide bomber at her Afghan base, fingers were pointed in her direction.

A report into the attack claimed that as the chief of the Khost unit, she had failed to properly vet an informant who had come to speak with officials.

The informant slayed the al-Qaeda specialist and six other CIA operatives by detonating a vest of explosives, the Washington Post reported.

Killed: CIA official Jennifer Matthews was killed by an Afghan suicide bomber in 2009. A report suggested she was to blame for not preventing the attack

Now, for the first time since the December 2009 attack, Matthews's husband has spoken out against the treatment of the mother of his children, who had volunteered for the mission in a bid to beat al-Qaeda.

Speaking to the Post, Gary Anderson expressed his anger at the CIA for blaming his wife, claiming it should have trained her better.

'Why wasn't [the suicide bomber] checked in transit to the base?' Anderson asked, criticising the CIA for being seduced by the jihadist killer.

He said one of the CIA operatives killed in the attack had expressed concern over the bomber's trustworthiness - yet nothing had been done.

'This stuff should have gone back to headquarters, and someone should have made a call,' Anderson said.

While commentators did not mention Matthews by name initially, they pointed fingers at a 'mother of three' at the base.

They said she had gone against 
trade-craft rules by congregating staff around the 
building's entrance for the welcome of Humam Khalil al-Balawi, a Jordanian 
doctor believed to have infiltrated al-Qaeda's top ranks.

Detonating his life vest seconds 
after climbing out of the car, he was able to bring down seven American 
officials in one easy swoop.

Matthews, hit in the neck and with her leg burned to the bone, died in a helicopter on the way to hospital.

It was not the first time the CIA agent had been blamed for an attack.

A few years after the 9/11 attacks in
 New York City, the CIA released a report recommending disciplinary 
action against Matthews and others.

It suggested the agency managers had not warned the FBI about two al-Qaeda members in the country since 2000. The CIA director declined to take any disciplinary action.

In 2005, she moved to London to serve as chief counter terrorism liaison to the British intelligence services - a comparatively comfortable role that she filled for four years.

She was joined by Anderson and her children at a central-London home, where a nanny cooked and they would enjoy British TV shows on a Saturday night, the Post reported.

But the easy life was not one for Matthews, who was desperate to tackle al-Qaeda.

When the job in Khost came up, Matthews snapped up the opportunity, former CIA 
assistant director Charles E. Allen said.

She was 'haunted' by the blame she 
had received for 9/11, and hoped the tough work 
would rid her record of the blemish.

Anderson told the Post he is incensed by
 how his wife was treated after her death, referencing an article by 
former CIA operative Robert Baer.

The GQ piece claimed the CIA chief, whom he named 'Kathy', was 'set up to fail' and 'in over her head', the Post reported.

'It was just mean,' Anderson, a chemist 
living in Fredericksburg, Pennsylvania, said. 'It was like, "Girls can't
 do this stuff".'

While Anderson vehemently supports his wife, Matthews, who began focusing on al-Qaeda in the 1990s, has come under fire from her own relatives.

Her uncle Dave Matthews, a former CIA official, told the Post: 'If Jenny followed trade-craft rules, this wouldn't have happened ... She wasn't trained.'

agency could protect its operatives

Anderson remembered: 'About a week before the funeral, Dave said she didn't know what she was doing. And this was her fault. I was like, "Okay, we're done".'

He told the Post he is working hard to be a good single parent to his bereaved children.

He recounted the moment he told his daughter, now 14, and two sons, 11 and nine, about their mother's death.

'I just said to them, "Your mom has died". The two oldest fell apart. They started crying,' he said. 'One of them asked, "Is this really true?" I just kind of hugged them.'

He added: 'They just miss their mom.'
