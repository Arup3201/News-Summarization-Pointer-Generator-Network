No help: Meenakshi Minnis, 31, who is expecting her second child, says she had asked Metrolink staff to find her a seat but they failed to help her

A mother-to-be was stunned when 'barbaric' passengers on a packed tram refused to give up their tram seat - even though she is eight months' pregnant and needs crutches to walk.

Meenakshi Minnis, 31, found all the seats were taken when she boarded the service at Deansgate-Castlefield on her way home to Timperley. Mrs Minnis asked passengers on the tram if they would give up their seat - but no-one moved.

Shockingly, even when a Metrolink member of staff asked if anyone would stand for her, nobody would oblige.

She had to stand until the tram had travelled four stops to Stretford before a seat became available. Mrs Minnis, who is expecting her second child, says she had asked Metrolink staff to find her a seat but they failed to help her.

Mrs Minnis said: 'I am a regular customer with Metrolink and I need a seat because the movement of the tram causes problems with my balance. It was very busy and I let one tram go by because it was packed.

'There were about 10 staff on the platform and when the second tram arrived it was also busy, so I asked a member of staff if she would help me find a seat. She looked at me as if I was being unreasonable.'

Mrs Minnis, who needs crutches to help her walk because of a pelvic condition linked to her pregnancy, complained to tram bosses after the journey on November 11. She says she has not had an official response. Mrs Minnis, who lives with husband David and their three-year-old son Dilan said: 'I think it is important to make sure this doesn't happen to anyone else. This needs to be addressed.

'I ended up standing and nearly most my balance - if I had fallen it could have been really serious.'

Mike Mabey, head of passenger services at Metrolink, said officials had reviewed CCTV and found a member of staff did ask passengers to give up their seats, but no one was willing to do so.

He said: 'We were extremely saddened 
to hear of Mrs Minnis' tram experience.Unfortunately, staff can only 
request that a passenger give up their seat. We are not able to force 
them should they choose not to.'

The behaviour by commuters on the 
packed tram has been described as 'barbaric'
by leading etiquette expert William Hanson who travels the world 
teaching British etiquette for consultancy firm The English Manner.

He said: 'This behaviour is appalling and there is no excuse whatsoever to not stand up and offer a seat. It's selfish and these passengers should be ashamed of themselves.

'Mrs Minnis should not have had to ask for a seat in the first place - but the fact she did and still no-one got up is frankly barbaric.

'There may be set conventions about standing up for the elderly or pregnant which were common 30 years ago, but people are selfish and glued to their mobile phones now.

'People around the world still see Britain as the home of etiquette but stories like these make you wonder if we have lost that now.'

Dr Lisa Oakley, a lecturer in psychology at Manchester Metropolitan University, has called for Metrolink staff to take the lead in improving their passengers' manners.

She said: 'This is a case of bystander apathy - where everyone thinks it's someone else's responsibility to do something.

'We are getting to the season of goodwill for Christmas so it would be nice if Metrolink could try and change things. I think it would help if the driver made an announcement telling passengers they should give up seats if needed at busy times.

'It's about changing the culture of people sitting in their own worlds.'

A Metrolink spokesman said staff members had asked passengers to give up their seats - but everyone had refused and they were unable to force them.
