Visitors to France will face travel chaos next week as air traffic controllers join rail workers in a nationwide strike.

SNCTA and Unsa-ICNA, the two biggest air traffic control unions, will start the six-day strike next Tuesday – and the industrial action will last until Sunday June 29.

Thousands of flights are set to be cancelled just as the summer holiday season gets into full swing.

Chaos: Flights out of French airports, including Charles de Gaulle airport, will be affected by the walk-out next week, cancelling hundreds of flights

Union representatives warned of ‘heavy disruption to all flights’, and tourists hoping to take alternative rail routes will face further delays thanks to a ten-day rail protest. French retail workers are also set to strike in protest at the government’s decision to introduce Sunday opening hours to boost tourism.

This will mean that famous Paris department stores including Galeries Lafayette and Printemps will be closed for those who do make it across the Channel.

More than 60 per cent of France’s 4,000 air traffic controllers have voted in favour of the protest against aviation cuts.

Unavoidable: The strikes are a response to President Hollande's austerity measures, which he insists are necessary

They said that the controversial measures, which will come into force between 2015 and 2019, will lead to a cheaper, less efficient system and will end up threatening ‘modernisation’.

But Francois Hollande’s Socialist government insists that the cuts are necessary to comply with European Commission plans to reduce air navigation costs.

The number of expected cancellations next week could be as high as 50 per cent, although there are fears that even this is a conservative estimate. Tourists have been told to expect long delays at every French airport, as the entire air system will be affected by the walk-outs.

More than 17million British people travel to France each year, and huge numbers from the UK will be caught up in the chaos.

EasyJet and Ryanair are preparing contingency plans ahead of the strikes, which they will announce when the scale of the disruption becomes clear.

EasyJet, which operates flights to 13 airports in France, said it was ‘disappointed’ at the ‘unnecessary strike action’, adding: ‘This has the potential to cause considerable disruption and cancellations.’

The strike was announced as France unveiled a new plan to boost tourism from 82million to 100million visitors a year – by urging the French to be nicer to foreigners.
