Swedish club Halmstad have raised some eyebrows after releasing their new away kit. 

The shirt, which is made by Puma, features a garish blend of green and yellow across a diamond pattern. 

Halmstad defender and captain Jesper Westerberg revealed the kit on his official Twitter account on Saturday, which has so far proved unpopular with fans.
