An attractive widow was flooded with messages on a dating website after posting flesh-baring shots of herself wearing a scarlet swimsuit.

For two years 57-year-old Louise Leech had been signed up to three lonely hearts sites but her profile - which featured an image of her fully dressed - failed to attract many hits.

So in a final bid to find love a second time round, she purchased a £35 red Lycra swimsuit - 
a similar shade to the one famously worn by Helen Mirren aged 63 - and uploaded a photograph of herself wearing it on her profile.

Eye-catching: Louise posing in the £35 red Lycra swimsuit which helped attract 900 admirers

She was surprised to discover that within two days she had received over 900 responses from would-be suitors.

The romantic fiction writer, of Dennistoun, Glasgow, is now sifting through the messages hopeful that she will score an eligible bachelor.

She said: 'It’s overwhelming, I couldn’t believe it.

'I am a respectable woman but that picture has made men go wild. I have received all sorts of messages. It’s wonderful.'

Ms Leech’s life was shattered when Gerry, her husband of 30 years, died suddenly three years ago aged just 63.

After over a year of grieving, she finally plucked up the courage to start dating again.

Change of tactic: The picture that Louise posted on the website

Louise posted a picture of herself on her profile on the senior dating website www.seniorfishdating.co.uk

Over the next two years she joined three different lonely heart websites but had very limited success.

So she decided to take a different approach and bought the Marks
& Spencer shapewear swim suit, usually modelled by Lisa Snowdon, 
posting a picture of herself on the senior dating website 
www.seniorfishdating.co.uk.

And when she checked back online 48 hours later her inbox was full with emails from new admirers.

She
said: 'When the person you have been married to for 30 years suddenly 
isn’t there any more, getting the courage to get back out there is hard.

'I
know so many widows out there who are at a loss. It’s really difficult.
So I want to spread the message that it is simply not true.'

Ms Leech, who has written two romantic novels, said she completely lost her confidence following the death of her husband, but internet dating has given her a boost.

She added: 'After the grieving process I tried 
internet dating but I quickly retreated back into myself.

'The 
response I have had now has really given me confidence. The difference 
between before the photo and after is like night and day.'

Inspired by actress Helen Mirren, who attracted attention after wearing a red bikini at the age of 63, Louise went to her local Mark & Spencer and purchased a scarlet swimsuit
