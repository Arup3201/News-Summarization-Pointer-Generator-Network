'Just lost it': Former RAF sergeant Frederick Gilliard, 76, killed his wife with a garden gnome

An elderly ex-RAF sergeant who beat his wife to death with a garden gnome before stabbing her ten times was today jailed for four years.

Frederick Gilliard, 76, said he 'just lost it' after a row with his wife Josephine, 74, to whom he had been married for 54 years.

Mr Gillard, who called police to the couple's Blackpool home, told officers 'this is going to kill my kids, I loved that woman,' Preston Crown Court heard.

The couple were described as a 'decent, hardworking couple' who raised four children and had three grandchildren.

Members of his family wept in the public gallery as he was jailed.

Mr Gilliard had also served in the RAF for 27 years including seeing active service during the conflict in Aden, and had previously suffered from depression.

It was during a 'depressive episode' on February 5th last year, that Mr Gillard used a garden ornament shaped like an Easter Island statue, and an eight inch carving knife, to kill his wife, the court heard.

Mrs Gilliard, 74, who was attacked in their bedroom, suffered ‘catastrophic’ head injuries and ten stab wounds of ‘considerable force’ to her neck, chest and stomach.

He then dialled 999 telling the operator ‘I just lost it’ summoning police to the family home in Blackpool, Lancashire where his wife lay dead.

When officers arrived he said: ‘I can’t believe it. This is going to kill my kids. We have been married 54 years. I loved that woman.’

Gilliard was originally charged with murder but at an earlier hearing pleaded guilty to manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility due to his depression.

Passing sentence Judge Anthony Russell QC, Recorder of Preston, told the defendant: ‘This is a terrible tragedy which has affected all of your family and you, and must have inflicted considerable emotional damage which can never be repaired.’

Frail Gilliard, who walks with a stoop and wears glasses and hearing aids in both ears, could not hear proceedings and looked over to his family in the public gallery who held up four fingers to indicate the sentence.
