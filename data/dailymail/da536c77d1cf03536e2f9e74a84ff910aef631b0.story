Mugshots don't often appear to bring out your best side, and unless you're blessed with model-like looks, odds are your picture will be an ugly one.

Alan Dale Lee, 45, first came to the 
attention of officers in Florida when he was arrested for alleged 
aggravated battery and selling of marijuana in August 2009.

Nicknamed by police ‘Dracula’ for his unsightly buck teeth, these series of mug shots have drawn horror from the public because of his strange and crooked teeth.

Crooked crook: Alan Lee Dale was arrested in 2009 for alleged aggravated battery and sale of marijuana

His face shows the damage caused by using methamphetamine over the years.

The gap-toothed 45-year-old came under 
the gaze of the law again just over a year later, in October 2010, when 
he was arrested for alleged sale and possession of marijuana.

His face may be older but his distinctly crooked teeth remain the same.

Undeterred by his embarrassing mugshots, Lee was back in the spotlight again in 2012 on another drugs charge.

He was most recently arrested by Florida’s Dade City Police Department for alleged possession of methamphetamine.

Lee's startling image is not the first police mugshot to provoke jokes and titters from the general public.

Other alleged criminals have been mocked for their odd expressions, bad skin, bizarre tattoos and bedraggled appearances.

From a man caught wearing a woman's wig to a man with a chin so large he was unable to escape police.

Some of the characters look as though they're from a horror movie - which might make some sense when you consider many of them were photographed on Halloween!

He has a radio station tatoo on his forehead

In recent days, Facebook users appear to be enamored with Jeremy Meeks, the man in a mugshot posted by police in Stockton, California  page.

The ice blue-eyed, strong-jawed likeness of Jeremy Meeks was quickly plastered across Twitter as thousands of social media users have themselves been arrested...by the 30-year-old's undeniable good looks.

Meeks, already a convicted felon, was hauled in as part of a gang police sweep, but he's the one sweeping internet denizens off their feet.

Stealing hearts: Jeremy Meeks, 30, was arrested in a gang raid by Stockton, California police on Wednesday. His arresting mugshot was subsequently posted to the police department's Facebook page and in fewer than 24 hours gained over 20,000 likes and received nearly six thousand comments and counting

The police puns continue on the Stockton Police Facebook page, where the photo had an unbelievable 5,800 comments by Thursday evening.

Most comments stuck to the obvious jokes:' What is he guilty of?! First Degree Sexiness?!' wrote Ashley Pruitt Carden.

Others, like Rhonda Cee, saw a moneymaking opportunity. 'He'll probably be on next years prison calendar...Mr....EVERY MONTH!' she wrote.

By far, one of the most thing to post was a comment about Meeks having missed his calling as a model.

'He needs to be a model,' wrote Bettina Jones. 'I would buy whatever he's selling!'

Meeks was charged with illegally possessing firearms and ammo, carrying a loaded firearm in public and criminal street gang activity, reports TMZ.

The repeat offender is being held on $900,000 bail, but perhaps not for long. There's talk amongst the commenters of raising the funds to set him free.

'He didn't know any different. I could turn him into a "model" citizen. Where can I pay his bail?' wrote Deborah Ann Mitchell.
