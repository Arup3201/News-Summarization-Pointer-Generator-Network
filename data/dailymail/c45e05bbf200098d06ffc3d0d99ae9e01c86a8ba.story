The gunman who killed PC Fiona Bone and PC Nicola Hughes may have carried out the shootings because he wanted to become notorious, detectives believe.

The policewomen died in a hail of bullets as they investigated a suspected burglary in Hattersley, Greater Manchester, on Tuesday. A grenade was also used in the attack.

Police are understood to be investigating the possibility that the person responsible was seeking to become infamous as a police killer.

Theory: Police are investigating whether the killer of PC Fiona Bone (left) and PC Nicola Hughes (right) carried out the attack because he wanted to become infamous

Another suggestion is that the gunman may have planned the attack because he believed he may soon be arrested for other offences.

'One line of inquiry is that the officers were shot dead because the killer wanted to make a big name for himself,' a source told the Sun.

'If he ends up in prison, he'll be one of the top dogs.'

It emerged yesterday that one of the Greater Manchester Police officers may have tried to fire a Taser at their killer moments before they were gunned down.

A 50,000-volt stun gun was found on the ground at the scene and detectives are trying to establish if one of the officers had attempted to discharge it.

The non-lethal weapon was out of its 
holster, prompting speculation that one of them had grabbed it before 
being killed in the gun and grenade attack.

But
the gun and grenade attack happened so suddenly and quickly that 
officers doubt that the pair had any chance to defend themselves.

Residents reported hearing 13 gun shots before an explosion.

A Taser fires barbed darts with copper cables attached which paralyse suspects for a short time.

The scene remained sealed off today as forensics officers continued in their task of recovering fragments of a grenade which was used in the attack.

The head of Greater Manchester Police said his officers remained at risk as he could not be sure that all explosive devices had been removed from the area.

Heartbroken: The police force and the community have been devastated by the deaths of the two young policewomen, who were on duty when they died

Chief Constable Sir Peter Fahy said: ‘We are not confident that we have recovered all the grenades, we don’t know for certain, so we’ve made it clear to our officers that the threat is still there.'

The killings have reignited a debate over whether British police officers should be routinely armed.

The brother of shot Pc David Rathband and the widower of murdered Pc Sharon Beshenivsky have both called for guns to be given to police.

Darren Rathband, whose brother was blinded after being shot by gunman Raoul Moat in Newcastle-upon Tyne in July 2010, said: 'How many officers need to die before the powers realise it is the 21st century?

‘No job is a routine job and there is always the potential for conflict. We don’t go on jobs where people are happy to see us.

‘I am angry some other families have now lost a daughter, sister, mother or wife and it makes me angry that the thin blue line is getting thinner and thinner.'

Paul Beshenivsky, whose wife was gunned down when she attended a botched burglary in Bradford, West Yorkshire, in 2005, said: 'I think policing, as regarding going to scenes of crimes, should be monitored better, and I think police, in honesty, should be armed, walking into situations that they’re not totally aware of.

'You can’t have armed response at every situation, but I think, as an officer being armed, walk into a situation, feeling more comfortable, walking into that situation, thinking, "I could respond to that situation".'

The demands have been rejected by senior officers, however, and Home Secretary Theresa May agreed that police should not be routinely armed.

She said: 'The Home Office have been supporting Greater Manchester Police in the work that they've been doing in relation to this case over the past week and will continue to do so.

'I'm clear that every resource that GMP needs should be made available to it and forces across the country have been giving support in the work that GMP are doing.

'I think we are clear we have a British model of policing that is one that our police very much support.

'I think that routine unarmed policing that goes on in our streets is right. I don't think this is the time to be calling for the arming of police.'

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
