A schools superintendent near Boston is losing a week's worth of pay after a student caught him plagiarizing portions of his graduation speech from one given weeks earlier by the Massachusetts governor.

David Fleishman, who heads Newton Public Schools, will see his $254,000 salary reduced by $4,890 for blatantly stealing some five lines from Gov. Deval Patrick without proper attribution and using them in two of his addresses to graduates in his district, according to the Boston Globe.

One student, Jordan Cohen-Kaplan, was at Boston University on May 18 when the governor delivered his speech with lines such as: 'Real human connection, the nuance of empathy and understanding, is often more gradual and elongated than Twitter.'

Caught! David Fleishman, who heads Newton Public Schools in Massachusetts, will see his salary docked by $4,890 after two students caught him lifting sections from a recent speech by the state governor and using them at graduation

Then on June 9, at the Newton South High 
School commencement, Cohen-Kaplan was surprised to hear Fleishman boldly
 tell graduates: 'Lastly, personal connection, the nuance of empathy and
 understanding, is often more incremental and complex than Twitter.'

He started investigating with fellow graduate Kylie Walters — and took the principal to task on the student newspaper.

'It
 is disappointing and disillusioning to imagine that we cannot expect 
the best from the highest ranking Newton public schools officials, 
especially on a widely-attributed day designed to celebrate student 
achievement and serve as an education capstone,' Cohen-Kaplan and Walters wrote jointly on The Lion's Roar.

Fleishman told the Globe that he'd heard the governor's speech on the radio and used the passages  from memory, without seeing a written transcript. He refused to say whether what he did constituted plagiarism but assumed responsibility for the incident.

'In my judgment, it is essential that public officials not only accept critical feedback but acknowledge when we have made mistakes,' he told the paper.

Gov. Deval Patrick of Massachusetts delivered his speech at Boston University with lines that were later plagiarized, such as: 'Real human connection, the nuance of empathy and understanding, is often more gradual and elongated than Twitter'
