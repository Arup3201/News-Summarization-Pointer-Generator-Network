A Scotland Yard police officer was executed on a charity trip to Kenya after bandits ambushed his bus - and found his force ID, it has been claimed.

Special Constable Jamal Moghe, 26, was travelling to a rural school, about 150 miles north of Nairobi, where he was arranging to send old UK laptops to pupils when the ruthless hijackers struck.

The mob of 12 gunmen stormed through the coach demanding that each of the 70 passengers on board empty their luggage and hand over their valuables.

But when they got to SPC Moghe, they were startled to see his Met identification card fall out of his bag and opened fire, his heartbroken family claim. Nobody else on the bus was hurt in the raid.

They also stole an expensive camera and and a bag of clothes from him before riddling him with bullets.

His best friend Shil Abdiaziz, who pulled out of the trip at the last minute, told The Sun: 'We believe they found his Met Police ID card - it spooked them and thatâ€™s why he was the only one shot and killed.'

Kenyan police say they have tracked down and killed six of the bandits, believed to be from neighbouring Ethiopia.

Pc Moghe, who worked as a only married sweetheart Sudi in London a year ago, moved to the UK from war-torn Somalia when he was in his teens.

This was said to be his first trip back to Africa since he fled the continent more than a decade ago.

His uncle Abdullah Ali told The Sun that SPC Moghe idolised double Olympic gold medalist and fellow Somali-born Brit Mo Farah and was elated to work on traffic duty at the Olympic Park during the Games.

His distraught widow, Sudi, who ran a children's charity with him near their home in Wembley, North London, said said: 'Being a policeman and doing charity work was his dream.'

His funeral was held in Nairobi yesterday, as is custom in Islam to bury a body within a day of death.

Today, a colleague paid tribute to Jamal on a police website.

They wrote: 'I am a colleague of Jamal and have worked with him.

'He put a lot of effort in helping combat Gun and Knife crime, by providing talks and physically hitting the streets.

'He worked with the youth and provided a positive role model to the Somali community.

'RIP Jamal.'

Ealing borough commander Andy Rowell 
paid tribute to the exhibits officer, saying: 'We were all shocked and 
saddened to hear of Jamal's death.

'He was a popular member of the team at Ealing borough, and he also chose to serve his community by volunteering as a special.

'Our thoughts are with his wife and family at this time.'

A Scotland Yard spokesman said: 'The MPS is saddened to hear of the death of a Special Constable on a visit to Africa.

'Jamal was a member of police staff at a west London police station, and also worked as a Special on Brent Borough.

'We understand he was shot and killed in Kenya on January 12.'
