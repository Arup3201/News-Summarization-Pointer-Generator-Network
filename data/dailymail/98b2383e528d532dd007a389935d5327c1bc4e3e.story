Entrepreneur: Fernando Caignet Aguilera, pictured here in a booking photo from 2012, was cited on December 10 for capturing and attempting to sell the alligator

A Florida man has been cited after he tried to trade a live alligator for beer at a convenience store in Miami.

Fernando Caignet Aguilera, 64, was caught on video with the gator at the Santa Ana Market at 3000 Northwest 12th Avenue on December 10.

Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission spokesman Jorge Pino said the man received a citation for illegally capturing and trying to sell the gator.

Pino told WTVJ-TV Aguilera trapped the 4-foot-long gator at a nearby park, where he was sleeping rough, put it in a cardboard box and brought it to the store.

He proposed to trade the animal for a 12-pack of beer but the store clerk refused and called authorities.

A tattooed Aguilera can be seen on the one-and-a-half minute video, trying to persuade the clerk to take up his unique offer as other customers mill around curiously.

Later, he attempted to sell he animal to people outside the store but there were no takers.

'This is absolutely bizarre,' Pino told WTVJ-TV.

'I can't imagine somebody wanting to barter a live four-foot alligator for a 12 pack of beer, it makes no sense to me.'

Miami police arrived and called Fish and Wildlife officers who took the alligator from Aguilera.

He was cited for illegally capturing, possessing and trying to sell the creature and released from custody on a promise to appear.

Thankfully, the gator wasn't hurt in the barter attempt.

Dangerous: Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission officials warned the 4-foot alligator, pictured, was still dangerous despite its size

'It was pretty much in good shape, we didn't notice any unusual conditions on it,' Pino said. The alligator was released back into the wild.

Pino also warned people that even a small alligator can be dangerous to people not trained to handle reptiles.

He added to the Tampa Tribune: 'This is one of the most unique cases I have handled, but nothing surprises me in the city of Miami.'
