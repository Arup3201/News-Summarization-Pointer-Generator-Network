The devastated family of two toddlers allegedly stabbed-to-death by their mother because she thought they were possessed by the devil has spoken out about the shocking deaths.

'I just can't understand why things like that happen,' the children's paternal great-grandmother, Ida Johnson, told MailOnline Sunday night. 'They were the sweetest things.'

One-year-old Norell Harris and his 2-year-old sister, Zyana, were found dead in the beds of their Germantown, Maryland home Friday morning.

Their mother, Zakieya Avery, 28, faces two counts of first-degree murder and two counts of attempted murder after her two older children, 5-year-old Taniya Harris and 8-year-old Martello Harris, survived what police are calling an exorcism.

Horrific: Officers responded to Zakieya Avery's Germantown home Friday morning and found little Norell Harris, right, and his 2-year-old sister Zyana Harris, front left, dead in a disturbing, blood-splattered crime scene. The older siblings, pictured, were rushed to hospital and survived

Johnson, 90, said she last saw the 
children when they came to stay with her and her granddaughter, Atraia 
Johnson, in their Philadelphia home over the holidays.

'I
 will cherish those memories forever,' she told MailOnline. 'Their lives
 were cut short and they had no say so whatsoever. It doesn't make 
sense.'

She said the children's father, her grandson, Martin Luther Harris Jr. has traveled to 
the Children's National Medical Center in Washington D.C. to be with his
 surviving son and daughter who were both listed in stable condition 
Sunday.

Johnson said she didn't know if Avery had a history of violence or when the woman's relationship with Harris deteriorated.

'I don't know what was going on between the family, all I know is they were sweet kids,' she said.

Infanticide: Zakieya Latrice Averyhas been charged with murder in the deaths of two of her children, a 1-year-old and a 2-year-old

The
 great-grandmother added: 'It's heartbreaking. Something should be done 
about who did it. But at the same time, it's not going to bring the 
children back. I just hope they get (what they deserve).'

According to Montgomery County police captain Marcus Jones, Avery told detectives she 'thought the devil was in the kids.'

'That's
 sort of the thing she centered it around as to why she had to conduct 
an exorcism,' he said. 'She just thought that there were evil spirits 
within the kids.'

Officers 
responded to Avery's home Friday morning following a neighbor's 911 call
 and found little Norell and Zyana dead in a disturbing, 
blood-splattered crime scene. Taniya and Martello were found injured with stabbing wounds.

Avery's stepgrandmother, Sylvia Wade, told The Washington Post that Avery was 'humble and meek' and said she loved her children.

'I
 don't know what triggered it,' she said. 'She wasn't herself. When a 
person is not of themselves, they are not responsible for what they are 
doing. They are in another zone.'

Tragedy: Zakieya Latrice Avery, 28 (for right), has been charged in the stabbing deaths of two of her kids, a 1-year-old and a 2-year-old (pictured left and right)

Startling change: Police arrested Monifa Denise Sanford, 21 (pictured at her arrest at right and earlier at left) Saturday following her release from a hospital and charged her with two counts of first degree murder and two counts of attempted first degree murder

Another
 woman charged in the killings, Monifa Denise Sanford, 21, made similar 
statements about evil spirits during questioning, police said. The two 
women had been living together at the house in recent months.

Jones said the women are believed to have met each other at a church, which he identified as Exousia Ministries in Germantown.

The
 pastor of that congregation, Darryl Jones, declined to discuss the case
 after services at an elementary school Sunday or even confirm that the 
women worshipped there.

'This
 is a tragic situation. We're keeping the family in (our) prayers and we
 are respecting the privacy of the family,' he said.

Both
 women were being held without bond on charges of first-degree murder 
and attempted first-degree murder and are not expected to appear in 
court until Tuesday afternoon. Court records do not list lawyers for the
 women.

Sinister ritual: Norell Harris, a 1-year-old boy (second left), and Zyana Harris, a 2-year-old girl (third left), were found dead in Germantown, Maryland, Friday, while their older siblings (pictured) suffered multiple stab wounds during what was described as an exorcism

Unthinkable: The tragedy unfolded at around 9.30am Friday when police officers responded to a home in the 1900 block of Cherry Bend Drive, where they came upon a 'very bloody scene' involving six people (Sanford among them), four of them children under the age of 10

Grisly sight: Police who went into a home in Germantown on Friday morning encountered a 'very bloody scene' and discovered two children dead, and two other children and a woman injured

Martin Luther
 Harris Jr. relocated to Los Angeles after he separated from Avery.

His mother, Alonda Lord, changed her Facebook profile to a picture of the four children Saturday.

Under the adorable photo are scores of condolences from friends and family.

A cousin, Dean Smithwick, wrote: 'Such a tragedy and huge losses, Lonnie you have my condolences cuz. Keeping you all in my prayers. Love you cuz!!!'

A 
neighbor called 911 after noticing a vehicle with the door open and a 
bloody knife laying outside of the vehicle.

Avery was arrested when authorities say she tried to flee from a 
townhouse near the vehicle. Police found the two children dead inside 
the home, and their siblings and Sanford were taken to the hospital with
 injuries.

Police said Sanford was arrested Saturday after being released from the hospital.

The tragedy unfolded at around 9.30 a.m. Friday when police officers responded to a home in the 1900 block of Cherry Bend Drive, where they came upon a 'very bloody scene' involving six people, four of them children under the age of 10. 

The two youngest children were pronounced dead at the scene.

Horrific detail: According to reports, the children may have been sleeping in their rooms when they were stabbed

NBC Washington reported that the children were found in the bedrooms and may have been stabbed in their sleep.

'Cases like this are heartbreaking' said Montgomery County Police Chief Tom Manger. 'Our thoughts are with the family and friends of the victims along with the 911 operators, police officers, evidence technicians, and fire and EMS personnel that responded,' according to the station WUSA9.

According to her Facebook page, Avery lives with her family in Gaithersburg, Maryland, and works as a pharmacy technician.  

Most recently, she wished happy New Year to her family on January 2. In mid-November, the 28-year-old indicated that she was in a new relationship.
