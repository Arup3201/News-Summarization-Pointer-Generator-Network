Unlicensed: Pennsylvania authorities seized 2,447 bottles from the home of attorneys Arthur Goldman, 50, that they are planning to destroy

Pennsylvania state police were tied up for months in a sting operation that ended with a 20-hour raid in early January.

As law professor Baylen Linnekin writes in Reason, the target wasn't illegal narcotics but a cellar full of rare and expensive bottles of wine.

2,447 bottles, to be exact. They are worth more than $160,000. 

Officers seized the bottles from the Malvern home of attorneys Arthur Goldman and Melissa Kurtzman, and state they are now planning to destroy the collection.

The state's strict liquor laws led law enforcement to Goldman, who insists he was not looking to sell off his collection and that the bottles were only for his private consumption.

The case began with an 'anonymous complaint' in March 2013 to Pennsylvania's Bureau of Liquor Control Enforcement that Goldman was selling wine without a license.

The agency dispatched an undercover officer to 'infiltrate' a mailing list, which offered access to exclusive California wineries that Goldman had cultivated relationships with.

The email list allowed friends and colleagues to pool orders for wine, which Goldman would place and receive at his residence, then in New Jersey, before distributing them.

According to court filings, Goldman never charged any fees or profited from the email list, and all costs for wine, taxes and shipping were shared by any buyers. 

Bloomberg reports that Goldman emailed the agent a 97-page list of bottles available for purchase, which offered wines from elite, small-batch wineries, most of which were not available to buy in Pennsylvania.

The undercover officer made a 'buy' in one of these exclusive wine pools, then was later joined by two other officers posing as his stepdaughter and her fiance.

Goldman and Kurtzman moved to Pennsylvania later in 2013, taking their wine cellar with them, and were soon called on by the undercover officers.

The man gave the agents a tour of his wine cellar and poured out glasses of wine for them to taste.

The undercover family told a story of looking to buy wine as a wedding gift. Goldman then sold four or five bottles, allegedly at cost, to the agents.

A raid followed in January, in which the agency seized Goldman's collection, valued at $160,000, which the couple is fighting to recover before the state destroys it.

Lawyers for Goldman and Kurtzman argue that the collection was not part of a liquor-selling operation but rather a 'personal wine collection.'

Goldman entered a first-offender program for the charges of buying alcohol outside the state system and selling liquor without a license, and now must complete two years probation and 300 hours of community service. 

Linnekin notes Pennsylvania's harsh liquor laws require wine aficionados shopping on the internet to have their purchases 'shipped to the Wine & Spirits Store of their choice' instead of to their homes.

The laws also bar buyers from purchasing any bottles online that could be bought at the state-run package stores. Additional restrictions are placed on those traveling liquor through the state.
