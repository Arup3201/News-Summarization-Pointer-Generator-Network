Warning: Headteacher Nicole Chapman says some parents praise their daughters too much

Parents are turning their daughters into ‘little princesses’ who can’t take criticism, the head teacher of a leading girls’ grammar school warned yesterday.

Nicole Chapman said some families treat daughters as if they ‘can do no wrong’ and constantly shower them with praise and presents,

As a result, many lack the ‘resilience’ to deal with failure or criticism, she said.

Mrs Chapman, who is head of one of the best selective schools in the country, spoke out ahead of a conference at her school in Chelmsford, Essex - attended by parents and other school leaders - about educating teenage girls.

‘What I try to address with my parents here is the concept of what we call the little princess, which is one where a child, once she’s satisfied her parents’ ambitions to get into the school, she can do no wrong,’ she said,

‘She’s constantly praised - and that is not necessarily a good thing.’

Mrs Chapman, who has a grown-up son, said that ‘the little princess’ always wants to please and gets ‘a lot of rewards’ for her troubles.

She said: ‘For some of them it’s just praise, but with others they can have more or less what they want.

‘Their parents shower them with presents.’

She said some parents ‘never exposed’ their daughters to any negative feedback.

This made girls into ‘perfectionists’ who would not take risks in case they failed.

Instead
of excessive praise, she said, parents should ensure their daughters 
were ‘strong individuals’ who could cope with failure and grow up to be 
leaders.

‘Our girls are bright and therefore, they will be leaders,’ she said.

‘As a leader, you’re not a princess. As a leader, you’ve got to have strength, belief, resilience.

‘You have to have the right principles - you must be principled, but you must have knowledge.

‘All those things don’t necessarily go with being a princess because a princess is a bit fragile.

‘A princess receives information, learns it, regurgitates it, but never gets truly challenged.’

Mrs Chapman is head of the 900-pupil Chelmsford County High School for Girls, where 88 per cent of pupils pass their GCSEs with As or A*s last summer.

Her comments were echoed by Dr JoAnn Deak, author of Girls Will Be Girls: Raising Confident and Courageous Daughters.

Speaking at the conference yesterday, 
she said many parents ‘tend to go overboard on praise’, making girls 
‘feel precious’ and that they’re ‘the centre of the universe’.

Praise should be ‘specific and earned’ instead, she said.

Referring
to daughters, the American psychologist said: ‘As a parent, you’ll 
obviously offer general praise to her sometimes, but if you do it too 
often, your opinion will not be valued.

‘Remember
too, that the more she focuses on self, the more selfish she will 
become; whereas the more she focuses on doing and on others, the more 
she will increase her self esteem.’

Earlier this month a leading psychologist warned that praising children with phrases such as ‘well done darling’ could damage their confidence.

Stephen Grosz says ‘empty praise’ such as ‘you’re so clever’ or ‘you’re such an artist’ could cause children to be unhappy as they feel they cannot live up to the false expectations, and can even hinder their progress at school.

Mr Grosz - who has practised as a psychoanalyst, a type of psychologist, for 25 years - cites research showing that children who were heavily praised were likely to perform worse in maths problems and even tended to lie about their results.

Instead he advises parents and teachers to bestow compliments less frequently and use phrases that congratulate children for ‘trying really hard’.
