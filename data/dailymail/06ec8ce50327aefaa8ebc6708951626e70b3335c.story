Just days before Josh Densten celebrated his 27th birthday his whole life was turned upside down

Just days before Josh Densten celebrated his 27th birthday his whole life was turned upside down.

Diagnosed with adult-onset type 1 diabetes, The Block contestant thought life would never be the same as he tried to process the shocking news given to him by his local Doctor in Melbourne nearly a year and a half ago.

Rather than letting the diagnosis bring him down, Josh, who is now 28, vowed to take a positive approach and has committed himself to educating others on the condition.

'There are a lot of worse things that could have happened and I am lucky to have been diagnosed later in life,' Josh told Daily Mail Australia.  

But that was not the Melbourne plumber's initial reaction to his life-threatening condition.  

Having never known anyone with diabetes and having no awareness of the condition, it took five weeks before Josh took warning signs seriously.

'At the start it was very gradual', he said. 'I was very thirsty and it got worse and worse until it was unquenchable. 

'I was urinating quite a lot because it was my body's way of releasing my high blood sugar - I was drinking litres of water every 10 minutes.' 

By the time Josh went to the Doctor his blood sugar levels were at 35, when recommended blood sugar levels are generally between four and eight.

'The Doctor told me I made it just in time', Josh said. 'In a few more weeks it could have been really serious.

'Luckily there was no damage to my kidneys and eyes'.  

Type 1 diabetes occurs when the pancreas stops making insulin,  preventing the body from turning sugar into energy. If sufferers do not treat themselves with daily injections of insulin, the condition could potentially be life threatening.

Unlike type 2 diabetes, Josh's condition has no cause but can often be linked to family history.

When Josh, 28, was first diagnosed with type 1 diabetes he thought he would never be able to do the things he loved again, like eating a burger or drinking a beer 

When Josh first discovered he had type 1 diabetes he was in complete shock - diabetes did not run in his family.

'I asked the doctor, "How do I get rid of it?" - I wasn't aware of what diabetes was, I didn't know anything about it.

Josh and his wife Jenna were both contestants on Channel 9's reality show, The Block, in 2011 and 2013 

'They said, "You can't get rid of it, you'll have it the rest of your life". 

'It was hard for me, I was thinking, "Can I ever do the things I love again?".

'Playing sport, drinking beer or even going for a burger - all the things I thought I could never do because I had no information about diabetes.'

Although there is no cure for type 1 diabetes, Josh discovered it is very manageable.

Through maintaining a healthy lifestyle, regularly testing his blood glucose levels and injecting himself with insulin, Josh describes living a life that is close to 'normal'.

'I now have to have about five to six injections a day - I'm not a huge fan of needles but after a year and a half I have become used to it.

'To be honest, nothing has changed but I am a bit more cautious,' he said.

'If I am going down the street I need to make sure I have lollies on me - if I don't I am always freaking out - I am worried my blood sugar is going to drop and I will black out.

'I also DJ on the side and in front of hundreds of people I worry about that. 

'If anything having diabetes has pushed me to do more exercise, travel more and enjoy life.' 

Josh said he considers himself fortunate when compared to the 'five-year-old-boys who are woken up by their mothers in the middle of the night for insulin shots because they are too young to tackle it alone.' 

The Block star puts his strength down to the support of his wife Jenna and his mum, who has Google alerts for diabetes on her phone. 

Most weekends Josh and Jenna, who appeared on The Block in 2011 and 2013, stay active by walking into Melbourne's city, rather than driving their car.

'I am also really lucky to be a plumber because it keeps me active and I am able to have regular and organised meals.

Josh walks his little dogs everyday to stay active, whether its going for a run around the block or taking them to the park close by

'I try to ride my bike or walk to work as much as I can and I also have little dogs so if I am sitting on the couch they always make me feel guilty,' he said.

Josh, who is an ambassador for Diabetes Australia, is urging people to take part in the Walk to Work Day campaign.

The campaign  encourages people to get walking and raise awareness on the benefits of exercise  to help reduce the risk of diabetes, together with healthy eating.

The end of the campaign will also mark World Diabetes Day on Friday 14 November, when Australian's are asked to walk at least one kilometre of their journey to work that day.

'I think it is a good idea to plant the seed that people don't have drive to work all the time or even for them to just learn to get off one train stop earlier.

'Even though I ride to work and it is a lot quicker, when I walk I can actually enjoy my time, unwind and see people, rather than just staring at your phone on the train.' 

Josh hopes this campaign can help spread awareness across Australia and raise money to help find a cure.

'Ideally it would be great to find a cure, but for now I just want people to know how deadly it can be and how important it is to stay active and healthy,' Josh said.

Diabetes Australia estimates that 1.7 million Australians suffer from diabetes, while half of the cases of type 2 diabetes remain undiagnosed.

Around 280 Australians develop diabetes everyday and more than 100,000 Australians have developed the condition in the past year.

Type 1 diabetes:

*Occurs when the pancreas does not produce insulin

*Represents 10–15 per cent of all cases of diabetes

*Is one of the most common chronic childhood conditions

*Onset is usually abrupt and symptoms are obvious

*Symptoms can include excessive thirst and urination, unexplained weight loss, weakness and fatigue and blurred vision

Type 2 diabetes:

*Occurs when the pancreas does not produce enough insulin and/or the insulin does not work effectively and/or the cells of the body do not respond to insulin effectively (known as insulin resistance)

*Represents 85–90 per cent of all cases of diabetes

*Usually develops in adults over the age of 45 years but is increasingly occurring in younger age groups including children, adolescents and young adults

*Is more likely in people with a family history of type 2 diabetes or from particular ethnic backgrounds

*For some the first sign may be a complication of diabetes such as a heart attack, vision problems or a foot ulcer

*Is managed with a combination of regular physical activity, healthy eating and weight reduction. As type 2 diabetes is often progressive, most people will need oral medications and/or insulin injections in addition to lifestyle changes over time.
