Body of Benjamin Colton Barnes spotted by helicopter face down in snow in remote area

Barnes, 24, was tracked in Mount Rainier Park

Also wanted for shooting of four people at New Year's Eve Party in Seattle

An armed Iraq War veteran suspected of killing a Mount Rainier National Park ranger managed to evade snowshoe-wearing SWAT teams and dogs on his trail for nearly a day. He couldn't, however, escape chest-deep snow.

A plane searching the remote wilderness for Benjamin Colton Barnes, 24, on Monday discovered his body lying face down on the mountain hours from where authorities could get to him.

Barnes is believed to have fled to the remote park on Sunday to hide after an earlier shooting at a New Year's house party near Seattle that wounded four, two critically. Authorities suspect he shot ranger Margaret Anderson later on Sunday.

Victim: Benjamin Colton Barnes (R) was said to have shot dead Margaret Anderson, a mother of two young daughters, at the national park near Seattle

SWAT teams more used to urban standoffs trekked deep into the backcountry, unfamiliar territory for them.

'We have SWAT team members with 
snowshoes on the side of a mountain,' Pierce County Sheriff's spokesman 
Ed Troyer said. 'This has never happened before.'

Immediately after Sunday's shooting, police cleared out the park of visitors and mounted a manhunt.

Fear that tourists could be caught in
 the crossfire in a shootout with Barnes, who had survivalist training, 
prompted officials to hold more than a 100 people at the visitors' centre before evacuating them in the middle of the night.

Barnes, who was believed to be 
carrying a cache of weapons, has had a troubled transition to civilian 
life, with accusations he suffers post-traumatic stress disorder and is 
suicidal.

He was involved in a custody dispute 
in Tacoma July, during which his toddler daughter's mother sought a 
temporary restraining order against him, according to court documents.

The woman told authorities he was 
suicidal and possibly suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder after
 deploying to Iraq in 2007-2008, and had once sent her a text message 
saying 'I want to die.'

She alleged that he gets easily 
irritated, angry and depressed and keeps an arsenal of weapons in his 
home. She wrote that she feared for the child's safety. Undated photos 
provided by police showed a shirtless, tattooed Barnes brandishing two 
large weapons.

In November 2011, a guardian ad litem
 recommended parenting and communication classes for both parents and 
recommending Barnes be allowed to continue supervised visits with the 
child, two days a week.

That visitation schedule was to 
continue until he completed a domestic violence evaluation and mental 
health evaluation and complied with all treatment recommendations.

Late Sunday police said Barnes was a suspect in another shooting incident.

On New Year's, there was an argument 
at a house party in Skyway, south of Seattle, and gunfire erupted, 
police said. Four people in their 20s were reported injured, two 
critically. Barnes was connected to the shooting, said Sgt Cindi West, 
King County Sheriff's spokeswoman.

It is believed that the man had been 
asked to leave after an argument over a gun. The man came back with a 
weapon and opened fire on the crowd, according to police.

Police believe Barnes headed to the 
remote park wilderness to 'hide out' following the Skyway shooting. 
There were children present in the home at the time of the shooting.

'The speculation is that he may have 
come up here, specifically for that reason, to get away,' parks 
spokesman Kevin Bacher told reporters early Monday. 'The speculation is 
he threw some stuff in the car and headed up here to hide out.'

Mrs Anderson had set up a roadblock 
on Sunday morning to stop a man who had blown through a checkpoint 
rangers use to check if vehicles have tire chains for winter conditions.
 A gunman opened fire on her before she was able to exit her vehicle, 
authorities say.

Before fleeing, the gunman fired shots at both Anderson and the ranger that trailed him, but only Anderson was hit.

Mrs Anderson would have been armed, 
as she was one of the rangers tasked with law enforcement, parks 
spokesman Kevin Bacher said. Troyer said she was shot before she had 
even got out of the vehicle.

Park superintendent Randy King said 
Anderson, a 34-year-old mother of two young girls who was married to 
another Rainier ranger, had served as a park ranger for about four 
years.

King said Anderson's husband also was working as a ranger elsewhere in the park at the time of the shooting.

Mrs Anderson graduated from Westfield
 High School, New Jersey in 1995 and fulfilled her dream of becoming a 
park ranger, according to local newspaper the Westfield Patch.

She met her husband through work and they married in 2005. The couple had two daughters, Anna, three, and one-year-old Katie.

Adam Norton, a neighbour of 
Anderson's in the small town of Eatonville, Washington, said the 
ranger's family moved in about a year ago.

He said they were not around much, 
but when they were Norton would see Anderson outside with her girls. 
'They just seemed like the perfect family,' he said.

The town of about 3,000 residents, which is a logging community overlooking Mount Rainier, is very close knit, he said.

'It's really sad right now,' Norton said. 'We take care of each other.'

Police have been in contact with 
Barnes' family, trying to have them coax him to 'come to the police and 
tell his side of the story'.

The shooting has meanwhile renewed 
debate about a federal law that made it legal for people to take loaded 
weapons into national parks. The 2010 law made possession of firearms 
subject to state gun laws.

Bill Wade, the outgoing chair of the 
Coalition of National Park Service Retirees, said Congress should be 
regretting its decision.

'The many congressmen and senators 
that voted for the legislation that allowed loaded weapons to be brought
 into the parks ought to be feeling pretty bad right now,' said Wade.

Wade called Sunday's fatal shooting a
 tragedy that could have been prevented. He hopes Congress will 
reconsider the law that took effect in early 2010, but doubts that will 
happen in today's political climate.

Calls and emails to the National Rifle Association requesting comment were not immediately returned on Monday.

The NRA said media fears of gun 
violence in parks were unlikely to be realised, the NRA wrote in a 
statement about the law after it went into effect. 'The new law affects 
firearms possession, not use,' it said.

The group pushed for the law saying people have a right to defend themselves against park animals and other people.

Bacher, the parks spokesman, said 
surviving overnight in the open on Rainier is difficult, but not 
impossible for a person with gear and skills. He added that authorities 
wouldn't shed tears if Colton didn't survive.

'I don't think any of us would be sorry if he was not in a condition to fire on our searchers this morning,' Bacher said.
