A 20-year-old father from New York was stabbed to death on Saturday near children who were playing a Little League baseball game.

James Moran asked for help from spectators at the game after he was chased towards the field and then stabbed.

Police have charged 28-year-old Michael Grusel with manslaughter after Mr Moran, who had a two-year-old daughter, died in hospital.

Attack: James Moran was stabbed outside Babylon Little League's field, as children were preparing for a game

Off-duty police officer Fred Bothe, and spectators at the baseball game, helped restrain the alleged attacker as he tried to flee.

Detectives say the fight, which happened at about noon in Babylon, was not related to the Little League match.

Police are investigating claims that Grusel may have been acting in self-defense after witnesses claimed he had been robbed by Moran.

'He’s a young kid, very quiet individual,' one witness told CBS New York, as he claimed that Grusel had been protecting himself.

The stabbing took place in the street close to where coaches and parents were getting children ready for a game.

The
 victim, Mr Moran, was described by his father as 'carefree'. He had 
been working at restaurants to save up for his wedding, and so he could 
move to Florida with his family.
