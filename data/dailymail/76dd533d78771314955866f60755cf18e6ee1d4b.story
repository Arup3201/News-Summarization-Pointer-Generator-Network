A Canadian National Railway Company freight train carrying flammable products derailed in central Saskatchewan Tuesday and became engulfed in flames, causing the evacuation of a nearby town.

The Saskatchewan government said the accident happened near the small community of Clair. About 50 people were forced to leave their homes. 

Provincial officials said hazardous materials crews were en route. CN spokesman Jim Feeny said the fire is coming from petroleum distillate, which spilled from two of the derailed cars. Petroleum distillates are often made into diesel, kerosene, heating oil and jet fuel.

Smash-up: A Canadian National Railway Company freight train carrying dangerous goods derailed and caught fire near the town of Wadena, Saskatchewan, Tuesday

Twisted metal: The train was made up of three locomotives pulling 100 cars and that 26 of them derailed

Fireball: A witness told a local radio station that the flames are at least 100 feet high

Dangerous goods: Six cars were carrying petroleum distillate, hydrochloric acid and caustic soda

'The cars of concern contain petroleum distillate. They spilled and that is the source of the fire,' Feeny said.

Feeny said the crew is not injured. He said the train was made up of three locomotives pulling 100 cars and that 26 of them derailed Tuesday morning. 

Sixty of the cars were empty and forty were carrying goods including six carrying dangerous goods. Besides the two carrying petroleum distillate two were carrying hydrochloric acid and two were carrying caustic soda.

The train originated in Winnipeg, Manitoba and was traveling to Saskatoon, Saskatchewan.

A witness told a local radio station that the flames are at least 100 feet high.

Alison Squires, the publisher of the local Wadena News, visited the site of the derailment and told The Canadian Press that she has never seen anything like it.

'When I got there, there was a small explosion,' she recalled. 'The smoke is too thick to see what cars are involved.' 

Canada's Transportation Safety Board said it is deploying a team of investigators to the site.

As of Tuesday evening, the petroleum fire has diminished but was still raging. 

Evacuation: The accident happened near the small community of Clair, were about 50 people were forced to leave their homes

Journey: The train originated in Winnipeg, Manitoba and was traveling to Saskatoon, Saskatchewan

Spared: The crew of the doomed freight train escaped the crash unharmed 

Train derailments are more of a concern in Canada after a runaway oil train exploded in the Quebec town of Lac-Megantic just across the U.S.-Canada border in July 2013, killing 47 people.

That oil train was carrying oil from Bakken crude from North Dakota. Officials have said Bakken's sweet, light crude may be more flammable than traditional, heavier forms of crude oil because it can ignite at a lower temperature.

Canadian Transport Minister Lisa Raitt said she was aware of the Saskatchewan derailment and said her government has done "tremendous work on rail safety."
