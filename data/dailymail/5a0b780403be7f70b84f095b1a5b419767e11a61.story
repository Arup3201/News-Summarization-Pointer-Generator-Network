Humiliation: Robert Pattinson, seen here with Kristen Stewart at last Sunday's Teen Choice Awards is said to be 'devastated' and 'completely hurt'

He is reported to have packed his bags
and left the LA mansion he shared with girlfriend Kristen Stewart 
following the news she cheated on him with married director Rupert 
Sanders.

But despite 
Kristen’s very public apology regarding her ‘momentary indiscretion,’ 
Robert Pattinson is reported to be in two minds about giving his 
Twilight co-star a second chance.

A source close to the star told The UK Mirror: ‘Rob is devastated and deeply hurt. They spoke on the phone and he said “You’ve completely humiliated me.”

‘All the trust has gone.’

The
source said that the 26-year-old British actor ‘couldn’t believe what 
he was hearing’ when Kristen told him the fling was just a ‘one off.’

It's
unclear exactly when Robert found out about the 22-year-old's affair 
with the Snow White and the Huntsman director, who has two children with 
British model Liberty Ross.

Kristen
and Rupert were photographed in the throes of passion on July 17 but 
the images did not surface in the media until two days ago.

And
while Kristen and her married director paramour have both issued 
grovelling apologies for their exposed affair, Robert has remained 
resolutely silent.

The source told the Mirror that it was‘furious ‘ Robert who demanded Kristen apologise and she agreed.

'Robert wanted the world to know that he hadn’t done 
anything wrong and that she had made a fool of him publicly,' said the insider.

'He still can’t fathom why she cheated. Kristen is begging for another chance. Robert is undecided.'

The actress released a statement yesterday saying: 'I’m deeply sorry for the hurt and embarrassment I’ve caused.

'This
momentary indiscretion has jeopardised the most important thing in my 
life, the person I love and respect the most, Rob. I love him, I love 
him, I’m so sorry.'

Out: The actor is understood to have pack his bags and left the LA home they share

The couple were last seen in public at the Teen Choice Awards together on July 22 looking like a decidedly happy couple. 

But fellow attendees back stage at the ceremony detected some tension between them away from cameras, with a source telling the New York Post:
'Rob and Kristen were having a long and intense conversation backstage,
and he looked miserable, heartbroken and humiliated. She was pleading.'

The actor made his feelings regarding
infidelity clear in April, telling Vanity Fair: 'There's a thing I've 
never got: That is, why do people cheat?'

Keeping her secret: The pair enjoyed a night out in Hollywood on July 19... two days after her tryst with the director

He explained that while he 'can 
understand the impulse' to cheat, he doesn't comprehend 'how you can 
keep two relationships going at the same time for long.'

Should Robert Pattinson forgive Kristen Stewart for cheating?

'I'm not the casual-affair kind of 
guy,' he said. 'If I choose to be with someone, it's because I really 
want it. When I have a relationship, I'm 100 percent into it.'

The star has not emerged since details of the dalliance hit the press.

Us Weekly detailed the liaison, with a source saying Rupert was 'all over' Kristen.

Another source added they 'would only take a 
break [from kissing] when they thought someone was walking by.'

A photographer followed Kristen from her Los Feliz home and
when the actress pulled into the parking lot of a deserted building and
Rupert got into her car.

The source explained: 'It seemed like they couldn't get enough. Kristen 
was sitting up with her back against the driver's-side window, and this 
guy was kissing her entire body.'

Taking direction: Kristen and Rupert seen chatting in between takes on the set of Snow White And The Huntsman

The pair left when they thought they were being watched and drove to an 
area near the Hollywood sign and Kristen appeared 'swept up in the 
moment' as they kissed and cuddled outside the car.

While the area they were in was quite deserted, they were disturbed by 
some dog walkers and each time 'as soon as they heard a voice, they 
would split up and walk in opposite directions'.

Meanwhile,
the young heartthrobs new movie The Rover has been given the green 
light by Screen Australia, according to The Hollywood Reporter.

Set
in the Australian desert, The Rover is a futuristic western that 'tells
the story of Eric (Guy Pearce), who has left everything, everyone and 
every semblance of human kindness behind him, as he’s forced to join an 
injured gang member, Rey (Pattinson), to hunt down Rey’s gang after they
steal the last of Eric’s possessions.'

Charlize Theron and Lily Cole, at the London premiere of the movie last 
month
