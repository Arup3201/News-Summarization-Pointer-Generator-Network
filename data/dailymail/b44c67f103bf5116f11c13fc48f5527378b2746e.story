Two or three lifetimes ago, the satirists Peter Cook and Jonathan Miller performed a sketch which mocked the military mindset.

Cook, as the Squadron Leader, addressed ‘Flying Officer Perkins’, played by Miller: ‘I want you to lay down your life, Perkins. We need a futile gesture at this stage. It’ll raise the whole tone of the war. Get up in a crate, Perkins. Pop over to Bremen. Take a shufti. Don’t come back. Goodbye, Perkins. God, I wish I was going too.’

Miller: ‘Goodbye, Sir —  or is it au revoir?

Cook: ‘No, Perkins. Goodbye.’

Disaster zone: Roy Hodgson took control of a disastrous World Cup

Roy Hodgson is of the vintage which remembers Cook and Miller, and after the past week he will certainly recognise their message. England have just endured a disastrously truncated World Cup so a facile, totally futile gesture is demanded. Hodgson must go! Sack the manager. Why, it’ll appease the rabble and raise the tone.

Now I realise that there are armies of armchair generals who could have done an infinitely better job than the current England manager. True, they may never have been required to pick a team or command the professional respect of a diverse group of young millionaires. No matter, given the time and the facilities, any one of those amateurs could have created a team capable of beating the world. And if they couldn’t, then they know a man who could. But Hodgson failed to land a trophy which England won as recently as 1966, so Hodgson must go.

Yet who should replace him? Who would be guaranteed to do a better job with the players available? Who, in short, would be capable of satisfying England’s absurdly inflated expectations? After all, the alternatives to Hodgson are not queuing around the block. And the field is narrowed still further by the Football Association’s apparent insistence that the manager of England should be English. So who does that leave us with? Steve Bruce? — not really. Alan Pardew? — not a hope. Sam Allardyce — don’t be silly.

But wait! Who is that standing offstage, frantically demanding attention? Why, it’s Harry Redknapp; the renowned sage, raconteur and media darling with a quote for all occasions. Redknapp has made no secret of his conviction that he should have had the England job. You will recall his sneer at Hodgson: ‘Sometimes one face fits and another doesn’t. Simple as that... I think we can all see that he is more of an FA man... he ticks the FA’s boxes as England manager just fine.’ The envy was too blatant, the derision too crude.

Revelations: Harry Redknapp made assertions about unnamed Spurs players who wanted to shirk international duty

He also claimed that several England players, including Steven Gerrard, had sent him texts saying they would love him to manage England. Gerrard denied it, crushingly. ‘I’ve never had his personal number,’ he said. Yet the old chap is not easily discouraged and he was at it again last week, choosing a moment when Hodgson was at his lowest ebb  to impugn the loyalty of England  footballers.

‘I can tell you, when I was at Tottenham when full internationals came around, there were two or three players who did not want to play for England,’ he said. ‘They would come to me 10 days before the game and say, “Gaffer, get me out of that game, I don’t want to play in that game”. I’d say, “You’re playing for your country, you should want to play”. And that is the truth, so it makes you wonder.’ Once again Gerrard, who is the wrong man to upset, came down on him like a ton of bricks. ‘I’d be interested to find out who those players are,’ said the England captain. ‘If Harry is making a comment like that, he should name them and embarrass them... no one has said to me they don’t like playing for England or that they don’t want to be here. They didn’t want to play for England. Who? Name them. We need names.’ 

Straight talking: Steven Gerrard asked for names to be named

Needless to say, Redknapp retreated in unseemly haste: ‘I don’t want to get into naming names because it wouldn’t be fair to the players,’ he babbled. The fact that he had smeared the dozen England players who worked under him at Spurs was apparently irrelevant.

Such is the kind of malevolent nonsense which Hodgson has to endure, and while sympathy is too much to expect, a certain understanding might be in order. For a talented man of substantial achievement is now lazily reduced to a designated whipping boy; a national pin-cushion. Truly, there are times when the futile gesture seems not so much a punishment, more a merciful option.

When the outrage and uproar subsided, all were agreed that the fangs of Luis Suarez had provided the most compelling image of this World Cup so far. And the delicious reactions to his assault only added spice to the story. 

Uruguay opted for blank denial. ‘I didn’t see him bite anyone,’ said President Jose Mujica. The national captain, Diego Lugano, was equally brazen. ‘What incident?’ he asked. ‘I don’t know what incident you’re talking about. Have you got something against Luis?’

They were supported by the philosopher Joey Barton, who twittered: ‘He’s a winner. If that means he occasionally steps over the line between right and wrong, than that’s what comes with the territory.’

Daddy fool: Luis Suarez is back at home with his children after his World Cup disgrace

I suspect our Joseph’s attempts to be taken seriously have not been advanced by that little effort.In the opposing camp, Danny Mills offered a radical remedy. Sounding that note of cool reason, which has made him such an invaluable member of Greg Dyke’s estimable commission, he announced: ‘They have got to throw him in jail and lock him up for ever.’ That’ll teach him.

But the cruellest cut was inflicted by the online betting firm 888poker, for whom Suarez was an ‘official worldwide ambassador’.

First, they declared: ‘We will not tolerate unsporting behaviour.’ Then, following the FIFA ban, the company announced, more in sorrow than in anger: ‘888poker has decided to terminate its relationship with Luis Suarez with immediate effect.’

So it’s official: Suarez has become too tacky, even for a bunch of online gamblers. I fear there can be no way back.

Shame: Wonga sponsor Newcastle

Wonga, the notorious payday lender, has been ordered to pay £2.6million in compensation after sending threatening letters from fictitious law firms to customers in arrears.

Not only were the firms invented but in some cases Wonga actually charged the customers fees for the fraudulent letters. The intention was to pressurise people in arrears by making them believe their debt had been passed on to a law firm, who threatened legal action if the debt was not paid.

Clive Anderson, of the Financial Conduct Authority, said: ‘Wonga’s misconduct was very serious as it had the effect of exacerbating an already difficult situation for customers in arrears.’

Richard 
Lloyd, executive director of the consumer magazine Which?, described it 
as ‘a shocking new low for the payday industry’. Meanwhile, Newcastle’s 
famous black and white stripes are still contaminated by the Wonga name 
as they continue their four-year, £32m sponsorship.

The
 reason for Wonga’s targeting of Newcastle is as obvious as it is 
cynical; the North-East has the highest rate of personal insolvency in 
the country and the area contains a disproportionate number of the poor,
 the vulnerable and the desperate. Chi Onwurah, the local MP, summed it 
up. ‘Some of the richest young men in Newcastle are wearing shirts 
calling on the poorest to go to a legal loan shark,’ she said.

But will this latest evidence produce a change of mind? Will a wealthy club discover a conscience, forego the tarnished money and restore a measure of decent dignity to the grand old shirt? I suspect we know the answer.

The rumours are so strong, they may even be true: Barcelona are attempting to sign Luis Suarez.

Apparently unconcerned by his four-month ban and his appalling reputation, they are preparing to take him to the Nou Camp.

Barcelona represents just about everything that is good in the game, from their insistence on playing the purest form of football, to their treatment of the fans, to their deep respect for their own traditions.

Now they are dallying with a serial biter. We thought they were better than that. Let’s hope we were right.
