The Duchess of Cornwall shows  off her down-to-earth tastes – reading a rip-roaring bestseller and wearing a Marks & Spencer swimming costume on holiday in Majorca – even if she is relaxing on a £50 million yacht.

She was spotted last week aboard the yacht ‘Leander G’, enjoying a Mediterranean break with some friends.

And the Duchess had prepared for her trip with some high street shopping, judging by the royal-blue one-piece she was wearing. The simple costume with white straps, apparently from M&S, is from a previous season and cost about £20.

Casting off: Camilla devours her beach read

It was one of three – including a pink polka-dot and a flowery blue number – that Camilla wore during the day spent sunbathing and swimming with girl pals.

The 246ft yacht is owned by car park tycoon Sir Donald Gosling.

It can be chartered for up to £440,000 a week when Sir Donald  is not entertaining guests such as Joan Collins and Sir Tim Rice. In years gone by, Elizabeth Taylor also visited.

Camilla’s trip to the Balearic Islands was a perfect break for a woman who has long been known as a sun-lover.

And no beach break would be complete without a book to read (a paper book; no Kindles for the Royals!).

Camilla’s choice was the appropriately titled Casting Off, by Elizabeth Jane Howard, who was married to Kingsley Amis and had a much-publicised affair with Laurie Lee.

It is the fourth in the Cazalet Chronicles, a series of novels following the lives of an upper-middle-class English family during and after the Second World War.

The books, which are semi-autobiographical, have been called a ‘guilty pleasure’ but Camilla displayed no signs of guilt, taking regular dips in the sea and chatting happily.

Perhaps her ease was in part because Sir Donald, who was knighted in 1976, has developed a close friendship with the Royal Family and has been discreetly lending them Leander G since the Royal Yacht Britannia was decommissioned. He loaned the vessel to the Queen for her jubilee celebrations and Camilla has stayed aboard at least three times.

She and Prince Charles used it for an official tour of the Caribbean in 2008 and she doesn’t seem to have been deterred by the severe bout of seasickness she suffered then in choppy waters.

This time the sea was calm when Camilla, 66, arrived in the Balearics on Monday for the mini-cruise with her protection officer and some lady pals.

Despite the glorious sunshine, however, a shadow was cast over Camilla’s holiday by the death of another figure from those days.

At home, Prince Charles is mourning his friend Hugh Van Cutsem, whom he met while at  Cambridge University.

The Prince was ‘hit very hard’ by the death of Mr Van Cutsem, who was his confidant during the break-up of his marriage to Princess Diana. Van Cutsem’s house, Anmer Hall, on the Sandringham Estate, was where Charles and Camilla discussed their future together.

The Royal couple will appear in public together on Wednesday when Camilla will join her husband hosting a reception in the gardens of Clarence House to mark 21 years  of Duchy Originals products.Expect Camilla to be sporting  a suntan.
