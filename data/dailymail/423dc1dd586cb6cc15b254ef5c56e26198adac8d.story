A Texas mother who buried her infant son alive has been convicted of capital murder - despite her lawyer's arguments that she is mentally ill.

Narjes Modarresi, 32, was sentenced to life in prison Thursday for the April 2010 murder of two-month-old Masih Golabbakhsh. A jury in Houston, Texas, returned a guilty verdict after deliberating for two hours.

Prosecutor Sunni Mitchell told jurors that Modarresi never formed a bond with little Masih - a baby 'she never wanted and never loved.'

Modarresi, an Iranian immigrant, showed no expression in court as she was found guilty - and again a short time later when District Judge Maria Jackson sentenced her to life in prison.

Her lawyers had argued for the jury to convict her of the lesser charge of felony murder - saying she suffered from depression and bi-polar disorder.

Even the baby's father asked for leniency.

'If she is really sick and everything, which I think she is, she should not spend her life in prison and forever,' Amir Golabbakhsh told KHOU-TV.

Prosecutors argue Modarresi's actions were calculated - not the result of desperation due to mental illness.

'She woke up on April 21, 2010 and decided to kill Masih Golabbakhsh,' Assistant Harris County District Attorney Sunni Mitchell said in her opening statement either this month. 'He was a child she never wanted and never loved. He was in her way.'

The baby was her second child. He died after being buried face down in the mud outside West Houston's Buffalo Bayou.

Attorney George Parnham believes his client's mental state should be a mitigating factor in sentencing even if she is convicted

At first, she claimed two men in a beige Chevrolet kidnapped the boy while she walked him in a stroller.

But according to the Houston Chronicle, a neighbor told prosecutors they say her run and crash the stroller, with no baby in it, into a curb on purpose.

She then allegedly called 911 to report the child missing.

After speaking to her neighbors, authorities finally confronted Modarresi who took them to the baby's grave.

Parnham promised to convince jurors his client was unstable with evidence from psychological evaluations, records of two suicide attempts in her teens, and on psychotic episode on the flight home from her native Iran that forced the plane to perform an emergency landing in Qatar.

Her mental health could be a mitigating factor in sentencing.

If convicted of capital murder she will automatically be sentenced to life in prison. But if convicted of a lesser offense like murder, punishments could range from five years to life in prison.
