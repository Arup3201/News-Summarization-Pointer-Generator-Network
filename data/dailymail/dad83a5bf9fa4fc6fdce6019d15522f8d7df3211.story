Lost: Maddie McCann disappeared in Portugal eight years ago

Police chiefs have been urged to wind up the hunt for Madeleine McCann as detectives battle the terror threat and a spate of murders.

A team of 31 British detectives are working exclusively to find the girl, who vanished from her parents’ holiday apartment in Portugal eight years ago.

The Metropolitan Police was tasked with investigating the disappearance after her family made a personal plea to David Cameron in 2011.

Yet despite costing the taxpayer £10million and dozens of trips by officers to the Algarve, the inquiry – codenamed Operation Grange – has not led to a single arrest.

Now a senior police union leader has called for the probe to be axed and the detectives reassigned to other investigations in the UK.

He says officers in London are bemused why they are working round-the-clock fighting the threat from Islamic State-inspired jihadists and solve at least 14 murders since Christmas while the Operation Grange detectives are barred from helping.

Metropolitan Police Federation chairman John Tully said: ‘It is time to re-focus on what we need to do to keep London safe. We no longer have the resources to conduct specialist inquiries all over the world which have nothing to do with London.

’The Met has long been seen as the last resort for investigations others have struggled with elsewhere.

‘It is surprising to see an inquiry like the McCann investigation ring-fenced. I have heard a few rumblings of discontent about it from lots of sources.

‘When the force is facing a spike in murder investigations it is not surprising there is resentment of significant resources diverted to a case that has no apparent connection with London.’

Even though Madeleine’s parents Kate, 47, and Gerry, 46, live in Rothley, Leicestershire, Scotland Yard was handed the investigation because of its expertise in investigating complex murder case.

Police chiefs ‘ring-fenced’ the inquiry to prevent officers working on other case, even though the force has been forced to make £600million in cuts over four years.

Operation Grange was set up to review the original Portuguese police probe into the disappearance of Madeleine, then three, from the family’s holiday apartment in Praia da Luz on May 3, 2007.

After the Portuguese inquiry was shelved as ‘unsolved’, the McCanns, who remain convinced their daughter is alive, appealed to Mr Cameron for assistance.

Since the girl, who would now be 11, vanished, every possible theory has been explored, including that she was kidnapped by a paedophile, killed during a botched burglary and her body dumped, snatched by traffickers and sold to a childless couple and that she wandered out of the apartment and died in a tragic accident.

However, not one shred of proof of what happened to Madeleine has been uncovered.

Detective Chief Inspector Nicola Wall, who took over Operation Grange in December, and her team ravelled to Portugal to interview seven suspects and four witnesses, but have not released any information about what they discovered.

A Met Police spokesman said: ‘There are 31 officers working on Operation Grange. Their sole investigation is the disappearance of Madeleine McCann.’
