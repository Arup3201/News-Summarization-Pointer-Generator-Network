The boss of the firm which owns British Gas has promised not to take a bonus this year amid mounting public anger at bills soaring by more than 9 per cent.

Centrica chief executive Sam Laidlaw said that while families are ‘under pressure’, pay and perks in the energy industry could not continue unabated.

But last year his total pay, benefits and bonus package was worth almost £5million and he still stands to receive millions in share awards this year.

Pledge: Centrica's Chief Executive Sam Laidlaw told the CBI he will not accept a bonus this year, but will still take home millions

Mr Laidlaw gave no suggestion that he planned to reverse the planned rises this winter, and will still take home a £1million salary.

Four of the Big Six firms have already announced big price rises for this winter.

British Gas will increase electricity charges by 10.4 per cent and gas 8.4 per cent from November 23, hitting 7.8million homes.

Mr Laidlaw, said the energy industry was ‘in the eye of the storm’, conceding that firms should be more transparent, explain how bills are made up and improve the process of switching suppliers.

He was speaking at the CBI annual conference in London on the topic, Business Trust Under the Spotlight.

Mr Laidlaw said he had decided not to take his bonus, because there was a need for leadership at a time of public anger.

'Bonuses are independently set by our remuneration committee but in this environment there is a case for leadership.

‘Just to continue in this world where households are under pressure, and assume it is business as normal, is not the way thoughtful remuneration committees think about it,’ he said.

Mr Laidlaw repeated the industry's pledge to cut bills if the Government switches environment and social costs to other forms of taxation.

Industry sources suggest Chancellor George Osborne could use next month’s autumn statement to cut as much as £75 from bills.

Mr Laidlaw insisted he was focused on helping customers struggling to pay bills this winter.

More than half a million British Gas customers will receive a special discount of £60 this winter, on top of a £135 warm home discount, he said.

Mr Laidlaw said his company had reduced its costs by £300 million over the past few years, and would immediately pass on any reductions in the social and environmental part of energy bills.

‘We are listening - we get it, absolutely. We know there is a problem,’ he said.

Recently announced price hikes will add £50 to every family's bill with some households seeing annual rises of more than £100

Mr Laidlaw said there was no scope for switching profits from one part of the business to another.

Last year Mr Laidlaw was paid a basic salary of £950,000, and received £285,000 in lieu of pension contributions and £71,000 in other benefits.

He received an extra £185,000 under the Annual Incentive Scheme, £855,000 under the Deferred Annual Incentive Scheme and £2.6million in Long Term Incentives.

He could be in line for long term incentives worth £5million this year, which appear to be unaffected by his promise not to take a bonus.

In 2012 Centrica made an operating profit of £2.7billion, up from £2.4billion in 2011.

British Gas is not the only firm hiking bills. ScottishPower bills are going up by 9 per cent, Npower announced a 10.4 per cent price hike, and Scottish & Southern Energy an 8.2 per cent increase.
