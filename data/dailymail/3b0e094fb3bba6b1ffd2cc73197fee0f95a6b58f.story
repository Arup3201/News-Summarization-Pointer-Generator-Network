A 13-year-old boy is in a critical condition after two of his co-workers at a car repair shop inserted a high pressure air pump nozzle in to his body.

Du Chuanwang, from Shandong 
Province on China's east coast, suffered from dozens of puncture wounds 
in his intestines, severe internal bleeding and multiple organ failure.

The horrific assault happened at a car repair shop where the teenager helped out.

Assault: Du suffered appalling injuries after two men pushed a high-pressure air nozzle into his rectum and was in a coma for eight days following a six-hour emergency surgery

Life-saving surgery: Ai Qingze, head of the hospital's intensive care unit said: 'The surgeons immediately cut open his abdomen to let the gas out, and found that his small intestines were bleeding very badly

Two men allegedly inserted the nozzle of an air pump 
into his rectum and filled his body with air.

They have been arrested, said Shi Chuanbin, chief of the publicity department of the local public security bureau.

But claim that they pushed the boy to the ground and pumped his body with a tyre’s worth of air as a 'joke.'

Ai Qingze, head of the hospital's intensive care unit, told ChinaDaily the boy was in a serious condition.

'The pressure inside his abdomen was so high that his legs turned purple.

'The surgeons immediately cut open his abdomen to let the gas out, and found that his small intestines were bleeding very badly.'

Arrest: Two workers have been arrested, said Shi Chuanbin, chief of the publicity department of the local public security bureau. They claimed they were just playing a joke on the boy, said Shi

Du awoke three days ago after being in a coma for over a week and yesterday he was transferred to the intensive care unit at Bayi Children's Hospital in Beijing - staff have not issued any further details about his condition. 

'We can only provide the necessary life 
support to him for now, as his condition is very complicated, and the 
doctors have not yet devised a final treatment plan,' a hospital 
official told CNN.

Du is in stable condition, but his 
intestines, lungs and nose are battling a serious bacterial infection.

His nose and eardrums also suffered serious injury,

Du's mother died six years ago, but his father, uncle and grandfather travelled to Beijing to be at his bedside as he recovers.

Du's family were initially concerned about being able to pay for his extensive treatment, but charity donations have ensured they are able to meet the cost.

A charity group called Angel Mom that
assisted in moving Du to another hospital have also helped in raising 
funds for his care.

China Daily reported that his 
treatment at the first hospital, in Shandong, cost about 100,000 yuan, 
and that the repair shop owner paid for 60 per cent of it.

Du's grandfather said his grandson had worked in the shop because the owner was a family friend.

'Since his mother passed away, his dad hoped the owner of the repair shop could take care of him. We think of the owner as the boy's guardian,' he said told CNN.

According to the grandfather, the repair shop owner did not pay Du a wage, but bought him clothes and other items.
