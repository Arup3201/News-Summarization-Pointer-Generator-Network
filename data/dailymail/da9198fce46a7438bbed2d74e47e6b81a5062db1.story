If you hate rummaging for change when you’re ordering that morning coffee, help is at hand... or thereabouts.

Today sees the UK launch of a range of hi-tech watches that can pay for a double-shot espresso, a newspaper or a host of other small purchases with a flick of the wrist.

They contain a chip similar to a mobile phone’s SIM card that allows you to settle up by tapping the watch on a special terminal at the till.

Hi-tech: The Watch2pay range of gadgets will allow wearers to top up the devices and make payments of up to £15

The ‘watch2pay’ gadgets follow the successful introduction of Quick Tap, a similar system that allows payments using mobile phones, earlier this year.

Available in eight colours, the watches cost £99 and can be used at 70,000 shops in the UK, including chains such as Pret A Manger, Subway, McDonald’s and Oddbins, as well as various independent cafes and newsagents.

Rather than debiting your bank account, they can only spend the money you have topped it up with online – and if the watch is lost or stolen, your account can be cancelled on the phone or over the web.

At first they will only be able to make payments of up to £15, but this limit may be extended depending on their popularity.

MasterCard, which has teamed up with 
watchmaker LAKS for the project, said its devices could help people to 
stick  to a budget, as there is no overdraft  facility, or be used to 
give children their pocket money.

The manufacturers say their watch is more convenient than a Quick Tap smartphone, as it is never tucked away in a pocket or bag.

A spokesman said: ‘We think it will be popular because it takes out the fumble factor – you don’t have to rummage through your pockets to find it.

‘You could use it for your child’s pocket money, or go out for a jog and buy some water without taking your phone out.

‘Some people may feel uneasy about using their phone for everything in case it gets lost, so this offers an alternative, which looks like a normal watch.’

Some experts believe that cash could 
become obsolete within a few years, as so-called ‘tap and go’ technology
becomes more widespread and more people use their phones to make 
purchases, leaving their notes and coins behind.

A survey of major retailers by online 
payments firm PayPal last week even suggested that children born today 
will be the first cashless generation.

Carl Scheible, the managing director of PayPal UK, said: ‘We’ll see a huge change over the next few years in the way we shop and pay for things.

‘By 2016, you’ll be able to leave your wallet at home, and use your mobile as the 21st-century digital wallet.

‘The lines between the online world and high street will soon disappear altogether.’

However, despite this prediction, many of us appear reluctant to part with traditional payment methods.

In July, banks and retailers abandoned plans to abolish the cheque by October 2018 following a public outcry.
