Did you see those photographs of all the black London taxis blocking a bridge over the River Thames as the drivers protested about a phone app for ordering cabs on line robbing them of business?

Notice anything? Not one of them had an England flag flying from its window.

Those red and white standards used to be the first sign of World Cup fever in our country.

Not flying the flag: The Union Flag flies on The Mall but the Cross of St George is nowhere to be seen on the taxis

As soon as you stepped into one of those taxis the driver would ask you what you thought of England's chances. Most of them were bullish about reaching at least the semi-finals. Not at the moment.

In fact, I did not see a single England flag on a black taxi before boarding a flight to Brazil, with the first game against Italy in Manaus barely two days away. Nor an Uber-app or any other mini-cab come to that.

Neither have I chanced upon any in the streets of central London.

As for the shops, not a glimmer of patriotic paraphernalia. And at stores like Marks & Spencer, which used to be brimming with all manner of England and general football memorabilia before and during World Cups past, are devoid of so much as a key ring. Never mind coffee mugs and tea towels.

As I passed through Terminal 5 at Heathrow Airport... not a flag in sight.

Nor a single England shirt. Nor do you see many on the buses, the London Underground or on the pavements. At a guess, replica kit sales are well short of the usual.

It is estimated that fewer England fans are heading for Brazil than for any World Cup since Chile in 1962. The distance and the cost may have something to do with that but the England lads on tour used to save up for four years, dip into their overdrafts and get there somehow.

The crazy, gung-ho optimism of so many of these tournaments was wildly misplaced and perhaps the fans have largely given up hope. But the gloom and doom is uncharacteristic of us as a nation.

Where has all the John Bull-ishness gone?

Roy Hodgson has a young team full of hope. They may not win but I for one give them a 50-50 chance of getting out of the group - at Italy's expense by the way - and reaching their par for the World Cup course: the quarter finals.

A bit of World Cup fervour? A taxi driver waves a replica World Cup during the protest against 'Uber'

The TV companies, desperate to build viewership in return for their World Cup investment, have scoured the land for signs of England fervour. They have filmed some pubs decked out in red and white regalia and the odd street bedecked with bunting.

But they are hard to find, as are invitations to street parties.

Perhaps my low-key London experience reflects more on the capital itself, with its rising proportion of immigrants and its political and social life dominated by a metropolitan elite whose snobbishness would be discomfited by displays of common enthusiasm.

But the taxi drivers? Most of them are good old London boys.

If they have lost the faith, hopefully Wayne Rooney and Co will at least do enough in Brazil to win them back.

Difficult to find: This house in Bristol is decked out in red and white but it is in the minority

A publication* now on the book stands comes as a poignant reminder of when England ruled the game it gave to the world - but also how long it is since that solitary triumph.

Veteran World Cup reporter David Miller has re-published his tome every four years since Bobby Moore led the boys of summer '66 to our only World Cup.

Sadly, although Miller brings the broader World Cup story skillfully up to date, he has not yet had any need to change its title: England's Last Glory.

Foreword thinking: Sir Geoff Hurst (left, celebrating in 1966), writes in David Miller's updated book

'Hopefully I will have to do that before my time is up.' he says.

On this occasion he has to settle for a very good foreword by the only man to have scored a hat-trick in a World Cup Final, our own Sir Geoff Hurst.
