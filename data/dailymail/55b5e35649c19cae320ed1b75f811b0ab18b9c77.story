Jay Wylie will serve more than three years behind bars

A US Navy commander will serve more than three years behind bars after admitting sexual assault and raping two of his female sailors.

A military judge ordered Jay Wylie's dismissal and sentenced him to confinement.

Navy spokeswoman Sheila Murray said Wylie was sentenced to 10 years, but would serve 42 months as part of a plea deal.

During the San Diego, California, hearing, the judge also ordered that Wylie forfeit future benefits.

He was immediately sent to the brig at Miramar Marine Corps Air Station.

His lawyer Jeremiah Sullivan said Wylie was extremely remorseful.

Mr
 Sullivan said the dismissal case would be appealed, but only because 
all dismissal cases automatically go through such a process.

According to the navy, Wylie got drunk on two occasions and sexually assaulted women who were on the destroyer he commanded.

"He wanted to make clear that he's taking full responsibility and accountability for his misconduct," said Mr Sullivan.

"(Wylie) could not have been more remorseful to the victims."

Twenty officers have been relieved of command by the navy this year.

Crimes, of a sexual nature or otherwise, are vigorously investigated and adjudicated as appropriate by the navy, said Ms Murray.

"We hold our people accountable and we expect commanding officers to uphold the highest personal and professional standards," she said.
