A couple who crashed the wedding of a Pennsylvania bride and groom have come forward to apologize for turning up uninvited.

Newlyweds Krista Lamlin and Andrew Reilly had turned to the internet to try to track down the pair, after they were spotted enjoying their wedding reception three months ago.

The hotel hosting the reception escorted the uninvited guests off the premises, but when the newlyweds saw how much the pair featured in their photos they wanted to know who they were.

'We wanted to know if there was malicious intent or if they just wanted to party,' she said.

After hearing about the appeal the wedding crashers, who have not been named, came forward to apologize to the newlyweds.

They said they had been staying at the Valley Forge Casino and Radisson Hotel in January and, when they saw the party, thought it would be fun to join in.

The couple offered to buy the bride and groom a belated wedding gift, but Ms Lamlin refused.

'I didn't ever want to get them in 
trouble. I apologized to them for calling them out, but I
 did want to get the message out there that it wasn't OK to do,' she told ABC News.

She added that if she hadn't spent so much time planning her wedding, the crashers may have gone unnoticed.

'Just be aware of who is on your dance 
floor. Had these people just hung out in the background, I
 probably wouldn't have noticed them,' she said.

On the day of the reception, Ms Lamlin spotted the couple sitting at a table surrounded by her cousins.

‘I knew who I had sat at that table and knew they didn't belong,’ she told ABC6.

What helped the alleged wedding crashers blend in with Ms Lamlin and Mr Reilly's 120 guests was their attire, which consisted of a button-down shirt and tie for the man and a little black dress for the woman. 

The couple made no effort to keep a low profile during the festivities, spending most of the night on the dance floor and waving happily at the camera.

The brazen party-goers even posed for photos, one of which depicts the two grinning and embracing.

The ruse eventually caught up with the sneaky duo, who were escorted out of the venue by the hotel's wedding coordinator.

The newlyweds, who live in Reading, Pennsylvania, appealed to ABC6 Action News to help them find and identify the mystery guests.

Ms Lamlin said she was upset because the unwelcome guests had marred her wedding video and photos, which were supposed to be reserved for their friends and family.
