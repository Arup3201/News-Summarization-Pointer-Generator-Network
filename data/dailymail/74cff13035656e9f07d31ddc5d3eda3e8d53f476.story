David Cameron has issued a humbling apology to the Queen for letting slip her ecstatic reaction to the Scottish referendum result.

The Prime Minister said he was ‘very embarrassed’ and ‘extremely sorry’ to have revealed the Queen’s private views during a conversation he did not know was being picked up by microphones.

His public apology to the monarch is thought to be without precedent for a serving premier. He said he would be following it up with a personal phone call.

David Cameron said he was ‘very embarrassed’ and ‘extremely sorry’ to have revealed the Queen’s views during a conversation with Michael Bloomberg, which he did not know was being picked up by microphones

In the extraordinary sequence, David Cameron could be heard talking to American billionaire Michael Bloomberg about the moment he rang the Queen at Balmoral to give her the news about the Scottish vote

Despite being just feet from the cameras, Mr Cameron revealed his private discussions with the head of state

In the most astonishing remark, Mr Cameron was heard to claim that the Queen 'purred down the line'

The blunder was widely condemned by constitutional experts and one predicted his personal apology to the Queen ‘will be the most awkward call of his career’.

He was caught on camera on Tuesday telling American billionaire Michael Bloomberg that the Queen had ‘purred down the line’ when he called her last week to say Scotland had voted by 55 per cent to 45 to remain part of the UK.

In New York for a UN meeting last night, Mr Cameron said he was mortified to have breached the long-established protocol that content of conversations between the Queen and prime ministers is never discussed.

He said Downing Street officials had already been in touch with Buckingham Palace to offer his apologies, and indicated that he would personally say sorry to Her Majesty when he next has his regular face-to-face audience with her.

But the conversation may have to wait unless he makes it by telephone as they are not due to meet until she returns from Scotland in early October.

Asked if he regretted discussing the Queen’s thoughts and whether he would apologise to her, he replied: ‘Yes and yes.’

During the walkabout, Mr Cameron also vowed to 'sue' polling companies who suggested the Yes campaign was ahead in the referendum campaign, claiming the stress and worry had given him 'stomach ulcers'

Mr Cameron said he regretted discussing the Queen's personal views and said he would personally apologise

In the video recording, David Cameron can clearly be heard discussing his private conversations with the Queen. 

He said: 'The definition of relief is being the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom and ringing the Queen and saying 'It's alright, it's okay'. That was something....

'She purred down the line...

'But it should never have been that close.

'It wasn't in the end, but there was a time in the middle of the campaign when it felt…

'I've said I want to find these polling companies and I want to sue them for my stomach ulcers because of what they put me through.

'It was very nervous moments.'

He added: ‘Look, I’m very embarrassed by this. I’m extremely sorry about it. It was a private conversation, but clearly a private conversation that I shouldn’t have had and won’t have again. My office has already been in touch with the palace to make that clear and I will do so as well.’

A Buckingham Palace source said archly: ‘We are, of course, happy to facilitate any telephone call from the Prime Minister to Her Majesty.’

The apology came as Mr Cameron faced intense criticism over his gaffe.

Dr Andrew Smith, teaching fellow of modern history at University College London said: ‘While it doesn’t seem unnatural for the Queen to have an opinion … it was a particularly sensitive phone call telling her that her kingdom was intact.

‘It does seem like Cameron has been terribly indiscreet, as if he was playing up [to] the bigger boys.’

He added: ‘It was very naive not to think there was a chance of the conversation being picked up … given his choice of language, the [description of her] purring and the fact that there is an important constitutional convention here, I have to say it will be the most awkward phone call of his political career.’

In his apology, Mr Cameron said: 'Look, I’m very embarrassed by this. I’m extremely sorry about it. It was a private conversation, but clearly a private conversation that I shouldn’t have had and won’t have again'

The royal gaffe is not the first time that David Cameron has put his foot in it.

He once let slip that the Queen had teased him about a play in which she is depicted falling asleep at one of their meetings.

The Queen assured him it had never happened in real life before adding – after a pause for comic effect – ‘Yet!’.

Mr Cameron revealed the joke when he met Andy Harries, one of the producers of The Audience, starring Helen Mirren.

Mr Harries told The Mail on Sunday: ‘Mr Cameron told it in a most amusing way.’

In January 2011, the Prime Minister let slip that Prince William had been lobbying against defence cuts. The second-in-line to the throne was angry at plans to close four air-sea rescue bases in a move designed to save millions of pounds.

Last December the judge overseeing the fraud trial of Nigella Lawson and Charles Saatchi’s former personal assistants was forced to tell the jury to ‘ignore’ Mr Cameron after the Prime Minister declared he was a secret fan of the chef.

The Prime Minister admitted in an interview in The Spectator – published midway through the trial – that he was a member of #TeamNigella, used by those rooting for the Domestic Goddess in her very public battle with her former husband.

And in June this year Mr Cameron was rebuked by the judge presiding over the hacking trial after his comments about Andy Coulson nearly led to the collapse of the remainder of the case against his former spin doctor.

Footage emerged on Tuesday showing the Prime Minister laughing and joking with Mr Bloomberg. Although the pair knew they were being filmed, the fact their comments were picked up by microphones appears to have taken them by surprise. 

Mr Cameron can be heard to say: ‘The definition of relief, if you are Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, is ringing up Her Majesty the Queen and saying, “Your Majesty, it is all right, it’s OK.” That was something. That’s relief. She purred down the line.’

By longstanding convention, any discussion between the monarch and their prime minister should remain private, enabling the sovereign to ‘advise, encourage and warn’ with complete confidence.

The fact the Prime Minister revealed details of such a sensitive conversation with the Queen simply to make idle chit chat will likely concern and anger her senior aides.

Leading up to the referendum, Buckingham Palace stressed the Queen’s neutrality and firm belief that the vote was a matter for the people of Scotland.

Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond said Mr Cameron should ‘hang his head in shame’.

The former SNP leader, who led the defeated nationalist campaign, gleefully told BBC Scotland: ‘David Cameron has been prime minister for four years and he hasn’t learned basic civility on not gossiping about what Her Majesty the Queen thinks … That’s absolutely pathetic and he should hang his head in shame.’

Labour MP Paul Flynn described Mr Cameron yesterday as a ‘gossiping motormouth’, adding: ‘I think it’s a major blunder … particularly embarrassing because he was speaking about a sensitive and divisive political issue.’

But Professor Robert Hazell, director of the Constitution Unit at University College London said: ‘[Mr Cameron] had not intended his private remark to Bloomberg to become public. He will be embarrassed … but no lasting damage has been done.’

Andy Zaltzman made the remark on Radio 5 Live

The BBC is under fire after a comedian suggested live on air that there should be a referendum on whether the Queen should be beheaded.

The tasteless remark by comedian Andy Zaltzman, on Radio 5 Live, follows the beheadings of Western hostages by IS extremists.

He was on The Christian O’Connell Manifesto, discussing the independence vote in Scotland, when the guests were asked what else could there be referendums on and Zaltzman suggested a vote on whether the Queen should be beheaded.

Listener Becky Robbins said: ‘It was outrageous. It not only shows a complete lack of respect for the Queen but is also insensitive. The timing could not be worse.’

A BBC spokesman said: ‘We have received four complaints.’
