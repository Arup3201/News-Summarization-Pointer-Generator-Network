Prime Minister Tony Abbott will today announce he has taken his signature paid parental leave (PPL) scheme off the table, as he launches a desperate bid to save his leadership.

Mr Abbott is trying to avoid blame for the disastrous Queensland election result on the weekend, which saw a massive swing to Labor, as the latest opinion poll confirmed his government's standing is plummeting.

A Fairfax/Ipsos poll showed Bill Shorten's Labor government has soared ahead of the Coalition with 40 per cent of the votes, after the Queensland ALP secured a massive swing in an election which saw Premier Campbell Newman lose his seat.

Tony Abbott's leadership deepened overnight when Queensland voters delivered the conservative government a massive blow in the state election

Queensland Premier Campbell Newman and Queensland Labor leader Annastacia Palaszczuk on Friday. The ALP secured a massive swing in an election which saw Premier Campbell Newman lose his seat.

The Coalition dropped in popularity by three per cent, down to 38 per cent.

The polling numbers would see Labor snatch as many as 40 seats in the next election.

This comes as Assistant Treasurer Josh Frydenberg confirmed the government's PPL scheme will be scrapped.

In a major policy speech at the National Press Club on Monday Mr Abbott will announce he is dumping the PPL scheme and will instead introduce a 'families package' focussing on childcare.

'We sought the advice of the Productivity Commission and I have listened to the feedback from my colleagues and from mums and dads around Australia and they have said that, with our current budget constraints, the better focus now is on childcare if we want higher participation and a stronger economy,' Mr Abbott will say, the ABC reported.

The scheme would have paid new mothers their full salary for six months, capped at an annual income of $100,000.

It will be replaced with a revamped families package.

'He's got a tin ear. The captain's pick of Prince Philip was basically a fatal blow to his prime ministership. I think he's got until the end of this week.' - South Australian independent senator Nick Xenophon.

'If they think it's the salesman, not what they're selling, they will have learned nothing. It's the arrogance which really frustrates people.' - Opposition leader Bill Shorten

'It's not just Tony Abbott, it's the Abbott government policies that are the problem. They have to reject the cruel and arrogant way they have been leaning on the poor.' - Greens leader Christine Milne. 

'We would be crazy to repeat the experience of the last Labor government.' - George Brandis.

'We can't continue as we are. We are getting bad feedback.' - Liberal back bencher Jane Prentice looking at the federal impact of the Queensland election wipeout on Saturday night. 

'The prime minister has the support of all members of his government, including me.' - Communications Minister and purported leadership contender Malcolm Turnbull. 

The results come as speculation grows that a leadership adjustment is on the cards, possibly reinstating Communications Minister Malcolm Turnbull to the top role

'There will be an emphasis on child care and how we can build and boost female workforce participation,' Mr Frydenberg said.

It was too difficult to proceed with Mr Abbott's 'signature' parental leave policy given the tight budgetary environment.

'The prime minister recognises that he has to be pragmatic about it,' the assistant treasurer said.

He batted away criticism of the decision, saying Mr Abbott had consulted colleagues extensively and taken into account the Productivity Commission's report into child care.

'You can't criticise him for taking leadership on this issue even though he said at the last election that we're going to introduce the PPL.'

The news comes as speculation is growing that a Liberal leadership spill is on the cards, with suggestions that Communications Minister Malcolm Turnbull could again lead the party.

Foreign Minister Julie Bishop, the deputy Liberal leader, has also been rumoured to be in line for the job.

Backbenchers began talking openly about dumping Mr Abbott as leader after the 'catastrophic' election result in Queensland.

Mr Abbott called an emergency Cabinet meeting on the weekend to restore backbenchers' confidence following the humiliating start to 2015. 

Some of Mr Abbott's closest allies on Sunday conceded party members were unsettled but insisted his leadership was not under imminent threat 

'A few anonymous voices and a couple of people who have been prepared to put their head up do not constitute a basis to unsettle a prime ministership,' Attorney-General George Brandis said.

However, opposition members have called for an end to Mr Abbot's time as Prime Minister, claiming his days are numbered. 

'If they think it's the salesman, not what they're selling, they will have learned nothing. It's the arrogance which really frustrates people,' Opposition leader Bill Shorten said on Sunday. 

'All we are talking about now is the timing and method of execution,' one Queensland MP told ABC News.

'This is catastrophic, unimaginable,' said another. And its not just Mr Abbott that some people have in their sights.  

Media mogul Rupert Murdoch was back on Twitter again berating the government for its poor showing in the Queensland elections.

'Shock turnover in Q'land outing okay government.. Blank check to nobodies. Can't ignore this a huge message for Feds. People have spoken!'

Earlier in the week the media tycoon tweeted that Mr Abbott should sack his chief-of-staff Peta Credlin after his widely scorned decision to award British royal Prince Philip a knighthood on Australia Day. 

The Sunday Telegraph reported that Foreign Minister Julie Bishop has confirmed to the prime minister privately she would not challenge him for the leadership at this point, but refused to deny it may happen in the future.

Following leadership troubles for Tony Abbott, the Prime Minister steered clear of the Queensland campaign amid fears his presence would be a detriment to the campaign.
