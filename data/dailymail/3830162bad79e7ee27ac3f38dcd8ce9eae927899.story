They may have forced Premier League giants Manchester United to an FA Cup replay, but Cambridge United were unable to find a way past Dagenham & Redbridge on Tuesday night.

Cambridge, playing their first game since Friday's 0-0 stalemate with the Red Devils, took the lead when on-loan Norwich City youngster Cameron McGeehan stroked home Ryan Donaldson's corner.

However, the League Two strugglers hit back to earn a point as Andre Boucaud's free-kick was headed in by Ashley Hemmings.

The result leaves Richard Money's men eight points adrift of the play-off places, although they have at least a game in hand on some of their rivals.

Meanwhile, Bury consolidated their spot in the top seven after Nathan Cameron scored a late winner at Accrington Stanley.

Shakers keeper Nick Pope kept Accrington at bay when he denied Piero Mingoia and Sean Maguire after the break.

Nick Adams went close for Bury when he had a shot cleared off the line, but Cameron headed home a Chris Hussey cross to earn the spoils.

The victory gives them a three-point cushion to seventh-placed Stevenage and Exeter City in eighth.

Bury boss David Flitcroft watched his side win 1-0 at Accrington to strengthen their play-off hopes
