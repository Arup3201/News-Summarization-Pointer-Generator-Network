Psoriasis is an immune condition that causes patches of skin on the body to be covered with flaky scales.

It affects two per cent of people in the UK and though not infectious, it can be unsightly. For some, it’s a minor irritation, for others it can seriously impact on their life.

It is a chronic condition and difficult to shift. This week Jini Reddy, 47, visits a clinic for treatment.

WHAT’S THE PROBLEM?

I suffer from mild psoriasis on my elbows, ears and scalp. I’ve had it since I was a child and though I’ve tried countless ointments, the flaky patches have never gone away. Once, when travelling in India, a man came up in the street and said he was sorry for my leprosy! So it makes me feel self-conscious, especially in summer, when I’m baring my arms or when I have my hair pinned up.

WHAT’S THE SOLUTION?

A spell in Jordan at the Dead Sea Spa Medical Center, at the Dead Sea Spa Hotel, 1,300ft below sea level (the lowest point on earth), overlooking – you guessed it – the salts and mineral-rich Dead Sea. People visit from around the world in search of treatment for skin diseases, joint disorders and  anti-stress therapy.  

WHAT’S THE TREATMENT?

The Dead Sea area is rich in anti-inflammatory minerals. The air also has the highest oxygen content on earth and there are extremely low levels of harmful ultra-violet radiation, creating perfect conditions for solar therapy. All of which helps to accelerate the body’s metabolic process and stimulate cell and tissue regeneration.

Clinic director, dermatologist Dr Zuhair Bisharat, says that though the causes of psoriasis are unknown, stress is thought to be a trigger. Treatment depends on long exposure to the sun as well as dips in the Dead Sea. Most patients stay for two weeks between May and November when the sun’s rays are strongest.

I’m only here for three days, but hope to see some improvement.

Dr Bisharat recommends I soak in the Dead Sea three times a day for 15 minutes, sit in the sun for short periods three times a day and drink three litres of water a day. He also prescribes a daily scalp massage – administered by the nurse – with a combination of salicylic acid, caster and olive oils. He prescribes salicylic acid and Vaseline for my ears and elbows, to apply every evening.

I follow his advice and by the end of my stay, the psoriasis on my ears and scalp has disappeared (though it is pretty stubborn on my elbows).

Dr Bisharat says 30 per cent of patients leave completely healed and the rest experience long periods of symptom-free relief.
