Arsene Wenger insists he has no qualms about playing contact rebels Lukasz Fabianski and Bacary Sagna in the FA Cup final.

The Gunners duo are out of contract after Saturday's Wembley clash against Hull City and have both rejected new contracts.

Sagna is Arsenal's No 1 right back, while Fabianski has played in all the club's FA Cup games this season.

And Wenger says he has no fears about playing the pair despite the contractual stand-offs.

'I've got no problems with playing them. I told you many times, for me a professional is to give your best until the last day of your contract.

'That's for me the real professional. I don't doubt their integrity, their desire to win and their commitment at all.'

Arsenal will be looking to win their first trophy for nine years, while Hull are in their first FA Cup final.
