Lawyer Maria Bamieh demanded a corruption inquiry into her colleagues at Eulex rule of law mission in Kosovo

When British lawyer Maria Bamieh was given the chance to help rebuild war-torn Kosovo with an elite EU anti-crime and corruption unit three years ago she jumped at the chance.

Fifteen years after the conflict, Kosovo remains a lawless region, with gangsters, corrupt politicians and war criminals threatening the integrity of the EU borders.

But Bamieh could hardly have known she would soon be demanding a corruption investigation into her own colleagues – or that she would then be escorted out of her office after becoming a whistleblower, and abruptly suspended.

Today, six years after taking the job, the 55-year-old says the investigations unit, known as Eulex, failed to pursue her allegations thoroughly and instead chose to ‘punish’ her for speaking out.

‘I have been subject to a campaign of victimisation and my career with Eulex is over. I may well not work again,’ she told The Mail on Sunday.

‘More to the point this affair raises wider questions about what Eulex has achieved over the six years of its existence and at what cost to the EU and the British taxpayer. 

'Our money is going into this mission and most of the staff work part-time but get a full-time salary. They disappear on Thursday or Friday morning, fly home and reappear on Monday afternoon or Tuesday morning.’

Her worrying story has not only rocked the anti-corruption unit, which has so far swallowed £750million of EU money, but could – if her allegations stick – envelop the EU in a major corruption scandal. 

There is already an official EU investigation into the affair. Ms Bamieh’s concerns reached a head during an investigation into a senior civil servant at the Kosovan health ministry.

The man, Ilir Tolaj, had been arrested and held in prison amid allegations he had demanded bribes from pharmaceutical companies in return for official contracts. He had also smuggled a phone into his cell.

‘I got a court order to intercept his calls because he was not entitled to have that phone,’ says Ms Bamieh. ‘We monitored the calls.’ And the results, gathered in May and June 2012, were disturbing.

It became clear Tolaj was taking calls from people claiming to be intermediaries or go-betweens between Italian judge Francesco Florit, who was seconded to Eulex, and Bamieh’s boss, the Czech chief prosecutor Jaroslava Novotna.

The intermediaries told Tolaj that the Italian judge would ‘do everything to help because he thinks that man [Tolaj] deserves to be helped.’

Bamieh was alarmed to find she was herself the subject of these illegal discussions. It was claimed, for example, that the Italian judge, had described Bamieh as ‘very difficult’ and that Florit had suggested he would get Bamieh replaced.

Another of the middlemen told Tolaj he would hold a meeting with Bamieh’s boss, her ‘chief… the Czech lady’. In one call, Tolaj offers the observation that, ‘I will analyse and see whether I can afford it or not’. The implication was all too clear: two senior colleagues in Eulex could well be compromised, wittingly or otherwise. Florit and Novotna have denied any wrongdoing to The Mail on Sunday.

Ms Bamieh continued: ‘I could not investigate or prosecute Novotna or Florit because I cannot be a prosecutor and witness.’

Eventually, she says, despite the concerns she had raised, she realised there was no proper investigation. 

Her suspicions grew stronger when she was approached by two men convicted of a 2009 bomb attack in the Kosovan capital Pristina amid allegations of a feud between a gangster and a police officer for the hand of a pop singer. It resulted in a fatal explosion.

Ms Bamieh claims she was 'victimised' and 'punished' for speaking out as she was suspended and escorted out of Eulex headquarters last month

The two convicted men, it seemed, had made their own approaches to the Italian judge. She said: ‘They told me they had paid money to Florit... and one of the family made a statement how he went to Albania with his lawyer to do negotiations with Florit and they were told that €300,000 was only enough for one of them to be cleared. 

But when I reported this all that happened was that I got punished. I began to be subject to a series of investigations for trivial offences such as car parking. In reality no one got investigated.’

Eventually she went on Kosovan television to outline her claims.

Kosovo broke away from Yugoslavia in 1999 and became a UN protectorate after its bloody war, which pitched the Serb minority against the majority ethnic Albanians. In 2008 the ethnic Albanian-led parliament declared unilateral independence and the UN unit was replaced by Eulex that same year.

Ms Bamieh claims she asked for protection because of her role as a whistleblower but when Eulux was downsized she was made redundant.

Although reinstated on appeal, she was suspended and escorted out of the Eulex headquarters last month after repeating her allegations.

Eulex accused her of leaking documents to the press, a charge Bamieh denies. Now back in London, the mother of one said: ‘I only went to the press after the story came out to clear my name.’

Eulex has announced a fresh investigation but in a sign of Brussels impatience with the unit the EU’s new foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini has despatched a lawyer to oversee the investigation.

‘For God’s sake, they need to call a lawyer to say how an anti-corruption unit should deal with corruption!’ she said. ‘They are meant to be a rule of law mission.’

Richard Howitt, Labour MEP for East of England, said he had met senior EU officials about the case. ‘These allegations are credible and very serious,’ he said. ‘The EU has to have zero tolerance to corruption. It is clear the existing investigation is inadequate. It appears it could be a cover-up. Maria Bamieh has been let down badly.’
