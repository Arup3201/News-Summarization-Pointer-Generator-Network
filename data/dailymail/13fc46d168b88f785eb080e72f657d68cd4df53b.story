Comedian: Russell Brand cancelled the gigs after promoters said they could not guarantee his safety

Comedian Russell Brand has cancelled several gigs in the Middle East after promoters said they could not guarantee his safety.

The controversial star's Messiah Complex world tour focuses on icons including Che Guevara, Mahatma Gandhi, Malcolm X and Jesus Christ, and examines 'the importance of heroes in this age of atheistic disposability'.

It originally included dates in Abu Dhabi and Lebanon, but they have now been scrapped.

Brand, 38, told BBC Radio 5 Live's Richard Bacon show: ‘The venues contacted us to say we can no longer guarantee your safety.’

He said there was concern about what content could be included in his shows, adding: 'Also the image by the brilliant artist Shepard Fairey does depict me looking a little bit Christ-like, looking off forlorn, thinking, with a necklace with various religious and corporate insignia on them.

'I suppose there's an indication that it might be offensive. Probably if you are in some sort of fundamentalist group in Abu Dhabi and then you Google my name and then watch a few things on YouTube, you'll probably think: "Yeah, just don't bother having him here. Get someone else".

'I think you're safety is never guaranteed at any point. Death awaits. So I was like "Oh please, I really want to go to Abu Dhabi". For me that makes it more of appealing idea (to perform if my safety isn't guaranteed). I said my safety is never guaranteed at any point - I'd still come if you want.'

The tour started on June 12 in Chicago, Illionois, and ends in Reykjavik, Iceland, on December 9.

Revelation: Earlier this week, his ex-wife, Katy Perry, revealed that Brand told her he was divorcing her in a text message. The couple split just 14 months after getting married in India in 2010

The 28-year-old pop star told the U.S. edition of Vogue magazine that Brand was not comfortable with the singer being his equal.

‘Let's just say I haven't heard from him since he texted me saying he was divorcing me December 31 2011,’ she told the magazine.

Perry said the British comedian was ‘hysterical in some ways until he started making jokes about me’ when he did not know that she was in the audience at one of his shows.
