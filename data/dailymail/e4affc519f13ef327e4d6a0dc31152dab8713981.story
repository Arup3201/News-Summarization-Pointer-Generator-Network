Handbag brand, Launer, beloved of Baroness Thatcher for over 40 years, has created a tote bag range, affectionately named 'The Maggie Range'

Britain’s first woman Prime Minister 
may have divided public opinion on many issues but there was no 
doubting the power of her sense of style.

The Iron Lady's 
signature handbag caused such a storm that following the 
announcement of her death that luxury bag firm Launer - the 
brand also favoured by the Queen - saw a 53 per cent rise in sales 
of the black structured handbag that Thatcher loved.

And now, the luxury accessories label and royal warrant holder, beloved of Baroness Thatcher for over 40 years, has created a tote bag range in her honour.

Affectionately named ‘The Maggie Range’, the bag will be sold exclusively at the Conservative Party Conference.

The £5 tote will be on sale until Wednesday October 2nd at a special pop-up shop dedicated to Baroness 
Thatcher entitled ‘Maggie’s Shop’.

The handbag featured on the tote, the Adagio, was one of Baroness Thatcher’s favourite top-handle handbags.

Made
with immaculate craftsmanship, the handbag is still available on the 
luxury brand's website from £1,100 as part of the Classics range. 

'Working
with Launer captures an iconic part of Lady Thatcher's imagery' said 
Scott Seaman-Digby, Commercial Director for the Conservative Party.

Thatcher's handbag became associated both with her personal fashion and her political personality, with her fiery temper and the permanent presence of her rigid black bag causing MPs to coin the phrase 'handbagging'

Thatcher's love of her black handbags spanned her entire political career, from her election to a member of parliament, to well after she had left Downing Street and retired

'It
has allowed us to faithfully recreate an item that as well as being a 
bit of fun is a really great talking point for conference.

'We expect a rush on the tote bags as soon as we open at 9am and have already placed a reorder with suppliers'.

Thatcher’s love of a 
good handbag - frequently a Launer - became inextricably linked to her 
political persona – particularly after her ministers in the 1980s coined
the phrase ‘handbagging’ - a reference 
to both the structured  handbags she always carried and the dressing 
downs she would give her team.

Whilst Baroness 
Thatcher embraced the gesture of a Launer handbag as a gift, she 
insisted on always purchasing them herself, or through her shopper who 
struck up a lasting friendship with Gerald.

The Queen has long been a fan of Launer bags, awarding the company a Royal Warrant in 1981 and is often seen at public events clasping one of their creations

Baroness Thatcher would always send a letter of acknowledgement to Gerald whenever she purchased a Launer handbag.

She would usually make two purchases 
yearly throughout the 80s and 90s, all in a very, simple structured 
style in black or nude tones.

Baroness
Thatcher would always emphasise in her personal letters to Gerald how 
much she wanted to support British business and would often purposefully
carry Launer bags on foreign appointments.

The Conservative Party Conference 2013 is held in Manchester from Sunday September 29th ~ Wednesday October 2nd.

'When
Sam Launer came to England from Czechoslovakia over 60 years ago, he 
brought with him an idea that has remained with the company to this day;
handbags and leather goods should be elegant, be formed out of the best
materials and made by highly skilled craftspeople.'Over
the last twenty five years Launer has built up an enviable reputation 
as a very high quality manufacturer with distinctively good styling, and
currently hold the Royal Warrant to HM The Queen for handbags and small
leather goods.'Launer's 
trademark is understated, elegant and classic - beautiful leather 
articles made with pride by craftsmen and women using traditional 
skills. With care, they give years of pleasure and service.'The Launer factory is in Walsall, near Birmingham, the traditional home of leather goods manufacturing in England.'Launer
wallets, card cases, purses and handbags are handmade in the softest 
calf, exotic lizard, and ostrich skin. Every attention is paid to 
detail, and gold plated fittings feature the Launer rope emblem, the 
perfect finishing touch.'
