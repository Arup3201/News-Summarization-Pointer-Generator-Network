NBC News had a very curious live cross to North Carolina on Saturday night.

Anchor Lester Holt threw to a Weather Channel meteorologist covering the storms in Sugar Mountain.

However Mike Seidel was not at all ready to go on-camera.

A voice on the scene can be heard telling him to turn around, to which Seidel shouts back: 'Why?'

While it's unclear exactly what the reporter was doing, many have conjectured he was relieving himself.

Now what's happening here: NBC News anchor Lester Holt is left shocked when he crossed to weather reporter Mike Seidel on Saturday night, who is clearly not ready for his close up

Hhmm: Seidel fumbles around for a bit and appears to be playing his pants

Close up: The camera goes in on the scene, with this shot leading many to conjecture that Seidel was going to the bathroom in the woods

Getting it together: He eventually turns around and attempts to put his gloves back on

Cut: The studio cuts away from Seidel at this point, quicklymoving on to 'other news'

Not missing a beat, although appearing confused, Holt says: 'Well obviously Mike is not quite ready for us, but lets turn to some other news we're following on this Saturday night.'

Curiously, the camera zooms in on Seidel, even though he has his back to the camera.

Once he turns around, Seidel pulls gloves out from between his legs and puts them on.

A video of the incident quickly went up  on YouTube, with the title: 'Mike Seidel caught peeing in woods live on NBC Nightly News with Lester Holt.'

Seidel, typically a prolific Tweeter, has gone quiet on social media

NBC News are not commented on what happened either. 

Awkward: Mike Seidel is a meteorologist for The Weather Channel for over 20 years and also covers breaking weather for NBC, MSNBC and CNBC.
