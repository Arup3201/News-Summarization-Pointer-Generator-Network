Ramona is name-checked by celebrities as the go-to trainer when they only have a short time to prepare their body and she claims she can transform figures from head-to-toe in just six weeks. 

Over the course of her career, Ramona has whipped hundreds of bodies into shape and has gained a cult following for her 3-2-1 training method, which includes three cardio segments, two circuit strength training and one core segment.

The method, she explains, is designed to add long, lean definition to her female clients and strength and size to her male clients.  

Ramona said: 'Women sometimes shy away from strength training, because they worry it will make them bulk up. However my famous 3-2-1 training method is based on strength training and I always recommend lifting weights to my clients, including Jessica Alba, Halle Berry and most recently Paula Patton, and they still look shapely and feminine.' 

He's got Ramona to thank for that! Ramona has gained a cult following for her 3-2-1 training method, which includes three cardio segments, two circuit strength training and one core segment, which the likes of Zac Efron follow

Workout buddy: Ramona, who works with Zac Efron,  emphasises the importance of training smarter not longer. She says working hard for 30-45 minutes is better than exercising for longer periods (anything over and hour) and risking overtraining

Ramona shared her step-by-guide to achieving a celebrity body in a few simple steps.

It all starts with pre-workout fuel and, she says, if you aren't eating the right foods before you hit the gym, you may be sabotaging your workouts. 

'Eating the right foods at the right times will make a difference in the way you gain muscle tissue,' she says.

'Make sure you have a snack pre-workout such as rolled oats, eggs and toast, or if on the go, a handful of almonds or a protein shake like Everything But the Cow - it is a blend of soya protein and real fruit and will give you the energy you need to work hard. 

'Giving your body what it needs includes restoring a natural balance. Training hard produces stress which in turn, creates free radicals which attack healthy tissue in the body. To help your body fight these free radicals, ensure you have a healthy intake of fruit and vegetables each day such as broccoli, berries and cherries.'

Ramona says there are no excuses for not working out and if you suddenly find yourself away from a gym, then don’t skip a workout just because you don’t have any equipment. 

'Try combinations that include single-legged squats, single-arm pushups, walking squats and sit-ups. A full-body workout can get you the sweat you need in 10 minutes,' she said.

She also emphasises the importance of training smarter not longer. 'If you are one of those people that believes they need to spend as much as ten hours a day in the gym then I have news for you: It is better to train in an efficient effective manner at an intensity level that challenges you, say 30-45 minutes than exercising for longer periods (anything over and hour) and risking overtraining. Overtraining can break down muscle tissue and can even lead to injury over time,' she said.

She also believes that women should lift weights, as daunting as it may be. 'I often see ladies in the gym not lifting enough weight. They are afraid of bulking up, but if not enough weight is lifted then not enough stress is put on the muscle to make a change,' she said.

'Women don’t need to worry about bulking up; hormonally women don’t have enough testosterone to look like men. Halle Berry, Jessica Alba and Kate Beckinsale and all lift weights and none look bulky but instead are enviably toned.' 

And while most of us use the scales to track our progress, Ramona says that number tells only half the story.

'Our body composition reveals ratio of fat to lean muscle tissue and while muscle weighs more than fat, it looks better on a body and it burns calories even while we sleep, so step away from the scales and trust how you feel in your clothes and in yourself.' 

Ramona also emphasises the important of rest and recovery  - a time to rebuild muscle tissue and recharge energy supplies. She advises her clients to  train three days on and one day off. 

It sure works! Ramona's method, she explains, is designed to add long lead definition to her female clients and strength and size to her male clients

Speaking about working with Jessica Alba, Ramona said: 'I can tell you that she’s just like everyone else. Jessica has had to work at it by exercising and eating right.

'What Jess understands is the 80/20 rule. While it’s fun to occasionally go for fancy diners, have dessert and a glass of wine, it’s equally important to prepare most of your meals during the week. 

'Jessica has always enjoyed cooking. She knows that by doing so she can control what goes into her food. She eats plenty of fruits and vegetables and enjoys most dishes. Jessica eats only until she is full then puts the fork down.

'Once you are able to eat in moderation, use portion control and make consistent healthy choices most of the time.'

When it comes to food, Ramona also believes that you should limit your carbohydrates to whole fruit, whole vegetable, whole grain breads, muffins, bagels, rolls, pasta, noodles, crackers, cereal, and brown rice and quinoa.

'Halle Berry has learned to control her diabetes by limiting her carbohydrates to ones that do not cause a rapid rise in sugar levels, this has had the added benefit of weight control',' she said.

'My final word to you is to commit to your goals, begin your plan and stick to it and you can achieve anything including looking hot like my Hollywood celebrities!

'It's within your reach it's all up to you to get the body you have always longed for!'
