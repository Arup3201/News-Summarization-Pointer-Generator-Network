Film-maker Spike Lee and his actress wife Tonya Lewis Lee are selling their historic Manhattan mansion, known as Hatch House, for $32 million.

The sprawling 8,292sq ft home, once a 
former stables, is divided by an internal courtyard with fountain, and 
has had a succession of famous owners, including burlesque dancer Gypsy Rose Lee.

The famous striptease artist hosted wild parties at the Spanish Revival property in New York's Upper East Side, and owned it until her death in 1970.

Details of the interior have not yet been released by brokers Sotheby's International, but the inside is sure to be as grand as its past.

Built in 1916, the three-storey house, with stuccoed walls and a red tile roof, was originally a stables that were bought by the Vanderbilt family as a wedding present for daughter Barbara Rutherford when she married Cyril Hatch.

Its stuccoed walls and red tile roof were part of a redesign by Frederick J Sterner, who chose to makeover the house in an unusual Spanish style, according to the New York Post.

When the couple put the property, originally bought for $85,000, on the market in 1921 it was snapped up by Broadway producer Charles B Dillingham.

The owner of the Globe Theatre and his second wife entertained friends in its grand interior until their divorce in 1924.

Hatch House's next resident was Charles Lanier Lawrance, an aeronautical engineer who worked with the Wright Brothers and invented an engine used by Amelia Earhart.

By the 1940s, the house was home to its most famous owner yet when Gypsy Rose Lee moved in and began hosting lavish parties.

She added a flourish of decadent style to the property, with gold monograms on the doors and frescoes painted on the walls, according to Daytonian in Manhattan.

The 26-room house was said to have had seven bedrooms and a marble floor in the living room.

When Gypsy Rose Lee died of lung cancer at the age of 59 in 1970, the next resident, Dr Ferrucio di Cori painstakingly preserved its interior, and helped succeed in having Hatch House declared a landmark in 1977.

In the 1980s, it became home to Jasper Johns, the artist behind the iconic Flag painting that hangs in the Museum of Modern Art.

He sold the house to Lee, the director of films such as Malcolm X and Crooklyn, for $16.6 million in 1998.
