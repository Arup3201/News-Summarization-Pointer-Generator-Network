From popstars on Twitter, to gamers playing Grand Theft Auto, it seems everyone these days is taking selfie pictures.

While most people use them to capture their everyday lives, one businessman managed to get some more unusual shots this week.

As these pictures show, Bear Silber, 31, managed to snap himself standing next to celebrities after gatecrashing an exclusive Emmy awards party.

From Matt Le Blanc to Rumer Willis - daughter of Bruce - the social networking entrepreneur collared the unsuspecting stars for a quick photo opportunity.

His photos also show him standing next to James Van Der Beek, made famous playing Dawson in Dawson's Creek, and Erin Cummings, who played Sura in Spartacus: War of the Damned.

Bear, who owns sweet chain Powell's Sweet Shoppe, said he was made welcome by the galaxy of stars.

He said: 'I kind of wandered around at first, and actually overall they were fairly friendly and happy to do the selfies.

'Once they had talked to me they loved it and it is the celebrities holding the camera.'

On Sunday Mad Men actor Jon Hamm co-hosted a post-Emmy Losers Party with comedienne Amy Poehler from TV show Parks and Recreation.

The tongue-in-cheek event was held at the Soho House, according to E! Online.

Winners could attend the party, but only if they donated $1,000 to non-profit organisation Worldwide Orphans first.

Actor Jim O'Heir, from US comedy Parks and Recreation on NBC, approved of Bear's new take on the ever-popular selfie.

He said: 'I have to tell you that I think the party that Amy Poehler and Jon Hamm threw was not only a brilliant idea but also the most fun party of the Emmy season.

'It was so funny to see some Emmy statues sitting on a counter. They weren't allowed in the party.

'In addition to that the winners had to make a donatation to World Wide Orphans. It was a 'no-lose' situation.

'Personally, I love the selfie pics. I think they're the most natural and realistic pics. With all of the new ways to share pics people are taking selfies everywhere they go.

'As an actor it gets a little crazy because sometimes I'm out and about and look like hell but people want pics. I don't think I've ever refused.'
