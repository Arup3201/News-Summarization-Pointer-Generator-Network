For those still grappling with the key issues surrounding the Scottish independence debate Taiwanese animators have summed up the debate in just two minutes of footage.

The video, created by TomoNews, shows the leaders of the Yes and No camp fighting it out in the last few weeks of the closely contested campaign.

The light-hearted animation takes the viewer through the changing polls as a sudden swing towards the Yes supporters sparked a last-minute dash across the border by the leaders of Britain's three leading political parties.

Leader of the Better Together campaign, Alistair Darling is seen pressing a giant, red panic button, which is met with Team Westminster plane carrying David Cameron, Nick Clegg and Ed Miliband, flying over Scotland distributing The Vow leaflets - outlining plans to devolve more power north of the border.

A Taiwanese animation, created by TomoNews, has outlined the last few weeks of campaigning ahead of the Scottish referendum, in just two minutes

David Cameron, carrying deputy prime minister Nick Clegg on his front, stands alongside Better Together leader Alistair Darling to encourage voters to back the No campaign

As the polls appear to be in favour of the No camp, a confident animation of Mr Darling, taunts his rival Alex Salmond, before the critical turning of the tables around two weeks before the vote, when the Yes camp took the lead

As Mr Darling's character is knocked off his chair, he frantically reaches for a giant, red panic button

As First Minister Alex Salmond prepares for victory, the animation shows him sawing the nation from the rest of the United Kingdom

But behind him stand the leaders of the country's major financial institutions 

As they move their animated headquarters south of the border, Salmond is stabbed in the back by the last of the business leaders to retreat back to England

Meanwhile in London at Buckingham Palace, the Queen drapes a banner above the balcony, urging voters to 'Keep Calm And Think Very Carefully'

Her majesty is seen crying as she creates a new  flag, missing the blue and white of the Scottish Saltire

Meanwhile 'Team Westminster' fly into Scotland, the leaders of the main three political parties distributing leaflets informing Scots of The Vow - plans to devolve more powers north of the border in the event of a No vote

But dismissing the promises Alex Salmond wraps chips in The Vow, ready to sell to waiting William Wallace, Rab C.Nesbitt and Groundskeeper Willie, all standing in front of a waiting unicorn
