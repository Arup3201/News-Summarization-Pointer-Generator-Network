Pope Francis today issued a blistering critique of the Vatican bureaucracy that serves him while delivering a Christmas message to cardinals, bishops and priests who run the Holy See.

Rather than offering a traditional good-willed festive greeting, the pontiff described how some of those under him lust for power at all costs and lead hypocritical double-lives

He suggested others suffer from 'spiritual Alzheimer's' and forget they're supposed to be joyful men of God - while offering a sobering catalog of the 15 sins of the Curia.

Attack: Pope Francis seen today issued a blistering critique of the Vatican bureaucracy that serves him

The sins, or ailments as he called them, included how the 'terrorism of gossip' can 'kill the reputation of our colleagues and brothers in cold blood.'

Another of the sins was how cliques can 'enslave their members and become a cancer that threatens the harmony of the body' and eventually kill it by 'friendly fire'.

He said: 'The Curia is called on to always improve itself and grow in communion, holiness and knowledge to fulfill its mission.

'But even it, as any human body, can suffer from ailments, dysfunctions, illnesses.'

Non-traditional: Rather than offering a good-willed festive greeting, the pontiff described how some of those under him lust for power at all costs

Francis is the first Latin American pope and never worked in the Italian-dominated Curia before he was elected.

He has not shied from complaining about the gossiping, careerism and bureaucratic power intrigues that afflict the Holy See.

But as his reform agenda has gathered steam, he seemed even more emboldened to highlight what ails the institution.

The cardinals were not amused. The speech was met with tepid applause, and few were smiling as Francis listed one by one the 15 'Ailments of the Curia' that he had drawn up, complete with footnotes and Biblical references.

The annual Christmas greeting comes at a tense time for the Curia, the central administration of the Holy See which governs the 1.2-billion strong Catholic Church. 

Not amused: The cardinals in attendance were said to have met the speech with muted applause

Meticulous: The Pope read a list of sins the Holy See were guilty of - calling it the 15 Ailments Of The Curia

Francis and his nine key cardinal advisers are drawing up plans to revamp the whole bureaucratic structure, merging offices to make them more efficient and responsive.

The Vatican's finances are also in the midst of an overhaul, with Francis' finance czar, Cardinal George Pell, imposing new accounting and budget measures on traditionally independent congregations not used to having their books inspected.

Yet it was perhaps Pell that Francis had in mind when he complained about the temptation to lust for power even if it means defaming or discrediting others 'even in newspapers or magazines, to show themselves as more capable ... in the name of justice and transparency'.

Cardinal Pell recently wrote an explosive essay in Britain's Catholic Herald in which he said his team had discovered that the financial situation of the Holy See was 'much healthier than it seemed because some hundreds of millions of euros were tucked away in particular sectional accounts and did not appear on the balance sheet'.

Getting tough: The sins on the list included how the 'terrorism of gossip' can 'kill the reputation of our colleagues and brothers in cold blood'

All smiles: At the end of the speech, Francis asked the prelates to pray that the 'wounds of the sins that each one of us carries are healed'

The Vatican later clarified that the money hadn't been hidden and that nothing illicit was going on -  just that the funds didn't appear on the Vatican's balance sheet. 

Over the weekend, the Jesuit magazine America reported that an internal Vatican memo had undercut Cardinal Pell's claim of having found the cash in the first place. 

It said the funds kept in the Vatican Secretariat of State were well-known, duly reported, were used to cover Vatican losses and special projects and actually had been well-managed over the years.

Francis started off his list with the 'ailment of feeling immortal, immune or even indispensable'.

Then one-by-one he went on: Being vain. Wanting to accumulate things, having a 'hardened heart', wooing superiors for personal gain. 

Having a 'funereal face' and being too 'rigid, tough and arrogant,' also made into on to the shameful list

Other faults were having a 'funereal face' and being too 'rigid, tough and arrogant,' especially toward underlings - a possible reference to the recently relieved Swiss Guard commander said to have been too tough on his recruits for Francis' tastes.

Some critiques could have been seen as worthy of praise: working too hard and planning too much ahead. 

But even those traits came in for criticism as Francis noted that people who don't take time off to be with family are overly stressed, and those who plan everything to a 'T' don't allow themselves to be surprised by the 'freshness, fantasy and novelty' of the Holy Spirit.

'How good it is for us to have a healthy sense of humor,' he said.

At the end of the speech, Francis asked the prelates to pray that the 'wounds of the sins that each one of us carries are healed' and that the Church and Curia itself are made healthy. 

During today's Christmas speech Pope Francis read out 15 sins that he believed the Curia was guilty of complete with footnotes and Biblical references. These included: 

1) Feeling immortal, immune or indispensable. 'A Curia that doesn't criticize itself, that doesn't update itself, that doesn't seek to improve itself is a sick body.'

2) Working too hard. 'Rest for those who have done their work is necessary, good and should be taken seriously.'

3) Becoming spiritually and mentally hardened. 'It's dangerous to lose that human sensibility that lets you cry with those who are crying, and celebrate those who are joyful.'

4) Planning too much. 'Preparing things well is necessary, but don't fall into the temptation of trying to close or direct the freedom of the Holy Spirit, which is bigger and more generous than any human plan.'

5) Working without coordination, like an orchestra that produces noise. 'When the foot tells the hand, 'I don't need you' or the hand tells the head 'I'm in charge.''

6) Having 'spiritual Alzheimer's.' 'We see it in the people who have forgotten their encounter with the Lord ... in those who depend completely on their here and now, on their passions, whims and manias, in those who build walls around themselves and become enslaved to the idols that they have built with their own hands.'

7) Being rivals or boastful. 'When one's appearance, the color of one's vestments or honorific titles become the primary objective of life.'

8) Suffering from 'existential schizophrenia.' 'It's the sickness of those who live a double life, fruit of hypocrisy that is typical of mediocre and progressive spiritual emptiness that academic degrees cannot fill. It's a sickness that often affects those who, abandoning pastoral service, limit themselves to bureaucratic work, losing contact with reality and concrete people.'

9) Committing the 'terrorism of gossip.' 'It's the sickness of cowardly people who, not having the courage to speak directly, talk behind people's backs.'

10) Glorifying one's bosses. 'It's the sickness of those who court their superiors, hoping for their benevolence. They are victims of careerism and opportunism, they honor people who aren't God.'

11) Being indifferent to others. 'When, out of jealousy or cunning, one finds joy in seeing another fall rather than helping him up and encouraging him.'

12) Having a 'funereal face.' 'In reality, theatrical severity and sterile pessimism are often symptoms of fear and insecurity. The apostle must be polite, serene, enthusiastic and happy and transmit joy wherever he goes.'

13) Wanting more. 'When the apostle tries to fill an existential emptiness in his heart by accumulating material goods, not because he needs them but because he'll feel more secure.'

14) Forming 'closed circles' that seek to be stronger than the whole. 'This sickness always starts with good intentions but as time goes by, it enslaves its members by becoming a cancer that threatens the harmony of the body and causes so much bad — scandals — especially to our younger brothers.'

15) Seeking worldly profit and showing off. 'It's the sickness of those who insatiably try to multiply their powers and to do so are capable of calumny, defamation and discrediting others, even in newspapers and magazines, naturally to show themselves as being more capable than others.
