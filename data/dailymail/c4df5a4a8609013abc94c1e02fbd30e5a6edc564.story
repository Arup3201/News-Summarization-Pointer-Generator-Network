A man accused of throwing his five-year-old daughter off a Florida bridge to her death has been ruled incompetent to stand trial, Pinellas-Pasco Circuit Judge Chris Helinger said on Thursday.

John Jonchuck has been sent to a prison mental facility until he's capable of understanding the first-degree murder charges he's facing. 

He was arrested on January 8 after authorities say he dropped daughter Phoebe Jonchuck more than 60 feet off  the Sunshine Skyway Bridge in St Petersburg, Florida during what appeared to be a psychotic breakdown.

Prosecutors said two experts who've evaluated Jonchuck believe he can become mentally competent with proper treatment in six to nine months. Then, the case against him can continue.

The judge will get an update on his condition during a June 9 hearing.

Jonchuck's court-appointed attorneys have waived his right to a speedy trial.

Jonchuck’s history of mental-health issues was raised as one of several warning signs outlined in a Department of Children and Families (DCF) report released earlier this month, according to Fox Tampa Bay.

The department revealed that it had received several calls from Jonchuck’s divorce lawyer regarding his mental state.

Just 12 hours before he allegedly threw his daughter to her death, his own lawyer called a state child abuse hotline warning that his client was suffering from mental delusions.

But according to documents released by child welfare officials on Monday, the hotline operator failed to pass on the call to investigators because she didn't think the child was in danger.

At the time he dropped the girl more than 60 feet off the bridge, Jonchuck was expressing paranoid fears that Phoebe wasn't his biological daughter

Memorials have been set up in honor of the late Phoebe. Police say John Jonchuck pulled over on the Sunshine Skyway bridge in St Petersburg January 8, pulled Phoebe from the back seat and dropped her to her death

One week earlier, another worried caller told the Department of Children and Families that Jonchuck's daughter Phoebe had been physically abused in the past.

That call, however, also failed to get to DCF investigators because the operator hung up before she got John Jonchuck's address. Instead of calling back, she simply closed the case, according to the state's investigation. 

Police say Phoebe Jonchuck was likely alive when her father sped past a police officer, stopped on the Sunshine Skyway, pulled the girl from the back seat and dropped her to her death. 

Jonchuck's own divorce lawyer had warned authorities of his mental state January 7, telling the hotline operator that Jonchuck had driven to three different churches in his pajamas with Phoebe in tow and asked his attorney to translate a Swedish Bible into English. 

Jonchuck was also expressing paranoid fears that Phoebe was not his biological daughter, his lawyer said.

Phoebe's mother Michelle Kerr is helped away from her daughter's funeral last month. Phoebe Jonchuck was in the custody of her father when he threw his child to her death

'He's calling the office every five minutes and saying these religious things and saying the child might not be his, it just really concerns me,' the unidentified attorney told an operator, later adding, 'It's all craziness and it doesn't make any sense and he's out of his mind.'

But the report noted the relatively inexperienced operator said the caller seemed more worried about Jonchuck's mental state, not the child's safety and labeled the call as 'inadequate supervision' and did not turn it over to investigators.

The attorney even noted that DCF had an open investigation on the family, but the operator said she couldn't find the report and did not ask a supervisor, according to the state's investigation.

The missing report came from a caller who alleged family violence, inadequate supervision and substance misuse at the Jonchuck home.

'We are reminded yet again that every process within our system should be critically examined at every opportunity to ensure that the role it plays is carried out effectively,' Carroll said in the report. 

A call in June of 2013 first brought child investigators to the Jonchuck home where they closed the case, agreeing that family violence threatened Phoebe.

Jonchuck was arrested as a result of the call after an altercation with Phoebe's mother.

He and Phoebe later moved out of the home, but the report released earlier this month noted that no services or interventions were put in place.
