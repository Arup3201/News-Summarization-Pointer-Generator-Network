Britney Spears has opened up about the 90-minute yoga sessions and thrice-weekly cardio workouts that prepared her for her two-year Piece Of Me residency at Planet Hollywood in Las Vegas.

Her comments come after she was accused of faking her toned six-pack with contouring make-up when photos from final dress rehearsals were released last month.

The 32-year-old mother-of-two told Shape that her toned body is actually hard-won, especially those defined stomach muscles.

Hard work: Britney Spears, who was accused of wearing contouring make-up on her stomach during her Vegas shows, has credited her body to 90-minute yoga sessions and thrice-weekly cardio workouts

'I'm doing 90 minutes of yoga twice a 
week in addition to a lot of cardio - hour-long sessions three times a 
week with my trainer, Tony Martinez,' she said.

This is not the first time that Britney has credited yoga with changing her body for the better.

In June last year, her Los Angeles-based yoga teacher Elizabeth I shared some of the poses that have proved especially beneficial for the singer, such as the Bow, the Boat and the Camel.

'Sometimes we focus on the core or relaxation, but other times I just kick her butt!'

'Sometimes we focus on the core or relaxation, but other times I just kick her butt!' she told Shape, explaining that these moves help strengthen the core and sculpt the shoulders.

Britney was first accused of wearing body contouring make-up on her stomach area when images from her final dress rehearsals hit the internet just after Christmas.

And when the singer posted a snap on Instagram from her first show on December 28th, fans were quick to raise the issue in the comments.

'I see the spray tan marks from the abs,' said one, while another commented, 'Ur Abs are so fake! [sic]'

On form: Britney's on-stage dance routines have certainly helped add to her cardio routines. She says that her new choreographers have been working her hard

Another user wrote: 'Oh my gosh. If having a nice body was really that important to you, you should be working out not painting them on!'

Of course her on-stage dance routines have certainly helped add to her cardio routines. She says that her new choreographers have been working her hard.

'This
 year I have new choreographers,' she explained. 'They're fresh and 
upcoming guys so their stuff is really hard. It's more rewarding after 
you perform something that's really hard to do rather than something 
that you just throw together.'

Britney performed over four nights after Christmas and is now taking a month-long break. She will return to the stage for a month of shows beginning at the end of January.

The star will perform 24 of her hits each night and has made sure to include many old favorites for her fans.
