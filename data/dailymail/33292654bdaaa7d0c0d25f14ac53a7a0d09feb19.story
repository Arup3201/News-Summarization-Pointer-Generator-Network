Former BBC Sport's Personality of the Year AP McCoy has spoken of his struggle to start a family with wife Chanelle after taking 'too many hot baths' lowered his sperm count.

The jockey, who has notched up 4,000 wins, revealed 'the dark side' of his private life, just three months after the birth of his second child, Archie.

The 39-year-old also spoke of his wife's personal battle with IVF treatments before conceiving their daughter six years ago.

'Having our children has not been easy. I have never smoked, drunk or taken drugs,' the famous jockey told the Sunday Mirror.

McCoy recalls feeling 'devastated' when doctors told him training had affected his chances of starting a family, saying 'as a jockey you do whatever it takes to keep your weight down.'

The couple embarked on a course of IVF and conceived their daughter, Eve, after the first treatment.

It was more difficult however the second time round, says McCoy, with wife Chanelle undergoing bouts of treatment for months before falling pregnant.

Though doctors were forced to induce the 36-year-old at just 37 weeks, baby Archie was delivered safely three months ago.

'Knowing how hard children are to come by, you realise how precious life is,' added McCoy, who has said he will focus more of his attention on family life in the future.

In a career spanning more than 20 years the Irishman has been hailed as one of the greatest sportsmen of all time, with his victories culminating earlier this month in his Towcester win.
