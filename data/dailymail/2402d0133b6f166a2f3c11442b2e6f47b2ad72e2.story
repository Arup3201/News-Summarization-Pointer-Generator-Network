A Missouri murder suspect awaiting trial for his wife's death is on the loose after escaping custody while watching a fireworks display.

Jason McClurg, 32, was with nine other inmates outside the Shannon County jail Friday night when he broke free.

A woman who answered the phone at the sheriff's office late Saturday afternoon said McClurg had not been taken into custody.

The Winona man was charged in May with first-degree murder for the death of his wife, Stephanie McClurg.

Police
 say McClurg tried to kill his 32-year-old wife by mixing a prescription
 medicine with Kool-Aid, but it didn't work, so he tried again the next 
day and succeeded.

The 
suspect is considered dangerous and possibly armed. He is described as 
6-foot-1, weighing 190lbs with blonde hair, brown eyes and multiple 
tattoos.

Shannon County Sheriff Steven Blunkall told local station KY3 he believes McClurg was headed east.

Officials are now investigating whether McClug was shacked when he escaped during the Fourth of July celebration.Â 

Jason McClurg is scheduled to appear in court August 7 for a preliminary hearing on the murder charge.

According
 to the probable cause statement, McClurg admitted to detectives that he
 made his wife drink the Kool-Aid mix after telling her that their 
2-year-old child had made it for her.

The statement also said McClurg told an unidentified person he had laced the beverage with a large number of pills Saturday because he wanted to 'get rid of' his wife, but it didn't work.

A second person told police McClurg claimed to have thrown a pill capsule by the couch to make it look like she had committed suicide.

Detectives
 in the case said that McClurg used prescription drugs used to treat 
high blood pressure or motion sickness, or a combination of both.

He told detectives that after drinking the mixture, his wife had complained to him of a 'fatigued feeling.'

On the day of Stephanie's death, her husband took to Facebook to thank everyone for their kind words.

'Thank you all for your thoughts and prayers, I'm sorry everyone I just don't know what to say right now, I will always love you Stephanie and you will forever be in my heart.'

Later in an emotional post, Jason uploaded the track, A Thousand Years, which he called their wedding song.

Mrs McClurg, a certified nurse aide, is survived by four children and four stepchildren.
