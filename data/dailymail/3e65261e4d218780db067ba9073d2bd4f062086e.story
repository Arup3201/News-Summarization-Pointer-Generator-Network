Polish planes landing at Heathrow are the loudest the first ever ‘league-table’ of airline noise reveals today.

By contrast, British Airways’ short-haul services are the quietest new data released as part of Heathrow’s new ‘Fly Quiet’ programme shows.

The worst offender is Polish airline LOT, in last place, just ahead of Israeli carrier national El Al in 49th place and Thai Airways in 48th place.

The initiative aims to name and shame airlines into putting a wind-sock in it.

Virgin Atlantic's Little Red domestic service was in second place behind BA, with Irish airline Aer Lingus in third.

Behind it was American Airlines, followed by Qantas, Emirates, American carriers United and Delta, Dutch carrier KLM and Deutsche Lufthansa.

BA's short-haul flights had the lowest levels of noise at Britain's busiest international airport

British Airways’ long-haul flights were outside the top-ten -  in twelfth place just behind TAP Portugal.

Those keeping most people awake at night at the bottom of the table were: Turkish Airlines long-haul, South African Airways, European Air transport, Finnair, and Russia’s Aeroflot short-haul.

The scores were based on noise levels during the period July to September and are given a ‘traffic light’ style rating for various categories and timings of noise.

Of the listed airlines, 80 per cent met Heathrow's minimum requirements on noise, with 94 per cent meeting at least five of the six categories.

Heathrow said a combination of  old, nosier planes, and the way in which it is flown are key factors in noise levels.

A steep descent to the runway also leaves less of a noise ‘footprint’ than a longer steady descent.

Heathrow sustainability director Matt Gorman said: 'We are at the forefront of international efforts to tackle aircraft noise and are committed to continuing to reduce the number of people affected by noise.

‘The launch of the Fly Quiet programme signals our firm commitment to being transparent about aircraft noise and our progress in reducing its impact on local communities whilst still safeguarding the vital connectivity and economic growth that Heathrow provides.’

John Stewart, chairman of the Heathrow anti-noise and extra runway campaign group Hacan, said: ‘We welcome this initiative from Heathrow. It is a constructive move to improve the noise climate.’

BA head of environment Jonathon Counsell said: ‘We are very pleased that our short-haul fleet has proved itself the quietest at Heathrow, and we know we can do more.

'Overall, we have a noise reduction target to reduce the average noise per flight by 15per cent by 2018.’

He added: ‘This autumn we have introduced nine new long-haul aircraft, all of which are significantly quieter than their predecessors, and we will take delivery of more than 30 further aircraft in the next three years.’

The findings come as ‘noise’ remains one 
of the biggest factors affecting whether Heathrow will get a 
controversial  third – or even a fourth – runway.
