Only half of all youngsters have heard of Harry Potter despite the boy wizard being the star of eight hit movies and the best-selling book series in history, according to a new poll.

Fewer still - a quarter of seven to 14-year-olds - had discovered him through reading, says the study suggesting traditional children’s characters are readily forgotten.

Other literary heroes have suffered an even worse fate in their memories as novels drift out of the national consciousness in what researchers say is due to the rise of TV and video game entertainment.

Movie hit: Daniel Radcliffe as Harry Potter in last year's final installment of the movie series based on the seven best-selling books by JK Rowling. Despite its success, however, only half of all children heave heard of the character

Fewer than one in ten had read Anne of Green Gables and Swallows and Amazons, according to the study by Worcester University.

Around one in six of the 500 children questioned said it was not Heidi that lived in the Alps, but Roald Dahl's Matilda.

While around one in eight thought the mountains were home to Tracy Beaker.

And although over half knew that Aslan from the Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe was a lion, nearly one in five suggested he was a giraffe and and the same proportion said he was a bear.

There was also further confusion over CS Lewis's classic novel.

A quarter would have been surprised to find themselves in Narnia, with 17 per cent saying the wardrobe led to the Secret Garden and eight per cent believing it ended up in Willy Wonka's Chocolate Factory.

Three fifths of the youngsters questioned knew that Long John Silver appeared in Treasure Island, but one in ten thought he was from Peter Pan.

The Witch, Wardrobe and a what? A fifth of children questioned thought Aslan, the beast hero of The Chronicles Of Narinia, series was a giraffe

Confusing: One in five also thought Treasure Island pirate Long John Silver (played on stage by Eddie Izzard, right) was in Peter Pan (Jason Isaacs as Captain Hook in the 2003 film, left)

The survey found that classic children's characters like Jemima Puddleduck and Pippi Longstocking meant nothing to three quarters of the nation's children.

It found that just one in four youngsters had heard of these characters, although Robinson Crusoe and Alice in Wonderland were better known (46 per cent and 45 per cent respectively).

Yet it is the lack of knowledge about Harry Potter that is most astonishing.

Enduring appeal: Roald Dahl was voted children's favourite author

The seven books chronicling the adventures of the ‘muggle’ who became a wizard have sold 450million copies since the first novel was published only 15 years ago.

And the last of the eight movies, the second part of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, was only released last year – meaning it should be fresh in youngsters’ memory.

One author whose popularity has endured, however, is Roald Dahl.

He topped the list with a third of votes compared with Harry Potter’s creator JK Rowling with 21 per cent.

A third of the children had read Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, with Wind in the Willows and Winnie-the-Pooh also enduring with 29 and 28 per cent of youngsters reading these books).

Professor Jean Webb, director of the international forum for research in children's literature, at Worcester University said: ‘Thankfully to counteract this possible downturn in children experiencing the classics, there is still a very strong interest in our rich literary heritage.

'This is clearly demonstrated by the popularity of the courses in children's literature currently run across the UK and also internationally.

‘There are many students studying children's literature at undergraduate, Masters and doctoral levels at the University of Worcester.

‘Those students are parents, teachers and would-be teachers who will bring their knowledge and enjoyment to generations of children, engaging them in journeys into worlds of the imagination where they will bring to life past characters and present heroes such as those in Michelle Paver's series Chronicles of Ancient Darkness, Philip Pullman's His Dark Materials and Michael Morpurgo's War Horse.’

The poll was conducted to mark the opening of The Hive, a joint university and public library.
