Rangers keeper Steve Simonsen had to be taken to hospital after a nasty collision with the post at Ibrox on Tuesday.

Ally McCoist's side were hosting Premiership side St Johnstone in the quarter-final of the Scottish League Cup when Simonsen injured himself preventing a goal for the away side.

The 35-year-old was replaced by Lee Robinson after leaving the field early in the second-half before Lewis Macleod’s flashing header four minutes from time sealed the win.

Rangers boss Ally McCoist revealed after the victory that Simonsen required hospital treatment after colliding with the post while saving Brian Graham’s second-half header.

‘I am concerned because he’s off to hospital for a wee check-up,’ he went on. ‘The doc said it’s hopefully more precautionary than anything else but wouldn’t be qualified to give you a comment on it until he’s been looked at in the hospital. Fingers crossed he will be all right.

‘I haven’t seen it but the boys told me that straight away that was pretty clear. You can always tell by the players’ reaction when another player goes down injured, normally the severity of it, and our lads were wanting the doc on and there was a substitution straight away so it was worrying — very worrying.’
