A British schoolboy trapped abroad by a flying phobia is now marooned permanently in the desert by an acute terror of all travel.

Joe Thompson, aged 11, had hoped to return home by land, sea and train, but is now too terrified of ANY transport.

It means his father Tony must now find another job in the Gulf while his desperately worried mother Pauline, remains at home in Weston-Super-Mare, Somerset, and visits him only in the holidays.

The latest setback came at the weekend after they tried leaving Al Ain in the UAE and taking a hire car to Jordan, in the hope of catching a ferry to Haifa, Israel.

But the boy suffered massive panic attacks and hyper ventilated on the driveway of their home.

The symptoms were worse than during his four failed attempts to board an aircraft for the seven-hour flight back to Heathrow, in recent weeks.

One of Joe’s hands became paralysed and he was barely able to breath as he tried getting into the passenger seat for the 1,500 mile journey.

Tony, a former aide to then Deputy PM John Prescott and a superintendent with British Transport Police, has now vowed to end his son’s torment by scrapping talk of getting home overland, while getting him urgent medical attention.

Joe has received his first round of treatment in Dubai for his anxiety which began five moths ago and his 63-year-old father hopes this will help get the terrified child back home.

Joe’s flying phobia has already baffled doctors but they will be even more puzzled by his new terror of any form of transport. He has previously flown all over the world.

'All the disappointment and constant talk of getting him home has clearly upset him, and I don’t want him traumatised further,' said Tony.

'First the Saudis refused travel visas, which meant we couldn’t drive through the country and missed a cargo boat, then they changed their minds and granted the documents before Volkswagen offered to chauffeur drive us all the way home before pulling out at the last minute for security reasons.

'Joe’s in an emotional mess and needs help. Until then, we’ll have to remain here. And I’ll need to find work. It could now be weeks or months before we’re ready to try again to get him home.'

His son's problems began after his father quit his job in Al Ain and needed to return to the UK.

His mother Pauline, who is living at the family’s UK home faces the heartbreak of only seeing them on rare compassionate visits..

Car giant Volkswagen originally offered to chauffeur them back to Britain, but pulled out for insurance reasons, unable to guarantee their safety in strife ridden Egypt.

Tony added: 'With all the discussions, dramas and changes of plans, Joe simply lost it, and won’t get in any form of transport.'

Mum Pauline, 42, who has been married for 20 years, said: 'Joe’s a sensitive boy and we need to try and calm him down, and discover the root cause of his reluctance to return to England.

'Until then we will have to put our personal happiness on hold.'

'Joe has settled in the Gulf with all his friends. I won’t be able to see him or Tony until Christmas and while its going to be tough, I’ve got to put my son’s welfare first.”
