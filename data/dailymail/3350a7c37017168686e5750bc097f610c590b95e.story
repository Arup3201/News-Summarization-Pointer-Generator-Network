Jean Wright, pictured yesterday, is suing St Peter's College, Oxford, for public interest disclosure, unfair dismissal and disability discrimination

The Oxford University college where a bursar claims she was sacked after a conspiracy to oust her had a 'prevalent' culture of racism, prejudice and sexism, a tribunal heard today. 

Jean Wright, 60, claimed she was fired from her role after she pushed for a university archivist colleague to be dismissed over harassment allegations - a move she says turned other staff against her. 

College master Mark Damazer CBE, a former controller of BBC Radio 4, yesterday rubbished the 'spurious' allegation, saying it was 'untrue and without foundation.'

Mrs Wright, from Kidlington, Oxfordshire, is suing St Peter's College for public interest disclosure, unfair dismissal and disability discrimination. 

Today a former employee described a culture of 'unpleasant sexist, racist and bullying staff' working at the college. 

Former bursar Richard Gordon today also spoke out in support of Mrs Wright, saying that there was a campaign against her. 

He added that Geoffery Fouquet, the volunteer archivist whom Mrs Wright pushed to be dismissed, was 'condescending' and 'sexist'.  

St Peter's College's alumni includes actor Hugh Dancy, Governor of the Bank of England Mark Carney, celebrity chef Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall and former FA executive David Davies.

Mr Damazer, who was awarded his CBE for services to broadcasting, took up his role at the college in October 2010.

Early in his time there, Mrs Wright - an employee for 17 years - told Mr Damazer she was angry with how the college handled a complaint she made the previous year about Geoffrey Fouquet.

Mr Fouquet had apologised following an investigation but Mrs Wright made renewed allegations of harassment and bullying in June 2012 and a new probe was launched.

This was dismissed but Mr Damazer decided he wanted to replace Mr Fouquet by Christmas 2012.

Mrs Wright appealed the probe's findings but when this was rejected she took time off from work.

Around the same time there were concerns about an investigation Mrs Wright led into allegations about another member of staff, Roger Hall, which resulted in his dismissal.

This decision was subsequently overturned, after which Mrs Wright met Mr Damazer.

Mr Gordon, 53, said that he was pleased when maintenance engineer Roger Hall was initially sacked after making offensive comments about a colleague.  

The tribunal in Reading, Berkshire, heard that on 8 August, 2012, Mr Hall described a woman called Ruby as a 'lazy cow' and a 'black cow'. 

He was also alleged to have said that Ruby had a 'fat a**e' and that his body was the size of one of her legs.

Mr Gordon said that he was pleased when Mr Hall was sacked because he was 'part of a culture of unpleasant sexist, racist and bullying staff and we had been unable to act against them.

'A culture of racism, prejudice and sexism was prevalent across the support staff in college and when I came across it I was keen to demonstrate that the college would not tolerate it.'

Mr Gordon, who left the college in September 2012, also hit out at fellow Henrietta Leyser, who he accused of running a campaign against Mrs Wright.

This included making two allegations that Mrs Wright had hit colleagues at the college. Investigations found there was no proof of this.

Mr Gordon described Mr Fouquet as 'condescending, sexist, arrogant and rude'.

The former bursar said: 'Geoffrey Fouquet was a loose cannon. Nobody could control him and no one took responsibility for doing so.'

Earlier, former college development manager Kate Longworth told the tribunal there were people at the university who 'had it in for Jean'. 

Ms Longworth said Mr Fouquet was 'deeply unpleasant' to work with and that he spent 80 per cent of the time talking about Mrs Wright. 

But another colleague said that Mrs Wright used to  'scream, shout and swear' at staff and put them in fear of losing their jobs, one former colleague told the tribunal.

Tracey Pullen, head housekeeper at St Peter's College, said Mrs Wright's treatment caused her to have sleepless nights.     

Ms Pullen, employed by the college for 14 years, described how Mrs Wright would 'rule the staff with bullying and intimidation.'  

She said: 'I understand that people have been marched out of the building with no notice and others have resigned as a result of her behaviour.'

'The anxiety and stress of dealing with Jean over the years had built up to such a point that I felt I could not go on anymore.'    

Mr Damazer denied there was any conspiracy to oust Mrs Wright as a result of the Fouquet allegations.

This view was backed up by Professor Lionel Mason, a college fellow appointed to head the appeal hearing into Mrs Wright's dismissal.

Professor Mason, who taught applied mathematics, told the tribunal: 'I considered that there was significant damage done across all of the departments she managed and that staff had expressed great distress because of the claimant's behaviour.' 

'I did not find any link between the Fouquet complaints and the allegations which were made genuinely because staff were upset.' 

The decision to fire Mrs Wright was upheld following an appeal hearing on December 16, 2013.

The tribunal has also heard there were concerns about an investigation Mrs Wright led into allegations about another member of staff, Roger Hall.

Professor Mason said: 'The claimant's negative view of Roger Hall and her intimidation of witnesses in the investigation had inevitably corrupted the process.' 

The case continues.
