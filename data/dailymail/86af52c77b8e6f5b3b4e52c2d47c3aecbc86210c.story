Bridget Anne Kelly wasn't known as an aggressive political animal who would take delight in snarling up the traffic for schoolchildren and emergency services to score petty political points.

She is a mother-of-four after all. One who rose quickly up the political ladder in New Jersey with the words 'pleasant' and 'integrity' attached to her by those who worked and shared the school run with her.

But her reputation is today in tatters after Chris Christie fired his $140,000-a-year loyal deputy chief of staff  for 'lying' and 'betraying' him over the 'Bridgegate' plan to close two lanes of traffic on the George Washington Bridge.

And for her friends, those who know her the best, this just doesn't fit, she was 'no political pit bull'. They are convinced she's the scapegoat, the fall guy, or at the very least has been set up.

'The young lady did not just wake up one morning, when you see the emails, she didn’t just wake up one morning and decide let’s screw up the traffic in Fort Lee,' former colleague and ex-congressman Bill Pascrell Jr told North Jersey.com.

And a childhood friend of Ms Kelly, who asked to remain anonymous, insisted to MailOnline the 41-year-old had been burned after going into politics to help others.

'The noose has been out around her neck to take the fall for this. It's appalling ... They're saying, "We've got them ... See we're punishing somebody and that's the end of it",' the source said.

They added: 'I think as the dust settles the truth will come out. Somebody has moved quick to stamp the fire out and hold somebody ultimately responsible.

'With time the true story will come out . I believe this story is much more multifaceted than just Bridget Kelly. My friend has been scapegoated. She does not have a vindictive bone in her body.'

Friends in the Ramsey, New Jersey 
community, where Ms Kelly lives with her two daughters and two sons, aged 17, 14, 10 and seven, came
 out in support of their neighbor, who is said to have come from a good family of 'high morals and values'. She sends her children to Catholic schools.

In 2005, she wrote a letter to the editor of a local paper about her son, Conor, then 5, who had a heart defect.

According to NorthJersey.com, she wrote: 'I want parents to have hope for children with heart disease... it is not automatically a death sentence, and although it is extremely difficult to maintain a positive attitude during such tribulation, it is imperative for the children that parents remain hopeful and optimistic that we have access to the best medical care in the country.' 

Friends said Kelly, pictured here with Christie in September last year, was 'excited but not starry-eyed' about working for the governor

One 
friend, who asked to remain anonymous, told NJ Patch: 'Bridget is 
wonderful. She's a great mother, a wonderful friend. She's being 
scapegoated.'

And on a Facebook forum supporters closed ranks around Kelly, with one woman, Patty Swanton Synder, saying: 'Bridget is a woman of honor, decorum and integrity. I am appalled that she is being made a scapegoat of all this.'

Outside of her political career, Ms Kelly was involved in her community, where she served on the parent boards of her children's schools.

Her now deleted Twitter account further revealed a dedicated mother who took pleasure in her children's accomplishments and enjoyed family events such as Thanksgiving fun runs.

Although recently separated from her husband, professional golfer Patrick, the couple still lived close together.

Her father Richard Daul, a director of Veteran Services in the county, refused to comment on his daughter's situation, but those close to the family said they had strong values.

And what has shocked friends is the claim that she would endanger public safety by snarling up the traffic on the GWB and delaying emergency vehicles - particularly as her brother is an EMT.

Ms Kelly had risen quickly through the ranks since graduating from Mount St Mary's University with a political science degree in 1994.

Despite her quick climb, co-workers denied she was 'the political pit bull type', further casting doubt on her having a leading role in the bridge scandal.

'I don’t know who the person is that gave the ultimate order,' Mr Pascrell said, adding that he did not believe Ms Kelly would suddenly have decided to set off the chain of events herself.

However, a Republican official in Bergen County who did not want to be named, told Philly.com: 'If someone talked to her funny or didn't give her the right amount of respect, she'd make a phone call and put the kibosh on it', referring to how she would block volunteers jostling for political jobs moving up.

He added: 'It's the banter she would 
usually have used. It's something that she would have said. I'm just 
surprised she'd be stupid enough to write it down.'

Ms
 Kelly had joined Christie's staff in 2010, but her career started as a 
legislative aide - and later chief of staff - for assemblyman David 
Russo. 

Over the next few years she moved up the 
ranks, and was promoted to her well-paid role as deputy chief of staff in
 April last year.

But a close friend said despite being thrilled by the high-flying role she remained down-to-earth.

'Who wouldn't be excited about working for the governor. Who wouldn't 
be. But for her it was an opportunity to give back. She wasn't starry 
eyed about working for the governor. She was excited about having a 
position that she could be a voice of the people.'

The
 source said that the bridge scandal was the ugly side of politics' and 
added: 'It does not become her whatsoever and it's not who she is.'

The promotion moved Ms Kelly into Christie's inner circle, putting her in close contact with officials and lawmakers, including Fort Lee mayor Mark Sokolich, who was the subject of several of the emails.

Her role brought her so close to Christie that she even tweeted a picture of him at her 40th birthday dinner last year.

In
 a message tweeted to @GovChristie and several others in September 2012 
she said: 'Thank you for a great night ... and it's rare that I'm at a 
loss for words'.

As 
questions swirl in Trenton about the two Christie aides who got the axe 
on Wednesday, MailOnline learned that they were connected by more than 
just the jobs they lost.

Ms
 Kelly, Christie's now-former deputy chief of staff, was apprenticed to 
political insider Bill Stepien when they both worked on his 2012 
re-election campaign, and she took orders directly from him, according 
to a long-time New Jersey political operative who spoke to MailOnline in
 Washington DC.

The 
insider, who requested anonymity, told MailOnline that Ms Kelly was the 
tie between Christie's administration and the state's Republican 
political machine.

Mr Stepien's job, the source said, 'was to keep the governor's fingerprints off of things,' and Ms Kelly's 'was to put plans into action'.

The 'plans' that came to light this week were part of a dirty-tricks campaign meant to use a traffic jam to settle an unspecified political score.

He wouldn’t speculate on how much Governor Christie knew about the bridge-traffic plan while it was in motion. But speaking of Ms Kelly, he claimed that 'if she pulled the trigger on all of this, it was on Bill's urging. He really trusted her.'

Mr Stepien did not respond to attempts to contact him about his level of knowledge of the plan, which came to light on Wednesday when Democratic legislators released 22 pages of electronic messages showing Ms Kelly and others orchestrating the operation.
