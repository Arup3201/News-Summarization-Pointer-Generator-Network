Lewis Hamilton is better at making history than studying it. But he could surely see the folly in one famous old telegram sent from the baroque splendour of the Monte Carlo Casino: ‘Cracked the system. Send more money.’ 

Churchill, Onassis, and the future Edward VII all invested on the green baize in this chandeliered masterpiece. But even if a Briton called Norman Leigh waltzed out of the building with £387,000 in one week in 1966 — or £4.6million in today’s money — most gamblers leave with a hole in their pockets.

Beating the system is simply not possible. Nor is it on the newly laid Tarmac of the square outside, with the Cafe de Paris on one corner, or on any part of the wiry streets that stage the Monaco Grand Prix.

‘Monaco is unlike anything else,’ said Hamilton. ‘You know death — not death — but the wall, is just there. That one small turn in too early and you’re gone. Brake a couple of metres too late and you’re in the wall. That’s why it’s the best track. There is no room for error.’

Even a slight brush with one of the barriers can spell the end of a driver’s race, such is the shell-like vulnerability of modern cars and tyres. That is what makes today’s qualifying session and tomorrow’s race unmissable.

Form, says Hamilton, winner of the last four races, should prevail.

It is a track where, despite some of his comments to the contrary, he has previously driven with  conspicuous brilliance, in Formula One and in his soaring journey through the junior ranks.

But he will not be the only high-stakes gambler in the Mercedes team. Nico Rosberg, who trails Hamilton by three points in what has turned into a private duel after only five races of a 19-round season, arguably must risk more again.

Rosberg has been marginally outperformed by Hamilton at decisive moments this year, such as in qualifying, and starting on pole is more significant in Monaco.

Rosberg has shown remarkable fortitude, born of serene confidence, having been runner-up to Hamilton in Malaysia, Bahrain, China and Spain. It was announced on Friday that he has signed a two-year contract extension with Mercedes — a potential lift to his esteem. 

Another important boost could be that he won here last year from pole position, whereas Hamilton has yet to qualify fastest in Monaco during seven years in Formula One.

‘That’s true,’ said Hamilton, when reminded of the fact. ‘Jeez, I haven’t been on pole. I was on pole in Formula 3, and GP2, but, yeah, I didn’t even think of that. Damn.

‘In 2009 I had the chance to be on pole but I crashed. Last year, I wasn’t quick enough. This year, I know I’ve got the car. I don’t have an excuse.’ 

If Hamilton succeeds, it would surely be hard for Rosberg to retain the belief that he can  emulate his father Keke by becoming world champion.

Sir Jackie Stewart, a three-time winner of the Monaco Grand Prix, said: ‘I wouldn’t discount Nico from winning the race. He’s got a really good mind, that boy. He lives in Monte Carlo. He’s come of age as a driver.

‘Getting pole and a good start is crucial. After that, winning in Monte Carlo actually isn’t that hard. The most important thing is not to make mistakes. The new turbo-powered engines make  mistakes more likely. The power doesn’t come in as it does in a  normally aspirated engine; it can come as a bit of a surprise.’ 

The season — as opposed to Hamilton — needs Rosberg to win and stimulate some rivalry. Ennui is already in danger of setting in.

That is why we should welcome Hamilton’s comment that his humble origins in Stevenage make him ‘hungrier’ for success than Rosberg, with his gilded upbringing. Agree or not, it was a rebuke to the sterility of modern Formula One, in which corporate banalities trip off every tongue.
