The world's tallest log cabin which was a remarkable 144ft tall has been destroyed in a blaze.

The crooked building in Arkhangelsk, Russia, was dubbed the 'Eighth Wonder of the World' by the former Russian gangster who built it.

The 13-storey structure began life as a modest two-floor chalet but grew as owner Nikolai Sutyagin became obsessed with topping his neighbours' homes.

It burned down on Saturday when a fire in the five-storey bathhouse in the garden spread to the main building.

Before the blaze, it had stood at around half the height of Big Ben but it was so unstable it moved in the wind.

'Strong winds spread the fire to the wooden skyscraper and completely engulfed it,' said a spokesman for the emergency services.

Entrepreneur Sutyagin
fought with local planners for more than a decade after he began work 
on the project without any official permission in 1992.

The Russian, who believes he has six children, built most of the wooden building himself.

The building stood unfinished after he was jailed for four years in 1998 after being convicted of racketeering charges.

He said that while he was behind bars his equipment was stolen by business rivals and five of his cars were dumped in a river.

'First I added three floors but then the house looked ungainly, like a mushroom.

'So I added another and it still didn't look right so I kept going. What you see today is a happy accident,' he once said.

The
house started to go downhill when Sutyagin was released from jail to 
find his gang had stolen all his money and trashed much of the property.

'When I went to prison I was a millionaire. Now I'm penniless.' said Sutyagin, 65, recently.

He had taken to living in just four rooms at the bottom of the wooden structure with his wife.

The authorities condemned the building as a fire hazard in 2008. All but four storeys were knocked down at the time.
