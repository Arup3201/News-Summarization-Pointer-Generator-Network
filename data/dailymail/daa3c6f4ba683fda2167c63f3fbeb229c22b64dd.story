It's a fiercely clandestine country, but an eye-opening new video offers an insight into the austere and guarded world of North Korea. 

The footage takes the viewer through the eerily quiet tree-lined streets of capital city Pyongyang, past Soviet-style skyscrapers and symmetrical buildings.

The video, shot on a Go-pro camera attached to a car, shows wide roads that are pristine and almost empty of people and traffic.

Though there are smartly dressed traffic wardens, it is less ordered and formal than one might expect.

Communist North Korea has drawn international criticism for the extent of human suffering which occurs at the hands of the DPRK government.

 A UN report earlier this year outlined the stark reality of living conditions there - where every home is fitted with a speaker for propaganda to be blared out, children are taught to draw pictures of Dear Leader and sexual assault by state officials is common.

Only around 6,000 foreign tourists visit each year and there are many restrictions to what they can photograph and film. For example, visitors are prohibited from filming construction sites, undeveloped locations or military personnel.

But tourism could increase in the future as Pyonyang recently announced the country's first surf tour, which followed the opening of a ski resort earlier this year.

However, UN Rights Council reported 'systematic and gross human rights violations' happening on a daily basis, calling into question  the ethics of visiting North Korea.

'I don't think people should simply go to North Korea as tourists,' said Chair of the UK government's committee on North Korea, Lord David Alton.

'Their visit provides the regime with foreign currency and aids and abets a regime which the United Nations Commission of Inquiry report says is responsible for human rights violations without parallel.'
