North Korea today threatened to launch 'precision attack' weapons at U.S. Navy bases if the country is provoked.

The country's supreme military command said it had the bases in Guam and Okinawa in their sights.

The North has responded angrily to 
reports that the United States has flown B-52 bomber sorties over the 
Korean peninsula as part of the annual military drills with South Korean
forces.

A North Korean command spokesman, who
was quoted by KCNA news agency, said: 'The United States is advised not
to forget that our precision target tools have within their range the 
Anderson Air Force base on Guam where the B-52 takes off, as well as the
Japanese mainland where nuclear powered submarines are deployed and the
navy bases on Okinawa.'

North
Korea earlier made a threat to stage a nuclear attack on the United 
States, something that is well outside of its current military capacity,
although the U.S. Pacific bases are in range of its medium range 
missiles.

It comes following reports today that North Korea had issued an air raid warning.

The warning was issued at
0032 GMT and carried a message to military units to stand ready, but 
the action appeared to be a drill under an air raid scenario, Yonhap 
news agency said.

An official at South Korea's Unification Ministry ,
which handles ties with the North and monitors North Korea's news 
broadcasts, confirmed the air raid warning on Thursday morning.

Observations: North Korea has stepped up its military exercises in response to what it regards as 'hostile' joint drills by South Korea and the United States. Here North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un uses binoculars to inspect a live fire drill

North Korea has stepped up its military exercises in response to what
it regards as 'hostile' joint drills by South Korea and the United 
States after Pyongyang was sanctioned by the U.N. Security Council for a
nuclear test in February.

It is not known if North Korea 
possesses drones, although a report on South Korea's Yonhap news agency 
last year said that it had obtained 1970s-era U.S. target drones from 
Syria to develop into attack drones.

"The (drone) planes were 
assigned the flight route and time with the targets in South Korea in 
mind, Kim Jong Un said, adding with great satisfaction that they were 
proved to be able to mount (a) super-precision attack on any enemy 
targets," KCNA reported.

Military: The threat to US bases from North Korean will be a cause for concern in Washington. Here North Korean tank troops take part in military drills

Force: The north's sabre rattling will also lead to increasing anxiety in neighbouring South Korea - which is a close ally of the US

It is extremely rare for KCNA to specify 
the day on which Kim attended a drill.

It also said that a rocket 
defense unit had successfully shot down a target that mimicked an 
"enemy" Tomahawk cruise missile.

The official could not confirm whether 
the warning was part of a drill. The two Koreas remain technically at 
war under a truce that ended their 1950-53 conflict. Tensions have been 
high with the rivals exchanging verbal barbs.

North Korea has said it has abrogated an armistice that ended the 
1950-53 Korean War and threatened a nuclear attack on the United States.

Earlier in the day, KCNA denounced U.S. moves that it said were aimed
at staging a "preemptive nuclear strike" on North Korea, citing the 
deployment of a U.S. B-52 bomber over the Korean peninsula as well as 
what it said were nuclear-armed submarines.

The U.S. and South Korea say their drills are defensive.

Tensions
have mounted on the Korean peninsula since North Korea staged its first
successful long-range rocket launch in December. It followed this up 
with its third nuclear weapons test in February.

Aggressive: North Korea's supreme military command said it had U.S. bases in Guam and Okinawa in their sights. This picture shows a military drill of the Korean People's Army at an undisclosed location in North Korea.

Pyongyang is 
barred from developing missile and nuclear-related technology under U.N.
sanctions imposed after previous nuclear tests.

Earlier 
Wednesday, China's new leader, Xi Jinping, said he would offer to 
promote "reconciliation and cooperation" on the Korean peninsula.

Most
military experts say that the North will likely not launch an all-out 
war against South Korea and its U.S. ally due to its outdated weaponry.

Pyongyang
is viewed as more likely to stage an attack along a disputed sea border
between the two countries as it did in 2010 when it shelled a South 
Korean island, killing four people.

Such a move would provide a 
major test for new South Korean President Park Geun-hye, who took office
pledging closer ties with the North if it abandoned its nuclear push.
