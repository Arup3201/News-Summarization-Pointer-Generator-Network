Neil Redfearn has agreed to become the Leeds new manager, but only on the understanding he can revert to his academy role if it doesn't work out. 

The 49-year-old is ready to try and tame trigger-happy owner Massimo Cellino by accepting a long-term deal at Elland Road.

Redfearn is back in charge of the first-team after Cellino sacked Darko Milanic just 32 days after appointing him.  

Neil Redfearn is expected to take permanent charge of Leeds United in the coming days

Redfearn will want assurances that he can resume his job in the academy if the role does not work out

The axing of the Slovenian was entirely in keeping with his past, with the controversial Italian having seen off 36 managers in 22 years with Italian side Cagliari, 

When Redfearn puts pen to paper, he will become the fourth permanent Leeds boss in the last five months. 

The former Barnsley, Crystal Palace and Watford midfielder is willing to take the plunge, though, leaving behind his work with the club's academy and trying to be the man who takes Leeds back to the Premier League.

Speaking to the Yorkshire Evening Post, Redfearn said: 'I had a meeting with Massimo today. Nothing has been put down in concrete, but I wanted to see how he saw it going forward.

'I don't want this to be a short-term thing, that is no good for anybody.

'He told me that he sees me here for the long haul and that he wanted me here with him and that he does not see this as a short-term thing.

'I get on really well with him and work well with him and understand where he is coming from. He is genuinely trying to do well for the club and I can do with that.'

Leeds owner Massimo Cellino appointed Darko Milanic last month, but sacked him after just 32 days

Milanic was appointed on a two-year deal but did not even last two months... he is now contemplating his future

Redfearn, who made over 1,000 appearances as a player, is best know for captaining Barnsley to the Premier League, but he is a lifelong Leeds fan whose ascent to the top job has been a long time in the making.

In his fourth, and what appears to be final, spell as caretaker between David Hockaday and Milanic he picked up 10 points from 12 and was considered unlucky to miss out on the permanent job ahead of the latter.

Once Redfearn's appointment is formalised then Milanic's brief reign will be completely consigned to the history books, although he says he will be paid until 2016 and as such is available to the club should they want him back.

The 46-year-old is beginning to contemplate rebuilding a career that only five weeks ago was being spent with Austrian side Sturm Graz - a club where he is adored after a successful spell as a player.

Leeds' loss to Wolves at the weekend was the final straw for Cellino, who sacked Milanic afterwards

He says he can do so knowing Leeds are still paying him, though, and was quoted as telling Radio Slovenia: 'I still have a contract on paid leave.

'During this time, I must be ready to take over the team if requested by the owner.'

That technically opens the door for a return to Elland Road before the expiry of his contract in two years' time - something not unheard of in Italy.

Any return looks unlikely, however, with Cellino - who appointed Milanic saying 'he's good looking' - admitting he had made a mistake.

Milanic insists, though, that he does not regret making the move, having bought out his contract with Graz in order to head to England.

'In six games with the team I made a big step forward,' he said.

'It is true that we had bad results, but the day before the game we had praise from all sides on how the situation was improving.

'I do not believe I made a mistake in joining Leeds. I just wish that someone would believe in me.

'Cellino said I'm a loser? He should look at my CV.'

Should Cellino and Redfearn fall out, United's vice-president and Cellino's son, Edoardo, believes he will return to his job at the academy.

Speaking to the Yorkshire Evening Post, he said: 'Even if my father and him fall down he will go back to the academy. But I know he's going to do a great job.'

And according to Edoardo Cellino, the 32 days afforded to Milanic is a long time compared to some who have worked for his dad.

'I remember in Italy my dad sacked seven coaches in one year and one before the season had even started. This is not a record.'
