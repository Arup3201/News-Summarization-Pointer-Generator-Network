Victim: Six-year-old Jersey Bridgeman was found dead in an empty house Tuesday, and authorities are ruling hear death as a homicide

A six-year-old girl, whose father and stepmother were arrested and jailed last year for chaining her to a dresser, was found dead early on Tuesday morning.

Authorities found the body of Jersey Bridgeman, from Arkansas, in a vacant house approximately 10 minutes after she was reported missing.

She had just turned six years old last week.

So far, investigators are ruling her death as a homicide but have yet to say how exactly the girl died or release any names of suspects.

With the investigation already in its second day, officers have conducted searches of three homes, including the girl’s, the building where she was found and a nearby trailer.

Through the process, they have collected about 50 pieces of evidence, which they are currently examining.

Meanwhile, Bridgeman's body has been sent to the state crime lab in Little Rock, Arkansas, and the results of an autopsy are pending.

Police are also patrolling the area and have kept officers watching Bridgeman's home and the home where her body was found.

The FBI has been
brought in to assist in the investigation.

Meanwhile, it is still unclear where Jersey's biological mother, DesaRae, was at the time of the missing persons call.

Bentonville Police Department said that certain details of the case were being withheld 'to maintain the integrity of the investigation'.

After the arrest of her father and stepmother, Jersey was put under the care of her real mother. DesaRae is listed on Facebook as being in a relationship with E-Z Mart attendant Brandon Thomas.

According to police reports, Bridgeman died between midnight and 6:43 am, when police received the call that the girl had gone missing.

Police said the six-year-old had been living with a 'relative' when she went missing.

Stepmother Jana Bridgeman, also identified as Jana Slinkard in court records, is serving a 12-year prison sentence, plus three years for a probation revocation, according to online Department of Correction records.

David Bridgeman is serving an 18-year prison sentence. Prison records show he has a tattoo that says Jersey.

Questions: Police have yet to release a cause of death or a list of suspects and are still attempting to find the whereabouts of Bridgeman's mother and caretaker.

Jersey made headlines last year when her father and stepmother chained her to a dresser as part of a punishment. In conversations with childcare specialists, the six-year-old said that she slept on the floor of her parents' room and that she was tied up for misbehaving.

Behind Bars: Bridgeman's father was sentenced to 18 years in prison for having chain the girl to a dresser as punishment.

'She said that Jana and David chain her to the dresser because she had gotten up and eaten some pies, cereal, and bread,' Rogers Police Detective Larry Taylor wrote in the court affidavit.

He added that the girl 'stated that they put a belt around her waist so that she could not get up and get any food.'

The woman who first contacted the police 
about possible child endangerment said she saw Jersey tied up to the dresser with a 
silver chain, which appeared to be a dog collar.

Bridgeman's father David admitted in court that he did tie up his daughter with a belt but defended his actions by saying that this was to prevent her from getting into medication and other dangerous materials around the house.

'He said that he thinks she may be sleepwalking and that they discussed buying a child gate, but since he does not have a job, they could not afford to buy one at that time,' Taylor wrote in the court affidavit.

The father added that he had first cut a belt to fit around his daughter's ankle and added a lock on it after she had broken free. Then after she complained about the pain in her leg, he chained her by the waist instead.

'It should be noted that the chain that David used was approximately one to two feet in length and appeared to be a dog choke collar,' Taylor added.

Both Bridgeman's father and stepmother pleaded guilty to false imprisonment, permitting abuse of a minor and endangering the welfare of a minor. For their crime, the father is serving an 18-year prison sentence, while the stepmother was sentenced to 12 years.

Shaken: More than 100 people gathered Tuesday to hold a candlelight vigil for Bridgeman.

Remembered: The six-year-old was well loved in her community and many describing her as being special.

The ongoing drama surrounding Bridgeman's death has left her community shaken.

The local school district is currently working on ways to address the death and help students cope with the loss. Administrators said they hope to have finalized plan ready by the time classes resume on Monday.

Meanwhile, Brad Brown, a neighbor, told the local ABC affiliate that he is now concerned about his and his loved ones' safety.

'You
get worried because it's in your backyard, you know,' he said. 'I mean 
this is literally across the fence and across the street in my backyard.
There's people around here that's by themselves a lot, and there's lots
of kids here. Who wouldn't worry about it?'

And on Tuesday, more than 100 people gathered at the Children's Advocacy Center to hold a candlelight vigil in honor of the girl. Members of the event were visible distraught by the girl's death, and to many, she was well-loved.

'There was a unique quality about Jersey," Beverly Engle, the center's executive director, said. 'A little old soul, but such a delight.'
