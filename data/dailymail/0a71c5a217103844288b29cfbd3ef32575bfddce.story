Britons cannot do without their iPads and iPhones after naming Apple as their favourite American export.

A study has found that one in three British people think the electronic giants and their products are the best thing to come from America.

They ranked the devices above the invention of the light bulb, credit card, hamburger and even Elvis.

The research, conducted by St Pancras International Station to celebrate Thanksgiving, saw 36 per cent of people place Apple at the top of the table. 

Britons named Apple, who make the iPhone, as the number one thing they are most grateful to American for. It beat the light bulb into second place

Apple was founded by Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak, and Ronald Wayne on April 1, 1976, to develop and sell personal computers like the iPad pictured above

It was followed by the light bulb with 25 per cent, credit card 22 per cent, and wheeled luggage 22 per cent.

The TV comedy, Friends, starring Jennifer Aniston, Matt LeBlanc, Lisa Kurdrow, Matthew Perry and David Schwimmer, came in fifth.

Also featuring highly were Americano coffee, scented candles, milkshakes and Elvis. 

Across the Atlantic Americans named the 1960s rock and roll band, The Beatles, as their favourite British export.

In a survey 39 per cent of Americans named the UK's best export as The Beatles 

The fab four beat the television, which was created by John Logie Baird

The Fab Four received 39 per cent of the vote followed by the television 34 per cent, the internet 31 per cent and Ian Fleming's fictional character, James Bond, with 30 per cent.

Afternoon tea, the toilet, picnics and whisky also made the American list of UK favourites.

Wendy Spinks, Commercial Director of HS1 International Ltd (owners of St Pancras International) said: 'We twinned with Grand Central Terminal earlier this year as we have lots in common; we both have stunning architecture, eye-catching clocks and reputations as romantic meeting destinations. 

'In the spirit of our American friends and Thanksgiving, we wanted to reflect on what we are most thankful to the U.S. for as a nation. 

'Every day we see lots of people whizzing through the station with wheeled luggage, on their iPads or sipping Americanos on the concourse, and it's great to be able to say thanks to the U.S. for their contribution.'
