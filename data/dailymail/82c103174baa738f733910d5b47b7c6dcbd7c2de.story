Crystal Palace boss Neil Warnock has urged his side to show no fear as they bid to move on from last year's survival miracle and establish themselves as a top-flight force.

The Eagles came from behind to claim their first win of the season at Everton on Sunday and Warnock believes surprise results elsewhere should give his players confidence for the rest of the campaign.

Warnock, whose side face Manchester United's conquerors Leicester City at Selhurst Park next Saturday after their midweek Capital One Cup clash with Newcastle, insisted: 'I think every fixture in this league is there to get points from.

'I know on the day most teams will get beaten by the top three or four in the league but teams like ourselves can play home or away and give a good account of themselves.

'It seems to me that apart from the top four or five we have a wide open Premier League and one we can enjoy being part of. Look at the results [on Sunday]. Anyone is capable of beating anyone else.'

Having been handed the seemingly thankless task of maintaining last season's stunning form under Tony Pulis, Warnock suddenly finds an absence of riches at his disposal up front.

Returning to the starting line-up in place of Wilfred Zaha, Yannick Bolasie produced a man of the match-winning performance at Goodison Park and the Congo winger believes the feel-good factor can lift his team-mates to greater things.

'It's a joy to play in this team,' Bolasie told his club's official website. 'It is a huge lift for us. We haven't lost in three games so we will be looking to carry that on and move forward from here.'
