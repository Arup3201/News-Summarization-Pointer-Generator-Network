An Oklahoma City councillor donated a kidney to someone he barely knew on Monday and credited his strong faith for inspiring him. 

Owasso City Councillor Chris Kelley, 34, and Paul Kropp, 46, had met only a couple of times before but the pair just got a whole lot closer after Kelley gave Kropp his kidney in a life-saving rare organ donation surgery.

'Words can’t describe what he’s done for me,' said Kropp, to Tulsa World.

Blessed: Paul Kropp, 46, was given a life-saving kidney donation from Owasso City Councillor Chris Kelley, 34, whom he'd only met a few times before

Blood brothers: 'He’s given me life,' said Kropp of Kelley as he held back tears from his hospital bed

'He’s given me life,' said Kropp as he held back tears.

Kropp told Tulsa World that he was never the type to get a check-up and remained in relatively good health for most of his life.

All of that changed in February of this year when a friend of Kropp died at age 50 without warning and Kropp decided it would be a good idea to see a doctor to evaluate his own well-being a few months later.

Following the check-up, the doctor gave Kropp some unfortunate news. 

Kropp was in renal failure and was told to report home and go to Hillcrest Medical Center where he was fitted for a catheter for dialysis.

Kropp lost 18 pounds in just one week and the function level of his kidneys dropped from eight per cent to four per cent.

Kropp needed a new functioning kidney and the gift Kelley gave him on Monday is nothing short of a miracle.

Doctors told Kropp to survive that he would need to get a new kidney from a living donor. Most kidney donations come from cadavers but the average wait for receiving one can take up to four years.

Kropp’s wife Missy offered her kidney but she was turned down because she has diabetes.

Miracle: Had Kropp not had undergone a routine check-up he may not even know that his kidney was failing

Out of desperation, Missy took to social media to talk about her husband’s need for a living donor. Kelley saw the post and felt an explainable urge to help a man he’d met only a handful of times before.

‘I’m a spiritual guy,’ Kelley said in an interview last week.

‘I’ve gone to church all my life. But I can’t say I’ve ever had something happen to me where I just felt that I was not making the decision. I read this, and I just felt moved to do something.’

Kelley was tested by the hospital and the kidney was a fit and so he made the decision that would save Kropp’s life.

Kelley’s wife Kathy also urged him to give Kropp the gift he would keep with him for the rest of his life.

‘It’s a sacrifice,’ said Kelley.

‘After feeling what I have felt the last couple of days, I think I agree with that a little more. But really it’s such a privilege because you’re in a position where I’m going to be up and around in two weeks and my life’s going to be back to normal.

New beginnings: Kelley may have lost his liver by giving it to Kropp but what he gained was a lifetime friendship

‘You see what it means to these guys here, and it means the world to me. … It feels great.’

The City Council held a meeting on Tuesday and the members were blown away by Kelley’s great deed.

‘I’m absolutely blown away by what Councillor Kelley has done,’ said Mayor Jeri Moberly

‘I feel honored to know someone who would give this gift that is beyond measure. … Chris’ gift is a shining example of selflessness,’ she added.

‘When you hear about something like this, you tend to ask yourself, “Would I do that?” said Warren Lehr, Owasso’s city manager/

‘For family, for a close friend? Maybe. But for a friend of a friend? I don’t know of many people who would do that.’

Kropp feels blessed for people like Kelley and if he has one word of advice for anyone reading it’s they go to the doctor and get a check-up that just might save their life.
