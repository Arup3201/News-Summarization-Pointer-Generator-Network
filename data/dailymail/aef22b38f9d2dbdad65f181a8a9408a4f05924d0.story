Even by the Islamic State's barbaric standards, the terror group's latest execution video has reached a truly depraved new low.

The footage shows Jordanian pilot Moaz al-Kasasbeh being burnt alive in scenes that are far too shocking to even consider publishing.

As with previous beheading videos featuring British executioner Jihadi John, the 20-minute-long clip is characterised by its slick production values and graphics.

But unlike the others, it contains an added cinematic dimension designed to achieve unparalleled impact on the viewer - as if the horror of watching someone torched to death wasn't enough.

ISIS blames the F-16 fighter pilot  for burning houses - and killing babies - with airstrikes before he was captured in December.

The manner of his death is a symbolic show of strength to strike terror into 'non-believers' and encourage recruits or doubters within their ranks in equal measure.

Horror: The video, which is ISIS' most sickening yet, begins by showing Kasasbeh being paraded in front of heavily armed men wearing combat fatigues and yellow masks

Walking to his death: The professionally shot and edited footage shows Moaz al-Kasasbeh walking towards the cage in which he would be burnt alive

Dr Andreas Krieg, assistant professor for defence studies at King's College London in Qatar, told MailOnline: 'This is a new dimension of brutality, but ISIS had to evolve stylistically from beheadings.

'The global public got more or less used to it. ISIS shows innovation in finding new means of psychological warfare or terrorism.

'Considering the Jordanian public's emotional involvement in this case, this is not just a cruel execution, but an act of terror that is going to hit right into the hearts and minds of the Jordanian people.

'The helplessness of the victim, the viciousness and thought with which the fire was arranged make the video unwatchable.

'It is similar to the first time the world saw beheadings. It is psychological shock and awe delivered through the power of imagery.

'It's like a sickening game show. Everything is so pre-arranged and planned - just the contestant has no chance to escape. It is a new level of terror.' 

The title of the video - Healing the Believers' Chests - is also revealing. It is thought to refer to 'giving them pleasure' - an obvious statement of revenge.

Whereas the Jihadi John videos were often static - showing the executioner standing behind his victims - this video features a slick combination of aerial shots, panoramic views and changing camera angles that would have taken far longer to edit.

Reports coming out from Jordan suggest al-Kaseasbeh may have died as long ago as January 3, suggesting the finished video has been a month in the planning.

The new video also contains far more of the landscape than has previously been shown that intelligence experts will be frantically analysing for clues to the whereabouts of the jihadists.  

The video, which is ISIS' most sickening yet, begins with a lengthy montage showing Jordan's King Abdullah II declaring his support for the anti-ISIS coalition in the style of a TV news report. 

Militants fighting for the Islamic State in Syria and Iraq have released a video they claim shows Jordanian pilot Moaz al-Kasasbeh being burned alive while locked in a cage

Brutal: The footage, which is titled 'Healing the Believers Chests' appears to show the captured airman wearing an orange jumpsuit as a trail of petrol leading up to the cage is seen being set alight

It then cuts to beaten and bruised-looking Kasasbeh sitting in a darkened room wearing an orange jump suit and giving details of his training as a pilot, the anti-ISIS airstrikes he took part in, and details of the crash in which his F-16 jet came down in jihadi-held territory.  

His commentary is preceded and interspersed by slick graphics including one showing an F-16 fight jet being smashed into tiny pieces. 

Another segue features a crying baby over images of infants ISIS claims were injured and killed in airstrikes by Jordan.  

Kasasbeh is then paraded in front of heavily armed men wearing combat fatigues and yellow masks.

The pilot's face looks swollen, heavily bruised and bloody in places - no doubt from repeat beatings by the terrorists from the moment of his capture. 

Al-Kasasbeh is later seen walking towards the cage in which he would be burnt alive.

Whereas the Jihadi John videos were often static - showing the executioner standing behind his victims - the latest video features a slick combination of aerial shots, panoramic views and changing camera angles

It then switches to an aerial shot showing the captured airman wearing an orange jumpsuit as a trail of petrol leading up to the cage is seen being set alight.

The enormous flames quickly engulf the pilot, who is seen battling them for more than a minute before falling to his knees and putting up no further resistance.

He remains alive for at least another 30 seconds, however, before falling backwards on to the floor of the cage. 

The images are far too distressing to publish.

The Sunni Muslim extremist group had threatened to kill Kasasbeh unless Jordan handed over a jailed Iraqi female suicide bomber, but the deal collapsed.

The release of the video of the pilot's purported murder came days after ISIS beheaded a second Japanese hostage within a week.

ISIS had vowed to kill the second Japanese man, Kenji Goto, and Kasasbeh by sunset on January 29 unless Amman handed over Iraqi jihadist and would-be suicide bomber Sajida al-Rishawi, who is on death row in Jordan.
