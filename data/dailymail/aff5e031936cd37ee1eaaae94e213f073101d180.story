MTV reality star Diem Brown is out of hospital and has opened up about the shock hysterectomy she underwent ten days ago.

Ms Brown, 32, collapsed earlier this month while filming a new reality show and was airlifted to a New York City hospital, where doctors diagnosed her with colon cancer after finding multiple tumors in her colon, uterus and stomach lining.

'When I came to, they told me that they couldn't save my uterus,' she tells People. 'That was a blow. Might sound silly to most, but it's what made me still feel like a woman and gave me hope for a future. I felt empty ... gutted.'

She's also had to come to terms with the colostomy bag she's just had fitted. Still, once Ms Brown's medical team told her just how 'touch and go' the surgery had been, she says she gained a better 'perspective.'

'I might not have the ability to ever carry a child and I have this damn bag for the time being – but I'm alive,' she says.

After the emergency hysterectomy, the star - who found fame on MTV's Real World/Road Rules Challenge back in 2006 - underwent a second operation three days later due to an infection in her abdomen.

Speaking to the publication last week when she was still in hospital, Ms Brown's sister said: 'Hopefully in the next few weeks she'll be well enough to start chemo.

'She's on a lot of medication but every once and awhile you'll see her spirit, the light back in her eyes.'

Ms Brown was first diagnosed with ovarian cancer when she was 23; after which she had one ovary, several lymph nodes and part of her fallopian tube removed.

After seven years of being all-clear, the cancer returned in 2012; this time taking her second ovary. Just beforehand, she had her eggs frozen in a desperate attempt to hang onto her dreams of pregnancy and childbirth.

After her second cancer diagnosis, Ms Brown uploaded a powerful video documenting her hair loss after chemotherapy sessions.

Emotionally-charged:  She said of the video, 'I started recording my bi-nightly brushing of my hair ritual in order to show others what really goes on behind closed doors'

She wrote on her People.com blog: 'I was curious about the hair-loss process. I wanted to see how the hair falling out actually happened. Like, how fast did it happen? What does it feel like when it comes out? What does it look like while it's falling out?

'At my two-and-a-half week mark after my carbo/taxol chemo infusion treatment, I started recording my bi-nightly brushing of my hair ritual in order to show others what really goes on behind closed doors.'

Ms Brown, who regularly speaks publicly of her illness, is also the founder of MedGift; a gift registry for sick patients.
