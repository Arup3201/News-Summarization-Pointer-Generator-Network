America's Jordan Spieth cruised to a 10-shot victory at the Hero World Challenge in Florida on Sunday as his compatriot Tiger Woods capped a miserable tournament by finishing last.

Spieth's triumph is his second in as many weeks after he won the Australian Open by six strokes last Sunday and he continued that impressive form in Isleworth to collect his second title of 2014.

The 21-year-old finished on 26-under-par 262 which blew away his nearest rival Henrik Stenson and smashed the tournament record of 266 set by Woods in 2007.

It also broke the record for the best winning margin at the event, which Woods set in the same year when he triumphed by seven shots.

Woods, who was physically ill during his third round on Saturday, was unable to avoid finishing bottom of the 18-man standings as a 72 for even-par 288 saw the former world number one tied last with Hunter Mahan.

Stenson was the closest challenger to Spieth, shooting a 69 for 272 while one shot behind the Swede were Patrick Reed and Keegan Bradley.
