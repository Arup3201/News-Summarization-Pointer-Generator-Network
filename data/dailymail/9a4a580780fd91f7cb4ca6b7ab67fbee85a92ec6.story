Shoppers are being urged to boycott supermarket chicken after a report showed alarming numbers are contaminated with a potentially lethal bug.

Seven out of ten fresh chickens are carrying campylobacter on the skin, according to new study from the Food Standards Agency (FSA).

The bug is responsible for an estimated 280,000 cases of food poisoning each year and as many as 100 deaths.

Asda came out worst in the study. However the food watchdog made it clear that all the supermarkets are putting customers at risk. Consumer groups have condemned the retailers, saying they should ‘hang their heads in shame’ for selling food they know is dangerous.

But Tim Lang, the professor of food policy at City University London, went further and advised families to boycott chicken until the industry can guarantee the meat is safe.

He compared the public health crisis to mad cow disease and salmonella, saying: ‘I would suggest that we refuse to buy poultry until this is sorted out. This is a public health scandal easily on a par to that of the 1980s-90s.’

The number of fresh shop-bought chickens contaminated with the lethal campylobacter food poisoning bug has risen to 70 per cent

Professor Lang went on to suggest that the public should withhold its money until confidence in the safety of chicken is restored.

‘This may not be part of the public health methods but it’s definitely what history shows works when things are dire,’ he said.

The FSA found that 70 per cent of chickens on sale over the six months between February and the end of July were contaminated – worse than the 65 per cent reported in a similar study in 2009.

During the May to July period, the figure was eight in ten birds, and could have been as much as nine in ten for some retailers.

Almost one in five – 18 per cent – of the fresh roasting chickens were contaminated with the highest levels of the bug.

More than one in 20, or 6 per cent, carried the bug on the outside of packs, meaning that people simply picking them from the shelf to check a price could fall ill.

The study also revealed that Asda was the worst performer, with a contamination rate of 78 per cent. More than one in ten of its packs – 12 per cent – carried the potentially lethal bug on the outside.

The second highest contamination rate was for a group of smaller retailers including independent butchers and budget chains like Lidl, Aldi, Iceland and Budgens with a contamination rate of 76 per cent. The Co-op came next followed by Morrisons, Sainsbury’s, Waitrose, Marks & Spencer and Tesco.

Producers have struggled to identify how the bug is introduced to flocks. While it is found in the  countryside, most of the 800million chickens raised for food in the UK each year spend their entire lives inside

Which? executive director Richard Lloyd said: ‘These results are a damning indictment of supermarkets and consumers will be rightly shocked at the failure of trusted household brands to stem the tide of increasingly high levels of campylobacter. Supermarket bosses should hang their heads in shame.’

Earlier this year, retailers mounted a fierce lobbying campaign against the FSA survey. Specifically, they wanted to block the naming and shaming of stores because of the risk to sales and profits. Initially, they were successful after winning over ministers and officials in the Department of Health, DEFRA and even the Prime Minister’s office.

Asda had the highest percentage of contaminated fresh chickens at 78 per cent

However the FSA decided to publicly shame the stores following pressure from consumer groups, academics and the public. Critics have argued that the FSA and the Government have failed to ensure supermarkets sell safe food – with the commercial interests of stores, processors and farmers given greater priority than consumers’ health.

Significantly, the FSA has no powers to force supermarkets to take so-called ‘dirty chickens’ off their shelves or to impose any sort of sanction or fine to ensure they make improvements. It is hoping that the industry abides by a promise to reduce the number of the highly contaminated birds to 10 per cent by the end of 2015.

The illness associated with the bug has enormous economic costs in terms of lost days at work and NHS treatment. Some estimates put this bill at £900million a year.

An Asda spokesman said: ‘We take campylobacter seriously and it goes without saying that we’re disappointed with these findings.’ The British Retail Consortium, which represents the supermarkets, claimed the industry is doing its best to tackle the bug.

Campylobacter is killed by thorough cooking and can be limited by careful hygiene but it is the most common form of food poisoning in the UK, affecting an estimated 280,000 people a year. 

Symptoms usually develop two to five days after eating contaminated food. Most people recover after a few days but in some cases, campylobacter infection can cause irritable bowel syndrome, reactive arthritis or miscarriage.

It can be fatal in young children, the elderly and people with a weakened immune system, including cancer patients.

Around 100 of the victims die from vomiting and stomach upsets.

Poultry is the source of the majority of these cases.  

Research by the Institute of Food Research showed that the persistence of campylobacter - a group of bacteria that commonly cause food poisoning - is boosted by 'chicken juice'.

Organic matter exuding from chicken carcasses provides the bacteria with the perfect environment to flourish in the food chain.

The findings, the researchers said, highlight the importance of cleaning surfaces during food preparation. 

But Professor Brendan Wren, from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said: ‘Frankly it is scandalous that two out of three chickens bought into our households are contaminated with such a serious pathogen, I can’t think of any other situation where this would be allowed. Our poultry flocks need to be vaccinated against campylobacter, even if this slightly increases the cost of poultry products.’

Families are being warned that their Christmas turkeys could also be infected by campylobacter.FSA policy director Steve Wearne said: ‘What we know about campylobacter is that all poultry are susceptible to some degree. But levels in turkey and turkey meat are generally lower than in chicken.’
