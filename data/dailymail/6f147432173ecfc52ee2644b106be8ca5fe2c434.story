The true cost of trying to lure Cristiano Ronaldo back to the Premier League can be revealed to be more than £140million after it emerged that the former Manchester United star’s advisors have been asking for astonishing wages of £20m a year.

Ronaldo is understood to be willing to listen to offers after becoming unsettled at Real Madrid and new United manager Louis van Gaal did not rule out a move for the World Player of the Year last weekend.

However, any club wishing to buy Ronaldo would have to come up with mind-boggling sums after it emerged that the player’s representatives set the bar at £385,000 a week when they put feelers out regarding their client 18 months ago. 

At that time United were interested in a move for their former golden child as the club’s owners the Glazer family looked to add the ultimate signing to the squad David Moyes had inherited from Sir Alex Ferguson.

Ronaldo was hawked around Europe’s top clubs that summer before eventually signing a new five-year deal at the Bernabeu.

‘It simply wasn’t worth having the conversation at those numbers,’ said one top Premier League source on Thursday night.

Despite Ronaldo’s success at Real — he now has 264 goals for them — he is expected to look to leave once again next summer.

Sources in Spain point to Ronaldo not feeling loved and indicate he may be president Florentino Perez’s one high-profile departure of 2015.

By then Ronaldo will be past his 30th birthday and there are serious questions as to whether United — or anyone in England — could find the money to sign him, even if his wage demands were to drop slightly. 

With Perez sure to want around £60m for someone who continues to produce world-class displays, even a four-year deal for Ronaldo would take the total investment to over £140m — for a player heading towards his 35th birthday by the time that contract ran out.

Last month United did decide to go the extra mile to sign another Real Madrid player, Angel di Maria, in a transfer worth more than £120m.

They also agreed to pay loanee striker Falcao £265,000 a week between now and the end of the season. 

However, a move for Ronaldo would blow those salaries out of the water and cause potential problems. 

Another Premier League executive said: ‘Even when you have a dressing room full of well-paid players, you are always taking a risk when you introduce a player who earns so much more than the rest.’
