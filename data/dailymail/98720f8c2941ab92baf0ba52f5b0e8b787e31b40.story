A two-year-old twin girl has been crushed to death by a door as her family moved into their new home, police have said.

Iva Potter's family had taken a door leading from the garage into the laundry room off its hinges so they could easily move items into the house in Lewisville, Texas on Thursday afternoon.

The heavy door was leaning against a wall but somehow crushed Iva and she was found face-down on the ground, Lewisville Captain Dan Rochelle told NBCDFW.

Police said they are not sure if the door fell as the little girl pulled on it or if it was blown down by a gust of wind.

Tragic: Iva Potter, pictured, was crushed to death by a door that had been taken off its hinges as her family moved into a new home on Thursday. It is not clear if she pulled the door or if it was blown over

Loss: Iva, who had a twin sister, was just weeks away from her third birthday when she was killed

'Honestly, I don't think we'll ever know the answer to that,' he said. 'There are some different theories that she may have pulled the door on her.

'There is also a wind-tunnel effect from the garage going into the house, and maybe that wind caught the door and knocked it over on her.'

The girl's family called 911 and police were first to arrive on the scene. A responding officer performed CPR until paramedics arrived and she was rushed to hospital.

But little Iva, who had a twin sister and was just weeks from her third birthday, was pronounced dead just before 2pm.

Lewisville police are continuing to investigate but say they believe it was a tragic accident and there is no indication of foul play.

Scene: Her family had been moving into this Lewisville, Texas home when the tragedy unfolded on Thursday

On Thursday afternoon, a teenager who said she was Iva's big sister shared photos of the little girl.   

'RIP to my angel,' she wrote. 'Being your big sister has been the best thing that's ever happened to me. I love you so much Iva Lea.'

The girl's parents have not been identified.
