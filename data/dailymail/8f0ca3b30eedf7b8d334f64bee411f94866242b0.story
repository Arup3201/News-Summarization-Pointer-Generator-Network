A man had his passport confiscated after he landed at an airport because a passport control official allegedly didn't like the look of his moustache.

Sujeev Kumar had flown to Sharjah airport in the United Arab Emirates from Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala, in India.

He claims as he went through the checks, the officer stamped his passport but didn't return it.

The official then asked him how he kept his moustache brushed.

The software engineer laughed the comment off but says the officer told him he would return the passport if he shaved off his moustache.

Mr Kumar assumed this was a joke but when the immigration officer continued asking him questions about his moustache and kept making comments to other passengers and colleagues.

He told the website: 'He finally told me: "If you agree to shave off your moustache, I will let you to go" and kept my passport with him,' said Kumar.

'He kept my passport and told me very seriously again to remove my moustache if I wanted it back and called the next person in line.'

Mr Kumar, who has lived in the United Arab Emirates for nine years, says he was confused as the official was speaking in Urdu and he does not speak the language.

He claims it was only when he asked to speak to a senior officer that the man gave him his passport back and has complained against the 'unnecessary harassment'.

Officials at the Sharjah Department of Naturalisation and Foreign Affairs are investigating the case.

Brigadier Dr Abdullah Bin Sahoo, Director-General of the department, said they will study CCTV images to check whether the passenger’s allegations are correct and will then take action, Gulf News reports.
