Japanese television company NHK has unveiled a camera that captures and 'digests' four billion pixels per second - capturing 33-megapixel footage at 120 frames per second.

To put that in context, the camera in iPhone 4S is eight megapixels, and cinema reels run at 24 frames per second.

Companies such as Toshiba are already unveiling televisions and projectors with resolutions above 1080p HD - the highest currently possible - and Peter Jackson's new film The Hobbit will be shot in 48 frames per second and 4K resolution, about four times sharper than HD.

The cameras are built to showcase NHK's new 'Super Hi Vision' format and can capture four BILLION pixels per second - shooting at 33 megapixels and up to 120 frames per second

NHK's camera is a demonstration model for its Ultra-HD standard 'Super Hi-Vision' - one of several competing resolutions designed to take televisions beyond hi-def.

Companies such as Sony are already shooting films in 4K - a super-high-def resolution touted as the 'next generation' of high definition.

But NHK's camera is even more extreme - shooting in bursts up to 120 frames per second, at a resolution of 33 megapixels.

Like the 4K cameras used in films, the amount of computing power required is so great that the devices are still bulky.

Several different standards for resolutions 'above HD' will be trialled this year at the Olympics - with the BBC filming some events in

Toshiba's £7,000 ZL2 is the first consumer TV with the technology - although there are no video players on the market capable of showing anything in 4K, or even any discs stored in the format.

There are several resolutions - which could become competing formats, in a similar vein to the battle between VHS and Betamax - from the relatively modest 2K up to 8K.

There are few devices that can play the format, thus far - although if your PC is up to it, YouTube will host 4K footage.

Yours for a mere £7000: Toshiba's 'naked eye' 3D set will be 55 inches, and capable of '4K' resolution - a super-hi-def format four times the resolution of current HD sets

Many films are already shot using 4K cameras.David Fincher's The Social Network was shot and screened in 4K, and an increasing number of cinema films use the format.
