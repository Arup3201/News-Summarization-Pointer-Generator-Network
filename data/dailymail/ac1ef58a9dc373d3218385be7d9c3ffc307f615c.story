He was one of the earliest and biggest scalps claimed by the Independent Commission Against Corruption inquiry into political donations and former NSW Energy Minister Chris Hartcher has now decided to quit politics.

Mr Hartcher, who's alleged to have organised a scheme to funnel illegal donations to Liberal candidates and was also accused of leaking details of the $3000 bottle of wine which would ultimately end Barry O'Farrell's rein as premier, has announced his imminent retirement.

He confirmed on Wednesday that he won't be re-contesting the Central Coast seat of Terrigal in next year's March state election.

Former NSW Energy Minister Chris Hartcher was alleged to have organised a scheme to funnel illegal donations to Liberal candidates and was also accused of leaking details of the $3000 bottle of wine which ultimately brought down Barry O'Farrell's rein as premier. He has announced his imminent retirement from politics

Mr Hartcher's staff allegedly funnelled banned donations from an Obeid family-linked company Australian Water Holdings through a mooted Liberal slush fund EightByFive ahead of the 2011 state poll.

It was alleged that fake invoices were issued to disguise illicit political donations from property developers including Sydney's Gazal family and former coal mogul Nathan Tinkler's Buildev.

NSW Greens MP John Kaye, earlier this year, called for a review of decisions made by Mr Hartcher when he was water and energy minister.

Mr Hartcher's first preference vote in Terrigal increased significantly from 50 per cent in the 2007 election to 60.2 per cent in the 2011 poll.

The outgoing MP is the longest serving member of the NSW lower house and entered parliament in 1988 as the member for Gosford.

'It is time to move on,' Mr Hartcher, 68, said in a statement.

Chris Hartcher confirmed on Wednesday that he won't re-contest the Central Coast seat of Terrigal in next year's March state election. 'It is time to move on,' he said

Mr Hartcher was also accused of using his nephew to launder $4000 in Liberal Party donations through his old law firm and then through a business run by the partner of long-time aide Ray Carter, before 'pocketing' the cash.

He denied instructing Mr Carter - who has admitted to soliciting donations from banned political donors in the lead-up to the 2011 state election - to lie to the inquiry.

During heated proceedings, barrister James Trevallion put it to Mr Hartcher that he showed up at Mr Carter's house unannounced in November last year after ICAC investigators began circling.

'You said to him that you wanted to get your stories straight in respect to the $4000 because you knew it was likely to become an issue at ICAC,' Mr Trevallion said.

'And you told him that he should say, if he was asked, that he kept the money himself.'

'I reject that absolutely,' Mr Hartcher said at the time.

Under cross-examination from his own counsel, Mr Hartcher also slammed suggestions from counsel assisting, Geoffrey Watson SC, that he leaked details of the notorious $3000 bottle of Grange that brought down former NSW premier Barry O'Farrell.

He was one of the earliest and biggest scalps claimed by the Independent Commission Against Corruption inquiry into political donations and former NSW Energy Minister Chris Hartcher has now decided to quit politics

'I deeply resent that question being asked and it was completely untrue,' he said.

In the wake of the ICAC inquiry, former police minister Mike Gallacher has moved to the cross-bench while The Entrance MP Chris Spence and Wyong MP Darren Webber have announced they too won't re-contest their seats.

The ICAC inquiry report is due in January, two months ahead of the state election in which the Liberals will field at least three new Central Coast candidates.
