Middle class shoppers are increasingly turning away from traditional supermarkets and embracing discount retailers such as Aldi, Lidl and even £1 shops in their efforts to bag a bargain.

So it’s little wonder that Tesco, which has seen its market share fall to a ten-year low, is rolling out ‘pound zones’ in 300 stores to try to win back their custom.

But how do Tesco’s £1 buys compare to Poundland’s? JENNY WOOD finds out...

Jenny Wood attempts to find whether Tesco's £1 offerings are better than Poundland's

COTTON WOOL

Tesco: Johnson’s Baby, 75 cotton balls

You may not get that many cotton wool balls for your pound at Tesco; however, the supermarket’s offering is a big-name brand, and the quality shows. 5/5

Poundland: Allura, 125 soft cotton wool balls

These feel a touch more synthetic and scratchy on my skin than Tesco’s offering. They are about half the size, too, meaning you end up using twice as many. 3/5RAZORS

Tesco: SuperMax Confidence 3 for Women (two-pack)

With a comfortable curved handle and handy slip-on cover, these glide well over the skin, leave my legs nice and smooth and should last several uses. 4/5

Poundland: EnergiFlex Triple Blade Power (four-pack)

It’s a close call — or should that be shave? These work just as well as Tesco’s, but although there are twice as many, they’re slightly harsher on my skin. 3/5

PARACETAMOL

TESCO: Panadol Original tablets (pack of 16)

You’ll find this well-known brand in Tesco’s pound zone — and at a price that won’t give you a headache. 4/5

Poundland: Galpharm Paracetamol capsules (pack of 16)

These contain exactly the same amount (500mg) of paracetamol as Tesco’s, and the only difference is the packaging. 4/5

Tesco has announced a new £1 range to put it in direct competition with Poundland

TISSUES

Tesco: Softy tissues (ten-pack)

These decent tissues are as good as my usual buy, Kleenex, in terms of volume, size and thickness. Left my nose nice and soft, and at this price, not to be sniffed at. 5/5

Poundland: Kleenex Original (ten travel packs)

A big name brand and great quality — ideal for stashing in your handbag or pocket. There’s no need for me to pay £1.50 for a pack of six like I usually do. 5/5

PREGNANCY TESTS

Tesco: 1st Aid pregnancy test (two-pack)

With the average High Street chemist charging over £8 for a test, this is an incredible bargain and worked perfectly well for a pregnant friend who tested them for me. 5/5

Poundland: FirstVue One-Step pregnancy test (two-pack)

Slightly less basic than the Tesco version, and when tested by the same pregnant friend, this kit worked perfectly well, and quickly. Why spend more?  4/5

WASHING-UP LIQUID

TESCO: Zingy washing-up liquid (1 litre)

Not particularly thick or overly-bubbly, the large bottle looks great, but you’ll probably end up using more than if you’d forked out for a more expensive brand. 2/5

POUNDLAND: Cussons Morning Fresh 675ml (2 for £1)

This is a great deal — you end  up with 350ml more liquid than at Tesco, and it is a recognisable brand-name. Cut through the grease on my dishes a treat. 3/5

But as our survey shows, for £1 bargains Poundland is still the best

FABRIC CONDITIONERS

TESCO: Comfort Pure (13 washes/455ml)

Yet another big-name brand from Tesco, this is good quality stuff that gives great results. However, it’s a really teeny bottle. 3/5

POUNDLAND: Cussons Morning Fresh Concentrate Fabric Conditioner (30 washes/1L)

We could have bought the same brand as we did in Tesco, as well as this larger bottle from Cussons, which smelt similar and left my clothes feeling almost as soft. I usually use Comfort but would be tempted to switch. 4/5

WASHING-UP BRUSH

Tesco: Bella Brush

This has good quality bristles and the sheer silliness of the design — it looks like a lady in a glamorous dress, whose short, spiky hair forms the bristles — should make you smile when you’re elbow-deep  in suds. 3/5

Poundland: Starwash 2 washing-up brushes

The bargain retailer also sold Bella brushes, but these were a bit more effective, if not as exciting. The bristles are a slightly different shape, letting me get into the nooks and crannies of my dirty dishes more easily. 4/5

STORAGE CONTAINERS

TESCO: Home Connection collapsible food storage container

Top marks for the innovative collapsible design, which folds up almost flat when not in use. Unlike the Poundland containers, it also clearly states that it’s safe to put in the microwave and freezer. 4/5

POUNDLAND: Kitchen Corner food containers (five-pack)

With a wide selection of tubs and containers, Poundland beat Tesco hands-down, yet the quality is a little basic, with slightly thinner plastic. At these prices though, who’s to quibble? 3/5

PEELERS

TESCO: Home Connection comfort-grip peeler

A traditional shape with a chunky, easy-grip handle, this is nice and sharp, and made light work of my potatoes. I can’t believe I paid £10 for my John Lewis peeler when this is exactly the same! 4/5

POUNDLAND: Kitchen Corner vegetable peeler

Available in several bright colours, with an almost identical handle, this comes with a protective blade cover for when it’s not in use. A nice touch, especially considering I have a toddler who likes nothing better than trying to get hold of sharp objects. 4/5

BATTERIES

TESCO: Kodak AAA batteries (ten-pack)

Going head-to-head with the same product, you get two fewer batteries at Tesco and only size AAA was available. 3/5

POUNDLAND:  Kodak AAA batteries (12-pack)

As well as a bigger packet, the discount store also sold other sizes, too, including popular AAs. More power to them, then. 4/5

BIN BAGS

TESCO: Tuklok 20 refuse sacks

A bit thin and liable to tear, but are more than 15cm longer than Poundland’s. The clever ‘tuklok’ has a hole punched in the top at the side, through which you tuck the rest of the bag to keep it shut, minimising spillage. 3/5

POUNDLAND: Tidy Z 40 refuse sacks

You get what you pay for with cheap bin bags, and they are usually, well, a little bit rubbish. These are fairly thin, so you may need to double up. 2/5

DEHUMIDIFIER

TESCO: Jumbo-size scented dehumidifier

Suitable for all areas of the home this contains beads which draw in excess moisture from the air to stop damp, mould, mildew and condensation. This claims to last up to six weeks and has a lovely fresh fragrance. 5/5

POUNDLAND: Green Jem jasmine scented hanging dehumidifier

This works in the same way as Tesco’s dehumidifier, but is designed specifically for wardrobes — removing moisture from clothes to prevent mould — and only lasts up to three weeks.  4/5

TEA BAGS

TESCO: Quick Brew One Cup 80s

The packaging looked cheap, so I quickly decanted these into a tea caddy before my book club came around. Luckily the ladies couldn’t taste the difference. 3/5

POUNDLAND Typhoo One Cup 100s

An impressive range of tea from several well-known brands, and with bigger pack sizes, too. I usually pay £2.20 for Typhoo, so I will definitely be buying my tea from Poundland in future. 4/5

CHOCOLATE

TESCO: Walkers milk chocolate 200g

A little too sweet, and not a patch on Cadbury’s, but at half the price this was more than adequate to satisfy my son’s sweet tooth, with plenty to spare. 2/5

POUNDLAND: Sweet Heaven milk chocolate 300g

My chocoholic husband declared this bar the chunkiest he’d ever tried. Bigger than Tesco’s, with more stylish packaging. 3/5 MINT THINS

TESCO: Walkers Chocolates dinner mints 200g (20 mints)

These are passable, but are made with thinner chocolate than the After Eights you can buy in Poundland and have a stronger, more synthetic flavour.  2/5

POUNDLAND: After Eight Mint Chocolate Thins 170g (18 mints)

The Rolls-Royce of after-dinner mints — these are crisp, subtle and individually wrapped. If you want your guests to return for seconds, head to Poundland. 5/5 CRISPS

TESCO: Walkers ready salted (five-pack)

A good brand name, but the Tesco we visited stocked only ready salted flavour,  which is disappointing. More choice would have been nice.  2/5

POUNDLAND: KP Hula Hoops (six-pack)

When it comes to the crunch, Poundland clearly pips Tesco to the post in terms of overall selection. The shelves are full of big name brands such as Hula Hoops and McCoy’s as well as several flavours of Walkers. 4/5

PASTA

TESCO: DonMario Pasta Twists 500g

A reasonably sized 500g packet of pasta twists which, while never going to land you a place on MasterChef, made a mean pasta bake.  4/5

POUNDLAND: Batchelors Pasta’n’Sauce (2 packs for £1)

It’s a store cupboard staple but Poundland didn’t have any plain pasta in stock on the day we visited — just these portion packs. Available in cheese and broccoli or cheese, leek and ham — all of which tasted like cheap ready meals.  1/5

MUSIC

TESCO: Red Hot Hits (2-CD compilation)

Includes hits by a wide range of artists, including Jennifer Lopez, and Elvis Presley. However, in general Tesco’s pound zone CD collection was small — this was the best of the bunch. 2/5

Poundland: I Love 2 Party  (2-CD compilation)

Boasts Kylie and Wham! for the perfect party playlist. Poundland’s  policy of ‘refurbishing’ second-hand CDs means you can also pick up more recent releases from big names such as Robbie Williams. An impressive selection.  5/5 Final scoreTesco                  65/95Poundland          69/95
