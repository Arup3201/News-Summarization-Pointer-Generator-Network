Burnley's strikers were going through a training drill in the sunshine at Gawthorpe on Thursday, swerving between metal dummies and hitting the back of the net from inside the penalty box with impressive regularity.

Doing it for real this season has proved rather more difficult for the Barclays Premier League’s relegation favourites. They have now failed to score for 616 minutes.

If Sean Dyche’s team draw another blank at Leicester City on Saturday, they will break two club records: their longest goal drought in all competitions of 651 minutes, and the longest in the league which stands at 596.

Scott Arfield scores a stunner against Chelsea in Premier League opener

In their first game of the season in August, Burnley stunned title favourites Chelsea by taking the lead with a wonderful strike from Scott Arfield.

Few were surprised that they failed to hold on to the lead that night, but not many expected the Clarets to draw a blank in their next five league games against Swansea, Manchester United, Crystal Palace (where Arfield had a late penalty saved), Sunderland and West Brom, not to mention a Capital One Cup tie at home to Sheffield Wednesday.

The reality of life at this level has bitten hard. Injuries to Sam Vokes and Danny Ings, last season’s 47-goal strike partnership, have been a significant factor. Dyche compared that to Liverpool losing Luis Suarez to Barcelona and Daniel Sturridge to injury.

But while Brendan Rodgers was given the £75million Liverpool banked from Suarez’s sale to strengthen his squad, Dyche spent just £1.5m on Lukas Jutkiewicz from Middlesbrough and another £600,000 on Bolton’s Marvin Sordell. Neither has scored yet.

‘Look at Liverpool with Suarez and Sturridge,’ said Dyche. ‘They’ve obviously found it tough to lose those players. We had Vokes and Ings who were flying last season.

‘But the challenge is for the next people to come in and deliver performances.

‘Brendan’s team will come good, no doubt, but they’ve spent £100m. We aren’t that type of club. We know the challenge and it’s going to be tough.

‘People were asking last week if we were too defensive. Fact: we’re three points behind Everton who bought a £28m striker (Romelu Lukaku). We haven’t been able to do that. It’s working with what we’ve got and making the best of it.

‘It’s a massive learning curve getting used to this level. It’s not just the attacking in the Premier League, the defending goes up as well. We’ve had goalkeepers who have pulled off very high-quality saves, which is another change from the Championship and the divisions below.’

Dyche remains positive and demands the same attitude from his players. But how does he keep their spirits up when the ball just won’t go in?

‘You look to reinforce their belief systems,’ he added. ‘They’re only human. Not everyone is super- confident and some players sit on that knife-edge.

‘We reinforce the positive side of the game and the simplicity of it. Of course you hope for a goal because sometimes it alters mindsets and re-ignites confidence in people.

‘You’re waiting for the individuals to catch fire within that system and score. There are goals in people, it’s just delivering it. I believe in the players we have at the club, otherwise I wouldn’t have them here.

‘We haven’t gone obsessively into attacking but we’ve obviously tried to tweak things. We have to turn the screw and make sure those chances become goals. Can we make different types of chances than your stereotypical ones like a cross and a header? What kind of crosses, what kind of finishes, what kind of movement in the box?

‘We’re getting into the right area but the hardest thing for coaches and managers to provide is that final touch into the net.’
