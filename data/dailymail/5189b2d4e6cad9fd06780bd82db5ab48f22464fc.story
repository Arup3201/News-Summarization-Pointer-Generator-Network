Rhys Priestland appears to have decided that fighting for his Wales career isn't worth all the grief. Given the extent of it, who can really blame him?

The Scarlets fly-half is off to Bath at the end of the season, having had to endure a torrent of abuse during recent times, in relation to his Test exploits. Sadly, the sort of vitriol aimed at the talented and decent 27-year-old reflects a creeping curse in the game. 

Rugby’s core values, as outlined by the world governing body, are under threat. More precisely, two of them; ‘respect’ and ‘solidarity’, are being endangered by a third; ‘passion’, in its most skewed forms. The bile hurled Priestland’s way is just one of many recent examples.

At around the time the stand-off was under siege, England hooker Dylan Hartley suffered a deluge of abuse on Twitter, after he was harshly sin-binned against South Africa. He revealed several messages to shine a light on the issue and later insisted that bullying is still bullying, even if the target is a robust, front-row forward.

Weeks earlier, officials at the RFU were forced to launch an investigation after Welsh referee Nigel Owens was subjected to homophic abuse at Twickenham.

Two spectators were later banned from the venue. Meanwhile, the use of foul language aimed at officials or the visitors has become a feature of the big-match experience at Thomond Park in Limerick. Once again, the desire to convey passion has been given a toxic twist. 

Wales captain Sam Warburton was victim of abuse on social media last season

On Thursday, former England full back Delon Armitage appealed against a ban for abusing Leicester supporters, partly on the grounds that he was also the victim of unsavoury abuse at Welford Road. At Northampton, a steward is now stationed between visiting coaches and home fans, as a result of ugly exchanges. Elsewhere, screens have been erected to muffle expletive-laden rants. 

This is not a sudden, new phenomenon. Last season, Wales captain Sam Warburton was savaged on social media after signing a central contract, while Gloucester had to stage an inquest after crowd unrest at Kingsholm. But the trend is becoming more pronounced.

Rugby must carefully guard its values and its soul, but all is not yet lost. A week ago at Northampton, as home No 10 Stephen Myler lined up a goal-kick, his half-back partner Lee Dickson shouted instructions to other team-mates and was subjected to tongue-in-cheek heckling from the stands for breaking the silence. That’s the spirit of the game in a nut-shell, and it must be preserved.

Dean Richards was understandably cheerful after last Friday’s game at Franklin’s Gardens. Although his Newcastle Falcons side had lost to champions Northampton, they had fought the good fight, with bold intent. Their performance was a heartening throw-back to the days of the flying Falcons in the era of Jonny Wilkinson, Toby Flood, Dave Walder, Tom May, Jamie Noon and Mathew Tait; when the Tyneside team used local talent from the academy to compete with the best.

Now, the likes of Mark Wilson, Chris Harris, Tom Catterick and George McGuigan are performing with fearless conviction in exalted company week after week. Newcastle appear well coached and in that regard, Walder is said to be working wonders behind the scenes.

Richards appears to repeating the sort of root-and-branch transformation that he oversaw at Harlequins, before being derailed by the ‘Bloodgate’ affair. It is good to see his latest salvage job taking shape and great to see the North East club - with such strategic importance in the bigger, national picture - on the rise.

Vunipola must take fight to Morgan 

England’s coaches will watch the Gloucester vs Saracens Aviva Premiership match at Kingsholm with keen interest, as their two leading No 8s, Ben Morgan and Billy Vunipola, engage in an intriguing personal duel. Morgan has claimed the upper hand in the Test team, but he will be wary of his opposite number’s capacity to wreak havoc, when the mood takes him.

The younger Vunipola brother has been a source of frustration for the national management, having arrived on the summer tour in despondent mood after back-to-back finals defeats with Saracens, then playing without great conviction.

He subsequently started the autumn campaign as first-choice but lost his place amid a flurry of errors, and concerns about his inability to play for 80 minutes at international level. Vunipola should use Friday’s encounter to kick-start a revival ahead of the Six Nations. Fully fit and firing, he is a powerful asset.

Unconvincing denial of the week. Bristol director of rugby, Andy Robinson, responding to Sportsmail’s revelation that Gavin Henson is destined to sign for the club, told the Bath Chronicle: ‘There’s always lots of speculation. Gavin is a talented player who has played well for Bath. We have a lot of respect for the way he goes out and plays the game but I’m not saying either “yes” or “no” as to whether we’re looking at him. One thing you could always say about Gavin Henson is he can play at 10, he can play at 12 and he can goal-kick. So for certain clubs, he is of interest, because he can do that. I will make comment regarding him joining Bristol if a contract is agreed.’ Expect that comment to be a matter of when, rather than if…

Last Word

The salary cap debate rages on with renewed ferocity. This week, Sale’s director of rugby, Steve Diamond, suggested that some Premiership clubs are operating £2-2.5million over the limit. There hasn’t been a stampede of people attempting to knock down his theory. 

His counterpart at Harlequins, Conor O’Shea, has mounted a stirring defence of the cap concept, in his column for ESPNscrum.com, saying: ‘We have a duty to ensure we have a game that is vibrant and sustainable, within the rules. If we do not stick to them… there would be arms race the richest would win. We would not be doing the game the service we owe it as custodians.’ 

This column fully endorses these sentiments. The cap must stay, but every effort must be made to raise the limit based on strong, long-term investment. France is the financial powerhouse nation at present, but money has flowed into the Gallic game since the 2007 World Cup there. With the tournament here this year, the elite clubs must be ready to harness a surge of interest. Then, in time, spending levels can rise to match those of their cross-Channel rivals.
