A mother has spoken of her outrage after a stranger took a picture of her breastfeeding her daughter in public and uploaded it to Facebook, branding her a 'tramp'.

Emily Slough was out shopping last Friday when she stopped to feed her eight-month-old, Matilda, on the steps of a restaurant and have some lunch.

Unbeknown to her, a stranger had spotted her, taken a photo of her and posted it on Facebook, saying: 'I know the sun is out n all that but there's no need to let your kid feast on your nipple in town!!! Tramp.'

Mrs Slough, from Rugeley, Staffordshire, said she was 'shocked' when she discovered what had been said about her

The picture was posted on the Spotted Rugeley page of the site.

Mrs Slough, from Rugeley, Staffordshire, said she was 'shocked' when she discovered what had been said about her.

She told the Birmingham Mail: 'The mentality of the individual that attempted to shame me for feeding my daughter makes me so angry.

'I am very confident and comfortable with my breastfeeding, but I know plenty who aren't and don't even humour the idea of nursing because of some ridiculous stigma attached to it and fear of embarrassment, humiliation and non-acceptance.'

Mrs Slough was sitting on steps outside The Shrew pub when the photos were taken.

Owner Gavin Houston said he
 believes the photos were taken by a young man aged about 18, 
potentially inside the pub.

Mr Houston said: 'We're appalled at what has happened, it's some idiot with a phone.'

Sympathetic: Her campaign to support mothers has garnered huge public support under the hashtag #rugeleymassfeed

Mrs Slough has been inundated with support on Twitter, with the hashtag #rugeleymassfeed gaining momentum by the hour

In response to the stinging attack, Mrs Slough, 27, has now organised a mass breastfeeding protest in the town this Saturday.

The hashtag #rugeleymassfeed has hundreds of posts on Twitter and similar events by other supporters are 
planned to take place in York and Swansea.

Upon announcing the protest, she wrote on
 Facebook: 'I was initially going to ignore the post and laugh it off, 
but then I realised that this is a perfect example of what needs to be 
erased in modern day society.'

She told the BBC she had been 'bombarded' with messages since sharing the picture on Facebook.

'Spotted In' Facebook pages are springing up in villages, towns and cities all over the UK - but it's not clear who exactly is behind them.

They usually feature local information and a 'community noticeboard'-type service all rolled into one.

Most have been set up in the past year and in some places, it's estimated that one in 10 locals is following their 'Spotted In' page.

breastfeeding mum. Go Rugeley!:) #rugeleymassfeed.'

Mrs Slough added: 'Most of them have been positive but some
 people have told me I need to be more dignified and breastfeed in a 
public toilet.

'Why should mothers who are doing the best by their children feel that they should be confined to a toilet or changing room to provide their baby with nutrients?

'Would you eat in a toilet or with a blanket draped over your face?'

She added: 'I'd like to personally thank whoever took the photograph and allowing those in support of breastfeeding mothers whenever and wherever to make a stand and unite against this kind of discrimination.'

The National Childbirth Trust has 
condemned the picture and comments. CEO Belinda Phipps said: 'This 
behaviour is dreadful. For good reason, mothers feeding their babies are
 protected by law.

'The Equality Act, of October 2010, states that it is unlawful for mums to be discriminated against or treated unfavourably because they are breastfeeding in England, Wales or Scotland.

Moving on: In response to the stinging attack, Mrs Slough has organised a peaceful breastfeeding protest in the town this Saturday

'Whether formula feeding or breastfeeding, it is important that mums are able to feed their baby whenever and wherever they need it.

'Any mother who chooses to breastfeed her baby should have the right to do so without harassment.'

Mrs Slough wrote on Facebook this morning: 'I've had an absolutely overwhelming amount of support and I am thankful for each and every one of you who has backed me in my campaign to normalise public breastfeeding.

'Keep up the good work everyone! What you are achieving is amazing!!'

Mrs Slough's campaign to support mothers has garnered huge public support and the Facebook event to publicise the breastfeeding meet-up, at 12pm on Market Street on Saturday, now has more than 1,200 listed as attending.
