A group of gipsies built a giant cannabis factory on the grounds of their camp which they were given a  £1.3million government grant to upgrade.

A well-organised drug operation capable of producing £250,000 of cannabis a year was found when police raided the camp in Merthyr Tyfdil, South Wales yesterday.

Cannabis plants were being grown in sheds and outbuildings on half of the pitches on the three-acre site.

Raid: The cannabis factory was discovered when police raided the three-acre site in South Wales yesterday

Professional: Officers found an extensive operation capable of producing £250,000 worth of cannabis a year

Factory: Officers arrested 16 people living on the site in connection with the production of cannabis

Officers arrested 16 people living on the site in connection with the production of cannabis and three others in connection with separate offences. 

They said a 'small minority of individuals' with links to the site had been involved.

The Glynmill Gypsy and Traveller Site received a government grant of worth £1.3million in 2011 to refurbish the site and build a community centre for its 120 residents.

The money was also used to construct three toilet blocks and to landscape the grounds, according to information from Merthyr Tydfil County Borough Council. 

But officials were tipped off that people living there had been seen buying large amounts of compost and gardening equipment from a local garden centre.

More than 100 officers stormed the gipsy camp in a multi-agency raid. Trading Standards, VOSA, DVLA, the Department for Work and Pensions, and the RSPCA were also involved in the operation.

Cannabis was found growing in 12 of the 24 caravan plots on the three-acre site during the raid. The street value of the illegal crop is estimated at between £60,000 and £70,000.

With an average three-month growth cycle, it means the site was capable of generating more than £250,000 worth of cannabis each year. 

Chief Inspector Phillip Ashby, of South Wales Police, said: 'We were able to act on some good intelligence and put a large and complex operation together.

'Before today, a small minority of individuals linked to the site had done their best to prevent outside engagement with the site, and it is now clear why.

'This now presents an opportunity to build bridges with people at this location and ensure their welfare.

'Those arrested today can expect to be dealt with robustly - we have specially trained officers who will utilise the Proceeds of Crime Act to ensure any assets suspected to be gained through criminality are seized.

'My message to anyone growing cannabis is that it's only a matter of time before we find you, no matter where you are.'
