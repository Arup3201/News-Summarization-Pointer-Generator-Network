Barcelona midfielder Javier Mascherano believes Manchester United have secured the services of one of the top 10 players in the world after signing Angel di Maria this week.

United smashed the British transfer record in paying Real Madrid £59.7million for Di Maria as the Red Devils continue their summer rebuilding under new manager Louis van Gaal.

Mascherano, who plays alongside Di Maria for Argentina, is a huge fan of the 26-year-old winger and believes United's gain is Real's loss.

He told El Mundo Deportivo: 'It's not a matter that concerns me but I think it's a loss (for Real). He's a player who I like a lot. He's among the 10 best in the world.

'As well as unsettling opponents, he's able to defend and covers a lot of ground. You can use him in many positions.'

Despite the praise Mascherano heaped onto his former Real rival, Di Maria struggled to perform at the World Cup in Brazil despite an outstanding season for Carlo Ancelotti's European champions.

The versatile winger will look to recover that impressive form as he prepares for his Premier League debut this Saturday as United head to Turfmoor to take on newly promoted Burnley.
