Award winning actress Samantha Morton, who is set to speak to police over allegations she was sexually abused while living in a Nottinghamshire care home

Award-winning actress Samantha Morton is set to speak to police over claims she suffered sexual abuse at the hands of care home workers.

The Golden Globe and Bafta winner, who spent most of her childhood living in institutions in Nottingham, spoke out last month saying she was abused by two male residential home workers when she was just 13.

She said that the abuse was reported to both the police and social services but neither was investigated.

Now the 37-year-old has agreed to be formally interviewed by officers, who could be set to launch an investigation after the claims surrounding the now closed Red Tile Home in Nottinghamshire.

The actress had previously revealed she had recently spoken to Nottinghamshire Police about her original complaint and was told the report contained only a reference to 'frolicking' and no sexual abuse.

However, a force spokesman today confirmed: 'We have agreed a date and time towards the end of this month to meet with the individual concerned to discuss the matter.'

The double-Oscar nominee said she decided to waive her right to anonymity in the wake of a report detailing sexual exploitation of 1,400 children over a period of 16 years in Rotherham, South Yorkshire.

She told the Guardian that she was subjected to abuse by two different perpetrators during her time in care, but was too embarrassed to report her plight straight away.

She explained: 'I was embarrassed and the people that did what they did to me... I thought they were really nice people, so I was actually really shocked when it happened.'

The actress added: 'I just wanted to go public with this, to say, we know it's rife but why are there not further investigations into other areas? It isn't just Rotherham, I'm sure it's not just Rotherham.

'A lot of people who abused my friends were people in very, very top jobs within the social services. Nottingham in the 80s was rife with that.'

Police are also said to be looking into claims about historic abuse at nine homes across Derbyshire and Nottinghamshire.

A Nottinghamshire County Council spokesman has also said they were hoping to speak to Miss Morton about her concerns.

In 2009 the double Oscar-nominee, who also starred alongside Tom Cruise in Minority Report, backed a Government campaign to recruit social workers in the wake of the Baby P scandal.

Speaking then Miss Morton said she experienced some 'wonderful' social workers who supported her and helped her realise her ambitions.

She said: ''My early life from infancy to leaving home at 16 was spent in care. I had some wonderful social workers who supported me and helped me achieve my goals in life.

'There are many people out there, whether they be children, families, vulnerable adults, even the aged who need a social worker.'
