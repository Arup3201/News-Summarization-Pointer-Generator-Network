Second DUI arrest: Record-breaking multiple Olympic gold medalist Michael Phelps was arrested Tuesday morning on suspicion of driving under the influence

Michael Phelps has tweeted an apology after news broke Tuesday of his early morning arrest on suspicion of DUI.

'I know these words may not mean much right now but I am deeply sorry to everyone I have let down,' wrote the record-breaking multiple Olympic gold medalist Tuesday afternoon. 'I understand the severity of my actions and take full responsibility.' 

The arrest took place in Baltimore City, Maryland, the 29-year-old's home state and was the athlete's second DUI arrest.

Phelps was arrested in 2004 at age 19 for DUI and later received 18 months probation.

It was after 1:30 when Maryland Transit Authority police pulled over Phelps' Land Rover, just past a toll plaza near the Fort McHenry Tunnel on I-395. 

They initiated a field sobriety test, which he reportedly failed spectacularly and had nearly twice the legal B.A.C.

'He was unable to perform satisfactorily a series of standard field sobriety tests,' reads the MdTA statement. 'Mr. Phelps was cooperative throughout the process.' 

Phelps was arrested and taken to a transportation authority station, from which he was later released. 

The 22 gold medal winning athlete was charged with for driving 84MPH in a 45MPH zone, police told TMZ, and for crossing double lane lines. 

The last time news broke of Phelps' antics behind the wheel, it also took place in Maryland. 

In 2004, then 19-year-old Phelps was arrested near Salisbury University in the city of Salisbury and charged with DUI, DWI, violation of a license restriction and failure to obey a stop sign.

As part of a plea deal, the rising sports star pleaded guilty to drunk driving and was sentenced to 18 months probation. 

Phelps apologized Tuesday afternoon--his second such apology. In 2004, at age 19, the swimmer was sentenced to 18 months probation after pleading guilty to driving drunk in Maryland's Eastern Shore

Phelps is the most decorated Olympic athlete of all time and has an astounding 22 medals from three Summer Games, including 18 gold. When he was last arrested for DUI, he announced 'I've learned from this mistake'

He was also made to pay a $250 fine and ordered to pay  court costs of $55.

'I recognize the seriousness of this mistake,' Phelps told a judge in 2004 as 100 spectators looked on. 'I've learned from this mistake and will continue learning from this mistake for the rest of my life.' 

It didn't take long for fellow Olympic swimmer Ryan Lochte to give the media his two cents on Phelps' arrest.

'He just makes dumb decisions,' Lochte told TMZ of his former teammate. 'He has so much money to get a driver. I even have a driver. Just stinks for the sport of swimming.'

Ryan then pulled back a little, telling TMZ he's just glad everyone involved is unharmed.

'He will become smarter from this. Luckily he did not hurt himself or someone else,' Lochte said.

After winning 18 gold medals, two silver and two bronze medals at Olympics in Athens, Beijing and London, Phelps announced his retirement following the 2012 Olympics.

Phelps announced his plans to come out of retirement and return to professional competition at age 28 in April 2014.

In 2009, a British tabloid published a photo of Phelps using a marijuana pipe in South Carolina a few months earlier. A sheriff said there wasn't evidence to charge Phelps with a crime, but he agreed to the suspension by USA Swimming. Sponsor Kellogg Co. dropped him almost immediately, while Subway stayed with him.

In the wake of the photo's release, Phelps said he 'used bad judgment and it's a mistake I won't make again.'

The latest arrest tarnishes Phelps' comeback bid, which produced promising results this past summer even though he wasn't nearly as dominating as he was at the height of his career. He won eight gold medals in Beijing to break Mark Spitz's iconic Olympic record.

A month ago, Phelps won three golds and two silvers at his biggest meet of the year, the Pan Pacific Championships in Australia.

'For my first real big international meet back, we accomplished everything we wanted to,' he said. 'We were able to find out some of the things I need to improve on over the next year, and things I want to improve on. '

With his performance, Phelps qualified for the world championships in Russia next summer, the biggest meet leading up to Rio.

'I'm extremely pleased,' his coach, Bob Bowman, said after Pan Pacs. 'That looked like the real Michael there, so that was very good.'
