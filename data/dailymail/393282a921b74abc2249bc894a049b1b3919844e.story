A French Algerian suspected of having played a role in the Nine Eleven attacks on the US has been arrested and placed under investigation in Paris.

Naamen Meziche, 43, born in the French capital, travelled to Afghanistan in his early 20s and later joined the infamous 'Hamburg cell' in Germany some of whose members took part in the September 2001 atrocities.

Meziche, described as a longtime member of Al Qaida was captured in May 2012 together with three other French nationals in the tribal regions of south east Pakistan which harbour Al Qaida operatives.

He was deported from Pakistan last Tuesday and arrested by French Police acting for the country's intelligence services and an anti terrorist judge.

He was charged on Friday with complicity in criminal acts with a terrorist organisation with a view to committing crimes.

Said to have been under surveillance by anti terrorist agencies for over ten years Meziche has no criminal record in Europe, French sources stressed today.

Investigators wish to question him about information received by the German secret service and criminal acts carried out in the area of southern Afghanistan close to the Pakistan frontier. 

Pakistani intelligence sources said Meziche had links to Younis al-Mauritani, a suspected al Qaeda chief, believed to have planned the attacks in Europe and the US under the direct orders of Osama bin Laden.

Roland Jacquard, head of the Paris-based International Terrorism Observatory, told FRANCE 24: 'Meziche is probably the terrorist who is most familiar with the recruitment channels used by al Qaeda to bring young jihadists to its training camps – and that’s why the French were so keen to get hold of him.'
