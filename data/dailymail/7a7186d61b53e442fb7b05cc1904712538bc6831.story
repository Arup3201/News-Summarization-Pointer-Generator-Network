Tory rebels remained unrepentant last night despite being branded ‘traitors’ by a senior  Cabinet minister.

Education Secretary Michael Gove unleashed his tirade after it was revealed the Government had lost its motion by 13 votes.

But those who rebelled remained defiant.

Tory MP Sarah Wollaston told  Radio 4’s Today programme that humanitarian assistance to Syria should not ‘come in the form of cruise missiles’.

She said: ‘I think this was a good day for Parliament because this was Parliament reflecting the view, very widely held across the country, that we should not be drawn into yet another Middle Eastern conflict.’

Crispin Blunt, a former justice minister, said it was unnecessary for the UK to ‘put our hand on the dagger politically’ alongside the US.

He said he was ‘delighted that the UK relieve ourselves of this imperial pretention’.

He added that a country the size of the UK should not seek to be ‘involved in every conceivable conflict that is going on’. Senior Tory David Davis, who stood against Mr Cameron for the party leadership, said the result was an ‘unfortunate’ setback to the Prime Minister because he failed to make the right argument about why you needed to ‘kill people’.

Mr Davis added: ‘The truth of the matter is when it’s a life and death issue people must vote on their consciences.’

John Baron, a leading opponent of military intervention in Syria, said: ‘The bottom line is [that sending] cruise missiles into an already volatile situation stood the real risk of escalating violence, causing more suffering and indeed spreading the conflict beyond Syria’s borders.’

Richard Bacon, a senior Tory MP, said he had voted against because ‘I was not persuaded of the case for military action and feared it would make things worse.’

But he added: ‘This should not have any implications for the Prime Minister’s leadership. It shows he has the strength to have faith in Parliament.’

One leading Tory MP who wanted to remain anonymous, said. ‘We are living in a febrile atmosphere and any of us who speak up will be painted as traitors.

‘For most who voted against, the concerns were genuinely about Syria, not domestic politics.’

Samantha Cameron and her younger sister Emily

SAMANTHA Cameron’s younger sister reacted with fury when the Government’s plans for air strikes in Syria were defeated.

In a flurry of 11 tweets,  Emily Sheffield, the  deputy editor of Vogue, said she felt ‘ashamed’ the proposals did not make it to a second vote.

She asked: ‘So just wondering, if there’s another chemical attack, what happens?’.

Her outburst comes  days after a minister claimed the PM’s wife was the ‘biggest explanation’ for his approach to the conflict.

The source told a newspaper that Mrs Cameron had urged her husband to do more to ease the humanitarian disaster caused by the civil war after seeing the plight of refugees first-hand.
