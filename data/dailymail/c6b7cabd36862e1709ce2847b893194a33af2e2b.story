Chancellor George Osborne, pictured yesterday visiting a JCB factory in Rocester, Staffordshire, has been accused of using questionable statistics to claim living standards are rising

George Osborne was accused yesterday of using questionable statistics to claim family living standards are rising.

The Institute for Fiscal Studies said voters would be ‘considerably’ worse off at the time of the 2015 election, compared with how they fared in 2010 when the coalition came to power.

A childless couple on the median income will have seen their income drop 6.9 per cent from £481 a week in 2010 to £450 a week in 2015.

The IFS predicted that the Chancellor will have to slash welfare spending by another £12billion after the next election if he wants to keep the pace of the Government’s deficit reduction programme on course.

Failure to fill that black hole will mean that Whitehall departments have to slash spending by 3.7 per cent a year up to March 2019, far deeper savings than the 2.3 per cent a year Mr Osborne has cut by so far.

In a further blow to the Chancellor, the IFS said statistics he cited in his Autumn Statement on Thursday to suggest that the disposable income of families are actually rising are ‘not something with which to measure living standards’.

Mr Osborne told MPs that official figures for disposable income – the sum families have left after paying essential bills – will rise by 0.5 per cent this year and 1.1 per cent next year. ‘Yes, real household disposable income is rising,’ he said.

But the IFS pointed out the statistic Mr Osborne used includes not just household incomes but also the incomes of charities and universities. The think tank said there was ‘something a little bit strange’ about Mr Osborne’s choice of statistic.

IFS director Paul Johnson said: ‘It tells us something about household incomes but it should certainly not be used in isolation to measure how they are changing.’

The IFS gave its analysis as a poll showed that more than half of those who saw the Autumn Statement think it was bad for them. Some 60 per cent thought it was good for ‘rich people’ and just 15 per cent said it was good ‘for people like me’.

Some 40 per cent said they support Mr Balls’ view that the Chancellor is ‘in denial’ about the cost of living, while only 24 per backed Mr Osborne.

The highly respected think tank then backed shadow chancellor Ed Balls’ claims that families are worse off. Mr Balls has claimed the average worker has lost £1,600 a year in earnings after inflation since the coalition came to power. 

Unpopular: A poll found that only 15% believe the Chancellor's autumn financial statement was good 'for people like me' whereas 60% thought it was good for 'rich people'

The IFS said Mr Balls’ measure of living standards is also imperfect since most families judge living standards on what they have left after tax and benefits, rather than simply on their gross incomes used by the shadow chancellor.

But Mr Johnson said Labour’s figures were ‘pretty consistent’ with the evidence from survey data on what had happened to household incomes.

‘We do know from household surveys that income fell sharply in 2010 and 2011. It is almost certainly significantly lower now than it was in 2010. And while it should start to grow it will surely still be below its 2010 level by the time we get to the election in 2015.’

Director of The Institute for Fiscal Studies, Paul Johnson, says voters will actually be 'considerably' worse off at the 2015 election compared to 2010 when the coalition came to power

That is helpful for Labour since Ed Miliband and Mr Balls are determined to fight the next election by asking voters whether they are better off than they were in 2015.

The IFS warned that deep cuts in public spending are still going to be necessary after the next election, pointing out that just 46 per cent of the cuts Mr Osborne has outlined have taken effect so far.

By the end of 2013-14, Whitehall departmental spending will have fallen by just over 8 per cent since the Government’s austerity programme began and without further tax rises or welfare cuts that looks set to rise to 20 per cent by 2018-19.

A Treasury spokesman said the Chancellor would not dispute that the statistics he used were imperfect. He said: ‘As the Chancellor said at the Autumn Statement, the effects of the financial crash on family budgets and the cost of living are still being felt.

‘So, where possible, we have found the money to help hard working families by freezing fuel duty, freezing council tax and taking 2.7million people out of tax  by increasing the tax-free  personal allowance.’

Labour frontbenchers yesterday accused Ed Balls of having ‘no plan’ to deal with rising economic growth and said he should be replaced with former chancellor Alistair Darling.

Senior sources say the shadow chancellor repeatedly refused demands by members of the shadow cabinet to spell out an economic strategy in the event of a bounce back.

Mr Balls was licking his wounds yesterday after his response to the Autumn Statement was widely panned. In his speech Mr Balls went through what one MP called his ‘greatest hits’ of the last three years, denouncing flatlining growth and Mr Osborne’s ‘millionaire’s tax cut’ – but appeared to have little to say about the economy now it is turning around.

House prices rose by nearly £14,000 during the last 12 months – and are going up at the fastest pace in more than six years, figures have shown.

Mortgage lender Halifax said the value of a typical home hit £174,910 in November, up £13,577 on the same month last year and nearly £2,000 higher than it was back in October.

Average prices in the three months to November were 7.7 per cent higher than they were a year earlier, the fastest pace of growth since October 2007.

Figures published alongside the Autumn Statement on Thursday show just how lucrative the recovery in the housing market will be for the Chancellor.

The Office for Budget Responsibility has predicted that property-related taxes – including stamp duty, inheritance tax and capital gains tax – will total around £155billion between now and 2018-19.

That works out as around £71billion more than if the housing market remained flat over the six-year period.

Rob Wood, a former Bank of England economist who now works at Berenberg Bank, said that the revival ‘is key to the recovery story’.

He went on to say: ‘The booming housing market is a big bonus for George Osborne. It will generate higher tax receipts from the likes of stamp duty.

‘As well as that, the improving housing market is partly behind the rise in confidence in the UK which is boosting spending in shops and VAT receipts.’

But he warned that there was still a risk the housing market could end up ‘getting out of control’ and driving house prices ‘up to their bubble peak’, adding: ‘That is bad news for the medium term.’
