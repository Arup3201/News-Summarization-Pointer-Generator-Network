Two members of the House of Lords are expected to be suspended this week following an investigation into allegations of ‘cash-for-access’.  

Well-placed sources say Labour peer Lord Mackenzie of Framwellgate and former Ulster Unionist Lord Laird are likely to be barred for up to six months when the Commissioner for Standards releases his report on Tuesday.

Two other peers who were also under investigation, Labour’s Lord Cunningham and non-affiliated Lord O’Neill, are expected to escape suspension.

The commissioner, Paul Kernaghan, launched his probe after the peers were targeted in an undercover ‘sting’ operation.

Lords Mackenzie, Laird and Cunningham were accused of offering to set up an all-party parliamentary group on solar energy as a lobbying vehicle for a fake South Korean company.

Lord Mackenzie, a former law and order adviser to Tony Blair, was recorded saying that he  had circumvented a ban on hosting events at the Palace of Westminster for paying clients.

And Lord Laird was reported to have said he swapped the task of asking parliamentary questions for paying clients with other lords.

Lord Cunningham, who as Jack Cunningham was a Cabinet Office Minister under Tony Blair, was said to have asked  for £144,000 a year to provide  a personal lobbying service.

A fourth peer, Lord O’Neill of Clackmannan, referred himself to the commissioner in relation  to comments he made during  the sting.

All of the peers denied agreeing to carry out parliamentary work for payment.

The Labour peers were suspended by their party during the probe, but were allowed to continue their work in the Lords.

A Labour spokesman said: ‘If any of the three Labour Peers have been found to have breached the rules, they will remain suspended from the party.

'We will also consider any further action that needs to be taken.’
