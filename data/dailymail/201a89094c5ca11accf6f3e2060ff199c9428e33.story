Twitter CEO Dick Costolo has revealed that he and his staff have received death threats from ISIS

Twitter CEO Dick Costolo has revealed that he and his staff have received death threats from ISIS after the site shut down accounts being used by the terrorist organization.

He said that when Twitter found out the extremist group was using the site to spread news it  would regularly shut down the jihadist accounts - prompting the assassination threats. 

Mr Costolo said: 'After we started suspending their accounts, some folks affiliated with the organization used Twitter to declare that employees of Twitter and their management should be assassinated. 

'Obviously that's a jarring thing for anyone to deal with,' the CEO added, speaking to Aspen Institute president Walter Isaacson, the New York Post reported.

Mr Costolo was discussing the challenge of balancing the ability to be a free and open platform against wider concerns and government intervention at the Vanity Fair New Establishment Summit in San Francisco.

Earlier on in the session, Mr Isaacson had pointed out that ISIS had been using the social media network to spread its message, highlighting the group's use of Twitter to point out the video of the beheading of American journalist James Foley on YouTube.

Mr Costolo said: 'Whenever you have a global public information-sharing channel, you are going to have people that use it for good. It's obviously been a tool for social change, beneficial social change in a number of countries around the world.

But he pointed out that not everyone was using the site for good and jihadist organizations were using Twitter accounts to communicate an extremist message.

'It's against our terms of service,' the CEO said. 'It's against the law in many of the countries in which we operate for them to use it to promote their organization. And when we do find those accounts we shut them down. We shut them down quite actively.'

In the past nine months, ISIS has taken key areas of Iraq, and large portions of Syria. It has also beheaded two Americans and threatened to kill more if the US continues to intervene in Iraq. 

The extremist group has stepped up its efforts to assume control of Syria in recent days, making a crippling assault on the city of Kobani.

A month ago it was revealed that an ISIS-affiliated group was threatening to assassinate Twitter employees that close down their accounts.

Users linked to the extremists tweeted a series of messages  urging 'lone wolves' in the US and Europe to make the firm their target.

A specific warning was directed at staff at the Silicon Valley headquarters, warning they would 'bring the war' to San Francisco. 

One of the calls is believed to have come from Al Musra Al Maqdisia, or The Supporters Of Jerusalem - a Jerusalem-based group that pledged its allegiance to ISIS in February.

The tweets from the now-suspended account, translated by Vocativ, read: '#TheConceptOfLoneWolfAttacks The time has arrived to respond to Twitter's management by directly attacking their employees and physically assassinating them!! Those who will carry this out are the sleepers cells of death.'

It continued: 'Twitter management should know that if they do not stop their campaign in the virtual world, we will bring the war to them in the real world on the ground.'

The user then directly threatened workers at the Silicon Valley headquarters: 'Every Twitter employee in San Francisco in the United States should bear in mind and watch over himself because on his doorstep there might be a lone wolf assassin waiting'.

And finally, they urged Europe to join the pledge: '#AttackingTwitterEmployees is on the agenda of mujahedeen and lone wolves who are across Europe'.

Last month's threats came from the now-suspended account of Al Musra Al Maqdisia, an ISIS-linked group

The social network has been a crucial platform for the jihadis to promote their warped interpretation of Sharia law.

The freedom of speech premise that underlies Twitter makes regulation of extremist propaganda almost impossible.

Tactics have included Twitter storms, spamming the site with their beliefs and calling on Western recruits to join them.

Many of the British and American jihadis that have fled their native countries to join the faction in Iraq and Syria have been tweeting their experiences.

One of the 16-year-old twins from Chorlton that fled to join ISIS in Syria has been tweeting messages to the UK, mocking concerns for their welfare.

Either Salma or Zahra Halane has taken the name Umm Ja'far and tweeted a slew of fanatical messages, including several revealing she still plans to be a doctor - but only so she can treat ISIS fighters.

She wrote: 'I love the name Terror Twin because it makes me sound scary. Isis love it when they make us sound scary because it makes us a big threat so I love it.'

She added: 'I support the executions of Syrian soldiers. It's self defence.' 

However, in the wake of the murders of James Foley and Steven Sotloff at the hands of ISIS, the firm has worked to shut down accounts that permeate the organisation's message. 

Twitter has bureaus across the world.

There are 12 in the US, including the headquarters, and five in Europe.

A further two are in Latin America, three in Asia, one in Australia and two in Canada.
