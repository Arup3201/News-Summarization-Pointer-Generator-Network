Singer Andy Williams has returned home to spend his final days with his family after doctors told him they can do nothing more to treat his bladder cancer.

The Moon River crooner, 84, is now at his Branson, Missouri, home surrounded by his wife, children and friends.

He has asked them to remember the good times and the music he has created over a career that has last three-quarters of a century.

'They are all desperately sad to see their father ­suffer,' a source told the Sunday Express. 'But he has told them all not to cry for him and remember him when he has gone through the music he has loved all his life.'

Williams announced he was suffering from bladder cancer onstage at a show at the Moon River Theater in Branson last December.

He told the audience that he vowed to return in 2012 to celebrate his 75th year in showbusiness.

He said: 'I do have cancer of the bladder. But that is no longer a death sentence. People with cancer are getting through this thing.

'They're kicking it, and they're winning more and more every year. And I'm going to be one of them.'

The singer had missed planned performances towards the end of last year with a then-undisclosed medical condition.

He
went for treatment at the MD Anderson Cancer Centre in Houston, Texas, 
before renting a home in Malibu, California, to be near cancer 
specialists in Los Angeles.

He
has now returned to Branson to be with his second wife Debbie and his 
three children - Noelle, 48, Christian, 47, and Bobby, 42 - from his 
first marriage to actress and singer Claudine Longet.

Williams
had a string of hits in the 1950s and 1960s, including Can't Get Used 
To Losing You and Butterfly, but he is best known for his version of 
Moon River.

He has amassed 18 gold and three platinum albums over the course of his career.

Williams hosted annual Christmas specials on television and performed Christmas shows on the road for many years.

His 1963 recording, It's the Most Wonderful Time Of The Year, is a seasonal standard.

Born in Iowa, he also hosted an Emmy-winning variety television programme, The Andy Williams Show, from 1962 to 1971.

He published an autobiography, Moon River And Me: A Memoir in 2009.
