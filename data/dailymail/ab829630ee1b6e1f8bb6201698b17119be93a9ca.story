The mother of terminal cancer patient Brittany Maynard who chose to end her life on Sunday has given a glimpse into her daughter's vibrant life.

Debbie Ziegler, 56, described everything from cartwheels as a child to volunteering in Nepalese orphanages that made her only child 'smart', 'charismatic', and 'driven'.

A single mom, Ziegler raised Maynard alone in Orange County, California, where she worked as a science teacher.

Tribute: Brittany Maynard's mother Debbie Ziegler (pictured) described how her daughter would cartwheel for hours on end until she could do it perfectly. It was a sign of the love and effort she put into everything, she said

Love: She respected Brittany's decision to take her own life, saying it was her job to 'love her through it'

Last week Maynard cried in a parting message, describing the painful prospect of leaving her mother childless.

But Ziegler insists she feels blessed to have the shared 29 years before her daughter contracted Glioblastoma multiforme - an aggressive tumor in her brain.

'Early on, I told her, "It would be my honor to take care of you, whichever way; if you need to be fed or diapered, it would be my honor,"' she said.

'And that was important for me, for her to know.' 

'She was a smart, pretty and charismatic little girl, so she asked to do a lot of things and she generally excelled at all of them,' Ziegler reminisced to the People.

'If she took ice skating, she'd excel at ice skating,' she said.

'I can remember her doing cartwheels and my telling her, "I could never do cartwheels," but she just worked and worked and worked until she perfected it,' she said. 

She describes doing everything she could to give Maynard a vibrant childhood without siblings or a father. 

'Today I chose to die with dignity': According to friends and family of Brittany Maynard, she passed away in her Portland, Oregon, home after her condition worsened on Sunday. She was surrounded by family and friends

Enriched: Ziegler describes how Maynard, pictured between her mother and husband, felt so strongly about the orphanages she worked in. Even suffering from cancer, she understood she had a high quality of life 

Promise: She has promised to go to Machu Picchu on her daughter's behalf after her passing on Sunday

Plenty of their holidays were camping trips spent in Oregon, where Maynard - who married and took the last name Diaz - moved to end her life by taking advantage of the state's dignity with dying laws.

On Sunday, she administered her lethal medicine and died in her bed at home in Portland surrounded by family. 

Twenty years earlier, she was just miles away dreaming of weddings and playing with her friend. 

'She had a girlfriend, and she'd make clubhouses in these shrubs – dig under the shrubs and make little chairs and take out my silver-plated wedding gifts and bury them in the dirt,' Ziegler said.

In the years that followed, Maynard went on to become a straight-A student at high school before enrolling at UC Berkeley then working in orphanages across south east Asia.

Ziegler said the prospect of her daughter traveling to Asia was frightening, and she was astounded by the way Brittany dealt with the horrific situations she witnessed.

Even after contracting terminal cancer, Brittany maintained 

Ziegler said: 'She'd call me and say, "Oh mom, it's awful."'

Tearful: Brittany wept days before her passing as she described the pain of leaving her mother childless

'She'd try to get supplies and she'd take them to the orphanage, but the supplies never got distributed, so my daughter went in there and demanded to see where her supplies were.

'She said, "I want you to show me where you put the supplies I gave you yesterday. They are for the children."' 

'She made them give them all back to her, and she took them into the room and gave them to the kids.' 

Maynard said, in the weeks before her passing, her biggest regret is that she never got to have a family, having worked extensively with children.

'I'd say most of my sadness centers around how much I wanted a family,' Maynard told CBS This Morning.

However, the experience in Asia had a dramatic effect on Maynard's perspective on life: 'She knows that even with her brain tumor, she's still surrounded by love,' Ziegler said. 'She's still surrounded by comfort and care, and there are societies where that it not at all ever the case.' 

Now mourning the loss of her child, Ziegler said she will one day travel to Machu Picchu in Peru.

She made a deal with her daughter that, after her passing, Brittany's spirit will meet her up there among the breathtaking Inca ruins.
