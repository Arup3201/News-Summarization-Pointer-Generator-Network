Facing jail: Symieon Robinson-Pierre at Inner London Crown Court. He was found guilty of owning a dog 
that was dangerously out of control in a public place

A pitbull owner whose dog savaged five police officers - leaving a scene like 'the sickbay at the Battle of Trafalgar' - is facing two years in jail.

Symieon Robinson-Pierre did nothing while his dog Poison sunk its teeth into four police officers in a 15 minute rampage that left three of them needing surgery.

He ignored pleas to call his heavily built dog off terrified officers, telling them: 'It is not the dog's fault, you should have knocked and I would have let you in'.

Despite the best efforts of officers to restrain the animal, the vicious attack was only curtailed when armed officers arrived on the scene and shot it four times with a shotgun.

The dog, which weighed four-and-a-half stone, pounced on officers as they raided the house in Stratford, East London, in March this year.

It clamped its jaws around one officer's thigh and tried to drag him to the ground as another officer repeatedly hit it in the head with a metal battering ram, to no effect.

That officer eventually prised the animal's jaws open with his baton but the dog turned on him instead, grabbing hold of his right forearm. It went on to attack other officers in the front garden.

He faces two years in jail which is the maximum sentence for owning a dangerously out of control dog in a public place.

PC Duncan West said he had been with his colleague PC Steve Bones when they received a call to make their way to the Stratford address.

He said when he arrived he saw a number of officers standing on a wall 'trying to get away from a large brown dog which was attacking them'. He hit it with a fire extinguisher.

He said: 'I hit it as hard as I physically could. I hit the dog a second time and my colleagues were hitting it with their batons. The dog made no noise, it didn't seem to have any effect on it.

'PC Bones struck the dog with his baton across the head and it turned his attention to him rather than me.

'It tried to attack PC Bones. PC Bones went to the back of the vehicle, he was being followed by the dog. He continued to try and hit it and the dog made its way to the far side of the road.'

Breaking down and struggling to carry on talking before being handed a glass of water, PC West added: 'PC Bones, in an act of selfless bravery, grabbed the dog by the back of the neck. It yelped.

'It had bitten him on the left hand. He managed to pin it to the floor. PC Bones had got an injury to his left hand and he was bleeding very heavily. Initially I thought it had cost him a finger.'

Savage: Mobile phone footage shows a Met Police 
officer having to to take evasive action on a wall, while another is set
upon by the five-stone pitbull Poison outside the Stratford home of Robinson-Pierre

Under attack: As the officer is mauled by the dog his colleague can do nothing but look on in terror

Battle: Officers who eventually restrained the dog had to shoot it four times before it finally gave in

Alarm: Locals said they heard voices shouting for help as the dog went on the rampage outside

Detective Constable Tom Boow, who had 
arrived at the property to execute the warrant with the uniformed 
officers, said that seconds after entering the house he heard PC Martin 
Corderoy screaming as if 'something really bad' had happened.

Describing
the moment his colleagues entered in front of him, he said: 'It seemed 
to me I took one, maximum two steps forward before they came back and 
hit me to stop me from going forward.

'I
didn't quite know why they had come back ... I then heard PC Corderoy 
screaming. It was a scream you make when something really bad happens. I
thought he had been stabbed.

'Then I saw the dog clamping onto PC Merritt's leg.'

Lashing out: A plainclothes officer and another policeman perch on walls either side as their colleague is savaged by the 
animal yards away

Running for cover: The dog mauls the leg of the officer as he flees across the road

moment the dog was shot by armed police

The
dog then moved on to PC Marc Merritt's arm and was 'literally hanging 
off' it as he swung around in an attempt to shake him off.

Det Con Boow said the struggle 
continued out of the front gate, adding: 'By this time, because there 
was so much noise because we were all shouting and the officers who were
being bitten were screaming an in pain, members of the public were 
coming out to see what was going on. People were videoing it on their 
iPhones.'

He said he saw two men come to the 
front door, one of whom was owner Robinson-Pierre, and the 
officers shouted at them to call the dog off.

'I
remember him saying something but I honestly can't remember what he 
said,' Det Con Boow continued. 'I remember him shaking his head and 
hurriedly going back inside the address.'

Violence: The dog's blood spatters the road where armed police shot the pitbull four times with a shotgun, after it had inflicted severe 
injuries on officers executing a search warrant on Robinson-Pierre's home

Extreme measures: The dog was killed with four 
blasts from a shotgun after inflicting hand, arm and leg wounds on five officers who were unable to restrain it

After the attack, Pc Corderoy was rushed to hospital for surgery and was off work for 85 days. He was left permanently scarred by the attack and even now he feels twinges of pain in his leg.

Describing the moment he was mauled, he said: 'Immediately the dog had bitten into my thigh the pressure and sharpness of the teeth going into my flesh was excruciating.

'I never felt anything like that in my life. I was screaming in absolute agony. I never felt pain like that. I was screaming for help, thankfully my colleagues that I work with were on that dog trying to assist me.

'That dog was on me for about two minutes, it was shaking me about. It was ripping and pulling, I could feel its front and lower teeth ripping through my leg.'

He said Pc Merritt managed to get the dog to release its grip on him and he sought refuge in a parked police van. From there he witnessed the dog attacking some of his other colleagues before one managed to scramble inside to join him.

'In the brief moment that we knew we were secure in the van, I could feel blood trickling down the back of my leg,' he said. 'I could feel in a couple of areas of my leg and my trousers were ripped.

'My first thought was quite shocked to see myself with these injuries. I was just thinking to myself how bad is this? What damage has been caused to me?'

Bush and Martin Corderon who were all present during the attack and 
gave evidence at London Crown Court against Robinson-Pierre

Amateur video footage of the attack showed police clambering onto a wall to try escape the crazed dog, with the mauling only ending when a police marksman killed the animal with four shots.

The jury heard it left behind a scene of 'carnage' in the terraced street.

Prosecutor Sam Brown told the jury: 'If you need a useful image in mind of the aftermath of the event, imagine the sickbay after the Battle of Trafalgar and that will give you an idea - carnage.'

Robinson-Pierre, 25, who declined to give evidence, was found guilty of three counts of being the owner of a dog which caused injury whilst it was dangerously out of control in a public place.

He admitted to owning a fighting dog.

Judge Mark Bishop ordered that a fourth count should be dropped as the attack took place inside the house.

Robinson-Pierre was remanded in custody to be sentenced at Inner London Crown Court on September 17.
