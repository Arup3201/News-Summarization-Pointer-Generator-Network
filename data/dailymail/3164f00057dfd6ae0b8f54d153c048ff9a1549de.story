Want to learn how to have safe and healthy anal sex? Simply enroll in Harvard University, one of the most prestigious colleges in the world.

The school, which is number two in the nation, offered a seminar on anal sex on Tuesday aimed at promoting a holistic understanding of that specific type of intercourse despite the fact that it is widely considered taboo.

The student run workshop called 'What What in the Butt: Anal Sex 101' is a part of Harvard's annual Sex Week, a week of programming meant to help students better understand all its parts, even those less discussed.

Top school: The prestigious Harvard University is offering a class on anal sex as part of it's fourth annual student run Sex Week aimed at giving students a holistic sexual education 

Those who attended the class were able to learn, 'anal anatomy and the potential for pleasure for all genders; how to talk about it with a partner; basic preparation and hygiene; lubes, anal toys, and safer sex; anal penetration for beginners, and much more!' says Harvard's Sex Week site.

The course description says that the class will delve into the misunderstandings of anal sex and will be an opportunity for students to ask questions in a safe, comfortable, and knowledgeable environment.

'Come learn everything about anal sex from the experts of Good Vibrations, a sex-positive store located right in Brookline!' reads the  description posted on the official Harvard Sex Week website.

'They will dispel myths about anal sex and give you insight into why people do it and how to do it well.'

RT.com reports that this year's Sex Week is the school's fourth ever and is run by Sexual Health Education & Advocacy throughout Harvard College, or SHEATH.

The group describes itself as being, 'dedicated to empowering the Harvard community to explore their experiences with love and sex by providing comprehensive programming addressing a wide range of issues relating to sex, relationships, dating, sexual health, and sexuality.'

The week long workshop will provide students with condoms and other materials provided by 'the world's largest pleasure product company' California Exotic Novelties.

'We’re always honored to support Harvard Sex Week and everything that SHEATH does throughout the year,' said the company's CEO Susan Colvin.

'We share a common goal: helping people learn and understand sexual wellness,' she said in a statement.

Some students are looking forward to the workshop but like any controversial topic they face critics who are offended by the subject matter.

One student at Harvard named Molly Wharton told The College Fix she feels as though the classes during Sex Week are 'downright vulgar.'

'I can’t imagine that there are not more worthwhile educational programs and initiatives to which Harvard’s resources should be devoted,' she added.

SHEATH's co-president Kirin Gupta defended the workshop to a reporter from MTV.com.

'Saying we don’t need [the workshop] is like saying we don’t need sex education, or should have abstinence-only education, or that people should feel ashamed for doing whatever it is that’s part of their sexual practice,' he said.

'The conservative backlash speaks to the latent homophobia that society thinks so often it has gotten over, and has not. It speaks to these residual prejudices that people [have] when faced with a reality they’re not willing to acknowledge or respect,' he added.
