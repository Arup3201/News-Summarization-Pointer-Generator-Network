When you become an overnight sporting sensation, it's good to have a friend to keep you grounded - especially one who knows exactly what you're going through. 

Fortunately for NBA superstar Jeremy Lin it's fellow sporting icon Tim Tebow he can turn to, after the NFL quarterback confirmed the pair regularly talk on the phone.

Tebow revealed his blossoming friendship with the basketball player as he attended Vanity Fair's Oscar party on Sunday night at the Sunset Tower Hotel in Hollywood.

their sky-rocketing careers

The Denver Broncos quarterback told the New York Post: 'He’s
a good guy and very humble.

'We talk a lot on the phone because I know 
what he’s going through and I’ve been giving him some advice. He’s 
handling it pretty well and staying focused.'

Tebow was also spotted mingling at pre-Oscars parties over the weekend after signing with powerful Hollywood agent Ari Emanuel.

The football player was a popular addition to the celebrity crowd. According to the Post, Glee's Dianna Agron, Serena Williams, Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson, LL Cool J and Taylor Swift all rushed over to chat to Tebow. 

New York Knicks point guard Jeremy Lin, 23, said he was ‘very inspired’ by the 24-year-old quarterback, according to Lin’s former 
Harvard chaplain.

Lin and 
Tebow also share the common bond of their faith. Both extremely wealthy 
players hope to become pastors after finishing their careers and have 
been very open about their Christianity. Lin’s Twitter feed has the 
description: ‘To know Him is to want to know Him more’.

There is also the shared ground of having ubiquitous catchphrases.

Since Lin's breakout 25-point game against the New Jersey Nets earlier this month, 'Linsanity' has swept the U.S. and rescued the New York Knicks from a disastrous season. 

It has also caused a trademark war with seven patent applications filed, including one by Pamela Deese, who is a lawyer representing Lin.

'We talk a lot on the phone, because I know 
what he’s going through, and I’ve been giving him some advice. He’s 
handling it pretty well and staying focused.'

The catchphrase for the former Golden State Warriors player from Palo Alto, California, has been splashed across everything from mobile phone cases and sunglasses to action figures and footwear, but a trademark can take a year or more to register.

The NBA said Lin jerseys have been the hottest selling shirts at its online store since his performance against the Nets.

Lin famously used to sleep on the sofa 
of his New York University student brother Joshua in Manhattan’s Lower 
East Side. However, much like Tebow's hobnobbing at the Oscars - he has 
moved up in the world.

His two-bedroom rental, listed at $13,000 a month, is on the 38th floor of the residences at the W New York Downtown Hotel and looks out over the Statue of Liberty.

Despite not making it to the Superbowl final, rookie quarterback Tebow played impressively in the  first NFL playoffs of his career.

These sporting heroics, as well as his devout religious beliefs, have made Tebow something of a pop culture phenomenon.

Celebrity status: Tebow is not only a favourite with Denver Broncos fans, his good looks and charm have seen him signed to powerful Hollywood agent Ari Emanuel

He has single-handedly inspired the 
craze known as Tebowing  - where fans mimic the quarterback’s pre-game 
prayer stance in photos posted to Facebook and Twitter.

His popularity has led to a surge in sales of his memoir, Through My Eyes: A Quarterback's Journey, as well as having brands jostle to get him to endorse their products.
