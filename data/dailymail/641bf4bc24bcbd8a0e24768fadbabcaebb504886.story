Russia has refused to allow the hit U.S. TV series House of Cards to film new episodes for the show inside the U.N. Security Council chamber in New York.

The show's producers approached the United Nations to request permission to use the chamber and the 15 council members, which include Russia, America and the UK were asked whether it could be used when the council is not in session.

It is thought that UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon agreed to allow two episodes to be filmed in the chamber as a way of raising awareness of the work of the U.N.

However according to diplomats, who spoke on condition of anonymity because discussions were private, Russia refused to grant permission for filming to take place.

It is thought Russia was against using the chamber for filming as they believed it should be free at all times to deal with international crises not for filming TV shows.

Foreign Policy also reported that Russia said the chamber should be' available at any time and at short notice'.

It has also been reported that China, where House of Cards is extremely popular, expressed concern about filming the series in the chamber but would be more accommodating if they were granted script approval.

House of Cards is a Washington-based series starring Kevin Spacey as the conniving politician Frank Underwood and Robin Wright as his wife.

The popular programme charts the rise of Frank Underwood as a Democratic congressman and House Majority Whip as he becomes president.

He comes up with a highly intricate plan to disgrace his enemies and obtain a cabinet position after the President goes back on his promise to appoint him Secretary of State.

It is unclear if Russian diplomats had taken offence to the political nature of House of Cards, but a Russian security expert, Mark Galeotti believed they were just playing it safe.

He told Russia Today: 'It shows the American policy process as thoroughly corrupt and conducted by moral degenerates. Maybe the diplomats were just playing it safe.'

Despite being screened on online streaming service Netflix it has attracted an army of fans with U.S. president Barack Obama even expressing his anticipation for the arrival of the second series in February.

But France's U.N. Ambassador Gerard Araud told reporters yesterday: 'It's disappointing for you, I guess, because you wanted to see the actors.

'It's reassuring because I think the actors would have seemed so much more elegant than we are, you know,' he added laughing.

The U.N. Security Council chamber was re-opened in April last year after being closed for three years for improvements.

The majority of the renovations were paid for by Norway and included new wallpaper, curtains and refurbishing the horseshoe-shaped table where the members of the council sit.

The work is part of an overall programme of improvements to the United Nations' headquarters in New York.
