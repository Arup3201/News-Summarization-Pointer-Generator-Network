After years of pestering dealers to get his hands on a particular Bill Henson photograph, art collector and gallery owner Peter Maddison received a tip-off from a good friend. 

'A mate who was working with Kodak called one day to tell me Bill Henson's got a problem: He's got a flood in his darkroom and he needs money to clean it up. Today might just be your day,' Maddison told the Daily Mail.

And it was. The Henson Triptych, purchased by Maddison for $60,000 at the time, is among 180 photographs now on exhibit - and up for sale - at Maddison's Badger & Fox Gallery in Sydney's Surry Hills. 

He and co-owner Peter Wright have been collecting art for as long as they've been friends - over thirty years.

Their latest exhibition, beginning this weekend, is an 'eclectic' show of  reknown Australian and International photographers gathered in that time.

As well as controversial Australian photographer Bill Henson, Click! includes works by the likes of Max Dupain and David Moore. It features European photographers Andre Kertész,  Henri Cartier-Bresson, Robert Doisneau as well as Americans Irving Penn and Garry Winogrand.

'It really has something for everyone, it's a cracker of a show!' says Maddison, who wanted to put together a mixed collection like the kinds he and Wright would see in gallery windows as kids in London. 

'We never wanted to do that thing where you have one artist or a stable of the same artists. In that way, I think Badger and Fox has brought something new to the Sydney scene.'

Click! begins this weekend at the Fox & Badger Gallery in Surry Hills. The Gallery will display a roster of 40 photographs   until December 22.
