It was the day of reckoning for dozens of looters and rioters who have reduced our streets to lawlessness.

But while the trouble has been largely blamed on feral teenagers, many of those paraded before the courts yesterday led apparently respectable lives.

A postman, a primary school  mentor, lifeguard, charity worker and a father of a newborn baby were among defendants appearing alongside schoolchildren and college students to answer charges ranging from theft to violent disorder.

Some wept, some grinned and others merely stood in blank defiance at the magistrates.

The youngest looter was an 
11-year-old boy who arrived at court in North London accompanied by his 
mother clutching a mobile phone in each hand. He was convicted of an 
unrelated offence only last week and is yet to begin his punishment.

Should rioters have their benefits taken away from them?

One of the eldest defendants was a 
35-year-old new father, who claimed he was trying to buy nappies when he
 was wrestled to the ground by police in a ransacked supermarket.

The majority of yesterday's suspects 
poured through courts in London but many more were expected in the dock 
over coming days in Manchester, Liverpool, Birmingham and Nottingham.

At one magistrates' court, staff were
 preparing to work through the night as cells overflowed and suspects 
were left sitting outside in a queue of police vans.

One official said there were 'mad 
scenes' as colleagues battled to deal with some of the 371 people 
charged by the Metropolitan Police.

Many of those in court were young men
 apparently caught red-handed with stolen TVs, laptops and mobile phones
 worth thousands of pounds.

They were joined by supposedly 
respectable professionals and tradesmen whose lawyers said they had been
 caught up in a 'moment of madness' as anarchy took hold of the streets.

Some stood accused of attempting to incite rioting with incendiary messages on social networking sites.

Judges refused to grant bail in the 
majority of cases, telling suspects they must face a Crown Court judge 
who can impose stiffer punishments.

They were told they must remain behind bars to prevent them joining in fresh unrest.

In a handful of cases rioters were 
dealt with on the spot, including two rioters who were jailed in 
Manchester and a teenager set free after two days in the cells in the 
capital. But the vast majority were held in custody.

Millionaire's daughter: Laura Johnson, 19, was charged with stealing £5,000-worth of electronic goods including TVs and mobile phones

THE GRAMMAR GIRL: Millionaire's
 daughter Laura Johnson, 19, was charged with stealing £5,000-worth of 
electronic goods, including a Toshiba TV, Goodmans TV, microwave and 
mobile phones.

The goods were allegedly found in a 
car being driven by Miss Johnson after a branch of Comet in Charlton, 
south-east London, was raided.

Bexleyheath magistrates heard  that a 'public order kit' of balaclava, gloves and a bandana was also found in the car.

Miss Johnson attended St Olave's 
Grammar School in Orpington, Kent, the fourth best performing state 
school in the country, after transferring from its sister school 
Newstead Wood.

She achieved A*s in French, English 
literature, classical civilisation and geography A-levels, and is now 
studying English and Italian at Exeter University.

Her parents, Robert and Lindsay 
Johnson, live in a large detached farmhouse in Orpington. It has 
extensive grounds and a tennis court. They sold their previous house, 
near Greenwich, for £930,000 in 2006.

Miss Johnson's parents, who supported her in court, run Avongate, a direct marketing company.

Her father is a businessman with 
directorships in several companies. He was a director in a company that 
took over the Daily Sport and Sunday Sport newspapers in 2007.

During her schooling, Miss Johnson 
offered her services as a tutor. On a website she wrote: 'I was a 
student at Newstead Wood School for girls and gained four A*s and nine A
 grades at GCSE.'

Miss Johnson indicated a plea of not 
guilty to five counts of burglary and was granted bail on condition that
 she does not associate with the two men allegedly found with her.

She must wear an electronic tag, 
submit to a curfew between 7pm and 6am and not enter any London 
postcode. She is due to return to court on September 21.

Camberwell Green magistrates heard 
that a 17-year-old and Alexander Elliot-Joahill, 18, were allegedly 
passengers in the car. Both were denied bail and will next appear on 
September 7.

THE 11-YEAR-OLD: The boy from Romford, Essex, is the youngest person to appear in the dock over the riots.

Brought to Highbury Corner 
magistrates court by his mother, he admitted stealing a £50 waste bin 
from a branch of Debenhams. He was arrested on Monday evening with a mob
 of other children reaching through a broken window.

It emerged it was not the child's 
first experience with the courts as he was already on a 'referral order'
 for another, unrelated offence.

Charges of violent disorder were 
dropped, and he was released on bail under a 6pm-6am curfew. He may 
leave his home only if accompanied by a family member.

Leaving court, the boy set off alone 
down the street, before his aunt and mother chased after him, dragging 
him back by the scruff of his neck.

His mother screamed and swore at the media and was later seen shouting at her son.

THE POSTMAN: Jeffrey
 Ebanks, 32, and his student nephew Jamal Ebanks, 18, were allegedly 
caught in a car stuffed with electrical goods near a looted Croydon 
superstore. The teenager, who admitted burglary, claimed he had been 
'led astray' by his uncle.

THE SCHOOLBOY: Alexander
 McQuarrie, 16, from Ibrox, in Glasgow, was remanded in custody over 
claims he attempted to incite others to riot by setting up a  Facebook 
group entitled 'Let's start a riot in Glasgow'.

THE NEW FATHER: Jason Matthews, 35, was arrested in a branch of Tesco in East Dulwich, South London, on Monday night.

Wearing a bandana over his face, he told police he 'was not one of the bad ones' and had gone out to get nappies.

Thugs caught looting and rioting could be thrown out of their social housing, a council said today.

Westminster Council hopes to kick out tenants who have been in mobs smashing windows and breaking into shops.

Housing minister Grant Shapps has backed moves to evict tenants who have taken part in criminal and anti-social behaviour but lawyers have said it may not be that easy.

The council must show that the disorder happened in the immediate area around the property - and the individual must have been found guilty in the crown court.

Jonathan Glanz, Westminster Council cabinet member for housing, told the Guardian: 'Social housing isn't a right, it's a privilege and if people abuse that privilege then in common with anyone else they should face the consequences.

'Families have to take responsibly for children living in their households, and we have a responsibility to our communities at large.

'Many people living in these communities are playing by the rules and were not involved in criminal activity over the last few nights. They wouldn't want to live next door to people who are getting away with bad behaviour and enjoying the privilege.'

THE STUDENTS: A
 teenager who received taxpayer funding to complete his studies walked 
free after admitting stealing two Burberry T-shirts from a Hackney shop.

IT student David Attoh, 18, was told the two days he had spent in cells should serve as his punishment.

Adam Ozdas, 19, was stopped by police
 in Hackney while carrying a bottle of Southern Comfort, National 
Lottery scratchcards, tobacco, cash and sweets. The Hackney student 
claimed he found the goods and was on his way to a police station to 
hand them in.

Jack Onslow, 18, admitted raiding a 
Bethnal Green shop. The East Ham College student, who aspires to be a 
hairdresser, was found hiding in a fashion store.

THE DRUG DEALER: Haramein
 Mohammed, a 25-year-old  convicted drug dealer, was caught  trying to 
steal from a Costco warehouse in Walthamstow after being released from 
prison on licence.

THE LIFEGUARD: Aaron
 Mulholland, 30, who works at Peckham Pulse health club, wept as he 
appeared in court accused of joining thieves at Foneworld store in 
Camberwell.

His lawyer said he had 'learned his lesson' after spending two nights in a cell and was 'absolutely disgusted' with himself.

THE SCAFFOLDER: Christopher Heart, 23, shouted he was 'sorry for the inconvenience' and broke down in tears after admitting burglary.

The father of two was caught in JD Sports in Hackney.
