Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho's attempt to influence football's decision-makers is not working, according to former Manchester United midfielder Paul Scholes.

Mourinho has been left fuming by a series of decisions that he considers to have gone against his side this season, leading to his appearance on Goals on Sunday last weekend to air his grievances.

But Scholes, writing in The Independent, believes some of the Chelsea manager's actions have backfired, and that he doesn't possess the same level of influence as his former manager at Old Trafford, Sir Alex Ferguson.

'There is no campaign against Mourinho but there is clearly an unwillingness by referees, and the FA, to be pushed around,' said Scholes.

'There is no doubt that my former manager Sir Alex exerted an influence over some referees. He was the master of dropping a comment into his Friday press conference – for instance, how long it had been since we had been given a penalty, or the treatment meted out to a player like Cristiano Ronaldo. It was always calculated and delivered calmly.

He added: 'I think some of them wanted to please him (Ferguson). I don’t mean that they did us favours. It was more that they were very keen not to make mistakes in our games. That when they came to Old Trafford they wanted to be on top of their game and get everything right.'
