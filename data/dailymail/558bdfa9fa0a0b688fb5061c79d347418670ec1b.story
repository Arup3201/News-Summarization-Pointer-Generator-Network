The man who once shared a sprawling Las Vegas mansion with his lover Liberace and was lavished with jewels and furs and plastic surgery, is now broke and behind bars for theft.

Scott Thorson was rescued from a miserable home life by the over-the-top entertainer when he was just 16. The two became lovers, according to Thorson, and possibly something more.

‘It was strange,’ the 54-year-old told ET in April. ‘It was kind of like a father/son relationship. But we had sex.’

Then: Scott Thorson once lived a lavish life as the young lover of showman Liberace but says the pianist forced him to get plastic surgery to look like his son

Interviewing from a Nevada jail, Thorson recently sat for a lengthy New York Times profile about his roller coaster of a life.

For instance, Thorson revealed not long ago that Liberace convinced him to get extensive facial plastic surgery to make him look like Liberace’s own offspring.

‘He had a doctor fly from Beverly Hills,’ Thorson told ET. ‘And he had a big portrait on the wall of himself. He said, “I want you to make him look like he's my son.”’

With his now pointier nose and cheek bones, the former hunky on-stage chauffeur for Liberace bemoaned his inability to make $15,000 bail.

‘All these people are getting rich from my story, and here I sit,’ he complained to the Times from detention in Washoe County, Nevada.

Though he received a reported $100,000 for the film rights to his autobiographical book,  ‘Behind the Candelabra: My Life with Liberace,’  he pled guilty to stealing and using someone else’s credit cards.

Directed by auteur Steven Soderbergh, the film adaptation of Behind the Candelabra stars Matt Damon and Michael Douglas.

Now: Thorson seems to have fallen far, having recently pleaded guilty to stealing a credit card and using it to buy a Reno hotel room

The movie has created a lot of buzz in recent months, likely because it does just what the title implies. While alive, Liberace was fiercely private about his homosexuality.

But Thorson’s life appears just as interesting, at least the parts that one is able to believe.

In 1982, Thorson says he and Liberace abruptly parted ways when the extravagant star kicked him out of their Los Angeles penthouse, in part because of the younger man’s drug use.

Tell all: Thorson penned a book, 'Behind the Candelabra,' in 1988 which has become a soon-to-air HBO film

Thorson would later embroil his old lover in a high-profile palimony suit. He asked for over $100 million but ultimately received $95,000.

Thorson bounced around the country and claims he was even once in a high-profile Hollywood murder trial that forced him into the witness protection program.

Accounts of what went on since then vary. Old friends of Thorson’s often seem to remember things differently from him.

But what is certain is that he wasn’t busy making a lot of money. Thorson now says treatments for advanced colon cancer have left him penniless.

None of this, of course, is in the HBO film. Nonetheless, you can catch its premier May 26 at 9pm.

Fallen: Thorson does a jailhouse interview with Entertainment Tonight. The story of the 54-year-old's life with Liberace airs on HBO May 26
