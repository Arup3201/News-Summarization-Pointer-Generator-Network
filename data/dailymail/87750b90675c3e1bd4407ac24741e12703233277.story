Forget the aroma of freshly baked cakes. In the Great British Bake Off kitchens, innuendo is in the air.

And the show’s legions of fans are swooning at every mention of soggy bottoms, beautiful wobbles or frothy peaks.

Such cheeky catchphrases have even spawned Bake Off bingo, a game in which viewers, pens at the ready, tick off each mention on a card.

Some even turn the show into a drinking game, rather rashly downing a shot every time a judge, contestant or host utters the enduring favourite.

On Tuesday night, some of the 5.4million watching must have been decidedly worse for wear as the bakers unleashed a barrage of ‘soggy bottoms’ while trying to impress judges Paul Hollywood and Mary Berry with their pies and tarts.

A mere two minutes in and the episode’s star baker Kimberley Wilson declared: ‘The terror of a soggy bottom has been keeping me up all night. If my bottom is dry today, all will be well.’

Within the next 15 minutes, it was mentioned another ten times and went on briefly to become one of the most used phrases on Twitter.

As another contestant embarked on the challenge to make an apple pie, host Sue Perkins warned:  ‘I hope Granny Smith doesn’t have a  damp bottom.’

Paul Hollywood, judging Christine Wallace’s efforts, issued a stern rebuke.

She looked a little tearful after he declared: ‘One of my pet hates in a pie is a soggy bottom – you’ve managed to get a soggy top.’

On Twitter, they were loving every sugar-crusted moment.

‘The Great British Bake Off was pure gold for innuendo bingo tonight,’ one viewer wrote.

Another said: ‘Do NOT play the Great British Bake Off drinking game unless you want to lose all your dignity, and especially not in pie week. Good Lord.’

It was not just the innuendo bingo that was a hit with the BBC2 show’s fans.

Others delighted in counting off a string of puns.

Introducing the show, Miss Perkins said it was ‘a life of pie’, referring to the hit film Life Of Pi.

Later on, a contestant promised to produce a geometrical bake he dubbed ‘pie-thagoras’.

Another said his Greek pastry would ‘throw a Spanakopita in the works’.

Now in its fourth series, Bake Off  has seen its ratings grow year on year, prompting speculation it may soon move to BBC1.

Yesterday electrical retailer Currys said it had seen a 65 per cent rise in sales of kitchen mixers, which it attributed to the popularity of the programme.

Fans have been inspired to take to the kitchen and produce their own efforts – although care must be taken to avoid a soggy top.
