Traditionally, interns are paid a pittance to do all the jobs no else wants to do in an effort to get experience in a competitive job market.

At Google however, not only do interns work on developing projects, they are paid $6,000 a month and given a host of benefits including housing, gym membership, bowling and food - all for free.

The web giant's student opportunities were already coveted, even before the release of Vince Vaughan and Owen Wilson's film The Internships this week.

Open to opportunity: As competition for tech talent grows, Google offers internships that pay up to $6,000

Not only has Google topped Fortune 500's top U.S company to work for, it also has the highest-paying internships, according to Glassdoor.

On average, interns are paid 
$5,800 a month, although a specialized software engineer can make as much
as $6,700.

Potential interns must commit to three months of full-time work, meaning most will make about $18,000 during their time at the Mountain View, California headquarters.

'Actually, it's not that surprising that
interns at a company like Google are getting paid so handsomely,' Scott Dobroski, from Glassdoor, toldÂ CNN Money. 'The 
war for tech talent continues to rage on.'

Microsoft and Amazon also pay interns more than $5,500 a month. In some cases, research interns at Microsoft are paid $7,000 a month, according to Glassdoor which compiles information sent in from employees and interns.

The equivalent full-time salary for a Google intern is $72,000 - about $30,000 higher than the average starting salary for graduates.

Figures from the National Association
of Colleges and Employers in January showed the average salary for 
graduates working in their study field was $44,455.

In
addition to topping the highest paid intern list, Google also has one of the highest numbers of interns - taking 1,500 a year from nearly 40,000 applicants.

It also has a reputation for an extreme interviewing process, although according to Business Insider, the company has prevented its interviewers from asking candidates questions such as 'How many cows are in Canada?'

Candidates have to pass two 45-minute, highly technical phone interviews, where they can be asked to write code.

Work experience: Intern Rohan Shah says Google workers are creative and active

Once accepted, they face interviews with up to five departments to determine where they will fit in best.

Although interns are not allowed to discuss their time at Google afterwards, a 20-year-old University of Illinois student has offered insight into the competitive application process and life as an intern.

Rohan Shah told Business Insider, 
that three months and several interviews after applying for an 
internship, he found himself at the Mountain View headquarters.

Rohan was put up in free corporate housing, with three other interns from Argentina and Ukraine for roommates.

And, with free shuttle buses, cycles to get around the headquarters and free food, the $6,000 a month pay was not wasted on basic living costs.

He said after a week of being there he felt like he had worked for Google his entire life.

Like
many other interns, he said the biggest perk was the endless free food 
from 24 cafes offering everything from Mexican and Indian food, to salad
bars and burger joints.

Rohan also caught a glimpse of Google co-founder Sergey Brin once, while he and three friends were at the on-site bowling alley.

The
student, who has since been offered a full-time position at Google, 
added: 'One thing that really surprised me working at Google was that 
every single employee is extremely creative and extremely active.'

He added: 'There's a very clear divide between work and life. Google engineers are very well-balanced. I have evidence that people really are the best thing at Google.'

Google interns have a reputation for positive feedback about their experiences.

'At Google, we see themes that interns speak very favorably about working on innovative technology and building products that touch the lives of millions and are changing the world, which also involve collaboration with bright colleagues who are willing to help and teach them,' Mr Dobroski told The Huffington Post.

The experiences of Google interns is also shown to be higher than any other company.
