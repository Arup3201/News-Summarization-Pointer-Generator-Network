Relive Sportsmail's coverage as Real Madrid scraped past La Liga minnows Cordoba on Saturday with a late show.

Gareth Bale struck home a penalty just minutes after star forward Cristiano Ronaldo saw red for slapping an opponent.

Nabil Ghilas had put the hosts in front after just three minutes, before Karim Benzema equalised. 

Host commentator

The Cordoba players are clapped off the pitch, and rightly so. Incredible scenes at the end as Ronaldo is sent off for the limp Galacticos before Gareth Bale saves the day.

Real extend their lead at the top, somehow.

Of course, Bale scores. Who needs Ronaldo? Boos ring out at the Estadio Nuevo Arcangel.

So harsh on Cordoba. The hosts have hung on so well but 10-man Real have got lucky. Bale's free-kick strikes a hand in the wall and the referee has no hesitation.

Ronaldo is sent off! The star forward has had a poor day at the office and he is red carded after slapping (and kicking the defender). He was caught in a scuffle just before that as well.

70mins: Carlo Ancelotti can't bring off one his front three, can he? Left back for left back.

68mins: So close for Cordoba. Andone goes clear after a poor back pass, loops the ball over Casillas but the ball bounces and hit the bar. Unbelievable.

63mins: Not exactly an attacking sub, but Khedira looks shattered. On comes Illarramendi, who has been linked with a move to Arsenal. Can he kick Real into life?

55mins: Close again from Cordoba. Cartabia's shot fizzes just wide of the post. So flat here today, Real. Bebe then tests Casillas again with a low effort. He's getting closer...

53mins: Cordoba still not sitting back! A free-kick is met and the header loops back across goal but Varane just gets his head to it ahead of Ghilas.

Away we go. Real Madrid can't get any worse, can they?

Closer than we thought it would be, that's for sure. It's been more the half of Bebe than Ronaldo, the Cordoba man has been superb.

Still, Ronaldo go in at half time level, which is probably more than they deserve.

34mins: Benzema again goes close at the back post, Ronaldo there too. Real Madrid really knocking on the door now.

I would normally be saying a Real Madrid goal has been coming. But it hasn't.

So cruel on the hosts as a Gareth Bale flick on is pocked home by Karim Benzema in what was Real's first real chance of the game.

24mins: First sight of goal for Cristiano Ronaldo, who I don't remember touching the ball this half.

His free-kick sails harmlessly over the bar though. He promptly looks to the heavens.

18mins: Bebe goes close again! The former United winger makes space on the right edge of the box but his shot whistles past the post with Casillas motionless.

Minutes later, his volley his straight at the Real goalkeeper.

15mins: Closest Real have come so far. Benzema finds space at the back post but his volley is punched away by the goalkeeper. Gareth Bale was nearby but was flagged for offside.

13mins: Very fast start here from the hosts. Bebe again dances away down the right but his cross is way overhit and it's a goalkick. You'd think they will need more than one to get anything out of today's game.

8mins: Forward they come again! Bebe breaks away but his cutback to Andone is deflected. Looking for that second goal on the counter, here.

What a start for the minnows! Nabil Ghilas scores his sixth goal of the season, sending the ball into the top right corner. No chance for Iker Casillas.

Cordoba go straight on the attack... and they've got a penalty! A shot is hit hard towards the goal and it strikes Sergio Ramos' hand.

Not much he could have done there, bit harsh. But what a chance!

Got a feeling of a cup game this one. Small stadium, fans close to the pitch - the tunnel the players walked through looked a bit like a greenhouse, which is nice.

Yes - there was a familiar name in that Cordoba starting XI... it's Bebe!

The former Premier League flop is on loan with the La Liga side having failed to impress at Benfica. 

He's played twice, and is yet to score. Is today his day?

So says the front page of Spanish publication AS this morning.

J. Carlos, Gunino, Pantić, Crespo, Edimar, Deivid, Rossi, Bebé, Fede Cartabia, Ghilas, Florin

Subs: Saizar, Pinillos, Abel, Vico, Fran, Garai, Silva
