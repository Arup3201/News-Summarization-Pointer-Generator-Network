A 23-year-old Louisiana woman with a DWI charge beneath her belt was arrested again on Thursday for claiming she was an 18th Judicial District Court employee and attempting to destroy her 'incriminating' toxicology report.

Not only did she call the crime lab from her own cell phone, she wrote them an email from her personal account claiming to be an employee of the court saying that the toxicology sample should be destroyedÂ  'because the case had been dismissed and was not going to be prosecuted.'

Just before 11:00 am on April 12, Jana L. Pourciau of Maringouin lost control of her Lexus RX350 as she was driving northbound on LA Hwy 977, south of LA Hwy in Pointe Coupe Parish.

Jana L. Pourciau, 23, who was charged with DWI on April 12, created a fake name and called the crime lab from her own cell phone and told them to destroy her toxicology report

Jana Pourciau told the crime lab to destroy a toxicology report from her April 12 crash 'because the case had been dismissed and was not going to be prosecuted'

'The Lexus ran off the roadway, struck the fence of an elementary school and overturned,' said Louisiana State Police officer Jared Sandifer.

The young woman was arrested for a DWI, not wearing a seat belt, and careless operation after police thought she may have been drinking and driving.

Nola.com reports that when Pourciau was taken to Baton Rouge Medical Center for her injuries, staff also grabbed a toxicology sample.

10 days later on April 22, Pourciau called the Lousina State Crime Lab from her own cell phone number under a psuedonym. She also contacted them from her personal email account using a fake name.

Detectives caught wind of Pourciau's fake phone call and email and they brought her to the station for questioning.

Pourciau confessed that she called and emailed the crime lab in order to destroy the toxicology report from her crash.

She was arrested for false impersonation and forgery and was booked into the East Baton Rouge Parish Prison.
