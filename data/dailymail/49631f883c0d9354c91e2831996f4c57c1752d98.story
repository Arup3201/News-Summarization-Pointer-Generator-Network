A Florida mother who blogged that her two-year-old son was attacked at Walmart for wearing a pink headband is a self-confessed 'pathological liar' who police believe may have 'made up' the entire story.

Lake County Sheriff's deputies said Walmart was still searching for any evidence that Kathleen Carpenter was in fact in the Clermont Walmart the day she claimed an unknown man yanked the headband off Dexter, 2, pushed him and hurled homophobic abuse at them both.

The woman failed to report the alleged assault to Walmart management or police but blogged about it for the Huffington Post, sparking intense outrage about the treatment from LGBT supporters across the internet.

The news website has now pulled the article and a sheriff's report read: 'Based on the continuing media response through Facebook and generated response to the incident by online subscribers, possible video of the incident may be obtained and viewed to in fact verify that the incident actually did occur or if it was all made up.'

Made up? Kathleen Carpenter, pictured, confessed on her blog to being a 'pathological liar' and embellishing stories

Meanwhile, internet skeptics have 
revealed Carpenter, who writes under the name, Katie Vyktoriah, described herself as having been a pathological liar in the past.

'It didn’t matter what I was discussing,' she wrote on her blog 'A Mother Thing' in November 2011. 'If I saw the chance to embellish in some way, I jumped on it, re-telling the same story again and again to different groups with different details.

Elsewhere on her blog she claimed
 to have survived three failed kidnapping attempts and one successful 
one; to have been a stewardess for an airline and quit just weeks before
 the flight crashed twice in three months and to have missed catching a 
train that later crashed.

She
 also claimed to suffer from Celiac disease, diabetes, lactose 
intolerance, BPD, manic depression, ADHD, and declared her breasts were 
so spectacular they cause bar fights.

When
 called on the truthfulness of these claims, Katie responded, according 
to Get off My Internets: 'Yes, much of that list was tongue in cheek to 
drag out some of my sillier stories into much bigger dramas than they 
were. When I wrote it more than a year ago, I drew people's attention to
 it as a FUNNY (though accurate) representation of some of the stuff 
I’ve been through in my life.'

Verbal assault: The mother of two said her son was called a f***** for wearing a pink headband to Walmart

A Huffington Post editor wrote that they pulled the blog at Carpenter's request.

'HuffPost provides a platform for bloggers to share their thoughts and experiences,' it said in the editor's note. 'In a post published last week, an author described witnessing an incident that is now being investigated by local law enforcement. At the blogger's request, we have removed the post. We have also confirmed with investigators that they are in contact with the author.

Reporting deputies committed Carpenter for a psychiatric 
assessment earlier this week after she began talking about suicide.

The
 woman sad she became stressed from receiving a barrage of threatening 
phone calls and emails. Carpenter told Polk County police the family had
 been inundated with threats since details of the incident were 
published.

After she 
reported the harassing calls over the weekend, the mother-of-two was 
taken to a hospital as she struggled to cope with the publicity, 
according to the Orlando Sentinel.

Concerned for her well-being, police arranged for Carpenter to have a mental health assessment, under Florida's Baker's Act.

As well as phone calls, the mother-of-two received more than 11,000 emails.

Harassed: Kathleen Carpenter, pictured with Mark Reed and their children, was committed for threatening suicide after the blog went viral

In a police report Carpenter told deputies 'that the attention obtained by her story and the negative 
comments and communications to her had become too much stress and she 
could not handle the situation ... anymore,' and was thinking of killing 
herself, the Orlando Sentinel reported.

In
 her original blog post, she explained that a man approached her son at 
the check out and knocked a pink hairband from his head, which he had 
been wearing after playing dress up.

She claimed the man then said: 'Your son is a f****** f****t. 
He'll get shot for it one day,' before walking off and leaving Carpenter shaking as she tried to comfort her son.

Some people doubted her story immediately and questioned her decision to not inform police.

The
 31-year-old has since closed her blog and Twitter account and, in a 
Facebook post seen by News 13, she said: 'I am going to be offline for 
the next while until all of this is resolved.'

In
 her blog, she explained how she confronted a stranger who had knocked 
the headband from her son and told him: 'You'll thank me one day 
little man.'

Carpenter 
said in her blog that her son just enjoyed playing dress up, and added 
that two-year-old children did not have any sexuality.

MailOnline has attempted to contact Carpenter to request a comment on the claims but was unsuccessful.
