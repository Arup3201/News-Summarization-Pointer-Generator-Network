He is the architect of David Cameron’s eye-catching shift to the left.

But critics have questioned why Lino Carbosiero, the hairdresser responsible for the Prime Minister’s side parting, has been given an MBE.

The crimper to the stars, who has also styled Madonna, Adele, Sir Paul McCartney and Amanda Holden, was recognised for ‘services to hairdressing’ in the New Year’s Honours last week.

His Twitter page is now full of congratulations from colleagues calling him ‘an inspiration to the industry’.

It is understood that he was not nominated for the honour by the PM.

Last week Mr Cameron was accused of the ‘worst kind of cronyism’ after a number of people close to him, including a City public relations executive he has holidayed with and a former deputy chairman of his local party, were given awards. Apprentice star Karren Brady, who introduced George Osborne at the Tory party conference, got a CBE.

Mr Carbosiero has been cutting Mr Cameron’s hair for the past five years, having been introduced by the PM’s wife Samantha.

He was credited with creating a slicker look for him, moving his parting from the right to the left, with shorter sides and more height on top.

He said last night: ‘I just did what felt natural’, adding: ‘David Cameron is an amazing guy. Both he and Samantha are family people and really nice.’

Mr Cameron's changing hairstyle has often been the topic of much discussion in sketchwriters' columns. Mr Carbosiero is believed to be responsible for the Prime Minister's decision to change his parting from the right to the left in 2007

The
 decision to move his parting from the right to the left in 2007 sparked
 claims he was attempting to look more 'butch' or cover up a receding 
hairline

The father of four is a consultant 
style director at upmarket hair salon Daniel Galvin in Marylebone, where
 a cut and blow dry costs up to £72 for men and £126 for women.

He
 said he panicked when he received the notification of his MBE, saying: 
‘I didn’t expect the letter so I thought I hadn’t paid my tax!’

He said he believed he had been honoured for campaigning to have hairdressing recognised as a profession.

‘There are no checks or exams at the moment,’ he said. ‘I want young hairdressers taught in the proper way and to get a qualification that’s recognised. It’s more than just standing behind a chair and chatting.’

In a 30-year career he has built up a client base of famous names including Dustin Hoffman, Phillip Schofield and Ant and Dec. He has also written a newspaper column and done charity work, including raising £25,000 by running the London Marathon in 2005.

It is not the first time an influential hairdresser has been honoured. The Queen gave her stylist Ian Carmichael, of the Dorchester Hotel’s Royston Blythe salon, a royal warrant in 2012, while Jo Hansford, who counts the Duchess of Cornwall among her clients, received an MBE in 2009. Daniel Galvin, who runs the salon where Mr Carbosiero works, is an OBE.

Labour MP John Mann said the award to Mr Carbosiero took ‘cronyism to a different level’.

He said: ‘It devalues the honours system. Anyone who the Prime Minister knows gets an honour.’

Fellow Labour MP John Ashworth said: ‘He deserves a gong – after all, it’s a tall order to make him [Mr Cameron] look good.’

A Downing Street spokesman said: ‘All honours decisions are awarded entirely on merit and decided by independent committee.’
