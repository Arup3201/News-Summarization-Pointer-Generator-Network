QPR have released Aaron Hughes, Stephane Mbia and Andrew Johnson at the end of their contracts, but are in talks with goalkeeper Rob Green and striker Bobby Zamora over possible new deals.

The west London club are preparing for life back in the Barclays Premier League, secured by a dramatic late winner in the play-off final at Wembley from Zamora.

As well as confirming the release of former England defender Luke Young, Benoit Assou-Ekotto, Ravel Morrison, Tom Carroll, Niko Kranjcar, Will Keane, Kevin Doyle and Modibo Maiga have all returned to their parent clubs following loan spells at Loftus Road.

However, Harry Redknapp’s squad could yet include the likes of Green and Zamora in the top flight again.

A statement on the QPR website read: 'The club can confirm it is in preliminary discussions with Rob Green, Armand Traore, Alejandro Faurlin, Gary O’Neil and Bobby Zamora regarding their futures, although at this stage no deals have been finalised.

'Jermaine Jenas is currently recovering from an ACL injury and will continue his rehabilitation at Harlington in the short-term.'
