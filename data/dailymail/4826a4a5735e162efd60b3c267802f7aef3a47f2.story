On trial: Conrad Murray, pictured here in February, was in court today

A 12-member jury has been chosen for the trial of Michael Jackson's
personal physician Dr Conrad Murray.

Seven men and five women were selected after a process that involved completing a 30-page questionnaire about Jackson and the media coverage of his death in June 2009 in Los Angeles.

A pool of 84 potential jurors began yesterday although 10 were soon dismissed for hardship reasons and 16 others who were taken off the panel through attorneys' challenges.

With 27 prospective panellists in or near the jury box at a time, defense attorney Edward Chernoff asked them if they could honestly say they had never read, heard or seen anything about Jackson's lifestyle, family or personality, or about his own client, Dr. Conrad Murray.

None raised their hands.

Deputy District Attorney David Walgren asked one of the potential jurors why she had put an exclamation mark on her jury questionnaire.

She had responded: 'No!' to a question about whether she had seen This Is It, the documentary made from rehearsal footage of the singer in the days before his death from propofol intoxication on June 25, 2009, at the age of 50.'That was an emphatic no,' she responded. 'I wasn't interested.'

Sixteen of the first batch of potential jurors were dismissed in rapid fashion after attorneys from both sides used eight peremptory challenges each to excuse those they did not want on the trial.

Attorneys on each side had 10 peremptory challenges, meaning each side had two left heading into the afternoon court session.

Dr Conrad Murray has pleaded not guilty to charges of involuntary manslaughter. The trial is due to start on Tuesday.

Prosecutors say Dr Murray caused the pop star's death by giving him a powerful anaesthetic, propofol, to help him sleep. He faces up to four years in prison if convicted.

He has been free on $75,000 bail since being charged in February 2010.

The jurors were selected yesterday after less than six hours of questioning by Superior Court Judge Michael Pastor and lawyers for the defence and prosecution.

Half of the chosen panelists are Caucasian, five are Hispanic and one is African-American.

The jurors have a wide range of professions, including a bus driver, paralegal and a bookseller.

The final selection came after weeks of close scrutiny of all the candidates.
