A 300lb gingerbread replica of the White House was the centrepiece of the White House Christmas decorations, unveiled today by Michelle Obama.

The impressive structure, which features a marzipan version of the kitchen garden and an oversized model of First Dog Bo, was pride of place in the the State Dining Room.

The First Lady, who was dressed in gold Michael Kors, presented this year's decorations before an 
appreciative crowd of military families Wednesday, then spent some time 
doing holiday crafts with military kids.

One of your five-a-day? The structure even features a marzipan version of Michelle's kitchen garden

The theme for this year's decorations is 'Joy to All,' but first dog Bo seems to steals the show.

There are 40 'Bo-flake' ornaments throughout the White House that feature cutout images of the dog.

There's a life-size replica of the dog, with a string of lights in his mouth, in the East Garden Room.

And there's an outsized statue of the Portuguese water dog next to the 300-pound gingerbread house in the State Dining Room.

Icing on the cake: The incredible detail of the gingerbread house can be seen in a Twitter picture posted by the Daily Beast's Robin Givhan. Even the windows are glossy to resemble glass

Mrs Obama said that reflects Bo's high standing at the White House.

'He's almost as big as the house,' she declared. 'He is such a huge personality.'

Visitors also will get a Bo bookmark that sends them on a scavenger hunt for 'Bo-ornaments' stashed in eight rooms.

Bo himself made an appearance during Wednesday's festivities, sporting a
jingle bell collar, and was quickly swarmed by young guests.

This year's decorations include lots of handmade items that could easily
be done at home, including patriotic wreaths and ornaments wrapped in 
red, white and blue yarn to fit with Mrs. Obama's emphasis on supporting
military families.

The gargantuan gingerbread house, however, is not a feat for amateurs to
attempt: It contains more than 175 pounds of gingerbread and modified 
gingerbread and more than 50 pounds of chocolate.

Pastry chef Bill 
Yosses mixed up a combination of wheat, rye and white-flour gingerbread 
that mimics the color of the sandstone house prior to 1798, when the 
house was first painted white.

Main attraction: The official White House Christmas tree, an 18ft 6in Frasier fur from Jefferson, North Carolina, trimmed with ornaments decorated by children of military families

More than 90,000 visitors are expected to pass through the White House this holiday season.

Executive chef Cristeta Comerford said she's drawing on the recipes in 
Mrs. Obama's gardening book, American Grown, as she prepares food for 
all the guests.

The treats will include sweet potato quick bread, green 
beans with almonds and a winter salad featuring fennel.

Ta-da! The First Lady seemed delighted with her efforts

Taste test: The First Lady also made time to sample her handiwork

Season's greetings: Mrs Obama said that the theme for this year's decorations was Joy to All

The massive decorating job - there are 54 live Christmas trees in the 
White House - comes together in just five days, with the help of 85 
volunteers from around the country.

This year's volunteers included 
Nellie Funk, a military wife from Carlisle, Pa., who was working beside 
retired homicide detective Tracy Jacobson from Southern California.

Asked which job was more fun - detective or decorator - Jacobson deadpanned: 'This has been much more fun.'
