The police are 'frantically ringing around' victims of abuse at the hands of Jimmy Savile in a bid to reassure them their identities will not be revealed by Operation Yewtree detective now going on Big Brother, a source has said.

Detectives from Operation Yewtree were today contacting anyone who were interviewed by ex-detective constable Dan Neal, who entered the show last night.

The former policeman tried to avoid discussing his law enforcement career during his first night in the house, describing himself as 'unemployed' and telling host Emma Willis he was looking for a 'change' in his life'.

'I'd done ten and a half years in the police and I've worked really hard and achieved a lot,' he said. 'I just need a change. I wanted to explore the creative side of my personality.'

Yesterday lawyer Liz Dux, head of the
abuse department of Slater&Gordon which represents 62 alleged 
victims of Britain's most prolific paedophile, said: 'This is extremely 
traumatic for some of the victims.

'They have poured their hearts out to this detective - some of them disclosing details which they haven't yet told their family.

'Now they fear that him appearing on Big Brother will mean that some highly confidential information will be revealed.

'It's
not just the fear of what might come out on nation television, it's 
also the fear of what this detective might be telling other housemates 
when the cameras are not on him which is giving them such torment.

'We
know the format of this show involves giving contestants copious 
amounts of alcohol, we just don't know what information he might divulge
during the programme.'

She added: 'Channel 5 have been incredibly irresponsible adding this former detective to the Big Brother house.

'They
must have known it was likely to cause distress for victims. But I can 
only imagine they thought his appearance would be good for the show's 
publicity.

'Why else would he have been selected for the show if not to talk about all the salacious details of the Savile investigation?

'When the victims gave their 
statements to police, they hoped for closure to an extremely distressing
period of their lives. Seeing Mr Neal on Big Brother has reopened this 
wound. We hoped Operation Yewtree would give victims the confidence to 
come forward, but this publicity stunt risks undermining that work.'

Bosses at Scotland Yard are said to be 
at furious former detective constable's decision to seek celebrity status on the back of 
Britain's biggest sexual abuse investigation.

Concerns: A Scotland Yard child abuse detective who worked on Operation Yewtree will enter the Big Brother House, probably on Friday

They have raised concerns his appearance on the show could compromise Operation Yewtree.

And to highlight the level of concern
felt among top brass at Scotland Yard, detectives are currently calling
every alleged victim who has had contact with Mr Neal to offer 
reassurance.

A Met Police spokesman said: 'Victims remain our priority.

'We are endeavouring to make contact with individuals who may have had face to face contact with the officer.'

Channel 5 refused to be drawn on criticism levelled at the programme.

A spokesman said: 'Channel 5 takes 
its obligations as a broadcaster seriously and, as has been made clear 
to New Scotland Yard, extensive procedures are in place to ensure that 
nothing will be broadcast during the course of Big Brother which would 
involve the former police officer breaching confidentiality, invading 
the privacy of others, committing libel or a contempt of Court.'

Until recently, the gay father-of-one, 33, had been hunting celebrities who may also have carried out sex
attacks, either with the help of paedophile Savile or working alone.

But he is expected to be one of the show's most controversial contestants when he enters the house tonight.

'I think there will be some concern within the force', he told the Daily Express.

Mr Neal, from
Ongar, Essex, said that he did not want to jeopardise a case he had 
worked on during the past eight months, adding: 'I can't talk about the 
content of the investigation but there may be a few concerned faces 
within my old department.'

Paedophile: Operation Yewtree was launched after Jimmy Savile's decades of sexual abuse were uncovered, which the officer reportedly told BB producers was 'upsetting' and 'draining'

A Met Police spokesman said: 'We are aware of reports concerning the proposed media appearance of a former detective constable.

'We've
been in contact with Channel 5 and made them fully aware of potential 
risks and their responsibility to live investigations.

'All officers joining and leaving the Met are required to sign the Official Secrets Act.'

It is unclear if the former detective applied to be a contestant on the
reality TV show while working for the Metropolitan Police.

But it is understood Mr Neal quit his job last month and auditions for the reality show opened in January.

Arrested stars include Jim Davidson, Rolf Harris, DJ Dave Lee Travis,
Freddie Starr, and Gary Glitter. They all deny the allegations.

Big Brother 2013 launches tonight on Channel 5 with a 'secrets and lies' theme, which includes a prison inside the house.

His decision to become a reality star will shock Scotland Yard and producers
have said the child abuse expert has told them how life working on Yewtree and
its 400 lines of inquiry was 'upsetting' and 'draining'.

A show insider said the officer knows the confidential nature of his work
but understands 'it is only natural' that other contestants will try to get 'as much
gossip as possible' about the investigation.

Mr Neal also spoke about the hours he
spent sifting through evidence linked to Savile's decades of sexual abuse.

He also said he worked in a specialist team of 30 officers and was pleased
they had been able to make a difference to victims.

'The housemate knows they are going to hit the headlines over this. Leaving
the police force to go into the Big Brother house is a massive move,' a show
insider told the Daily Star.

'Their former bosses are going to be shocked about their decision to join
the show and naturally will be worried about what might be said inside the
house.

'This person has seen a lot of bad things while working on Operation
Yewtree. They will know what can and can’t be said inside the house but it’s
only natural for their housemates to want to try to get as much gossip as
possible.'

Channel 5 sought to allay fears something broadcast on Big Brother could compromise the on-going investigation.

A
spokesman said: 'Extensive procedures are in place to ensure nothing 
will be broadcast with which would involve the former police officer 
breaching confidentiality, committing libel or a contempt of court.'

New pictures released this week revealed the house the new set of contestants will live in for the 
duration of this year's show.

Ready for action: The theme this year is Secret & Lies and the house is decked out with numerous secret rooms - including a prison

Not long now: This year will see Emma Willis take over the main hosting duties to replace Brian Dowling, but will the police officer keep quiet about his work at the Met

Not only have producers added an 
outdoor shower, no doubt in the hope to get some steamy viewing action, 
but they've also included a snug treehouse in the garden.

Its addition is no doubt put in place in a bid to encourage housemates to get some privacy away from the main building.

Other
features include an outside shower, a 'prison' for any bad behaving 
contestants and an electricity generating bike in the bedroom.

Arrests: Comedian Jimmy Tarbuck and Australian entertainer Rolf Harris have also been held by Yewtree
