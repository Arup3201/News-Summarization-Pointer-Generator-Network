A stranded cargo ship carrying 1,200 luxury cars has refloated itself on a high tide just hours after a previous salvage mission failed.

The 51,000-tonne Hoegh Osaka was grounded deliberately on a sandbar as it left Southampton on Saturday night after it started listing dangerously in a busy shipping lane with 25 crew aboard.

A plan to re-float it today costing a reputed £10million had to be abandoned amid warnings of poor weather - but at lunchtime today it began to drift of its own accord, sparking frantic attempts to tow it to a more stable position in the Solent.

Towed to safety: The 51,000-tonne Hoegh Osaka was pulled through the Solent by two tugs as it refloated itself on high tide today

Frantic effort: Still listing at a perilous 52 degrees, the ship had begun to drift despite a salvage attempt today having to be called off

Still listing 52 degrees, the ship was towed out into the mouth of Southampton Water by two tugs this afternoon and into the neighbouring port, to the bemusement of locals and holidaymakers heading to the Isle of Wight.

A spokesman for Svitzer, the firm leading the salvaging operation, said: 'She appears to have come adrift herself on the high tide.

'They are rushing down there to take advantage of it and hopefully get control of her movements. They are going to see if they can stabilise her and get her off the bank and into safe waters in the Solent.'

Solent Coastguard said it found out the ship was floating when salvage workers raised the alarm while still on board. 

A Maritime and Coastguard Agency spokesman added: 'The ship self floated at 1.55pm and all salvors had left the vessel safely.

'The list of the ship is unchanged and the vessel is under tow to a preferred holding position two miles east of the original grounding position.'

The ship was moved to Alpha Anchorage, a point in the Solent just outside Portsmouth Harbour, after the MCA originally said it would be held inside the harbour itself.

An existing 200-metre exclusion zone was extended to 500 metres as the ship moved at a speed of around two knots.

Valuable: The ship was carrying 1,400 vehicles including Jaguars, Minis, Land Rovers, JCBs and Rolls Royce Wraith worth £260,000

Safety: The ship being towed at a speed of two knots this afternoon. A new 300-metre exclusion zone was set to be established

A new 300-metre exclusion zone will be established around the vessel while the damage is assessed. Salvage teams say it may have taken on a substantial amount of water which will need pumping out.

The car transporter was originally to be towed to Southampton but at 4.30pm the Maritime and Coastguard Agency announced a change of plan.

It was carrying around 1,400 vehicles including 1,200 Jaguars and Land Rovers, 65 Minis, 105 pieces of JCB construction equipment and a Rolls Royce Wraith worth an estimated £260,000.

All were destined for the Middle East, and the ship was sailing for Bremerhaven in Germany when it ran aground at 9.20pm on Saturday.

As the ship tilted at 45 degrees, a dramatic air and sea rescue operation was launched which lasted several hours and resulted in 23 crew and the pilot being successfully winched from the ship.

A 24th crew member was plucked from the water by lifeboat crews after he jumped from the low side of the ship and suffered a broken leg.

Its owners Hoegh Autoliners said the 590ft-long ship had to be grounded deliberately on the Bramble Bank sandbar after it started listing dangerously. They are still investigating what caused it to tilt.

Chief executive Ingar Skiaker said: 'The pilot and the master took the decision to save the vessel and its crew by grounding her on the bank. This showed great skill and seamanship on behalf of our crew when faced with such challenging circumstances.

'At this stage it is too early to speculate on the cause of the list but we are starting an immediate investigation. An investigation is ongoing as to what occurred last night and that is being conducted by the MAIB.

'Our chief concern now is to ensure there is no environmental damage from this incident. There is no oil spill reported at this point, however we understand that the UK authorities have brought their spill response to a state of active readiness.' 

The ship's 500 tonnes of fuel were kept on board to prevent any leakage while attempting to move it.

Stronger winds today may also have played a part in the ship shifting.

At midday, wind speeds reached 25mph with gusts of 37mph before peaking at around 1pm with 28mph winds and gusts of 37mph.

It was revealed yesterday that water had seeped into the ship after a digger it was carrying came loose and smashed into the hull, puncturing it. That damage has now been fixed.

But the MCA said the water let in would need to be removed prior to a refloating and this would take too long to carry out before the weather window for the operation closes, with stronger winds forecast for the coming days.

They had instead intended to anchor the ship down to prevent it from moving so it could up put upright and refloated on a future date. 

Bramble Bank is a well-known sandbar in Southampton Water, and is the scene of an annual cricket match between two yachting clubs when the sands are exposed in low spring tides.

In November 2008, the Cunard liner Queen Elizabeth 2 with 1,700 passengers on board ran aground on Bramble Bank but was able to continue its journey on the rising tide after four tugs pulled it clear.
