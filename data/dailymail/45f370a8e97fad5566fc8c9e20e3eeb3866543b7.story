The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) is investigating the controversial launch of a new Thermomix kitchen appliance, according to emails seen by Daily Mail Australia.

The surprise release of the Thermomix TM5 last month - the first of its kind in seven years - was controversial with customers who had recently forked out $1939 for an older model. Many said they were told there was no new product forthcoming.

On Friday, several customers who brought the matter to the ACCC received messages from the watchdog saying it was 'engaging with Thermomix' to determine if the company had breached consumer protection laws.

Several Thermomix customers received messages from the ACCC last week saying the commission was trying to establish whether a breach of the Australian Consumer Law had occurred

'We are aware of the concerns you and other consumers have raised regarding the release of the new Thermomix model,' the emails said.

'We are currently engaging with Thermomix to address these concerns and establish whether a breach of the Australian Consumer Law has occurred.' 

More than 2500 people signed a Change.org petition calling for Thermomix to address the issue.

One recipient of the message, Perth customer Lea Fowler, 57, told Daily Mail Australia she had never seen such a backlash from ordinary mums.

When Ms Fowler purchased two Thermomix TM31 products in August - one for herself, another for a friend - she said she was told there was no new model coming out.

But the company announced the release of the TM5 on its Australian Facebook page within a month, on September 6.

'I just feel this shouldn't happen to genuine customers that ask the right questions that go into buying a quite expensive machine a lot of us have thought a long time about,' Ms Fowler said.

'I've never seen such a backlash from ordinary mums out there in Australia who have saved hard to buy this machine and they felt really ripped off.' 

The old model is now readily available on eBay and Gumtree priced around $1500. 

Brisbane customer Georgina Shelley, an administrator of the Thermomix Unhappy Customers Facebook page, also received the message on Friday.  

She said the group was waiting with 'bated breath' for a positive response from the ACCC.

'We can speculate whether the company has broken consumer law, (but) we can't say for the sure until we get some response from the ACCC.' 

The latest development comes after consumer group CHOICE presented Thermomix with a 'Shonky' Award over the brouhaha last week. 

We are aware of the concerns you and other consumers have raised regarding the release of the new Thermomix model. 

We are currently engaging with Thermomix to address these concerns and establish whether a breach of the Australian Consumer Law has occurred. 

The Australian Consumer Law prohibits businesses from misleading consumers. Businesses can mislead consumers by not telling them something. 

Doing so might be illegal when:

- one person fails to alert another to facts only known to them, and this information is relevant to the decision being made by the consumer

- important details that a person should know are not explained to them 

- a change in circumstance before the consumer makes the decision means information already provided is incorrect 

If you are seeking an individual remedy you should write to Thermomix to try to resolve this problem. 

If that does not work you should consider getting independent legal advice about what options are available to suit your situation. You may also be entitled to take your complaint to your local state and territory small claims court or tribunal. 

The Thermomix is also popular internationally

CHOICE is calling for customers who purchased an older model Thermomix three months prior to the TM5's release to be given a choice of a full refund, a $250 discount, or an upgrade to the TM5 for $50. 

Mr Godfrey said the watchdog 'welcomed' news of the ACCC's involvement, saying the company has only offered a discount or upgrade to customers who paid for their Thermomix TM31 after August 20.

'The company has sweetened the deal for those who purchased their models after July 1 by offering them a free blade, bowl and lid set,' he said.

'This isn't good enough and will be joining consumers in calling on the ACCC to look into this issue further.' 

He told Daily Mail Australia ACCC action is important 'to ensure that this behaviour doesn't set a precedent in the way other companies behave.'

According to a company advertisement - set to dramatic music - the TM5 has 10 per cent more capacity than previous models, featured a new measuring cup and a more powerful and quieter motor. Thermomix did not immediately respond to Daily Mail Australia's requests for comment on Monday. 

The ACCC also refused to comment. Last week a spokesman told Daily Mail Australia the agency is 'limited in its capacity to discuss matters under potential investigation'.
