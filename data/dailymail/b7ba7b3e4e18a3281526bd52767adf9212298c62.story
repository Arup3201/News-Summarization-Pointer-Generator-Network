If you’ve ever posted a tweet full of typos, or realised you’ve included the wrong person in a conversation, you may soon be able to save face by editing the post. 

According to news site The Desk, Twitter is working on a feature that would let users modify previously posted tweets without having to delete them and repost. 

The editing feature would only be available on tweets for a short period of time, and the reports claim tweets can only be changed once.

Twitter is said to be working on a feature that would let users make 'small changes' to tweets, such as correcting typos, but the feature would only be enabled for a short period of time. An algorithm could also prevent people from being able to change the 'overall intention' of the tweet

Facebook unveiled an editing feature in September that lets users change posts after they’ve been sent.

Security experts criticised the plans
 because other Facebook users who had interacted with the post would not
 be notified.

However, a history of edits is available and that particular post is marked as 'edited.'

This would be to avoid users spamming each other or removing information from a tweet that could be used in legal proceedings, for example. 

Similarly, if a tweet with a link to a news story is getting a lot of retweets, this limited time feature will prevent a brand changing this link to a promotion or product later on. 

It is likely users will only be able to make ‘small changes’ to the tweet, such as correcting a single typo, or changing one or two words. 

They will not be able to change the ‘overall intention’ of a tweet, and it is thought Twitter is working on an algorithm that could determine if this intention has changed.

Any changes made to a tweet would then appear in posts that are retweeted, using the Retweet button, but not in tweets where another user has quoted the original.

Sources claim the feature is still in development, but is likely to be ready in 'weeks, or months at the most.' The feature could be especially useful for people who tweet from mobile phones or tablets due to mistakes made because of autocorrect tools and smaller touchscreen keyboards

Sources, quoted only as ‘Twitter employees’, claim this algorithm is still in development but is likely to be ready in ‘weeks, or months at the most.’

The feature could be especially useful 
for people who tweet from their mobile phones or tablets due to mistakes made 
because of autocorrect tools and smaller touchscreen keyboards.

Facebook unveiled a similar editing feature in September that lets users change posts after they’ve been sent.

Security experts criticised the plans because other Facebook users who had interacted with the post are not be notified, although a history of edits is available. That particular post is also marked as ‘edited.’ 

Google’s Gmail similarly has a hidden feature that lets users unsend emails within a 30 second window, in case the email was sent to the wrong person, or contained errors.

The feature can be found in the Settings tab.
