Nicholas Totty, was sentenced to life in prison after pleading guilty to four rapes during a four-hour rampage through Rotherham

A drug-crazed bodybuilder armed with knives violently raped a woman in the street and a teenager three times in her own home after he smashed his way in.

Former Royal Navy chef Nicholas Totty, 25, was jailed for life with a minimum term of 10 years following his four-hour rampage in the Rotherham area of South Yorkshire.

A mother was forced to watch her daughter being raped three times by Totty and another woman only escaped a sex attack because her dog frightened him off.

Sheffield Crown Court heard powerfully-built 18-stone Totty, who is 6ft 4 inches, was hooked on anabolic steroids and was discharged from the Navy in 2010 for using the drugs.

Andrew Dallas, prosecuting, said Totty had a girlfriend but had several other affairs. The court heard he had a high sex drive and indulged in violent sexual role plays with women.

His rampage began at 9.15pm on Friday, September 27 when he tried to sexually attack a 24-year-old woman as she walked her dog on a footpath alongside a main road in Rotherham.

Totty cycled up in front of her and waited in the shadows until he pounced on her with his arm outstretched trying to grab her neck.

He made three grabs for her but her dog intervened and jumped up, forcing him to flee. The victim recognised him as someone she knew from school.

Totty then went home to check his Facebook but was out on the streets by 11.15pm where he banged on a steelworker’s door hoping to find a woman but made a story up about asking directions.

A few minutes later he accosted a 27-year-old woman who was eight months pregnant in the street as she walked home from the town’s railway station.

He shone a torch in her face before hitting her with it on the head and pushing her to the ground.

He told her if she shouted out he would slit her throat with a chef’s knife and then forced her to twice perform a sex act.

He produced some kitchen roll out of a carrier bag which he used to wipe her head wound in a bid to get rid of any evidence.

Totty forced his way into the home of a mother and daughter, raping the girl three times while forcing her mother to watch. He also forced a woman who was eight months pregnant to perform a sex act on him while he threatened her with a knife. File picture

After she ran away he caught up with her and ripped off her trousers and underwear but a passing motorist heard the woman’s screams and Totty ran off, leaving a second knife on the ground.

Mr Dallas said Totty then tried to get into the home of a woman with whom he had a previous sexual relationship but she slammed the door in his face.

The worst attack was on a mother, 46, and her teenage daugher who were at home alone in bed at 12.45am.

The mother had lost her husband only weeks before and it is thought Totty may have known he would find her and her daughter alone as he knew the teenager’s relative.

Totty smashed his way into the house through the front and inside doors and as the mother dialled 999 he raced upstairs.

He pushed them both onto the floor and threatened to kill them before dragging them both by their hair to the bathroom.

He forced the teenager to perform a sex act before raping her three times.

When her mother tried to intervene, Totty knocked her to the floor and stamped on her face and neck.

Totty then suddenly changed and 'became sympathetic' when the mother spoke of her husband’s death. He ran off leaving their mobile phones in the garden.

He was arrested three days later after a massive police hunt.

Totty, of Whiston, near Rotherham, who lived with his mother and stepfather, admitted four rapes, assault with intent to commit a sexual offence, wounding with intent and attempting to cause grievous bodily harm with intent.

Dermot Hughes, defending, said: 'For the physical and emotional destruction he caused during that rampage he is truly sorry.'

'He wished to address the underlying causes of his offending inside jail and his behaviour was very much out of character.

'He is physically fit, mentally able and could have led a fulfilling and rewarding life,' he said.

The judge Mr Justice Globe said of the sex attack on the 27-year-old: 'It was a horrific, life-changing experience for her and his first victim was only saved from a serious sex attack by her dog.'

He said the women targeted in their home would have been dwarfed by his large frame and had now been forced to change address.

'Both were left with deep emotional and mental scars and can’t stop thinking about the events and are worried about their safety in the sanctity of their own home,' he said.

'The daughter fears she will be condemned to a lifetime of worry, fear and anxiety.'

The judge said a psychiatric report showed Totty had claimed he was hearing voices and thought people were plotting against him but it was all part of him trying to take control of his life as the motive for his offending was 'all linked to your heavy and persistent use of drugs.'

There was evidence he had a significant personality disorder and was of a psychopathic disposition, presenting a clear risk to the public which was why he was being given a life sentence.

'There is a clear risk of further random violent sexual crimes,' said the judge.

Totty’s victims along with family members packed the public gallery and one woman applauded as he received his sentence.
