An American Airlines pilot was forced to make an emergency landing after a passenger refused to stop singing Whitney Houston's hit song I Will Always Love You.

The solo performance began shortly into the flight from Los Angeles to New York and her crooning quickly became too much for passengers and staff on the domestic flight last Thursday.

The pilot was forced to change course halfway through the six hour flight and make an unscheduled stop at Kansas City so officers could escort the woman from the plane.

We have a Whitney Houston problem: Police officers board the American Airlines plane to escort a woman off a flight from LA to New York after she refused to stop singing I Will Always Love You

Arrested: The singer can just about be made out in a pink hat as police officers place her in handcuffs

Airport spokesman Joe McBride told WBTV: 'The woman was being disruptive and was removed from the plane for interfering with the flight crew.

'There was a federal air marshal on the aircraft, who subdued the woman and put her in cuffs and removed her from the plane.'

Despite staff telling passengers they could not take photographs while on board the aircraft, one managed to briefly film the woman being escorted down the aircraft's aisle in handcuffs - still singing the 1990s pop song.

The woman was interviewed and later released without charge.

While the song she chose to entertain 
her fellow passengers with is best known for Whitney Houston's cover in 
the film The Bodyguard, it was originally released by country 
singer-songwriter Dolly Parton in 1974.

Too much of a good thing: Fellow passengers could no longer cope with her repeated renditions of the hit song from the film The Bodyguard

The original I Will Always Love You received positive comments from critics and reached number one on the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart two times.

This made Parton the first artist 
ever to earn a number one record twice with the same song as a singer, 
and three times as a writer.

But
 it was not until Houston's cover of I Will Always Love You in The 
Bodyguard movie that the song became an international hit.

The
 Bodyguard's original soundtrack won the 1994 Grammy Award for Album of 
the Year and I Will Always Love You became the best-selling single by a 
female artist in music history.

Houston
 became the first act - solo or group, male or female - to sell more 
than a million copies of an album within a single week period under 
Nielsen SoundScan system.

The album makes her the top female act in the top 10 list of the best-selling albums of all time, at number four.

Houston went on to star in more movies and contribute to their soundtracks but The Bodyguard and I Will Always Love You remained one of the biggest successes of her career.

Houston was found dead in her guest room at The Beverly Hilton, in Beverly Hills, California, on February 11, 2012.

The official coroner's report showed that she had accidentally drowned in the bathtub, with heart disease and cocaine use listed as contributing factors.
