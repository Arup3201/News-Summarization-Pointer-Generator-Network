David Cameron today admitted the Tories have more to do to defeat UKIP, despite romping home to victory in the Newark by-election.

The Prime Minister warned the Conservatives 'the job isn't finished yet' on hammering home key messages on the economy, tax cuts and jobs. 

Tory candidate Robert Jenrick held on to the Nottinghamshire seat with a majority of 7,403, halting the march of UKIP's People's Army which Nigel Farage had boasted was on the verge of securing its first MP.

The result is a setback for UKIP leader Nigel Farage who hoped to secure the party's first seat in the Commons

David Cameron, attending D-Day commemorations in Bayeux with his wife Samantha, said the result in Newark showed the Conservatives still had more to do to win the argument over UKIP

The Conservatives secured a majority of more than 7,000 over UKIP, down from 16,000 in 2010

Mr Jenrick attracted 17,431 votes - a comfortable majority over Ukip's Roger Helmer, who received 10,028.

Labour's Michael Payne was pushed into third place with 6,842 votes, ahead of independent candidate Paul Stephen Baggaley, who finished with 1,891, and the Green Party's David Kirwan who attracted 1,037 votes.

It was a disastrous night for the Liberal Democrats however, whose candidate David Watts was beaten into a humiliating sixth place, barely scraping 1,000 votes.

The contest was triggered by the resignation of disgraced former MP Patrick Mercer, and had been seen as a crucial test of Nigel Farage’s ability to secure an historic first UKIP MP in the Commons. 

However the Tory majority was more than halved from 16,000 in 2010, with Ukip surging from a distant fifth place in that election, taking an additional 10,000 votes this time around.

Downing Street will hope that the result will quell fears on the Tory backbenches that the party can hold back the UKIP tide at the general election in May 2015. 

But speaking in Bayeux ahead of D-Day commemoration events, Mr Cameron said more had to be done to tackle the threat from UKIP in the run-up to the 2015 general election. 

He told reporters: 'We need to work between now and the next election to say very clearly we have got a long-term plan, we are getting Britain back to work, we are cutting people's taxes, we are helping hard-working people.

'The job isn't finished yet but we are on the right track, let's stick at it.'

UKIP secured a swing of 22.1 per cent, with the Lib Dems down 17.4 per cent on another dreadful night for Nick Clegg's party

New MP Mr Jenrick said: 'The people of Newark have voted to back this Government, to back this Government's long- term economic plan to secure the future of this constituency and of this great country.'

Mr Farage sought to put a brave face on the Tory victory, insisting UKIP had made 'huge gains'.

Speaking after the result, Mr Farage said: 'I think there'll be an awful lot of Conservatives with a majority of less than 10,000 who will look upon this result in sheer horror.'

But he admitted he would have liked to have done better in Newark.

'Yes, I mean the majority's halved and we thought we'd bitten into it even more than that, but nonetheless for U it's still a good night's work,' he said.

Denying he should have spent more time in the constituency, he said: ‘UKIP is about much more than Nigel Farage.’ 

Mr Cameron made four visits to the seat, including a tour with Boris Johnson, in an attempt to seal victory. By contrast Mr Farage visited just once during the campaign.

The Tories flooded the constituency with activists and MPs to prove the party machine could see off the threat from UKIP

The result will be a setback for Mr Farage, who had hoped to use victory in the European Parliament elections last month as a springboard to gaining a seat in Westminster.

He promised to do ‘everything we can’ to win the by-election, declaring: ‘The people’s army of Ukip now marches on Newark.’

However, on the eve of the vote the UKIP leader was pictured partying in Malta after giving a speech to the tourism industry. 

The by-election was triggered by the resignation of disgraced MP Patrick Mercer, who faced being suspended from the Commons after being caught in a lobbying sting

It suggested he had all but given up hope of seizing the Tories’ 44th safest seat.

Yesterday he was pictured walking hand-in-hand into a hotel with a tourism executive but he insisted today: 'I didn't go to bed with her'.

The UKIP leader claimed he was the victim of 'abhorrent mischief making' after he was photographed with Ande Soteri at 3.42am after a gala dinner in Malta.

UKIP strategists hoped to use Newark to mimic the success of the Reform party in Canada which used a by-election as a springboard to becoming a dominant political force.

Local teacher Deborah Grey won Reform's first seat in Parliament in 1989, and four years later the party overtook the Progressive Conservatives as the main right-wing party 

Mr Farage was accused of ‘bottling it’ after refusing to stand in the by-election himself, claiming he did not want to cause a ‘huge distraction’ from the Euro election campaign. He reportedly told the BBC that if he lost Ukip would be finished: 'The bubble is burst.'

He stepped aside in favour of Roger Helmer, who was elected as an MEP for UKIP last month. Many Tories despaired when the contest was called after Mr Mercer’s sudden resignation. 

The outspoken critic of Mr Cameron quit the Tory party in July last year after he was exposed as having accepted £4,000 to ask Parliamentary questions and lobby on behalf of Fiji. 

He referred himself to Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards and promised to quit the Commons at the next election. 

But in April it emerged the standards watchdog was going to recommend he be suspended from the Commons for six months, so he fell on his sword. 

The former Army colonel said that as an ex-soldier he believes that when you have done something wrong you should confess to it. 

He added: ‘No point in shilly- shallying or trying to avoid it. What has happened has happened, I’m ashamed of it. Therefore, I’m going to do what I can to put it right . . . I’m going to resign my seat.’  

The market town of Newark lies on the River Trent in Nottinghamshire has been held by the Tories since 2001

Newark is a largely rural constituency which, since Patrick Mercer was elected in 2001, has been considered a safe Conservative seat.

Centred on the affluent cathedral town of Southwell and the market town of Newark, and dissected by the River Trent, around half of the area's 72,000 voters live in villages and rural areas.

It borders Labour-held Bassetlaw in the north and lies to the north east of a number of Labour-voting constituencies in the city of Nottingham.

But unlike Nottinghamshire's more urban areas, Newark has a traditionally Conservative-voting population, like that of its two neighbouring Lincolnshire constituencies, Gainsborough and Sleaford and North Hykeham, which border it to the east.

Newark's electorate is 93 per cent white British, and 67 per cent describe themselves as Christian, with less than one per cent considering themselves Hindu, Muslim, Sikh or Jewish.

More than 70 per cent of homes in the constituency either owned outright or mortgaged, less than 10 per cent of households have council or housing association tenants and only 20 per cent of the electorate are younger than 34.

Well over half of voters are employed, with nearly one in five retired and only three per cent unemployed.

Traditionally Tory, it was held by the party for the first half of the 20th century, but swung to Labour after the war, with Labour MPs George Deer and Edward Stanley Bishop representing it from 1950 to 1979.

It swung back to the Conservatives in 1979, with Tory Richard Alexander holding the seat until 1997, when Labour's Fiona Jones won a slim majority as Tony Blair swept to power.

Mrs Jones could only hold the seat for one term however and Mr Mercer won it back for the Tories in 2001.

At the last election, the Tories won 54 per cent of the vote, giving them a huge majority over Labour, who polled at only 24 per cent.
