If you ever endured a long car journey with your parents as a child, chances are you played I Spy to pass the time.

When the traffic grinds to a halt and the cries of ‘Are we there yet?’ begin, it is a surefire solution for frustrated parents.

But gadgets such as the iPad have now overtaken the traditional guessing game as a way to keep youngsters amused for hours on the road.

Gadgets such as the iPad have overtaken I Spy was a way to keep children entertained in car journeys

While nearly a third (30 per cent) of drivers said their parents played I Spy to keep them happy on long trips, only one in seven (14 per cent ) of current parents said they used the game to keep their own youngsters content, an AA/Populus survey reveals.

Parents now most often rely on electronic games or let children play on smartphones to keep them occupied, the poll found.

The AA stressed that keeping children entertained - whether by traditional or modern methods - was vital in the wake of earlier research which has shown that motorists are 12 times more likely to be distracted by their children than by talking on a mobile phone.

The latest AA research shows that of the 23,450 motorists surveyed, those in London and Northern Ireland were the least likely to entertain child passengers with traditional games like I Spy in which the first to spot a particular landmark or car is the winner. The game has even been turned into a successful series of books.

Giving children a DVD to watch was most popular among drivers from Scotland, north-east England and north-west England.

The AA also highlighted earlier statistics from academics which showed that children were 12 times more distracting than mobile phones to drivers.

The AA also pointed to the fact that drivers or riders ‘failing to look properly’ was the most commonly cited contributory factor in UK road accidents, while sudden braking, swerving and loss of control (14 per cent) were also all common contributory factors.

AA president Edmund King said: ‘Momentary distraction behind the wheel can be the difference between life and death.

‘Many
drivers do not consider children in the car as a potential distraction 
but taking your eyes off the road for just a few seconds to deal with 
what’s happening on the back seat can have dramatic consequences.’

He
added: ‘Keeping children entertained in the car is one of the best ways
to reduce the risk as they are less likely to be a distraction if they 
are occupied with a game.

‘But
traditional in-car entertainment has changed over the generations. "I 
Spy with my little eye" is being replaced by the iPad and electronic 
eyes as a tactic to keep modern children quiet on a long trip.’

The
findings come as Mr King, who is also a visiting professor of transport
at Newcastle University, addresses a seminar on driver distraction for 
the launch of national Road Safety Week.
