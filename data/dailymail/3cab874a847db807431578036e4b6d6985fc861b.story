A helpless horse was pulled from a raging river after a gruelling two hour fight for survival.

The 500lb wild filly was spotted struggling to stay upright in strong currents after getting trapped by boulders in Trout Creek in Summerland, British Columbia.

Theresa Nolet, 59, from Ontario, Canada, captured the amazing rescue on camera as volunteers, fire fighters and police officers attempted to pull the horse out of the cold water.

Theresa said: ‘It was a heart-stopper, that's for sure - seeing her slip out of the rope and slide down the river.

‘Just as we would get the rope around her, she would slip right out again.’

It took rescuers four attempts before successfully getting a rope around the horse's neck, allowing them to steadily bring her closer to shore.

Tricky operation: It took several attempts to get the rope around the horse's neck

Boulders in the water prevented the horse from climbing up onto land

Neigh trouble: A rescuer guides the horse out of the water

Calming measures: Rescuers placed a blanket over the horse's head

Success: The horse was eventually pull onto the river bank, where it lay down with exhaustion

But boulders in the water prevented the horse from climbing up onto land.

Theresa said: ‘The fire fighters moved some of the boulders that stood in her way, and then we laid plywood down to make it easier for her to slide out of the water.’

The horse was eventually guided out of the water, and covered with blankets to warm up.

Caring: Rescuers wrapped the horse in a blanket after its ordeal to keep it warm

The horse, later named Rivers, is now living with a foster family in Summerland.

Theresa, a gemologist, also runs O.A.T.S Horse Rescue with two other women.

She said: ‘We are not a registered charity, we do what we can when we can.

‘We're trying to resolve the issue of feral horses in the area.’
