Changes: Primary school children as young as five will be taught Shakespeare, it emerged today

Shakespeare will be taught to children as young as five because the Government wants the Bard's 'cultural legacy' taught across the majority of lessons, it was revealed today.

Primary school pupils will start to learn more about the playwright in maths, art and even food technology, Michael Gove will reveal today.

More of his plays and poetry will also be taught in traditional classes like English and drama.

As the curriculum is widened, youngsters will make meals enjoyed 450 years ago, like pea and bacon pottage, study statistics showing how people died at the time, draw portraits of Shakespeare and act out more of his plays.

The Education Secretary believes that it is crucial for children to learn more about Shakespeare and his work, even if they have just started school.

It came as it emerged teenagers studying for their GCSEs will have now have to read two of the Bard's plays to pass - when Labour previously only insisted on one.

The campaign to increase exposure to Shakespeare in schools has been launched in conjunction with the 450th anniversary of his birth next year, a celebration backed by Dame Judi Dench.

Mr Gove will speak as national Shakespeare Week starts today, saying the Government will 'bring Shakespeare's literary and 
cultural legacy to thousands more children'.

'Shakespeare's language is our language. It is our inheritance,' he will say.

'Through Shakespeare Week, many pupils will have the chance to share and enjoy this inheritance.'

Under the plans primary schools will be given access to new online resources, allowing them to plan Shakespeare-inspired lessons.

The aim is to put Britain's greatest poet and playwright at the very centre of the national curriculum, according to the Daily Telegraph.
