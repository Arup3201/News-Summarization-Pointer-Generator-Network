A Michigan senator admitted she was a rape victim Wednesday in a last ditch effort to stop a measure that would force women to buy additional insurance to cover abortions.

Despite Democractic Senator Gretchen Whitmer sharing her personal horror story, the  Senate and House ended up passing the measure into law yesterday. The Senate passed the measure on a 27-11 vote with a 62-47 vote in the House.

Now, when Michigan women find themselves in an unwanted pregnancy, insurance will not cover the costs of an abortion unless the woman invested in special coverage.

This time it's personal: Senator Gretchen Whitmer shared her personal story of being raped in college Wednesday as she tried to get a measure on abortion insurance put to public vote

Initially, Senator Minority Leader Whitmer tried to get a male colleague to share his story of how a planned pregnancy had to end in an abortion procedure.

But she realized she shouldn't force someone else to tell their emotional story if she wasn't brave enough to share her own.

Senator Whitmer spoke publicly for the first time about the rape she endured in college 20 years ago, a nightmare she hadn't even told her father about. 

'And thank god it didn't result in a pregnancy, because I can't imagine going through what I went through and then having to consider what to do about an unwanted pregnancy,' she said.

She goes on to explain that if the measure were law then and she become pregnant, she would have had to pay for an abortion out of pocket unless she 'thought ahead and planned for it'. Whitmer says she 'can't even imagine' what she would do if one of her own daughters went through the same horrifying experience. According to MIRS, she is married to Dr Marc Mallory, a Lansing dentist.

'I'm not the only woman in our state who has faced that horrible circumstance,' she said. 'I'm not enjoying talking about it. It's something I've hidden for a long time.'

Ms Whitmer was joined by other state representatives who shared their personal stories of abortion. They were trying to block the measure from becoming law without a state-wide vote first.

Democratic Representative Colleen Lamonte spoke about the dilation and curettage procedure she went through after a miscarriage.

'I would have been denied this procedure. Or we would have had an expensive medical bill that would have bankrupted us,' she said. 'This is an issue that should be openly debated. Please don't silence the voices of the people in our state.'

Lamonte and her husband Jeff have two children.

Vicki Barnett, the Democratic representative of Farmington Hills, said she underwent advanced fetal testing with her two children with husband Mark to make sure they didn't suffer from Tay-Sachs genetic disorder.

'Legislative Republicans are once again catering to the whims of special interest groups, and the citizens suffer,' Representative Barnett said in a statement. 'Now, Michigan women need to plan ahead for "rape insurance" in case the absolute worst happens.'
