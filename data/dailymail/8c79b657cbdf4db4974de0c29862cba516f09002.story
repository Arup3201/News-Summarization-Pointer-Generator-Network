Wheeler, who presided over Tower Hill's 750 pupils aged three to 18, turned himself into police in November 2013 after police asked for the public's help in finding him.

The unmarried teacher went missing the month before when he became the focus of a child sex abuse probe  linked to an incident more 30 years ago.

The investigation was prompted by allegations made by Pennsylvania man and his younger brother.

Police conducted a search of Wheeler's property for evidence of witness tampering or intimidation and instead found child pornography. 

They allegedly found some 2,000 explicit digital images of men engaged in sexual acts with young boys. 

In Monday's bench trial Wheeler was not charged with abusing anyone. 

Wheeler, whose adopted Russian son Nikolai is a professional golfer, was taken on by Tower Hill in 2004. 

Exclusive: Tower Hill School in Delaware, where tuition costs up to $26,955 a year, hired Wheeler in 2004

He had previously been assistant head of school and dean of admissions at Lake Forest Academy in Illinois and had held a post at St. Paul's School in Garden City, New York.

Tower Hill, whose alumni include TV personality Dr Oz and Senator Chris Coons, said that Wheeler was 'thoroughly vetted' before being hired.

The accomplished musician, composer and pilot, was paid more than $300,000 a year at the school, where tuition exceeds $26,000.
