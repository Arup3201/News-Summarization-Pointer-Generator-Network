One of the teenagers who had acid thrown on her in Zanzibar was told she had been given a place at university as she went into surgery for a skin graft this morning.

Kirstie Trup, 18, will be going to Bristol University to read history after receiving her A level results today, finding out inside the burns unit in Chelsea and Westminster hospital.

She and Katie Gee, also 18, were splashed with battery acid while volunteering on the Indian Ocean island off Africa, leaving them with burns on their faces, chests and hands.

Miss Gee also achieved the grades she needed to go to university, tweeting: 'On the plus side I'm off to Nottingham!", where she will do sociology.

Brave: Kirstie Trup, who was attacked in Zanzibar, received some good news today before she went into surgery for a skin graft, because she is off to university after getting good A-Level grades

Apprehension: Kirstie Trup, left, and Katie Gee, were flown home from the Indian Ocean island after the attack, and both will get exam results today like thousands of others

Miss Gee is about to undergo skin graft procedures at the Chelsea and Westminster as well.

Kirstie's family said today they received the news when the UCAS website indicated that she had been accepted by the university indicating that she had achieved the grades required.

Speaking from her bedside, her proud father Marc said: 'Kirstie got the good news before she went into theatre this morning.

Care: The two teenagers were both taken to Chelsea and Westminster Hospital after returning to the UK from Zanzibar on Friday

'Beyond imagination': The teenage girls were covered by sheets as they were escorted out of an ambulance and into the hospital

Attack: Two men on a moped hurled acid in the girls' faces as they walked to meet friends for dinner in Stone Town, Zanzibar (seen in a file photo)

'We haven't opened the letter with her results in yet, but Kirstie is very modest so I don't think she will want to tell the whole world if she has done well.

'We found out that she got a place to study History at Bristol University and will be starting in September, she will be very pleased.

'At the moment she is having an operation, a skin graft, and will probably be in hospital for a couple of days feeling a bit uncomfortable.

'At the moment my wife Rochelle and I are waiting for her to come out.

'She is incredibly positive, she is very strong, but we have never had any experience of this kind of thing before and nothing can prepare you for it.'

Bright spark: Kate Prescott, 18, from Swanmore, will be going to Cambridge University to study natural sciences after receiving six A*s this morning

Kate Prescott is celebrating getting six A*s in her A-levels and will now go to Cambridge University to study natural sciences.

The
18-year-old, from Swanmore in Hampshire, also scored three As in her 
AS-levels at state-run Peter Symonds' College in Winchester.

'I'm speechless really,' she said. 'I
guess I did work a little bit. Really, I did work really hard - I 
didn't have much spare time, but I have achieved what I wanted.

'I'm
surprised I have done so well because I had a lot of subjects, so, 
although I was predicted A*s, I could have slipped up with some of 
them.'

The keen sailor 
received the top grades at A-level in maths, further maths, chemistry, 
physics, general studies and the extended project. She got As at 
AS-level in biology, French and critical thinking.

'I don't think that A-levels are getting easier; perhaps people are just getting better,' she said.

'Everyone works very hard to do well.'

She will now go to Cambridge in the autumn and will not take a gap year.

'I think I want to go into science research of some sort but I don't know which science yet,' she added.

Meanwhile child genius Andrew Ejemai picked up an A* in his A-Level maths - at the age of 12.

Usain
Bolt fanatic Andrew proved he is as quick off the mark as his hero by 
acing the exam at Brentwood School, Essex, six years early.

Clever boy: 12-year-old Andrew Ejemai got an A* in A-Level maths at at Brentwood College, Essex

Brainbox Andrew was offered a place at prestigious Eton College after earning an A* in GCSE maths when he was just NINE.

After
collecting his result yesterday (Thursday), the wannabee computer 
engineer said: 'I started to enjoy maths when I was six or seven years 
old.

'I like solving equations and algebra and feel happy when I solve a hard question.'

Jon Williams, head of maths at Brentwood, said: 'Andrew is a very talented young man with an exceptional ability in Mathematics.

'To have completed his A Level by the age of 12 is impressive enough. To have achieved an A* grade is phenomenal.

'He is the most able student I have come across in 18 years of teaching.'
