An outdated three-reel slot machine is drawing in bigger crowds than a Celine Dion show at Las Vegas casino MGM Grand.

The Lion's Share has failed to produce a single jackpot in almost 20 years, and has attracted a legion of dedicated gamblers who believe it's going to pay out millions of dollars any day.

The Lion's Share is the lone survivor of a slew of $1 progressive slot machines from the early 1990s.

Growing daily: The Lion's Share and its ever-growing jackpot

According to Nevada law, slot machines are required to pay out 75 per cent of the money that goes in to them.

Therefore, the Lion's Share isn't going anywhere, at least not until somebody wins the jackpot.

The machine is the oldest three-reeled slot on the MGM gaming floor and has the highest level of 'occupancy,' or daily time played, of all 1,900 of the casino's machines, Justin Andrews, the MGM's executive director of slots, told the Wall Street Journal.

The cult slot machine even has a Facebook page and a Twitter account with the description: 'Tracking the MGM Lion's Share â€“ the progressive slot machine that still hasn't hit!'

'This game probably gets played about five times more than the average game on our casino floor,' Andrews told the Wall Street Journal, adding that staff are constantly being asked where the machine is by curious visitors.

Hot slot: The Lion's Share is MGM's most-played slot machine

Ungenerous: The machine pays out smaller prizes on a regular basis but the jackpot remains elusive

Numerous other social media forums track the lucrative machine's payouts.

Unlike the newer machines surrounding it, the Lion's Share has old-fashioned levers gamblers pull and just a modest sign advertising its jackpot total.

Rumor has it that so desperate is the casino to be rid of it that whoever wins the jackpot will also get to take home the Lion's Share.

With each passing year the slot machine's fame grows and so does the jackpot.

Desperately seeking: Many come to Vegas with the sole intention of winning the Lion's Share jackpot and sit on the machine for hours at a time

It's now at $2.3 million, having taken the money of a generation of gamblers and drawing in a whole new one along the way.

Siubhan Pabst, 34, is one such gambler.

'I'm not normally like this, but with this machine, I talk to it. Whenever a lion comes up, I rub it. I know it's strange, but the machine has this juju about it,' Pabst told the Wall Street Journal.

The San Jose, California native says she's constantly on tenterhooks that somebody else will score the big prize and monitors the machine's payouts constantly.

'Every time you get an email notification you're like oh s***. Did somebody win?' she says.
