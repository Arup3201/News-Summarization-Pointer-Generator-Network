Chelsea are sweating on the fitness of Diego Costa after the striker suffered a minor muscular injury during training on Wednesday.

The Spain striker, who has scored to goals in two games already this season, will be monitored by the club over the coming days ahead of the weekend's match against Everton.

Costa took full part in double training at the club’s Cobham base on Wednesday and the injury was only discovered after the session had ended.

The £32million summer signing from Atletico Madrid has been in sparkling early season form for the Blues', netting in both their Premier League victories against Burnley and Leicester.

Costa's injury could mean Fernando Torres' move away from Stamford Bridge is halted with Jose Mourinho only other options upfront being Didier Drogba.

Torres is ready to accept a loan move from Chelsea to AC Milan - with an agreement over the player's wages needing to be agreed between the two clubs.

The 30-year-old has two years left on a Chelsea contract which is worth £9million-a-year to him but Milan’s offer stretches to £7m for what would be one year on loan in Serie A.

Jose Mourinho would love to offload Torres, who cost the club £50m in January 2012 from Premier League rivals Liverpool, and open space in his squad and recruit a different type of attacker but the board at Stamford Bridge are not prepared to pay the £2m shortfall.

Milan vice-president Adriano Galliani confirmed his club was in talks over Torres on Tuesday.

He said: 'Our goal is to take a great striker. Fernando Torres? He is a great striker. Let’s see if he comes or someone else. We are actively working.'
