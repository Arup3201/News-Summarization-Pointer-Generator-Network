A cheating wife tried to hire a hitman to wipe her husband 'off the face of the earth' after she started a series of affairs with other men, a court heard.

Kelly Cliff, 40, is accused of hatching a 'cold-blooded' two-year plot to kill Carl Gallagher, 47, following a string of relationships with other men.

Wolverhampton Crown Court heard the mother-of-two asked friend Dalton Bowen, 45, to arrange her estranged husband's death as she wanted to end their 22-year relationship 'once and for all'.

Accused: Kelly Cliff, 40, who is on trial after allegedly trying to hire a hitman to wipe her husband 'off the face of the earth'

But jurors were told 'violent' Bowen shopped his former neighbour to police telling officers: 'I may have a reputation for kicking a**- but I don't go around killing people'.

Cliff made the calculated decision to cause or arrange the death of her husband on April 3 this year after leaving him for at least two other men, the court heard.

Opening the case, prosecutor Hugh O'Brien-Quinn said: 'She wanted him dead - she wanted to be rid of him, rid of him permanently.

'It was a cold blooded calculated decision which she had thought about for two years. Their 22-year relationship was punctuated by numerous splits.

'These were caused by the defendant's affairs with other men. Then Carl Gallagher forgave her and they would get back together.'

Mr O'Brien-Quinn said Cliff left the couple's home with another man in September last year. Although by Christmas she had moved back into the house in Aldridge, West Midlands.

The court heard just four months later Cliff was again seeing another man which was when she decided to 'be rid of her partner once and for all'.

Mr O'Brien Quinn added: 'In April this year she was seeing another man.

'She said it was just a bit of fun and nothing serious but against the background she decided to be rid of her partner once and for all.

'The reason she chose Dalton Bowen to kill her husband was because he was trusted as a friend, was a man of violence and somebody who was unlikely to speak to police'.

However, the father-of-five was so shocked by the suggestion that he instead went to the police who arrested Cliff, jurors were told.

Giving evidence Mr Bowen described the moment Cliff turned up at his home 'out of the blue' to ask how much it would cost to have her husband killed.

Bowen, from Bilston, West Midlands, said: 'She said she wanted her partner killed, wiped off the face of the earth.

'She did not want him to suffer but she said she did not want to know how or when it was done. She just wanted to know when the police came and told her he was dead.

'I have a reputation for kicking ass - using my fists - but I do not use tools and do not go around to kill people. I was meant to find out who would do it - when and how much it would cost.'

On April 5, Bowen went to a police station and told officers what Cliff had allegedly asked him to do. She was arrested later that night.

Cliff denies soliciting the murder of her husband. The trial continues.
