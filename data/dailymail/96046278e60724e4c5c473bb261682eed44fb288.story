Team news

Tottenham

Federico Fazio will miss Tottenham's return to Barclays Premier League action against Newcastle this weekend through suspension.

The 27-year-old summer signing was sent off on his top-flight debut against Manchester City, ruling him out of Sunday's match at White Hart Lane.

Nabil Bentaleb and Kyle Naughton will have ankle complaints assessed before the Magpies' visit, while Kyle Walker remains absent after abdominal surgery.

Tottenham provisional squad: Lloris, Vorm, Naughton, Rose, Davies, Vertonghen, Chiriches, Dier, Kaboul, Capoue, Stambouli, Paulinho, Dembele, Mason, Bentaleb, Eriksen, Lennon, Townsend, Chadli, Lamela, Soldado, Adebayor, Kane.

Newcastle United striker Papiss Cisse is a doubt for the Magpies' trip to White Hart Lane on Sunday

Newcastle

Newcastle boss Alan Pardew is keeping his fingers crossed over a series of injury doubts as he prepares to name his team to face Tottenham on Sunday.

In-form striker Papiss Cisse is a doubt with a knee problem, while fellow forward Emmanuel Riviere, who missed last weekend's 1-0 Barclays Premier League win over Leicester with an unspecified knock, is in a similar situation. So too are defenders Mike Williamson (muscle problem), Paul Dummett (hamstring) and midfielders Cheick Tiote (calf) and Sammy Ameobi (knock).

Utility man Ryan Taylor returns to the squad for the first time in 26 months after two cruciate ligament injuries and Rolando Aarons (hamstring) is also on the mend, but fellow midfielder Siem de Jong is unlikely to return until January as he continues to battle his way back from a torn thigh muscle.

Provisional squad: Krul, Elliot, Janmaat, Dummett, Haidara, R Taylor, Coloccini, Williamson, S Taylor, Tiote, Anita, Sissoko, Colback, Cabella, Gouffran, Obertan, Ameobi, Riviere, Cisse, Perez, Armstrong.
