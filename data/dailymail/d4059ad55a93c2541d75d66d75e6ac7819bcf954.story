Former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher refused the Pope's compromise, saying that there were worse things than war, including 'the extinction of all that one believed in'

Pope John Paul II tried to persuade Margaret Thatcher to stop fighting Argentina over the Falkland Islands, newly uncovered documents have revealed.

The Vatican urged the Prime Minister to reach an ‘honourable compromise’ with the military junta in Buenos Aires over the future of the remote group of islands in the South Atlantic.

But Mrs Thatcher defiantly rejected the peace plea, insisting there could be ‘no compromise between right and wrong’.

The Pope asked Mrs Thatcher to 'compromise' with the Argentine government, fearing that defeat for Argentina would topple its right-wing government, allowing the Soviets to seize more power in the region.

But a top-secret memo, released after 23 years, shows how the Iron Lady resisted, saying that the Argentines should 'go home and leave the Queen's people'.

According to the Sunday Express Mrs Thatcher confessed that the war was a 'terrible evil' but not as terrible as 'the extinction of all that one believed in.'

The Pope made the plea through Cardinal Agostino Casaroli, one of his most senior diplomats, who visited the UK ahead of the pontiff's arrival on May 28 1982.

The 50-minute meeting took place in secret with no Cabinet ministers present at around 6.40pm.

According to the memo, written by Thatcher's private personal secretary Sir Clive Whitmore to Sir Brian Fell, principal private secretary to the foreign secretary, the meeting was almost entirely devoted to the Falklands.

Mr Whitmore wrote that the Pope had concerns over 'dangerous consequences' of a 'general' kind.

The Holy See worried that toppling the Argentine government would allow the Soviets the opportunity to drive a wedge between the West and Latin America.

The plea came just hours after British troops capture Goose Green, marking the first land battle of the war

Instead, John Paul II suggests that an 'honourable' compromise might suit all parties better.

Just hours before the visit took place, around 500 British paratroopers from British Falklands Task Force recaptured Goose Green from 1,200 Argentinian soldiers, marking the first land battle of the war.

While the victory was a resounding success for the military, it came at a cost of 17 British lives.
