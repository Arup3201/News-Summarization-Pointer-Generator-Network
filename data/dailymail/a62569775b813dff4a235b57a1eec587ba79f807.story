Britain's welfare budget is to be capped at around £120billion-a-year to stop the benefits bill ballooning out of control.

Chancellor George Osborne wants to limit the total amount the state spends on handouts, with ministers forced to face a Commons vote if costs spiral.

Only pensions and Jobseekers Allowance will be excluded, meaning a raft of payments including pensioner benefits, income support, maternity pay and most housing benefit could be in the firing line.

Britain's bill for pensions and benefits is forecast to hit £167billion by 2016-17

Mr Osborne argues that under Labour spending on benefits was 'out of control', with the number of people who have never worked doubling in a decade.

He wants to use the new cap on total welfare spending to keep a tighter grip on the nation’s finances, so that future Chancellors do not allow benefits to rise when times are good.

The Office for Budget Responsibility will set a forecast for each of the next five years.

If the government is going to breach the cap, the Work and Pensions Secretary will be summoned to the Commons to explain what action, if any, they plan to take before facing a vote.

Mr Osborne told MPs: 'Britain should always be proud of having a welfare system that helps those most in need.

'But never again should we allow its costs to spiral out of control and its incentives to become so distorted that it pays not to work.

'In future, any government that wants to spend more on benefits will: have to be honest with the public about the costs, need the approval of Parliament, and will be held to account by this permanent cap on welfare.'

The move is designed to challenge the Labour party to match the Tories’ tough approach to benefits.

But
 it has proved controversial because it will include most benefits 
within the control of ministers, except Jobseekers Allowance or the 
state pension.

Mr Osborne insists he will not cut pensions 'for those who’ve worked hard all their lives because the costs on, say, housing benefit for young people had got out of control'.

Jobseekers Allowance will not be included, because it rises and falls in line with the state of the economy.

Mr Osborne argues that the government has a 'responsibility to taxpayers' to control spending on welfare and in turn Parliament has 'a responsibility to the country to hold the government to account for it'.

Housing benefit, Disability Living Allowance and Employment and Support Allowance make up the biggest expenditure on beneifts

Last month Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith said pensioner benefits including free TV licences, bus passes and help with heating bills would be included in the cap.

He warned existing protections for a raft of benefits would have to ‘disappear’ once the government sets a limit on the £100billion welfare bill.

In December Mr Cameron admitted that maternity and paternity pay for new parents would be included in a new cap on welfare spending.

The cost of the benefits, which are paid to mothers and fathers who take time off work to look after their children, is set to exceed £2.5billion a year within four years as more parents take them up.

Housing benefit is the single biggest cost for the taxpayer, totalling £23.8billion in 2013-14.

Disability Living Allowance costs £13.8billion, Employment and Support Allowance £9.6billion and Attendance Allowance £5.6billion.

The bill for Income Support is £3.3billion, carer's allowance £2.1billion and maternity pay £2.4billion.

Winter fuel payments cost £2.2billion, and TV licences for the over-75s £604million.
