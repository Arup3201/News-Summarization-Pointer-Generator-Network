Bungling border police burst into the 'sham' wedding of two Harrods workers and halted it before realising the marriage was real.

Chinese bride Miao Guo, 34, and Italian groom Massimo Ciabattini, 31, were taking their vows in Camden Town Hall when four border police in thick black jackets stormed into the room.

They led the pair and their two bridesmaids away into separate rooms and questioned them for 30 minutes before realising they had made a mistake.

The bride and groom were then allowed back into the room and they later got married.

Officials had become suspicious because the pair, who met at Harrods in Knightsbridge, had trouble spelling each other's surnames and the bride's visa was due to expire in six weeks.

The only guests at the wedding were the bridesmaids.

They were so pleased that they were about to break up a sham wedding that they invited a local newspaper reporter from the Camden New Journal along to watch.

Groom: Massimo Ciabattini, a retail manager, who got married to his Chinese partner

But, when they realised they had made a mistake, the journalist was quickly ushered away.

A worker for the Home Office admitted afterwards: 'It is either the best sham wedding I have ever seen or it is real'.

Before the wedding ceremony began at 4pm last Thursday plain-clothed officials from the Home Office waited outside the town hall, in north London, while the border police hid out of sight in a car.

Officials usually wait until the wedding is underway to avoid the bride and groom fleeing.

Mr Ciabattini listed his job title as a retail manager on his wedding certificate, while his bride wrote that she was a sales associate.

The Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants condemned the Home Office and accused them of 'operating generally on a basis of mistrust' when it came to international marriages.

The wedding had been 'red flagged' by 
Camden Council as a possible sham marriage in advance - and they had 
called in the Home Office to investigate.

The border police called in to carry out the raid are employed by the Home Office.

However, the couple's answers to questions about their relationship and life had matched up perfectly - and they had genuine bookings afterwards at a restaurant with friends and a hotel room for the night.

An official added that the fact the couple were 'extremely good-looking' and wearing expensive, tailored clothes, and had a real Chanel handbag, would also have been a clue that it was genuine as visa weddings are frequently performed by 'very mismatched couples' who turn up for the service in 'anoraks'.

Guy Taylor, of the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants, added: 'That does not justify them operating generally on a basis of mistrust. They do not take people's sides they automatically assume that people are out to swindle the visa regulations, that is their default position. That is what leads to this type of appalling mistake.'

He questioned why better background checks had not been made on the couple beforehand in order to avoid ruining their ceremony.

'It does devastate wedding days,' he said. 'This is a life event where people's expectations, money and energy is being poured into this one day and the Home Office don't seem to care about ruining it by not making better background checks. Why didn't they interview them beforehand?"

A spokesman from Camden Council said: 'We are legally obliged to report any suspected sham marriages or civil partnerships to the Home Office, based on the criteria outlined in the Immigration and Asylum Act of 1999. It is then for the Home Office to decide how to progress and whether to take action.'

A spokesman for the Home Office said: 'Where suspicions are raised that a marriage may not be genuine we will investigate. On this occasion no action was taken.

'We continue to work closely with registrars to prevent people from abusing the marriage system in a bid to get round our immigration laws.'
