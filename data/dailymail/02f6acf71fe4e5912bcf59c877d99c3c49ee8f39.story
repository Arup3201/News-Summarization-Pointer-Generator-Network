It will give shopping centres valuable data on where customers go and how long they spend there. But it might feel a bit like they're spying on you.

Two U.S. malls in California and Richmond, Virginia, are launching a trial to track shopper’s movements through their mobile phone signals.

The novel idea will run between Black Friday and New Year’s Day at Short Pump Town Center in Virginia and Promenade Temecula in California.

Forest City Commercial Management, which manages both malls, will not hold personal data as everything tracked is anonymous, reported CNN.

With millions of Americans being worked up into a sweat over potential bargains to be had on Black Friday, scientists have come up with the perfect way of working out what excites them the most.

Wearing perspiration-sensitive brace, 50 shoppers in Los Angeles, Boston and Atlanta were monitored by experts from the Massechusetts Institute of Technology Media Lab.

The information they retrieve will then be sold on to retailers, who are always keen to find out what makes people spend.

Crucially, the bracelet wearers will shop both in store and online – allowing firms to discover what difference –if any – it makes to the buying experience.

It measures movement, body temperature and electrodermal activity – barely noticeable changes in skin sweat levels, the Wall Street Journal reported.

If a shopper’s excited or frustrated, electrodermal activity will go up. If they’re relaxed or bored, it will go down.

‘We won't be looking at singular shoppers,’ Forest City’s Stephanie Shriver-Engdahl told CNN. ‘The system monitors patterns of movement.

‘We can see, like migrating birds, where people are going to,’ she added, saying they have no need to know anybody’s phone number or identity.

Shopping centres have previously tracked the movement of people - but mobile phones have never been used to achieve this.

Customers do not have to participate 
in the trial - but they will have to turn off their phones to make sure 
they aren't involved, reported CNN.

Signs around the malls are already 
warning people about the system, which works through a number of 
strategically-positioned antennas.

They will pick up the phone’s 
identification number and track it through the area, but it cannot 
take photos or store purchase details, reported CNN.

The technology has been used in Europe
and Australia, but that does not stop some critics getting worried 
about the system’s security.

‘Most
of this information is harmless and nobody ever does anything nefarious
with it,’ Sucharita Mulpuru of Forrester Research told CNN.

‘But (what) happens when you start having hackers potentially having access to this information and being able to track your movements?’

Hackers' attempts will however be made more difficult by the fact the identification numbers will be scrambled twice.
