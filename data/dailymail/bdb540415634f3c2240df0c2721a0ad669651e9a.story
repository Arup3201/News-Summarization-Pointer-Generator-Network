Confession: Thomas Kiely, 57, laundered £235,000 in seven years, while he and his wife Caroline Lewis (background) claimed £60,000 in benefits

A loan shark begged a judge not to send him to prison telling a court his rates were 'better than payday lender Wonga.com', after admitting laundering £235,000.

Over the course of seven years Thomas Kiely netted the profits of his loan shark scheme while he and his wife Caroline Lewis claimed £60,000 in state benefits.

When he was caught, the 57-year-old said he drew only an 'average wage' from the business, and was 'providing a service' to desperate people only payday lenders would touch.

Manchester Crown Court heard Kiely’s dozens of customers paid between 50 and 100 per cent interest with ‘penalties’ for paying late.

A handwritten loan book revealed a snapshot of how lucrative the scheme was - with £107,000 worth of repayments, outstanding debts and late payment fees racked up by 25 people over just seven months.

But Nicola Gatto, defending, told the court: 'Within his community there are large numbers of people who, because of their debt history are very limited in terms of the places they can go, other than companies such as Wonga.

'Their rates are utterly exorbitant and far greater than the rates being charged by Mr Kiely.'

The court heard Kiely came from an Irish travelling family who ‘kept their wealth in gold’ and that he sold inherited jewellery to fund his loans.

The racket paid for luxurious family breaks in Thailand and Tenerife at a time when the couple were jobless.

Investigators also found bundles of banknotes stashed in every room of their flat.

Kiely was jailed for 26 months after admitting three counts of benefit fraud, illegal money lending and one charge of money laundering, between 2006 and last year.

His 47-year-old wife, Caroline Lewis, was jailed for 10 months alongside him after admitting four counts of benefit fraud and one charge of money laundering, following an investigation by the Birmingham-based Illegal Money Lending Team.

The pair from Monsall, Manchester, laundered £235,000 in total.

Judge David Hernandez said hardworking members of the public were entitled to revulsion at their crimes.

Miss Gatto, defending former labourer Kiely, said limited schooling, a stammer and poor health, including injuries from a 2004 shooting, meant he ‘lived on his wits’.

Mark Monaghan, defending Lewis, said: 'There are no Rolls Royces or Jaguars here.

'The Office of National Statistics has the average worker’s income before tax at £26,000.

'Over the years, this comes to about the same.

'I know the difference is that the average person on an average wage would have to pay tax - but these defendants lived very modestly, but periodically had a nice holiday.'

Mr Monaghan claimed Kiely’s lowest rate worked out at 200 per cent APR over a three-month repayment period.

He added: 'If you can find a payday lender like Wonga with an APR under four figures I will not quite eat my wig, but I will be impressed.'

Defence: Nicola Gatto, defending Kiely, told the court: 'Within his community there are large numbers of people who, because of their debt history are very limited in terms of the places they can go, other than companies such as Wonga. Their rates are utterly exorbitant and far greater than the rates being charged by Mr Kiely'
