To those who say that playing video games is a waste of time, a man from South Korea has proved otherwise.

Dong-hwan 'Violet' Kim has earned nearly $100,000 playing games and now he also has a visa that will allow him to live in America as well.

Kim has become the first professional StarCraft 2 player to receive a P-1A internationally recognized athlete visa.

The U.S. professional athlete visa is the same kind that many swimmers and gymnasts use to live in in the United States while perfecting their sport.

In the zone: This man is a professional.  23 year old Dong-hwan 'Violet' Kim received a P-1A visa in order to move to the US, to train, compete, and even make a living there for the next five years playing computer games

Athlete: South Korean Gamer Kim Dong Hwan, who is a professional gamer is the first StarCraft player to be granted a traditional pro athlete visa in the United States

The news is said to have brought Kim to tears, and is the second ever instance of gamers being recognized as athletes by the US.

The visa is for those 'coming to the U.S. temporarily to perform at a specific athletic competition as an athlete, individually or as part of a group or team, at an internationally recognized level of performance,' according to the U.S. government.

It will allow Kim to travel and earn money in the US for the next five years according to The Daily Dot.

Nice little earner: Violet, as Kim is known, as earned nearly $100,000 by playing video games

StarCraft is a military science fiction real-time strategy video game.

Set in a fictitious timeline during the Earth's 25th century, the game revolves around three species fighting for dominance in a distant part of the Milky Way galaxy.

Many of the gaming industry's journalists have praised StarCraft as one of the best and most important video games of all time, and for having raised the bar for developing real-time strategy games.

The game has been praised for pioneering the use of unique factions in real-time strategy gameplay and for a compelling story

Kim was ecstatic. '’I’ve been so jealous when others Koreans traveled to the USA for tournaments.

I have been trying to go to USA as well, but I got denied 3 times, and I was almost ready to give up … really almost, it was lots [of] drama … but my manager found out another last way, and we worked hard together.

If we got denied this last time too, yea, I would pretty much have to retire .. no more esports,' he said.

'Seven months of work, and 500 pages later, it has paid off, and I couldn't be more thrilled for Dong-Hwan,' said Andrew Tomlinson, founder of Cyber Solutions Agency (CSA), which represents Kim.

'I want to especially thank all those who helped in this long process with us, without your valuable support I am not sure if Violet would still be in eSports.'

The idea: StarCraft pits humans and two alien species against each other in a real-time strategy game that requires players to keep track of military operations, resources, and manufacturing

Gaming craft: This is only the second time an eSports competitor has gotten an athletic visa, and now, the government may view them on the same level

Earlier this year, the United States elected to allow professional gamers the right to apply for the same visa that a traditionally-recognized athlete would apply for.

The first gamer ever to receive this type of visa was Danny Le, a League of Legends player who was granted a visa earlier this year

Now Kim has also made history, being the first StarCraft player to be awarded the same honor.

E-Sports, or electronic sports, refers to competitive video game competitions among professional players. StarCraft 2 is one of the most popular eSports platforms.

Some sporting athletes may not put gamers in the same league as them, let alone immigration level as professional athletes, but there's no questioning Kim's passion.

While playing Warcraft 3 at home in 2009, he was unaware that his house was on fire until the electricity went out.

'As a young Orc prospect, he had won several games that night when the power went out and he finally opened the door to see the disaster that was consuming his home,' the Daily Dot said.

Kim was hospitalized for smoke inhalation but later recovered. He is expected to arrive in the US this month.

Access granted: Kim was facing early retirement if he wasn't granted US-entry. Over the course of seven months, he and his manager penned a 500-page application to immigration services
