Adam Lallana is fighting to regain his fitness as the £25million signing from Southampton was put   to the test  in training by Brendan Rodgers on Thursday.

Liverpool make their Premier League start against Lallana's former club Southampton on Sunday, where the Reds will look to kick-start a fresh bid for the title after last year's disappointment.

The attacking midfielder has been set to miss the start of the season after Liverpool confirmed a knee injury suffered at the end of July during pre-season in Boston would rule the England international out for up to six weeks.

Lallana's former Southampton team-mate Rickie Lambert, who is fit and ready to make his Premier League debut for Liverpool against his old club on Sunday, joined him in training.

It comes after Rodgers insisted he would not heap the pressure on the striker, who failed to score his first goal for the club during pre-season. 

The 32-year-old made the move at the beginning of June for £4m, but couldn't get off the mark for his boyhood club in any of their friendlies.

Rodgers told Sky Sports News: 'Don't put pressure on Rickie Lambert to get goals, Rickie Lambert has been brought in here to be a very valuable member of our squad.

'He has proven it all his career. He has got goals at whatever level he has played at.

'He came on for internationals and he gets goals, with Southampton for the past couple of seasons he gets goals.

'So there is no need for him to be under any pressure, he needs to come in at 32 years of age and contribute to the history of this club.

'He's a big supporter of this club, he is past that now, he is here to do a job. I trust him to do the job and he will do a great job for us.'
