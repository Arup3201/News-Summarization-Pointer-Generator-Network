Hillary Clinton is running for president, Comedy Central host Jon Stewart declared Tuesday night on The Daily Show, and the former secretary of state played along – even saying she prefers a 'home office' with 'fewer corners' than usual.

U.S. presidents work in the famed Oval Office, a White House room with no corners.

Speculation about the potential for a 2016 Clinton White House run has consumed America's political chattering classes since she resigned from President Barack Obama's cabinet early in 2013.

New, less comfortable questions may intrude into the discussion, however, since questions and answers between Stewart and Clinton about the Middle East were left on the cutting room floor.

President Hilarity: Former U.S. Secretary of State, U.S. senator and first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton entertained 'Daily Show' host Jon Stewart on Tuesday with her latest series of playful hints about running for president

The Oval Office at the White House has no corners and is unique among workplaces of world leaders

Clinton's case got somewhat stronger with the publication last month of a memoir, 'Hard Choices,' a book that has since been bumped down best-seller lists by an unflattering retelling of her feuds with Obama.

As Stewart held Clinton's book sideways to show the cameras its heft, Hillary quipped that it represented 'a lot of hard choices.'

'Not for your editor.' a playful Stewart shot back.

Clinton 
later said she 'put my heart and soul into' the book. But reports have 
swirled around Washington, including one from famed Hollywood reporter 
and former Fox News journalist Roger Friedman, that a ghostwriter did most of the heavy lifting.

Brown
 University historian Ted Widmer, according to Friedman, wrote the book.

Historian Ted Widmer, a onetime Bill Clinton speechwriter, is reportedly the true author of 'Hard Choices'

He was a speechwriter near the end of the Bill Clinton White House 
years, and conducted many of the interviews that formed the basis for 
the former president's own memoir, 'My Life.'

The
 Comedy Central interview, broadcast in two segments, was marred by a 
pair of abrupt cuts. An Associated Press report suggests what was left 
out.

Clinton and Stewart, the AP writes, 'moved on to a series of national and international issues Clinton faced as secretary of state, including the violence and tension between Israel and the Palestinians.'

'"We're really in a terrible dilemma," she said, noting there has been an offer of a cease-fire brokered by Egypt that Israel accepted but that was rejected by Hamas, which controls the Gaza Strip.'

'Part of what I see Hamas doing is, their identity comes from being the violent resistance,' Clinton said, according to the AP report written between the taping and when the show aired.

But Hillary's time in the State Department and her book-length retelling of it necessarily took a back seat on Tuesday, even as images of the 'Hard Choices' cover danced on TV monitors in Stewart's New York City studio.

It's 'incredibly complex and well-reasoned,' he said. 'And I think I speak for everyone when I say no one cares. They just want to know if you're running for president.'  

Not so hard: Clinton told Stewart she 'put my heart and soul into' her memoir, 'Hard Choices,' although ghostwriter Ted Widmer reportedly produced the manuscript

Hillary 
laughed: 'I was going to make an announcement, but you kind of spoiled 
it for me. So I'm just going to have to reconsider.'

The
 studio audience's earlier cheers had already betrayed their enthusiasm 
for a Clinton 2016 ticket, cheers that continued as a half-joking 
Stewart seemed to paint her into a corner with a series of questions 
culled from a high-school career aptitude test.

'Do you like commuting to work, or do you like a home office?' he asked.

'I've spent so many years commuting that I kinda prefer a home office,' Hillary replied. 'That's where I wrote my book.'

As anticipation ratcheted up, Stewart uncorked the next gag.

'Do you have a favorite shape for that home office? Would you like that office to have corners?' he grinned.

'You know,' Clinton replied knowingly, 'I think the world is so complicated, the fewer corners that you have –'

The audience's wild cheers drowned out the rest of her sentence.

It's 'incredibly complex and well-reasoned,' the comedian Stewart said of Clinton's memoir, 'and I think I speak for everyone when I say no one cares: They just want to know if you're running for president'

Other questions were more serious, drawing answers from Clinton that will seem familiar to Republicans who are critical of Obama's 'pen and phone' approach to working around Congress.

Asked whether 'the bureaucracy of government [has] become unmanageable,' Clinton replied that America has 'a Congress that is no longer functioning effectively.'

She added that presidents face 'a very difficult situation in our executive branch because ... it has not kept up with the times. We don't have the kind of agility and flexibility' other nations enjoy.

Her statement seemed to be a veiled reply to GOP critics of Obama's many end-runs around the Republican-controlled House of Representatives, including immigration deportation waivers and numerous unilateral tweaks to the Affordable Care Act.

'We need comprehensive immigration reform,' Clinton said as one reason the White House should have more power.
