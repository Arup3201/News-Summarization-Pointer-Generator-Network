Dried-out southern California got a much-needed sprinkling of rain on Sunday, but at the cost of rockslides which trapped more than a dozen cars in mud and shut down 10 miles of the Pacific Coast Highway.

No one was injured, but the slides raise fears that more damage could be in store when heavier rains arrive on Tuesday as part of a storm that has already started hitting northern California. 

Downtown Los Angeles received 1.4 inches of rain on Sunday, which led to slides in nearby Malibu. 

A stretch of the highly-trafficked Pacific Coast Highway was closed Sunday after it became covered in a few inches to a foot of debris and led 10 to 15 vehicles to become stranded in the muck.

Closed: A 10-mile stretch of the Pacific Coast Highway in Malibu, California was shut down on Sunday after rains caused a rockslide on the highly-trafficked road

Impassable: More than a dozen vehicles became stuck in the debris on the road, but no one was injured 

All of the drivers and occupants of the impacted vehicles were able to safely exit their vehicles without injury. Some of the vehicles were extricated, while others were abandoned until the rains stopped.  Officials said the road may not be fully cleaned up and reopened until Tuesday.

Now southern Californians are bracing for Tuesday's storm, which is expected to be the biggest rainfall to hit the region since last February.

That storm system is expected to start Tuesday morning bring 1-2 inches of rain to the coastal and valley areas, and 2-5 inches in the foothills and mountains. 

While the heaviest rain will happen Tuesday, according to the National Weather Service, light showers will continue on Wednesday and into Thursday.

Next round: More rain is expected to hit the drought-plagued southern California region on Tuesday, with 1-2 inches falling in the coastal and valley areas, and 2-5 inches in the foothills and mountains

Eighty per cent of California is currently experiencing a state of extreme drought, so the rain comes as a godsend for the state's reservoirs which have been withering the past three dry years.  

However, the drought has also sparked several disastrous wildfires recently which create soil conditions hazardous to mud and rockslides when rain does fall. There were more than 5,500 wildfires in 2014, which is 1,000 more than usual. 

Road conditions are also a concern, since dry weather causes oil to accumulate on the road and it can become slick when hit with rain.  

Residents in the areas of the recent Colby and Springs wildfires, which burned up several thousand acres each in the areas of the San Gabriel Mountains and Santa Monica Mountains respectively, were put on notice Sunday that the rain could cause damage. 

No evacuations have been ordered yet, but residents are being asked to remove vehicles, trash bins and other obstructions from the roadways. 

In Glendora, which was hit with mudslides just last week, residents stacked sandbags in anticipation for Tuesday's rains, and concrete barriers were set up outside the homes. 

Preparations: Tuesday's rains bring the chance of further mud and rockslides, especially in areas where wildfires have recently happened. Above, residents in Glendora, California have lined up sandbags outside their homes

Shield: Concrete barriers are lined up outside a home in Glendora, California to protect it from potential mud and rockslides this week 

Downtown Los Angeles has only seen a half of inch of rain this year, which is 1.5 inches lower than usual. The rain on Tuesday could bring the year totals up to normal, but climatologist Bill Patzert told the Los Angeles Times that 'one storm is not a drought buster'. 

'Hopefully it is a small down payment and is a preview of the coming attractions in the next few months. 

Southern California has been experiencing unusually warm temperatures recently, which may predict an El NIno weather pattern. 

An El Nino is the warming of the Pacific Ocean which causes more rain, but climatologists believe if an El Nino happens it will be relatively weak. Currently, the estimates of an El Nino happening stand at 58 per cent.
