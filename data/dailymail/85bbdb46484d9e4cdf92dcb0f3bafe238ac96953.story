A 7-year-old girl who contracted the bubonic plague during a camping trip with her family is set to leave the hospital after nearly succumbing to the rare and extremely deadly disease last month.

Seen taking her first steps this weekend, Sierra Jane Downing is said to be lucky to be alive after experiencing a series of unusual symptoms that left doctors in Denver, Colorado struggling for a cure.

Just five days after that camping trip on August 19, Sierra's parents found her on the bathroom floor of their home after suffering a seizure that stopped her breathing.

Survivor: Seen wheeled out of her hospital room earlier this week, 7-year-old Sierra Jane Downing is the latest survivor of the bubonic plague in the U.S.

Rushing the child to a local hospital before airlifting her to Denver's Rocky Mountain Hospital for Children, doctors were continually stumped on what was wrong with the girl, as her condition deteriorated.

'I thought, "Oh my gosh, we're going to lose her." I was very concerned,' her mother Darcy Downing told ABC News.

'I remember leaving that morning very scared that when I came back that night she wasn't going to survive,' Dr Jennifer Snow recounted to ABC.

It was a paediatric doctor at the Rocky Mountain Hospital who got the first inkling that she had the bubonic plague, a rare disease that Federal health officials say is reported an average of seven times in the U.S. each year.

Rarity: Showing the disease on a petre dish, infectious disease specialist Dr Wendi Drummond who treated Sierra said she's never seen it herself before until now

'There's a saying in medicine: if you hear hoof beats, look for horses,' the hospital's infectious disease specialist Dr Wendi Drummond told ABC.

'But you don't want to forget about the zebras - the more unusual, uncommon diseases. And in this case, this is a zebra,' she said.

The doctor figured it out using Sierra's symptoms, a history of where she'd been, as well as an online journal search. The bubonic plague hasn't been confirmed in a human in Colorado since 2006.

Doctors believe Sierra Jane Downing contracted the disease, also known as the 'black death', from a dead squirrel while camping with her family in Pagosa Springs.

Success: Sierra is expected to be released from the Rocky Mountain Hospital for Children at St Luke's on Monday

In a news conference on Wednesday, 
Sierra's parents recounted their daughter asking if she could bury the 
squirrel that was found half-eaten in the woods.

While her parents said no, the girl is said to have returned to the animal and after kneeling beside it, dropped her sweater to the ground.

Fleas, most likely jumping onto that sweater her doctors reason, are common transmitters of the plague.

'She had a high heart rate and low blood pressure,' Dr Snow said. 'It all originally pointed to signs of what's called septic shock.'

With the doctors’ fast thinking, they were able to set her on a course of gentamicin, an antibiotic used to treat bacterial infections.

Revelling in her daughter’s dramatically improved health this week, Mrs Downing praised the doctors for their help in saving her daughter’s life.

'They set her on my lap and she just melted into me and she said, "Mommy, it feels so good to be held," her mother said. 'That was the best moment. The best.'

Doctors say Sierra will make a full recovery and is expected to be released on Monday.

Without treatment the plague kills around two thirds of infected humans within four days.

'It's
one of those things that you don't necessarily expect to see,' Dr 
Drummond said. 'But, it's definitely one of those things you don't want 
to miss.'

Bubonic plague symptoms usually appear between two and five days after exposure to the bacteria. The symptoms include:

Other potential symptoms include heavy breathing, continuous vomiting of blood, aching limbs and extreme pain, usually caused by the decay of the skin while the person is still alive.
