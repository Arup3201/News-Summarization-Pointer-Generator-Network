Al Gore's youngest daughter has gotten remarried under a historic tree in Santa Barbara.

Sarah Gore has a very casual outdoor service on Good Friday outside a coffee shop with her famous father walking across a patch of grass that served as the makeshift aisle.

Wearing a loose, off-white lace dress with bell sleeves, Sarah made her way towards her groom, realtor Patrick Maiani, who was waiting for her beside the outline of a heart in the shape of rose petals.

Down the grassy aisle: Sarah Gore was accompanied by her father, former Vice President Al, for the Friday morning wedding service near Santa Barbara, California

Up close: The wedding was attended by a handful of invited guests (including the bride's mother Tipper seen taking a picture in the foreground) as well as onlookers who realized what was going on

The brief service was officiated by a female religious leader and attended by about a dozen invited guests.

The rest of the crowd was made of up onlookers- including Larry Nimmer who video taped the ceremony and uploaded it to his story Everyone Has A Story- who realized what was going on as soon as they spotted the service going on.

This is the 35-year-old's second marriage, though it is unclear when exactly she and her first husband Bill Lee split.

Sarah, a Harvard graduate who enrolled in medical school at the University of California-San Francisco before dropping out to become an artist, keeps a relatively low profile in spite of her father's fame and the latest articles written about her in 2012 noted that she was still married to Lee, a surfer and tech investor.

Her new husband, Patrick Maiani, is a realtor at 1 Percent Real Estate Group. Rather than imply something about the wealth of their clientele, the name apparently comes from the realtor's agreement to only take one per cent of a commission per transaction.

Symbolic: There was no altar involved in the outdoor service but the couple stood inside a heart-shaped ring of rose petals

Keeping with tradition: The biggest symbol of the ceremony was that the couple married underneath the Wardholme Torrey Pine, a historic tree that is the oldest of its kind in the world

She is now the only married member of the Gore family, as her two sisters- Karenna and Kristin- both split from their respective first husbands and their parents Al and Tipper announced their divorce in 2010.

Both the former vice president and his ex wife were spotted at Sarah's wedding, standing side-by-side as they watched their grown daughter say her vows.

Sarah's first wedding was dramatically different from the low-key affair that took place on Friday morning in Carpinteria, California.

In 2007, Sarah opted for an opulent affair with hundreds of guests at the Beverly Hills Hotel.

Happy: Sarah, who went to medical school but now is an artist living near Santa Barbara, split from her first husband sometime between 2012 and this weekend when she married Patrick Maiani (pictured), a local realtor

Theatrics: In keeping with the 'hippie' feel of her dress, Sarah opted for wooden wedges

Loving it: Gore was seen laughing at the big dip alongside his daughter Kristin

Instead of a multi-course, sit-down meal that guests were treated to at the first go around, the close friends and family had some coffee and snacks at Crushcakes, a coffee shop opposite the wedding site.

Coffee shop manager Alyssa Murphy told People Magazine that the couples dozen or so guests dined on huevos rancheros, scrambled eggs and lattes.

The former Vice President must have opted for some of the restaurant's baked goods instead, since he is famously vegan and does not eat animal products.

'It was a fun little intimate reception. They came in, had breakfast with their wedding party and cut their cake,' Ms Murphy said.

Light hearted: Maiani goofs around with a flower in his mouth as Sarah cuts the cake

On the house: The manager of the coffee shop said that they gave her a strawberry blush cupcake

Opting for a public venue and a local coffeeshop also has another added benefit: a much lower final bill.

The cost was likely not a determining factor, however, since the former Vice President's net worth is estimated to be more than $200million, a figure that shot up following the eight-figure sale of the TV network he launched, Current TV.

The location of the wedding also makes sense when looking at the Gore family's shared interest in environmentalism, as the ceremony took place beneath the Wardholme Torrey pine tree, which is the oldest of its kind in the world.

The fact that the wedding took place two days before Earth Day may just be a coincidence.

Peace and love: The happy couple posted a photo of themselves holding up 'peace signs' in front of a peace symbol that adorns the wall in the coffee shop where they had their 'reception'

Free spirits: Sarah and Patrick posed for a photo near the surf following the ceremony

Only one of Sarah's siblings- her sister Kristin- was spotted in the video that was shot by one of the onlookers. Neither her sister Karenna nor her brother Albert III were seen.

Karenna Gore married Manhattan doctor Drew Schiff in 1997 and had three children before splitting in 2010, just months after her parents Al and Tipper announced their own separation after 40 years of marriage.

Kristin Gore was the first of the family to file for divorce, splitting from her husband Paul Cusack in 2009 after four years of marriage.

Introduction to the world: The Gore children (left) were on stage with the Clintons and Chelsea (right) when Al and Bill were nominated to the Democratic ticket in 1992

The marital status of their brother Albert III is unclear, but stayed out of the spotlight since his father left the White House, making news only on the two occasions when he was arrested for marijuana possession.

The world was introduced to the Gore children in the early 1990s, and the then-teenagers' appearance at the 1992 Democratic Convention led to national crushes for many like-minded youngsters.

They have kept much further from the spotlight in recent years, and the low-key style of Sarah's wedding is reflective of that change.
