An Ohio sheriff has released 72 inmates because of budget cuts which he says are restricting his ability to safely run the jail.

The move by Summit County Sheriff Steve Barry in Akron on Sunday reduces the county jail's overall capacity by 149 beds, from 671 to 522.

Convicts, mostly with non-violent charges, beamed as they filed out of the now defunct wing to meet relatives and agencies outside the gates. 

Released: 72 inmates were released from Summit County Jail, Ohio, on Sunday after an entire wing was shut

Decision: Summit County Sherrif Steve Barry said he had no choice but to close the 150-bed wing

The jail has been reporting issues since the state cut local government funding by $1 billion in 2012.

The sheriff's spokesman Bill Holland told the Akron Beacon Journal lowing staffing meant inamtes were being kept in their cells longer, with less recreational time, leading to heightened tensions and fights.

To combat the issue, he said, staff had been refused holiday.

A table was set up outside the jail with hats, gloves and scarves for the inmates as temperatures dropped to 24 degrees. 

Some were unaware they were being released until hours before.

'I ain't happy because I've got to go back to court,' one inmate, who was not named, told ABC News.

Another said: 'I'm happy! I'm out!'  

Mixed feelings: One man (left) was  delighted. Another (right) raged that he has to go back to court

'Second chance': Antonio Spragling, jailed for drugs charges in November, said this is a second chance

Surprised: Many did not know they were going to be released until hours before the measure passed

Former inmate Antonio Spragling, 50, who was jailed for drug charges in November, told the Akron Beacon Journal: 'All I can do is thank God... I look at it as a second chance and I'm not going to let anyone down. No judge. The system. And more important, I'm not going to let myself down.' 

Most of the released men were taken home while some were transferred to alternative sentencing programs. 

The sheriff, who announced the planned measure last year, could not recall a similar release in the past. 

'I don't want these people out,' Barry told the journal. 'I got no choice.'

The next step: All inmates have been issued a court date to discuss the completion of their sentence

Barry, who began his sheriff's office career in 1979, said all the victims of the inmates have been contacted about the release.

The jail received about 50 new inmates over the last two days, complicating Sunday's release.

Cuts in state funding for local municipalities have squeezed the sheriff's budget, along with voters' November rejection of a county sales tax increase that would have generated about $20 million a year for 10 years.
