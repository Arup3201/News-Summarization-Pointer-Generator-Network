Many victims of theft dream of seeking revenge, but for one resourceful man it became a reality - and he captured the whole saga on camera. 

The cyclist from Portland was shocked to discover that a few days after his bike was stolen, it was advertised for sale on website Craigslist.

He immediately set up a sting operation by contacting the thief under the alias of Simon Jackson and arranged to travel 160 miles to Seattle to meet him.

Busted: Police arrest the bike thief after the successful sting operation

A video posted on YouTube shows that when the pair met outside a coffee 
shop, the victim immediately confronted him saying: 'So here's the deal -
I live in Portland and you stole my bicycle. This is my bicycle.'

The man shrugs his shoulders and replies: 'All right - I don't know what you want me to say.'

When the victim says 'I would like 
you to apologise,' the thief refuses saying: 'I bought this bike off of 
Craigslist, I live in Seattle.'

The victim tells him that he has
the paperwork and that police are on the way, but the man picks up his 
possessions from a nearby table and hastily moves away.

As he tries to make a run for it, 
he dashes into the path of the victim's friend who is capturing 
the saga on camera and shouts 'You're under citizen's arrest, stop
right 
now!'

The man runs away and the victim gives chase, before apprehending him.

The thief protests, saying: 'What do you want me to say?
I f****** got it like this off Craigslist, dude. I don't know what you 
want me to tell you or the cops, dude. I knew it was stolen, yes.

'It's not illegal to buy stolen stuff - I looked it up, dude.'

The Seattle Police arrive and after searching the man's pockets, they handcuff him and take him away in a police car.

The information posted on YouTube along with the video says: 'The bike was locked up with a mid-range Kryptonite U-Lock, the thief broke the lock. The lock was never recovered.

'We
called the cops just before Simon started talking with the thief.

'It 
took Seattle PD 45 minutes to get there. Simon decided to confront him 
when they neglected to show up.

'Once he did, however, they rolled up as 
you can see in the video.'

It's not the first time a stolen bike has been reclaimed by its owner after being posted on Craigslist.

Three months ago, a Washington, D.C. man took action when he saw his stolen bicycle posted on the website the day after it was nabbed from where it was chained up outside a friend’s house in the Brightwood area.

After meeting the thief he insisted on a test ride before parting with the cash, then pedaled round to a waiting car, put the bike in the trunk and left.
