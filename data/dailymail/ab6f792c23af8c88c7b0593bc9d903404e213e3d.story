The NHS budget for out-of-hours care has been slashed by almost 9 per cent in real terms in the last four years, shocking new figures show.

Thousands of patients have been left struggling for medical help when their GP is unavailable, flooding the NHS 111 helpline with calls and causing huge pressures at A&E departments.

Now ministers have admitted that the total amount of money available for care in evenings and at weekends was £40million lower in real terms last year than in 2009-10.

In 2013-14, there was £399.4million available for out of hours care in England but using 2013-14 prices to take into account the effect of inflation, it was worth £438.4million in 2009-10, the year before the coalition was formed

Hospitals in England have failed to meet waiting time targets in A&E for five months running.

The crisis has been blamed in part on people who are sick and injured being unable to see their GP.

New figures today showed the NHS is 'greater than ever before' as it emerged 900 more patients are being admitted to hospital every day compared with a year ago.

The government insists it has invested extra money into helping health trusts to deal with the rise.

David Cameron has insisted the NHS has risen in real terms under the coalition. In his party conference speech last year he declared: 'We in this party can be proud of what we've done. We came in and protected the NHS budget.

'The next Conservative Government will protect the NHS budget and continue to invest more.' 

But official figures reveal how the amount of money available for out of hours care has fallen year after year.

In 2013-14, there was £399.4million available for out of hours care in England.

But using 2013-14 prices to take into account the effect of inflation, it was worth £404,660 a year earlier and hit £438.4million in 2009-10, the year before the coalition was formed.

It means out-of-hours spending last year was lower than at any point since 2007-08.

Jamie Reed, Labour's shadow health minister, said: 'It is shocking that despite his promise to protect the NHS, David Cameron has cut out-of-hours care at the same time as wasting £3billion on a damaging NHS reorganisation he promised wouldn't happen.

'As a result, out-of-hours care is going downhill under the Tory-led Government, with patient satisfaction declining significantly since 2010. It is proof that you cannot trust David Cameron with the NHS.'

The figures were released by health minister Dan Poulter in response to a parliamentary question.

It shows how much has been spent on out-of-hours care since 2004, when GPs stopped being responsible for their patients at evenings and weekends as part of a lucrative new pay deal agreed by Labour.

Mr Poulter said: 'This Government has sought to improve access through the Prime Minister's Challenge Fund, which is making available £50 million this year and £100 million next year to improve access to general practice.'

Hospitals across England have failed to meet waiting time targets in A&E for the last 20 weeks

But the latest set of figures, published last week, reveal the misery for patients is ongoing, with no end in sight for medical staff who are under mounting pressure.

NHS England said 91.6 per cent of patients spent four hours or less from arrival in A&E to being admitted to hospital, transferred or discharged.

The figures revealed performance for the week ending February 15 and is down from 92.9 per cent the previous week - short of the 95 per cent target.

The damning statistics marked the 20th consecutive week that the A&E target has been missed. 

New figures published today by the Health and Social Care Information Centre reveal NHS hospitals in England dealt with 15.5 million admissions in 2013-14.

That figure equates to 42,400 patients being admitted each day - 870 more on average than the previous year.

Those aged 65 to 69 were most likely to be admitted to hospital, and the age group saw the greatest increase in admissions, up 66,000 from the previous year to 1.3 million.

Falls accounted for 421,800 admissions, an increase of 11,000 from 2012-13, with patients aged over 65 most likely to suffer a fall.
