David Cameron showed how deep his support for British Fashion goes – literally - last night at a reception to celebrate the start of the London Collections for Men at Downing Street.

Tieless, in a Richard James suit, Charles Tyrwhitt shirt and Oliver Sweeney shoes, the patriotically attired PM also revealed he was wearing M&S pants.

But it seems shopping is not his strong point, as he admits he instead of being allowed to browse freely, he is instead banished to the changing rooms.

All together now: David Cameron was joined by Dylan Jones, Natalie Massenet, Tom Ford and key figures in the men's fashion world

He said: 'When I go shopping my wife doesn't 
allow me to look around the store at all. I am put in a changing room 
and things are passed to me like you would pass food to a prisoner.'

The London Collections of Men are now in their second year and celebrate the successes of British men’s fashion – a sector that accounts for 50 per cent of the luxury goods market.

This year, London has pulled off something of a coup as big name designers Alexander McQueen and Tom Ford – the latter who attended last night's Downing Street event - will both stage catwalk shows in the capital instead of Milan.

Chatting fashion: The PM chatted enthusiastically to designer Tom Ford ahead of Men's Fashion Week

Celebrating alongside the fashion industry elite last night were singer Tinie Tempah - GQ magazine’s best dressed male of 2012 - and dapper male model David Gandy.

And to show just how deep his commitment to the British fashion industry goes, David Cameron divulged: ‘I go to bed every night with a designer; and wake up every morning with a designer.

'The same one, obviously; my wife Samantha.’

Which doesn’t sound like hard work at all.

Fashion's famous faces: The likes of designer Tommy Hilfiger and Dee Ocleppo attended as well as popstar Tinie Tempah

In numbers: The fashion industry contributes over GBP 37 billion to the UK economy and provides over 816,000 jobs the largest employer of all the creative industries
