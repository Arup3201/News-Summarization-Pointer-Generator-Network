Woody Harrelson's father was a 'hit man' who murdered a Texas carpet saleman and gambler for $1,500, a new book has claimed.

Trial lawyer David Berg says he has unearthed new evidence that proves Charles Harrelson was behind the 1968 slaying of his brother Alan Berg - a murder the actor's father was acquitted of in 1970.

The book, 'Run, Brother, Run' alleges that, after a business dealing that turned 'vicious,' Harrelson was hired by one of the salesman's rivals to knock him off and claims Berg's girlfriend, Sandra Sue Attaway, was used as a honeytrap in the sinister act.

According to The New York Post, Berg writes that Attaway lured his brother to a Houston bar called the Brass Jar.

Then Harrelson forced Berg into his car at gunpoint and told Attaway to drive to a remote location where he shot his alleged victim in the temple then strangled him after he failed to die.

According to Amazon, Berg was only 31 when he disappeared. Six months later his remains were found in a ditch in Texas.

Harrelson was acquitted of Berg's murder due to lack of evidence, but David Berg hasn't stopped looking for answers.

Four decades later, he writes that his family has uncovered new documents including proof Harrelson's alibi was fake and statements from a witness whom Harrelson confessed to, according to The Post.

Berg also says Attaway has outlined each step of the crime she was allegedly an accomplice to in interviews.

Woody Harrelson learned of his dad's dubious profession for the first time at age 12, years after the man had run away leaving his mother to raise him and his two brothers alone.

He told The Guardian in 2012 that he heard his father's name mentioned as a suspect in the assassination of US District Judge John H. Wood Jr. outside of his home in San Antonio, Texas.

'I'm sitting there thinking there can't be another Charles V. Harrelson. I mean, that's my dad! It was a wild realization,' he told the newspaper.

After two years on the run, Harrelson was arrested and admitted not only to Wood's for-hire murder but also claimed he was involved in the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, according to The Post.

Despite his dad's occupation and absence in his life, Woody reconciled with his father in the early 1980s and in later interviews described his love for the man.

Book: David Berg's book apparently unearths new evidence implicating Harrelson in his brother's murder

'If you sit down and rap with the guy, the main thing you're probably going to do is laugh,' Woody said in a 1994 interview, the same year the younger Harrelson starred as a crazed murderer in 'Natural Born Killers.'

And even David Berg describes the assassin as an intelligent man who could also be 'gentle and romantic.'

When his father died of poor health aged 69 in prison in 2007, Woody was said to be 'devastated.'

Before his death, he said in a TV interview: 'How do I feel about him? Well I love him. I definitely love him. Very fond of him. I mean, there's probably a lot of people who should be behind bars. I don't necessarily think he's one of them.'

But Berg disagrees. He describes Harrelson's acquittal as a 'gross miscarriage of justice' and says the book is not about revenge but about setting 'the record straight.'
