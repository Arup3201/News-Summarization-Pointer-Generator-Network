Baltimore Ravens running back Ray Rice arrived Thursday morning to court holding wife Jenay Palmer's hand and pleaded not guilty to assaulting her earlier this year in an Atlantic City casino.

Rice was captured in February on security camera footage dragging his then-fiancÃ©e Janay Palmer's body into an elevator. They have since married despite the Super Bowl champion being charged with third-degree aggravated assault.

He was indicted the day before their wedding for knocking her unconscious.

The not guilty plea came despite prosecutors offering Rice a plea deal that would not involve him serving jail time, the Baltimore Sun reported.

First time offenders in New Jersey are also permitted to enter a diversionary program that would allow him to avoid further court appearances and keep his record clean, the Rutgers alum's lawyers told the paper.

Rice spent hours filling out the paperwork to enter the program despite not yet being given the green light by prosecutors, the paper said. Authorities' blessing is needed to go that route.

He was offered probation an court mandated anger management in his plea deal, and prosecutors did not signal to the paper whether they would allow him to take part in the diversionary program.

'There are guidelines which suggest a crime of violence may be rejected if the prosecutors doesn't consent to the application,' an official said, adding that the offer already made is 'consistent with other plea offers in similar cases.'

The not guilty plea comes only one month after the controversial couple was married.

They had been planning the 
wedding for a couple of weeks, according to TMZ, but news of the 
ceremony drew criticism from fellow American footballers.

Buffalo Bills linebacker Brandon 
Spikes claimed on Twitter the wedding was an attempt by Rice 'to save his image'.

The
 27-year-old was arrested over allegations of domestic violence on 
February 15 after an incident at the Revel Casino and Hotel in New 
Jersey.

If found guilty he could be sentenced to three to five years in prison.

Rice's attorney, Michael
 Diamondstein, described footage of his client dragging Palmer as 
'authentic but incomplete'.

'We
 deny that he committed an aggravated assault. We don't think the law 
would support that [he did]. And we just ask the public to reserve 
judgment until all of the facts are out,' Diamondstein told ESPN.

He added that the couple, who have a young daughter together, were 'happy and in counseling'.

Backing: The Baltimore Ravens have defended Rice, seen here with Janay, and says he will remain on the team

Rice's
 team has also released a statement backing their player, which read: 
'We know there is more to Ray Rice than this one incident.'

Team
 owner Steve Bisciotti added that Rice, who in 2012 signed a five-year 
$35 million contract with the Ravens, will continue to have a future 
there.

The indictment, first reported by the Press of Atlantic City, came after the couple both declined medical treatment at the Revel but security video made the allegations hard to look past.

Diamondstein
 said last month he hoped that after an investigation, 'the matter turns
 out to be little more than a misunderstanding'.

Neither man was immediately able to be reached by Mail Online for comment.
