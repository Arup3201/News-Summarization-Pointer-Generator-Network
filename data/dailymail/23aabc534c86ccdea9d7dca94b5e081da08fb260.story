A topless diner who tested the limits of New York City's recently relaxed attitude towards partial nudity has been pictured with her arms draped around grinning police officers.

Model Cheyenne Lutek was photographed last weekend at Verso Restaurant in Alphabet City exposing her bare breasts while astounded patrons looked on.

Now the model and photographer Allen Henson have upped the ante by taking their X-rated stunt on to the streets of Manhattan on Sunday - encountering two of New York's finest who were more than happy to pose with the glamorous, topless blonde.

Law and order: Model Cheyenne Lutek poses up half-naked with two grinning NYPD cops. It is entirely legal for women to appear in New York City streets partially nude

Henson tweeted: 'A nice stroll on a New York Summer evening. With @Cheyenne_Lutek and a couple of NYC's finest boys in blue.'

In May, the New York City Police Department released an official memo cited by The New York Times 
 informing all police officers that it is not illegal for women to walk 
around the city shirtless, and that they should not be cited for public 
lewdness or indecent exposure.

The
 order given to the city’s 34,000 cops stems from a 1992 New York State 
Court of Appeals, which states that baring one's chest in public is 
legal for a woman as it is for a man.

Miss Lutek and Mr Henson hit a trendy Italian restaurant last weekend where the photographer pulled out his camera and proceeded to snap pictures of the X-rated scene.

This unidentified woman walked into a restaurant, sat down clothed, then too her shirt off while a man snapped photos

Hot spot:  The owner of Verso restaurant in Alphabet City promptly rushed over and asked the woman to put her shirt back on, but she protested she had the law on her side

Verso's owner Labinot Baraliu rushed over the table and demanded that the half-naked woman put her clothes back on.

In response, Miss Lutek insisted that it was 'perfectly legal' to go topless in the restaurant.

'In 15 years [in the restaurant business] I've seen all kinds of things, but not this,' Baraliu explained to  the East Village blog EV Grieve. 'It was funny, but at the same time I was like "WTF — is this really happening?"'

After exchanging a few words with the owner, the couple were escorted out of the bistro.

Despite the legislation because a restaurant is private property, its patrons are subject to whatever rules the business has in place.
