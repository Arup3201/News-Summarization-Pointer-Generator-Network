Charged: Kisha Young, the 38-year-old driver and mother to some of the children, was arrested on suspicion of intoxication assault, a third-degree felony

A Texas woman who didn't want six children to ride inside her car with wet bathing suits is facing charges of intoxication assault after four of them were injured - one seriously.

According to Cowley Police Department, Kisha Young, 39, asked the kids aged between eight and 14 to ride on the trunk and hood of her Chevrolet Malibu for the one-minute journey home after a playdate at the Creekside Community Pool.

Witnesses who saw the unusual sight said that the children were flung from the car at a tight corner and Young kept on driving - apparently unaware that her passengers had come off the vehicle.

Young, the 38-year-old driver and mother to some of the children, was arrested on suspicion of intoxication assault, a third-degree felony.

Additional charges are expected to be sought against Young and the 31-year-old mother of the other children involved, who was a passenger in the front seat, said officer C.C. Meadows, a spokeswoman with the Crowley Police Department.

Crews were dispatched to the 400 block of Angler Drive in the suburb of Crowley in Fort Worth around 8.30 pm.

Incident: The children came off the car at the 400 block of Angler Drive in Crowley, about 15 minutes from downtown Fort Worth, about 8:30 p.m

'Officers were advised that the driver and passenger of the vehicle mothers of the children allowed the children to ride outside the vehicle because their clothes were wet,' police the department stated in a news release to The Star Telegram.

Spokeswoman C.C. Meadows, said that the investigation is trying to determine exactly what caused the children to come off the car, but they suspect alcohol and driver error.

Young was taken into custody after failing a breathalyzer test on the spot - however, they are waiting for the results of her blood tests.

Three of the children were taken to Cook Children's Medical Center.

A 12-year-old girl with a severe head injury - who is Young's daughter - was taken to a Fort Worth Hospital by helicopter.

Playdate: The children were at he Creekside Community Pool, according to police

Short distance: The journey should have taken less than a minute

'It’s my understanding that all have been released with exception to the one who was CareFlited,' Meadows said, who added that the 12-year-old's condition is 'touch and go'.

'Well of course we don't know what they were thinking,' said Meadows. 'However, they weren't thinking safety.'

Neighbor, Demi Garcia told NBCDFW that she saw the accident.

'The mom started backing up after my dad ran over there to the kids. Cause they were trying to lift up the little girl,' she said.

Neighbors said they were shocked by what happened.

'Anybody, they can’t be in their right mind to do that with their own kids!' said Geneva Carpenter, who lives on the street where the incident happened.

'Who in their right mind thinks a little kid can hang on to a hood? You can’t hang onto a hood,' Carpenter said to NBCDFW.

Child Protective Services has been contacted and is expected to investigate.
