President Barack
Obama said Thursday that Republicans are committing political 'suicide' by resisting his push for comprehensive immigration reform, and vowed
to go ahead with plans to unilaterally loosen some immigration rules after the November 4 midterm elections.

Obama wants Republicans in the House of Representatives to call a vote on legislation that passed in the U.S. Senate last year, but any move toward what conservatives see as an 'amnesty' for more than 11 million lawbreakers has been a nonstarter.

'Whatever I do through the executive branch will not be as effective as we could do through legislation,' Obama told a small audience of tech startup entrepreneurs at a town hall-style event in Santa Monica, California. 'And it’s anybody’s guess how Republicans are thinking about this.'

'If they were thinking long-term politically, it is suicide for them not to do this. Because the demographics of the country are such where you are going to lose an entire generation of immigrants who are looking around and saying, "You know what? That party does not seem to care much about me and my life".'

'And I think the smarter Republicans understand this,' Obama jabbed.

'Short term, though,' he claimed, 'they’ve got a problem in the tea party and others who oftentimes express virulently anti-immigrant sentiment.'

The president conceded that 'two or three weeks of publicity' this summer that followed a flood of unaccompanied children and teens across the southern U.S. border 'fanned concern' about the impact of telling the world that America has changed its immigration calculus.

But he insisted that 'it will happen over the next two years.'

'This is going to get fixed,' Obama vowed, 'and Congress will see the light, because the logic of it is – it’s too compelling.'

He explained that while America's native-born population is reproducing at rates comparable to those in Europe and Asia, while first-generation U.S. immigrants are responsible for most of the population growth.

'China is aging. Japan is aging. Europe is aging,' he said. 'We are younger than them. And younger populations grow faster. You have more workers, fewer retirees.'

Obama cited what he said was an economic consensus that if the Senate bill passed in 2013 were to become law, the U.S. would see 'faster growth, lower deficits, a more dynamic economy, more startups.'

The president had been asked a question about a more narrow immigration issue related to limits on the H1B visa program, which high-tech industries want broadened to attract more high-skilled talent from overseas.

Before launching into a political stemwinder, he pledged to make the H1B system more
efficient 'to encourage more folks to stay here.'

But most of Obama's immigration talking points were aimed straight at the GOP, which hopes to expand its House majority and wrest back control of the Senate during what will be Obama's last two years in office.

Shifting the control of just six Senate seats would give Republicans the majority they seek – and create more intense headaches for Obama, who hasn't yet had to deal with a Republican-led Congress united against him.

A Capitol Hill run exclusively by the Republican Party would be a death knell for Obama's immigration policy dreams, Senate aides say.

It would also likely bring new obstacles to implementing the Obamacare medical insurance law, open new levels of scrutiny into a lengthening tally of scandals plaguing the White House, and roll back some of the administration's energy, environmental and homeland security policies.

That outlook, however, depends upon internal dynamics in the GOP that see a hard-line tea party bloc battling against a more moderate majority over whether to risk an electoral backlash by toeing a conservative line.

One senior aide to a western-U.S. Senate Republican told MailOnline on Thursday that immigration 'will be the last thing a Republican-led Senate would ever tackle in the next Congress.'

'I don't care what the go-along, get-along crowd says,' the official said. 'We've been down that road once, and the president never lets us hear the end of it.'

'Sometimes it's better just to let bad ideas die on the vine.'
