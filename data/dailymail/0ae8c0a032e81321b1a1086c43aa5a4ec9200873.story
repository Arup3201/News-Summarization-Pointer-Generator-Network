A social experiment centred around mobile dating app Tinder has attempted to expose online predators in Melbourne seeking to groom underage girls.

Creators of The Tinder Experiment established a fake account for 'Imogen' who initially registers herself as an 18-year-old but explains in her profile that she is in fact 15.

What the three anonymous creators then claim is that many older men aren't deterred by Imogen's age.

In one video, the group say they secretly filmed two men - believed to be aged 31 and 43 - who allegedly met up with Imogen when she told them she was home alone.

The trio - who only wanted to be known as their pseudonyms 'Imogen', 'Blake and 'Jack' - told Daily Mail Australia they conducted the experiment after noticing 'an alarming amount of inappropriate content in the app' which they claim to be 'underage girls, prostitution and trafficking of illicit drugs'.

The series of videos, which were posted online over the last couple of weeks, allegedly document the conversations and following meetings between Imogen and older men on Tinder.

The video shows some men being shocked when they were told by Imogen they were chatting to an underage girl.

But others didn't appear to be fazed.

And even after being confronted and caught by 'Blake' who pretended to be Imogen's older brother in the video before any serious harm could be done, some allegedly kept coming back for more.

It was an experiment which shocked all those involved, including the 21-year-old actress who posed as Imogen.

'I felt vulnerable and disgusted that they thought it was okay to basically throw themselves at a 15-year-old girl,' she told Daily Mail Australia.

'They thought it was completely normal and it just makes me worried for other young girls.'

Actors, 'Blake' and 'Jack' who are both 25, says they originally orchestrated the experiment to raise awareness on 'how easy it is for illegal behavior to take place on mobile dating apps'.

But instead, they were sickened by what unfolded.

'We couldn't believe some of the things that the men said,' Blake told Daily Mail Australia.

'There's a lot we couldn't include in the videos because it was too graphic such as nude pictures. We also couldn't believe that some men came back a second time after being confronted we've had three so far but not all will be shown in the series. You'd think they would learn their lesson after being caught once. Their stupidity was astounding.'

The idea for the project was sparked last year.

'As Tinder users ourselves, we noticed an alarming amount of inappropriate content in the app - underage girls, prostitution, trafficking of illicit drugs - and wanted to gain a greater understanding of the mindset of people participating in such things,' Blake said. 

'I've been on Tinder for over a year now and I've got around 2000 matches on my personal account so I've seen a lot of interesting stuff.

'Girls do some questionable things too... but that's a topic for another day.'

The group started filming the videos in late November and recorded their latest footage on Tuesday night.

Although they fear their cover may be revealed soon and despite receiving some backlash for their risky methods, the group say it was 'worth it'.

'We expected this and honestly, we knew it was dangerous,' Blake said.

'We were all aware of the risk but mutually agreed that it was worth it. Having said that, we had a lot of measures in place in case something went wrong.'

Imogen says she was 'a little nervous at first but I felt safe knowing that I had the other guys on standby'.

'I took part because I wanted to see what would happen and how far they [the Tinder matches] were willing to go with someone that they thought was 15,' she said.

'The guys I worked with were great. I trusted them and was confident that if something went wrong, we could handle it. 

'Plus I'm strong and confident in my abilities to handle situations on my own if I need to.' 

A spokeswoman for Victoria Police told Daily Mail Australia they have been made aware of the video and an investigation will proceed.

'We do not condone the actions shown in this clip and urge anyone with information regarding child exploitation activity to contact Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000,' the spokeswoman said.

Daily Mail Australia has contacted Tinder for comment.
