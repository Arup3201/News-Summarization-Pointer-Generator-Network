Every Price is Right contestant jumps for joy when chosen to ‘come on down,’ but Premal Shah jumped into the crowd's arms and surfed to the stage.

As host Drew Carey called Shah’s name in Friday's episode of the classic game show, the thrilled Stanford grad was lifted in the air by his friends.

Shah was then ushered to the front on a gentle wave of the crowd’s uplifted hands in what is likely the most memorable entrance in the show’s 40 year history.

Video below...

Best 'Come on Down' ever: Premal Shah went on down when his name was called on The Price is Right...with the help of the studio adience 

‘That was an amazing come on down right there,’ said the smiling host.

Shah appeared thrilled as he drifted to his spot on the contestants’ row and even hugged a fellow player once he made it there.

‘That was probably one of the most joyous moments of my life,’ Shah tweeted on Friday.

But that wasn’t the only thrilling moment for the president of a San Francisco non-profit.

Lift off: The Stanford alum was immediately lifted up by his friends when his name was called in the special college-themed Price is Right episode

Awkward: Shah happened to be with former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright when his episode aired and their meeting was 'interrupted by phone blowing up...could not stop grinning'

Just as Shah learned that his episode of The Price is Right was airing, he was meeting with former United States Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.

‘Thoughtful conversation with Secretary Albright this morning interrupted by phone blowing up as Price Is Right aired on East Coast,’ Shah wrote on Facebook. ‘Could not stop grinning.’

Going with the flow: As the crowd erupted in cheers, Premal floated toward the contestants' row on a sea of outstretched hands

School spirit: The special back-to-school episode was dedicated to college students and alum. Premal and his friends sported Stanford shirts

Cushioned: Though the crowd was raucous, they gave Premal a soft landing at the contestants row

Hugs all around: Premal later called the moment the time of his life and it showed as he embraced his fellow players upon landing

First ever: Even host Drew Carey was taken aback. 'That was an amazing come on down right there,' he said
