They have made no secret of their growing love after spending the past few months jet setting around the world together.

And one of Michelle Rodriguez's closest confidants has revealed she is so in love with British supermodel Cara Delevingne that she believes she is 'the one' - and wants to start a family with her.

In an exclusive interview with MailOnline, the friend of the Fast and Furious 
star - who has asked to remain unnamed - reveals how Michelle, 35, is so besotted by Cara, 21, that she 
has already told pals she would love a baby with her.

But while the actress is planning her future with Cara - who is 14 years younger than her - we can reveal the Mulberry model’s family is terrified of the influence the wayward star is having on the top model who has become the toast of the fashion industry.

The start of something: Model Cara Delevingne shared a kiss 
with openly bisexual actress Michelle Rodriguez as they sat courtside at the 
New York Knicks game at Madison Square Garden in January.

The
 source, who Michelle regularly confides in, said: 'Michelle comes from
 a broken home and it has a lot to do with why she has found herself in 
trouble again and again throughout her life.

'Constantly,
 she pushes boundaries and has been in trouble with the law, but really 
all of it is because she is desperate to be loved.

'Her mom and dad separated when she was a child and ever since Michelle has been yearning for some stability in her life.

'Sadly after years of dating older women and men like Olivier Martinez, nothing seemed to work out for her.

'But now Cara has come along, who is so much younger than the women she normally dates, but suddenly Michelle is happy again.'

In
 recent years, former Lost star Michelle, who openly admits she is bisexual, has endured a string of broken relationships after dating French heartthrob and S.W.A.T co-star Olivier Martinez, Fast and Furious co-star Vin Diesel as well as model Claudette Lali, director Francesca De Sola and 
model Aleksandra Rastovic.

The source claims Michelle had a 'great thing' going with Terminator 3 actress Kristanna Loken - who strongly hinted to Advocate magazine that she was in a relationship with her in 2006, yet Michelle has never confirmed their relationship.

'Kristanna wanted to come out as a couple. She's proud to be bisexual, but Michelle wasn't ready to go public,' said the friend: 'So instead of working it out, Michelle ended it.

'Then she was left heartbroken a year later when she fell for another model/actress only to find out she had slept with someone else while she was away filming the movie Avatar.'

The actress has also found herself behind bars after being in trouble repeatedly with the 
law.

In March 2002, she was 
charged with assault and harassment when her girlfriend, Louise Ward, 
claimed the tough girl had attacked her in their New Jersey apartment.

Ward was left battered and bruised, but later dropped all charges against Michelle.

The friend said: 'Michelle can be intense and dive head first into 
romances. This can land her in hot water as she found out with Louise.

'Over the last 15-years there have been countless other examples of her disastrous love life.'

Just one year later Michelle found herself in trouble again when she 
appeared in court to face eight misdemeanor charges relating to two 
driving incidents, including a DUI and a hit and run. 

In
 2004, she pleaded no contest to three of the charges, hit and run, 
drunken driving and driving with a suspended license and went to jail 
for 48 hours and was placed on probation for three years.

And in 2005, while filming ABC hit Lost in Hawaii, the stunning brunette was fined multiple times for speeding.

Later
 that year on December 1st she was arrested for drunk driving, to which 
she pleaded guilty and paid a $500 fine and spent five days in jail.

Due
 to this being a clear violation of her earlier drunk driving crimes, 
she was also sentenced to 60 days in jail, but due to overcrowding was 
released on the same day she entered.

And it's precisely this behavior that has left Cara's family a little fearful.

Michelle's close friend admitted: 'She's a very free spirit and before this relationship she has always been terrified of commitment.

“And because of her troubled past, many of them have essentially had to be her babysitter or a mother figure to her.

'So now Cara might be younger than her, but she honestly thinks this is 'the one'. Just before she met Cara she was talking about wanting a family within the next couple of years.

'She
 really wants a baby and wants one soon and now she has found Cara she 
thinks this could finally be the time to chase that dream.

'Sadly due to Michelle’s troubled past, Cara’s family are not so sure.They are not 100 per cent pro this relationship and are in some ways willing it to end.

'The 14-year age gap between the girls concerns them as does Michelle's wayward reputation.

'They
 know Cara has been swept off her feet by Michelle, who has dropped 
everything to be with her young love, but the family fear the 
relationship will end in nothing but disaster.

'I highly doubt at 21-years-old Cara is ready to start a family. She is no doubt currently smitten with Michelle, who dropped everything, including her girlfriend and friends, to be with her.

'But
 if anyone is going to get their heart broken in this relationship it's 
going to be Michelle. She will smother Cara, and wants to be around her 
24 hours a day.'

The couple, who apparently met in 
January, were also seen attending Prince's secret gig at Ronnie Scott's 
club on Monday, February 17, and the Elle Style Awards the following 
evening before heading to Milan to 
close the autumn/winter fashion season.

They then hired a private jet last week to head to Milan Fashion Week, where Cara had a busy schedule. The pair were spotted in coordinating black outfits while carrying bags as they made their way to their airplane - while the Brit beauty's parents were also along for the trip.

After landing in Milan, Michelle sat with her love as she sat in hair and makeup backstage at the Fendi autumn/winter 2014 fashion show. They then flew back to London and are now believed to be on vacation.

Sexy couple: Michelle's post came days after Cara shared this snapshot

Michelle spoke openly about her sexuality in October after years of speculation, telling Entertainment Weekly, 'I've never walked the carpet with anyone, so they wonder: What does she do with her vagina?" Plus, I play a butchy girl all the time, so they assume I'm a lesbo.'

Asked about the assumptions, she admitted: 'Eh, they're not too far off. I've gone both ways. I do as I please. I am too f--king curious to sit here and not try when I can. Men are intriguing. So are chicks.'

This week, Michelle posted a picture of herself naked, revealing her bare derriere to the world as she appeared to be meditating.

She was seen lapping up the sunshine in Thailand, where she is 
currently enjoying a getaway, and the snapshot also showed a stunning 
ocean view.

And it is likely that the photo was taken by Cara, as that same day the model shared a picture of herself clad 
in scuba diving gear in an equally tropical location.

Michelle’s snap comes just days after her model squeeze shared her own extremely sexy picture on the social networking site.

The source added: 'You can see from the photos of them out together in London that they are clearly having fun.

'They
 don't seem to have a care in the world and I know Michelle will pay for
 everything, go everywhere with her and has unlimited funds to do as 
they please.

'To begin with
 this will be nice and she will be flattered. But when she has to go 
away to shoot a film, it will end and Michelle does fall hard.

'And maybe it will all be a little too much for someone as young as Cara.'
