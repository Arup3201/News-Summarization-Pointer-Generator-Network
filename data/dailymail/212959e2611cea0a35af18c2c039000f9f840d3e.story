Police have arrested a man in connection with arson attacks on four mobile phone and local radio transmission masts last week – the latest in a wave of attacks apparently perpetrated by a group or individual dubbed the ‘Bristol Unabomber’.

The Mail on Sunday revealed two weeks ago that an ‘eco-terrorist’ anarchist group calling itself the Earth Liberation Front/Informal Anarchist Federation has claimed responsibility for about 50 attacks in the Bristol area over the past four years.

They include earlier burnings of phone masts and vehicles belonging to local politicians and government agencies, the disabling of signal cables on two railway lines and the complete destruction by fire ten months ago of the Avon and Somerset Police firearms training centre, at a cost of £18million.

Each time those responsible have struck, they have issued statements on the ‘Indymedia’ and ‘325.nostate’ websites, justifying their actions as part of a war on the British state and capitalist society.

The attacks last Monday night on masts serving the O2, Vodafone, T-mobile and EE networks conformed to the usual pattern.

According to the anarchists’ statement, they were timed to coincide with the World Cup, ‘to show our complicity with the insurgent fighters in Brazil as they answer massive dispossession and militarised slum clearances for the opulence of the games with street battles and arson’.

The statement added: ‘It should be remembered that the enthralling spectacle… is staged to make the rich yet more money and to distract us from our daily humiliations.’

Police said the four attacks were probably linked, and that a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of four counts of arson. He was released on police bail while inquiries continue.
