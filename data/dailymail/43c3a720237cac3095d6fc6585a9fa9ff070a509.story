The Breeders’ Cup meeting at Santa Anita in November is a possible target for Jamie Osborne’s Toast of New York after the colt put in what his trainer believes was a career-best effort to finish second to Shared Belief in the Pacific Classic at Del Mar in California.

The three-year-old colt, owned by Michael Buckley, got to within two and three-quarters of a length of the Jerry Hollendorfer-trained winner to justify the decision of connections to return to America.

Toast Of New York was the brilliant winner of the UAE Derby in March but had since slightly disappointed at Belmont Park in July.

Target: Jamie Osborne’s Toast of New York will look towards the Breeders' Cup in November

Osborne said: ‘I’d say, probably, he's run the race of his life. He stepped up the form from winning the UAE Derby. This is probably his best performance and, sadly for us, he's just bumped into an exceptional three-year-old.

‘He'll improve a bit more. I'm very proud of him - he's run a great race. From now on he's going to have to try something different, but he's proved he's a very good horse.’

Plans remain fluid for Toast Of New York, who was ridden at Del Mar by Victor Espinoza, although the Dubai World Cup in March next year remains a long-term objective.

Osborne said: ‘We've all sorts of ideas. The Dubai World Cup is obviously a massive target for next year, but I'll have to talk to Michael.

‘Do we try him on dirt beforehand? Do we bring him to the Breeders' Cup? There's all sort of options, but he's only three with a big future and maybe he can come back here (California).

Victory: Shared Belief with jockey Mike Smith wins the TVG Pacific Classic on Sunday

‘There's no reason to think he won't go on Dirt. If he does, just think of the fun we could have with him.’

Shared Belief was the leading two-year-old in America last season but missed this year's Triple Crown races with a foot injury.

He is now set for a possible showdown with Kentucky Derby and Preakness winner California Chrome in the Breeders' Cup Classic on November 1.

Jockey Mike Smith said: 'He's a special horse. I heard someone say this might be the coming out of a superstar. I think now this horse deserves that accolade.’
