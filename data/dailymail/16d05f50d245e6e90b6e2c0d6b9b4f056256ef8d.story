A fashion staple of the Eighties, the jumpsuit has made a mega comeback onto the catwalks and red carpets of late.

Teaming comfort and practicality with all manner of fashion possibilities from demure cover up to structural statement, the jumpsuit trend seems set to stay.

It may hark back to the days of David Bowie and even Elvis, but celebrities have been embracing the jumpsuit in a big way during the award season ... to varying degrees of success.

Jumpsuit super fan Miley wore another all-in-one number to the Billboard Music Awards featuring cut out lace panels

Kate Moss stepped out in London wearing a grey jumpsuit on Thursday channeling workman chic

Solange Knowles stood out from the crowd when she stepped out in a startling white jumpsuit that boasted ruffled and spherical detailing around the neckline and arms

The recent Billboard Music Awards saw celebrities embracing the trend in many different styles: Miley Cyrus made a dramatic entrance on the blue carpet wearing a Balmain crocheted jumpsuit featuring a harlequin diamond design.

Castle actress Stana Katic took the plunge in a white pantsuit, while Mistresses star Alyssa Milano flaunted her pins in a sheer, flared style.

Undisputed queen of fashion Kate Moss joined the latest A-list craze earlier this month when she managed to make a boiler suit look cool, not once but twice (she slipped in to her Stella McCartney design to run errands in the day as well as teaming it with a fur coat for a night on the town).

Jumpsuit super fan Miley Cyrus appeared every inch the victor as she strutted into Maxim's 2013 Hot 100 Party to collect her award as the hottest female in a black and white Valentino all-in one teamed with metallic Saint Laurent platform heels.

The Can't Be Tamed star glowed in the black suit, which featured a white band around the bust and a bow between her shoulder blades.

Proving the jumpsuits current popularity, the same jumpsuit was also worn by fashion queen Gwyneth Paltrow and Girls star Lena Dunham.

Beyonce’s little sister Solange Knowles has also recently stepped out in a jumpsuit, showing how to use the all-in-one to make a real fashion statement.

The 26-year-old singer wore a snow white jumpsuit with rouched and spherical detailing around the neckline and down the sleeves for a party at Cannes.

While the garment nipped her in at the waist it fell down to wide-legged trousers, flattering Solange's slim shape.

Once Upon A Time co-stars Ginnifer Goodwin and Josh Dallas cut a stylish couple at the Disney Media Networks International Upfrontswith Ginnifer showing how to wear the jumpsuit in a demure and chic way

Ginnifer Goodwin covered up in a black and white jumpsuit when she attended the Disney Media Networks International Upfronts on the Disney Lot in Burbank, California on Sunday demonstrating how the high fashion trend can also be smart and sensible.

She teamed her cropped jumpsuit with a chic black jacket and heels in a look that would work for the office as well as the red carpet.

Singer Nayer brought her dog Handsome and wore a hooded onesie that put everything on display at the 2013 Billboard Music Awards on Sunday night in Las Vegas

And at the opposite end of the all-in-one style spectrum singer Nayer, who rose to fame singing on Pitbull and Ne-Yo's ‘Give Me Everything’ showed how NOT to wear the jumpsuit on a red carpet at this year’s Billboard Music Awards.

In what appeared to be a cry for attention, the 25-year-old squeezed into a revealing tight black-and-white printed outfit featuring a hood that also worked as a top and a metallic belt.
