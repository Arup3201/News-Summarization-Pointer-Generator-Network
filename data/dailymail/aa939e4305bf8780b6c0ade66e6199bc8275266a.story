When burglar Wayne Bishop argued last year that prison was breaching his human right to be with his five children, he was controversially awarded his freedom.

However, in a move that will be applauded as a victory for common sense, the thug’s astonishing attempt to use the same excuse to beat a new jail term ended with him being firmly put behind bars.

Judge Michael Stokes condemned the 34-year-old’s cynical exploitation of the European human rights legislation to try to avoid punishment.

Jailing him for eight months for a 
brutal assault – committed just three weeks after his earlier release – 
he said: ‘I am afraid, Mr Bishop, you have to learn that other people 
have rights apart from you.

‘We all have the right not to have 
our homes and premises burgled. We all have the right to walk the 
streets without fear of being attacked.

‘The rights that are set out by the 
European Convention on Human Rights are not to be produced like the ace 
of trumps to avoid a prison sentence.’

The judge noted that it was jobless Bishop’s 17th court appearance.

His 
previous convictions stretch back more than a decade and include a 
previous assault and two convictions for threatening behaviour.

The shaven-headed burglar, wearing a hooded top and padded 
jacket, waved to relatives and supporters as he was led away at 
Nottingham Crown Court.

It is thought his five children – Courteney, 13, Katie, 12, Taylor, ten,
Brandon, eight, and Kyle, seven – will now be cared for by his sister, 
Sherrie McKinley, who has six children of her own

After the hearing, Mrs McKinley blamed their jailbird father Phillip Wheelhouse for her brother’s life of crime.
In a statement, read outside court by her daughter Jade, she said: 
‘Perhaps, if as children, we had had the right upbringing and guidance, 
instead of our father being in and out of jail all of our childhood 
life, Wayne would have been able to think before his actions.
‘Instead he follows our father’s footsteps.’

Mr Wheelhouse, 60, had insisted in an interview last month that his son 
had been ‘brought up proper’ – but deserved to go to jail.

‘He should do the time for the first thing and then this time on top, to teach him he can’t get away with it,’ he said.

Last April, Bishop, of Clifton, Nottingham, was jailed for eight months 
after admitting a burglary at Mansfield rugby club and an offence of 
dangerous driving.

He was released the following month after successfully arguing that the 
judgment was a breach of his human rights and not enough consideration 
had been given to the fact he cared for his children.

Judges ruled Bishop had a ‘human right’ to a family life – and replaced his jail term with a suspended sentence and curfew.

After his release, the shameless burglar told journalists: ‘All those 
people giving it a bad reaction need to think about single parents. The 
benefits agency won’t help me get a job.’ He even appeared on ITV’s 
Daybreak programme to argue that the public ‘needed to understand his 
situation’.

When asked if he would re-offend, Bishop insisted he was ‘going straight’ for the sake of his children.

Yet just three weeks later he attacked a man in broad daylight after 
chasing him into a Spar supermarket in Broxtowe, Nottinghamshire.

Bishop repeatedly punched the man in the head while his brother, Robert Wheelhouse, held him in a headlock.

The pair at first denied the assault, but were found guilty after the court was shown damning CCTV footage of the incident.

Bishop’s brother was given a three-month curfew and ordered to wear an electronic tag.
