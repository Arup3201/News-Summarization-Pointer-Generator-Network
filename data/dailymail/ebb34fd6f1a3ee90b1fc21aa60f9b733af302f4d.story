A mother-of-one who has already given away a kidney, eggs and part of her liver to complete strangers is now trying to donate a lung.

Sue Gianstefani, 47, gave her kidney to an elderly man in the US, her eggs to a childless couple in Australia, and part of her liver to a 12-year-old in the UK.

Now the mother-of-one is trying to give away her lung, and insists husband Roland, 51, and 19-year-old son Daniel support her all the way.

Despite risking infection, bleeding, blood clots and death, Mrs Gianstefani insists husband Roland, 51 (pictured), and 19-year-old son Daniel stand behind her decisions

Her obsession with organ donation began in 2001 when she posted an advert online offering to give away a kidney in return for travel and living expenses.

The ad read: 'Free kidney, no strings attached.'

Mrs Gianstefani's first donation was to American Larry Rosenfield (pictured) who was dying of a genetic kidney disease

Larry Rosenfield, from the US, replied. The 60-year-old said he was dying from a genetic kidney disorder, was already on dialysis, and that time was running out.

After establishing that she was a match, Sue flew to the US for the operation.

She told the Daily Mirror: 'You don't need two kidneys, a lot of people are born with only one. Why not give one to someone who needs it?'

Mr Rosenfield, from Colorado, had to fly to Wisconsin with Mrs Gianstefani for the operation after surgeons in his home state refused to carry out the procedure.

But following the operation Mr Rosenfield is now 73 and living an active life.

After hearing about the generous kidney donation, a childless couple in Australia got hold of Mrs Gianstefani to ask if she would consider donating some eggs to them for IVF treatment.

She donated 27 eggs, and managed to find out that three had been fertilised before losing touch with the couple.

To this day she has no idea if the pair ever managed to have children using her eggs.

Mrs Gianstefani was forced to go abroad to make all of her donations as altruistic donation was illegal in the UK until 2006 amid fears that people could be coerced into giving.

In December last year Mrs Gianstefani (in bed) donated part of her liver to a 12-year-old in the UK (pictured at Kings Hospital alongside husband Roland)

But after the law changed Mrs Gianstefani contacted the NHS, saying she wanted to donate a part of her liver.

In December last year Kings Hospital got in touch to say they had a little boy close to death who was in need of a liver.

She added: 'I don't know who he is but he's doing well and started nursery in April.'

Mrs Gianstefani says she donates to give other people a chance at life, but by undergoing so many surgeries, she is risking her own

Altruistic organ donation used to be illegal in the UK until 2006, as it was feared that donors could be forced into donating or do it for money.

But now increasing numbers of altruistic donors - meaning donors from outside the immediate family of the patient - are coming forward to give away their organs.

Living donation is major surgery, and comes with all the risks associated with any other operation - including infection, bleeding, blood clots and death.

Some operations are riskier than others. Living kidney donations are relatively safe, with donors having a 1 in 3,000 chance of dying from the surgery.

Common complications include protein in urine and high blood pressure.

However for liver donation, the risks are much greater. Donors can suffer abdominal bleeding, bile leakage, bowel obstructions and kidney failure.

For lung patients, the risks are higher still. Surgery can cause a fistula - a type of abscess - between the lung and its outer wall which can lead to air leaking out.

Another potential risk is ventricular fibrillation arrest, a type of cardiac arrest, which can lead to sudden death.
