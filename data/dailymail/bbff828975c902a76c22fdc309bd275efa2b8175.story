A fast food 'superhero' who delivers McDonald's to customers has won a battle with the fast food chain to be allowed inside their restaurants.

Paul Appleby - who goes by the name 'Munchie Man' - launched a new business taking orders for McDonald's customers who don't want to pick it up for themselves.

The 41-year-old from Barnsley, South Yorkshire, delivers it to to his customers - who pay £4.50 for the service - in his 'Munchies Van' which has equipment inside to keep the food warm.

To the rescue: Munchie Man Paul Appleby delivers McDonald's to customers who don't want to collect it

Paul managed 45 successful deliveries on his first weekend before he got banned from McDonald's - who said they had concerns over food safety.

Paul said: 'We were really busy on the Friday and Saturday night, until McDonald's just stopped serving us. They wouldn't let us in.'

McDonalds has issued a statement saying the firm had looked into running its own delivery service but decided against it because it would mean the quality of the food would suffer.

A McDonald's spokesperson said: 'We found that a delivery service would not be able to adequately meet our quality commitment to serving hot, freshly prepared food every time to off-site locations.

'We are therefore not in a position to support other delivery ventures in the UK as we could not guarantee this quality commitment to our customers.' 

McDonald's in Barnsley tried to stop Paul from delivering his orders by refusing to serve him - but have now relented him

The statement also said it would refuse to give licence for the use on McDonald's 'intellectual property' such as logos and photographs.

But after Paul pleaded with them, McDonald's saying he is now welcome to use the Barnsley outlets.

Paul said 'They've said I'm welcome in all their restaurants, so I'm hoping this can really grow now. I want a Munchies Van every ten miles.'

Customers can order and pay for their food on Munchie Man's website then Paul goes to buy it and delivers it to the customer - adding a delivery charge of £4.50.

The ultimate fast food: Customers don't even have to leave their homes to get fast-food

Paul said he has spent £5,000 setting up the delivery business and website.

The food is placed in a specially designed heat bag at the restaurant - it is then placed into an insulated heated area within his van, and handed to the customer.

Paul said: 'It's kept above 63 degrees - which is the required temperature. Comments from customers are that it's hotter than when you pick it up yourself.

'I never handle the food, but I've done my basic food hygiene certificate anyway.'

He hopes to add other outlets to his website and has already agreed to deliver breakfasts for Bailey's Coffee Shop in his local market.

He is currently banned from KFC, but is still in talks with the chain and hopes to resolve it soon.
