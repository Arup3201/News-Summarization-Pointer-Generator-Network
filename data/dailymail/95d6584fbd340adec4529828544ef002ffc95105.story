We may be out of January but keep your scarves and overcoats handy – winter shows no sign of loosening its grip.

Arctic gales will blow into the country this week, bringing icy conditions and snow showers.

Temperatures will fall to -4C (25F) by midweek but 70mph northwesterly winds will make it feel like -12C (10F).

All parts of the UK can expect at least some snow, with significant falls expected over higher ground in northern England and Scotland, getting heavier by Wednesday.

Forecaster Tony Conlan, of MeteoGroup, said: ‘It will be largely sunny and dry on Monday, particularly in the south of England. But for the rest of the week the whole of the UK will be very cold and windy.’

The Met Office issued a weather alert predicting a 70 per cent chance that winds will bring icy conditions and snow to England tomorrow.

Taking into account the wind chill, it could feel as cold as -5C (23F) during daylight hours on Tuesday and a bitter -12C on Wednesday evening.

But forecasters stressed there is unlikely to be a repeat of the heavy snowfall seen last month which brought travel chaos.

Mr Conlan added: ‘Just about anywhere in the country could get a dusting of snow at some point.

‘The winds will be strongest on Monday and Tuesday, with gusts of up to 70mph in Scotland, which will get a real buffeting with some significant snow.

‘On Tuesday it will be very windy down the west coast, from north-west Scotland down to Cornwall, with gusts of 60mph. The wind chill will mean it will feel really very cold.’

Meanwhile, forecaster Tony Conlan, of MeteoGroup, said: ‘On Wednesday we are going to get a cold northerly with frequent wintry showers on the east coast.

‘Across the country there will be wintry conditions, with periods of snow in north-west Scotland and wintry showers on the east coast later in the week with a cold wind developing and overnight frosts.'

And as the flood clear-up continued, 
there were nine areas remaining with Environment Agency flood warnings 
as of 4pm on Sunday, with 63 lower-level flood alerts still in place.
