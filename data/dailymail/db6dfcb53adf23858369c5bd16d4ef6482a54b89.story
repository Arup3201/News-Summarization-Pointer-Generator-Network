Cristiano Ronaldo seems to have gotten over Portugal's elimination from the World Cup - by spending time with his Russian model girlfriend Irina Shayk.

The Real Madrid forward could not prevent Portugal from being eliminated during the group stages in Brazil, but it has allowed him to spend some precious time with the gorgeous Shayk.

Shayk posted a selfie of the pair on Instagram as Ronaldo relaxes before pre-season training.
