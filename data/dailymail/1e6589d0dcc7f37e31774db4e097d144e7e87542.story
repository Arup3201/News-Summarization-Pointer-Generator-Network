The Italian city of Venice has finally made it onto Google Street View – despite being built on water.

Google has finally overcome the obstacle of capturing a city with no streets after strapping 360° cameras to employees who have travelled around Venice on foot.

Normally, Google Street View images are taken by a specially equipped car, but in the case of the popular Italian destination, extreme measures had to be taken.

Employees have made their across Venice’s piazzas and narrow walkways wearing backpacks containing the 33lbs cameras, and images should be available sometime later this year.

The cameras, named The Trekker, have been used by Google to capture places only available by foot, such as the Burj Khalifa in Dubai.

Google street view was launched in May 2007, and was only available in five American cities; San Francisco, Denver, Las Vegas, Miami and New York City.

Launched in 2007, Google Street View originally covered San Francisco, Denver, Las Vegas, Miami and New York City.

It now shows locations in 50 countries around the world - a number which keeps growing.

After conquering America, Street View landed in Europe in 2008 in Italy and France.

As it spreads around the world, some locations are proving more difficult than others.

Svalbard in the Arctic Ocean had to be captured by snow mobile and although Nepal can be seen on the map, only mountain landmarks via satellite are available.

The Google Street View Car uses nine directional cameras for 360° views at a height of about 8.2 feet, or 2.5 meters, and the images are then 'stitched' together, creating the panorama effect.

In addition to the Street View cars and The Trekker, Google uses tricycles, trolleys and snowmobiles when faced with difficult terrains where the cars cannot reach.

The Google Trikes, photographs pedestrian-only areas of cities and towns across the globe to capture the streets of the nearly 50 countries now available on Street View.

The Snowmobile was invented for the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver and several mountainsides are now available on Google Maps.

Street View vehicles are currently in place in Bangladesh, Peru and Swaziland and is rumoured to be on tour in Serbia.
