They look like a row of Hobbit holes but these inventive rooms at a hotel in the Netherlands are in fact giant wine barrels.

The Hotel de Vrouwe van Stavoren has installed four 15,000-litre capacity dark wooden vats in its backyard, giving the term B&B a new meaning - booze & bed.

Toast of the town: The rooms look like Hobbit holes but are in fact giant wine barrels from Switzerland

Each of the huge barrels has been extended out into three rooms - a bedroom, sitting room and bathroom.

The novelty rooms have been decorated with red carpets and curtains - the same colour as the wine they used to house.

They have been completely refurbished to fit in beds, a shower, toilet, mini-bar, TV and - of course - a bottle of red wine on arrival.

The barrels were imported to the guesthouse in north-west Netherlands from Switzerland in 1981 and eight larger ones are to be brought from France next year.

These new casks will be nearly 50 per cent bigger again as they can hold up to a staggering 22,000 litres.

Overlooking the picturesque old harbour of Stavoren, the B&B enjoys stunning views of the huge artificial Lake IJsselmeer and the wooden ships that are moored there.

It also boasts a restaurant specialising in dishes using local fish and is surrounded by beautiful bright red and pastel pink flowers.

Stavoren used to be the most powerful city in Friesland due to its strategic proximity to the North Sea, meaning it benefited from booming overseas trade.

Now, its lakeside location means the village is a thriving hotspot for aquatic sports holidays and modern yacht centres.
