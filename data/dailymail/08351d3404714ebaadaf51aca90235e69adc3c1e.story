This strip club may be located at one of the world's most beautiful travel destinations, but it appears to have been mysteriously abandoned by its once regular clientele.

Perhaps its venue - several feet below water level - was just too off-putting.

The Nymphas Show Bar, which still features a stripper's pole, was re-discovered by photographer Gil Koplovitz during a dive off the coast of Eilat in Israel.

It has been described as the world's 
most bizarre nude dancing club, but even Koplovitz is unsure how long 
the club has been lying underwater, empty.

He told The Huffington Post: 'The entrance [to the strip joint] is 
above water. People just crossed a 230ft bridge and
went down a flight of stairs. No need to get wet.'

But while the club has lost its attraction, Koplovitz's pictures have caught people's imagination, capturing the eerie beauty of modern day ruins.

The pole in the centre of the picture is the only thing left which hints at the club's past as a strip joint - it used to be an underwater restaurant

The scene is called 'Abandoned Porn' 
and his photos have left many people more intrigued than they would be 
by images of an ordinary strip club.

Taken through the windows of the rusted destination, they show the once glossy, pristine interior.

Chairs and most of the tables have been removed, but the stage and the pole remain. An empty bottle of mineral water has been left on one of the few remaining pieces of furniture.

The only ones showing any interest in the club now are the fish having a peek through the windows as they swim past.
