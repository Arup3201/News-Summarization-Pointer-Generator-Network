Bill Pertee was known for his role as the air raid warden Hodges in the 1970s comedy Dad's Army

As stroppy air raid warden Mr Hodges, he was the scourge of Captain Mainwaring and his bumbling Home Guard platoon.

Seldom did an episode of Dad’s Army go by without the officious character in the white tin hat trying to sabotage their efforts or ordering all and sundry to: ‘Put that light out!’

Yesterday the light went out for ever on Bill Pertwee, the actor who played Hodges as a man on the edge of hysteria during his frequent clashes with the Walmington-on-Sea troop in the church hall they were forced to share as a base.

Pertwee, 86, appeared in 60 of the 80 episodes of the much-loved BBC comedy, which ran for nine series from 1968 to 1977 and is still being repeated now.

His death means that the only surviving cast members are Ian Lavender, 67, who played ‘stupid boy’ Private Pike, and 81-year-old Frank Williams, who was the vicar the Rev Farthing.

Pertwee had been ill over Christmas and was living in a residential home in Wadebridge, Cornwall.

He was airlifted to hospital and died in the early hours of yesterday with his family at his bedside. Marion McLeod, his wife of 45 years, died on the same date in 2005.

Pertwee became involved in showbusiness in 1954 by helping his cousin Jon Pertwee, who later starred in Doctor Who, when he was on tour performing a seaside variety show.

A talented mimic as well as an actor,
he appeared in three Carry On films, had a long career in theatre and 
TV, and was in more than 1,000 radio broadcasts for BBC comedy shows 
including Beyond Our Ken and Round The Horne.

But it was the role of Bert Hodges, 
the greengrocer with dirty fingernails who seemed to have let the power 
of being an air raid warden go to his head, for which he is best 
remembered.

He was president of the Dad’s Army 
Appreciation Society and yesterday his son Jonathan told how his father 
had a continued affection for the sitcom and his co-stars including 
Arthur Lowe as Mainwaring, John Le Mesurier as Sergeant Wilson and Clive
Dunn as Lance Corporal Jones.

‘He loved it. He loved the people in 
it, it was a big part of his life and he used to have a lot of fun with 
Clive Dunn and John Le Mesurier and Frank Williams and all of them. They
just had a great bod,’ he said.

Paying tribute to his father, he 
added: ‘He would give everything a go. He was very dedicated to the 
people around him and he was very dedicated to his charity work.

'But also he was very humble about 
the whole thing. He’d say, “Marvellous, isn’t it, to be in this 
business”, because he said, “I’m not really a proper actor”, but he was 
extraordinarily versatile.’

In 2007 he received an MBE for his charitable services in supporting children’s hospices.

Arthur Lowe died in 1982 aged 66, and John Le Mesurier the following year aged 71. Clive Dunn died at the age of 92 last year.
