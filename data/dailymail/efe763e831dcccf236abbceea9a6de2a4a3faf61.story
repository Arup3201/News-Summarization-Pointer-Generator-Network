The skyline above the ancient city of Marseille burst into flame yesterday.

But far from being some terrible disaster, the dramatic scene was actually a carefully orchestrated stunt by artistic collective Carabosse Company.

The French group, which specialises in creating 'fire gardens', lit more than 6,000 small fires contained in buckets which were fixed to giant sculptures around the city's Old Harbour.

The display was part of Marseille's cultural celebrations as it is the 2013 European Capital of Culture.

The city's Old Harbour is illuminated by more than 6,000 pots of fire beneath the imposing figure of the Notre-Dame de la Garde Basilica

The event was put on as part of the Marseille-Provence 2013 cultural celebrations

The two-day display started last night and will take place again tonight, but with a different arrangement of sculptures.

Carabosse named the event Le Vieux Port: entre flammes et flots - meaning The Old Harbour: between flames and waves.

Marseille is France's second-largest city after Paris and is thought to be the country's oldest, with remains showing humans settled in the region around 30,000 years ago.

The Old Harbour area has been recently redeveloped, but architectural remains show it may date back to Ancient Greek times.

The free event was open to families and there appeared to be little restrictions stopping members of the public from getting up close to the flames.

Thousands of buckets containing small fires were fixed to metal sculptures, set floating in the quays and hung from bridges.

One sculpture was a series of arches of flame, which created a 300m-long tunnel visitors could walk through. The largest sculpture reached 35m into the air.

Pedestrians were able to walk freely through the installation in Marseille's streets

Marseille, in the south of France, came alive with light during the evening

Local media estimated between 180,000 and 200,000 people came to view the display last night.

Jean-Francois Chougnet, director 
general of Marseille Provence 2013, said crowds enjoyed a 'friendly 
atmosphere' and that there were no incidents like injuries or arrests.

The flames were lit at 8.30pm by 60 members of the company dubbed 'flame lighters'.

The artistic collective has previously put on displays in the UK, including at Brighton, Milton Keynes and Stonehenge

Marseille is twinned with the Slovakian city of Košice as European Capital of Culture 2013.

The two cities replace Guimarães, in Portugal, and Maribor, in Slovenia, which were the culture capitals in 2012.

The accolade was initiated in 1985 with the aim of bringing Europeans closer together by celebrating culture.

It provides cities with the opportunity to spend a year focusing on a high-profile arts and culture programme, which brings knock-on economic boosts to the region.

Athens was the first capital of culture. Since 2000, more than one city has been able to hold the title at once.
