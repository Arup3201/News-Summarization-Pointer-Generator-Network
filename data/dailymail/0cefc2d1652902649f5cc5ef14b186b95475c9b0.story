Pub regulars are to be given the 
chance to buy and run their local as David Cameron unveiled a 
£250million fund to stop community facilities closing down.

The Prime Minister said he wanted local people to be able to own shops, village halls, playing fields and even swimming pools.

Mr
 Cameron insisted he had not given up on his often-mocked Big Society 
vision, and vowed to ‘fight’ opponents who refused to back him.

Cheers: David Cameron, pictured leaving outside Number 10 today with comedian David Walliams and the Enough Food for Everyone IF campaign, used a speech to announce £250million to buy shops and pubs by 2020

Money from dormant bank accounts has helped to swell the coffers of Big Society Capital which is bankrolling the idea for a decade, with funding from the Big Lottery Fund.

In a speech on social investment funds, Mr Cameron said £250million would be available until 2020 to ‘help communities with ambitions to own local assets like pubs, shops, community centres and affordable housing’.

The money – paid out in grants or loans – will help people in towns, villages and cities to buy and run facilities which are no longer financially viable as a business.

Some of the money from the lottery fund will go into grants to support projects which cannot be expected to turn a profit.

But £50 million of the money will go into a community asset fund to provide grants and loans to help get projects off the ground which could go on to be commercially viable over the long term.

Mr Cameron said: ‘Everyone knows how vital institutions in our towns and villages are, like village halls, playing fields, local pubs.

‘And everyone knows how - despite the best efforts of parish and local councils - these can face closure.’

Dream: Pub locals would be able to run their local if it closes down while residents could buy playing fields to stop them being developed

He insisted that using public money to help people to take over and run pubs and shops was not ‘some pipe dream’.

‘Already there are 311 community-owned shops,18 community-owned pubs, as well as community owned bookshops, cafes, swimming pools, bakers, farmers markets, even community owned broadband networks,’ he added.

He highlighted Fenham Swimming pool in Newcastle, which was closed by Newcastle City Council in 2003. It was saved by a community group but it came under financial pressure.

Investment from Big Society Capital meant they were able to install solar panels to heat the pool, reduce their running costs and make it financially viable as a community centre.

Mr Cameron said he hoped that the new funding will mean that ‘projects like this will be possible not in just in one community – but in every community across the country’.

Speaking to a Social Impact Investment Forum staged in London as part of the UK's chairmanship of the G8, Mr Cameron also announced a consultation on new tax breaks for social enterprises.

And he welcomed the launch, supported by the London Stock Exchange, of the world's first social stock exchange, which will showcase social impact businesses and provide a means for potential investors to measure their success.

The Prime Minister launched a staunch defence of the Big Society, which formed the centrepiece of his leadership in opposition but appeared to have been quietly shelved after the financial crash.

Tory strategists have said the focus must be on the economy, immigration and welfare.

But Mr Cameron defied his critics – including many in the Conservative party – to signal that the Big Society will remain a key feature of his premiership.

‘Some people occasionally ask me whether I still believe with the same passion in the vision of building a bigger and stronger society.

I'm absolutely prepared to fight for this. Social investment can be a great force for social change, it can help us to build the bigger and stronger societies we want to see.
