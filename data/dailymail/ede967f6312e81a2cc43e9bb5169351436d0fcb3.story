This dramatic footage shows the moment a cash machine was ripped from a supermarket by a digger. 

The thieves stripped the ATM out of the Co-operative shop in Sapcote, in Leicestershire, which took just 20 seconds. 

They pulled away bricks leaving a gaping hole in the side of the supermarket before loading the stolen ATM on to the back of a Toyota Hi-Lux. The digger was left at the scene.

The raid on the Co-op store was the fourth such attack in Leicestershire in the past few weeks.

Alma Phythian told the Leicester Mercury: 'I was in bed when I heard the loud noise and thought "that's not normal". I knew it was the Co-op.

'When I looked out of the window I saw there was a large hole in the Co-op and a small digger.

'They loaded the machine on to another vehicle and drove away. It was all so fast.

'The police were here within 10 minutes, but the men had long gone.'

Police said it was a 'great concern' thieves are targeting cash machines and urged witnesses to come forward

Detective Constable Stu Palmer, from Leicestershire Police, said: 'It's obviously a great concern to us that thieves are targeting shops and cash machines.

'We are looking at the similarities between all of the reports and there is a strong possibility that the incidents may be linked, but our investigations are very much ongoing to establish whether there is a definite link.

'We would also encourage anyone who sees a digger or JCB type vehicle being driven at unusual times of the day or night to contact the police immediately so we can act appropriately and eliminate any reports from our inquiries.

'If you witnessed the incident in Sapcote or saw either the digger or the Toyota car being driven in the area then please get in touch.

'Even if you think the information you can provide is not significant we would still encourage you to come forward so we can follow up any leads.'  

Anyone with information should contact Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 or ring 101.
