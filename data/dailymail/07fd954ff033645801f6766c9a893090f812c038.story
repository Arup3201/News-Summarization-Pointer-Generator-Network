A California pastor who allegedly used a pair of pliers on a 13-year-old boy's nipple at a group home has pleaded guilty to beating and assault charges.

Lonny Remmers, 56, of Corona pleaded guilty to charges: inflicting bodily injury on a child as well as assault with a deadly weapon, according to the Los Angeles Times.

Pastor: Lonny Remmers allegedly used pliers on a 13-year-old boy's nipple

Darryl Jeter Jr., 30,  and Nicholas Craig, 24, two members of Remmers' Heart of Worship Community Church, reportedly took the victim to the desert in March 2012 and made him dig his own grave, according to affidavits obtained by the Times. Jeter and Craig allegedly ordered the boy to get into the grave, threw dirt on him, and beat him with belts, the victim's account in the affidavit said.

The boy was naked with visible wounds when Jeter and Craig brought him back to the group home, according to witness Steven Larkey's account in the affidavit. Larkey told police he heard screaming in the shower, and found out someone rubbed salt into the boy's wounds.

The victim was reportedly zip-tied naked, maced, then placed in the shower the next day, according to the affidavit. Larkey told police he saw blood inside the shower.

Remmers reportedly used pliers on the boy's nipple during a group Bible session on the same day, with 'approximately 12 other people in attendance,' according to the affidavit.

The victim told police he was placed at the home after living with his mother and sister because 'he was being disciplined for his behavior and not accepting responsibility for his actions,' according to the affidavit.

The Press-Enteprise reported that the boy sexually assaulted his younger sister.

Remmers has not been sentenced yet; the maximum sentence is two years, the Times said. Jeter and Craig 'were placed on three years of formal probation and must complete a year in custody.'
