Not satisfied: Mrs Young was awarded £26million - and branded the sum a disgrace

The fortune of a tycoon ordered to pay his ex-wife £26million in one of Britain's bitterest divorce battles is still missing, the High Court heard today.

Property developer Scot Young, 51, claimed he was penniless with huge debts during a six-year fight with his wife Michelle - but a judge last year declared he still had a multi-million pound fortune.

Despite the ruling 49-year-old Mrs Young has still not received a penny, even though almost £8million has been spent trying to trace his wealth.

Mrs Young was awarded a £20million settlement and £6million in legal costs in November after Mr Justice Moor declared her ex-husband was 'not a penniless man of straw with huge debts'.

Mrs Young - who had demanded £300million - called the vast sum a disgrace and insisted her ex-husband was still worth billions.

Today the judge accepted Mrs Young had still not received anything and said it appeared Mr Young had hidden his assets offshore.

'I do feel there is a real air of 
unreality in this case,' he told Mrs Young's counsel James Bogle.

'On my finding on the evidence Mr Young has 
hidden his assets offshore.

'Your client has spent £7 million and not been able to find 
anything. Nobody has been able to find any money at all.'

The claims came as Mrs Young made a failed bid to force her ex-husband's trustees Grant Thornton, who are dealing with his bankruptcy, to hold a public meeting and explain why they have been unable to recover any funds.

She also wanted to have the firm replaced by a new firm of trustees, claiming she had been 'ignored'.

Grant Thornton has spent £900,000 searching for Mr Young's assets over and above the £7million spent by his ex-wife, the court heard.

The judge today ruled Mrs Young's claim should be decided by the bankruptcy courts, where Mr Young's case will resume later this year.

Mrs Young, who lives in Westminster, central London, was ordered to pay the costs of today's failed application.

The judge added: 'It is 
not clear to me why anyone wants to be in charge of this case when 
no-one has recovered any money at all.'

At the settlement hearing in November Mr Justice Moor attacked the former couple for launching one of the most vicious divorce battles he had ever seen.

‘This case has been extraordinary even by the standards of the most bitter matrimonial breakdowns,' he said. 'Extremely serious allegations have been bandied around like confetti.

‘In many respects this is about as bad an example of how to litigate as I have encountered.’

‘I feel nothing but sympathy for the two children of these parties. Through no fault of their own, their parents’ marriage broke down.

‘A marital breakdown is distressing enough for any child, but for the divorce to then be played out in the full glare of the media must have been absolutely appalling for them.

‘What has occurred has not been 
child-focused. I truly hope that the parents will reflect on this. I 
hope it does not happen to any other children.’

The judge rejected Mrs Young's claim 
that her ex-husband spent £1million a year on dining out at expensive 
restaurants with bills up to £5,000 a time.

But he found the former 'Mr Fix-it' for Russian oligarchs and British billionaires had 'failed to give full and frank disclosure' about his assets and 'is hiding the truth.'

The couple married at Chelsea Register Office in March 1995. He described himself as a property developer and his wife was described as a company director.

The couple, whose daughters Scarlett and Sasha are aged 21 and 19, were living in Miami when they split up in 2006 after the relationship broke down.

Mrs Young was granted a divorce in February last year because of what the court ruled was his unreasonable behaviour.

However, she has said she will not agree to the divorce being made absolute - allowing her ex-husband to remarry - until the financial arrangements have been completed.

In January last year the same judge sent Mr. Young to prison for six months for 'flagrant and deliberate' contempt of court for failing to provide financial information to Michelle.

Mr Young has said that once divorced he plans to wed his 29-year-old fiancee, the model and actress Noelle Reno, with whom he lives in a luxury apartment in South Kensington, London.

He made no comment when he left court.
