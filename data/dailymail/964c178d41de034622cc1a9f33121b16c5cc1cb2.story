Newsnight presenter Jeremy Paxman has risked the anger of Scottish nationalists - by claiming the kilt was invented by the English.

The controversial BBC host, who is set to retire from the show, also said there was a 'head of steam in Scotland for hating the English' during an interview with Radio 4’s Saturday Live.

Mr Paxman went on to suggest that the Highland clearances, often associated with English repression of the Scots, was one of the 'great sustaining myths' of the country.

Newsnight presenter Jeremy Paxman has risked the wrath of Scottish nationalists - by claiming the kilt was invented by the English

Asked by Saturday Live presenter Aasmah Mir, how he liked the inclusiveness of ‘Britishness’, Mr Paxman said: 'Increasingly, since there is now such a head of steam in Scotland for 
hating the English, I describe myself as English, although I am in fact 
one quarter Scottish.

'It’s interesting, isn’t it, that in this union of supposed equals, only one side gets to vote on whether the union continues.'

A spokesman for the Yes Scotland independence campaign said Mr Paxman’s comments were as 'mad as ever', the Independent reports.

The veteran presenter later added that
 'hate' was an overstatement, but that is was more to do with a 
detestation of being 'ruled from London'.

Paxman,
 who has penned a book on national identity called The English, said 
that he would love to write a book abut the Scottish.

It has been claimed  since the 18th century that the short philabeg currently reognised as the traditional kilt was invented by a Thomas Rawlinson, a Lancashire Quaker

He said: 'We might start tackling some of the great sustaining Scottish myths, like the kilt, which was actually invented by an Englishman as far as I can tell. And the Highland clearances...'

The Highland clearances of the 18th and 19th centuries saw poor Highland farmers evicted from the land their family had called home for centuries, devastating Gaelic culture and clan society.

Some historians have claimed that clan leaders were as responsible for the clearances and resulting devastation as English - in their support for Bonnie Prince Charlie.

Paxman did not elaborate on what he meant in his reference to the clearances.

His comments about the kilt were also unexplained.

It has been claimed that the short  philabeg currently recognised as the traditional kilt was invented by a Thomas Rawlinson, a Lancashire Quaker

The origin of the kilt, as we know it 
today, has been traced back to an English Quaker from Lancashire, 
according to the last book written by the late Lord Dacre of Glanton.

The
 book, The Invention of Scotland: Myth and History, was written by Lord 
Dacre, formerly Hugh Trevor-Roper.

He claimed that the traditional dress of 
the Highlanders was a long Irish shirt and a cloak or plaid.

The stripes and colours of tartan were actually worn by the higher classes, he said.

He claimed that Thomas Rawlinson shortened the plaids of his workmen in the Highlands after they said they were uncomfortable.

This theory has also been contested by
 historians who claim that there is evidence of the short kilts being 
worn long before Rawlinson arrived in Scotland in the 1720s.

In a statement, the Yes Scotland campaign told the paper: 'We’d be very interested to read a book on the Scots by Mr Paxman. He would realise very quickly that he is mistaken in his assertion that there is a ‘head of steam for hating the English’.'
