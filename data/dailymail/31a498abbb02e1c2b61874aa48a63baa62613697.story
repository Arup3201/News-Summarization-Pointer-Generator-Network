A six-year-old Chicago boy foiled an attempted kidnapping, saving his 10-year-old neighbor from a man who tried to snatch her from the street outside her home.

Kaylen Woodard was playing last Thursday after school with his 10-year-old neighbor Marcy when a stranger stopped his car and tried to abduct the girl.

Kaylen says he kicked the man in the legs until Marcy struggled free and ran towards her home.

Brave little boy: Kaylen Woodard kicked a man who tried to abduct his 10-year-old neighbor

'He tried to hold her mouth,' Kaylen told ABC7 of the incident that happened around 5:30pm on the 6,900 block of South Calfornia Avenue in Chicago Lawn.

'The only way she got away is because I kicked him in the back of the leg and the outside of his leg,' he said.

Marcy's mom says her daughter way playing not 20 feet from her front door that day. Tracey Edwards went to the window to check on her when she saw her daughter running terrified towards the house.

'She was running with the scooter in her hand. She came in the house and she was panting. And she was explaining that a man had grabbed her,' says Edwards.

The horrified mother ran out of the home to try and catch a glimpse of the man, but he had already driven away.

She will be eternally grateful to the little boy who saved her daughter.

'I call him my little hero,' Edwards says. 'We were blessed that he was there.'

Kaylen's own mom is amazed at the heroic actions of her little boy.

'I'm very proud of him,' says Diana Blakely. 'I can't stop talking about it because I'm just in a state of shock, still. Him being so young, and he did that for a friend. That's amazing.'

Police are looking for a young white or Hispanic male aged 18-20 with short black hair and a light complexion who was driving a white convertible with red seats.
