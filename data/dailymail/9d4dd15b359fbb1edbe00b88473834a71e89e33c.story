Anderson Cooper was left battered, bruised and nearly blind after a day of filming himself riding waves in Portugal with world-record-setting surfer Garrett McNamara. 

The CNN anchor was experiencing the Portuguese swells from the back of a jet ski driven by McNamara, who holds the world record for surfing the tallest wave.

Cooper filmed the entire experience with a waterproof camera mounted to a stick, while several cameramen also filmed from jet skis nearby, as well as from land.

Battered: Anderson Cooper was left bruised and nearly blind after a day of filming himself riding waves in Portugal with world-record-setting surfer Garrett McNamara

Soaked: At one point during filming, Cooper took a fall a slipped off the jet ski into the ocean

Ouch: Cooper burned his eyeballs in the course of filming

'What we wanted to do with this story was to take the viewers as close as possible - as close as most people will ever get - to a big wave,' Cooper said. 

His producer, Keith Sharman, said the segment was extremely challenging to film. 

'By far, this was the most complicated shoot I had ever attempted in my career,' Sharman said.

In a clip released ahead of the show's March 6 air date, Cooper dares McNamara to drive the jet ski through two giant rocks protruding from the ocean that are about 25 yards apart.

'McNamara was reluctant,' Sharman said, adding that he, too, was concerned about their safety.

'I couldn't see [Cooper] from the cliff and that wasn't a good feeling,' he said. 'I think the first rule of producing is probably don't kill the correspondent.'

Close call: The water is extremely choppy as Cooper and McNamara zip between the two rocks

Terrifying: Cooper looks horrified as he watches a giant wave crash behind him

On the first try, Cooper fell off of his seat and into the choppy waters as the jet ski made a sharp turn.

After climbing back on board, McNamara caught a wave through the narrow passageway between the rocks and they zipped by without incident. 

As they came out the other side, McNamara and Cooper shouted and hooted with pleasure. 

But a later that night, Cooper had to cut filming short after he woke up and his eyes were burning. 

'I woke up in the middle of the night with excruciating pain in my eyes. I felt like I had sand or rocks in my eyes,' Cooper said. 'It turned out I had burned my eyeballs.'

McNamara may have also beaten his own record by surfing a 100-foot wave, though the feat hasn't been certified yet

Cooper said he laid in bed for a couple hours 'until finally I was like, "I better wake up Keith."'

Sharman recalled Cooper saying over the phone, '"Hey Keith, it's Anderson. I can't really see."' 

After a trip to the hospital, Cooper returned with a patch over one eye. The eye that wasn't covered was swollen and red. 

The shoot was cut short and Cooper went home. But the crew had still had enough footage to make the segment, which will air on Showtime on March 6.
