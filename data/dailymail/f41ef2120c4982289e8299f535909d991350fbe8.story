Three days after a handcuffed burglary suspect made off in a squad car, police have been left scratching their heads as to what happened to the opportunistic criminal.

Dash cam video from another police car 
caught 41-year-old Darren Porter getting out of the backseat of a car close to Fort Worth, Texas. He is still on the run after he managed to roll down a window, open the door and drive off.

Police had detained Porter on Friday 
morning after he allegedly broke into an antiques shop. He was 
handcuffed and placed into the back of a Ford Crown Victoria police car,
police said.

Smooth criminal: The suspect, Darren Porter, managed to unlock the back door of the squad car, police dash-cam footage shows

Squad cars are supposed to have the window switches in the back of the car disabled but not this one, Lt. J.P. Bevering said today.

Porter was able to roll down the window, reach out and open the door. Dash cam video shows him climbing into the driver's seat and taking off.

The car was found abandoned at a nearby apartment complex. Porter remained at large today.

Lt Bevering said: 'He's known to us because we've dealt with him several times.'

Kenny Boone, owner of Texas Gas Antiques & Collectibles, said he was meeting with police inside when he saw an officer running across his parking lot.

'Of course, they all jumped in their cars,' Mr Boone said. 'They were all scrambling to their vehicles to chase him.'

White Settlement police arrested Porter as recently as April on an assault charge. According to online court records, he pleaded guilty to a different charge and was sentenced to 90 days in jail.

Porter has a criminal history dating back more than two decades that includes arrests for several burglaries and thefts.

He did not have a working phone number listed.
