A new book Cyril Smith has revealed how the former Lib Dem leader David (now Lord) Steel recommended Smith for a knighthood

For far longer than should have been possible, the Liberal Democratic Party has passed itself off as the home of political virtue: more honest and less corrupt than what its leader Nick Clegg at the last election referred to dismissively as ‘the two old parties’.

That veil of purity has been stripped away by the exigencies of power.

For those on the Left who voted Lib Dem at the last election because of its pledge to scrap student fees, the party’s decision in government to support their tripling to £9,000 has destroyed its reputation for integrity.

Those on the Right who felt the party could be trusted to keep their word as partner with the Conservatives say ‘never again’, following Nick Clegg’s abrupt abrogation of the Coalition agreement to support a Bill for the creation of fewer and more equal-sized constituencies.

So much for the Lib Dems’ commitment to a ‘fairer electoral system’.

Those of no particular political leaning, who simply admired the Lib Dems’ critique of the way the ‘old parties’ handed out House of Lords seats to their financial backers, have seen how Clegg and Co have done exactly the same: the latest batch of Lib Dem nominated peerages for donors includes a faintly sinister nightclub owner.

Now one of the party’s previous nominations for honours has come back to haunt it.

In its serialisation of Smile For the Camera: The Double Life Of Cyril Smith, the Daily Mail has revealed how the former Lib Dem leader David (now Lord) Steel recommended Smith for a knighthood, despite knowing of the sordid stories about the way the former Rochdale Lib Dem MP had sexually abused a number of boys, some from a children’s home he had co-founded.

The book, co-written by Simon Danczuk, Smith’s successor as MP for Rochdale, gives horrifying accounts of how this 29st man, the single most recognisable figure in his party, sadistically forced himself on some of his most vulnerable constituents. 

It also contains compelling evidence of how Rochdale’s Mr Big — in every sense — was protected by senior figures in politics and the criminal justice system, to the disgust of local police officers who believed they had enough witness statements to bring a cast-iron case of serial sexual abuse.

As with Jimmy Savile, Smith’s perverted exploitation of a position of influence was something of an open secret.

Back in 1979, Private Eye published details of witness statements of Smith’s abuse on its main news page.

By no means are all stories in that periodical true in every particular — and it has the libel bills to show for that — but the striking thing about this one was that Smith neither publicly denied the accusations nor sued the magazine.

Danczuk’s conclusion is that the Liberal (later Lib Dem) leadership turned a blind eye to the whole story because Smith was too central a figure in the party and an irreplaceable element in its attempt to appeal to working-class voters especially in the North, where it had found it hard to make an electoral breakthrough.

On Saturday, a spokesman for the Lib Dem leader told the Mail: ¿Clearly he  would never have paid tribute to Cyril Smith if he¿d had any idea about these horrible allegations'

Indeed, Smith, a former mayor of Rochdale, was the prototype of what the party later made its modus operandi: a ferocious concentration on a select band of constituencies where every street would be intensively wooed with all manner of promises of a purely local nature. 

It was a British version of what in America is called pork barrel politics; and it has the same risks.

It is clear that one reason why Smith was so protected was that he had a pudgy finger in every local pie: he had done countless favours — and they could be called in.

Coincidentally, the man who masterminded this localised brand of electioneering for the Lib Dems, Lord Rennard, faces accusations of sexual harassment of party workers — though of an infinitely less serious nature.

Nick Clegg has already admitted the party had been far too slow to investigate the complaints against Rennard. But that is as nothing to the embarrassment he now faces: reminded of how, in 2008, he sent a message to be read out at Smith’s 80th birthday party, declaring: ‘You were a beacon for our party in the Seventies and Eighties and continue to be an inspiration to the people of Rochdale.’

On Saturday, a spokesman for the Lib Dem leader told the Mail: ‘Clearly he would never have paid tribute to Cyril Smith if he’d had any idea about these horrible allegations.’

How can that be true? As noted above, the allegations had been known since at least 1979. All that can be said is that Clegg (and, indeed, Lord Steel) found it convenient to disregard or forget them. 

Obviously, it is not the case that every unpleasant person is automatically guilty of anything levelled against them.

Yet even leaving aside the allegations of sexual abuse, Smith was a byword in the party for egomania, bullying and bluster, cordially loathed by the leadership.

He was, though, a formidable vote- winner: and for them, that is what counted. Like Smith himself, they just kept smiling.

Now, however, the party’s leadership has very little to smile about. The latest opinion polls have their public support at a derisory 7 per cent. They face annihilation in the imminent elections to the European Parliament. Given that almost the sole intact principle of the Lib Dems is their belief in ever greater harmonisation of Britain within the EU, this would represent a special humiliation.

It is too early to say they face similar extinction in the General Election, scheduled for June 2015. But if that were to happen, most of their leading figures could easily find accommodation in one or other of the ‘two old parties’. 

Of the Lib Dem Coalition ministers, Business Secretary Vince Cable used to be a Labour party member and would have no trouble being a colleague of Ed Miliband; Education minister David Laws would fit snugly into the Conservative party (as Michael Gove regularly tells him).

Besides which, the Lib Dems’ financial solvency is hardly guaranteed, especially if Cyril Smith’s victims are successful in suing the party for compensation. 

The truth is that if it were a business, this unhappy merger between the Liberal and Social Democratic parties would be wound up and its assets (such as they are) distributed among other interested parties.

If such an outcome could in any way be attributed to Cyril Smith’s misdeeds, then some good would have come out of his depravity. 

Anger: Lord Melchett opposes the use of pesticides on crops

Lord Melchett, a lobbyist for organic food growers, last week had a letter published in the Mail, insisting: ‘The claim that the Soil Association is telling consumers to buy organic food “to avoid getting cancer” is untrue.’

He was responding to this column, which noted Cancer Research UK’s announcement that in a large study of middle-aged women in the UK ‘we found no evidence that a woman’s overall cancer risk was decreased if she generally ate organic food’.

I repeat what I wrote then: that the Soil Association responded on its website that the public should treat this report from the pre-eminent British cancer research charity ‘with a pinch of organic salt’.

What else is this but an attempt to continue to persuade families that they should be scared of getting cancer from eating food grown with pesticides? Indeed, on its website, under the headline ‘Effects on Health’ the Soil Association states: ‘The most dangerous chemicals used in farming, such as organophosphates, have been linked with a range of problems, including cancer.’

Again, this is a clear attempt to scare the public about the (non-existent) enhanced risk of cancer from food grown with chemicals.

Lord Melchett’s grandfather and great-grandfather must be turning in their graves: both were chairmen of Imperial Chemical Industries.

Venera Minakhmetova, 24, was killed five months ago on a roundabout in East London, when her bike was struck by a lorry. Last week a coroner found that ‘the fundamental cause of this collision was Venera going through a red light.’

Ghastly for her family to be told that it was her own fault: but perhaps the coroner’s verdict will cause more cyclists to realise that traffic lights are for their own protection, as well as that of pedestrians.

As one of the latter group, I have three times in recent months been forced to take evasive action so as not to be struck by a cyclist hurtling through a red light.

The most annoying aspect is that they tend to shout out as if you were the one committing an offence.
