Pensioners will today be offered new freedoms to dip into their retirement cash.

In the latest phase of the biggest shake-up of private pensions in a century, the over-55s will be able to withdraw several lump sums from their pension pots instead of just one.

George Osborne’s move raises the prospect of pensioners using their funds almost like bank accounts to invest in property or shares, pay off debts or help children and grandchildren.

Shake-up: The latest phase in changes to pensions will be announced today by Chancellor George Osborne

The Chancellor has already announced that they will no longer have to buy poor- value annuities.

And a crippling 55 per cent tax charge on pensions left to children and grandchildren is being abolished altogether.

Up until now, retirees were able to take 25 per cent of their pension tax free – a sum fixed on the day they first dipped into their pots.

If you had a £100,000 pot at the age of 55, the maximum you could take tax-free was £25,000. The rest typically went into an annuity.

However, in the Pensions Bill the Chancellor will announce you can dip into your fund multiple times and have 25 per cent of each slice tax free. The balance would remain invested and grow, again tax free – giving savers an incentive to keep their money invested in the stock market.

Money headaches: Previously couples had to decide what they would do with their pensions the first time they dipped into the pot, creating a system which was less flexible than the one being introduced (posed by models)

Under today’s proposals, if the 55-year-old with a pension pot of £100,000 was to withdraw £5,000 they would receive £1,250 – or 25 per cent – tax free and the remaining £3,750 would be taxed at their current income tax rate.

The £95,000 remaining in their pension fund – and any growth – could later be withdrawn in as many instalments as they wanted – 25 per cent of it tax free.

Mr Osborne said: ‘People who have worked hard and saved all their lives should be free to choose what they do with their money, and that freedom is central to our long-term economic plan.

‘From next year they’ll be able to access as much or as little of their defined contribution pension as they want and pass on their hard-earned pensions to their families tax-free.’

Criticism: Labour MPs said the move could encourage people to overspend early in retirement

Ros Altmann, a pensions expert and a Government adviser on older people, said: ‘The Government’s changes have the potential to help millions of pension savers make better use of their pension funds. Being free to access their money freely as they need to, rather than being forced to buy particular products, will be very popular.

‘It’s something you couldn’t do ever before because of the inflexibility of the system.

‘As soon as you wanted to take any money at all out of your pension fund, you had to secure an income with the remainder. So you had to buy an annuity or a drawdown product.

‘Now you will have the freedom to do what you want. However, people need to know that their pension provider will allow them to take advantage of the new freedoms.

‘Currently, most pension companies are not ensuring that their customers can take money out flexibly. I call on the industry to make sure people can really benefit from the new changes as quickly as possible.’

Some economists and Labour MPs warn that allowing people to withdraw cash from their pension pots rather than forcing most to buy an annuity, providing an income for life, was risky. Most people at 60 or 65 underestimate their life expectancy and could overspend early in retirement, they argue.

But Mr Osborne insisted that the 13million people in defined contribution pension schemes are ‘responsible people’ who had saved throughout their lives and were quite capable of making decisions for themselves, with professional advice.

He used his party conference speech last month to announce another reform – an end to ‘penal’ taxes on pension cash left by people to their children and grandchildren.

At present, if people die without exhausting their pension funds, their inheritance to any children or grandchildren over the age of 23 is taxed at a ruinous 55 per cent. But from April next year, the tax will be abolished altogether, bringing it into line with money left to spouses.

In another boost for pensioners, the Government’s ‘triple lock’ to guarantee rises in the state pension above inflation and wages is expected to take effect today.

Today’s inflation figures are the ones traditionally used to fix the pension increase for next year. But with experts saying the inflation rate is likely to be well below 2.5 per cent, the triple lock will kick in to ensure a rise at that level – meaning another significant real-terms increase in pensioners’ pockets.
