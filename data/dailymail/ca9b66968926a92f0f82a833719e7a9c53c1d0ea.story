Movie bosses have sparked fury with the placement of an 'incredibly insensitive' advert for a new film about the September 11 attacks just yards from the site where almost 3,000 people lost their lives.

The video ad for Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close shows the disintegrating Twin Towers ablaze on a subway hoarding beside Ground Zero.

Firefighters and families who lost colleagues and loved ones in the 2001 terror attack have branded the marketing drive offensive and have complained that the ads are too close to home.

They say the siting of the promotional material for the Warner Bros feature is unforgiveable and they are upset that there is no warning that the emotional footage is about to be shown on the video-style adverts.

Passerbys can see the horror replayed over and over again from the sidewalk without any notice.

One firefighter from Ladder 9 in New York's East Village, told the New York Post: 'We lost ten guys that day. I won’t go see it. I saw the ad last night. I just can’t. People who live and work around here would be offended by those ads. That happened right here.'

Lest we forget: The 9/11 Memorial at Ground Zero, on the site of the former World Trade Centre twin towers. Families of victims are furious at the placement of video adverts using footage of the fall of the towers to sell the latest September 11 movie.

The video adverts featuring the flaming Twin Towers can be seen along Church Street at Murray, Vesey and Courtland Streets. It also appears in front of the Millennium Hilton Hotel.

Every single one of the locations is in the shadow of the new World Trade Centre construction.

The ads have been run in 40 digital panels throughout Manhattan with 500 posters on the city subways and buses.

Forty massive billboards have promoted the latest Tom Hanks blockbuster in the heart of the district most affected by the devastating assault.

Movie makers stand accused of making money out of the atrocity which killed 2,606 people in the Twin Towers alone, a tally that includes 343 New York firefighters.

Families of victims say they were not given warning that the sickening footage would be shown on a loop in public.

They claim that such is the force of the horror of the attack New Yorkers still suffer from stress as a result of the events of the September 11 attack ten years ago.

A spokesman for Warner Bros said today that the company would cancel the ads and apologised for any distress they may have caused.

The film, based on the 2005 novel by Jonathan Safran Foer, stars Tom Hanks as a 9/11 victim.

The story follows his sensitive nine-year-old son, Oskar Schell, on his journey to find the lock that fits a mysterious key left behind by his father.

Hollywood A-lister Sandra Bullock and child star Thomas Horn also star in the latest movie about the disaster.

The downing of the Twin Towers was part of four co-ordinated Al-Qaeda suicide attacks which resulted in the deaths of 2,996 immediate victims, including the 19 hijackers.

The Islamist extremists hijacked four
airliners and intentionally crashed two of them into the World Trade 
Centre. The towers collapsed within two hours of being struck.

They also took control of American Airlines Flight 77 forcing it down over the Pentagon in Arlington, Virginia.

The
fourth jet, United Airlines Flight 93, crashed into a field near 
Shanksville, Pennsylvania, as passengers forced it down before it could 
reach the attackers' intended target in Washington DC.

Apart
from 55 military casualties all the victims were civilian. The names of
some of the immediate victims of 9/11 were not added to official 
figures until years later.

Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close
is the boldest cinematic tackling of September 11 yet. Instead of 
dealing with the hard facts of the fateful day that shook America, as 
its predecessors have, it is the first work of fiction to take up the 
tragedy, diving straight into grief and loss.

But many have accused the movie of 
being too much too soon. At the recent tenth anniversary of the terror attacks 
and the official opening of the memorial site, it was clear to 
see that emotions still run high, tears are still being shed and 
memories are still raw.

Director Stephen Daldry said: 'Some people might find the wound too big and that they can't go there — and they shouldn't go there. Some people will find it cathartic. I had to follow my own instincts on it.'

Four other films have been made about the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Centre.
