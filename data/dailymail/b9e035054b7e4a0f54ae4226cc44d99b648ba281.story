Showcasing a bare midriff may be one of this year's hottest trends, but apparently crop tops come with an age limit.

Women should ditch belly-baring tops by the age of 34 and avoid showing off midriffs in bikinis as soon as they reach 40, a new study has suggested.

Researchers found two thirds of women believe certain clothes should come with a 'wear by' ageÂ  - regardless of the condition of your body - with most trend-led items deemed unsuitable by the big 4-0.

Ditch the crop: A new survey found that women should ditch belly-bearing crop-tops by the age of 34 (like Pink) and avoid showing off midriffs in bikinis as soon as they reach 40, like Heidi Klum

Miniskirts, hot pants and belly button piercings should also be avoided after your mid-thirties.

The belly bashing didn't stop there as women are also being told to avoid baring their tummy or showing too much skin if they have stretch marks and scars, if they're pregnant, married or have children.

The study of 2,000 women found that it's not just crop tops and bikinis that the over 30s need to avoid with the miniskirt being labelled as 'too old' for those aged 37 or above, while hot pants should be ditched at 35.

Leggings should also hit the bin by 37 and stilettos are a no-no if you are in the 41plus age group.

Belly button piercings should be removed by the time you turn 35 while long hair should be given the chop at 42 to a shorter more 'mature' look.

And 27 per cent believed ladies should stop shopping in 'younger' clothes stores like Topshop and Miss Selfridge once they reach their early forties.

Over a fifth of those polled said they would put age aside and show off their body if they had a flatter or less bloated looking tummy like celebs but admitted they found it incredibly hard to achieve.

Another 16 per cent believe in the mantra 'if you've got it, flaunt it'.

It also emerged that it's not just women who should put limits on their wardrobe, as the results also showed that men should give their beloved football shirts the boot at the age of 25.

Researchers also found that women are taking the lead from celebrities with 67 per cent of those surveyed saying famous females are making it more acceptable for women to wear belly-bearing clothes after a certain age.

Top tum: 43-year-old Gwen Stefani beat off stiff twenty-something competition to be crowned best celebrity tummy, followed by Cheryl Cole

And Gwen Stefani came out as the biggest 'flat tum' inspiration after being crowned the most inspirational celebrity midriff.

The 43-year-old No Doubt singer beat off stiff twenty-something competition from the likes of Corrie heartthrob Michelle Keegan and Rihanna to prove she is no top of the flops in the tummy department.

Jennifer Aniston, Halle Berry and Kate Hudson, who are also in their forties, were listed amongst the top 10.

A spokesman for 
All-Bran, who carried out the research, said: 'People may say "if you've got it, 
flaunt it", but it seems that this isn't always the case for some of our
wardrobe staples.

'It's 
alarming that the crop top or bikini is causing such widespread 'midriff
mayhem' and women actually believe it should come with some kind of a 
wear by date.

'Ultimately, it 
should come down to how confident you feel about your stomach and body -
if you have worked hard to maintain a flat tum, you should be able to 
show it off.

'But for some 
women, a flat, less bloated tummy can prove elusive no matter how many 
stomach crunches they do and mean they aren't comfortable in revealing 
clothes as they get older.

'However,
the secret can be as simple as making a few small dietary changes like 
eating a fibre rich breakfast cereal every day, which is proven to ease 
bloating and that swollen tum look.

'Thankfully it seems like the celebs have got it sussed when it comes to understanding the relationship between feeling good on the inside and looking great and are not afraid to show off their midriffs- whatever their age.'

Contenders: Rihanna and Kelly Brook were also voted as having some of the best tummies in the business

Carol Vorderman isn't likely to agree with this new research after she said yesterday that it is 'heartbreaking' that woman 
turn away from trendy clothes just because they think that they should.

The results of a style survey by 
isme.com, for which Carol is the style ambassador, revealed that eight out of 10 Britons think that women should start
dressing down after they hit the age of 50.

But former Countdown co-host Carol Vorderman, 53, is now urging women over 50 to wear they want.
