The ‘billionaire building’ just south of Central Park in Manhattan asks potential residents to pay a pretty penny to live there, so it seems only natural that developers want to offer the best of everything to excite and entice.

For the price, high-rolling buyers paying millions of dollars for their places of residence at One57 expect nothing but the best, but they shouldn’t be disappointed.

A video tour of the sales building in Midtown shows what millions of dollars can by, with top-of-the-line appliances, materials, and even offer a television in the bathroom.

Forbes Magazine sent Morgan Brennan to get a look of the inside spaces in a build-out model at their Midtown sales office, and was guided around the model apartments by Director of Sales Dan Tubb.

The gourmet kitchen features outward ventilation and two dishwashers for units of three bedrooms and above.

The kitchen, which comes in two possible finishes, also includes two 36-inch refrigerators, granite counter tops, extensive storage, and a full-sized wine cooler.

Some cabinets are not what they seem and pull out from the kitchen island to become stools.

The under-construction residential high-rise, located at 157 W. 57th Street in Midtown Manhattan, and is much buzzed-about in the New York real estate community, as much because of its staggering price as its sweeping views.

One penthouse suite was sold for a record fee in excess of $90million - and the new owner hasn't even seen it yet.

The astronomical fee eclipses the $88million forked out by Russian billionaire Dmitry Rybolovlev on a penthouse for his daughter last winter at 15 Central Park West.

It proves that while the economic situation may be precarious some still have deep enough pockets to splash out super properties.

A 'recognisable' buyer has snapped up a penthouse on the 89th and 90th floor of the under-construction One57 tower block in Manhattan.

1. Penthouse in One57 on 157 West 57th street: Between $90million and $100million.

2. The Woolworth Mansion on East 80th Street: $90 million.

7. Pre-war home 720 Park Avenue: $27.5million

8. Fifth Avenue duplex: $26.5million

9. 640 Park Avenue: $26million

10. East 78th Street: $26million

Figures from Realtor.com published March 2012

In exchange for the astronomical price the mystery buyer will get a 10,923-square-foot space opposite Carnegie Hall with incredible views over the city.

While Extell Development Company has not revealed exactly how much the plush living space has fetched they have said the figure is between $90 - $100million.

The high sum is thought to be due to uncertainty abroad, which has led foreign investors taking a greater interest in New York real estate.

Situated on 157 West 57th street the tower will become the tallest residential building in the city when it is finished next year.

The New York Post has reported that some potential buyers have claimed there are 'design flaws' with the construction - namely that builders failed to provide a sufficient number of elevators.

But new owner of the high-rise apartment who according to Extell chairman Gary Barnett is from a 'nice family' clearly didn't share the same concerns.

The new 1,000ft building will offer stunning vistas but the enormous structure will block the view from other nearby luxury buildings, which are expected to see their prices fall.

Foreign buyers, including Brazilians, Chinese and Russians, have been on keeping New York and Miami real estate sellers busy in recent months, developers and brokers say.

Russian and Ukrainian buyers have shown a particular willingness to pay large sums for 'trophy' properties. However, Mr Barnett insisted the person who had purchased the penthouse apartment was not from Russia or the Ukraine.

The $100million mark for an apartment in New York has yet to be surpassed but earlier this year Mr Barnett said a foreign investor was 'very seriously looking' at the Winter Garden unit - a duplex featuring a solarium totaling 13,500ft.

The buyer was looking at buying  that apartment and another floor to create a 20,000 square feet space for a price of between $100 and $150 million, Mr. Barnett said.

No doubt the owners will be able to afford good window treatments if they want to block out the incredible lights visible from the master bedroom in order to sleep
