'Treated like a criminal': The mother of a 15-year-old boy (not pictured) has demanded an apology from prosecutors after he was put on trial for throwing a snowball at a teenage girl

A mother has demanded an apology from the Crown Prosecution Service after her 15-year-old son was put on trial for throwing a snowball in the face of a teenage girl.

The teenager was charged with assault by beating and has been dragged to court five times since the February incident.

His ordeal until only ended on Thursday when magistrates ruled there was no case to answer and threw the case out.

Yesterday, the boy's mother said she was furious at prosecutors for ever bringing the case and denied her son had even thrown the snowball.

The woman, who cannot be identified to protect the anonymity of her son, said: 'The past six months have been a nightmare for my son, with this ridiculous prosecution hanging over him.

'We were so relieved when the magistrates said there was no case to answer but we are angry it ever came to this.

'God only knows how much this prosecution has cost the taxpayer. We've been told it's many thousands of pounds. What a waste of money.

'My son has been treated like a criminal and for what? A snowball that may or may not have been thrown, may or may not have hit a person and in any case was not thrown by him.'

The maximum sentence for an adult convicted of assault by beating is six months in custody, and the Ministry of Justice said the penalty remains the same for youth offenders - although magistrates would be more likely to take account of a defendant's young age and mitigation when sentencing at a youth court.

The teenager was arrested at his home the morning after a teenage girl complained he had thrown a snowball at her at a local recreation area.

The boy's mother, who lives with her family in a village near Leicester, added: 'He's only a young boy and was frightened. He was kept in a cell all day and all night.'

She said her 'jaw dropped' when he was charged with assault by beating and appeared in court the following day.

What cost to the taxpayer? The boy's six-month ordeal finally came to an end this week when magistrates at Leicester Youth Court (above) threw the case out. A spokesman for the CPS (headquarters above) said the prosecution was justified

The court imposed bail conditions which included a 7pm to 7am curfew.

The family attended court sessions on five occasions, including a trial at Loughborough, in March, when the case was adjourned.

At Thursday's Leicester Youth Court hearing, the teenage complainant and two other witnesses gave evidence.

But none could be sure the boy, who had been having a snowball fight with a friend, had targeted the complainant. After listening to the prosecution case, magistrates ruled there was no case to answer.

His mother added: 'The whole thing has been totally stupid.The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) should have never sanctioned this prosecution.'

She said she wanted an apology from the CPS.

Speaking after the case, the boy said: 'I just want to put all this behind me now and get on with things. The past six months have been horrible.'

A CPS spokesman said there had been 'clear evidence the complainant had been deliberately targeted and that this was more than just a youthful snowball fight.'

He added: 'The evidence, including two witness statements, pointed to the fact the defendant had made and thrown the snowball and made comments of a hostile nature afterwards.

'This, coupled with the fact that the complainant was recovering from a serious eye injury, meant a court should be asked to judge the case.

'If, however, during a hearing, evidence by witnesses appears to fluctuate from the statements provided, a court can determine there is no case to answer .'

Guidance issued by the Sentencing Council says custodial sentences for juveniles should only be imposed in the most serious cases.

A spokesman for Leicestershire Police said: 'The incident was fully investigated and the evidence put before the CPS to decide if charges should be brought.'

In March last year, Dean Smith, 31, of Swadlincote, Derbyshire, was handed a two-week curfew after he admitted assaulting a woman Police Community Support Officer by throwing a snowball.
