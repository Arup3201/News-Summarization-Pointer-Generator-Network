The sleepy Welsh village of Llangynwyd was stunned on Saturday when the woman vying to be the next U.S. First Lady dropped in for a traditional pub lunch.

Taking time off from helping husband Mitt get to the White House, Ann Romney called in to 850-year-old pub, the Old House, searching for long-lost relatives and promoting her rags-to-riches story as the granddaughter of a Welsh coalminer.

Mrs Romney's grandfather, David Davies, is from the nearby village of Nantyffyllon in Wales and emigrated to America in the 1920s after being crushed in a mining accident.

'It is very good to be here and see the village that my grandfather would have known so well,' said Ms Romney, who spent the afternoon chatting with villagers and visiting graves at the local churchyard.

'Everyone has been very nice to me. I enjoyed seeing the pub and the church so much.'

With her rags-to-riches story as a coalminer's granddaughter, Ann 
Romney has been cast in the campaign as the epitome of the American 
dream and an inspiration to the U.S. electorate.

Both Ann and Mitt regularly refer to Davies' struggles in an effort to connect with voters and dispel claims that the Republican candidate for president is out of touch with ordinary Americans.

Mrs Romney has also treated 
campaigners and journalists to Welsh cakes while on the campaign trail, 
apparently from her grandmother's recipe.

The mother-of-five's trip to explore her British roots was filmed by an NBC camera crew and will be broadcast by TV station soon.

Davies worked at Welsh coalmine, Coegnant Colliery, before moving to Detroit to work in the car industry in 1929. He was later joined by his wife, Annie, and his three sons including, Edward, 15, who was Mrs Romney's father.

In his new home, Edward Davies went to college, founded a business and working on the Nasa space programme.

The would-be First Lady was dished up
traditional Welsh fare at the centuries-old pub, which had just a week 
to prepare for the visit after being given security clearance by US 
officials.

She
ate Welsh rarebit, which is essentially grilled cheese, rack of lamb, 
wild mushroom and pea risotto and a selection of Welsh cheeses.

Mrs
Romney chatted with locals including the village’s oldest resident 
Jenny Williams, 79, as she searched for information about her Welsh 
heritage.

'She has been 
great and was glad to chat with everyone,' said Richard Stephens-David, 
landlord of The Old House, whose former patrons include Richard Burton, 
Elizabeth Taylor and David Bowie.

On the campaign trail: Ann Romney's 'working class' story is seen as the epitome of the American Dream and could help her husband overcome his negative 'elitist' media image

American Dream: Mitt Romney with his family and wife Ann. Her ancestry lies in South Wales and her story is becoming an increasing part of Romney's campaign for a presidential nomination

'It was a very successful day for us 
and the whole valley really. To have someone who could be the most 
important woman in the world in eight months time is fantastic.'

Mrs
Romney was also shown around St Cynwyd’s Church in the village and laid
flowers on the graves of her relatives before being treated to a 
performance from a local male voice choir.

'I
gave her a tour of the church we went out afterwards to three family 
graves because she was a Davies before she married,' Vicar at St 
Cynwyd’s the Rev Geraldine Blyth said.

'I
managed to find burial records of her three relatives so when she came 
into the church she looked at those and I have also found copies of 
those entries. She was quite touched to see the graves.'

Ms Blyth added that having a famous face in town had been exciting.

'It’s good to have visitors whoever 
they are but sometimes it’s nice to have someone high profile and 
someone who appreciates what it is that we have,' she said.

Residents were a little shocked at Mrs Romney’s visit - and by the NBC camera crew that descended on the village.

'I think it’s good she has come here,' said retired Llangynwyd man David Griffith-Williams, 73.

'It’s
a good thing for the area and a good thing for America - they could do 
with a bit of cultural inspiration. It’s an important link really.'

Digging for history: Mrs Romney is extremely proud of her Welsh roots, which she has passed on to her five sons who she sent down a mine on a visit to Wales so they could share their grandfather's experience

Neighbour Stuart Evans, 66, said the visit had put the village on the map.'It’s great she visited her distant relatives. It’s put the village on the map but it gives it an extra bit of profile.'

While in Wales, Mrs Romney also caught up with relatives including her second cousin, former Wales and British Lions rugby player Roddy Evans.

'We remain very attached to all the family who went to America at the time,' he said. 'I’m very grateful to have them as cousins. They are very lovely people. It’s a privilege to know them and have an association with them.'

Mrs Romney has been in the United Kingdom for the London Olympics, which proved a disastrous first official visit for her husband Mitt who was ridiculed by the British press for suggesting the capital was not ready to stage the sporting event.

But while his wife is away, Mitt, who returned to the U.S. last week, has had to fend for himself, popping into Hunter's Shop and Save supermarket in Wolfeboro, North Hampshire, to do the grocery shopping today.
