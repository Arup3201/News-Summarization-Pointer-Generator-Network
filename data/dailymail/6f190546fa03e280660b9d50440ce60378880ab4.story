A  lucky Labrador was saved from a frozen Michigan lake after falling through the ice just meters away from a Coast Guard crew having their morning meeting.

The team briefing at Frankfort Coast Guard station was interrupted on Tuesday when one of the crew spotted the dog plunge through the ice into the freezing waters of Betsie Lake in Michigan.

Donning their cold water suits, the Coast Guard rushed to the lake where Tim Putnam, boatswain mate third class, swam 200 feet through loose ice into the channel where Betsie Lake met Lake Michigan to save the animal.

The Coast Guard crew were at a briefing in Frankfort Coast Guard station on Tuesday when one of the team spotted the dog plunge through the ice

'I had to push a lot of the ice out of the way, it was pretty exhausting,' Putnam told NBC News. As he got closer, he said he could see it shivering but the dog began to try and swim towards its rescuers.

'It was almost like he knew it was his last chance. Luckily we got him out in time, it didn't look like he had too much left in him.'

Putnam was able to reach the Lab and with the help of his crew, managed to haul her out of the water and bring her into the warm in under half an hour.

Putnam said pushing the loose ice out of the way had been 'exhausting' but as he got closer, the dog began to swim towards him 

'Our crews stand ready to answer the call for help, even if it means crawling through 200 feet of slurpee-like ice,' the Coast Guard wrote in a Facebook post.

'Station Frankfort's ice rescue team saved this dog from the water because a life is a life and they wanted to make sure that they were the ones taking the risk of going in instead of an unprepared bystander.'

The dog, nicknamed Betsie by her rescuers, was sent to recover at the Animal Welfare League of Benzie County, in Beulah, Michigan where she was found to be in good health despite the frozen ordeal.

With no identification or microchip, her rescuer Putnam had offered to adopt Betsie if her owners could not be traced.

However, her owner was eventually located they have been happily reunited. 

In a similar case on Tuesday afternoon in Arlington, Massachusetts, firefighters saved a dog from the icy waters of the Mystic River which had fallen into the river while chasing swans. Lucy the dog was also saved.
