Despite its reputation, stress can cause us to lead a healthier lifestyle, according to a new research.

Five experiments showed that while stress can cause some people to overeat or indulge in a spending spree, it can cause just as many people to do more exercise or eat healthily, too.

Scientists found that people tend to rely on the habits they have already formed rather than automatically turning to destructive behaviour when put under pressure.

The findings suggest that we do not have
 finite resources for self-discipline and that in fact we can control 
ourselves just as much when stressed as when relaxed.

Scientists found that people rely on the habits they have already formed rather than automatically turning to destructive behaviour when put under pressure. Gym goers turn to exercise to get them through tough times

'When we try to change our behaviour, we 
strategise about our motivation and self-control,' said Wendy Wood, Provost Professor of Psychology and Business at University of Southern California.

'But what we should be 
thinking about instead is how to set up new habits. Habits persist even 
when we're tired and don't have the energy to exert self-control.'

Wood is a leading expert on 
habit, the automatic behaviours that make it possible for us to function each day.

Learned habits also play a big role in 
our health -  research has shown that exercise, overeating and smoking are
 significant risk factors for major diseases.

But while most disease prevention 
efforts focus on self-control, the latest research from Wood shows that 
the best way to prevent disease might be knowing how to let go: 'Everybody gets stressed.

'The focus on controlling your behaviour 
may not actually be the best way to get people to meet goals. If you are somebody who doesn't have a lot of willpower, our study 
showed that habits are even more important.'

In one experiment Professor Wood and colleagues followed students for a term, including during 
exams.

Stress is traditionally associated with increased smoking and drinking but just as many people engage in healthy behaviour to get through stress. Research has shown that learned habits play a large role in our present and future health

They found that during exams, when students were 
stressed and sleep-deprived, they were even more likely to stick to old 
habits. It was as if they didn't have the energy to do something new, Professor
Wood explained.

Students who ate unhealthy breakfasts 
during the term â€“ such as pastries or doughnuts â€“ ate even more of 
the junk food during exams.

But the same was true of healthy eaters: 
those in the habit of eating a healthy breakfast were also more likely 
to stick to their routine and ate especially well in the morning when under 
pressure.#

Similarly, students who had a habit of 
reading the newspaper everyday during the term were more likely to perform this habit during exams â€“ even when
 they were limited in time.

And regular gym-goers were even more likely 
to go to the gym when stressed.

'You might expect that, when students 
were stressed and had little time, they wouldn't read the paper at all, 
but instead they fell back on their reading habits,' said Wood.

'Habits 
don't require much willpower and thought and deliberation.'

Wood concluded: 'So, the central 
question for behaviour change efforts should be, how can you form 
healthy, productive habits?

'What we know about habit formation is that 
you want to make the behaviour easy to perform, so that people repeat it 
often and it becomes part of their daily routine.'

All five experiments appeared in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology.
