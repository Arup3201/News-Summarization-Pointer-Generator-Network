Turner Prize-winning artist Grayson Perry has shown off his latest project - a chapel-style building which is set to become a holiday home.

Scaffolding has just come down from the property, which has been funded by a company formed by philosopher Alain de Botton and sits overlooking the Stour estuary near Wrabness in Essex.

Perry has created what he has described as a 'secular chapel' with his first step into the world of architecture, with tiled exterior walls and a brass finish to the roof.

His progress on the project has been filmed for a Channel 4 programme Grayson's Greatest Design, working with de Botton's company Living Architecture which aims to create holiday homes in properties with striking and innovative designs.

Perry has created a folly-style building, dedicated to the memory of a mythical Essex 'everywoman' called Julie with statues and images set into the tiles.

The project received planning permission despite some objections and Perry has in the past admitted that calmed down his original design which he said stemmed from 'doodling wildly and quite drunkenly in front of the TV'.

The site of the building, which Perry describes as a secular chapel, is still under construction but will be completed at the end of the year

He sought inspiration from single mothers in Dagenham and hairdressers in Colchester as well as taking into account the landscape and history of Essex.

Perry collaborated with the architectural practice FAT, working with local builders and craftspeople.

It will remain under construction until much later in the year.
