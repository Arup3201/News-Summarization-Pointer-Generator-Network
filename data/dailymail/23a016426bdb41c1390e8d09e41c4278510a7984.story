Kate Moss brought a dose of rock ‘n roll glamour to a rural retreat better known as ‘the Cotswolds of Scotland’.

The supermodel and her celebrity friends took the £150-a-night Craigellachie Hotel at the weekend - a rural Speyside getaway - as they celebrated nutritionist Rose Ferguson’s 40th birthday with a Burns-themed bash.

They were joined by the likes of Noel Gallagher, Nick Grimshaw and Sadie Frost for a wild weekend of partying on the banks of the River Spey – an area once known as a favourite destination of Queen Victoria.

Kate Moss brought a dose of rock ‘n roll glamour to the Craigellachie Hotel - a rural retreat in Speyside dubbed ‘the Cotswolds of Scotland’

The 120-year-old country hotel has recently been re-opened after a £3m refurbishment.

It features a renowned whiskey bar called The Quaich, which has one of Scotland’s biggest selections of single malt whiskys, and which stocks almost 1,000 bottles.

The group also partied at the hotel’s newly-installed Copper Dog pub – where they tucked into a supper of haggis, neeps and tatties.

The party was a traditionally Scottish affair, with a piper playing happy birthday on the bagpipes.

The area is perhaps an unlikely destination for the supermodel.

It is better known as an ‘angler’s paradise’, and the River Spey is famous for salmon, sea trout and brown trout fishing.

However, perhaps more fitting for the hard-partying star Speyside does feature the largest concentration of Scotch whisky distilleries in the country including Glenfiddich and Macallan.

The area was said to be much recommended by Victorian doctors, for its efficacious air, while Queen Victoria was known to be a regular visitor.

Originally built in 1893 as a destination for the Victorians who wanted to take in the clean air and enjoy the local countryside, The Craigellachie was bought last year by Piers Adam – the entrepreneur behind nightclubs including Mahiki and Cabaret.

He decided to rejuvenate the hotel to its former glory following a visit to the Highlands three years ago.

The Copper Dog pub has been installed in the basement of the hotel and provided the venue for a hard night of partying for Kate Moss and her celebrity friends

The hotel's 28 bedrooms has been restored, maintaining original features such a fireplaces and antique furniture, the en-suites have also been refurbished in keeping with the traditional feel of the hotel

He came across the hotel by chance after travelling to the area with his father who had been evacuated to the area during WW2.

He said: ‘When I first stayed at The Craigellachie I instantly fell in love with the place. However I was saddened that it had become run down and lost some of its spark.

‘For the next year or so I kept my eye on the sale of the hotel hoping that someone would buy and restore it, and then I made the snap decision to buy it myself.

Many of the fabrics used in the soft furnishings have been sourced from local mills and the shortbread and water are from local businesses

The hotel also features a billiards room and a basement cinema room which can be used for private screenings

‘Most of my businesses are related to bars and restaurants in London and internationally so I really hadn’t considered a hotel in the Highlands of Scotland.

‘However, there is something special about The Craigellachie and Speyside. There is a real sense of community in the area and I really want The Craigellachie to continue to be part of that.’

Throughout the hotel each of the 28 bedrooms has been restored, maintaining original features such a fireplaces and antique furniture, the en-suites have also been refurbished in keeping with the traditional feel of the hotel.
