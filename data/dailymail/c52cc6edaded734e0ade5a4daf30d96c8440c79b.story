A 94-year-old Chinese woman sued her children because they were not taking care of her.

A court ordered that three of Zhang Zefang's children take her into their homes for four months of the year each.

Another was told to pay her $10 a month, and all four of her adult children must split the costs of her medical bills.

It comes after a law change in China, 
which came into effect in July, stating that parents should be supported emotionally as well as financially by their children.

This means people can be taken to court for not visiting their parents.

Ms Zefang claimed she never wanted to sue her sons, Zhou Mingde, 71, Zhou Yinxi, 68, and Zhou Gangming, 56, and daughter, 54-year-old Zhou Yunhua. But she said she did not have a choice.

She is now temporarily living with her youngest son and her daughter-in-law, Kuang Shiying.

‘I never thought about whether my kids would take care of
me when I was old,’ she said.

‘I just focused on taking care of them.’

Zhang Zefang, of Fusheng in the Changshou district, is one of more than 1,000 parents to have sued their offspring in China in the last 15 years.

When she went to her village court, she was told she should sue her children so the law could force them to take care of her.

A court official said that local people mostly consider the children neglectful and are shocked that the matter has been aired in court.

Middle son Yinxi has yet to pay anything to his mother, despite being told to give her $10 a month.
