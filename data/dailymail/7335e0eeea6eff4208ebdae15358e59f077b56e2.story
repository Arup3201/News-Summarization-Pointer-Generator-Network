United States and Everton goalkeeper Tim Howard has been voted the US Soccer Male Athlete of the Year for 2014.

The 35-year-old shot-stopper, who has been at Goodison Park since 2007, has made 104 international appearances, this year eclipsing Kasey Keller's record of 102.

In an announcement made on ESPN's SportsCenter, Howard became the fifth player to win Male Athlete of the Year on multiple occasions.

Howard has been a mainstay in the Everton team since joining from Manchester United in 2007

'It's an honour,' Howard told SportsCenter. 'I know the winners on the list who have come before me, so it's special to have my name up there.

'The whole ride with the team for about a month and a half [for the World Cup], when we got together for training camp and we flew down to Brazil, we had a really good time and that made 2014 so special to me.'

The goalkeeping veteran joins defender Marcelo Balboa (1992, 1994), Kasey Keller (1997, 1999 and 2005), forward Landon Donovan (2003, 2004, 2009, 2010) and Clint Dempsey (2007, 2011, 2012) in the list of players who have won the award more than once.

In the vote, Howard received 64 per cent, followed by Jermaine Jones (19 per cent) and Kyle Beckermann (11 per cent).

In his club career, Howard has made 283 appearances for Everton in seven-and-a-half years on Merseyside - the club he joined from Manchester United.
