Donald Trump is suing Bill Maher after the comedian offered to pay out if the celebrity real estate mogul could prove his father was a homosapien and not an ape.

In January, Mr Maher appeared on Jay Leno's show and announced that he would donate $5 million to charity if Mr Trump provided evidence that he was not the 'spawn of his mother having sex with orangutan.'

Trump produced his birth certificate to show both his parents were indeed human and now he is taking the comedian to court to force Maher to pay up.

Bring it: Bill Maher (left) joked on the 'Tonight Show' in January that he would pay $5 million to charity if Donald Trump released his birth certificate

Demands: Donald Trump has called on Bill Maher to quickly pay up on the $5 million he offered as a challenge on Jay Leno's show, after Maher claimed he was the child of an orangutan (right)

'I
don’t know whether I will win or lose the Bill Maher lawsuit but had an
obligation to sue for charity,' Mr Trump said in a statement on Monday.

'He promised me $5 million for 
charity if I provided certain information. Well, I provided the 
information. He didn’t pay. So today I sue Bill Maher for $5 million for
charity,' he said, calling into 'Fox and Friends.'

'I don't think he was joking. He said
it with venom. That was venom. That wasn't a joke. In fact, he was 
nervous when he said it; it was a pathetic delivery. But he said, "I 
will give," and said, "I will accept,"' he added.

Maher made his bet on 'The Tonight Show 
with Jay Leno' on January 8, to mock Trump's maligned YouTube 
announcement last October in which Trump said he would donate $5 
million of his own money to charity if President Obama would release his
college records.

Evidence: Lawyers for Donald Trump were swift to issue the property billionaire's birth certificate - releasing it the day after Maher's challenge

Appearing on the NBC late night show, Mr Maher joked about Trump, the host of NBC's Celebrity Apprentice.

He suggested the multimillion dollar prize could be directed to the charity of Trump's choice, naming the 'Hair Club for Men' or 'The 
Institute for Incorrigible Douchebaggery' as potential recipients.

Comparing
Trump to an orangutan, Maher was drawing a comparison between the 
famously sandy hair of the New York billionaire and the great ape that 
roams the jungles of South East Asia.

In
addition to calling Trump the son of an orangutan, Maher labeled Trump a
'liar' and a 'racist' and a 'douche bag' as he reacted to some 
derogatory tweets that Trump had posted online about him.

The comedian accused Trump of not even writing the tweets himself, but palming them off as a job to a 'syphilitic monkey.'

Monkey claim: Speaking to Leno in January, Maher openly mocked Trump's failed attempt in October (right) to persuade President Obama to release his college and passport records

But Trump accepted the challenge.

Shortly thereafter, Scott S. Balber,
a lawyer for Trump, 66, sent the host of HBO's Real Time with Bill 
Maher a letter with the property magnate's birth certificate attached 
and asked the comedian, who is estimated to be worth $40 million, to come 
up with the cash and honor his ultimatum.

The letter came with a birth 
certificate attached 'demonstrating that he is the son of Fred Trump, 
not an orangutan. Please remit the $5 million to Mr Trump immediately.'

Trump 
indicated he wants to give $1 million each to charities for the 
Hurricane Sandy Victims, The Police Athletic League, The American Cancer
Society, The March of Dimes and the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute.

Proof: Mr Obama released his birth certificate in April of 2012, to show he was indeed born in the U.s.

Trump had brought publicity to the 
'birther' movement, that openly questioned the legitimacy of Mr Obama's 
American citizenship, during the 2012 presidential election.

He called for the president to release his birth certificate, which Mr Obama did in April 2012.

Even after viewing the birth certificate, showing the president was indeed born in the U.S. - a requirement detailed in Section 1 of Article Two of the United States Constitution - Trump still expressed his doubt.

So he announced in October that he 
was calling on Mr Obama to release his college records, in addition to 
his passport information.

Members of the birther movement had 
suggested that Obama had attended California's Occidental College as a foreign 
exchange student, under the name Barry Soetoro.

Others have claimed that his Harvard 
Law School degree was funded by a foreign sponsor, Saudi adviser Khalid 
Al-Mansour, and not financed by student loans, as Mr Obama has oft 
stated.

LOL: Following Donald Trump's offer to pay $5 million to a charity of his choice, President Obama laughed off any suggestion that he reveal his college or passport records

'Barack Obama 
is the least transparent president in the history of this country,' said
Trump in his YouTube video released in October.

'I'm very honored to have gotten him to release his long-form birth certificate or whatever it may be.'

'If
Barack Obama opens up and gives his college records and application and
if he gives his passport applications and records, I will give to a 
charity of his choice - inner-city children in Chicago, American Cancer 
Society, AIDS research, anything he wants - a check immediately for $5 
million.'

The president did not respond to Trump's challenge.

In his own appearance on Leno last October, Mr Obama did joke the bad blood between himself and Trump stems back 
to an argument 'when we were growing up together in Kenya.'
