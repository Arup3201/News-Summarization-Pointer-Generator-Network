Fittingly for a style icon, Isabella Blow’s clothes were eye-catching and eccentric. They were sights to be reckoned with.

And now Somerset House is set to celebrate the muse and stylist with an exhibition displaying 100 pieces from her wardrobe.

Isabella Blow: Fashion Galore! will highlight her aristocratic 
background, growing up at the family seat in Cheshire, her championing 
of Treacy and McQueen, and her love of the British countryside.

Blow, who died in 2007, was 
celebrated for discovering fashion designer Alexander McQueen and 
milliner Philip Treacy. She built up a significant personal collection 
of their work, as well as that of Hussein Chalayan and Julien Macdonald,
among others.

Bespoke mannequins dressed in full outfits worn by Blow will demonstrate her unique style.

Designers whose pieces will be on show in the exhibition include Alexander McQueen, Fendi, Philip Treacy, Dior, Prada, Viktor and Rolf, Manolo Blahnik and Marni.

Blow started her 30 year career auspiciously as an assistant to Anna Wintour at US Vogue. Even then, she steered clear of the conventional.

At Blow's memorial service, Wintour said that when Blow worked for Vogue she did everything fabulously, even cleaning Wintour's desk with Perrier water and Chanel perfume.

In the Nineties, Blow was Fashion Director of The Sunday Times, after which she moved to Tatler, again as Fashion Director.

She discovered models Sophie Dahl and Stella Tenant, and worked with major photographers like Steven Meisel and David LaChapelle.

She revelled in shocking people with daring outfits: she once wore a fish-smelling, crystal-encrusted lobster on her head to a fashion show.

For her wedding, she wore a deep purple medieval robe that she matched with a gold mesh, helmet-esque headpiece.

But she began to suffer from depression, and in 2007, diagnosed with bipolar disorder and ovarian cancer, Blow committed suicide aged 48.

Close friend and distant relative Daphne Guinness said: 'This exhibition is, to me, a bittersweet event.'

The artist and heiress, who bought Blow's wardrobe in its entirety in 2010, added: 'Isabella Blow made our world more vivid, trailing colour with every pace she took. It is a sorrier place for her absence.

'When I visited her beloved clothes in a storage room in South Kensington, it seemed quite clear the collection would be of immense value to a great many people.

'I do believe that in choosing to exhibit them we've done the right thing - and that it is what she would have wanted. I am doing this in memory of a dear friend, in the hope that her legacy may continue to aid and inspire generations of designers to come.'

Guinness is the founder of the Isabella Blow Foundation, which promotes fashion, encourages young talent, and supports charities promoting mental health. In partnership with Central Saint Martins, the Isabella Blow Foundation collaborated with Somerset House to present Blow’s collection.

The show is to run at Somerset House in London from November 20 to March 2, 2014.
