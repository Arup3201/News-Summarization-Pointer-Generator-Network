A mother who died from lung cancer could have been saved had doctors treated her three years earlier, her family have claimed.

Linda Renshaw, 61, had a chest X-ray at the Royal Blackburn Hospital 
 in 2008 which showed the early signs of cancer.

But she was nothing was followed up and she died in May 2011 after the disease spread to her brain.

Before she died, the mother-of-three launched a medical 
negligence legal battle, claiming she could have been saved had she received the appropriate care.

Arthur Renshaw's wife Linda (pictured) died after her lung cancer went untreated for three years, allowing the disease to spread

She told her family she had instructed solicitors because 'she didn't want it to happen to anyone else'.

The couple's case is one of 45 against
the trust launched by solicitors Manchester-based solicitors Pannone in
the last five years - 27 of which are still active.

Last week the Government announced an
independent inquiry after the trust recorded higher than expected 
mortality rates for two successive years.

It is one of five trusts nationally to be investigated and was 13 per cent above expectations.

Mrs Renshaw, who also had three step-children, had the initial chest X-ray at the Royal Blackburn 
Hospital after she suffered a heart attack in July 2008.

Her husband Arthur, 71, claims that four days 
later, a doctor spotted the tumour and a note was sent to the ward she 
had been on to follow it up.

He said: 'They are supposed to have computer systems where the information was passed to the GP, but it wasn't logged.'

Mr Renshaw, with daughter Stephanie, claims doctors failed to follow up his wife's cancer at an early stage

In 2010, Mrs Renshaw, who worked as a cleaner and lunch time assistant, went to her GP 
and was told she was having seizures. After initially being treated for 
sinus problems, she was sent to hospital for another X-ray.

Mr Renshaw, of West Bradford, 
Lancashire, said: 'The following day a 
doctor came and said to her: "I'm sorry to inform you that you have advanced lung cancer and it has spread to your brain".

'We told him Linda had had an X-ray in
2008 and he said "yes, when you had that X-ray the doctor spotted the 
early signs but nothing was followed up".

'He gave her five months to live. I was numb, but Linda was full of hope that she would beat the cancer.'

He added that his wife was so determined to fight the cancer that she turned to alternative medicine, spending £500 a month on treatments.

Mr Renshaw said: 'Nothing can bring Linda back but she wanted me to fight for justice'

Now he says East Lancashire Hospitals NHS Trust had admitted neglect and causation of death.

He said: 'Linda instructed the solicitor because she didn't want it to happen to anyone else.

He said: 'She made me promise to see it through to the end so that it didn't happen to another family."Nothing can bring her back but she wanted me to fight for justice.

'I got called to a meeting with the clinical director. They said "we failed you wife". They have admitted neglect and causation of death.

He claims an independent consultant said Mrs Renshaw could have been cured, saying: 'It's devastating. I will never get over it. We were looking forward to retiring.' 

Mrs Renshaw was buried in her mother of the bride outfit she had planned to wear for her daughter Tracy's wedding in July.

Marged Berry, of Pannone Solicitors, said there had been a failure to follow up on a chest X-ray which clearly showed early cancerous changes in summer 2008.

But Mrs Renshaw was not actually diagnosed until early 2011, by which time the cancer was terminal.

She said: 'We are disturbed by the number of cases that we see. Arthur Renshaw's case is an example of that. It's such a simple error that could have meant that Mrs Renshaw survived.

'The trust has admitted breach of duty of care and conceded Mrs Renshaw would have lived, had she received the right treatment.

'The inquiry is welcomed because it will lead to a rethink of policies and procedures and better patient care.

'Although we have a substantial number of cases against East Lancashire Hospitals NHS Trust, we can't draw any conclusions. We have to wait for the inquiry.'

Lynn Wissett, deputy chief executive for East Lancashire Hospitals NHS Trust, said: 'The trust has met with Mr Renshaw and a detailed investigation into his concerns was undertaken.

'We would again offer our sincere condolences to Mr Renshaw. The matter is now subject to litigation and the trust and the National Health Service Litigation Authority are working with Mr Renshaw's legal representatives.'
