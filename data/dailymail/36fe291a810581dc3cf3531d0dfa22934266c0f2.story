A hard-hitting new campaign to get black British voters to the polling booths has been launched with the help of a host of black stars.

Homeland actor David Harewood, musician Tinie Tempah, former Arsenal captain Sol Campbell and Paralympic athlete Ade Adepitan have been photographed with their faces painted white as part of the striking campaign by Operation Black Vote.

The campaign aims to encourage black Britons to register to vote before it's too late – with the voting registration deadline on April 20.

Four posters have been released with photographs taken by leading photographer John Rankin Waddell.

A separate online advert starring Harewood, made by famous ad agency Saatchi and Saatchi, has also been released.

A survey of voters in the 2010 general election put the turnout rate for white voters at 67 per cent but only 51 per cent for non-white voters.

The former Premiership star said he agree to pose for the campaign to encourage black and Asian communities to use their votes on May 7 or their voices will not be heard.

He said: 'I agreed to do the Operation Black Vote pictures because I wanted to highlight the problem with some sections of Britain who are not registering to vote for their future.'

Campbell posed for a photograph alongside the caption: 'If you don't register to vote, you're taking the colour out of Britain.'

Campbell, 40, last month ruled out standing for the Conservatives in Kensington after Sir Malcolm Rifkind announced he would be standing down.

At the time he said his 'ambitions lie elsewhere in the political arena' which led to speculation he could run for London Mayor.

Homeland's David Harewood said black Britons were being sidelined from politics.

He said: 'If you want change, you have to vote for it. In order to vote, you have to register. We can't continue to stand on sidelines of the British democratic system, we are a part of it and our voices matter.'

Operation Black Vote also launched a 2015 general election manifesto with the aim of 'reclaiming democracy, empowering citizens and fighting race equalities'.

It says that in the past black and minority ethnic (BME) groups presented a broad range of 'key policy demands' to all parties, but adds: 'Our experience shows that whilst all parties express interest in our proposals during elections, this interest soon evaporates once in power.'

Instead OBV has created a list of manifesto points of its own, including automatic voter registration linked to the National Insurance system, the introduction of e-voting and proportional representation, voting from the age of 16, state funding of parties and a 'minister for race equality' in the Cabinet.
