A woman driver was forced to dramatically stop her car on the fast lane of a busy motorway in a terrifying road rage incident, police have said.

The victim had been driving her silver BMW on the anti-clockwise stretch of the M25 when a blue, foreign-registered Mercedes started tailgating her vehicle.

The Mercedes, believed to be a left-hand drive, then undertook the BMW Z4 before pulling back in front of it.

A man then got out of the Mercedes, walked up to the BMW and punched the windscreen, causing it to crack.

He then got back in the car, which had a woman passenger inside, and drove off.

The shaken victim was able to safely move her vehicle on to the hard shoulder before summoning help.

The crazed Mercedes driver was being hunted by police today following the incident at around 8.30pm on Friday evening.

'Forcing a vehicle to stop on the fast lane of a busy motorway is an extremely dangerous thing to do and this incident could have had serious consequences,' said Detective Sergeant Gary Hutchings, of Surrey Police.

'Fortunately the woman was not injured but she has understandably been left very shaken by what happened.

'I am appealing for anyone who was driving on this section of the M25 last night and may have seen what happened to come forward.

'The Mercedes is quite distinctive and we believe that other drivers may have seen it driving at speed on the motorway, so I would appeal for any witnesses to come forward.'
