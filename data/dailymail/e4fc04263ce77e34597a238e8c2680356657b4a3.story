Southampton and Newcastle United climbed more Premier League places than any other club this season – but Liverpool were the big points improvers.

Brendan Rodgers' side missed out on a first title in 24 years but the 23 points they added to last season’s tally represented the most significant gain.

Liverpool would also have been the first team in Premier League history to make the jump from seventh to champions had Manchester City not pipped them to the crown.

Saints march on: Adam Lallana was key as Southampton climbed six places

Southampton’s campaign has been celebrated in recent months and their growth of 15 points was bettered only by the men from Anfield.

In the process the Saints leapt from 14th to 8th but were some 13 points short of returning Europa League football.

But the surprise improvers are Newcastle. Their manager Alan Pardew has come in for heavy criticism of late and, with seven defeats from their final eight matches, there have been calls for him to go. The Magpies, however, leapt six places from last season’s 16th to record a top-10 finish.

The biggest losers, meanwhile, were Manchester United. They dropped a staggering 25 points on their total from last year’s title-winning effort and slumped six places.

But no club plummeted further than West Brom, the Baggies having lost nine positions as they fell from eightth to 17th.
