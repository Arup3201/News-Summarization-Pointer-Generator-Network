Justice Secretary Chris Grayling said he would make 'no apologies for putting sex offender where they deserve to be'

The number of sex attackers behind bars has doubled in only a decade – with eight jails now containing no other type of inmate.

The huge increase has in part been fuelled by convictions in historic abuse cases.

In recent months, high-profile figures – including Stuart Hall, Max Clifford and Rolf Harris – have been imprisoned for crimes dating back decades.

Prison officials have had to set up a string of new programmes to cope with the explosion in the sex offender population – which now stands at 11,150. 

It is the equivalent of one in every eight inmates and has leapt by 650 in the past year alone.

A total of eight jails have been converted or opened that are exclusively for paedophiles, rapists and other sex offenders. 

Officials said holding sex offenders together makes them more likely to engage in treatment programmes.

These include the use of ‘anti-libidinal’ drug treatments used to lessen prisoners’ sexual urges.

A pilot project using the drugs is to be rolled out across prisons after proving successful at HMP Whatton near Nottingham, ministers will announce today.

Justice Secretary Chris Grayling said: ‘As a Government we make no apologies for putting sex offenders where they deserve to be – in jail.

‘But when they are there it is important that we deal with their offending behaviour – that means programmes consistent with the best evidence, targeted at those who pose the greatest threat.

‘I don’t want a one-size-fits-all approach which costs the taxpayer lots of money and doesn’t reduce the risk posed by the most serious offenders.’

However, to cope with the huge increase of inmates, special treatment programmes are no longer being targeted at low-risk offenders.

The move is likely to spark concern among penal reform groups about a lack of resources inside Britain’s packed jails.

Stuart Hall, Max Clifford and Rolf Harris are among figures to be jailed in recent months for historic sex abuse allegations, and such offenders now make up one in eight prisoners

But officials last night insisted that international evidence showed it would be more effective to focus on more prolific offenders, who will pose a greater risk to the public on release.

The Ministry of Justice says investment in all offending behaviour programmes – including sex offender treatment, drug treatment and domestic violence programmes – has increased by £280,000 in the past 12 months in prison and by £1.4million for those delivered in the community.

There has been a huge increase in investigations into historic allegations of sexual assault since the full scale of Jimmy Savile’s crimes came to light following the former DJ’s death in October 2011.

Operation Yewtree was launched to investigate his crimes but was widened to include other alleged offenders and by October 2012 police reported that more than 400 lines of inquiry had been assessed. 

A number of other former celebrities remain on bail or are awaiting trial for sexual offences.

As well as the increase in historic cases, another factor behind the surging population of sex offenders is tougher sentencing.

The average length of sentence for those convicted of sexual offences has gone up from 40 months in 2003 to more than 59 months in 2013

Alongside Whatton, the prisons wholly dealing with sex offenders are Albany, Isle of Wight; Usk, South Wales; Bure, near Norwich; Ashfield, near Bristol; Stafford; Rye Hill, near Rugby; and Littlehey, Cambridgeshire.
