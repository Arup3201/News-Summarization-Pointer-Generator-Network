For those who struggled to unsee the horrific images of fur seals forcing themselves on female king penguins, a graphic artist has come up with something to replace them.

Los Angeles-based graphic artist has imagined what the potential result of these unholy alliances would look like, and unsurprisingly, they're rather cute.

Sarah Lee DeRemer, 25, photo-shopped penguins and seals together to create the hypothetical hybrid offspring.

However, these cute images have a very sincere undertone, following last week's revelation that fur seals have been raping king penguins on a small island off the coast of South Africa.

The disturbing behaviour of a group of fur seals on Marion Island, sub-Antarctic Indian Ocean, was revealed by a group of South African scientists last week.

Astonishing footage captured by the group showed an enormous seal attacking a female king penguin and forcing itself on her.

The scientists said they have made four separate observations of individual Antarctic fur seals sexually assaulting adult king penguins as they tried to resist.

After three of the incidents, the seals let the penguins go - but following one attack, the seal killed the penguin and ate it. 

'Given the awful news stories of penguins being raped by fur seals, I felt it my hybridizing obligation to explore the hypothetical offspring of these assaults,' Ms DeRemer explains.
