Indians pitcher Chris Perez and his wife face drug charges after police intercepted a package of marijuana being delivered to their Ohio home.

Disguised as a USPS postal worker, a postal investigator went to the couple's rented Rocky River home with police on Tuesday to question them about a suspicious package.

When Perez's wife, Melanie, was presented with the parcel addressed to Brody Baum, she allegedlyÂ  claimed it was for her dog.

The priority mail parcel contained  163.9 grams of marijuana, packed into four zip lock bags that had been covered in Vaseline and put in two containers that were then wrapped in a shirt, according to Newsnet5.

It had been address to 'Baum' which is Mrs Perez's maiden name, and had been posted from Los Angeles.

The smell of marijuana alerted the postal service, according to a USPS report. Jet, a drug-sniffing dog from Cleveland, confirmed that drugs were inside.

At first police say the baseball player tried to blame a fan for sending the drugs.

However, after being served with a search warrant by Westshore Enforcement Bureau, Perez allegedly took officers to the basement, where he pointed out two jars of marijuana and drug paraphernalia, which he admitted was for personal use, the Rocky River police report said.

According to the Morning Journal, before Perez moved to the Rocky River home with his wife and two children, the police had been called to the rented home several times.

Police said this had stopped once the previous tenants left and the Perez family moved in.

Terry Gilbert, the couple's attorney, told MLB.com: 'My clients Chris and Melanie Perez are facing low-level misdemeanor possession charges. These are accusations only ... they have not been found guilty of any crime.'

He added: 'They will be entering not 
guilty pleas. We ask that people not rush to judgment. We are confident 
of a favorable outcome.'

Rocky River Police confirmed the couple 
had been charged with a fourth degree misdemeanor and that it was a 
first-time offense for them.

Indians general manager Chris Antonetti said: 'We have talked with Chris and are currently in the process of gathering additional information. We will not have any additional comment at this time.'

Perez, who earned $4.5 million last year, is due to return to court with his wife on June 19.
