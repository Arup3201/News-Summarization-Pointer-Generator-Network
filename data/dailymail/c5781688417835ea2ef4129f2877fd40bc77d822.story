An SUV driver who allegedly deliberately ran over and killed a Muslim teenager outside a Missouri mosque had an anti-Islamic message painted on the rear window of his car, police have said.

Ahmed Aden, 34, is accused of intentionally swerving into Abdisamad Sheikh-Hussein, 15, as he climbed into a silver car outside the Somali Center in Kansas City on Thursday evening.

He struck the  teenager - also known as 'Adam' - at high speed, nearly severing his legs. The victim was rushed to hospital with serious blood loss. But despite medics' best efforts, he shortly died.

Now, police have revealed that Aden had scrawled the words: 'Quran is a virus disease woreste than Ebola (sic)' in white paint on the back of his car before crashing into the unsuspecting teenager.

In an email, Kansas City police spokesman, Darin Snapp, told The Associated Press that the suspect's black SUV had been seen cruising around the area by patrol officers in late October.

It had already been painted with the message comparing the Quran to the deadly Ebola virus, he said. The disease has so far killed more than 5,000 people, mainly in three West African nations.

According to Fox 4 News, the suspect had also been harassing the mosque's Muslim community with anti-Islamic taunts and violent threats and messages in the months leading up to the 'murder'.

'One of the messages was that Islam is worse than Ebola,' 13-year-old Mohamed Ahmed, of Kansas City, said. ''I would have thought the police would have taken care of it, but they didn't.'

Abdisamad, a sophomore, was reportedly heading to play basketball on Thursday when Aden crashed into him so violently that he 'flew through the air', according to a probable cause affidavit.

Following the smash at 5.20pm, Aden, a convenience store manager and local Somali of Christian faith, reportedly ran over the teenager's body, before stepping out of the SUV brandishing a knife.

When police arrived at the scene, he started swinging around what appeared to be a baseball bat, it is said. One witness told officers Aden threatened them with a handgun as he tried to flee on foot.

Abdisamad, who was rushed into surgery at Children’s Mercy Hospital following the incident, was taken off life support by his family later that evening after doctors declared him to be brain dead.

On Friday, Aden was charged with first-degree murder for the crash, which the FBI is investigating as a potential hate crime. He is currently being held in Jackson County jail.

FBI spokesman, Bridget Patton, said: 'Federal agents are assisting in the investigation and have opened this matter as a federal civil rights investigation as a potential hate crimes violation.'

Bowed in prayer: Somali men gather to pray the day after the 15-year-old was allegedly struck by Aden

On Saturday afternoon, a funeral for Abdisamad - who led prayers at the mosque near Admiral Blvd and The Paseo the night before his death - was held at the Islamic Society of Greater Kansas City. 

It came a day after dozens of the victim's grief-stricken friends and family members gathered for a prayer service, where Abdisamad was remembered for being kind and faithful.

After the service, Mohamed Farah, 50, a  friend of the boy's family, told reporters he had called police more than once in October about Aden, who was 'acting suspiciously' around the mosque.

'I feel like I lost a part of my body,' he said, referring to Abdisamad's death.

Bakar Abdalla, 31, of Kansas City, added that Aden had been frequenting the area with hateful messages, describing the suspect as 'a bullet in a gun waiting to be triggered'.

Meanwhile, Khadra Dirir, the victim's aunt, said her nephew often studied the Quran and had given a group prayer the night he died. 

'If you asked him a verse, he could tell the chapter,' she said.

According to the probable cause affidavit, Aden initially told authorities that he had lost control of his vehicle and accidentally swerved into the Staley High School sophomore.

However, he later claimed he crashed into the teenager because he thought the boy looked like someone who had threatened him several days earlier, it is said.

No attorney was listed for Aden in online court records.
