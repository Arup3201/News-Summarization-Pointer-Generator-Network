Per Mertesacker expresses the point succinctly. The Arsenal defender, who takes on Cristiano Ronaldo and Portugal on Monday, knows there is a degree of impatience in Germany as Joachim Low’s national team begin their World Cup campaign in Salvador.

In recent tournaments, Germany have been playing the unfamiliar role of eager young hopefuls. In 2006, as host nation, they feared they would be chronically embarrassed at their own party, yet they ended up heroic losers in an epic semi-final with Italy.

In 2010, the young team that ripped apart England in Bloemfontein, with Mesut Ozil, Thomas Muller, Sami Khedira, Jerome Boateng and Manuel Neuer to the fore, was full of World Cup debutants who were stopped only by the irresistible Spain, again in the semi-final.

Today’s players have no such mitigation should they fail. They are no longer a team for the future; this generation have to deliver now.

‘We finished the last two World Cups in third position and that is really consistent,’ says Mertesacker. ‘What we need in Germany after all these years is a title as well. We’re talking all about titles and trophies.’

Indeed. It is 1996 since they last delivered a trophy, winning the European Championship at  Wembley. Granted, in the intervening years they have reached the World Cup final in 2002 and semis in 2006 and 2010, as well as reaching the Euro 2008 final and Euro 2012 semi-final. What England would give for failure on that scale? Nevertheless, this team are now experienced tournament players, many of them Champions League  winners.

‘The level of this team is really high and that comes with experience,’ says Lukas Podolski, Mertesacker’s Arsenal team-mate. In 2006, levels of expectation weren’t so high. Now they are. Other teams look at us differently. In 2006 and 2010 we were the hunters; now we’re the hunted.’

The captain remains the unflappable Philip Lahm, who has been transformed from a full-back into an outstanding holding midfielder under Pep Guardiola at Bayern Munich.

‘I like the fact that expectations are so high,’ says Lahm. ‘Firstly, it’s normal: we’ve had two third-place finishes and we have to try to improve on that in Brazil. This team have been together for a long time, we have come very far.

‘Of course they want us to win the World Cup back home. Maybe it would be easier for us if there were no expectations, if we were able to play with a sense of freedom. But that’s not our reality. I’d much rather be considered one of the favourites than one of the underdogs.’

Lahm is part of the core of Bayern players, which includes Muller, Bastian Schweinsteiger and, more recently, Boateng, Neuer and Toni Kroos, who were gaining a reputation as gallant losers. With their country they lost the Euro 2008 final, 2010 World Cup and Euro 2012 semis; with their club they had been defeated in the 2010 and 2012 Champions League finals. When the big games came, Bayern’s Germany players seemed to be serial losers.

So the all-German 2013 Champions League final between Bayern and Borussia Dortmund at Wembley was hugely significant. Bayern’s players ended their losing run and Mertesacker agrees that Germany’s rise in prowess in the Champions League has made a considerable  difference to the national team.

‘What Munich achieved by reaching three finals in four years is adorable,’ he adds. ‘Five or 10 years ago there was a massive gap between Germany and the leading Champions League countries.’

As well Portugal and Ghana, Germany also face the USA, now coached by Jurgen Klinsmann, their former manager. Klinsmann gave Mertesacker his debut and recruited Low as No 2, pushing his assistant to take his job when he left.

Mertesacker adds: ‘For those who were together with Jurgen over a couple of years, it’s going to be a very special game. He gave us our confidence back. This German side needed Jurgen when he started in 2004 and then in 2006.

‘A lot of memories will come back when we face him. I am looking forward to it. Everyone is grateful that we spent time with him.’
