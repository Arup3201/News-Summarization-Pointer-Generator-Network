Mercedes boss Toto Wolff suffered a fractured shoulder, collar bone, elbow and wrist during a road bike crash on Tuesday.

Wolff was cycling with members of the Mercedes team when the incident took place along the River Danube ahead of this weekend’s race in Hungary.

Neither Lewis Hamilton or Nico Rosberg, who won Sunday’s German Grand Prix to extend his lead in the drivers’ championship to 14 points, were involved.

Wolff had a metal plate inserted in his wrist, but is still expected to be on the Mercedes pit wall for the final race ahead of the four-week summer break this weekend.

‘We’ve decided to leave it to the pros now,’ said Wolff. ‘Lewis and Nico are better wheel to wheel at 300km/h that we are at 30km/h.’

Susie Wolff, the Williams reserve driver and wife of the Mercedes team boss, then posted a picture of him on Twitter where he is seen sporting a brace on his arm and a sling.

‘My husband the hero,’ she said. ‘As we know, boys, will be boys. Looks like I am on nurse duty for the next few weeks.’

Earlier this week, Wolff became the first team boss to openly criticise the double points system which will be introduced for the first time at this year’s finale in Abu Dhabi.

‘I don’t think it’s fair. I don’t think we should have done it,’ he said.

‘The reason we did was because the commercial rights holder is head of sponsorship and he cares about the TV audience and the need to keep the excitement until the end, the last race.

‘As I said, it looks like he might be right, that the last race is going to be the decisive one, and I would be very surprised if the audiences weren’t considerably higher than they would normally be.’

Should a driver lose by such a system, Wolff believes it would be hard for that man to bear. 'Neither of them will care if they won it that way,' he added.

'But the one who loses on double points will need some psychological treatment - although we're not there yet.'
