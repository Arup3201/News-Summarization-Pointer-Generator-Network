The families of victims killed during the Sandy Hook massacre have refused to accept a former Major League player's apology after he suggested the horrifying incident was a 'hoax' on Twitter.  

Retired Atlanta Braves third baseman Chipper Jones tweeted on Friday night that the December 2012 shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown was a hoax and then asked, 'What else are we being lied to about?'

After other social media users began to rip the ex-slugger, the 42-year-old deleted the tweet and apologized for what he had written. 

However Cristina Hassinger, 30, whose mother Dawn Hochsprung was the principal at the school, has said she is disappointed a man supposed to be a role model was promoting such a theory and claims he has caused more 'conspiracy theorists' to harass them.

In response, she tweeted the athlete inviting him to her home so she could see her mother's bullet-hole-ridden clothes.

She then suggested that If Jones is truly sorry, he should make a donation in honor of the victims. 

Hassinger told the New York Daily News: 'For more than two years now, my family and the other families of Sandy Hook have been dealing with conspiracy theorists.

'They harass us, saying it was all a hoax. They accuse us of being in on the hoax a lot of the time. So it’s really so disappointing to see someone who is supposed to be an American role model come out and promote the Sandy Hook hoax theory.'

She added the post prompted other Twitter users to abuse the families of victims.  

Jones' remark was likely based on a since-debunked report on InfoWars.com that claimed FBI crime statistics show no murders occurred in Newtown in 2012.

Twenty-six people, 20 children and six adults, were killed during the shooting. 

Shooter Adam Lanza also killed his mother and then himself in the violence.

Jones' tweets have gotten him in trouble in the past. 

He also apologized for making an insensitive comment and suggesting the use of alligators to attack illegal immigrants in June of 2013. 

The career .304 hitter said he was just trying to be funny but did call the remark 'offensive' and 'distasteful' in his apology. 

Hassinger said conspiracy theorists claiming the massacre was a hoax have been harassing them for two years now 

She then asked the apologetic athlete to visit a website dedicated to supporting families who lost loved ones in the 2012 tragedy
