Jose Mourinho may have apologised to Kevin Friend after Chelsea's victory over Watford but the referee is not likely to be on Didier Drogba's Christmas card list this year.

The Chelsea striker posted a picture on Instagram of his ripped shirt with the words: 'No penalty, no yellow card, only thing I got was two minutes out of the pitch because…I had to change shirt.'

Chelsea went on to win the FA Cup third-round tie 3-0 and Mourinho, who spoke of a 'campaign' against Chelsea after the draw at Southampton last week, praised Friend for his performance.

Friend played advantage rather than awarding a penalty after Craig Cathcart appeared to handball in the box and Loic Remy slammed home the rebound to put Chelsea 2-0 up.

'I want to apologise for my earlier comments in some television (interviews). What the referee did was great refereeing,' Mourinho said.

'He saw that it was a penalty, he was going to give a penalty, but he saw the ball was going to Remy. And he waited a couple of seconds.

'He told me that if Remy didn't control the ball well or the ball goes over the bar or the ball is lost, he would have given the penalty.

'I was complaining, but it was good refereeing by Kevin.'
