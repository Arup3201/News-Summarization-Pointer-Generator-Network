Enough of the pantomime. The Apprentice (BBC1) is over, and should never be allowed back on British screens.

On a scale of one to five, it gets no stars. If it were possible to earn a minus rating, it deserves a score of around - 3.

That’s not just because of the slack-jawed inanity of the contestants, or the grinding repetition of the same clips and scenes for two dreadful months.

Tinpot title: Lord Sugar has spent 12 episodes selecting his 'new business partner'. He wasn't hiring an employee this time; he invested £250,000 in a business, in return for 50 per cent equity

It isn’t just because the BBC has been milking the show to the last rancid drop, squeezing six hours of Apprentice programming into the past fortnight, including a whole segment devoted to childhood retrospectives of the candidates.

All this, despite insipid ratings — the show launched with just six million viewers, a record low, and has struggled to make any gain on that. These figures should, on their own, be sufficient to condemn The Apprentice as television landfill.

Half a century after the Moors Murders, a three-part series, Myra Hindley: The Untold Story, started last night on C5, while ITV was repeating Brady and Hindley: Possession.

We can only trust Ian Brady is not given the satisfaction of watching these programmes.

Worse still is the cossetting of Alan Sugar’s ego. His tinpot title is echoed dozens of times in every episode — the voiceover, the receptionists, the lackeys, the contestants all chant ‘Yes Lord Sugar’,  ‘Thank you Lord Sugar’. And when the former barrow-boy thinks he can get away with it, he starts Lord Sugaring himself.

Recent episodes have seen new ‘business brains’ arriving to swell the chorus of praise. When one candidate commented on her own talents, a shocked lickspittle gasped: ‘Don’t ever compare yourself to Lord Sugar!’

The show’s worst failing is a business one.

Alan Sugar has spent 12 episodes selecting his ‘new business partner’. He wasn’t hiring an employee this time; he invested £250,000 in a business, in return for 50 per cent equity.

Several candidates were promising multi-million-pound growth within five years — such profits are improbable, of course, but the BBC seems to have tossed away any claim to future income streams.

Sugar has already been amply rewarded for his investment. There are plenty of narcissists in the corporate world who would mortgage their country cottages, their Mercs and their own mothers to be touted endlessly on primetime telly as ‘a business icon’.

For him to have the chance of a 1,000 per cent return or more, through a state TV channel, is utterly wrong. The BBC ought surely to have capped his profits, perhaps a maximum of double his money.

Any bank would see that as a fair return. And this flags up the great unasked question of the series: if these candidates have good business plans, why not take them to a conventional investor?

By handing over half their companies, and perhaps sacrificing many millions for the arbitrary seed sum of £250,000, they would almost be better off applying for a pay-day loan.

It was easier to feel sympathy for the 94-stone salt-water crocodiles on Ray Mears’ Close Encounters (ITV) than for Alan Sugar.

The crocs were being hauled out of Darwin harbour on ropes, before duct tape was wound around their jaws and the presenter stood on their heads to subdue them.

‘This is an outstanding example of modern conservation,’ Mears insisted. The captures helped to ‘stop interaction between crocodiles and the public’.

One croc ranger held up a hand to demonstrate what ‘interaction’ looked like: two fingers had been bitten off.

You can’t always blame the reptiles when tragedies happen. One man was photographed attempting to surf on the back of a croc. Two girls were pictured sunbathing on a wire cage containing a snared, and very disgruntled, ‘saltie’.

‘Alcohol is usually involved in these cases,’ Mears told us, straight-faced.

Any boozed up Aussie who survives a croc attack will learn their lesson. But do BBC executives have the same basic common sense not to get bitten again?
