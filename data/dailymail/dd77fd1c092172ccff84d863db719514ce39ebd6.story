From skin cancer to wrinkles, the dangers of baking on the beach are well documented but it seems many women across the globe are failing to take action to avoid them.

A new report into the tanning habits of the world has found Japanese women reported burning the most.

Two thirds (64 per cent) admit to burning their face during the summer months according to new research.

Almost all Britons alter their foundation and moisturiser to include a sunscreen for the summer

Germans, meanwhile, report using sunbeds the most with 70 per cent admitting to baking under a bed at least once.

The survey of 13,831 people has revealed that the 
pale-skinned denizens of the UK are the most likely to wear sunscreen, 
with women living in the US running them a close second.

Almost all Britons were found to be 
super SPF savvy with 95 per cent altering their foundation and 
moisturiser to include a sunscreen for the summer.

More than two thirds (66 per cent) 
prioritise SPF over other product qualities and benefits.

The highest percentage of Britons report using factor 50 on their face and a separate SPF for their lips.

And
 wisely so as more than two thirds (68 per cent) like to be outside in 
the direct sunshine between the peak hours of 11am - 3pm.

Almost half (49 per cent) of Swedish women buy into SPF for the hair

Over the pond, 94 per cent of American subscribers swear by SPF in all products over the summer.

GLOSSYBOX subscribers from the UK, USA, Sweden, France, Germany
 and Japan were invited to took part in the online survey throughout May, and 99 per cent
 of those who did were female.

More than three quarters (77 per cent) of women in France say they feel more attractive with a bronzed glow.

Their
 top concern was found to be protecting their hair from harmful rays 
with 50 per cent buying into thermal hair protectors during the summer.

Almost the same amount (49 per cent) of Swedish women also buy into SPF for the hair.

Whilst Japanese report most burning it's shockingly also them who avoid the sun at all costs the most, with 96 per cent hiding from harmful rays.

Almost all (93 per cent) Japanese also say they protect their skin with a high SPF.

And while Germans love a good sunbed, surprisingly, they recorded the lowest amount of sunburn with just 10 per cent going red.

Worryingly though, it was recorded that a global average of 78 per cent have never had a dermatologist or doctor check out their skin moles.

So what is the best way to protect yourself from the sun?

Surgeon and skin cancer expert, Paul E Banwell FRCS(Plast) suggests that sun protection might be as simple as popping a pill.

'Regular oral Vitamin D supplementation may help guard against skin cancer formation. It is known that Vitamin D is highly photoprotective,' he says.
