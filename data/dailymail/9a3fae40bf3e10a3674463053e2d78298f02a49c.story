A motorist has been arrested on suspicion of drink-driving after he was stopped speeding at 100mph - more than three times the limit.

The driver failed a breath test, blowing a reading of more than double the drink-drive level, after his vehicle was seen travelling at around 100mph in a 30mph limit zone.

Officers arrested the man after pulling him over on a section of the Aston Expressway A38(M) in Birmingham, which had a temporary 30mph restriction at the time.

A motorist was stopped speeding at 100mph, more than three times the temporary 30mph limit, on the Aston Expressway A38(M)

In a tweet early this morning, Central Motorway Police Group said the man had given a reading of 74 micrograms of alcohol in 100ml of breath, more than double the 35 microgram legal limit.

It said: 'Vehicle stopped on a38(m) having been travelling at 100mph in temp 30mph area. Driver arrested for drink driving having blown 74.' 

Another tweet said: 'Two more drink drivers through the night, 1 drew attention to himself by driving in excess of 100mph and was twice over drink drive limit.'

The fastest speeding motorist in Britain is thought to be getaway driver Ben Westwood, 33, who reached speeds of up to 180mph as he fled police during a 65-mile chase in 2012.

During the pursuit on the M6, his stolen Audi RS5 almost outran a police helicopter and left officers in high-performance BMWs trailing in his wake.

Westwood was jailed for a total of nine years after he was found guilty of dangerous driving, conspiracy to burgle and conspiracy to steal. 

Before him, Timothy Brady was thought to be Britain's fastest speeder.

He was jailed for 10 weeks after admitting clocking up 172mph while driving his new Porsche 911 on the A420 in Oxfordshire in 2007.
