BT Sport has been forced to apologised after football pundit David Ginola was caught on camera making made a rude hand gesture.

The former French international reacted badly to mocking comments about his dress sense from presenter Jake Humphrey ahead of the Newcastle-Liverpool fixture.

Humphrey, in 
sharp-fitted trousers with black pumps, turned fashion critic when he 
noticed Ginola's worn-effect jeans and mould-coloured trainers.

'David, clearly wasn't expecting to be seen full length,' said Humphreys, much to Ginola's irritation, as seen on BT Sport.

The former Spurs, Newcastle and Everton player then made his gesture as Humphreys turned away

Co-presenter Owen Hargreaves struggled to contain his laughter, but Steve McManaman kept a straight face.

The newly-created 
sports channel said it had received complaints from viewers but would not comment on how many.

In a statement, it said: 'BT Sport would like to apologise for any offence 
that was caused during this morning's broadcast.

'David Ginola apologised straight afterwards as he realised this was an inappropriate action.'

Ginola later tweeted: 'Heading home 
from a cracking live game @btsport @mrjakehumphrey. So terribly sorry 
for my rude unacceptable gesture, didn't know i was live.

'I
very humbly ask everyone @btsport @mrjakehumphrey & all the fans to
accept my wholehearted apologies for the rude, unacceptable gesture.'

The Frenchman, now 46, played for Newcastle, Tottenham Hotspur, Aston Villa and Everton before retiring in 2002.

He is well-known for being a style guru, previously modelling for cosmetic company L'Oreal.
