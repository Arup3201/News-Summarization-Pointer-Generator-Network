Birthday boy Mario Balotelli prepared himself to celebrate his 24th birthday - by riding on a Segway during his Italian holiday

The AC Milan striker, who turned 24 on Tuesday, drove the two-wheeled, self-balancing vehicle while on his phone as he relaxes in Versilia, Italy.

He then posted a photo on Instagram accompanied with the caption: 'I enjoy it!'

Balotelli also tweeted a thank you message to all the fans who had wished him a happy birthday, with a link to an Instagram selfie of him smiling away. 

The controversial forward was part of the Italy squad who were eliminated from the World Cup in the group stages and he has also been linked with a move away from Milan this summer. 

Liverpool, Arsenal and Juventus have all been touted as possible destinations for the former Manchester City forward should he leave AC. 

Balotelli, of course, is famous for his mad-cap antics and this latest episode seems rather tame when compared with past misdemeanours.

Most famously, while at City he set fireworks off in his house, an incident which came to light not long before a Manchester derby. This led to the revelation of the 'Why Always Me?' T-shirt when he scored at Old Trafford.

It is hoped he showed more co-ordination riding the Segway across the hotel lobby than he did trying to put his bib on ahead of a Europa League tie against Dynamo Kiev in 2011. 

His latest off-field venture was starring in a Puma advert with Usain Bolt and a bevvy of women in a hot tub.

Pointing the way: Balotelli's future at AC Milan has been the result of much speculation this summer
