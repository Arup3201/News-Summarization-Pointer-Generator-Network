Over 100 homeowners were issued threatening letters telling them their houses were to be bulldozed in a 'breathtaking error' on the part of a local council, it has emerged.

The residents, many of whom are elderly, were warned they would face criminal prosecution if they did not go along with the sale of their houses to a council contractor.

Hampshire County Council has apologised for the letters which detailed plans for the new Stubbington bypass.

Homeowners were left horrified when they received this threatening letter which claimed their houses would be bulldozed to make way for a new bypass

Around 150 of 500 drafted letters were mistakenly issued to local residents on Friday morning, with recipients being told they had just 14 days to respond.

Council representatives have reportedly spent the weekend delivering letters of apology to those affected, claiming the notice was meant only for a handful of local landowners.

Councillor Sean Woodward, executive member for transport said: 'I would like to apologise to residents who received letters and for any distress this may have caused.

'A breakdown of communication between the council and the consultants led to an inaccurate letter being mistakenly issued.

'I have asked that the exact circumstances be investigated and measures put in place to ensure nothing like this can happen in the future.'

His apology seems to have fallen on deaf ears however, with some homeowners struggling to understand why such an error could occur in the first place.

Residents of Burnt House Lane in Stubbington were left dumbstruck by the letters which have been described as a 'breathtaking error'

One recipient, Barry Gee said: 'It is a bit shocking for anybody... A mistake is a mistake, but why did it happen?

'You have to wonder whatâ€™s the real reason why they sent so many letters? How did the mistake happen?'

Pensioner Elizabeth Abbott, who lives on the same street, added: 'Do we even really need a bypass? Whatever they do will not be enough.'

Chris Wood, county councillor for Fareham Crofton, said: 'I am terribly sorry this error has occurred and the needless anguish it has caused some of my residents.

'This is absolutely unacceptable, I am as angry as some of them are.

'I can assure villagers this was sent in error and no homes are to face compulsory purchase orders.

'The letters were meant to inform of ecological surveys, the company overstepped its remit and caused good people needless worry.'

Stubbington Borough councillor Jim Forrest described the incident as a 'breathtaking error.'

He
said: 'There is a lot of elderly residents in that area and they spent 
the weekend worried about what will happen to their homes.

Barry Gee and Elizabeth Abbott who both live on Burnthouse Lane (pictured) were baffled by the mistake, and questioned whether the area need a bypass in the first place

An estimated 150 residents received the letters on Friday morning. Hampshire County Council have since insisted no homes will be destroyed in the construction of the bypass

A Hampshire County Council spokesman said: 'We would like to apologise unreservedly for any distress caused by a letter that was sent out in error to around 150 householders in the Fareham area by consultants working on developing proposals for Stubbington Bypass.

'The County Council would like to reassure residents there are no plans to Compulsory Purchase any residential properties as part of work to develop options for a Stubbington bypass.

'The letter issued to householders, by consultants working with the Council, was intended for owners of land directly affected by the route options consulted on earlier this year, but was inadvertently sent to residents in the surrounding areas.'

After considering three proposed routes for the new bypass, the council has said it will investigate alternative options and carry out ecological research before making a decision.
