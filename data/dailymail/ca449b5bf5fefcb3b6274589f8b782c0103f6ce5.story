Police have launched an urgent appeal after a mother and her three young children have been missing for a week after vanishing from their home in Glasgow.

Kristina Pikse, 28, and her sons David, eight, and Danius, four, and their nine-month-old sister Zana Hauberts, were last seen in the Pollok area of the city last week.

It is thought the family were travelling to Blackburn in Lancashire but officers have been unable to trace the family since.

Miss Pikse is described as very slim with long, dark hair, brown eyes and sallow skin.

David is described as having dark hair, brown eyes and sallow skin and was wearing black jeans and a white polo shirt.

Danius is described as having dark hair with two lines shaved into the right side of his head, brown eyes and sallow skin and was wearing jeans and a brown/green jumper.

Zana is described as having dark hair, brown eyes and sallow skin and was wearing a white dress with a Minnie Mouse on it and a pink cardigan.

Police Scotland say they were last seen at 4.10pm on Tuesday, August 26 in Pollok.

A spokesman from the force said: 'It is believed that the family may have travelled to the Blackburn area, however despite extensive enquiries officers have been unable to trace Ms Pikse and her young family.

'Anyone who has seen them since Tuesday August 26 or knows of their present whereabouts is asked to contact Pollok police office on 101.'

David Hauberts, eight, and his four-year-old brother Danius, four, disappeared with their mother at about 4pm

Miss Pikse, who also appears to spell her name Kristine, is thought to originally be from Riga, in Latvia.

Her Facebook page shows dozens of pictures of herself, family and friends. Most focus on her children, with happy snaps of christenings, days out and holidays.

Last night, concerned readers from across the country left messages on the Daily Mail website.

SJ, from Yorkshire, said: 'Hope everything is well and there is a happy ending.'

Kate, from Newcastle, wrote: 'What beautiful looking children, I hope they turn up safe and well', while Claremorris, posting from Ireland, said simply: 'Please find them!'

Latest figures, from 2011-12, showed around 313,000 people were reported missing in the UK – about 280,000 in England and Wales and 33,000 in Scotland.

Officers are also trying to trace a 78-year-old woman who is missing from Aberdeen.

Mary Ryan was last seen at the Bus Station at Guild Street around 12.30pm on Monday.

She is 5ft 4in with long, white hair which is usually tied back. When last seen, she was wearing a floral dress, blue or green cardigan and furry boots.

She was carrying a shopping bag and may have been using a walking stick as an aid.

It is believed that she has boarded a bus and may be in the Aberdeenshire or Moray area, possibly Elgin.
