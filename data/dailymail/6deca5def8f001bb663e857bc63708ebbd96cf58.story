Boris Johnson has bowed to pressure from America and paid a US tax bill which he previously rejected as 'absolutely outrageous'.

The American-born London Mayor had been furious that he was being chased by the US taxman for an unpaid bill worth thousands of dollars.

But after being urged by the US ambassador to pay his dues, Mr Johnson has now settled his bill.

After being urged by the US ambassador to pay his dues, the London Mayor has now settled the demand from the IRS for profits made on the sale of a house.

Mr Johnson was born in New York and has an American passport as well as a British one.

The law means that American citizens must pay income tax to US authorities if they earn more than £62,000.

The can also be taxed on capital gains on selling a main house made anywhere in the world.

Rejecting the demands, Mr Johnson recently said: 'I think it's outrageous! No is the answer. Why should I?'

The demand came from the US Internal Revenue Service (IRS) in relation to the profit he made on the sale of a home in north London.

Last month Matthew Barzun, the US ambassador in London, defended the rules, insisting any US citizen had to pay the tax that is due. 

He added: 'Look, I mean we have our rules and we expect people to play by them.

'And if you get the benefits of being an American citizen you pay your fair share in taxes.'

Now it has emerged that Mr Johnson has settled the bill, said to be much less than the £100,000 rumoured last year.

A spokesman for Mr Johnson said: 'The Mayor won't be saying anything more on the subject. The matter has been dealt with.'

Mr Johnson has previously said he would like to renounce his US citizenship. 

The IRS rules state: 'If you are a US citizen or resident alien, the rules for filing income, estate, and gift tax returns and paying estimated tax are generally the same whether you are in the United States or abroad.

'Your worldwide income is subject to US income tax, regardless of where you reside.'

Mr Johnson used the row to demand the US Embassy in London to pay the congestion charge.

Latest figures suggest Mr Barzun's embassy owes more than £8million for driving officials and dignitaries around London.

But Mr Barzun has made clear he will continue to refuse to pay up, citing rules which allow embassies to avoid paying tax which would affect business operating in host countries.
