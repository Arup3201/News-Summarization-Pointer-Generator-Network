An asylum seeker arrived by boat on Australian shores dressed in the bright yellow uniform of an Aussie cricketer.

And when asked who he was, he told immigration officials: ‘I’m a fast bowler’.

The man's arrival on Christmas Island, where he was among about 60 asylum seekers who had to be rescued from their boat, caused great amusement among immigration officials.

Hit for six: Hardline immigration officials on Australia's Easter Island creased in amusement when an asylum seeker, centre, arrived on a boat in a full Australian one-day cricket uniform and said he was a fast bowler

But the fast bowler will soon hear 
the bad news that he will be transferred away from the Australian 
territory, despite his creative methods.

The man, whose nationality has yet to be revealed, donned the yellow one-day cricket uniform for his attempt to start a new life in Australia - perhaps as a cricketer.

It made him stand out among the other asylum seekers who were rescued by an Australian ship after their own vessel ran into trouble off the Indonesian island of Java late last week.

Australia had asked the Indonesian government to take them back to the capital, Jakarta, but the request was refused, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation reported.

It is thought the asylum seekers will instead be transferred to an island near Papua New Guinea or elsewhere in the Pacific.

Unusual though it sounds, the man, left, would not be the first asylum seeker to play internationally. Fawad Ahmed, right, fled to Australia from Pakistan in 2010 faced with extremists. He joined the team in August

Canberra has taken a hardline approach
to asylum seekers since Australia's Liberal Party seized control of the
government in September from Kevin Rudd’s Labour.

Christopher Pyne, leader of 
Government Business, vowed asylum seekers from Asia and South East Asia 
would never set foot in Australia.

‘The message is out there. Boats have been turned back,’ Mr Pyne told the Channel 10 TV network.

‘Sometimes it won’t work that way and those people who will come to Christmas Island (in Australian territory) will go straight to Manus Island (Papua New Guinea) or Nauru (in the Pacific) and they will never set foot in this country.
