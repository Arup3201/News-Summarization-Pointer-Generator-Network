While most of us throw them away without a second thought, one artist has found inspiration in the humble toilet roll, creating intricate miniature artworks inside the discarded cardboard tubes.

With scenes depicting a wheelchair basketball match, Wild West cowboys out on the range and even a fun-fair it is hard to believe that these silhouetted figures have actually been made out of the leftover insides of loo rolls.

Artist Anastassia Elias spends hours painstakingly cutting out tiny shapes to make detailed models inside the tubes, using the paper the same colour as the cardboard to created her mini-masterpieces.

The 37-year-old professional painter and illustrator by trade, uses manicure scissors and a scalpel to create the shapes which she then manipulates into position using tweezers.

So far Ms Elias has created more than 75 toilet roll designs, with her pieces made between 2009 and 2012 now on display in her new book 'Rouleaux'.

Ranging from Wild West cowboys to prehistoric jungles, the Parisian artist draws inspiration from anything she might come across in her everyday life.

'I have a lot of fun exploring what is possible with recuperated materials,' she said.

'My favourite reaction is when people find my rolls inspiring.

'I've always loved to draw and create things using different techniques.'
