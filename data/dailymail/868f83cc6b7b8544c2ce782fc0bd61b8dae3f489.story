Floyd Mayweather Jnr is known to fancy a flutter, but this time it's he who is the subject of a huge bet.

Rapper 50 Cent, who used to be part of The Money Team, plans to stake $1.6million (£1million) on Mayweather beating Pacquiao on May 2.

Should Mayweather prevail in Las Vegas, 50 Cent - real name Curtis Jackson - would pocket $2.3m (£1.5m).

'I got the champ,' he told The Breakfast Club. 'The champ gonna smoke him. It's gonna look like [the fight] was pumped up for no reason.'

50 Cent said he ran into Mayweather at a Chris Brown concert at the Barclays Centre in New York and that he was 'focused'.

It was only last year that the pair were engulfed in a bitter row when 50 Cent promised to donate $750,000 to charity if Mayweather could read a page of a Harry Potter book.

In response, the pound-for-pound No 1 tweeted pictures of his last two pay cheques, totally more than $70m, to remind 50 Cent how rich he was.

And he said: ‘'I'd be perfect at reading if it was how I had to feed my family.'

Mayweather’s relationship with 50 Cent were business partners until 2012 before they split with the latter forming his own promotional company.

Mayweather and Pacquiao both started their training camps on Monday, in Las Vegas and Los Angeles respectively.

They will face the media for the only time before fight week in downtown Los Angeles on March 11.
