The head of the Homeland Security Committee has demanded answers from the secret service chief as to just how many agents were involved in the prostitution scandal as it appeared more will lose their jobs.

Representative Peter King wanted the names of those Government employees embroiled in the incident.

The episode came to light when a 24-year-old 
high-end escort fought with an agent who slept with her at a Colombian 
hotel but then refused to hand over the $800 fee they had agreed upon.

Demands: Homeland Security Committee Chairman Representative Peter King has sent a list of questions to the head of the Secret Service over the prostitution scandal in Colombia

King has also demanded to know whether 
federal money was used and if agents had weapons or classified material 
in the rooms where they brought the women in Cartagena earlier this 
month.

He put a deadline on
director Mark Sullivan for the information within five days according to Fox news - and answers 
as to whether the scandal reaches as high up as the Executive Office of
 the President.

Six Secret Service agents have already been fired and it is thought that more will go after the scandal implicated up to 23 government employees.

The grilling came as Iowa's senior 
senator Chuck Grassley said that more 'heads have to roll' for the 
Secret Service to avoid 'mistakes'.

Six out of 11 employees were linked to a night of
 partying in the coastal city of Cartagena on April 11-12 and have left the 
agency over the scandal, which embarrassed the U.S. and 
overshadowed Obama's participation in the Summit of Americas meeting.

‘If the culture of an organisation is
 going to change or mistakes like this  are not going to be repeated, 
heads have to roll and that is why I think you are going to find more 
heads rolling,’ the senator said. 

Rep. King told Fox News: 'I would think you'll see most of the 11 either resign, retire or will be forced to leave.

'I doubt, no matter what happens, you're going to see any of these 11 ever involved in any kind of detail like this again.'

The Secret Service, which is tasked 
with protecting the president, senior administration officials and other
 prominent figures, said last week that a 12th employee had been 
implicated in the probe and another had been cleared of 'serious 
misconduct' in Cartagena but would face administrative action.

King, whose committee was probing the Cartagena incident, said the employee was involved in a separate incident that happened 'five or six days before the president arrived.'

The New York Republican said he had four investigators on the case and had spoken several times with Secret Service Director Mark Sullivan about the agency's own investigation.

'We want a full record (of the probe), so at the end we can decide if the Secret Service acted appropriately once they found out about it,' King said.

Two of the original 11 Secret Service employees involved in the scandal were supervisors, he added.

'They should have been in control of everything. Instead, they were accessories. They were part of it,' King said.

'Among those eleven, besides what they did, they also are in trouble, if you will, for what they didn't do. And what they didn't do is report it,' King said.

A former director of the Secret Service said the Colombian prostitution scandal was an extraordinary incident at the agency.

He told CBS today that while agents had been disciplined in the past - none had been taken out of service.

W. Ralph Basham, who ran the service between 2003 and 2006, said: 'I don’t believe in the past these types of things have happened. They certainly didn’t happen on my watch.'
