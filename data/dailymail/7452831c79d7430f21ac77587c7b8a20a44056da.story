England's experimental use of Manu Tuilagi on the wing may be short-lived after a match where he was unable to emulate the explosive impact he had from midfield seven days earlier.

Stuart Lancaster was asked after this defeat if the ploy would be repeated next week and said: ‘We’ve got to assess the game.

‘We won’t make any decisions until Wednesday next week. Overall, the back-line created opportunities as a group; the disappointment is that we weren’t able to finish them. But three tries in Dunedin is not a bad return.’

Tuilagi did make a telling contribution at the end of the match, when his back-hand off-load sent Mike Brown clear and paved the way for Chris Ashton’s try, but prior to that there had been ample proof that he is not a bona fide winger.

The most obvious example came just before half-time when Tuilagi broke clear on the right but lacked the pace to finish off the chance he created.

Time and again, the All Blacks sought to target him and, while the 23-year-old’s defensive resolve was not in question, every kick behind him equated to a flurry of panic in English ranks as he set about the unfamiliar routine of turning and tracking back under pressure.

Overall, there was just an over-riding sense that one of England’s primary attacking weapons had been somewhat marginalised, which suited New Zealand far more than the tourists.

Pros: Manu Tuilagi helped to set up a try, created a scoring opportunity for himself, made six tackles — three more than last week — and showed an increasing hunger to go looking for the ball as the game wore on.

Cons: He was less heavily involved — he had 10 runs, three fewer than in the first Test — and lacked conviction when the ball was kicked in his vicinity. He was also unable to take his scoring chance.
