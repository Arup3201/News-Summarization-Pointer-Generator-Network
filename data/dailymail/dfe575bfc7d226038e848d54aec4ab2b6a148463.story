A teenage neo-Nazi accused of plotting a ‘new Columbine’ told the Old Bailey he wanted to ‘get back’ at his classmates for bullying him.

The boy, now 17, said he wrote a ‘hit list’ in his diary of ‘potential targets’ for an attack he called his ‘operation’ on his former school in Loughborough, Leicestershire, last year.

‘It’s what was going through my head at the time and writing it made me feel better,’ he said.

Accused: Giving evidence at his terrorism trial the teenager, whose identity is hidden, told the Old Bailey that he wanted to 'get back' at his classmates for bullying him

‘But I didn’t have any intention of doing it.

‘By putting those things down it made me feel as if I had got my own back on people who were bullying me.’

The teenager, who can not be named for legal reasons, had lists of weaponry and bombs and admitted to the jury buying a machete, which he said ‘was for camping’.

‘The lists were for the intention of buying them, most of it was because I was interested in camping and survival,’ he said.

In his diaries he said he ‘had no 
choice but to use violence because it’s the only way people will listen 
to my opinion or ideology’.

He told the jury that he did ‘not entirely’ mean this.

‘I wasn’t writing it because I meant it,’ he said.

Name calling: The boy said that classmates called him 'a facist, racist and an English Anders Breivik', pictured

‘I suppose in a way I did mean it on the day but not entirely.

‘I
wasn’t intending to use any violence. I wrote it because I was upset 
about what people had been saying and that’s how I was feeling on that 
day.’

He also said he identified with the characters in a book called Spree Killers, about massacres in schools and colleges, and that the book affected him.

‘Some of the people in the book had been bullied or mistreated, I could relate to that because I’ve been bullied a lot and mistreat so there are similarities.

‘I think in a way it influenced some of the things I did, the things I wrote and even some of the clothes I wore.’

The schoolboy, who said he felt ‘intimidated’ when he walked past a mosque, was called a ‘Nazi, fascist, racist and an English Anders Breivik’ by his classmates.

He allegedly brought a lock-knife to college and showed it to other students during an induction day when he was 16.

The teenager also threatened to shoot one classmate in the head and stab another in the neck, the court heard.

He is accused of stockpiling weapon and explosives to carry out a Columbine-style massacre at his former school in Loughborough, last year.

The boy moved schools several times because he was bullied and spent more than a year out of school, the jury heard.

He said he was often unhappy and did not have anyone to talk to.

After school the teen would spend his time alone in his room and ate dinner alone.

He
was brought up by his mother and they were evicted from their home 
twice during his childhood and lived with different family members, 
including his older brother and their grandmother.

The
defendant denies possessing an article for a purpose connected with 
terrorism and possessing a document likely to be useful to a person 
committing or preparing an act of terrorism.

He
has admitted possessing an offensive weapon and possessing parts which 
could be used to make for improvised explosive, namely carbon dioxide 
canisters.

The trial continues.

Trial: The boy's trial is being heard at the Old Bailey in London. He denies possessing an article for a purpose connected with terrorism and possessing a document likely to be useful to a person committing or preparing an act of terrorism
