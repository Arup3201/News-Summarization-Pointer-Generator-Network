The trial of mass killer Anders Breivik ended with him declaring that his bombing and shooting rampage that killed 77 people was necessary to defend Norway from multiculturalism.

Relatives of his victims walked out as he claimed: ‘My brothers in the Norwegian and European resistance are sitting out there following this trial, while planning new attacks. They could be responsible for as many as 40,000 being killed.’

In his rambling closing statement yesterday, he also lashed out at everything he finds wrong with the world, from non-ethnic Norwegians representing the country in the Eurovision Song Contest to the sexually  liberated lifestyle of the characters in the American TV show Sex And The City.

Killer: Anders Behring Breivik has admitted the murders, so the only question to be asked is whether he is sane or not

Rant: Breivik rambled about Sex and the City, which stars (left to right) Cynthia Nixon, Sarah Jessica Parker, Kim Cattrall and Kristin Davis

Salute: Breivik gestured as he entered the courtroom, but was asked to stop doing it because he was offending his victims' families

The self-styled anti-Muslim militant 
also demanded to be set free on the final day of the 10-week 
proceedings, but it's unclear whether it helped the main point of his 
defence: trying to prove he is sane.

Final arguments revolved around the question of whether he is a lunatic or not with his defence lawyer stating in closing 
arguments that Breivik was sane and had the ‘basic human right’ to be 
punished for what he believed was a political act.

If the judges agree with the prosecution
that Breivik is insane, he will be destined for a mental institution 
instead of a prison.

While some of Breivik's comments prompted laughter in the Oslo court, a serious atmosphere returned when he reiterated his motive for bombing the Norwegian capital's government headquarters, killing eight, and hunting down teenagers at the Labor Party's youth camp. 

Sixty-nine people were dead and dozens more injured in one of the worst peacetime shooting massacres by a single gunman.

'History shows that you have to commit a small barbarism to prevent a bigger barbarism,' the 33-year-old Norwegian said.

'The attacks on July 22 were preventive attacks to defend the indigenous Norwegian people,' he said. 'I therefore demand to be acquitted.'

Breivik claims the governing Labor Party has betrayed the country by accepting Muslim immigrants and must be stopped before turning Norway into what he called a 'multiculturalist hell'.

Earlier today, defence lawyer Geir Lippestad had tried to prove his client is sane - the key issue to be resolved in the trial since Breivik admits the attacks.

The killer shouted 'I will kill you all' and 'you shall die' as he took down his victims on the island

Lippestad also formally entered a plea for acquittal, but it was made out of principle, without any realistic chance of success.

Also today, relatives of some of those killed tried to put their loss in words.

Kirsti Loevlie, whose 30-year-old daughter Hanne was killed by the bomb, moved the court room to tears when she described the shock of finding out her daughter was dead, the grief of cleaning out her room and the first Christmas without her.

Still, Loevlie said she felt a need to attend the trial, seeing Breivik in a position where he couldn't hurt anyone anymore.

'I am not going to be afraid of this man,' Loevlie said. 'I decided I would go to court. I felt I owed it to Hanne.'

The court room burst out in applause and audible sobs as she finished her statement. Breivik remained motionless, his face blank.

Lippestad tried to prove to the court that Breivik's claims of being a resistance fighter in a struggle to protect Norway and Europe from being colonised by Muslims are not delusional, but part of a political view shared by other right-wing extremist.

'He realised that it is wrong to kill but he chose to kill. That's what terrorists do,' Lippestad said.

'The ends justify the means. You don't understand this if you don't understand the culture of right-wing extremists.'

'When Breivik talks about a civil war he's not fantasizing about tanks and soldiers in the forest, but referring to a low-intensity struggle he believes will last for 60 years', Lippestad said.

'None of us know what Europe will look like in 60 years,' Lippestad said. 'Who would have thought 10 years ago that a right-wing extremist party in Greece would get 10 per cent in the election now?'

Two teams of psychiatrists reached opposite conclusions about Breivik's mental health. The first team diagnosed him with 'paranoid schizophrenia', a serious mental illness.

The second team found him legally sane, saying he suffers from a dissocial and narcissistic personality disorder, but is not psychotic. Prosecutors on Thursday called for an insanity ruling, saying there was enough doubt about Breivik's mental state to preclude a prison sentence.

The five-judge panel will announce its ruling on August 24, chief judge Wenche Elisabeth Arntzen said. If deemed mentally competent, Breivik would likely be given Norway's maximum prison term of 21 years.

A sentence can be extended beyond that if a prisoner is considered a menace to society.  If declared insane, he would be committed to a mental institution for as long as he's considered sick and dangerous to others.

Prosecutors suggested Thursday that could mean he would be held for the rest of his life.  Lippestad's otherwise focused statement ended on a confusing note when he asked the court for the most lenient possible prison sentence for his client.

After being corrected by Breivik, Lippestad said the defense asks for an acquittal or a lenient sentence, but primarily wants the court to reject the insanity claim.

The trial, which started on April 16 in a purpose-built courtroom, started with Breivik crying on the first day. It was the only time he showed any emotion during the trial and came as prosecutors showed a YouTube video he posted online before the attacks.

Breivik shot 69 people, most of them teenagers, at the ruling Labour Party's summer camp on Utoya Island, pictured with rescuers last July

It outlined his perception that Muslims are colonising Europe and that Christian Europeans will rise up in armed revolt.Breivik's defense lawyer Geir Lippestad said that he was moved by being reminded of his self-imposed mission to 'save Europe from an ongoing war'.

For the first two days Breivik greeted the court with his own version of a fascist salute, but stopped after his lawyers told him that the victims' families found it offensive.

On the penultimate day, after prosecutors asked for an insanity ruling that he rejected, the salute was back.Defiantly, Breivik thrust out his right arm with a clenched fist. This time he directed it straight at the prosecutors.

Survivors of his rampage gave harrowing accounts, but the most gruesome testimony was from the gunman himself. Sparing no detail, he took a shocked courtroom through his killing spree on Utoya, victim by victim, bullet by bullet. His voice never cracked. His facial expression remained blank.

Breivik's utter lack of emotion and empathy was seen by some psychiatrists as a symptom of a deep mental illness. He said he had prepared himself to keep his composure through meditation.

The only outburst of anger during the entire trial came when an Iraqi man, whose brother was killed on Utoyam took off his shoe and tossed it at Breivik on May 11, hitting one of his defence lawyers.

The hearing was briefly suspended as the man was led out of the court, crying. Besides that incident, the relatives of victims kept remarkably calm, saying they wanted to respect the judicial process.

Some said Breivik must not have any opportunity to claim he didn't get a fair trial when it's all over. The five-judge panel will announce its ruling on 
August 24.
