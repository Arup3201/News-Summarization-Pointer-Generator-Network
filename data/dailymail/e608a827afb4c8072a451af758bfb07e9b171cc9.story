Twitter's boss recently admitted the social network 'sucks' at dealing with trolls and now the site is making good on its promise to clamp down on these abusive accounts. 

Reports from The Verge claim the site will start banning users who violate its rules by tracking  email addresses and phone numbers.

This means that if an offender attempts to sign up for other accounts using these details Twitter will be able to intervene. 

Reports claim Twitter will start banning trolls and abusive users by tracking email addresses and phone numbers. When people sign up they are required to give an email address, but adding a  number (pictured) is optional. To solve this issue, Twitter may  ban accounts accused of abuse until they provide a phone number

When people sign up to Twitter they are required to provide an email address, which is then validated. 

Adding a phone number is an optional step and is predominantly used if people want to receive text notifications or setup two-step verification. 

Under the reported plans, once a user is banned these email addresses and phone numbers will be stored and cross-referenced each time a new user signs up to the site.

It is not known how this information will be stored and how specifically it will be used and MailOnline has contacted Twitter for more information. 

Stories of abuse, threats and internet trolls have become commonplace on Twitter in recent years. 

Robin Williams’ daughter, Zelda Williams, left the social platform last year after being sent disturbing images in the wake of her father’s suicide.

Feminist critic Anita Sarkeesian was threatened with rape, sexual violence and death by Twitter trolls during the 'Gamergate' saga after she criticised the way women are portrayed in video games.

In the UK, journalist Caroline Criado-Perez also received rape threats after she voiced her support for the campaign to introduce Jane Austen as the new face of the £10 note.

Twitter users Isabella Sorley and John Nimmo admitted sending the messages to Ms Criado-Perez and both were jailed last year. 

Although this is a positive step, the system is unlikely to catch trolls if they sign up for accounts with multiple email addresses. 

Similarly, as adding a phone number is optional, this won't always be possible to track. 

But The Verge continued  Twitter may temporarily ban accounts accused of abuse until they provide a phone number to get round this issue.

Earlier this month, an internal memo sent by Twitter's chief executive Dick Costolo revealed the 51-year-old thinks his site ‘sucks at dealing with abuse and trolls’.

In the memo, Mr Costolo said  he is embarrassed by the way the company handles abuse and that it must take stronger action in the future.

Mr Costolo’s comments were posted on an internal forum among Twitter employees, after one employee raised the question of what more could be done to tackle online abuse.

In December, a blog post titled 'Building a safer Twitter' revealed  Twitter is working on ways to make it easier to block and report abuse. 

The site has since improved the reporting process to make it more mobile-friendly, and it now requires less initial information.

These enhancements similarly improved the reporting process for people who see abuse but aren’t directly receiving it. More recently the site posted a follow-up blog updating users on its new safety features. MailOnline has contacted Twitter for more information about how users details will be stored

Under the Malicious Communications Act 1988, any 'indecent or grossly offensive' message that causes 'distress or anxiety' to the recipient can lead to prosecution.

The maximum punishment is a fine not exceeding level four on the standard scale - i.e. no more than £2,500.

Since the 1988 law came into force before the widespread use of the internet, e-mail and social networking, prosecutors have used a number of different laws to charge Twitter trolls.

Student Liam Stacey, who sent a series of racially abusive tweets after footballer Fabrice Muamba collapsed, was charged under the Crime and Disorder Act.

Two men jailed for inciting riots last summer were found guilty under the Serious Crime Act, and Paul Chambers, who joked he would blow Doncaster airport 'sky high' was charged under the Communications Act 2003.

It has also made it simpler to flag tweets and accounts for review.

More recently, the site posted a follow-up blog updating users on its new safety features. 

Tina Bhatnagar, Twitter's vice president of User Services said: 'Over the last six months, in addition to the product changes, we have overhauled how we review user reports about abuse. 

'Overall, we now review five times as many user reports as we did previously, and we have tripled the size of the support team focused on handling abuse reports.

'We are also beginning to add several new enforcement actions for use against accounts that violate our rules. 

These new actions will not be visible to the vast majority of rule-abiding Twitter users - but they give us new options for acting against the accounts that don’t follow the rules and serve to discourage behavior that goes against our policies.

The safety of our users is extremely important to us. It’s something we continue to work hard to improve.' 

In recent years Twitter has come under fire for failing to protect its users from trolls. Robin Williams’ daughter, Zelda Williams, left the social platform last year after being sent disturbing images in the wake of her father’s death. She made an appeal to her  followers to report two users on Twitter (shown above)
