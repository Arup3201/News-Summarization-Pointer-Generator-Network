Legacy: Richard Greener was Harvard University's first African-American

A house clearance worker who discovered the papers of Harvard’s first African-American graduate is threatening to burn them unless the university or a collector buys them from him for the 'right price'.

Rufus McDonald, 52, found the papers belonging to Richard T. Greener while clearing out a house in Englewood, Chicago, earlier this year.

His discovery was hailed as remarkable, as it was feared the records had been destroyed by racist groups or lost in the 1906 San Francisco earthquake.

The papers include Mr Greener's 1870 Harvard diploma and his law license as well as photos and papers connected to his diplomatic role in Russia and his friendship with President Ulysses S. Grant.

Mr McDonald sold just two of the documents for $52,000 to the University of South Carolina, where Mr Greener also studied and taught.

But he was so incensed by Harvard's offer that he is now threatening to destroy the 140-year-old papers.

'I’ll roast and burn them,' said Mr McDonald who claims Harvard offered him an 'insulting' $7,500 for the collection that was appraised at $65,000.

'It might sound crazy, but people who know me know I’d really do it — I’m sick and tired,' he told the Chicago Sun Times.

A Harvard spokesman declined to comment on the ultimatum, but a university source familiar with the negotiation told the newspaper it offered Mr McDonald 'significantly more' than $7,500.

According to a bio from the University of South Carolina, where he served as the first African-American professor, Mr Greener was born on January 30, 1844, in Philadelphia and was raised from the age of ten in Boston.

He attended the Broadway Grammar School in Cambridge, Massachusetts until he was fourteen, then dropped out of school to help support his family, working as a porter, clerk and night-watchman in an assortment of jobs.

With help from two of his employers Mr Greener attended school and they arranged for his admission to Harvard in 1865 as an experiment in the education of African-Americans.

In 1870 Mr Greener graduated from Harvard with honors, the first African-American to do so.

But Mr Greener was not the first black person to be admitted - that title belongs Beverly Garnett Williams, who died just before the academic year began in 1847.

After his graduation Mr Greener spent a few years teaching in schools before becoming a professor at the University of South Carolina in October of 1873.

In the years that followed he took a post as a professor in the Howard Law School and married in 1874, having six children with his wife Genevieve Ida Fleet.

One of his daughters Belle went on to become a famous librarian to J. P. Morgan in New York.

Her skin was light - both Mr Greener and his wife had mixed heritages - so she pretended she was from a white background and added 'da Costa' to her name to give the impression of Portuguese ancestry, as well as changing Greener to Greene.

Mr Greener separated from his wife and left the country in 1898 to assume a consular post in Vladivostok, Russia, until 1905.

He left the foreign service in 1905, settling in Chicago with relatives, and held a job as an agent for an insurance company and practiced law.

Mr Greener occasionally lectured until he died of old age in Chicago on May 2, 1922.

The Chicago Sun reports that it is still unclear how the papers ended up in the house that was being cleared to be demolished as Mr Greener did not live near there.
