A culture of cheating to meet exam targets extends beyond English GCSE to other key subjects, watchdogs have found.

A series of testimonies from teachers reveals they have ‘fiddled’ exam grades, ‘nannied’ pupils through coursework and ‘cheated because other schools are doing so’.

Exams watchdog Ofqual disclosed that the claims were not ‘limited to English’ and called for a full-scale review of exam targets and league tables.

Helping hand: According to the inquiry, grade thresholds were actually toughened to combat over-marking by teachers

The anonymous confessions from 
teachers were contained in a report by Ofqual on the chaos surrounding 
the grading of English GCSE this year.

Figures published yesterday showed the full scale of the fiasco for the first time.

Nearly a quarter of schools and 
colleges – more than 600 – saw their English results nosedive at least 
10 per cent on the previous year. Almost 1,000 suffered at least a 5 per
cent fall.

Ofqual has found that the debacle was 
triggered by ‘significant over-marking’ of assignments by teachers who 
were under ‘intense pressure’ to achieve grade Cs for their pupils.

English GCSEs were also poorly 
designed in the first place, with 60 per cent of the marks resting on 
‘controlled assessments’ – coursework written under exam conditions but 
marked by teachers.

As teachers’ leaders lambasted claims 
of cheating, anonymous reports quoted by Ofqual showed that staff felt 
‘unhealthy pressures’ to inflate grades in ‘woolly’ assessments.

One admitted that grades in controlled
assignments were ‘fiddled’ to make up for poor marks in written exams. 
Another said pupils’ work was effectively rewritten by teachers.

The testimonies emerged  following 
interviews with more than 100 schools and postings on the Times 
Education Supplement web forum for teachers.

Glenys Stacey, chief executive of Ofqual, said: ‘Those postings aren’t limited to English.’

She added that there were ‘special pressures’ on English and that ‘other GCSEs are in the main stronger’.

But she believed that evidence of 
teaching and marking to target specific grades – mainly Cs – was closely
linked to the importance of a given subject in school performance 
tables.

Schools are mainly judged on results in English and maths, with 
science, languages, history and geography also carrying weight.

‘If we had the resource to map this 
out for all 70 subjects, I suspect that the patterns would directly 
relate to the place of qualifications in the accountability regime, 
subject by subject,’ she said. ‘I’m not expecting to see those patterns 
in drama.’

Ofqual denies results were ‘fixed’ but claims ‘tactical’ over- marking by some schools led to the grade boundary changes.

A TES survey found that 93 per cent of teachers had lost confidence in Ofqual.

Russell Hobby, of the National 
Association of Head Teachers, said teachers were ‘not to blame for the 
grading shambles surrounding the exam and they should not be made 
scapegoats for the system’.
