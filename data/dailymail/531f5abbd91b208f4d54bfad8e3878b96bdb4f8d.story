A series of forgotten images has shown America's oldest public hospital as it cares for the sick and the wounded in the mid-20th century through a range of once innovative techniques.

The pictures were taken at Bellevue Hospital, located on First Avenue in Manhattan, New York. It was founded on March 31, 1736 and trained some of America's finest doctors and medical pioneers. The hospital opened the country's first nursing school based on Florence Nightingale's principles in 1873.

In one image a young boy with polio adjusts his leg braces while sitting in a wheelchair. The polio virus struck fear into the American psyche, crippling thousands of people, mainly young children, as an epidemic raged in the early 20th century.

Standard procedure: An elderly man is strapped in and rotated in a large circular contraption at the New York hospital

Spin cycle: A student nurse massages the old man's knee as his therapy session sees him being rotated through 360 degrees until he is upright

Treatments included months spent in 
quarantines and rehabilitation units in hospital, using iron lung 
breathing machines. Polio cases peaked in the United States in 1952 
until a vaccine was introduced several years later.

In another image from Bellevue, an elderly gentleman is strapped to a large circular contraption. Medical staff then rotate him to heal his ailment which appears to be related to his knee joints which a student nurse massages.

One patient Helen Feldman is snapped carrying out gait coordination training. The physical therapy was often advised for patients who had suffered a stroke or benign tumour.Â 

Three men were captured deep in conversation at meal time in a Bellevue ward. One man in a wheelchair appears to be an amputee. Bellevue was well-known for its excellent rehabilitation clinic which often cared for wounded veterans following the Second World War.

Among Bellevue's many achievements, it carried out the first successful operation of the abdomen for a gun shot wound in 1894 and its doctors were the first to report that tuberculosis was a treatable disease.

According to its traditional mission, Bellevue is open to any one in need of care, of all backgrounds, irrespective of ability to pay to this day.
