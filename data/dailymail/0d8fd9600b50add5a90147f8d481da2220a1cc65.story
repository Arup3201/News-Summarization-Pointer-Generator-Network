Most children have comic book characters as their heroes but for five-year-old Kya Hoad, his hero is his big brother Calyn, 8.

Calyn saved Kya's life when the eight-year-old pushed his brother out of the way of a four-wheel-drive travelling at 60km/h on August 30, 2013 in Springwood, south of Brisbane.

The big brother got caught underneath the vehicle and sustained serious head injuries, which almost ended his life.

Mum Shanalee Hoad told Daily Mail Australia 'the 4WD literally cut [Calyn's] skull in half all the way around'. She said it was a miracle he survived

Mum Shanalee Hoad, 34, was taking her five-year-old daughter, Ashanti, to the bathroom after her dance class when Kya ran off.

Quick-thinking Calyn ran after him before Ms Hoad heard the screeching of brakes as she came out.

'The parents around me saw me going into shock and they wouldn’t let me get up to [the accident],' Ms Hoad told Daily Mail Australia.

'Kya was standing on the side of the road just yelling out "Calyn". Calyn had gotten under the 4WD.

'I can’t believe he was still alive and still breathing. We waited for the ambulance... [medical staff] induced him into a coma and put ice on his brain to reduce the swelling.

'The 4WD literally cut [Calyn's] skull in half all the way around. For someone to survive that was a miracle in itself.' 

The 4WD had severed Calyn's head, and caused such severe brain injuries that doctors warned Ms Hoad that he might never walk or talk again.

In order to ensure that the swelling on his brain didn't spread, surgeons had to remove part of his skull. 

'We were told a couple of times that we had to say goodbye to Calyn. Somehow he managed to pull through all of that,' said Ms Hoad.

'We were told the odds for him to walk and talk were very slim.' 

Calyn spend nearly three weeks in a coma at Brisbane's Royal Children's Hospital, where Ms Hoad and her husband, Benjamin, spent every day. 

When Kya went to visit his brother in hospital Ms Hoad said her five-year-old called Calyn his 'hero'.

Ms Hoad said doctors were told 'a couple of times' their son may not survive his injuries

'He would look up at me and my husband and say: "Calyn's my superhero",' Ms Hoad said.

The eight-year-old eventually came home on Australia Day last year, and has been battling to recover movement in his legs.  

Calyn has defied the odds and is now walking again, but his parents are hoping he will be able to talk again.

'He still uses his wheelchair but he's enjoying walking, especially when we were told he would never walk again,' Ms Hoad said. 

Due to the accident, Calyn has at least three fits a day and sometimes his siblings have to catch him before he falls to the ground and potentially hit his head again, which could cause further brain damage.

And now instead of his big brother looking out for him, Kya is looking out for Calyn.

Ms Hoad said siblings Kya and Ashanti - pictured here with Calyn - all love and support each other

'When Kya first came into the world, Calyn's always been a caring brother. He would get Kya get dressed in the morning,' Ms Hoad said. 

'But now since the accident, the tables have turned. Calyn needs a bit more help, so Kya gives him a hand.

'Sometimes Calyn goes out the front door and it's dangerous for him, so Kya grabs his hand and walks him away from the door.

'[Kya] grabs shoes and shirts in the morning to help get [Calyn] dressed and sometimes helps spoon-feed him, and Kya’s always smothers him in kisses and cuddles.'  

Out of tragedy came extraordinary kindness from strangers who helped the Hoads remodel their home in April 2014 so it was more comfortable for Calyn to live in with his wheelchair, hoist, shower chair and special bed so the family 'don’t have to turn him around every couple hours at night'.

'It's the most beautiful thing to be part of. The human spirit and kindness is so overwhelming amazing. It makes you feel so blessed. 

In 2014, Calyn was awarded the Spirit of Australia Child of Courage medal for his selfless act of bravery.

'If not [for the community support], we would be living in our in-laws house. It's great to be home and be a family again.' 

To help the family out with medical bills, Ms Hoad's sister-in-law, Rebecca, set up a fundraising page.

They are hoping to raise money for Calyn to see a speech therapist and get an epilepsy-detecting dog. 

Ms Hoad said that Calyn is still Kya's hero, and that she was touched by the way her children loved each other. 

'We are definitely really proud of Calyn. The children always look out for each other,' she said.

'I think that's really important in our family and we're definitely, definitely proud of our Calyn. It's been a journey so far.'
