Dropped: Peter Rippon shelved Newsnight's investigation into paedophile Jimmy Savile and it was alleged today he refused to reopn it because he was furious when his decision was leaked

Peter Rippon, the man who shelved the Newsnight investigation into decades of sexual abuse by Jimmy Savile, refused to reopen it because he was apoplectic his decision had been leaked, BBC sources have said.

His call last December sparked the greatest crisis the corporation has faced for 50 years, and he was accused of orchestrating a cover-up just because they had spent huge sums on tributes to the paedophile who died last year.

The BBC has since been dragged through the mud and forced to set up an inquiry into why exactly Newsnight's investigation was stopped.

Mr Rippon has said that the investigation was cancelled because the Crown Prosecution Service did not charge Savile, and he has always denied there was any cover-up.

Savile, who died last year at the age of 84, is being described as one of the most prolific sex offenders in UK history. He is thought to have abused at least 300 victims over four decades, and police are following more than 400 leads.

A friend of Mr Rippon told The Times: 'Peter said he always intended to pursue it (Savile's abuse). He then got so angry over the leaks. He spent most of Christmas dealing with that.

Another added: 'He felt the leak was being used to attack the BBC and that influenced his decision not to resume the investigation.'

It took a ITV documentary to reveal that Savile had raped and abused hundreds of children.

It then emerged that Newsnight had carried out its own investigation into the paedophile DJ - including an interview with the same victim in the ITV documentary - nearly a year before.

A BBC team spent six weeks probing allegations that the presenter abused pupils at a school in Surrey, speaking to at least four women who claimed they had been assaulted or knew about events.

But the report was shelved at the last minute at the request of Mr Rippon. It was not until last month that the BBC aired its own investigation into the scandal, on Panorama.

It covered both Savile's crimes and the Corporation's reaction. Mr Rippon stood aside from his role at Newsnight after the BBC said his explanation for shelving the story was 'inaccurate or incomplete'.

The corporation's director general George Entwistle was hauled before a select committee last month to explain why and how it happened.

He denied that the broadcaster helped cover up allegations that Savile preyed on women.

Yesterday police arrested Freddie Starr and released him on bail after being questioned by detectives investigating claims he molested a schoolgirl in Jimmy Savile's BBC dressing room.

He denies claims by Karin Ward that he tried to grope her in 1974 when she was a 14-year-old schoolgirl.

He is the second celebrity to be arrested after Gary Glitter, 68, was questioned for ten hours on Sunday on suspicion of committing sexual offences.

Detectives warned Savile’s living accomplices last week that ‘we are coming for you’, and have drawn up a detailed list of people they plan to arrest.

Last night Newsnight sensationally claimed that a 'leading politician from the Thatcher years' was embroiled in a widespread paedophile ring - and repeatedly raped boys from a children's home.

Alleged victim Steven Messham told reporters he was raped 'more than a dozen times' by the man, described on the programme as a 'shadowy figure of high public standing'.

But despite a string of damning allegations, Newsnight reporters said it didn't have 'enough evidence' to name the politician, sparking angry claims on Twitter that the Beeb 'bottled it'.
