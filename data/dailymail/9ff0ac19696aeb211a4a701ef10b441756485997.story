A nine-year-old girl whose tragic battle with Huntington's disease captured the nation’s sympathy after she was taunted about her suffering on Facebook by a neighbour died last night.

Kathleen Edward, of Wyandotte, Michigan, is expected to be buried at a memorial garden in nearby town Livonia next to her late mother Laura Edward, 24, who also died of the brain disorder, in 2009.

The girl hit the headlines 15 months ago when Jennifer Petkov, a neighbour of her grandmother Rebecca Rose, posted nasty images on Facebook that made fun of both Kathleen and Mrs Edward.

‘She suffered with this disease for a while and she never complained,’ Ms Rose told the Detroit Free Press. ‘She was also happy, always smiling. I didn’t want her to suffer anymore.’

Michigan Memorial Funeral Home in Flat Rock is organising the funeral and Kathleen, who died at 10pm on Wednesday, will be buried next to her late mother at Mount Hope Memorial Gardens.

Mrs Petkov, a former neighbour of Ms Rose in Trenton, became a figure of hatred after admitting to have taunted the girl. One Facebook posting was of the girl's photo placed over a set of crossbones.

Another included a photo of Mrs Edward in the arms of the grim reaper. Global backers who heard about the terrible abuse in October 2010 raised money to send Kathleen on a toy shopping spree.

A feud between Mrs Petkov and Ms Rose reportedly started in 2008 after a simple disagreement over an unanswered text message when the grandmother was holding a birthday party at her home.

Ms Rose has been inundated with messages of condolence on Facebook following Kathleen's death. ‘I can’t tell everybody how much I appreciate all of the kind words,’ she told the Detroit Free Press.

Kathleen is survived by her father Robert, stepmother and her two sisters - Ashley, 6, and Madison, 2. Huntington's disease also claimed the life of her grandfather, reported Fox affiliate WJBK.

Mrs Petkov apologised for what she did but faced charges of assault with a dangerous weapon and reckless driving after allegedly trying to run over another neighbour with her car, reported WKBK.

She was sentenced to 18 months of probation for assault and battery, reported Trenton Patch.

Ms Rose told Trenton Patch last June that she was being subjected to a fresh wave of online abuse against her own daughter - Kathleen’s aunt - who was being called a ‘retard’ outside her home.

Mrs Petkov became known as the 'Devil of Detroit Street' and was forced to move home last February after her and her husband Scott attracted international condemnation for what happened.

Last June Ms Rose gave police documents showing more nasty posts allegedly made by the Petkovs. One said: 'Detroit St. Party, When that kid dies, cause boys and girls it’s to happen (sic).'

Another post said: 'Dead and gone, only a few more hours till party time, I’m going to visit a grave and take a p***.' One post came a day before the anniversary of the death of Mrs Edward.

Police said Ms Rose was 'crying and extremely upset' by those messages in June. She served Personal Protection Orders against the Petkov couple, so they could not communicate with her.

The huge feud is thought to have begun over an unanswered text message relating to a party.

Ms Rose is understood to have received a text message when she was holding a bouncy castle birthday party from Mrs Petkov, who asked if her children could come over.

But because she did not respond to the text message fast enough, the feud is said to have begun.

When Mrs Edward died in 2009 the Petkov couple allegedly drove a pick-up truck up and down the street, adorned with a coffin and carrying the slogan 'Death Machine'.
