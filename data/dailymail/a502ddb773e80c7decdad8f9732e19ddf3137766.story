Spectators watched in horror at Cheltenham yesterday after a horse crashed through a rail and into a television camera, sending the jockey flying onto the concrete floor in a day of chaos.

Rider Daryl Jacob was admitted to hospital with a broken leg, knee and elbow after being thrown to the ground as horse Port Melon appeared to be spooked at the start of the race.

Dramatic television footage showed the cameraman and spectators in the nearby packed enclosure run away from the oncoming horse to avoid injury.

The Gold Cup, the main race on the final day of the four-day festival, was delayed by 15 minutes after Port Melon went through the rail before the start of the earlier Albert Bartlett Novice Hurdle.

Mr Jacob, who had won on Lac Fontana in the preceding County Hurdle, was stretchered off the course and taken to hospital for X-rays in Cheltenham.

Onlooker Charlie Harris, 37, said: ‘As the horses came onto the course at a canter, Port Melon veered off to the right and crashed through the white barrier towards the Best Mate enclosure - straight for the crowd.

‘There was a huge gasp as the jockey was thrown off, fell to the ground and was crushed underneath his horse.

'He
 didn’t get up and looked seriously injured. Within minutes, police and 
paramedics rushed to his side. Everyone was just praying he’d make a 
full recovery.

‘It was just horrendous - the guy is obviously seriously hurt. Five paramedics loaded him into ambulance.

‘The
 horse only deviated 10 yards but if he hadn’t fallen - he either tried 
to vault the barrier or just crashed into it - he would have ploughed 
straight into the spectators of Best Mate enclosure. They were moments 
from disaster - it was truly terrifying.’

Gary Carter, 41, who was near the front of the Best Mate enclosure, said: ‘Suddenly this horse came crashing towards us - it knocked over a TV camera and came straight for us.

The third race of the day was delayed by 15 minutes after the incident

‘It was pretty scary stuff. I thought it was going to trample us all - and everyone started running out the way. But fortunately the crash barrier brought it down just in the nick of time.’

Footage from the TV camera, which Port Melon crashed into, showed the horse charging towards it seconds before impact.

Port Melon's trainer Paul Nicholls 
later told Racing UK: 'It's not great news, I'm afraid. It's been 
confirmed at the hospital he's broken his knee, his leg and his elbow.

'He's
 going to be operated on tomorrow morning. It's devastating for him and 
is going to put him out for a while. I've seen the video of the incident
 and it's horrific.

'Obviously, he's desperately disappointed, but I'm glad he rode that winner on Lac Fontana or else he'd have been suicidal.

'He's ridden a winner, he's in good spirits, but it's terrible news having an injury like that.'

One person posted a still image of the footage with the caption, ‘Port Melon only wanted a #chelfie,’ a reference to the trend to post selfies at the Festival.

The accident came before one of the 
greatest shocks in Gold Cup history saw 20-1 Lord Windermere come from 
last to snatch victory by a nose, in a race that involved two false 
starts and a stewards’ enquiry.

On a day beset with drama, star jockey Ruby Walsh - the all-time leading rider at the Festival - suffered a fractured right arm after a heavy fall in the opening race forcing him to withdraw from the Gold Cup.

Jacob's fellow jockey Ruby Walsh was also taken to hospital and faces a lengthy spell out of action with a broken arm after coming off Abbyssial in the first race of the day.

The
 rider was diagnosed with a compound fracture of his right humerus, the 
bone in the upper arm.

Walsh was leading the field over the 
second hurdle when taking a crunching spill, bringing down stablemate 
Adriana Des Mottes in the process.

Walsh was able to walk gingerly to the ambulance, but could be seen holding his arm.

The rider was set to undergo surgery on the open fracture at Gloucester Hospital.

A racecourse spokesperson said: 'He has a compound fracture of his right humerus. He has been taken to Gloucester for surgery.'
