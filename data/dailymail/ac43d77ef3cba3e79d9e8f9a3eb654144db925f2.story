A man has filmed himself drinking three live goldfish in the latest shocking twist in the 'NekNominate' drinking craze.

The yob - believed to be from Derby - drank the fish from a pint glass containing a disgusting concoction of cider, raw eggs, engine oil and his own urine.

The RSPCA has spoken out against the 'horrible craze' after receiving numerous reports of people drinking live fish and posting the footage online.

NekNominate is a new trend which sees web users filming themselves drinking large amounts of alcohol and performing other outlandish stunts.

It came under fire this week after two young men died in Ireland while participating in the craze.

In the video of the man downing the goldfish, he can be seen smiling at the camera dressed in just a satin thong and a bow tie.

Viewers praised the stunt, egging on the man in his quest to be deliberately outrageous.

One wrote: 'Smashed it, knew you would come good, the fishes are your secret weapon.'

Foul: The man urinated into the glass before putting three live goldfish in too

Another said, 'That should go viral, hats off mate, that's class,' while a third added: 'That's by far the sickest I've seen. Gagged watching it.'

The RSPCA is investigating more than a dozen reports of animal cruelty from people who have watched video footage of goldfish being drunk by NekNominate participants.

'We are extremely concerned about this shocking new trend,' said wildlife scientist Nicola White. 'We have had quite a few similar cases reported to us in a very short space of time - but this could be just the tip of the iceberg as there's probably many more we have not been told about.

'Eating a live animal and posting of a film of it on the internet is not some light-hearted joke - it is unacceptable. It sends out a clear message that animal cruelty is OK as long as it is in the guise of entertainment.

'We urge people not to take part in this horrible craze and to report to us anyone who is taking part.'

Praise: Other web users spoke in support of the man's antics, with one saying 'hats off'

The NekNominate craze is thought to have originated in Perth, Australia, but thanks to social media it has since gone global.

The hashtag 'neknominate' started trending in the UK in January 2013 and has since been growing in popularity around the world.

The
concept of the game has been described by a user on Facebook as: 'Neck 
your drink. Nominate another. Don't break the chain, don't be a d**k. 
The social drinking game for social media! #neknominate. Drink 
Responsible'.

The stunt is filmed then posted on the internet.

One
popular video shows a bare-chested man emptying a bottle of beer down 
the toilet before two friends lower him head-first into the porcelain 
bowl to lap it up.

Superintendent Gary Parkin of Derbyshire Police said: 'Drinking large amounts of alcohol in a short space of time can have very serious consequences.

'Social media is used for many different things, both good and bad, and clearly this is at the wrong end of the scale. Challenging each other to drink more and more, often different and stronger alcoholic drinks, will cause harm and damage.

'It is obvious from recent stories and incidents that people have lost control trying to better people they know either as friends or through social media and have ended up in A&E or, more tragically, have died.

'I would urge people to act with responsibility when drinking alcohol and avoid putting themselves in unnecessary danger.'

Other NekNominate-related incidents to hit the headlines include a woman apparently riding into Tesco on a horse before downing a fizzy drink.

However, some people have attempted to turn the trend on its head by using it to spread positive behaviour such as donating blood, rather than binge drinking.Â
