A drunk bridegroom shoved a hotel porter through a glass door in a fit of rage when he discovered the bar was closing at his wedding reception.

Richard Airey, 36, pushed night porter James Heseltine through a glass door at the Mercure Hotel in Bingley, West Yorkshire, after trouble flared at his wedding reception on August 9.

The company director, from Leeds, attacked Mr Heseltine after he and another guest got into a row with the hotel porter about the fact the bar was closing at 1am.

Prosecutor Suzanne Paige told Bradford and Keighley Magistrates' Court how Mr Heseltine had been working as a night porter and security guard at the hotel when the two men reacted over plans to shut the bar.

Airey, who runs his own textiles business, pushed Mr Heseltine through a glass door causing him cuts to his back just hours after marrying his fiancée Leila.

Miss Paige said Mr Heseltine did not need hospital treatment for his injuries but Airey pleaded guilty to common assault when he appeared in court today.

His solicitor advocate, Laiquat Din, said the defendant had written to the hotel to apologise and had offered to pay for the damage to the door.

'It was his wedding day and not a very nice way to end his wedding night,' Mr Din told the court.

After being arrested, Airey told police he was sorry and admitted the offence at the first opportunity.

Airey admitted assaulting Mr Heseltine at the Mercure Hotel in Bingley, West Yorkshire (above), after a row erupted over the closure of a bar at the wedding reception. He was ordered to pay more than £300 by a court

The court heard how Airey realised his behaviour was unacceptable and now wanted to give up drinking alcohol.

District Judge Susan Bouch sentenced him to a 12-month community order, with supervision and a six month alcohol treatment requirement.

He was fined £50 and ordered to pay £85 prosecution costs and £200 compensation to Mr Heseltine.

The judge said the offence was aggravated by the fact that Mr Heseltine was working at the hotel as a security guard.
