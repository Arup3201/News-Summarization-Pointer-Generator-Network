Millionairess Carole Waugh was stabbed to death on the same day she last spoke to her family, a court heard today.

Ms Waugh, 50, suffered a fatal single stab wound in April but her body was only found four months later in a lock-up garage in south west London, magistrates were told. Her body was so badly decomposed she could only be identified by her dental records.

Magistrates heard how Miss Waugh was last seen in mid-April when she spent the weekend
with her family back in Durham. She last spoke to them on April 16th on
her arrival home in London and just hours later was stabbed, according to prosecutors.

Rakesh Bhayani, 
40, and Nicholas Kutner, 47, appeared at Croydon Magistrates Court today
charged with Ms Waugh’s murder.

The pair, who appeared via videolink from Wandsworth Prison in south London, sat apparently emotionless during the five minute hearing as they were told they were charged with the murder of the businesswoman between April 15th and 19th this year.

Bhayani and Kutner have already been charged with fraud offences linked to her disappearance, and Kutner allegedly pretended to be her brother so he could sell her flat.

Miss Waugh, originally from Durham but
who was living in Marylebone, central London, when she was last heard 
from, had not been seen for almost four months when her body was 
discovered in the boot of a VW Golf car in a garage in New Malden.

Marsha
Elias, prosecuting, told Croydon Magistrates Court: 'It is alleged that
between the evening of April 16 and the 17th the victim of our case 
Carole Waugh received a single stab wound. She was later discovered by 
police on August 2nd.'

Miss Waugh, who had worked in the oil industry in Libya, was reported missing on May 7 and police launched an investigation after finding her bank accounts had been plundered of hundreds of thousands of pounds. Personal possessions, including Cartier jewellery, are still missing.

Her body was discovered on August 2 in the boot of a VW Golf at a garage in Lime Court, New Malden, a day after Kutner was arrested at Luton Airport as he returned from a holiday in Majorca.

Officers have been probing whether Ms Waugh had led a double life as an escort with men she had met through a variety of dating sites whilst pretending to be a successful businesswoman.

Ms Waugh worked for eight years as a secretary for an oil company in Libya and claimed to own a flat behind Harrods and had a top-of-the-range Harley Davidson motorbike, despite her modest £25,000 salary.

Kutner, of no fixed abode, is also charged with four counts of conspiracy to commit fraud. He is accused of pretending to be Chris Waugh, Ms Waugh’s brother, in a bid to sell her £650,000 two bedroom flat in Marylebone, central London.

He also faces two charges relating to trying to renting her property at Tressard Court to two separate people - for which he was handed £10,000 - and a fourth of unlawfully withdrawing funds from the 50-year-old’s bank account.

Unemployed Bhayani, of Wembley, north west London, has already appeared in court on three charges of conspiracy to commit fraud by false representation relating to transactions associated with Ms Waugh’s identity worth around £280,000.

So far 11 people have been arrested in connection with the case and it is believed that at least three women have attempted to pose as her.

District Judge Tan Ikram said: 'I will send this case to the Central Criminal Court, the matter will be listed for an initial bail application on August 20th.'

They are expected to enter pleas in November.
