A prosecutor demanded severe punishment for disgraced politician Bo Xilai because of his lack of remorse as the court ended a five-day corruption trial Monday that offered glimpses into the shady inner workings of China's elite.

The trial, aimed at cementing Bo's political downfall and wrapping up the scandal set off by his wife's murder of a British businessman, painted a colorful picture of how Bo's alleged misconduct enriched his family.

Prosecutors said the proceedings have shown adequate proof of Bo's guilt on charges of netting £2.7million through bribes and embezzlement and abuse of power in interfering with the murder investigation.

'The defendant's crimes are extremely grave, and he also refuses to admit guilt. As such, the circumstances do not call for a lenient punishment but a severe one, in accordance with the law,' the prosecutor said, according to a transcript of court proceedings.

Bo is accused of providing political favors to a businessman, Xu Ming, in return for having him at his family's beck and call.

According to Bo's wife, Xu gave the family expensive gifts that included a villa in France and international airfare to three continents. Bo also is accused of funneling £510,000 in government funds from a secret project.

The charges of bribery and embezzlement carry penalties of between 10 years and life imprisonment, or death in severe cases, while the abuse of power charge could result in up to seven years' imprisonment.

Denial: Chinese politician Bo Xilai denied bribery when he appeared in court

Bo denied the charges against him and assailed the prosecution's key witnesses - his former right-hand man and his wife.

Throughout, Bo blamed his wife and others for netting the illicit money and assets, including a villa in France and funds from a secret government project, but largely denied knowledge of the misconduct.

Courts in China are controlled by the Communist Party so a conviction is expected, but Bo has mounted an unexpectedly spirited defence.

It has been said that the ruling 
Communist Party is using the trial against Bo, a former Politburo member
and party leader of the city of Chongqing, to cap a messy political 
scandal after his wife was convicted for the murder of British 
businessman Neil Heywood in August 2012.

Courtroom revelations by 
the prosecution have laid bare the way shady ties between powerful 
officials and businessmen can play out in China.

China's newly 
installed leadership is hoping to move on from the scandal to cement its
authority and fully focus on tackling serious economic and social 
challenges.

Bo's downfall also has been widely perceived as the result 
of his defeat in party infighting ahead of last fall's once-a-decade 
leadership transition.
