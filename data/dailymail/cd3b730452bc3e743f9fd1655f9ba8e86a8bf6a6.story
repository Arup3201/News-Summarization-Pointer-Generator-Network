Police who investigated the disappearance of Casey Anthony's two-year-old daughter admitted today that they overlooked a Google search for 'fool-proof' suffocation on the day the girl was last seen alive.

Captain Angelo Nieves said on Sunday that his office's computer investigator missed the June 16, 2008 Internet search.

It is not known who performed the search but it was allegedly done with a browser primarily used by the two-year-old's mother, Casey Anthony, who was acquitted of the girl's murder in 2011.

Anthony's attorneys argued during trial that Casey Anthony helped her father, George Anthony, cover up the girl's drowning in the family pool.

WKMG reports that sheriff's investigators pulled 17 vague entries only from the computer's Internet Explorer browser, not the Mozilla Firefox browser commonly used by Casey Anthony. More than 1,200 Firefox entries, including the suffocation search, were overlooked.

Whoever conducted the Google search looked for the term 'fool-proof suffication', misspelling 'suffocation', and then clicked on an article about suicide that discussed taking poison and putting a bag over one's head.

The browser then recorded activity on the social networking site MySpace, which was used by Casey Anthony but not her father.

A computer expert for Anthony's defense team found the search before the trial. Her lead attorney, Jose Baez, first mentioned the search in his book about the case but suggested it was George Anthony who conducted the search after Caylee drowned because he wanted to kill himself.

Not knowing about the computer search, prosecutors had argued Caylee was poisoned with chloroform and then suffocated by duct tape placed over her mouth and nose. The girl's body was found six months after she disappeared in a field near the family home and was too decomposed for an exact cause of death to be determined.

Prosecutors presented evidence that someone in the Anthony home searched online for how to make chloroform, but Casey Anthony's mother, Cindy, claimed on the witness stand that she had done the searches by mistake while looking up information about chlorophyll.

Many jurors apparently went into hiding amid public outrage over the verdict and refused to comment but two have said prosecutors couldn't conclusively prove how Caylee died.

Prosecutors Linda Drane Burdick and Jeff Ashton didn't respond to emails from The Associated Press on Sunday.

But Ashton told WKMG that 'it's just a shame we didn't have it. This certainly would have put the accidental death claim in serious question'.

Baez didn't respond to phone or email messages on Sunday but told WKMG that he expected prosecutors to bring up the search at trial.

'When they didn't, we were kind of shocked,' Baez, who no longer represents Anthony, told the station.

Her attorney, Cheney Mason, who was also on the trial team, didn't return an email on Sunday, and his office answering service refused to take a phone message.

The sheriff's office didn't consult the FBI or Florida Department of Law Enforcement for help searching the computer in the Anthony case, a mistake investigators have learned from, Nieves said.

Prosecutors had argued that Anthony suffocated Caylee with chloroform, then taped her mouth shut.

Her partially-decomposed body was found in a garbage bag dumped in a swamp on December 11, 2008 - nearly six months after she was left seen alive by her grandparents.

That same day, Casey visited her parents at their home in Orange County, Florida, along with her daughter Caylee. It was the last time the child was seen alive.

The next day, Caylee went missing and George and Cindy repeatedly asked Casey what had happened to their granddaughter.

Prosecutors tried to convict Casey Anthony using key pieces of information that they claimed proved her guilt in the murder.

It was alleged that that Anthony used chloroform to knock out her daughter Caylee.

While the girl was unconscious, prosecutors said Anthony put duct tape over Caylee’s mouth, which suffocated the toddler.

The word ‘chloroform’ was searched on a computer in the Anthony home 84 times as well as 'neck breaking' and 'household weapons' before the girl's disappearance.

In addition, a police K-9 agent testified that his cadaver dog, Gerus, detected human decomposition in the trunk of Anthony’s car.

Another agent testified that her dog, Bones, had detected human decomposition in the backyard of the Anthony family home.

When she was first questioned by police, Anthony insisted that she had not seen Caylee since she left her in the care of a babysitter, whom she identified as Zenaida Fernandez-Gonzalez, a woman who police could never link to the murder.

However, a woman with that name was not involved with Caylee’s disappearance.

That woman is now suing Anthony for defamation, claiming she was fired from her job, kicked out of her apartment and subjected to death threats as a result of her questioning.

Finally, on July 15, 2008 - 31 days after that visit - Cindy Anthony called police to report that Caylee had vanished.

On March 17, 2008 - months before the
toddler's disappearance - chloroform, neck-breaking, head injuries, 
ruptured spleen, chest trauma, inhalation and internal bleeding, were 
all searched in either Google on Wikipedia on the family computer.

The
fragmented search results were recovered from the hard drive, even 
though the computer's internet browsing history had been deleted.

The
search for 'chloroform,' typed in 84 times before Caylee's 
disappearance, became a key piece of the prosecution's case - brought 
up during opening statements and several times during the trial.

Cindy
Anthony claimed she was the one who had searched for the word, saying 
that she thought her dog was being poisoned by eating bamboo leaves from
the garden.

She said the 
initial search was for 'chlorophyll,' Cindy said she later found herself
searching for information on the toxic chemical.

Prosecutors later proved the Cindy was at work when most of the searches took place.

Chloroform vapors can knock even healthy adults unconscious when they are inhaled. In large doses, the gas can be fatal.

'There is something wrong. I found my daughter's car today and it smells like there's been a dead body in the damn car,' she told a 911 operator.  It is unknown how detectives missed that key piece of evidence.

Other searches on the Anthonys' computer had been introduced into evidence.

Baez rejected the report as an example of 'the standard anti-Casey spin.'

He told the Orlando Sentinel that any revelations coming from the WKMG report are '100 per cent false.'

Concerned: George and Cindy Anthony last saw their granddaughter on June 16, 2008 - the day she came to visit with Casey

Tragedy: Caylee's body was found in December 2008 - about six months after she was last seen. Her mother Casey was the prime suspect in her death
