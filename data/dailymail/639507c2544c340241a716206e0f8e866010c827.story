School officials in Northern California will meet this week to decision if they should ditch the ‘racist’ American Indian mascot of a local high school.

District administrators will recommend that the school board approve changing Vallejo High's Apache mascot at Wednesday's board meeting.

The mascot, first adopted decade ago, has long been a source of tension between people who believe it honors the Apache and those who feel it is offensive to American Indians.

District administrators will meet this week to vote on dumping Vallejo High's Apache mascot, which critics argue is offensive to American Indians

The contentious issue was raised two weeks ago during the school’s last board meeting.

Supporters of both points of view spilled out of the crammed board meeting and into the hallways and an overflow space of the district office, reports The Vallejo Times Herald.

During the section for public comments, most speakers spoke in favor of changing the mascot because of the offense it causes to some indigenous people.

‘What you're doing - using native images and native names - it's racist, it's demeaning,’ Local resident Karen Doris Wright told the board.

Coachella Valley High School has been criticized for their team's name the 'Arabs' and for their 'stereotypical' mascot who makes appearances at school sporting events and dances along with high school cheerleaders

Despite the urging of mascot opponents during that session, board members couldn’t make a decision since the item wasn’t on the agenda.

A staff report by Vallejo City Unified School District says the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights recommends avoiding the use of Native American images and nicknames.

The report does not offer a specific replacement for the Apache mascot, but officials say the school will likely retain its colors even if the board approves the mascot change.

A large number of schools have already changed their mascots in acknowledgement of the sensitivities surrounding the use of the word Apache.

There remain 14 high schools that still have Apache mascots in the United States, according to maxpreps.com, a website that tracks high school sports teams.

Washington's NFL team, the 'Redskins' has also come in for concerted pressure from Native American activists and a few media outlets, along with President Barack Obama, to change its name

This latest controversy follows hot on the heels of a similar story in Southern California, where school officials at Coachella Valley High School are under fire from anti-discrimination groups for their team's name the 'Arabs' and for their 'stereotypical' mascot.

School officials say that they will consider changing their mascot but that their team name will remain.

School superintendent Daryl Adams said that the team name the 'Arabs' has been in place ever since the 1920s.

During a meeting with the school board on Friday night, Adams said he would meet with the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee sometime this week to address their concerns.

The Committee sent a letter to the school complaining that the mascot was a stereotypical portrayal of Arab culture.

Washington's NFL team, the ‘Redskins’ has also come in for concerted pressure from Native American activists and a few media outlets, along with President Barack Obama, to change its name.
