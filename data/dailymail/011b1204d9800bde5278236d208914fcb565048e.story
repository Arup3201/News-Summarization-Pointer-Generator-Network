Michael Schumacher has a team of 15 medical experts treating him at a special clinic built in the grounds of his mansion home in Switzerland, with wage bills and medical equipment rental costing more than an estimated £100,000 a week.

The Lausanne rehabilitation clinic which Schumacher, 45, left two weeks ago to return home - 254 days after suffering catastrophic head injuries during a ski holiday - confirmed it has trained-up the experts now attempting to get the seven-times world champion to live a normal life.

A spokesman for the clinic confirmed: 'A large part of the team that cares for Michael now was trained by our specialists. We are following his treatment and are still a point of contact and entirely at his disposal.'

Schumacher's manager Sabine Kehm said last week he was not moving home because his medical condition had significantly changed. It is understood he remains mute and immobile with only periodic movements of his eyes. Experts call this the 'minimal consciousness' phase of a coma awakening.

Schumacher was placed in an artificial coma on December 29 last year after smashing his head onto rocks while skiing at the French Alpine resort of Meribel. He remained in the coma for 159 days and was moved to Lausanne from the University Hospital of Grenoble just weeks ago.

Manfred Spitzer, medical director at a specialist brain hospital in Germany, told the country's BILD newspaper: 'I do not know the condition of Michael Schumacher, but if it is stable, then the familiar surroundings of his home can certainly help for now.

'Such emotional stimulation is very important for patients who have suffered a severe brain trauma.' 

Schumacher's father Rolf is moving from his home in Germany at the end of the year to live in a house built in the grounds of the £35million  Gland mansion to be near his son. The Formula 1 legend's children Mick, 15, and Gina-Maria, 17, are said to spend hours every day at his bedside.

There were so many journalists  camped outside Schumacher's house on the shores of Lake Geneva last week that Swiss police were forced to move in and shield the property.

A Russian TV crew was even reportedly trying to broadcast live from outside the house. 

The family has its own private security teams who patrol the house 24-hours a day, but the police intervened when some journalists strayed on to the grounds in an attempt to catch a glimpse of the former Formula One ace. 

Seven-times Formula One world champion Schumacher has not been home for almost nine months since embarking on a skiing holiday with his family in the French resort of Meribel.
