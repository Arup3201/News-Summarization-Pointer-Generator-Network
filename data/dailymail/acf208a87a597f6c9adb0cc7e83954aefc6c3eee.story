No good deed goes unnoticed - no matter how small it may seem at the time.

On January 16 in Serbia, a man called Zoran Pavlovic, was heading home to meet a few friends.

When he got there, they told him that there was a small dog stranded on one of the Nisava river islands.  

Although Pavlovic and his friends headed over in hopes of helping, once they arrived there didn't believe that there was much that could be done without gear and tools.

They began calling several pet rescue facilities in the area, but only one good Samaritan, a man called Sasa Pesic, who works at a dog shelter in Nis, Serbia, was willing to come to their aide.

With hardly a second of consideration for his own safety, Pesic climbed down from the highway overpass and waded across the river to the island where the dog was sitting.  

On January 16, a man called Zoran Pavlovic was heading home in Serbia, when he and some friends heard about a stranded dog under a bridge overpass

Sasa Pesic, who works at dog shelter in Nis, Serbia, came to the dog's aide - quickly climbing down from the overpass onto the river island

After gaining the dog's trust, he lifted it up and carried him back toward the highway bridge

Pesic passed the dog up to a man who was waiting atop a stone column, who then passed it further along to several men standing on the bridge

Pesic was then helped back up onto the brick column - and onto the overpass - following his heroic deed

Although it took several minutes for the dog to fully emerge from the bushes, Pesic quickly gathered the dog in his arms and began to wade back toward the overpass column.

He passed the dog to another passer-by who was standing on top of the brick column that serves to prop up the bridge.

Pesic handed the dog to the middle man, who then quickly passed the dog off to the man on the bridge, before helping the everyday hero back up onto the road.
