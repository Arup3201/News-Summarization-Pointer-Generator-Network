This frightening photo shows how a young man's leg swelled to nearly four times its normal size in a life-threatening medical episode he believes was triggered by a game of limbo.  

Dylan Skilton, 19, from the Central Coast of New South Wales, is learning to walk again after an alarming medical scare where blood in his leg became clotted in late October.

Doctors twice told his family he was going to die during the episode caused by the Factor V Leiden blood disorder, a condition that rarely causes clots in fit young people. 

At one point during the months-long ordeal, doctors were removing 9L of fluid from his leg each day. 

Dylan believes he first began experiencing symptoms after playing the popular party game in mid-October.

'They were taking 9 litres of fluid, a day, out of my leg': Doctors sliced open Dylan Skilton's leg after it swelled up dramatically after a game of limbo. His leg swelled because of clotting caused by his Factor V Leiden disorder

Dylan Skilton was a very fit, healthy young man (left), telling Daily Mail Australia he did 80 push ups every night. But the disorder left him hospitalised for weeks (right) and doctors twice told his family he was going to die

Cleaved open: Doctors had to slice open Dylan's leg to clear the clots and reduce his leg swelling

'They called my parents and told them to come in straight away', Dylan told Daily Mail Australia as he continues on his path to recovery

'I had a sore back at the start, a couple of weeks before it all happened. I thought I did that doing limbo, of all things,' he told Daily Mail Australia. 

'I went to the doctors and got a CT scan and all that and he said, "you've probably just pulled muscles." And then I started to get a swollen leg.'

Within a couple of weeks his leg had become more sore - made even worse when he fell off his bike.

He was hospitalised on October 28 after finding himself completely immobilised by his engorged leg.

Blood clotted from below his kidneys to his heel and blood had pooled behind his stomach.

He was immediately admitted to Gosford Hospital for emergency surgery, with doctors slicing him open. 

'They called my parents and told them to come in straight away,' Dylan told Daily Mail Australia, recounting the hours after he was taken into hospital in late October. 

'That night they took me down and it was only going to be a three hour operation. (I) said goodbye to mum, said "mum I love you".

'That was about 10pm at night. I didn't come out until 5 in the morning. 

'They went to my mum and dad saying, "we've done all we can. We don't think he's going to make the day."

'I wasn't awake or anything but I can imagine how bad it would have been.'

After six days in an induced coma, Dylan woke. 

But within ten days all of his clots returned, plus an additional one in his pulmonary artery, because of an allergic reaction to blood medication.  

He was whisked to St Vincent's Hospital in Sydney's inner east on November 8 where - for a second time - doctors told the family he was likely going to die during an operation to remove the clots. 

'I was awake this time, so I was a bit shocked. I was like, "this is a little crazy",' Dylan said. 

Doctors managed to save both his life and his leg, although he is now unable to lift his toes or his ankle.

Haematologist Dr Trevor Forster, from the Queensland University of Technology, told Daily Mail Australia a clotting episode could have been triggered by a trauma such as limbo.  

'It is entirely possible he constricted a vessel or damaged a vessel doing an activity, and because of his Factor V Leiden the clotting process just went on uncontrolled,' Dr Forster said. 

Dr Forster said clotting episodes could be a 'life changing' event. 

After 15 operations, Dylan has stabilised and is currently in Gosford Rehabilitation Hospital, learning to walk again and taking blood thinning medication. 

'I'm hobbling around. I can walk - not well - but I can limp,' he told Daily Mail Australia. 

'I walk like a duck without my crutches. I'm pretty stable with them'. 

'Everything's coming out alright now, I'm feeling a bit better.'
