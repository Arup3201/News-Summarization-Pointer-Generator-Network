When these five baby animals were all abandoned by their mothers their chances of survival were slim.

But now the three lions, a tiger, and a spotted hyena are having a happier time at the Akwaaba Lodge in Rustenburg, South Africa, where they live under one roof.

The owner of the four- star hotel, Layla Cajee, has raised the cubs from birth.

Special bond: Five of nature's most fearful beasts have formed a bond - after they were abandoned by their mothers

Bright future: The babies - three lions, a tiger, and a spotted hyena are having a roaring good time at the Akwaaba Lodge in Rustenburg, South Africa, where they live under one roof

Layla said: 'They do squabble over food and the dominant one - the tiger - will come and take her share first. But I try to ensure that all the animals get the same amount and the same cut of meat to prevent them from fighting. After meal times they usually cuddle up together and have a nap'

Leader: Bella the tiger, is five months and is the leader of the pack, while the three lions, Delano, Romeo and Maximus, are also five months

She said: 'The animals were born in 
the lodge but I had to adopt them after they were rejected by their 
mothers - for being the runts of the family.

'In
the wild, they would not have stood a chance of survival without their 
mother's protection. So it's nice to see them growing up together.'

Bella
the tiger, five months, is the leader of the pack, while the three 
lions, Delano, Romeo and Maximus, are also five months, but more timid.

Meanwhile the eldest - Milika the hyena, six months - is the most mischievous in the motley crew.

Layla said: 'The naughtiest of them all is Milika - she's very boisterous and likes to play fight with her siblings.'

Time for tea: The five orphans all hungrily gather around a piece of meat at dinner time

Mischievous: The eldest - Milika the hyena, six months - is the most mischievous in the motley crew

The animals share the same living enclosures and even share meal times together.

But these cute cuddly creatures will 
transform into predators in two year's time - so they will be split up 
and live in separate enclosures.
