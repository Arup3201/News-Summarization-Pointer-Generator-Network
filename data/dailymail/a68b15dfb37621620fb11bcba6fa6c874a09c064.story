An Alabama man has been charged with DUI manslaughter in the hit-and-run death of a popular Oklahoma State University student early Friday morning.

Kasey Waychoff, 19, was on spring break in the beach town of Gulf Shores, Alabama, when she was hit by a pickup truck allegedly driven by 29-year-old Justin Lott.

About 1:45 a.m. Friday, Waychoff was walking with some of her sorority sisters in the bike lane in the 1400 block of West Beach Boulevard when she allegedly was struck by Lott's truck.

Drunk: Authorities say 29-year-old Justin Lott was drunk when he hit Waychoff, who was walking with her sorority sisters near the beach

'There was sorority sisters running and screaming and we knew someone 
was hurt,' a woman who was staying in a rental home nearby told WKRG.

'We had already had blue lights coming through our windows. Things 
intensified, we heard all the sirens. Of course we looked out the front 
window and saw that something was horribly wrong by the reactions from 
the college kids,' the witness continued.

After hitting the young co-ed, authorities say Lott didn't stop to see if she was alright and just continued driving.

Baldwin County sheriff's deputies were given a description of the vehicle that struck Waychoff, A deputy on duty - who had heard the description of the suspect truck - spotted Lott's vehicle not far from where Waychoff was hit and pulled him over.

Tragic: Waychoff is survived by a loving family, including a brother with whom she was very close and also went to Oklahoma State

The officers noted that the truck appeared to have front-end damage consistent with hitting a person.

'During the vehicle stop, the deputy conducted a DUI investigation after
 the driver displayed symptoms of being under the influence of alcohol,'
 according to a Gulf Shores Police Department news release. 

Waychoff leaves behind a loving family, including a grandfather who always caller her his 'baby girl.'

Handy Waychoff, Kasey's 79-year-old grandfather, told AL.com that his granddaughter had a brother who also attends Oklahoma State with whom she was especially close.

'This is just going to kill him,' Handy Waychoff said.

The Federal Bureau of Investigation has been called in to assist local authorities with the investigation.

Lott, who authorities say admitted to drinking alcohol the night of the incident, is being held without bond at the Baldwin County Correctional Facility.
