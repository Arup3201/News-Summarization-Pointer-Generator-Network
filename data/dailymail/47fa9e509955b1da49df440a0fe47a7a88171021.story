The UK's most revered technology entrepreneur, known as 'Britain's Bill Gates', has denied masterminding a £3billion accounting cover-up as a bitter row with his former bosses at Hewlett Packard intensified today.

Dr Mike Lynch made more than £500million by selling his home-grown software firm Autonomy last year in a £7.1billion deal but now the American company has wiped £5.5billion ($8.8bn) off its value.

HP boss Meg Whitman blames ‘accounting improprieties’ by 'certain former Autonomy employees' for the £3billion loss, accusing Lynch and others of 'lying' to them by inflating revenues and profit margins for at least two years before the deal was struck.

But Dr Lynch denies the claims and says that the 300 auditors HP had poring over their books would have picked up any problems. Tonight he ruled out legal action against those making the claims and pointed the finger at HP.

Appearing on Sky News, he told Jeff Randall: 'HP was once a great company. If that business can get back to its core and fix itself then I think Autonomy will have a good future. HP needs to stop trying to deflect attention away from itself.'

After the write-off, HP's shares dropped to $11 yesterday - down 12 per cent - the lowest level for HP in a decade.

Dr Lynch, 47, who is a non-executive director of the BBC and adviser to David Cameron, could now face a criminal investigation by the Serious Fraud Office and today said he was furious about the claims levelled at him and rejected them all.

He lives in a £6millon Grade II-listed Georgian manor house in Suffolk, with eight bedrooms and five bathrooms, and sits in 70 acres of grounds with private woodland, paddocks, a swimming pool, four cottages and a lodge.

'The figures are just mad. Things would have to have gone pretty badly wrong to justify writing $8.8bn,' Dr Lynch said in his rebuttal.

'It
is utterly untrue. We reject this as utterly untrue. Everything we did 
we gave correctly to the auditors and was correctly noted by the 
auditors.

'I don't 
understand how you can write-down this amount and say somehow this was 
all caused by something you didn't notice when you did due diligence 
with 300 people. It would have been kind of a big elephant to miss.'

According to HP, evidence of an accounting cover-up was 
apparently revealed to them by a former Autonomy executive whistleblower within the last
six months.

It has already been passed to financial prosecutors on both
sides of the Atlantic.

Lynch has 'flatly rejected' the accusations and said he was 'shocked' but confident he would be absolved of any misdeeds

He left HP after Autonomy missed budget forecasts and says that Autonomy has been mismanaged since his exit.

Tech giant: Hewlett-Packard, based in Palo Alto in California, has taken a £5.5billion hit after accusing staff at Autonomy - a British company it purchased last year - of cooking the books to increase its company value

Dr Lynch is on the BBC's executive board and said today that it had spoken to him and would not ask him to resign as a non executive director.

A spokesman told MailOnline: 'The BBC has spoken to Dr Mike Lynch regarding the allegations made against his company in the media.  We note that the company has denied the allegations. 

'We have not asked Dr Lynch to step down from his role as a BBC Non-Executive Director. We will continue to monitor the situation as it develops and will take any further action should it become necessary.'

HP also said it would also 
‘aggressively pursue’ individual Autonomy executives to recoup financial
damages for its shareholders.

The allegations come six months after 
Dr Lynch walked away from the business he founded after he fell out with
management, insiders say.

New Yorker Meg Whitman is arguably 
America's most successful businesswoman with a CV littered with jobs 
at some of the world's biggest companies.

The
mother-of-two is the fourth wealthiest woman in California with a net 
worth of $1.3billion, mainly built up while serving as eBay’s chief executive 
from 1998 to 2008.

In that 
time she started with 30 employees and boosted it to 15,000 staff 
within a decade, drawing in an incredible $8bn in annual revenues.

Previously
she had worked at giants like Walt Disney, DreamWorks, Procter & 
Gamble and Hasbro before joining Hewlett Packard on an annual salary of 
$1 - but also around $16million of stock options and other perks 
including a company plane.

She
also attempted a political career and in 2010 shattered the record for 
the biggest spending candidate in any U.S. election in history.

She
splashed out a staggering $119 million of her own money in her failed 
bid to succeed Arnold Schwarzenegger as California’s next Republican 
governor.

By shelling out 
another $15 million from her hi-tech fortune , she surpassed the $109 
million spent by New York mayor Michael Bloomberg on his 2009 
re-election campaign.

Her track-record in business is hallmarked with her reputation for her determination in driving companies to success.

When he started a 
software company in his garage in 1996, Mike Lynch could not have dreamt
he would one day sell it for more than £7billion.

Those who knew 
him well say that Lynch is intelligent driven, and ambitious, and 
predicted the sale of Autonomy, which netted him just over half a 
billion pounds, would not be the last that we would hear of Dr Lynch.

Little
were they to know that he would reappear as he did yesterday, with the 
allegations levelled by Hewlett Packard throwing him back into the 
spotlight.

After he was born in County Tipperary in Ireland in 
1965 to a fireman and a nurse, Lynch’s family moved to Chelmsford, Essex
while he was still a child.

There Mike showed early signs of his fierce intelligence, and won a scholarship to the nearby private school Bancroft’s.

He
went on to study physics, maths and biochemistry at Christ’s College, 
Cambridge, before opting to spend the next years of his life in 
academia.

It was the miracle growth of Autonomy that earned him the title ‘Britain’s Bill Gates’.

He was given an OBE in 1996 and a year later was appointed to the BBC executive committee as a non-executive director.

He
lives in a Grade II listed Georgian manor house in Suffolk, although it
is not known whether he has a family at the massive home.The £6m estate has 70 acres of grounds and is surrounded by private woodland.

Autonomy rose from humble beginnings 
in 1996 to become a darling of the City and a member of the FTSE 100 
index of the UK’s biggest companies.

It was seen as a great success story 
of British innovation, providing computer programs that processed large 
amounts of data to thousands of small businesses.

Software giant Oracle says it had the chance to buy Autonomy but decided it was incredibly over-priced, its founder Larry Ellison has said.

The world's sixth richest man said Mike Lynch approached him with a deal but he balked at the proposed $6bn value.

'We looked at the price and thought it was absurdly high,' he said a month after HP did the deal.

It then turned into a war of words between him and Dr Lynch, who said: 'If some bank happened to come with us on a list, that is nothing to do with us.”

But Oracle then declared it was 'another whopper from Autonomy CEO Mike Lynch.'

The statement went on: 'Either Lynch has a very poor memory or he’s lying.

'Some bank did not just happen to come to Oracle with Autonomy "on a list." The truth is that Mr. Lynch came to Oracle, along with his investment banker.'

To further embarrass Lynch, Oracle then released a slides detailing Autonomy’s financial health they had received.

Ten years after founding the firm, 
Irish-born and Cambridge-educated Dr Lynch was awarded an OBE.

HP’s chief executive Meg Whitman, was not in charge when it bought Autonomy.

Former HP boss Leo Apotheker led the acquisition of Autonomy and in his two years in charge the company's share valuedropped by 45 per cent, with a big dip when they completed the deal.

She issued a strongly worded 
statement about the affair.

She alleged that ‘some former members 
of Autonomy’s management team used accounting improprieties, 
misrepresentations and disclosure failures to inflate the underlying 
financial metrics of the company, prior to Autonomy’s acquisition by 
HP’.

She added: ‘These efforts appear to 
have been a wilful effort to mislead investors and potential buyers, and
severely impacted HP management’s ability to fairly value Autonomy at 
the time of the deal.’

Miss Whitman has passed details of the
financial cover-ups to the UK’s Serious Fraud Office and its US 
equivalent, the Securities and Exchanges Commission, ‘for civil and 
criminal investigation’.

Although she refused to name the 
executives who were likely to be questioned, she said ‘a senior member 
of Autonomy’s leadership team came forward [with the details] following 
the departure of Mike Lynch’.

It is thought to be unlikely that any financial cover-up would occur without the knowledge of Dr Lynch.

A PR company acting for Dr Lynch 
yesterday issued a statement saying he was ‘shocked to see this 
statement today, and flatly rejects these allegations, which are false’.

It added: ‘HP’s senior management has also been closely involved with running Autonomy for the past year.

‘It took ten years to build Autonomy’s
industry-leading technology and it is sad to see how it has been 
mismanaged since its acquisition by HP.’

The SFO refused to comment on whether it would launch an investigation.
