James Collins is set to play a key role in Wales' Euro 2016 campaign but manager Chris Coleman admits he chose Cardiff's busiest shopping centre for peace talks between the pair so things could not turn ugly.

Collins will win his 45th cap in Wales' crunch qualifier against Israel on Saturday night with Hull defender James Chester sidelined by a dislocated shoulder.

But it was not so long ago that the West Ham defender's international career appeared over after player and manager fell out following Collins' withdrawal from a Wales squad.

Collins contradicted Coleman's claim he had turned down the chance to join the squad as a late call-up prior to the World Cup qualifier against Serbia in September 2013 and the pair had a tense public rapprochement in the middle of Cardiff.

'We had a coffee in the middle of St David's Shopping Centre so it could not kick off!' Coleman revealed. 'There were too many people around so we had to be civil.

'We had our spat, but I have known him since he was a kid and always liked him, and when he has been with us he has been right in the middle of everything. His presence and personality are going to be very important going forward.'

Collins has had to bide his time to regain his place at the heart of the Wales defence with Chester having developed an excellent understanding with skipper Ashley Williams since making his international debut last summer.

The 31-year-old has yet to feature in a campaign which sees Wales unbeaten after four games and within a point of Group B leaders Israel.

But asked if falling out with him has made Collins value Wales more, Coleman replied: 'Yes, absolutely. I think that is the case.

'This is an opportunity for 'Ginge' now. He was brilliant in the last camp, as were Danny Gabbidon and Sam Ricketts who did not play but were great round the dressing room in Brussels.

'That is great for the younger guys because it is good to have advice from senior players.

''Ginge' likes the challenge and the atmosphere we will find ourselves in, it will be a dogfight which he enjoys.'

Wales are unbeaten but a point behind Israel in Group B, with the table toppers also having a game in hand having won all three of their opening Euro 2016 qualifiers

Coleman also played down security concerns ahead of Wales' first trip to Israel since the two countries met in a play-off qualifier for the 1958 World Cup in Sweden.

Israel have a game in hand on Wales as their September fixture with Belgium was postponed because of the political situation in the Middle East at the time but that match will now be played next Tuesday.

'We have not got any extra security to my knowledge,' Coleman said.

'I did the journey from the airport to the hotel when I was out there last month and we will treat it like any other game.

'We know a lot is going on in certain quarters but there are no worries, there are no extra precautions that we would not usually take.'
