When you are a living the life of a busy royal, every minute is precious.

And Prince Charles appeared to be making the most of some downtime when he took the opportunity to catch up on a spot of paperwork, while being driven along the M4 in his classic Aston Martin.

Motorist Mo Dambha, 28, spotted the Prince of Wales in the blue soft top convertible.

A stunned motorist could not believe his eyes when a classic Aston Martin pulled up alongside him  - with Prince Charles in the passenger seat

He quickly snapped the royal relaxing and reading while his driver chauffeured him along the M4 motorway just outside of London.

Prince Charles was wearing a pair of sunglasses and a grey suit, and was studying some documents in a red folder.

Mr Dambha said he was not sure it was the heir to the throne until a green Range Rover full of bodyguards told him to stop filming.

Presumably heading for his home in Windsor, Prince Charles was looking cool in a pair of sunglasses and a grey suit, and was studying some documents in a red folder

Prince Charles' 1969 Aston Martin Volante DB6 MKII, given to him by the Queen on his 21st birthday, is one of the rarest Aston Martins ever made, with only 12 thought to have been produced

'They cut me up on the M4 as I was taking the pictures and waved at me to stop,' Mr Dambha, a pharmacist from central London, said.

'I wasn't sure if it was him at first, but when they told me stop, I knew it was him.

'I sped up so I could take a couple more pictures, before he zoomed down an off-ramp.'
