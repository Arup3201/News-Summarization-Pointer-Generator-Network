Privately educated Kunal Chaudhary, 32, was a senior manager at Deloitte in Manchester. Seemingly respectable, he was secretly a sex trafficker

An accountant at one of Britain’s top firms led a double life as a sex trafficker.

Privately educated Kunal Chaudhary, 32, was a senior manager at Deloitte in Manchester.

Outwardly respectable, he was secretly part of a gang who tricked women into coming to Britain where they were forced to have sex with up to 20 men a day.

Almost all the victims were trafficked from Hungary. Many applied online for what they believed were administrative, cleaning and babysitting jobs.

After their arrival in England, however, they were forced or coerced into prostitution at brothels around London.

Kunal Chaudhary worked at Deloitte’s Spinningfields offices in Manchester city centre and was part of a criminal ring based in London that controlled at least 120 women with threats of violence and intimidation. The gang would also take hold of their passports to exert further control over them.

Ring leader Vishal Chaudhary, 35, used various pseudonyms, including Rahul Singh and Aresh Khan, in order to disguise his true identity.

Until days before his arrest, he lived in a smart block of flats in Canary Wharf and drove a Mercedes convertible, as part of his comfortable lifestyle.

Vishal and Kunal Chaudhary, along with three other accomplices, were arrested early last year.

Croydon Crown Court heard how flights were booked for at least 120 women, while others picked the women up from Stansted airport and delivered them to brothels in Barnet, Camden, Waltham Forest, Haringey, Tower Hamlets, Lambeth, Brent, Westminster, Enfield, Hounslow, Islington and Kensington and Chelsea. They charged clients between £30 and £100 per hour.

Kunal Chaudhary denied any wrongdoing but was found guilty after a trial at Croydon Crown Court. He was convicted of conspiracy to traffic persons into the UK for sexual exploitation, conspiracy to control prostitution and concealing criminal property.

He will be sentenced with his co-defendants at a later date.

A spokesman for Deloitte said: ‘Kunal Chaudhary is a former employee of the firm.

‘The police have made it clear that these terrible offences were not in any way connected with his employment at Deloitte.

‘As soon as the charges were confirmed, he was suspended without pay and following his conviction he was dismissed without notice.’
