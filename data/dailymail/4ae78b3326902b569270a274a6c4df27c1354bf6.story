A mother accused in the deaths of her two children found locked in a hot car after she fell asleep is on suicide watch, her attorney has said.

Samantha Harper, 25, held on child abuse charges is said to be 'distraught' and still
coming to terms after discovering her two children, aged 2 and 3, passed out
inside her vehicle on August 2 in Smyrna, Tennessee.

Police said Harper admitted putting the children in the car
and then falling asleep inside her house, which has since been condemned after
found by authorities in 'deplorable' conditions.

In her court hearing on Thursday Harper's appointed
attorney, Gerald Melton, described the children’s' death as a 'tragic
accident,' the Daily News Journal reports.

Harper faces two counts of especially aggravated child
abuse.

Three-year-old Daniel Marise and her 
two-year-old sister Savannah were found dead by their mother after 
having been left there for more than an hour.

Officials said temperatures outside the vehicle would have been in the mid 90s, but far hotter inside.

'You
put someone in a car with the windows rolled up, with no ventilation, 
it can increase the temperature easy 30 to 40 degrees inside the 
vehicle,' said Smyrna police spokesman Sgt. Bobby Gibson.

Speaking with the Daily News Journal, Mr Melton said of his client: '[it's] been difficult to
communicate with her, not only because she lost her children, but because she
has been charged in this event. It’s a tragic event all the way around.'

Scene: Police said the two children Daniel and Savannah were lying next to a car in the driveway, dead from apparent heatstroke

Family and friends of Harper showed their support in the
court room on Thursday as she filed in wearing a green and white uniform,
signifying her placement on suicide watch.

A family member speaking with her attorney asked him
about working to lower her bond.

She's currently being held on $200,000 but her family said
they cannot afford the pay the 10 per cent needed for her release.

Police said the children's father was not home at the time of the incident, according to News Channel 5.

When officers arrived on the scene, they found the children lying on the ground next to the car.

Police also searched Harper's house during their investigation and found what they described as 'deplorable' conditions. The house has since been condemned by health officials and boarded up.

'We are going to follow every lead that we [get]. We are going to speak to everyone that we can that had knowledge of the children [and the] conditions of the home,' Sgt. Gibson said.

'It's hard to imagine that people would allow themselves to live in the conditions this house was in.'

Harper's aunt, Estella Ship, told News Channel 5 she still does not fully understand what happened and believes Harper was a good mother who loved her children.

'I just know her and I know her mother, and she wouldn't do that, she wanted babies every since she was a baby,' she said.

Smyrna police say Harper has no criminal history. But in September 2011, LaVergne Police filed a child neglect report against Harper, which resulted in a referral to the Department of Children's services.

Danger: Police also searched Harper's house during their investigation and found what they described as 'deplorable' conditions. The house has since been condemned by health officials and boarded up

Tributes: A memorial of flowers, signs and teddy bears now sits in the front yard of Harper's home, while neighbors stopped by throughout the day on Friday to pay their respects

A memorial of flowers, signs and teddy bears now sits in the front yard of Harper's home, while neighbors stopped by throughout the day on Friday to pay their respects.

'I just don't understand it. It broke my heart,' said neighbor Debbie Herston. 'This has to touch anyone who is a parent.'

Chrystal Stover tearfully brought her five-year-old Autumn to the site where they dropped off a teddy bear next to a bouquet of flowers. 'I just think it's sad, but God is looking over them,' said Autumn as she clutched her mother's side.

'Its heartbreaking to our community, they were just innocent little kids,' added her mother.

'It's really sad and I don't know how any parent could let their kid get into that situation and do that to their kid,' Teresa Alrodhni said.
