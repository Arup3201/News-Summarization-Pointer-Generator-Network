Roy Keane has pulled out of his role as an ITV World Cup pundit just two weeks before the tournament gets underway.

The former footballer, 42, is believed to be closing in on a deal to become assistant manager at Aston Villa, and has decided to put his media duties on hold to concentrate on his coaching career.

It is not the first time Keane has failed to take part in a World Cup at the last minute.

He was famously sent home from Ireland's squad during the 2002 World Cup in Japan and South Korea following a public row with manager Mick McCarthy.

Although the former
 Manchester United midfielder turned down a job as manager of Scottish 
Premier League champions Celtic last week, he is believed to be ready to
 take a job at Aston Villa.

Announcing
 his departure from ITV, a spokesperson said: 'Roy has been a tremendous
 part of our pundit team in recent years, but we fully understand his 
decision to concentrate wholly on his coaching. We wish him every 
success for the future.'

Keane has been a regular pundit for ITV's Champions League and England coverage in recent years, winning plaudits for his straight-talking and honest approach.

Multiple roles: It is believed Roy Keane has chosen to take the Aston Villa assistant manager job, as the role would allow him to continue as Martin O'Neill's number two with the Republic of Ireland (pictured)

Keane was involved in the channel's World Cup launch just two weeks ago alongside fellow pundits Lee Dixon, Gus Poyet, Fabio Cannavaro and Republic of Ireland boss Martin O'Neill.

But during an appearance with O'Neill at an event in London, Keane confirmed he will not travel to Brazil for the World Cup.

Keane had been expected to be appointed 
as Neil Lennon’s successor at Scottish champions Celtic.

But
 it is is believed he has now chosen to take the Aston Villa assistant 
manager job, as the role would allow him to continue as O’Neill’s number
 two with the Republic of Ireland. 

Villa
 manager Lambert and Keane held talks before Celtic’s failed attempt to 
land their former midfielder and he will now replace Ian Culverhouse, 
who was sacked as the assistant last month.

Keane's
 new role at Villa Park, where he will try to help the club improve on 
their miserable 15th place finish last season, may also allow him to 
continue his role as an ITV Champions League pundit.

Keane's decision to snub this summer's tournament in Brazil isn't the first time he has turned down a World Cup appearance.The tough-tackling midfielder fell out with Republic of Ireland boss Mick McCarthy ahead of the 2002 World Cup in Japan and South Korea after being left unimpressed by his country's preparation for the tournament.

Keane, who was playing for Manchester United at the time, had a furious row with McCarthy and told him: 'Mick, you're a liar... you're a f****** w*****. I didn't rate you as a player, I don't rate you as a manager, and I don't rate you as a person.

'You're a f****** w***** and you can stick your World Cup up your a***. The only reason I have any dealings with you is that somehow you are the manager of my country! You can stick it up your b*******.'

Unsurprisingly he was sent home by his manager. 

The general public in Ireland was divided about apportioning blame for the incident, with many agreeing that the side's preparations for the tournament were below par.

As Ireland's talismanic captain and best player, it came as little surprise that the country exited the World Cup after penalty shootout against Spain in the second round.
