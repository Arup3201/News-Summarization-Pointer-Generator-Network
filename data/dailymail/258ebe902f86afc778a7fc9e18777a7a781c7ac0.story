The BBC is saving £1.1billion a year compared to than seven years ago after slashing 1,000 staff and top talent - but could still have to take the axe to programmes, its finance director has warned.

Publishing a new report on ‘BBC efficiency’, Anne Bulford said the corporation still needs to find an extra £400million a year by 2017 and 'the challenge to avoid having to cut content is very real'.

The cuts included £35million a year from the £229million-a-year talent budget compared to five years ago, after widespread criticism of high salaries paid to top stars.

The departures of Susanna Reid and Jeremy Paxman have helped reduce the annual BBC talent budget

Former BBC presenters prompted anger when their salaries were revealed, including the £6million a year reportedly paid to Jonathan Ross before he moved to ITV in 2010.

Newsnight presenter Jeremy Paxman was also thought to be earning more than £500,000 before he left this year - with the highest-paid 'talent' now thought to be stars such as Graham Norton and Jeremy Clarkson.

The departure of Susanna Reid, who departed for ITV and a reported £400,000 salary in April, has also helped trim BBC budgets. 

But because many of the other cuts that were made to date - including more than 1,000 redundancies and a string of property sales - were one-off savings, bosses are expected to target the BBC programming budget next to save more cash.

The BBC’s director general Tony Hall has already announced plans to axe youth channel BBC3 and make it online-only, angering many of his own TV presenters.

But according to an insider, bosses are prepared to make further ‘tough choices’ in order to save more money, meaning services such as the arts channel BBC4 could also find itself under threat.

A source said yesterday that it is ‘increasingly likely’ that other stations and programmes will be slimmed down or cut as the corporation puts further pressure on its budgets.

Although no plans have been drawn up, the BBC would prefer to make a few dramatic cuts, such as by axing an entire channel, than to make many smaller savings to programme budgets.

Miss Bulford, who is paid £395,000 as the BBC’s managing director of finance and operations, said: ‘Many savings delivered in this charter period come from structural or one-off initiatives that can’t easily be repeated, making it more likely that content and services will be impacted if the real terms value of the Licence Fee continues to be reduced.’

In recent years, the BBC has repeatedly come under fire for wasting money. The controversial IT project known as the Digital Media Initiative was axed by Lord Hall at a cost of £100million to the licence fee payer.

And the corporation was castigated by MPs after a report by the National Audit Office discovered it had handed out £369million in severance payments to its staff over eight years.

However, Miss Bulford argued that the BBC’s efficiency ‘compares well’ to Government departments and boasted that it is ‘on track’ to achieve £1.5billion in savings by 2017.

To save more money, Lord Hall will introduce a ‘compete or compare’ strategy that will force programme makers to slash their costs and compete with independent production companies.

The decision to axe BBC3 – which is expected to save around £100million a year – must be approved by the corporation’s governing body before it can go ahead.

Stars including comedian Jack Whitehall and DJ Greg James have already criticised the idea in public. In 2010, the BBC was forced to abandon plans to axe Radio 6Music after its stars organised a vocal public protest.
