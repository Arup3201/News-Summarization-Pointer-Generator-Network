A bullied student frequently picked on by students was victimized by the one person expected to help him in those situations - his teacher.

Stephen Davis, 15, a freshman at Streamwood High School in Illinois, watched in horror as a cartoon-like sketch with buck teeth, hairy ears, bloodshot eyes, tentacles, a scar and a runny nose was labeled as 'Stephen's ugly ass' by a substitute teacher, who did this in front of his entire math class.

Davis, who weighs 330 pounds, recorded the entire incident on his phone, leaving no doubt as to what the teacher did.

CBS Chicago also reports that Stephen is a special needs student

'I was literally livid and embarrassed,' he told the Daily Herald in an interview.

'Everyone was standing there pointing at me, laughing, (while) I'm on the verge of tears.'

CBS Chicago also reports that Stephen is a special needs student. 

Making the situation even more difficult, Stephen said that he has always been picked on because of his weight, 'but I always learned to just move along. ... (It) is basically background noise.'

This as the school's two vice principals acknowledged that Stephen is 'always helpful and respectful toward his teachers.'

Now Stephen is taking a stand, and he and his family have shown the boy's video to school administrators.

'No other family should have to go through this suffering. This is unimaginable,' said Stephen.

'Everyone was standing there pointing at me, laughing, (while) I'm on the verge of tears,' said Stephen of the drawing

Stephen is also getting support on Facebook after his sister posted the video on a page dedicated to things that are happening in the school district.

'It's humiliating, and no one should ever have to go through that, and just the fact that it was a teacher makes it even worse,' said Brianna Davis. 

'No one should do this to anyone, let alone a child.' 

John Heiderscheidt, the district's coordinator of safety and security, said; 'We've reviewed the posting on Facebook and are examining any evidence or statements regarding the incident and anybody who might be involved.'

The teacher, who has not be identified, has been suspended.
