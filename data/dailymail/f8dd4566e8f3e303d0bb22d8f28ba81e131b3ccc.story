Amanda Knox today claimed she has been 'hunted' over the murder of British student Meredith Kercher as she defended her decision not to return to Italy to face retrial for the killing in her first live interview on British television.

The 26-year-old American said she was trying to rebuild her life after the 'ultimate nightmare' of being wrongfully convicted and imprisoned over the killing of Leeds University student Ms Kercher in November 2007.

Ms Knox said she is now trying to fight back against her accusers because she wasn't given the chance before and said she will take a lie detector test to prove her innocence.

Will not return to Italy: Amanda Knox today defended her decision not to return to Italy to a face a retrial over the murder of Meredith Kercher in an interview on ITV's Daybreak

Victim: Amanda Knox told Lorraine Kelly that she had been 'hunted down' over the murder of Meredith Kercher in November 2007

'I've been hunted. I'm being hunted down,' she told ITV’s Daybreak, adding: 'I'm trying to fight back now that I have the opportunity.'

Asked if she would be willing to take a 
lie detector test, Ms Knox said: 'I would do anything to prove my 
innocence. I don’t think that is necessary, but like I said, I am doing 
everything I can to prove my innocence.

'I am not afraid of anything. I have been put through a tremendous gauntlet.'

Ms Knox has denied any involvement in the killing of Ms Kercher, who was found with her throat slashed in the bedroom of the house they shared in Perugia, central Italy.

She was convicted along with her Italian former boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito following a high-profile trial, but the pair were later cleared in 2011 after an appeal court found the prosecution lacking and criticised large swathes of the case against them.

Innocent: Ms Knox today said she would take a lie detector test to prove her innocence over the murder

Starting again: Ms Knox, who now lives in Seattle, said she is trying to rebuild her life since being acquitted of the murder

Italy’s supreme court has ordered a new trial but Miss Knox, who now lives in Seattle, has said she will not attend.

She said: 'I have plenty to fear because I was already imprisoned wrongfully, I was already convicted wrongfully and this is everything to fear, this, as an innocent person, is the ultimate nightmare, this does not make sense.'

Ms Knox added that she is unable to afford to travel to Italy and remain in the country for the duration of a retrial.

Mr Sollecito, 29, has denied any involvement in the killing and has appealed for money to fund his new court battle.

He is due to face a retrial next Monday.

Explaining her reasons for not returning
to Italy for the retrial, Miss Knox said: 'There are many reasons why I
have made the decision.

Loss: British student Meredith Kercher was found killed in the apartment the girls shared in Perugia

'One of the major reasons is because I have done this, I have given testimony ... I can’t financially afford to be going back and forth to Italy.

'I am in school, I am trying to rebuild my life. Then there is the very real fact that I was imprisoned wrongfully and I cannot reconcile that experience with the choice of going back. It doesn’t make sense.

'This isn’t a complicated case. It has been resolved and for people to hold on to circumstantial things that have been proven wrong... At the very beginning, I never had a chance to defend myself. Over the course of the trial, it was shown that I wasn’t the monster that was being made of me.'

She added: 'There is proof of my innocence in there being no trace of me in the room where my friend was murdered.

'There was no reason for me to have done this, there is nothing that is a part of me that would ever do something like this.

'It is so scary to have go to through this again, I did not expect this to happen.

'And now I am not sure what to expect because I have two different experiences - I was wrongfully convicted and rightly acquitted for being innocent and now I have to hope that the next court is able to look at this without prejudice and realise that there is proof of my innocence here.

'This isn’t a case about a character, this isn’t a case about a femme fatale, this is a case about my friend who was brutally murdered as she just happened to be home that night.'

Ms Knox said she would like Ms Kercher's family to take her to visit her grave and believes that they can help one another with the grieving.

'The greatest closure is for them to 
be willing to take me to her grave. I never had a chance to see them 
before I was already called the murderer,' she said. 

Refusal: Speaking on the Today show, Amanda Knox said it was 'common sense' that she will not return to Italy for the re-trial in the murder of her British roommate in 2007. Knox was freed in 2010

Hitting back: Raffaele Sollecito, who was accused of murdering Meredith Kercher, says the police's handling of his case was 'incompetent'. He claims he was blackmailed into framing Amanda Knox for the crime

Ms
Knox said she understood why Ms Kercher's family might believe she was 
involved in her death but insisted the prosecution was wrong and asked 
them to consider her innocence.

'I can understand where they're coming from. I know that they think that I had some sort of involvement with Meredith's death.

'I would hope that they would eventually take into consideration even the possibility of my innocence. They need to understand that the prosecution is simply wrong and that their lawyers are wrong.

'I also want them to understand that Meredith really was my friend. She was very kind to me and I had nothing to do with her murder. And I am truly innocent. And I truly believe that the only way that any of us are going to be able to heal from all of this is if we come together and acknowledge the pain that we have all gone through.'

Ms Knox denied she had tried to cash in on Ms Kercher's death by writing her book, Waiting To Be Heard, which was published in the United States earlier this year, and said all the proceeds had gone on paying back her parents and lawyers.

'I am not sitting on a yacht somewhere - that's not the case,' she said.
