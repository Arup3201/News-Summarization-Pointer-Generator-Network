Wake-up call: Helen Rogers, 57, is being prosecuted for her cockerel's 'particularly noisy' crowing

They say the early bird gets the worm, but all Big Bird the cockerel manages to do is irritate his neighbours.

Chicken breeder Helen Rogers, 57, is being prosecuted for the animal's ‘particularly noisy’ crowing. 

Villagers say he wakes them at 3am and goes on ‘incessantly’ until 11pm, starting a chain reaction of crowing in Hambledon, Hampshire.

Officers from Winchester City Council have visited the site five times - and served Mrs Rogers with a noise abatement notice in August last year.

But she now been summoned to Fareham Magistrates' Court on Thursday accused of breaching the order on three occasions.

Mrs Rogers has denied the four-year-old Light Sussex cockerel is a nuisance or crows throughout the night.

And she claims she followed the council's advice to cover the coop with a black-out blanket at dusk and remove it no earlier than 9am.

'Several people in the village own cockerels and they all make a noise. That is what cockerels do,' she said.

'I don't understand people who live in the countryside and then complain about country noises such as animals and farm machinery.

'We have a school opposite the land where you can hear the children playing, and a church where the bells ring regularly.

'If you don't like this sort of thing you should move to the town or city instead. My cockerel is no more noisy than any other cockerel in the area and it is certainly not a nuisance.

'I keep it covered, so it does not crow at unreasonable hours. I am also unsure how anybody can tell the difference between my bird and any other.

Action: Officers from Winchester City Council (pictured) served Mrs Rogers with a noise abatement notice in August last year. But she now been summoned to court accused of breaching the order on three occasions.

'It is ridiculous and upsetting that I am being taken to court over something like this.'

Mrs Rogers breeds rare cockerels, chickens, and ducks on the land, previously known as St Peter's Farm.

It is home to seven ducks, 21 rare breed chickens, three normal chickens, two cockerels, six horses, one rabbit, and two dogs.

But the animal lover lives around 20 miles away in Chichester, West Sussex.

Mrs Rogers said she had received letters from the council, in which they said neighbours had complained about the 'incessant crowing'.

'One neighbour has said he would like to see Big Bird "dispatched" but there is no way I am doing that,' she said.

'If I have to I will move him elsewhere, but I won't kill him or give him away.'

Councillor Tony Coates, who represents the village on Winchester City Council, said the noise 'has been annoying half the village'.

He added: 'The countryside is noisy, smelly, and occasionally dangerous, and people who live here should put up with that to some extent.

'But this cockerel is an early-riser and particularly noisy. When it crows it starts a chain reaction among the other cockerels in the village.

'In this instance, it is a nuisance. It needs to be kept in a darkened coop, and its perch should be put higher up so it cannot extend its neck and crow."

Caroline Dibden, vice chairwoman of Hambledon Parish Council, said: 'It is a particularly noisy cockerel and wakes people up very early in the morning.

'Our single biggest attended parish council meetings are when St Peter's Farm is on the agenda.

'This particular issue is a real problem because it affects a lot of people.'
