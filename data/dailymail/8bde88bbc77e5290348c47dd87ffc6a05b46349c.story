Two weeks ago, Queen Maxima of the Netherlands sat politely through a talk on high tech toilets while visiting Japan.

Today, she was back on the factory floor as she toured a cheese co-operative close to Utrecht and opened Cono Cheesemaker's new building.

But although she had competition from a teetering stack of Beemster cheese wheels, all eyes were on the royal, who was glamorous in an all-gold ensemble.

Ever the professional, the Argentina-born Queen, 43, got involved in proceedings, helping factory bosses slice through a huge wheel of orange cheese - much to their delight.

The visit to Utrecht was a light-hearted end to a week that began with an emotional memorial service dedicated to the victims of the MH17 disaster.

During the event, Maxima, who was famously photographed wiping away tears as the first repatriation flight arrived in Eindhoven, and husband King Willem-Alexander heard the names of all 298 victims read out.

Two thirds of the dead were Dutch but British, Australians, Malaysians and Germans also perished when the Malaysia Airways flight to Kuala Lumpur was shot down.

Light-hearted: The visit ended a week that began with an emotional memorial service for the MH17 victims

Towards the end of the ceremony, which was attended by 1,600 family members, Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte gave a moving speech, which began:

'What if the holiday had started a day later? What if the plane had been late? What if I wake up and realise it was all just a dream?' 

Although Ukrainian separatists are thought to be responsible for shooting down the plane, investigations - and repatriation flights - continue.

Since the crash in July, Maxima's popularity has soared - partly as a result of her obvious sympathy and continuing support for victims' families.

She has also won plaudits for her glamorous sense of style, showcased, most recently, during a state visit to Japan and South Korea.
