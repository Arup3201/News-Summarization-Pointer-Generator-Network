Back home, when Luis Suarez did what we always knew Luis Suarez would do, 50 million Englishmen would have given everything to wipe that smile off his face.

Sadly, the 11 on the pitch in the Arena Sao Paulo did not have the same idea. You could even make a case that they had no idea.

England’s defence was dysfunctional and disorganised, brutally exposed at the very highest level of the game. Suarez picked them off, scoring two magnificent goals on a magical night for his country. Good for him.

England were petrified by his sheer presence on the field after five weeks out through injury. Yes he’s world class and yes it’s your job to stop him.

Tormentor: Luis Suarez was the star of the show as Uruguay beat England in Sao Paulo

Helpless: England's defence had no answer to a top-class striker for the second game in a row

Too hot to handle: Italy's Mario Balotelli posed England with a lot of problems in Manaus

England’s defending for the Uruguay’s opening goal was abject, a depressing re-run of Mario Balotelli’s header in Manaus on Saturday.

Allowing Suarez to run through unchecked to score their winner five minutes from time is worthy of an FA inquiry.  What were they doing? Maybe we will never know.

The FA will be willing the country to forgive and forget, to learn from our mistakes so that we can all be one big happy family at the next tournament. No chance, not after this.

England are as good as out of the World Cup in Brazil and that is unacceptable. Roy Hodgson has blown this. Big time.

Every time Phil Jagielka made a mistake in the first half, a Uruguayan player was all over him. Cavani, Suarez, Rodriguez... take your pick.  If your name is Franco Baresi or Franz Beckenbauer then you’ve earned the right to pull out the Cruyff turn on the halfway line when there isn’t a covering defender.  You don’t try that sort of stunt if you’re Phil Jagielka.

Finish: Suarez headed past Joe Hart to give Uruguay the lead in the first half

On the prowl: The Liverpool striker escaped the attention of Phil Jagielka to give Uruguay the lead

That terrifying moment was at the start of the first half and set the tone for some defending that, quite frankly, deserved to be punished.

At times they were powerless to stop the little exchanges, the knitted passes between Cavani, Suarez and Lodeiro.

That trio has the ability to pull any defence apart and England’s threatened to oblige every time the outstanding midfielder Egidio Arevalo was on the ball.

Hodgson had promised to work on England’s defensive frailties after the 2-1 defeat against Italy in the opening group game in Manaus.

In reality England’s head coach had just one full day back at their Urca training base in Rio de Janeiro to work on specific details. It’s no time at all.

Back with a bang: Suarez, who missed Uruguay's opening game, celebrates his first goal in Sao Paulo

Lifeline: Wayne Rooney tapped in Glen Johnson's cross to equalise for England

They were scared witless of Suarez, even after five weeks without a game because of the knee injury that ruled him out of Uruguay’s 3-1 defeat against Costa Rica.

He was short of match practice and high on energy, fuelled by the burning desire to score against a side with five of his Liverpool team-mates starting for England.  Those who want to move on from the John Terry and Rio Ferdinand era are well within their rights and will point to England’s defensive record in the qualifiers.

It was there, in ten games against Ukraine, Montenegro, Poland, Moldova and San Marino, that they conceded just four goals. Well bully for them.  This is the elite level, a World Cup in Brazil and we won’t be back here again in our lifetime. Mistakes are punished.

This is a tournament where several hundred million people around the world are watching each game and dissecting every aspect of every game. This is the World Cup, that’s what happens, learn to live with it.

There have been complaints that there has been too much attention, too many demands and too much expectation on the team. Please.

This is the elite level, where the best players in the world remind their countrymen watching on TV sets back in Montevideo, Salto or Paysandu just how good they are.

Heart breaker: Suarez scored his second and the winner for Uruguay with five minutes to play

Delight: The Uruguayan striker lets out a roar after scoring the decisive goal in Sao Paulo

Contrast: The South Americans celebrate in front of a dejected Rooney and Johnson

This is a World Cup group game in Brazil, boys, and the south American teams will fight to the death for the right to stay here until the bitter end.

When Suarez slips on that blue number nine shirt to play for his country after five weeks without a game, he grows as a man and scores glorious goal. Just like the two he scored here.  Some of these games are won in the tunnel or when Uruguay’s national anthem, Orientales, la Patrias o la Tumba, is belted out before kick off.

England had enough tub-thumpers in their team, with Joe Hart running over to the England supporters behind the goal just before kick off, urging them to get behind their team.

After this, they should be running for cover.
