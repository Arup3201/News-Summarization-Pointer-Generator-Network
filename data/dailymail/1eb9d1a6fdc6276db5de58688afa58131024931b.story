It was a mainstay of family motoring for the UK’s striving middle classes in the sixties and seventies.

Now, 50 years after the launch of the original, Britain’s much-loved Vauxhall Viva is to be revived.

The economical new Vauxhall will cost under £7,000 and will manage up to 70mpg.

After 50 years since it was first introduced, the Vauxhall Viva is making a comeback and will be available from next spring

Costing £6,000 and available with bluetooth and iPhone connections, it is a far-cry from its 70s namesake

Details of the Viva revival as a sharply styled small hatchback are revealed in the latest edition of motoring magazine Auto Express.

The original Viva was launched in June 1964 with the first ‘HA’ model with a 1.0 litre engine coming off the Vauxhall production line at Ellesmere Port in Cheshire.

Many teenagers of the era learned to drive in the popular cars, which were a middle-class family favourite.

Such is its understated but enduring charm, the car has even  been mentioned in an Elvis Costello song.

The last time the Viva name was seen was in 1979 on a small family saloon car – a forerunner to today’s Astra - after a 15 year run during which 1.5million Vivas were sold.

The slightly larger, re-styled and re-worked  second generation ‘HB’ Viva was unveiled in 1966 for a four-year run before being overtaken by the ‘HC’ which ran until the Viva’s demise in 1979, to be replaced by the Astra.

The 'HC' model Viva was built at Vauxhall's Ellesmere Port factory in Cheshire from 1970 to 1979 costing from £783

After a 35 year gap bosses at the UK car-maker have decided the time is right for a return in its UK heartland.

In 2004 the Viva name was briefly used on a car created Vauxhall’s parent company General Motors for Russia.

But this will be the first time  since 1979 that it will be used in its home market of Britain.

The new Viva is set to go on sale next Spring after being unveiled officially at the Geneva Motor Show in March.

It will cost £6,995 designed to  take on small rivals such as the Ford Ka, Hyundai i10, plus the Volkswagen up!, Skoda Citigo and SEAT Mii.

The new city hatchback will only be called ‘Viva’ in the UK – marking the first time in more than 20 years that Vauxhall and Opel, its German-based General Motors sibling, will use different names for a car in the UK and mainland Europe.

Auto Express editor-in-chief Steve Fowler said: ‘It’s great that a cherished British name is being revived.

'Many people will remember being driven as children in a Viva on family outings, or even learning to drive in one.

Viva became a middle-class favourite and will be remembered by many as they car they learned to drive in

The optional extras on the 1970s model included three or four doors and did just 30 to 37 mpg

'Vivas were a solid, unflashy but popular and practical family car which many remember fondly.’

Sadly, the new generation five-door Viva city car will not be built like the original at Ellesmere Port,  but in Korea. It will share the underpinnings of the next generation Chevrolet Spark.

But insiders say GM’s European design team, led by Briton  Mark Adams, has worked hard to give the car its own unique look.

There’ll be five doors and easy access, while dynamically the new model is said by Vauxhall insiders to focus more on comfort and refinement than sporty handling.

Auto Express’s Mr Fowler said: ’Expect some typical Vauxhall design cues. There’ ll be swept-back headlamps with distinctive LED daytime running lights, a large Vauxhall badge sitting on large chrome wings on the grille.’

‘Space will be key to the new Viva’s appeal. To keep the costs down There won’t be the huge array of options seen on other small cars.

'But inside  different finishes have been used on the plastics to give a more stylish, premium look.’

There will be some modern must-have technology on board – such as  Bluetooth and -  iPod connectivity - but potential buyers are warned not to expect the cutting-edge infotainment systems which would simply make the car too costly.

To keep running costs and emissions  low, the  new car is expected to be powered by  Vauxhall’s latest family of small, economical engines  such as the new three-cylinder, 1.0-litre engine.

Vauxhall is aiming to keep emissions – on which road tax is based- to under 100g/km which would mean an average fuel economy of around 70mpg.

An all-new, British-built Vauxhall Astra set to be unveiled at next year’s Frankfurt Motor Show.
