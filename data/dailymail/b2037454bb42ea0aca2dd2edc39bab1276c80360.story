Alan Pardew's future as Newcastle United manager appears to be hanging by a thread after he refused to speak to the written press following his side's embarrassing 4-0 defeat against Southampton.

Magpies owner Mike Ashley watched from the stands as Newcastle were thoroughly out-played from the very first minute by Saints - meaning they have won just one of their last 12 Premier League matches.

Travelling Newcastle fans unveiled banners with the messages 'Pardew out' and 'Pardew is a muppet' as goals from Jack Cork, Morgan Schneiderlin and a brace from Graziano Pelle condemned Newcastle to defeat.

Speaking on Sky Sports News having refused to attend his press conference, Pardew said: '‘The early goals put us on the back foot. We made individual mistakes that we couldn’t absorb. We have to take that as a team.

‘We had a great chance at 2-0 and half a chance after that. We have played OK at the start of the season and really got caught out today.

‘We didn’t have long to prepare after the internationals but there’s no excuse really. The players tried everything at 2-0. We just caught at the start.'

Pardew's men have yet to win a match this season and have slipped to the bottom of the Premier League table on goal difference having conceded seven goals in their last two matches.

And when asked if the supporters' calls for him to be removed were fair, Pardew responded: ‘The criticism from the fans is fair. You can’t get beaten 4-0 as Newcastle manager - I’ve had a few of those at the club. It’s not easy to digest but it isn’t easy for the players who have to play in these circumstances.

‘We have to be strong and tough it out. We have to put ourselves on the line and be brave. We have more quality than we showed today.’

Newcastle face Hull City at St James' Park on Saturday in what must be viewed as a must-win game, whether Pardew remains in charge or not.
