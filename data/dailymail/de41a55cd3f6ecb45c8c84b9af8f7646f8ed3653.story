Brigadier General Tadeusz Sawicz, who has died at the age of 97, is believed to have been the last surviving Polish pilot from the Battle of Britain

A World War Two airman, believed to be the last surviving Polish pilot from the Battle of Britain, has died at the age of 97.

Brigadier General Tadeusz Sawicz, credited with shooting down three German aircraft and much decorated for his valour, died on October 19 at a nursing home in Toronto, Canada.

He is believed to be the last surviving pilot from the Polish Air Forces in Britain during World War Two. He fought in the 1940 Battle of Britain and served with the RAF  until early 1947.

A spokesman for the RAF paid tribute, saying: 'There
is widespread admiration for the major contribution that the Polish 
aircrew made to the Allied victory in World War Two and their commitment 
in the face of significant losses, especially those who so bravely 
fought in the Battle of Britain.

'Their vital contributions will be long 
remembered.'

Historian
Adam Zamoyski — author of 'The Forgotten Few: The Polish Air Force in 
the Second World War' — told reporters that if Sawicz were the last 
surviving Polish pilot from the 1940 battle it would bring an important chapter to a close.

However he cautioned that there is no exact record of the pilots, who scattered around the world after the war.

Sawicz moved to Canada in 1957
and worked there in aviation.

When war broke out in 1939 Sawicz fought in Poland's air defence against the invading Germans.
At one point, he flew under German fire to carry orders to troops 
defending Warsaw.

Following the German invasion of Poland, many Polish pilots - a great number of whom had fought the Luftwaffe -  escaped and made their way to France and Britain.

In June 1940 the Polish Government in Exile formed a Polish Air Force in the UK, with two 
fighter squadrons - 302 and 303 - composed of Polish pilots and ground crews, with British 
commanding officers.

The two fighter squadrons went into 
action in August.

Most of the Polish pilots had 
hundreds of hours of pre-war flying experience and were among the most 
experienced in the battle. They had learned from combat experience to 
fire from close range.

Between them the Polish pilots claimed 201 aircraft shot down. 303 Squadron, in which Brigadier General Tadeusz Sawicz served, claimed the highest number of kills - 126 - of all Allied squadrons in the Battle of Britain.

The Polish War Memorial on the 
outskirts of RAF Northolt was dedicated in 1948 as a commemoration of 
the Polish contribution to Allied arms.

Following
the collapse of the city's defence on September 17, he joined Polish 
pilots fighting in France.

After the surrender of Paris in July 1940 he made 
his way — along with tens of thousands of Polish airmen, soldiers and sailors —
to Britain, where they made up the largest foreign military force in the 
country.

Mr Zamoyski said that some 17,000 Poles —
pilots, mechanics and ground staff — served in the Polish air force in 
Britain at the time.

In the 
summer of 1940, General Wladyslaw Sikorski — the head of Poland's 
Government in Exile in London — signed an agreement to form a Polish Air Force in Britain.

After 
training on Hurricane fighter aircraft, Sawicz was incorporated into RAF 
Polish squadron 303 and later into squadrons 316 and 315.

On and off, he 
served as a commander of the Polish wing.

Sawicz was among the 145 Polish pilots 
who fought in the Battle of Britain, 31 of whom died in action, and is credited with shooting down 
three German aircraft.

He was awarded Poland's highest 
military 
order - the Virtuti Military medal - and was also given the 
Distinguished Flying Cross by Britain, the United States and the 
Netherlands.

Other 
foreign pilots — from New Zealand, Canada, Australia, Czechoslovakia, 
South Africa, the United States and Ireland — also flew with the RAF.

A few British pilots from the battle are still alive, but it is not known how many of the international 
aviators remain.

The 
Battle of Britain pilots became known collectively as 'The Few' after 
Winston Churchill said of them: 'Never in the field of human conflict 
was so much owed by so many to so few.'

Sawicz is survived by his wife Jadwiga.

A service is planned for him at a later date in Warsaw.
