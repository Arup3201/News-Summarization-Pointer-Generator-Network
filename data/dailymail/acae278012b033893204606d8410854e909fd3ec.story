Phone cases were once simply used to protect fragile phones, but the latest wave of cases are so smart, they can predict incoming messages.

The Lunecase uses excess energy, generated when the phone connects to a network, to 
show notifications, and can distinguish between the individual 
wavelengths created by calls and texts.

These notifications appear on the rear of the case, before the phone registers they've arrived, and means alerts can be seen when the phone is face down.

Electronic devices emit very small amounts of electromagnetic energy.

When a call is made, or a text is sent, this energy is generated as the phone connects to the nearest mobile network.

Lunecase harvests this excess energy to light up LEDs on the rear of the case.

It can distinguish between the individual wavelengths created by calls and texts, and will show the relevant icon. 

Because the case uses excess energy, it never needs charging, doesn’t use the phone’s battery, or slow down connection speeds.

Alternatively, the Lunecase Eclipse version uses flashing lights around the Apple icon to notify of incoming messages and calls.

Cases are expected to retail from $50 (£30) and go on sale in August.

Because they use excess energy, the case never needs charging, doesn’t use the phone’s battery, or slow down connection speeds.

The Ukranian developers at Concepter have already raised more than $147,100 (£87,800) via a Kickstarter campaign - three times the $50,000 (£30,000) goal.

‘We decided to transform the unused energy from the iPhone into a notification system on the back of the phone.

‘The Lunecase is the first intelligent iPhone cover. The case knows and identifies when you receive a message or a phone call before it is even displayed on the iPhone's screen.

‘[It] displays these notifications on the back of the smartphone with the help of LEDs, using the free energy that is emitted by the device, converting it from the natural iPhone's electromagnetic energy into a usable energy.’

If these latest Apple rumours are true, the technology would be similar to that seen on the Lunecase. The Lunecase (pictured) uses excess energy, generated when the phone connects to a network, to show notifications - and can distinguish between the individual wavelengths created by calls and texts

The case only works when the phone is connected to a mobile network that can receive calls and texts and is currently only available for the iPhone 5, 5C and 5S.

Future versions will be built for other devices, and will show a wider range of notifications, including email.

Meanwhile, London-based Cliq has developed an Android case that adds control buttons to the rear of the device.

Three touch-based options can be programmed to launch the camera, take photos, make a call, send a pre-written text and control music.

It is available from Kickstarter for $25 (£15) and will be shipped from August.
