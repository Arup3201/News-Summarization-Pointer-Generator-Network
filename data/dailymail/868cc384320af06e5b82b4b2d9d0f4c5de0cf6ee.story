The Pentagon has warned the Navy SEAL that shot and killed Osama Bin Laden who is set to reveal his identity in a documentary is still bound by a 'non-disclosure agreement to not discuss classified information' - and could face criminal proceedings for doing so.

On Wednesday it was revealed one of the greatest mysteries in American military history will be solved next month when Fox News airs a documentary about the SEAL Team 6 member known as 'The Shooter'.

The soldier's identity has been intensely guarded since the May 2011 raid on Bin Laden's compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan - fearing the SEAL could be targeted by al-Quada - but he has since retired and is reportedly ready to be unmasked.

However the Pentagon has now urged 'The Shooter' to 'abide by the SEAL Ethos, particularly the core tenant, ''I do not advertise the nature of my work, nor seek recognition for my actions''' and that protecting such secrets is a 'liefelong obligation'.

'As a private citizen, former or retired service members are free to speak with the media and exercise their First Amendment rights,' Navy Commander Amy Derrick-Frost, a Defense Department spokeswoman, told Business Insider.

'However, it is important for all former service members to adhere to their signed non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) when they seek to openly discuss classified or sensitive information, or make claims about their active duty operations or accomplishments.

'NDAs are voluntarily executed by service members.

'After a thorough briefing on the NDA and what each paragraph contains, the service member is aware that his/her signature signifies their understanding and intent to comply with the lifelong obligation for protecting National Defense Information.'

Crucially, Derrick-Frost told Business Insider that the military had confirmed the soldier interviewed by Fox News for the two-part broadcast The Man Who Killed Usama bin Laden' was indeed the man who killed the terrorist leader.

Killed: 9/11 mastermind Osama Bin Laden was shot dead at his Abbottabad, Pakistan, compound in May 2011. The identity of the SEAL that shot him has been a fiercely guarded since

'If in fact this individual was associated with the military unit that carried out the UBL raid, which is yet to be determined, he is still bound by his non-disclosure agreement to not discuss classified information, especially in a nationally televised interview,' Derrick-Frost said.

The documentary is set to air November 11.

Fox said this week the SEAL 'w share his story of training to be a member of America’s elite fighting force and explain his involvement in Operation Neptune Spear, the mission that killed Bin Laden'.

'The documentary will provide an extensive, first-hand account of the mission, including the unexpected crash of one of the helicopters that night and why SEAL Team 6 feared for their lives' Fox said in a press release.

It will also touch upon what was taking place inside the terrorist compound while President Obama and his cabinet watched from the White House.'

It's unclear whether the Shooter's identity will be protected, or whether he will be named and appear on camera.

Fox says he will also share what it was like to confront Bin Laden and what happened when the terrorist took his final breath. 

Also included in the special will be footage of the ceremony in which the Shooter donated the shirt he wore during the raid to the National September 11 Memorial Museum earlier this year. 

While the shooter's identity has remained a secret in the three years since Bin Laden's assassination, a few details have emerged about his life from an interview he gave to Esquire magazine last year.  

Now retired, it was revealed the special-forces solider has suffered a breakdown in his marriage and is so concerned about being identified that he refused to meet families of 9/11 victims to preserve his anonymity, said the New York Post. 

Hearts in mouth: President Obama, with Secretary of State Hilary Clinton and vice president Joe Biden, watched the raid unfold in front of their eyes back in Washington D.C.

In an interview with Esquire magazine in February 2013, the shooter described in extraordinary detail the heart-stopping two minutes that changed the course of history.

In the Esquire interview The Shooter reveals that once they were given their mission, the female CIA agent - portrayed by Jessica Chastain's Maya in Zero Dark Thirty - told the team that bin Laden was '100 per cent on the third floor' of his compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan.

'We got him,' she told us. 'This is him. This is my life's work. I'm positive.'

Once he locked eyes on his target, the SEAL remembers being surprised at his appearance. Bin Laden was much taller than he expected him to be - taller than any of their guys, and skinny with a short beard and shaved head.

He was holding his wife Amal in front of him as a shield and though The Shooter could see exactly what was going on through night vision goggles, bin Laden was in total darkness and could hear but not see.  

He also said he feared she might try to blow them up. He added: ‘I don’t know if she’s got a vest and she’s being pushed to martyr them both.

'I'm just looking at him from right here [he moves his hand out from his face about ten inches]. He's got a gun on a shelf right there, the short AK he's famous for. And he's moving forward. I don't know if she's got a vest and she's being pushed to martyr them both. He's got a gun within reach. He's a threat. I need to get a head shot so he won't have a chance to clack himself off [blow himself up].

'In that second, I shot him, two times in the forehead. Bap! Bap! The second time as he's going down. He crumpled onto the floor in front of his bed and I hit him again, Bap! Same place.

'That time I used my EOTech red-dot holo sight. He was dead. Not moving. His tongue was out. I watched him take his last breaths, just a reflex breath.

'And I remember as I watched him breathe out the last part of air, I thought: Is this the best thing I've ever done, or the worst thing I've ever done? This is real and that's him. Holy sh**.

'His forehead was gruesome. It was split open in the shape of a V. I could see his brains spilling out over his face.'

The Shooter also says that the night before the raid, all the members of Team Six wrote letters to their loved ones - fully believing they would die in the mission to take down bin Laden.

He described how he sat on his bed writing a letter to his kids to be delivered on the case of his death, 'something for them to read when they are 35'. 

Earlier this week, the former Navy SEAL who wrote an inside account about the mission that killed Osama bin Laden is facing a criminal investigation for revealing classified information, reports claim.

Matthew Bissonnette controversially released No Easy Day in 2012 without approval from the Department of Defense, selling thousands of copies worldwide before it was even published.

Now, as he prepares to publish a sequel, his lawyer has revealed a vast proportion of the profits could be soaked up by extensive fines leveled by the Pentagon.
