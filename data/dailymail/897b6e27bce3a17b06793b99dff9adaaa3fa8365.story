Relief around the Etihad quickly gave way to realisation that Manchester City have fallen seven points behind Chelsea. The Premier League champions narrowly avoided a third straight home defeat, but this will go down as a serious stumble in the title race.

Manuel Pelllegrini’s side have now failed to win in their last five games here, including those setbacks in the league and cup to Arsenal and Middlesbrough.

It could have been worse had James Milner not curled a magnificent 25-yard freekick around Hull’s defensive wall deep into injury-time to deny the relegation strugglers their first away win over City in 85 years.

Even Milner couldn’t be fooled into thinking this was a good result, however.

‘Chelsea have a big lead now,’ he admitted. ‘It wasn’t good enough. We knew it would be tough against a spirited side but we’ve slipped up at home again.

‘Over 90 minutes we didn’t do what we should have done, and we need to re-group and come back again.

‘You look at our success in recent seasons and it was built on solid home form. It shows we now need to make up the ground away from home.’

Despite City’s wealth of options – their bench alone cost £130million compared to the £21.5m it took to build Hull’s entire starting line-up – they once again struggled to unlock a team who defended stubbornly.

Pellegrini recalled Samir Nasri and Edin Dzeko but to little effect. They clearly miss Yaya Toure whose absence at the Africa Cup of Nations has coincided with the recent slump.

It needed Milner, a 66th-minute replacement for Dzeko, to break Hull’s resistance after Tom Huddlestone had fouled Aguero.

The England midfielder will be out of contract in the summer and there is no guarantee that he will sign a new one. On the evidence of his strike, City should step up their efforts as soon as possible.

Pellegrini said: ‘In 24 games, James Milner has started 20 of them. I needed to make changes because in the last two games we didn’t score one goal here against Arsenal or Middlesbrough.

‘He scored a beautiful goal from a freekick. But it’s not about Milner or Yaya, we must be a creative team again. Once again we couldn’t create space against a team with 10 players behind the ball.

‘Before the game if you’d said we were going to draw against Hull I wouldn’t have liked it. But the way we did it was not so bad with a goal in the last minute.’

Hull had lost 10 of their last 14 league games but it was clear from the start that Steve Bruce’s side were not going to lie down, and they should have gone ahead in the 16th minute when Ahmed Elmohamady headed against the underside of the bar from Robbie Brady’s cross.

Joe Hart and Martin Demichelis had already got themselves into a muddle, taking it in in turns to hack the ball to safety with very little success, when another breakdown in communication proved even more costly in the 35th minute.

Hart was on his way out of goal when Demichelis stepped in and played a poor clearance straight to Jake Livemore. The Hull midfielder’s shot was saved by Hart and ran loose to Gaston Ramirez. Pablo Zabaleta put in a challenge on Ramirez but the ball ricocheted off the Hull player against the post, and rolled to David Meyler to tuck home.

It was a dog’s dinner of a goal and one that summed up City’s lamentable performance in the first half. Amazingly, it was also the 10th time in 24 league games this season that they have gone behind.

They stepped up a gear after half-time and Dzeko forced Allan McGregor into a rare save when he met Pablo Zabaleta’s cross with a first-time shot.

City thought they should have had a penalty moments later, and with some justification when Alex Bruce barrelled into the back of David Silva, but referee Jon Moss waved away their appeals.

It looked as though even a point would be beyond them when Aguero controlled Nasri’s cross to the back post in the 90th minute and hammered a shot against the underside of the bar. Then up stepped Milner.

Pellegrini knows he has work to do – and fast – to stop Chelsea disappearing into the distance.

‘You are not seeing a team with doubt,’ said the City boss. 

‘The team is running, the team has spirit, the team has possession of the ball. We work and try.

‘I would be more angry or disappointed if we didn’t run or we seemed like a tired team or don’t have ideas. I don’t think it’s that.

‘It’s more important to work with them than be angry because creative players like Nasri, Silva, Aguero, Edin or Jovetic will return to their normal performance.'
