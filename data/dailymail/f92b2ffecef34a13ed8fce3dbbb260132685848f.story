It looks like an alien mothership - but it could be London's new airport.

That's according to a major global architecture firm who have unveiled their vision  for a 'Boris Island' airport in the Thames Estuary.

The London Britannia Airport, designed by architects Gensler, includes four floating runways tethered to the sea bed.

Gensler says new runways could be floated in as required - allowing for future expansion to accommodate six landing strips.

Passengers would check in and arrive at terminals on the land.

Two would be located to the north and
south of the estuary and a third central London terminal is proposed 
between Canary Wharf and the Olympic Park.

The Evening Standard reported today that London 
Mayor Boris Johnson, who in the past backed proposals for a Thames 
island airport, dubbed 'Boris Island', has seen the Gensler proposal.

A spokesman for the Mayor said: 'This
will form, along with other significant submissions, an important part 
of discussions going forward.'

Where the proposed floating airport island would be placed, in the Thames Estuary off the coast of Kent

Heathrow Airport would close under the scheme and become a new eco-city and 'the largest urban expansion project in Europe', with housing for around 300,000 people

Expansion: Debate has raged for years over a third runway at Heathrow

The airport would be connected to London by high-speed rail.

Gensler has built airports all over 
the world and unveiled the plans in a bid to be considered as the 
designers for any future airport project. 

Ian Mulcahey, project director, said: 'Because this airport is floating it could be positioned 
in an optimal location after you evaluate flight paths, bird migrations 
and all the rest of the issues in the estuary. There's a lot of 
flexibility.'

Boris Johnson was pictured doing his best to keep the Olympic spirit alive by going for an early morning run

Mr Mulcahey added: 'It absolutely 
could be done. It's all fairly standard technology and marine 
engineering is what we're good at in Britain.

'The idea of floating runways is 
fairly basic stuff - we're just proposing it on a scale, perhaps, that 
has never been done before.

'We're locked in a political debate 
about whether to build a little runway extension [at Heathrow] or 
whether we build a proper airport.

'This could be an airport for the next 100 years.'

The Gensler scheme would see Heathrow 
Airport close and become a new eco-city and 'the largest urban expansion
project in Europe', with housing for around 300,000 people.

However, the Government has said there will be no firm decisions on UK airport expansion before the next general election.

Ministers have come under intense 
pressure from business to approve a third runway at Heathrow, Britain's 
only international hub airport, but the issue has led to bitter in-fighting within the Tory party.

Some Tories are calling for a 
U-turn, with former minister Tim Yeo saying the issue was a test of 
whether the Prime Minister is a 'man or a mouse'.

The Chancellor George Osborne, who is in charge of election
policy for the Tories, has also opened the door for the Conservatives to complete a U-turn on the third runway issue.

But Mr Johnson said it would be a 'disaster' while the MP for Richmond Park and North Kingston Zac Goldsmith warned he 
would stand down at the next election if his party does not block expanding Britain's biggest airport.

A decision on whether to support any of the recommendations in an independent 
commission’s final report will be taken after 2015, new 
Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin said last week.

Mr McLoughlin said: 'This is a very difficult debate, but the reality is
that since the 1960s Britain has failed to keep pace with our 
international competitors in addressing long-term aviation capacity and 
connectivity needs.'

He went on: 'The Government believes that maintaining the UK’s status as
a leading global aviation hub is fundamental to our long-term 
international competitiveness.

'But the Government is also mindful of the need to take full account of 
the social, environmental and other impacts of any expansion in airport 
capacity.'
