The owner of a historic World War II artillery canon has agreed to pay for the damage caused after an artillery shell fired at the Oklahoma Full Auto Shoot and Trade Show hit a house three miles away.

Homeowner Gene Kelley of Wyandotte and his wife were home when the shell entered from an outside wall, hit the ceiling and then damaged another wall.

Fortunately no one was hunt and Kelley found the 105 howitzer artillery shell, 14 and a half inches long and 3 and a half inches across, lying on his bedroom floor last Saturday.

The impact would have been a lot more severe had the shell not first hit a tree and then the ground, he said.

The owner of the gun range where the weapon was fired has described the incident as a ‘freak accident’ and said safety precautions had been followed correctly.

‘It was not on a level plane, but on a downward trend, pointed downhill in the bottom of a valley,’ Mike Friend, the owner of Fast Machine Gun Shoot, told KOAM7. 

‘It’s a freak accident, because as far as the safety end of everything, we drill every one of our shooters before it ever begins. We have 30-to-45-minute drills,' he said.

The gun owner has agreed to pay for the damage caused, but Kelley questions whether such weapons should be legal to use.

‘The people that bring these type of weapons need to think about whether it is really safe and an appropriate area to take a weapon of that magnitude and shoot it,’ he said.
