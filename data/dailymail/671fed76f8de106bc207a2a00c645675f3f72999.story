Sprightly Albert Keates is still plugging leaks as Britain's oldest plumber, 65 years and 68,000 faulty taps after his first job.

The 80-year-old, from Southampton, earned just three pence an hour in his first job in 1946, working as an apprentice on new-build houses.

But now after clocking up over six decades in his trade, the married father-of-two charges Â£42 an hour plus VAT for his years of experience at his own firm.

Going strong: Albert Keates, 80, started plumbing aged 15 and has since clocked up 68,000 fixed leaky taps

Albert worked for several companies in his home city of Southampton before setting up on his own in July 1967.

At his peak, he employed seven other plumbers.

He has out-lived many customers and has some who have been with him since his very first day in business.

Albert, who is also a qualified electrician, said: 'I secured a plumbing apprenticeship after leaving school aged 15 and have been in the trade ever since.

'I don't know anybody who has been doing it longer.

'I have turned my hand to all aspects of plumbing in that time and see it as an art form. I want to be proud of every job I do.

Long-serving: Albert said he could carry on plumbing for ever because of his love of the job and the people he meets

'Things have changed a lot over the years. It used to be a craft but it has now become a science because technology has taken over.

'When I started out, tips and tricks were passed down from master to apprentice - but now it has been formalised by colleges and redtape.'

He added: 'Four generations of the same family have employed my services as a plumber at one shop in Southampton.

'And I have out-lived many other friends and customers.

'Plumbing is an incredibly sociable job and I could carry on doing it forever because I love the trade and the people.'

However, Alfred will retire in March to become a carer for his 74-year-old wife April, whose health is deteriorating.
