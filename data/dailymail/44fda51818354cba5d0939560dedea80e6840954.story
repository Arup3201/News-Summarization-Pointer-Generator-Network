Hopes for a better new year for the 1.3 million Americans out of work were crushed today as federal unemployment benefits expired.

With Congress in recess, no last-minute fix is possible meaning that those who have already dipped into savings and made other cutbacks will be left struggling to provide for their families.

Perhaps surprisingly, many of those affected will be middle class workers who had previously earnedÂ  up to $70,000 a year until the recession hit.

About 40 per cent of Americans who received long-term unemployment benefits since 2008 had been earning $30,000 to $75,000 before losing their jobs, according to the White House Council of Economic Advisers.

Previous research by the Congressional Budget Office showed more than two thirds of recipients had incomes more than twice the poverty level, the Huffington Post reported.

The figures show that the unemployment insurance, first offered by President George W Bush to provide a safety net for those hit by the recession, is mainly serving the middle class.

A further problem for some of the job seekers receiving the benefits is that a steady career in a professional field, and advanced age, has limited their ability to find new work.

One such person is David Torian, an Ivy-League educated lawyer with 23 years' congressional experience who lost his job in 2012.

'I get interviews but lose out in the
 end because prospective employers tell me my experience makes me "over-qualified" and they do not feel I would stay long in the position 
if it was offered,' Mr Torian told The Huffington Post.

For just over a year the 49-year-old has been receiving the unemployment benefit - about $430 a week. But that came to an end on Wednesday.

Mr Torian has already made cutbacks, moving to a cheaper home and spending his savings and 401(k) accounts.

He said he can afford to pay rent for the next three months but if he can't find work by then he is not sure what will happen.

'I'm in an out of depression mode,' he said, adding that he had looked at blue collar work but lacks the background or skills needed for that.

When Congress returns on January 6, President Obama and the Democrats are expected to push to have the benefits renewed.

The benefits are an extension for the unemployed once their state jobless benefits expire - which in many states happens after 26 weeks.

Republicans are expected to try to block attempts to renew the benefits, but Democrats have been gaining momentum for their push by highlighting personal stories of some of those about to be cut off.

They have also seized on a comment made by Republican Rand Paul who said extended the benefits would be a 'disservice' and give those out of work less of an incentive to find jobs quickly.

Push: President Obama, pictured in the White House before the holidays, wants the benefit program to be reinstated

Mr Paul's comments hit a nerve with Bruce Hirshfield, who lost his job and six-figure salary when the bank he was vice-president of was restructured.

'My motivation is not about getting unemployment benefits. My motivation is to get back to where I was,' the father-of-three said.

'I understand what [Rand Paul] is saying, but he is dead wrong.'

After losing his job, Mr Hirshfield took a course in project management to add to his professional skills, and extended the area in which he is looking for work.

But the 54-year-old has now been unemployed for 14 months, and has been forced to turn to his savings and pension to provide for his family.

His experiences echo those of tens of thousands of other Americans who have been striving to get back into work, and who will now struggle now the benefit has been cut.

Temporary measures to help are being discussed, but with Congress away until January 6 no immediate relief will be available.

President Obama has taken time out over the holidays to speak with Democrat Jack Reed and Republican Dean Heller, who are sponsoring a measure to temporarily extend the benefits.

'As the president has repeatedly made clear, it defies economic sense, precedent and our values to allow 1.3 million Americans fighting to find jobs to see their unemployment insurance abruptly cut off,' Gene Sperling, of the White House National Economic Council, said.
