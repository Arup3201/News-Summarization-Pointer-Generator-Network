NHS boob job scrounger Josie Cunningham has been given a new council house double the size of her old one after claiming she was terrified of Twitter trolls tracking her down.

The scrounger, branded 'Britain's most hated woman' by her own mother, has swapped a poky two-bedroom terraced home on an estate for a newly refurbished three-bed semi-detached property in a charming village 20 miles away.

Ms Cunningham, 24, told Leeds Council to move her because she was worried about Twitter death threats - but admitted to a friend her cramped accommodation no longer 'suited her image', The Mirror reports.

Up-sizing: NHS boob job scrounger Josie Cunningham has been given a new council house

A source told the newspaper: 'She knew what she wanted so she went and got it. When she started to get Twitter threats she saw an opportunity. In private she says the trolls don't bother her.

'Josie rang me up laughing when the deal for her new home came off and said "you couldn't swing a cat in the old place. I could swing a tiger in here – wait till you see it".

'She's obviously not short of money. She splashes out £500 a day for a bodyguard and driver when she works in London – and her children have more designer clothes than most adults.'

The mother-of-three was seen walking with a pram near her new home in West Yorkshire today - just hours after taking to Twitter to berate an unknown man for taking a photograph of her while she was upset.

She tweeted: 'Fuming. Stressful day, sat round my mums in tears and this p***k thinks it's fine to take pictures of me crying!

'The f***er only got a picture of me crying so instead of any media paying him for his photos, here's one for free!' she added, posting a close-up photo of herself looking bleary-eyed beneath heavy mascara.

The Mirror's source also claimed that Ms Cunningham insisted a £3,500 kitchen with brand new appliances be fitted in her new property - along with a £2,000 bathroom.

Four of the rooms had to be re-plastered and she even paid £1,600 out of her own pocket for new carpets.  

After first making headlines by getting a boob job on the NHS, Ms Cunningham has achieved notoriety by securing a series of government-funded luxuries such as subsidised taxi-rides worth £6,000 a year - so she doesn't have to take the bus.

She has also blurted out a string of outrageous remarks - recently deeming breastfeeding 'vile and borderline incest' while claiming she will sell her breast milk for cash. 

The fame-obsessed model shocked the nation in April when she said she was considering aborting her baby at 18 weeks for the chance to appear on Channel 5's Big Brother. 

Despite changing her mind and giving birth to Grace seven weeks ago, she has continued to shock the public with her actions.

She also caused outrage by tweeting during the two-minute Armistice Day silence that she wanted to 'scream and shout'.

Ms Cunningham has landed numerous magazine deals and runs her own dating website - yet she claims she still cannot afford to rent a private home for her family.

The unemployed wannabe-model, who fell pregnant with her third child after a stint as a £1,000-a-night hooker, is still unsure who the father is of her third child, Grace. 

A Leeds City Council spokesman said: 'While we do not comment on individual cases, the allocation of social housing by Leeds City Council is undertaken as set out in our waiting list criteria.'
