They're called 'snapping' turtles for a very good reason, but this hapless animal lover just had to find out the hard way and ended up in hospital.

The Chinese man was reportedly releasing the ferocious-looking creature into the wild but decided he had to give it a goodbye kiss first.

Unfortunately the love was not exactly requited and the snapping turtle did what snapping turtles do and snapped him on the lip.

The clue's in the name: A hapless Fujian animal lover decided to give a snapping turtle a goodbye kiss before releasing it into the wild

The man, from Fujian province, was left with the turtle dangling from his face refusing to release its powerful, pincer-like jaws.

Eventually the animal was prized away from the unfortunate man who was immediately rushed to hospital.

A friend then posted the picture on the internet to warn people of the dangers of kissing snapping turtles.

According to the the Shanghai Daily the animal appeared to be an alligator snapping turtle which are native to North America and known to be highly dangerous.

They are the largest freshwater turtles in the world and can grow to more than half-a-metre in length and live to be 160 years old.

But they are most known for their powerful jaws which are strong enough to bite through a broomstick handle.
