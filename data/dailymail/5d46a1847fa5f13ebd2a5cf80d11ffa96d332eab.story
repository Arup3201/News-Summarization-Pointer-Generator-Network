The 32-year-old Macklin was on top in the first two rounds but the freshness and intensity of his opponent, who has never been stopped, was too much for him to handle 

'It was an accurate shot that put me down but it wasn't that heavy. I had been tired for two or three rounds before that, truth be told,' Macklin said.

'Maybe I burned up a little too much energy early on, maybe I'm getting old.

'I'll have to see where I go from here.'
