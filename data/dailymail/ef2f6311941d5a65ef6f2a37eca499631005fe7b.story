The mother of Prue Bird who disappeared more than twenty years ago when she was 13 has spoken of the moment she realised her daughter was missing.

Jenny Bird said she had felt uneasy throughout the day on February 2, 1992, but had tried to 'pushing' it away.

Ms Bird finally received some closure when Leslie Camilleri - who is known as the Bega schoolgirl killer - was sentenced for 28 years in 2013 for her murder.

Jenny Bird has spoken out about the moment she realised her daughter, Prue, was missing from their Melbourne home

Camilleri has maintained her acted alone and Prue's body has never been found.

On Monday night, Ms Bird told Australian Story about the fear she felt when her daughter disappeared and how she was still convinced her murder had ties with the 1986 Russell Street bombing that killed a Melbourne police woman.

Prue's story is covered in a two-part series airing on the ABC.

Ms Bird said she remembered everything that happened on February 2.

Prue Bird, 13, went missing on February 2, 1992, and her killer was convicted of murder in 2013

The mother had just come home from the local pool when she noticed her daughter had left her meal of creamed corn untouched on the coffee table inside their Glenroy home - north of Melbourne.

'No note in the kitchen and as all as a bugger Prue was, we did leave notes,' Ms Bird said.

'All her clothes were still there, all the money was still there like her pocket money and stuff.'

Ms Bird's first port of call was contacting Prue's friend to see if she was hanging out with them, but when she was told this was not the case, panic started up.

'I just knew from that moment - "Oh my God, my little girl is in trouble somewhere", she said.

Despite her daughter's killer being behind bars, Ms Bird is still convinced Prue's disappearance was tied to the 1982 Russell Street bombing.

Ms Bird's mother Julie Hetzel met Paul Hetzel while he was serving time in prison for armed robbery and attempted murder.

Paul Hetzel was associated with men convicted of the bombing - Craig 'Fatty' Minogue, Stan Taylor and Peter Reed - and Rodney Minogue who was acquitted of the crime.

Ms Hetzel claims Mr Minogue made threats against her granddaughter's safety if she or her husband went to the police with information about their involvement in bombing.

Prue's psychiatrist also reveals 13-year-old told of a car that was following her in the days leading up to her disappearance.

'In the last one or two visits Prue had stated to one of my colleagues that she had been followed by a car two or three times and it was the same car and it was in the street near her home,' Dr Helen Driscoll said.

'I talked to Prue about it also and the concern was is she imagining things, is her mental state all right? She wasn't, her mental state was fine... and that was the last session that I saw Prue alive.'
