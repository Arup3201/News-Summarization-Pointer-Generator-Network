West Ham United have complained to the Barclays Premier League alleging Fulham have 'tapped up' Ravel Morrison.

Club officials are believed to be unhappy about comments made by Fulham manager Rene Meulensteen over Morrison's proposed move to Fulham.

Meulensteen admitted West Ham have already rejected a bid from Fulham to buy the former Manchester United youngster and claimed Morrison was keen to move to Craven Cottage.

West Ham want near £10million for the talented 20-year-old but Fulham are believed to have offered £7.5m for both Morrison and team-mate Mohamed Diame.

Meulensteen worked with Morrison at 
United and suggested an improved bid would be submitted, with
 the youngster keen to make the switch across London.

And the Dutchman's remarks over a prospective transfer have irked the east-London club enough for them to lodge a complaint with the League.

‘We got knocked back,’ he said after Fulham's 3-0 win FA Cup win over Norwich on Tuesday evening. ‘We 
need to review it and move on. I left it with (chief executive) Alistair
 Mackintosh. I’ve explained what I think about the situation so we’ll 
have to see what happens.

‘I
 make my desires clear then leave it to those people to deal with it. We
 will review it because I don’t know exactly the ins and outs of how 
it’s been rejected.

‘(Morrison offers) youthfulness, energy, unpredictability, strength. Loads of things.’

Meulensteen
 said he hoped a deal for Morrison could be concluded this window but added: ‘We all 
know it’s very difficult in the January transfer window. Why would clubs do 
business early? They know the longer they wait the higher the price 
goes.’

When asked 
whether Morrison would want to join Fulham, the Dutch boss replied: 'I 
have known him a long time. Yes. He does want to come here.'

Sportsmail understands West Ham are hoping for swift and decisive action from the Premier League over the alleged misconduct.

On Wednesday morning Fulham had little to add to Meulensteen's comments.

A club 
spokeswoman said: ‘When asked the question regarding the 
player Ravel Morrison in last night’s press conference, Rene Meulensteen answered honestly, that a bid had 
been made to West Ham United for the player and that the bid had been 
rejected.’

Morrison has 18 
months left on his current £15,000-per-week deal at Upton Park and 
negotiations to extend his contract have broken down.

It has been revealed a clause in his contract stipulates his wages at Upton Park must quadruple to £60,000 per week if a club offers £10m, Rene Meulensteen is understood to want to use his personal connection with Morrison to help engineer a switch to Craven Cottage.

While the Cottagers are obviously keen on bringing Ravel in from the fellow relegation strugglers, Sam Allardyce insisted they would do everything to keep him at the club, as well as dismissing reports of a transfer request from the youngster.

'There's no truth in that [transfer request],' Allardyce said last week. 'But I'm not surprised there's another rumour about Ravel Morrison.'

He added: 'We haven't had any discussions about Ravel Morrison being sold by this club.'

Morrison is West Ham's top scorer this season with five goals.
