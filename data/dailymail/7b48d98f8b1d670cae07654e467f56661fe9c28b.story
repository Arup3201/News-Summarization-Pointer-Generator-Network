Prince
Harry’s debauched weekend in Las Vegas cost £30,000, but his hotel bill
was waived as he breezed out of the opulent Encore Wynn resort.

Billionaire
Steve Wynn, who owns the hotel and five casinos, ordered that the royal
party would not have to pay for anything, sources said.

Harry and his two travelling friends were shown to their palatial eight-room suite when they arrived last Friday afternoon.

The 
biggest and most luxurious of the hotel’s 16 duplexes, it has three 
master bedrooms, one for Harry and one each for his friends. It also has
its own private lift, butler service, a room with a massage table and 
gym equipment and, of course, a pool table.

It is understood his protection officers were staying in a nearby suite.

A
hotel source said: ‘There is no way Harry was presented with a bill on 
his way out. That’s not Steve’s style. When Prince Harry is in Vegas, he
stays at the Wynn.’

A
member of staff said Harry’s guest account was locked and only senior 
executives with a password could access the details of his bill, but 
added: ‘I think we’re talking about it running to more than a couple of 
pages.’

It seems Harry and Co certainly took full advantage of the generosity.

Their
£5,100 a night suite – Room 2401 on the 63rd floor of the five-star 
Wynn Encore Hotel – also boasts a steam shower, 72in TV, chandeliers and
a wet bar.

After checking in through a private lobby, Harry and his friends went to the SW Steakhouse to eat.The
restaurant faces on to a waterfall inhabited by a giant psychedelic 
animated frog, and Harry has eaten there before in November 2011 with Mr
Wynn.

With a champagne and wine list boasting bottles costing thousands of dollars, the steakhouse is renowned for its cuisine.

The cost of dinner would have been signed on to the hotel room bill.

Afterwards,
the party moved to the hotel’s Surrender nightclub, which is set around
an outdoor pool. Here, the prince and his friends supped $15 (£9.50) 
jaegerbomb cocktails and $10 (£6) beers as go-go dancers in skimpy 
bikinis gyrated around stripper poles. They also played the dice game 
craps at the hotel’s casino.

On
Saturday, the party took a £1,000-a-day VIP bungalow at the MGM Grand 
Hotel for one of its Wet Republic pool parties, before returning to 
their suite at the Wynn.

Sunday
was spent around the Encore Wynn’s Beach Club pool, where more alcohol 
and bar snacks were consumed. The prince rounded off the night at the 
resort’s XS nightclub, where all drinks can be signed up to the room 
account.

It
is unclear who paid for the rooms used by the protection officers, but a
source at the hotel suggested no one in the royal party was asked to 
pay anything.

By the end of their three-day stay, it is estimated the total bill would have been in excess of £30,000.

A
source said: ‘Steve Wynn is very generous and he knows it is good 
business too. Any A-list celebrity would get the same treatment.’

Before
his Las Vegas jaunt, Harry was a guest of Sir Richard Branson and his 
son Sam at their private Necker island in the Caribbean, and after 
Vegas, Harry stayed at a friend’s house in Malibu, before flying home to
Britain.

Yesterday a spokesman for Mr Wynn said: ‘We would never comment on our guests.’
