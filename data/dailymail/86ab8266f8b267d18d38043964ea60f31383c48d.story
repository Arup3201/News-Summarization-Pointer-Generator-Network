A stunt-woman, who has doubled for the likes of Keira Knightley and Diane Kruger, is suing Sony after being injured on the set of the Emmy-winning FX show, Justified, which she claims also ruined her marriage.

Lisa Hoyle, an established stunt-woman from Los Angeles who has appeared for more than 100 actresses, is suing Sony Pictures Entertainment alongside her husband, Robert Jakubik,  claiming their marriage was damaged alongside her body in the incident.

The lawsuit obtained by TMZ says Hoyle was knocked over by a car on the crime show's set in 2011 - she suffered an open head fracture and an injury to her ankle.

In the claim she is joined by her husband Jakubik who is suing Sony for causing the couple's separation which they say was a direct result of the injuries she suffered.

'As a result of the injuries to his wife, Jakubik has suffered from temporary loss of aid, love, comfort and society from his wife, Hoyle. Additionally the marital relations between Jakubik and Hoyle deteriorated resulting in a separation,' it says.

Hoyle alleges she wasn't fully warned about what would happen in the stunt she was involved in in March 2011 when a car crashed into a parked vehicle on the L.A. set.

Hoyle was knocked to the ground by the parked car.

'As a result of the impact Hoyle sustained injuries to her person including not limited to an open head fracture, soft tissue injuries, bruising and lacerations,' according to the legal documents.

The couple previously showcased their happy marriage in an article for Hitchedmag.com where Jakubik, under the name Darius, talked about life being married to a stunt-woman.

He told the magazine: 'I thought it was pretty hot. Not too many people get the opportunity to wake up every day and be stoked about going to work, and she is.'

He also told the magazine about their fears of Hoyle suffering an injury.

'You always think about that,' he added. 'I don’t think anybody could tell their spouse, ‘hey, I’m going to jump off of a 3-story building today’ and they leave the house and it doesn’t drift through your mind," he says...Luckily, she’s been pretty injury-free.'

The couple were married for more than five years and have a daughter.

Hoyle most recently appeared in True Blood and Battle Los Angeles according to her IMDB profile.

The suit was lodged on Friday in L.A.'s superior court.
