An eminent nutrition expert is urging people to spurn half-litre cans of Red Bull and other energy drinks because they contain dangerous levels of caffeine and sugar.

A 473ml can of Red Bull, costing £1.99, contains an astonishing 13 teaspoons of sugar and 150 mg of caffeine, roughly the same as four cups of instant coffee.

Biological scientist and nutrition expert Dr Hans-Peter Kubis says there is no need for such a high concentration of the substances as the potential health consequences include rapid or irregular heartbeat, 
elevated blood pressure, sleeping trouble, weight gain, muscle twitching, 
diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting - and even sudden death.

How much?: Red Bull's 473ml can (right) contains 52g of sugar, roughly the same as 13 teaspoons

Earlier this year he released the findings of a Bangor University study into what soft drinks do to our bodies.

The research shocked him so much he now 
doesn't touch soft drinks, branding them 'evil', especially when combined with booze.

He said: 'While there is good evidence 
that caffeine has positive effects on cognitive performance of people - 
we all know this from experience - there are also physiological effects.

Buzz: Caffeine is an effective stimulant, but high volumes may be dangerous, according to Dr Kubis

Dr Kubis says there is no need for such high volumes of caffeine and sugar.

He added: 'Every person has their own sensitivity for caffeine and certain younger people or people with undetected cardiovascular problems are at higher risk experiencing negative effects from caffeine.

'In fact caffeine blocks signals which are essential for a good regulation of blood pressure, heart rhythm and blood flow to muscle, kidney function and other tissues.

'The combination of high sugar and caffeine and alcohol obviously deceives the brain into the feeling of a high energy level while the rest of the body needs to cope with the negative effects of high caffeine and alcohol - sometimes leading to serious outcomes like sudden death.

'These drinks are disastrous for health. You cannot compensate for the amount of energy you're taking on.'

Dr Kubis says there is no need for a large can size of soft drinks containing caffeine and high sugar levels and people should stay away from them.

He added: 'You might think you save some money on a larger can size, but you take the risk that you ingest large amounts of caffeine in a short time with unexpected outcomes.

'Consumers have no insight into how much caffeine and sugar there is in the drink.'

Comparisons with tea or coffee are misleading because people don't drink tea and coffees quickly as they are hot, usually come in smaller quantities and don't have 51g of sugar, Dr Kubis said.

The best defence, he added, would be to increase taxes and limit advertising where children might see it, similar to alcohol and tobacco.

'The sugary taste also makes the drink appeal to children and youths who are not attracted by teas and coffees because of their bitter taste,' he added.

'The chance that a sensitive youth drinks the same 150mg caffeine from teas or coffees is extremely low, but there is a good chance that a youth drinks a second can of Red Bull.'

Dominance: Red Bull is the biggest energy drink in the world. Last year it sold 4.6bn cans of Red Bull with a turnover of £3.4bn

Red Bull cans state that the beverage has a high caffeine content and is not recommended for children, pregnant women and 'persons sensitive to caffeine'.

The company disputes the claim that the 473ml can has the same caffeine as four cups of coffee.

A spokesperson added: 'A 473 ml can of Red Bull Energy Drink contains roughly the same amount of caffeine as two cups of coffee.

'We provide these larger can sizes because many consumers have indicated to us that they would like this choice.'

Dr Kubis also believes that 
liquid sugars not only alter our bodies, but also foster addict-like 
responses.

Countries such as Denmark and France are introducing soft-drink taxes to cut consumption.

Red Bull was founded in 1984 by Austrian Dietrich Mateschitz, who became aware of popular 'tonic drinks' while in the Far East. Now Red Bull is the world's biggest energy drink, selling around 30bn cans in 164 countries since 1987.
