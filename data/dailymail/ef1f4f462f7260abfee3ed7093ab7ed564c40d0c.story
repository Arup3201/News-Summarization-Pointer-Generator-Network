A ten-year-old boy head-butted a teacher unconscious and kicked her assistant so hard he broke her leg, a court heard yesterday.

He went on a violent rampage after the teacher confiscated a coin he had been scraping across his desk during a lesson.

CCTV captured the boy throwing a box across the room and upturning the teacher's desk. He then ran out of the design and technology lesson into the corridor where he started kicking and punching the walls.

Bromley Magistrates' Court, Kent, where the boy pleaded guilty to assault and unlawful wounding before a youth court hearing

When the two women, in their 50s, tried to restrain him, he head-butted one and kicked the other in the leg.  

The boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, sat next to his mother at Bromley Youth Court yesterday and nodded a guilty plea to a charge of assault.

When asked for a plea for unlawful wounding, he shrugged his shoulders and looked at his mother who nodded at him.

Nisha Dutt, prosecuting, said the assistant 'felt a kick to her left knee and witnesses say there was a cracking noise'.

Surgeons confirmed she had suffered a severe fracture and was likely to suffer from post-traumatic arthritis and require a knee replacement.

The teacher, who has worked at the school for 12 years, was taken to hospital with facial injuries, and diagnosed with concussion.

'The only reason he has pleaded guilty is because he did hurt (his teachers), but they caused the situation.'

Police said the boy simply said 'I'm sorry' when they arrested him at the special behavioural school in Kent, on January 5.

In a victim impact statement read to 
the court, the 53-year-old teaching assistant said the attack had deeply
affected her and left her out of work.

She said: 'I have been unable to walk 
unaided. I have gone from being an independent and active woman to 
almost immobile, being totally dependant on others and scarred for 
life.'

Daniel Cummins, defending, said the 
boy suffers from a 'broad spectrum personality disorder and behavioural 
difficulties', is  of below average intelligence  and has been under the
care of a psychologist since he was eight.

Children can be convicted of a crime 
from the age of ten, but cannot be given a custodial sentence until they
are 12 other than in exceptional circumstances.

District Judge Roger Ede sentenced the
boy to a 12-month referral order for each offence which means he and 
his mother will have to meet regularly with a youth offending team.

The boy's tearful mother told the court that she did not agree with the court's decision.

She added: 'The only reason he pleaded guilty is because he did hurt them, but they caused the situation.

'He is not a bad kid so he won't be coming back to court regardless of being on probation.'
