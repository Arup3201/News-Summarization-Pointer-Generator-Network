Svetlana Lokhova is claiming sex discrimination, harassment, victimisation, and constructive dismissal against her former employers Sberbank UK

A City trader labelled 'Crazy Miss Cokehead' was singled out for dismissal by her Russian boss after she spurned his sexual advances, an employment tribunal was told.

Svetlana Lokhova, 32, who is suing Sberbank for more than £5million, claims her boss became 'irritated' after she rejected his sexual overtures and placed her on a firing list in revenge.

And one colleague told her that the boss must have hired her 'because of her tits.'

In a statement to Central London Employment Tribunal, Miss Lokhova said she had been shocked to discover that Timur Nasardinov, who had personally head-hunted her, singled her out to be dismissed as she had turned to him for support over bullying by other male colleagues.

She said: 'On reflection, it seems to me that this may have been because, on or around December 1 2011, Timur made an inappropriate and unwanted sexual overture towards me at an after work dinner event, which I rejected.

'Having now read Timur's statement, it seems perhaps that Timur was irritated that I had rejected his advances and sought to punish me by means of placing my name on a list of people to be fired.

'This also seems to be supported by Ruben Vardanian's comment to me on January 22 2012 that Timur must have wanted "extra services" and that I must have been hired because of my "tits".'

The tribunal heard how the Russian-born Cambridge graduate was subjected to a 'sustained and vicious campaign of harassment and discrimination' for being a woman.

Male colleagues labelled her 'mad' and 'crazy' and told that she needed to have sex with Nigerian tribesmen to 'calm her down', it is claimed.

Miss Lokhova, who took home £750,000 a year in salary and bonuses, said the relentless bullying began before she even started work at the firm's London office because she had earlier blown the whistle on insider trading by a senior trader at the bank.

She had initially quit her job as head of fixed income sales in February 2010 after being told by bosses that her complaint of insider trading was 'unacceptable'.

But she was lured back to the bank's 
London-based subsidiary, Troika Dialog UK, by Timur Nasardinov, who 
guaranteed her an annual bonus of £666,000 on top of her £120,000 
salary.

But once there she 
claims she was subjected to a litany of degrading comments as part of a bid by her 
line manager David Longmuir and chief executive officer Paolo Zaniboni 
to oust her because of her whistleblowing.

Miss
Lokhova, the daughter of a shipping broker, said: 'For example, my 
manager and colleagues described me in sexist terms as "Miss Cokehead", 
"b****", "chemically dependent minigarch daughter" and "Miss Dodgy 
Septum" in communications made to senior people within Troika group and 
to clients.'

In one email her boss David Longmuir, who now accepts the drugs slurs were untrue, told a client 'we are all quaking here - awaiting arrival of Ms Cokehead in a puff of sulphurous smoke'.

Senior analyst Mikhail Stiskin allegedly wrote an email to a co-worker where he said how he 'knew a few tribe leaders in Nigeria... proper alpha male... she needs to relax after the stressful period of the past months. These guys would help'.

Miss Lokhova claims boss Paolo Zaniboni was among those who victimised her because she blew the whistle on insider dealing, which he denies

Miss Lokhova said she 'burst into tears' when she read the comments made about her.

She said: 'I believe this comment is indicative of the bank's chauvinistic culture generally, and discriminatory treatment of me.

'The references to me being mentally unstable and a drug user were particularly hurtful for me because my mother suffers from mental illness and alcoholism.

'My whole life has been dedicated to trying to rise above the destructive behaviour that had afflicted her.

'To discover the extent of the sexist comments made against me is shocking."

Six months after she started at the London office, her name was on a 'firing list' for poor performance and she started a grievance process against the bank.

She was signed off sick with stress before finally resigning in April last year.

She is suing the bank for sex discrimination, harassment, victimisation and constructive dismissal.

The bank strongly denies the allegations and claims that Miss Lokhova routinely lost her temper and lacked experience in equity sales.

A document submitted to the tribunal, Naomi Ellenbogen QC, representing Troika, states: 'Aspects of the claimant's performance, namely her ability to work effectively and harmoniously with others, were of concern to her employer and colleagues.'

It adds that Miss Lokhova had a 'rude and dismissive attitude towards colleagues, her unprofessional behaviour and her tendency to lose her temper and self control when things did not go her way'.

Spokesman Paul Marriott said 'Sberbank CIB cannot comment on the specifics of a historical matter which is subject to the judgement of an employments tribunal.  However, the company is confident that it has acted appropriately and lawfully and will vigorously defend itself against all allegations made.'

The hearing continues.
