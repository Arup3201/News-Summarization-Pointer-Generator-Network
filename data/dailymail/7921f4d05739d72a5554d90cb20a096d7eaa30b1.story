Australian Apple users are having their devices hijacked and held to ransom by sophisticated hackers.

Mac devices - including iPads, iPhones and computers - have reportedly been targeted overnight across New South Wales, Queensland, Victoria, South Australia and Western Australia.

Worried users have posted their concerns to online support communities, looking for answers to the issue that is now costing them money.

Apple users were reportedly woken in the early hours of Tuesday morning to an alert on their devices - warning them they had been hacked by Oleg Pliss.

The hacker is demanding money, before unlocking their devices.

Melbourne iPad owner 'veritylikestea' posted to an Apple support forum that her iPad 'suddenly locked itself' on Tuesday morning.

'There was a message on the screen ... saying that my device(s) had been hacked by Oleg Pliss,' she told Australian Associated Press.

The message demanded she pay US$100 (AU$108.20) through PayPal for her device to be unlocked.

Other Apple users were reportedly woken up to alert noises on their devices, with similar messages popping up.

Those who had their iPhones hacked have reported unhelpful service from major telecommunications companies and Apple.

It's unclear how the hackers gained access to the devices, but some users are pointing to a breach of their iCloud accounts.

Hackers were likely to have activated a 'lost mode' on the devices, allowing them to be locked.

IT security expert Troy Hunt told Fairfax that he believes it may have been a case of using the same password across multiple devices - meaning all of a person's accounts are vulnerable if a password is hacked.

'Regardless of how difficult someone believes a password is to guess, if it's been compromised in another service and exposed in an unencrypted fashion, then it puts every other service where it has been reused at risk. Of course it also suggests that two-factor authentication was likely not used as the password alone wouldn't have granted the attacker access to the iCloud account,' he said.

MailOnline sought comment from Apple, Optus and Telstra.
