A woman who invited Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg to her upcoming wedding was surprised to discover the justice sent her a personal letter saying she couldn't make it.

Staci Zaretsky shared the story of her declined invitation in an essay online, Jezebel noted.

'My fiancé and I decided to invite everyone who had ever made an impact on our lives, big or small,' Zaretsky wrote at Above the Law.

She later explained, 'To stay true to the way we invited all of our guests, I wanted to invite the justice who made the biggest impact on my life.'

Zaretsky wrote that she 'painstakingly sealed [the envelope] with a rhinestone heart,' and 'enclosed a handwritten note, telling Justice Ginsburg what an inspirational woman she was and praising her for what she's done for women's rights in the United States.'

She shared an image of the letter sent from the famous justice herself that she was shocked to receive on Above the Law.

'I didn’t think Justice Ginsburg would have the time to RSVP,' she wrote.

Ginsburg sent this letter to Zaretsky, saying she couldn't make it

Zaretsky wrote at Above the Law that she was overjoyed to receive the letter, and included a warning at the end of her post.

'P.S. A Supreme Court justice took the time to respond to our wedding invitation, and yet we still have 50+ outstanding RSVPs,' she said.  'I hope you have a really good excuse for keeping us waiting, friends.'

Zaretsky said in an email exchange to MailOnline that the invitation held a special place with her and her fiance.

'We didn't invite any other public figures or legal celebrities who have inspired us, and we saved one invitation specifically for Justice Ginsburg,' she said.

She said 'I decided that we would invite Justice Ginsburg because she is one of, if not the most, influential figures in women's rights law in our country's history.

'If I had to pick a single case to define her legacy, it would have to be Reed v. Reed, where the Constitution's guarantee of equal protection was held as applicable to women for the first time.'

Zaretsky also said she may contact Ginsburg in the future.

'Even though Justice Ginsburg is unable to attend our wedding, I'd happily invite her to more of the celebratory occasions in our lives. Who knows, maybe we'll be able to send her a birth announcement a few years down the line!'
