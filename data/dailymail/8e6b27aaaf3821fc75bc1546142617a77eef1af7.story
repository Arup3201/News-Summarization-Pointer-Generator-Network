Amazing slow-motion footage has emerged from South Africa of a tiger jumping to grab food in mid-air.

The animal leapt higher than the fences of its enclosure to get the meat, gracefully catching it while in flight, in the slowed down video from Boxing Day.

The filmer later wrote online: 'If you watch closely you'll see that the tiger actually jumps higher than the fence of the enclosure. Impressive animals.'

The video shows the incredible spring jump of a tiger at a South African nature reserve

It's a good job the food was thrown away from tourist leaning over the fence with his camera, as he would have been in easy reach of the bounding big cat.

The tiger leaps at least 10 feet into the air using its giant paws to snare the lump of meat in its jaws. 

After the tourist is told to get ready, he catches the tiger leaping at least 10ft into the air to grab the meat

The tigers comes to ground with the prize of a huge lump of meat, but will he share with his friend?

Despite their size and weight, tigers have a superb spring effect that helps it become one of the fiercest beasts on the earth.

The big cat, as well as jumping heights of well over 10ft, can spring vertically as far as 20ft when in full flight. 

There are a number of tiger sanctuaries in South Africa, with tourists allowed to get up close and personal to the carnivores, up to a point at least.
