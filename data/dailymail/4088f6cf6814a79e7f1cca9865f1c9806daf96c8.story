This was the scene after a brazen gang of thieves blew up a cash machine in the middle of the night.

The cashpoint outside a Costcutter shop in a Texaco petrol station in the St George area of Bristol was blown apart at around 3am this morning.

It comes just weeks after another machine was targeted in the city, leaving Â£10 notes scattered across the floor.

A cash machine in a Texaco petrol station forecourt in Bristol was blown up overnight

Police at the scene this morning. Officers say it too early to tell whether the raid is linked to a similar theft earlier this year

The explosion happened just yards from the garage's petrol pumps

John Roach, 71, who lives next to the petrol station says he was shocked thieves could set off explosives so close to large amounts of fuel.

He said: 'I was asleep at the time and heard the huge bang. It woke me up obviously and I thought it sounded like a bomb.

'Then I thought it could have been a car accident so I looked out the window. There was a motorbike revving but no accident so I went back to sleep.

'This morning I was told it was a sort of bomb. It's a bit worrying for us as we are only the second house up from the garage.'

Neighbours reported hearing a huge bang before seeing a motorbike speeding off after the 3am raid

The petrol station was closed at the time of the incident and police say no money was taken

Two canisters were left amid the mangled debris which littered the forecourt this morning

Police say the garage was closed at the time and theives did not manage to get any money out of the machine.

In April, another cash machine in the town was attacked, with thieves in that raid making off with money.

Officers say they are still investigating whether the two raids were carried out by the same people and it was 'too early' to link them.

A spokesman for the Avon and Somerset force said: 'We are investigating an attempted theft at a service station on Bell Hill Road in Bristol at around 3.10am this morning.

'On arrival at the scene, police found an ATM machine had been damaged during the incident. An investigation has begun to establish what happened.'
