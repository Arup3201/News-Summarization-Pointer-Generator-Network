Britain’s most expensive council house has been taken over by squatters – who have vowed to fight any attempts to evict them.

The Grade II-listed building in south London sold at auction for almost £3million on Monday, but its new owner now faces the prospect of getting rid of around 20 unauthorised tenants.

Within hours of going under the hammer, the new occupants could be seen hanging protest banners from the windows of the five-storey property in Southwark.

Anger: One of the demonstrators who are occupying a multi-million-pound home in Southwark

Occupation: Squatters have moved in to this house in south London, Britain's most expensive council house

Protest: The squatters hung banners out of the windows of the building near Borough Market

The squatters, mostly in their 20s and 30s, include students, a roofer, a part-time chef and a worker for a quango.

Spokesmen
 for the squatters said they all lived elsewhere in the capital but 
considered themselves ‘protesters’ and would take it in ‘shifts’ to 
occupy the building, which has a water supply but no electricity or 
heating. 

Some belong to a campaign group that is highlighting what they say is a housing shortage in the Labour-run borough.

The
 building was sold by council bosses to raise funds to pay for 20 modern
 local authority homes but the squatters say they are doubtful it will 
happen.

Sale: A council worker was seen at the property yesterday after it was sold for £2.96million

Removal: Signs from Southwark Council have been taken off the property after its sale to a private buyer

Protester Kate 
Sheldon, 27, a bike mechanic, said: ‘The occupation is going to last as 
long as possible. We’ll wait until Southwark gets a court order and then
 have a discussion about how to proceed.’

Another
 squatter, Wayne Davies, 26, arrived to do his shift at the house in 
between lectures in international development at the University of 
London’s School of Oriental and African studies, and an evening shift 
working as a chef.

Mr 
Davies, who lives in Brixton, said: ‘I’m sure the buyer can rest in 
confidence that he will get his property. We all know how these things 
end; we will be forcefully evicted.’

The 5,500 sq ft property – two dilapidated semi-detached homes sold as one lot – fetched £2.96million at auction.

Pricy: The building, which has stood empty for years, is due to be used as a family home or flats

Taking a stand: The squatters seem to have timed their protest to coincide with the auction

Boasting
 views of major London landmarks like The Shard, it was built by the 
Anchor Brewery in 1820 to house its managers and directors, and was 
later bought by the Courage brewery. A ‘Take Courage’ advertising slogan
 is still visible on its side wall.

Southwark councillor Richard Livingstone said the new owner would be able to bring the property up to a ‘good standard’.

But
 one neighbour said of the squatters: ‘They’re not paying rent or 
council tax or any of the other things that we have to do so why should 
they live there for free?’

Metropolitan Police officers visited the property with council officials on Monday and are now seeking legal advice.
