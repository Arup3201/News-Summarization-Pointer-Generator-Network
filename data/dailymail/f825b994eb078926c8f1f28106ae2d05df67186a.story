A nine-year-old fashion blogger from Boston is set to give a TED Talk this evening, as part of the organization’s TEDxCambridge conference.

Tobias Otting - a fourth-grader who lives in Newton, Massachusets, just on the outskirts of the state’s capital - is expected to give an informational talk on ‘the importance of finding your voice and sharing it,’ reports The Boston Globe.

Tobias captured the attention of TED’s higher-ups through his blog, called the Junior Sartorialist, which he started at the age of eight.

The young aesthete, who goes by Toby, announced the talk on his blog last month with a post that read: ‘Quickly dropping the news, before I scurry off to school, that I’m giving a TEDx talk in just a few weeks, on June 5, in Cambridge.  I’m so honored to be part of a group of such impressive speakers, and can’t wait to learn about them and hear their talks.’

Toby’s talk is scheduled among other presentations from TED’s more typical array of intellectual luminaries, including a cosmic explorer and a cognitive scientist.

In the last year, Toby has already accrued 11,591 visits to his site, with subject matter that extends beyond fashion, with topics like music, food, culture, and dance.

Standing at just four-and-a-half feet, Tobias is already interested in the finer aspects of life.

He
 wears a tie to school every day and enjoys frequent trips to the Boston
 Ballet, followed by high tea at some of the city’s most luxurious 
hotels.

These musings, among
 others, comprise a majority of the content on his blog – which he 
writes with the help of his mother, Laura Gassner Otting.

‘I thought if he was going to do this then there should be some substance behind what he’s doing. So he’s not just throwing out opinions and leaving them out there,’ Ms Otting told the paper.

Their collaboration works as such: Toby will brainstorm various article topics and then sit down with his mother, who will type his ideas. She’ll inquire into the deeper aspects of why her son finds these subjects important – the responses of which she also jots down, helping Toby sharpen his articles’ focus as a result.

‘She wanted me to articulate myself better, but she doesn’t tell me what I’m supposed to say,’ Toby said of the process.

Earlier this year, Toby’s blog 
captured the attention of TEDxCambridge’s executive producer Tamsen 
Webster, who is a friend of his mother’s.

He
 was required to audition for the honor alongside a pool of 30 other 
applicants. He won a spot, for which he is required to deliver an 
eight-minute speech to a packed auditorium on the Massachusetts 
Institute of Technology’s campus.

Ms Webster says of Toby’s appeal: ‘[He] can’t just get onstage and say that everyone should write a blog. You can look at Toby and see that there’s no gap in integrity between his idea and his passion for that idea. There are people of all ages who are unable to demonstrate all the pieces required to put together a TEDxCambridge talk. But there was never a question about Toby.’

While Toby admits that he is nervous in the lead-up to his talk, he says that there are some perks involved in the appointment.

‘My teacher said she may not give me as many writing assignments because I’m doing the talk,’ he said. ‘Now I just need to get out of my math assignments.’
