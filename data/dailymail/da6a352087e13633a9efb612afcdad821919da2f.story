Dramatic plans to bring forward a historic vote on Britain quitting the EU are being considered by David Cameron in a desperate effort to fend off the threat from UKIP.

Under the policy shift, driven by new Tory strategy chief Lynton Crosby, the Prime Minister would scrap plans to hold the ‘in/out’ referendum in 2017 and instead stage the crucial vote a year earlier.

The plans emerged amid dire warnings from senior Liberal Democrats that the referendum row was ‘tearing the Coalition apart’ and could result in an early General Election.

In the Commons this week, up to 100 Tory MPs are set to take the extraordinary step of condemning their own Government’s Queen’s Speech for failing to enshrine Mr Cameron’s referendum promise in law. The Prime Minister is likely to be out of the country for the vote but No 10 sources indicated last night that Tory Ministers will be ‘guided’ to abstain – to the fury of their Lib Dem Coalition partners.

It raises the highly unusual prospect of Conservative Cabinet Ministers deciding to sit on their hands in implicit criticism of a programme of legislation they helped to draft.

The Prime Minister is said to be ‘relaxed’ and happy to give backbench MPs a free vote on the issue. But former Lib Dem leader Sir Menzies Campbell claimed that it was ‘madness’ to consider quitting the EU.

He also warned that if the Coalition collapsed ‘in a flurry of dissent and bad temper’, it would be difficult to see his party co-operating with the Tories in any future pact.

Sir Menzies told The Mail on Sunday: ‘If it ends with the parties at each other’s throats, that would be meat and drink to Labour and UKIP.

‘If this experiment in Coalition ends in mutual recriminations, the chances of a similar arrangement in the future will be greatly reduced.’

One senior Downing Street source claims that Mr Crosby has warned Mr Cameron that 2017 is too far away to have any real electoral impact – and that the Prime Minister must stress that he would back an ‘out’  vote if he failed to negotiate  an acceptable new settlement with Brussels.

Mr Crosby has reportedly advised that the next Tory manifesto should contain a pledge to hold a vote by 2016 so that the party can promise the public’s ‘voice will be heard’ within a year of the poll.

Another source claimed that Mr Cameron’s referendum pledge in January had been rushed out after he was mistakenly informed that Ed Miliband was poised to beat him to it.

The source said a Tory MP reported back to No 10 in early December that he had overheard Tom Baldwin – a key aide to the Labour leader – speaking loudly on a mobile phone in the Commons about ‘beating Cameron to the punch’ by promising a referendum first.

‘As a result we have needlessly backed ourselves into a corner,’ the source added. Mr Baldwin last night denied ever advocating such a tactic.

Yesterday, Mr Miliband ruled out making such a pledge and accused the Tories of plunging the country into years of uncertainty over EU membership.

Last night, Downing Street insisted there were no current plans to bring forward the date of a referendum.
