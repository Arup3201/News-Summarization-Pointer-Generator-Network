While most New Yorkers do all they can to avoid rats lurking in subway stops and city alleyways, a group of students is actively searching them out.

Two teams from Fordham University have been traipsing across New York City to catch rats for research - in the hopes of finding out how the species has evolved differently across the island of Manhattan.

Photojournalist Johnny Milano, who is based on Long Island, snapped a series of intriguing images showing the students hard at work as they sniffed out the fearsome rodents - before snipping off parts of their tails or feet for tests.

The black-and-white photo series shows the students heading to far corners of the city or climbing through shrubbery as they put down traps filled with peanut butter, bacon bits and other greasy foods. A few days later, they return to collect them and carry out their tests.

Hunt: Fordham University student Matt Combs measures a rat as part of a project to determine if rats in different parts of New York City display different genetic traits. The project began in 2013 and the small team has been collecting samples across the city ever since

Search: Another student, Otis Wood, searches for traps, which the team has so far laid across Central Park and Inwood

Study: Sample can be any part that contains DNA, but is most often taken from the tail or the foot, photographer Johnny Milano explained

The students believe that there are genetic differences in rats that are specific to their area in the city, that is, rats in downtown Manhattan could be genetically different from those in the Upper West Side. 

They have noticed, perhaps unsurprisingly, that well-kept areas of the city do not have many rats - such as Central Park - whereas well-populated areas, including playgrounds, are overrun with the rodents. 

'I thought it was ironic, how rat populations relate to socioeconomics,' Milano told CNN in an earlier interview.

The duo's project started in 2013 and will continue for at least two years. So far, they have set traps and collected samples in Central Park and Inwood, which is the northern-most part of Manhattan, and next year they will be searching other parts of the city, including Times Square.

'Our research seeks to understand how rats inhabit this environment,' student Matt Combs explained to Vice. 'What makes them more or less successful, and how they travel through a dense urban matrix like Manhattan.'  

Their tests have so far found 'there's a pattern of evolution', CNN reported. 

Ongoing search: The team plans to set more traps next year in parts of the city, including Times Square

Strange sight: Milano said he was inspired to capture the project because he wanted to look at a part of the city he had not seen before

Findings: The team believes the rats could have different genetics depending on where they are found in the city

For Milano, the strange subject choice was appealing. 

'I wanted to focus on a project in the city that I hadn't seen before,' he said. 

In other photographs, shared on his website, Milano snapped another rat catcher team appropriately named 'R.A.T.S.', which stands for Ryder's Alley Trencherfed Society.

The team, led by Richard Ryder, goes out at night with between four and ten dogs to catch as many as 20 rats in areas of the city. They train the dogs, mostly terriers, by allowing them to chew on rats as pups, or by simply taking them on searches until they show their genetic leaning towards hunting.

The Fordham students are now working with R.A.T.S to collect samples for their study. The students found that the rat hunters were a far more efficient way of helping them find the rodents, Vice reported.

The team says they have the support of nearby residents - and police even point them in the right direction for their next hunt.  

Killed: A dead rat can be seen inside a trap after being poisoned with Isothesia, a chloroform-like substance that the scientists use to kill rats that are still alive in the traps. They capture the rats by putting peanut butter or bacon bits inside the traps

Log: A book shows the researchers' log of rat numbers; they also get rats with the help of a city rat hunting society

Hopeful: The project, which will continue throughout next year, could show how rats have evolved within the island of Manhattan
