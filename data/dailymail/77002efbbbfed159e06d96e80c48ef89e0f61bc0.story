Taking it on the chin: Volker Beckers (pictured), 49, faces questions over his role as a director of Scaris Limited. The Maltese-based firm was used to funnel money between npower and its German owner RWE

A top businessman who helped the German owners of Npower avoid paying millions of pounds of tax is now advising HM Revenue and Customs, it has emerged.

Volker Beckers, the former boss of the energy giant, oversaw the transfer of money through a Maltese company which saved RWE from paying corporation tax in the UK.

The loophole has since been closed, but questions have been raised over the suitability of Mr Beckers to sit on the HMRC given his role in helping RWE with tax avoidance at a time when energy bills have been soaring.

Official figures released last year showed that the amount of tax lost through non-payment and avoidance increased in 2012 to £35bn.

Between 2008 and 2012, Mr Beckers, 49, was a director of Scaris Limited, which was run on a tiny budget out of an office in Malta and was used to divert billions of pounds from RWE, Npower's German owner, to the UK company.

This meant that Scaris, which only had one employee earning less than £10,000 a year, made £885 million over four years on which it would only be required to pay as little as 5 per cent in the tax haven.

Although the scheme was legal, it is estimated that it saved RWE from paying millions of pounds of tax and has led to criticism of Mr Becker's role advising HMRC. He was appointed as a Government adviser at the start of last year, weeks after resigning as the chief executive of npower with an £850,000 payoff.

Margaret Hodge, the Labour MP and chair of the Public Accounts Committe, told the Mirror: 'If Mr Beckers has been involved in aggressive tax avoidance, there is no way he should be advising the organisation whose job it is to maximise the tax collected.'

Raising questions: Margaret Hodge, the Labour MP, said 'there is no way' Volker Beckers should be advising the HMRC if he has been involved in 'aggressive tax avoidance'

Richard Murphy of Tax Research echoed Mrs Hodge's comments. 'He is a German national who has been a director of a company that has clearly been involved with tax avoidance.

'How this qualifies him to supervise our national tax authority is hard to explain.'

A spokesman for RWE npower argued that the reason they paid 'little or no UK corporation tax' was because of the investment RWE had made in the UK.

'It is Government policy to use tax reliefs to incentivise investment and it is saddening to be criticised for investing in secure and lower carbon energy that is desperately needed in this country,' he said.

 'RWE npower does not engage in tax avoidance – borrowing money to fund investment in vital assets in the UK is not tax avoidance. 

'The fact that we borrowed from Malta made no difference to our UK corporation tax.'

A spokesman for HMRC said that 'rigorous vetting' would have been carried out before Mr Beckers was appointed and that any conflicts of interest would have been checked.

'Non-Executive Directors bring valuable external and commercial experience to HMRC,' he said.

'However, they are not responsible for the day-to-day management of HMRC, nor are they responsible for tax policy or for handling confidential individual or corporate taxpayer issues.'
