'Bland': Amanda Redman, former star of New Tricks, criticised the programme when she left in 2013. It is now cancelled to make way for more BBC drama

It has already been criticised by its own cast for not being as good as it used to be. Now BBC1 has called time on detective drama New Tricks after 12 years on our screens. 

Bosses said they will axe the programme, which follows a squad of retired police officers recruited to investigate unsolved crimes, after its twelfth series this year to ‘increase the range of drama on the channel’.

All of the original line-up – James Bolam, Amanda Redman, Alun Armstrong and Dennis Waterman – have already quit the show. Mr Bolam, 79, said it had ‘gone stale’ when he announced his departure in 2011.

Miss Redman, 57, who left in 2013, said it was ‘bland’, adding: ‘The characters are not being as anarchic as they used to be, which I think is a huge shame.’

Launched in 2003, the light-hearted crime drama won legions of fans as long-suffering boss DSI Sandra Pullman, played by Redman, and her irreverent team of old-school policeman looked into unsolved crimes.

Viewers were won over by the on-screen chemistry between Redman, James Bolam, 79, Alun Armstrong, 68, Dennis Waterman, 66.

But, over the years, the ageing team gradually left to be replaced with the slightly younger alternatives of Denis Lawson, 67, Nicholas Lyndhurst, 53, and Tamzin Outhwaite, 44. 

Armstrong also complained about developments in the series, saying: ‘My character has got saner. Which I’m not too enamoured with.’

BBC bosses promised that the final series, featuring 10 new episodes, would go out on a high.

Last September, Waterman became the last member of the original cast to announce he was leaving the show. The star – who also sings the theme tune – said it was because he missed ‘the old crew, the original line-up’.

His spokesman said at the time: ‘The chemistry between [the original line up] on the set was remarkable.’ He added that there had been ‘no big falling out’ - simply that the old team had worked together for a long time.

Waterman will only feature in two episodes of the final series, which began filming last November. Larry Lamb, 67, will replace him for the last episodes.

In a joint statement, Charlotte Moore, Controller BBC One and Ben Stephenson, Controller BBC Drama said: ‘We are incredibly proud of New Tricks and would like to thank Roy Mitchell the brilliant creator, Wall to Wall and Headstrong, and all the cast and teams involved across the 12 series.

‘However, on BBC One it’s important to make room for new series and continue to increase the range of drama on the channel, so it won’t be returning after the next series airs this summer’

Fans of the show took to social media to express disappointment that New Tricks was over but also conceded that it was perhaps the right time to do so.

Andrew White, from Doncaster, said: ‘It had run its course really, hadn’t it?’ 

Matthew Donovan, from Watford, tweeted: ‘So sad to hear this. I’ve been a huge fan since series one. Can we please have the odd special still? ‘

Gaynor Rowse, from East Sussex, tweeted: ‘No what a shame, no doubt it will be replaced with rubbish. Really don’t know why I pay my TV licence.’
