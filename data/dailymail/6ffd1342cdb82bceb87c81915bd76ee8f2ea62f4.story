The oldest surviving garden swing in the world has been discovered hidden at the bottom of a quiet country garden - in full working order.

Historians have identified the huge 12ft high swing at Ian and Debbie Wilkins’ property as the prototype for the first garden swing produced by inventor Charles Wicksteed almost 90 years ago.

The swing, in Kettering, Northamptonshire, has provided fun for generations of children, but remarkably still has the original thick wooden seat, chains and red and green paintwork.

Thrill seekers on some of the swings at Wicksteed Park in the late 1920s

It is located in the former garden of a manor house which belonged to the family of Wicksteed, who created the modern-day swing and slide.

Its shape, size and lack of a tell-tale name plate, which went on all play equipment when he began to sell it in 1926, show it was a prototype given by Wicksteed to his family as part of pre-production trials.

Wicksteed opened Wicksteed Park in Kettering in 1921 because he wanted to give something back to the town he loved.

The swing’s existence was discovered after the park appealed for photographs and evidence of old Wicksteed play equipment as part of a project to archive the history of the park.

The swing now sits in the garden of the manor house’s outbuildings, which were converted into the home of Ian and Debbie Wilkins.

Their children, Jamie and Luke, who have now left home, played on the swing for years, and the family was amazed to hear of its historical significance.

'The swing was here when we moved into the house 11 years ago and its height and the way it was constructed made us think that it was old and had been here for some time,' said Mr Wilkins.

'We knew that the old manor house next door was where Charles’ daughter Hilda had lived for many years.

'But
 it was only when we heard about the park’s appeal for information that 
we made the connection and wondered if it was a prototype or part of an 
early production run.'

Charles Wicksteed (seen standing), the man who changed leisure time for ever

Oliver Wicksteed, chairman of the Wicksteed Charitable Trust and Charles Wicksteed’s great grandson, said: 'The manor house was in the family for some considerable time and I can remember talk of the place when I was growing up.

'But when we appealed for information about Wicksteed play equipment, I never dreamed the search would take us back there.

'The swing is still painted green with red mountings, which were the traditional Wicksteed colours but significantly, there is no name plate, which went on all commercially produced equipment.

'It is in remarkable condition. There is some minor wear and tear on the frame but the big, thick wooden seat is as sturdy as ever and the whole thing looks like it could survive another 100 years.

'We are very proud of Charles Wicksteed and the revolutionary way he changed leisure time for ever. Wicksteed play equipment literally went to the four corners of the earth.'
