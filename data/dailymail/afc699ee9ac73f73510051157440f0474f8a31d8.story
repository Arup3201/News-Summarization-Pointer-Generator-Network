The Royal London Hospital is offering HIV screening to all A&E patients having a blood test

A London hospital is offering HIV screening to everyone who has a blood test in an attempt to diagnose the 25 per cent of people unaware they have the virus.

Throughout April, The Royal London Hospital, in Whitechapel, is offering everyone having a blood test taken in A&E routine HIV screening.

The scheme has been deemed necessary in an attempt to 'diagnose the undiagnosed' because these people cause an estimated 75 per cent of new cases.

Usually a patient or doctor must specifically request an HIV test if it is deemed necessary.

‘HIV can be symptomless for a long time,’ said Dr Chloe Orkin, the Barts Health HIV Consultant behind the routine testing plan.

‘That means it's very easy for people not to be diagnosed until it's too late for today's life-saving treatments to have their best effect.

'People are still dying of HIV in the UK - but only because they test too late.’

The pilot comes after research found people who were diagnosed late accounted for nearly a third of all AIDS deaths last year.

Straight men are the least likely to be tested, said Dr Ann Sullivan, from the Sexual Health Centre at Chelsea and Westminster Hospital.

Dr Sullivan, consultant physician in HIV at the hospital and an honorary lecturer at Imperial College, said: 'Those who don't know they are infected are responsible for between 50 and 75 per cent of new infections. That is a hugely disproportional number of people passing on HIV.

'It is not likely cancer, where people who have it are seen as blameless. There is still a lot of stigma particularly among heterosexual men, and women.

'This group do not think they are at risk, so are more likely to present later, but if you have sex without protection you should have a test.

The scheme has been deemed necessary as 25 per cent of HIV positive people in the UK are unaware that they are infected

'We need another big campaign because
there is a lack of knowledge. People remember those scary ads from the 
80s with the tombstone. That was right for the time, but things have 
moved on. AIDS is not a death sentence, or indeed is it anything to be 
ashamed of.

'With new treatments and 
technologies, there is only around a five or ten year difference in life
expectancy. People with HIV go to work, they have children, they lead 
very normal lives.'

Despite this, other recent research found that between 1990 and 2010, cases of HIV infection rose by 76 
per cent due to fewer people using condoms.

Experts
believe that the fall in condom use has been causes by the development 
of antiretroviral drugs which have reduced the levels of fear associated
with the disease.

Dr Steve Taylor, HIV Specialist at Birmingham Heartlands 
Hospital and Medical Director of Saving Lives, an HIV awareness 
charity, said: ‘One of the things our campaigns help
do is correct some commonly-held out-dated myths that perpetuate this 
stigma which make the lives of people living with HIV very difficult.

‘Getting tested, looking after your sexual health, education and prevention are what it’s all about.

‘If
people have taken risks and by that I simply mean having unprotected 
sex, then there is every reason to get tested - it could save your 
life.’

The screening programme is being part-organised by HIV awareness charity Saving Lives, which is running a campaign called the Saving Lives Avengers.

The initiative aims to use well-known sports personalities to educate people about the importance of HIV testing.

The campaign, which is being 
organised by Barts Health NHS Trust and HIV charity Saving Lives, is 
being piloted in Whitechapel because the area is thought to have an HIV 
population five times the size of the national average – in Whitechapel 
six in every 1,000 people are believed to be HIV positive.
