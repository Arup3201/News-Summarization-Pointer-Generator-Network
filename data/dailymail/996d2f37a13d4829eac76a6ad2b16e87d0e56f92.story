These dramatic pictures show federal agents in full body armor and breathing apparatus raiding the home of Kevin Curtis, 45 - who has been charged with  trying to poison President Barack Obama.

The officers, armed with automatic weapons, were taking no chances as they entered the property in the sleepy neighbourhood of Corinth, Mississippi.

Curtis is suspected of sending letters containing deadly poison ricin to President Obama and to Mississippi Senator Roger Wicker.

Raid: Armed federal agents wearing hazardous material suits and breathing apparatus enter the West Hills Subdivision home of Paul Kevin Curtis in Corinth, Mississippi

Target: Law enforcement officials blocked off the property yesterday after taking Curtis into custody under suspicion of sending letters covered in ricin to the President Barack Obama and Senator Roger Wicker

Hazard: The heavily-armed agents were fully equipped for the operation at Curtis's home where he was arrested on Wednesday

The agents were carefully washed down and their weapons and other gear bagged up after the raid in case of contamination.

Senator Wicker has revealed he has had one encounter already with the Elvis impersonator 
charged with trying to poison him and the president.

Speaking with reporters on Thursday, he said that he met Curtis once, and described him as ‘very entertaining.’

Curtis, who believed he had 
uncovered a conspiracy to sell human body parts on the black market and 
sometimes performed as an Elvis Presley impersonator was arrested on Wednesday.

Charged: Curtis is suspected of sending letters containing ricin to President Barack Obama and Senator Wicker

He
is accused of sending ricin-laced letters this week to the President 
and to Senator Roger Wicker, a Republican from Mississippi, that arrived
just one day after the deadly bombings in Boston.

Curtis had previously sent letters to Sen. 
Wicker and officials from his office alerted 
authorities about the frequency of his correspondence when the suspicious letter was found.

The
suspect was originally identified by federal sources as Kenneth Curtis 
of Tupelo, Mississippi, according to local media reports. It is not known if 
Curtis has used Kenneth as an alias.

An
affidavit shows the letters sent to Obama and Wicker both warned their 
intended recipients: 'Maybe I have your attention now, even if that 
means that someone must die.'

Curtis is 'believed to be responsible
for the mailings of the three letters which contained a granular substance that 
preliminarily tested positive for ricin,' the FBI said in a statement.

Investigators with the Secret Service
and the FBI are using the Lee County Sheriff’s Department, in Tupelo, 
as a staging area for their investigation, according to The 
Clarion-Ledger. It is not clear where the suspect is being held.

His
former wife, Laura Curtis, told reporters that her ex-husband makes a 
living by impersonating the King at various functions, including church 
events and birthday parties, the Wall Street Journal reported.

She
told the paper that the message: ‘To see a wrong and not expose it, is 
to become a silent partner to its continuance,’ which appears on both 
the letter addressed to Obama and to Sen. Wicker, is his ‘favorite 
saying.’

Laura Curtis told the Journal that 
the two of them were married for a decade and divorced in 2002.

They 
have four children together. ‘I can’t imagine him doing this,’ she said.

Last night Ricky Curtis, who said he was Kevin 
Curtis' cousin, said the family was shocked by the news of the arrest. 
He described his cousin as a 'super entertainer' who impersonated Elvis 
and numerous other singers.

'We're all in shock. I don't think 
anybody had a clue that this kind of stuff was weighing on his mind,' 
Ricky Curtis said in a telephone interview.

Elvis: Curtis is known to have performed as a professional Elvis impersonator using the stage name KC. He is seen here singing in a image take from a video on You Tube

Clean up: The agents have their clothes cleaned in case of chemical exposure outside the property. All suits and gear, including weapons were placed in hazardous materials bags for an extensive cleanup

Bagged: An armed federal agent collects the hazardous material suits and breathing apparatus. The level of care taken shows the potential dangers they faced during the operation

Ricky Curtis said his cousin had 
written about problems he had with a cleaning business and that he felt 
the government had not treated him well, but he said nobody in the 
family would have expected this. He said the writings were titled 
Missing Pieces.

A Facebook account entitled Kevin Curtis Live (KC), which is believed to be that of the suspect, contains rants about a body parts conspiracy. One, posted on Tuesday, said: 'I'm on the hidden front lines of a secret war. A war that is making Billions of dollars for corrupt mafia related organizations and people. (bone, tissue, organ, body parts harvesting black market) when we lay our loved ones to rest....

'My mother wants me to SHUT UP. My brothers fear me. My sister hates me. My cousins have hostility towards me (they work in healthcare) I have lost most of my friends. I have spent more than $130,000.00 on legal fees in 13.5 yrs.

'They burned down my home, killed my dogs, my cat, my rabbit, blew up my 1966 Plymouth Valent. They destroyed my marriage, they distracted my career, they stalked, they trolled, they came in to my home, took my computers, had me arrested 22 times and guess what? I am still a thorn in their corrupt a****!'

Armed: The agents were taking no chances when they entered the property following Curtis's arrest. The raid, and Curtis' arrest have shocked residents of the normally sleepy Mississippi neighbourhood

Alert: The alleged ricin plot and the Boston bombings have left the US on a high state of alert. Officers can be seen here handing in their weapons to be bagged up

On the same day he posted a photograph of a revolver, with the comment 'say hello to my little friend'. The page's author wrote that he was 
trying to 'expose various parties within the government, FBI, police 
departments' for what he believed was 'a conspiracy to ruin my 
reputation in the community as well as an ongoing effort to break down 
the foundation I worked more than 20 years to build in the country music
scene.'

Ricky Curtis said his cousin, a martial arts fan, ran a cleaning business, believed to be called The Cleaning Crew. He
added: 'As far as him being anti-government, I'm not going to say that,
but he had some issues with some stuff that happened with his cleaning 
business.'

Online posts refer to a conspiracy Curtis alleges he uncovered when working at a local hospital between 1998-2000, when he says he stumbled upon: 'a refrigerator full of dismembered body parts & organs wrapped in plastic in the morgue of the largest non-metropolitan healthcare organization in the United States of America.'

On Tuesday there was a Facebook post linking to an article about a charity initiative, with the comment: 'This is KC & I approve this concept!' The two letters mailed to Washington, DC were both intercepted at a 
mail screening facility in Maryland on Tuesday and initial tests found 
the pieces of mail contained the toxic component that can be fatal when 
ingested.

Both letters sent to the politicians contained the same message, ‘To see a wrong and not expose it, is to become a silent partner to its continuance.’ 

They also had the same signature that read: ‘I am KC and I approve this message.’ The letters contained a Memphis postmark and had no return address. Law enforcement officials told CBS News that the ricin found in the letters was 'low grade' and 'less than one percent toxin.'

The FBI has said there is no obvious link between the letters, postmarked on April 8, and the deadly bombings in Boston on Monday.

Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Missouri said on Wednesday spoke to the press about the investigation into the letter writer and said the person in question 'writes a lot of letters to (Congress) members.'

A suspicious letter was also reportedly sent to Sen. Carl Levin, D-Michigan, at his office in Saginaw, Michigan but there was no information if the letter tested positive for the toxic substance. Senator Richard Shelby, a Republican from Alabama, has also reported a suspicious letter.

A
second letter containing a granular substance that preliminarily tested
positive for ricin was received at an offsite mail screening facility.

The
envelope, addressed to the President, was immediately quarantined by 
U.S. Secret Service personnel, and a coordinated investigation with the 
FBI was initiated. It is important to note that operations at the White 
House have not been affected as a result of the investigation.

Additionally,
filters at a second government mail screening facility preliminarily 
tested positive for ricin this morning. Mail from that facility is being
tested.

Any time 
suspicious powder is located in a mail facility, field tests are 
conducted. The field and other preliminary tests can produce 
inconsistent results. Any time field tests indicate the possibility of a
biological agent, the material is sent to an accredited laboratory for 
further analysis.

Only
a full analysis performed at an accredited laboratory can determine the
presence of a biological agent such as ricin. Those tests are currently
being conducted and generally take 24 to 48 hours.

The
investigation into these letters remains ongoing, and more letters may 
still be received. There is no indication of a connection to the attack 
in Boston.
