The ageing process of a woman from infancy to old age is captured beautifully in this timelapse illustration  by Korean artist and illustrator Seok Jeong Hyeon.

Mr Seok, who is better known as Stonehouse, has meticulously rendered each of life’s stages in layers, so that a baby swiftly transforms into a growing girl who, in her turn becomes a young lady before the inevitable happens and an ageing woman emerges from the skilful brush of the artist.

The four-minute video captures the poignancy of ageing wonderfully as the artist affects minute changes which thoroughly alter the painting, although the features of the 'subject' remain the same throughout.

Step-by-step details in short, swift strokes are added to the painting, which becomes more and more lifelike as it ‘ages’.

The face becomes longer, losing its baby fat chubbiness and hair goes through various colour and length changes. 

Mr Seok manipulates his digital brush skilfully, adding minute changes upon each layer and building a picture of a woman who has left her youth behind and is going towards old age.

As the painting becomes ‘older’, the subject too takes on mature gaze.

The artist adds more wrinkles to the picture and an older lady emerges. Hair is now nearly snow-white and the wrinkles have deepened even more and are no longer just constrained to the corners of the mouth and eyes.

Skin has lost its elasticity, and sags down. Signs of ageing are most obvious in the neck area, a truly lifelike representation of old age.

This level of precise detailing is carried through to the clasped hands, with gnarled and bony knuckles.
