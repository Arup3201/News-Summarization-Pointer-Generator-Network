A singer performed a sick version of the song Bad, Bad Leroy Brown with the lyrics rewritten to mock the shooting teenager Michael Brown in front of a room full of cops.

Gary Fishell played a mocking version of the Jim Croce song, giving it a new chorus referring to 'Dead, dead Michael Brown'.

The new lyrics, aired at an Elks Lodge in Glendale, California, relived the shooting and said the dead brown 'looked like some old Swiss cheese' and had 'his brain... splattered on the floor' in video obtained by TMZ.

Mocking: The song made fun of the police shooting of teenage Michael Brown, and called his killer a 'badass'

Audience: Half of the 50-60 people attending the California party were serving or retired police

Shot dead: The song mocked slain teen Michael brown

Fishell compared Brown to a 'roadkill dog' in the song, while praising Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson as a 'badass'.

An outraged attendee at the party filmed part of the song when they realized nobody was objected to the new, racist lyrics. Sources told TMZ around 30 retired and serving cops were at the party, thrown by retired LAPD officer Joe Myers.

Lawyers for Fishell have tried to pass off the performance as a joke, defending their client as a 'goofball who writes funny songs'.

One said: 'He thought the room would get a kick out of it'. 

They said in hindsight he acknowledges the song was 'in poor taste'.

Myers defended Fishell's right to mock the dead teen, telling the site: 'This is America. We can say what we want. This is a free America.' He also pointed out he wasn't in charge of Fishell's set list.

An Elks Lodge spokesman said the event was nothing to do with them - and both Fishell and Myers could be punished.

He said: 'it's deplorable and inappropriate and the Lodge will take disciplinary action against [Fishell] and possibly the people who organized this event.' 

Funny? Fishell made fun of Brown's death in Ferguson this summer, which fired racial tensions across America. The song describes the scene, above, when Brown lay dead in front of officer Darren Wilson

Michael Brown learned a lesson about a messin'

With a badass policeman

And he's bad, bad Michael Brown

Baddest thug in the whole damn town

Badder than old King Kong

Meaner than a junkyard dog 

Two men took to fightin'

And Michael punched in through the door

And Michael looked like some old Swiss cheese

His brain was splattered on the floor

And he's dead, dead Michael Brown

Deadest man in the whole damn town

His whole life's long gone

Deader than a roadkill dog
