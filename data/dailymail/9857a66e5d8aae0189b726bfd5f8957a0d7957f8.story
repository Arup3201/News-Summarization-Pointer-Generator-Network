Melita Norwood, codenamed Hola, was one of the KGB's most prized spies

She ended her days in a cosy, third-floor rented flat in a sheltered housing complex. Untroubled by the problems of the world, and with the added comfort of her married daughter Anita living nearby, Melita Norwood enjoyed the tranquillity of the small development ringed with flowering trees, and got on with her jam-making until her death, aged 93.

How fortunate she was. In many other countries, the grey-haired great-grandmother would have ended her days in prison, or even been shot.

For Mrs Norwood was no ordinary granny. Over a period of 35 years, she had been a spy for the KGB, passing on Britain’s nuclear secrets that enabled the Soviet Union to catch up in building the atomic bomb.

Two weeks ago, nine years after her death, Melita’s barely-known name unexpectedly re-emerged when the Mitrokhin Archive, a file of top secret Soviet documents, was made available to the public for the first time.

The file arrived in Britain in 1992 when KGB Major Vasili Mitrokhin defected to Britain, bringing with him, in six trunks, an archive of 30 years of Soviet secrets. Intriguingly, it included profiles of 200 British KGB collaborators written by their Kremlin handlers.

Mentioned only by codenames, Guy Burgess and Donald Maclean, of the infamous ‘Cambridge Five’, got critical mention: Burgess for not dressing tidily and being ‘constantly under the influence of alcohol’, and Maclean for his ‘drunk spells’ and being ‘not very good at keeping secrets’.

Melita Norwood, on the other hand — codenamed Hola — was a model of reliability. Her handler described her as ‘a loyal, trustworthy, disciplined agent’ who passed to the KGB a large amount of vital data.

Unlike those Mata Hari-style seductresses whose treachery is based in the boudoir, Mrs Norwood was a very different kind of agent.

She was, in many ways, the perfect spy, living during most of her long years of treason in a pebble-dash semi in Bexleyheath, South-East London, with her maths and chemistry teacher husband Hilary, growing fresh vegetables in her back garden allotment and bringing up their daughter Anita.

No life could have looked more ordinary. Except for one thing — she worked at the British Non‑Ferrous Metals Research Association offices in Euston, central London.

Behind this dull company name was an important firm involved in vital research. Towards the end of the war, it was carrying out highly classified government research into the properties of uranium, as part of Britain’s atomic bomb project.

Melita (everyone called her ‘Lette’) had joined the company as a clerk in 1937.

As a member of the Independent Labour Party, and later the Communist Party, she had already been recruited as an agent at a meeting of the Friends of the Soviet Union.

Her bookbinder father was a Latvian immigrant and Left-wing activist whose slogan was ‘Down with everything that’s up, and up with everything that’s down’.

He founded the Southern Worker And Labour And Socialist Journal in Southampton. Her mother, too, was a suffragette with far-Left sympathies.

Although her father died when she was six, the family still held Left-wing views which the bright child absorbed from an early age.

But as she became head girl of Hitchin Grammar School and captained the hockey team, few could have predicted the extraordinary outcome of such an early communist indoctrination.

The girl who had become bored with university life at Southampton after only a year was soon being promoted from clerk to secretary.

At the height of the war in 1943, she took time off to have a child, Anita. When she returned to the firm in 1944, she went to work for the director, Dr G. L. Bailey, who wanted Lette because he knew she could cope with the technical jargon. 

For the KGB, this was an unbelievable piece of good fortune, because Bailey happened to be a member of the advisory committee on the atom bomb project.

Working so close to highly classified research, Lette had to go through a security vetting. Incredibly, despite doubts about her extreme Left-wing sympathies and links, she was cleared. Indeed, so trusted was Lette that she had access to Bailey’s two safes. One was in his office and the other at his London home.

He kept sensitive documents in both, sometimes holding evening meetings at home at which Lette was expected to be on hand. These usually ended so late that she stayed overnight.

Her consequent contribution of atomic intelligence to the Soviet Union was incalculable, certainly big enough for the Russians to declare that she had made ‘a valuable contribution to the development of work in this field’. Lette’s work for the Soviets continued right up until her retirement from the company in 1972, when she was 60.

Through all those years, her husband, a fellow Communist Party member who died in 1985, knew she was spying for the KGB.

But to the neighbours in Garden Avenue, Bexleyheath, a pleasant street of semis and discreet net curtains, Lette was viewed as a charming old lady who just happened to be a bit eccentric and very openly Left-wing.

For example, she used Che Guevara tea mugs and habitually posted copies of the Communist Morning Star through the letterboxes of 32 of her neighbours. 

No sniff of suspicion: To her neighbours she was a charming old lady who was a little bit eccentric 

Everyone liked her. One resident, Robert Leck, 78, a former bomb disposal unit RAF corporal, recalls Lette doing the shopping at the Co-op for other elderly neighbours, visiting anyone she thought might be lonely or unwell.

‘We all knew where her politics lay. I remember her talking to me once about Karl Marx,’ he says. ‘She thought he was the best.

‘And she had her gardening: flowers at the front, vegetables at the back. Who would have thought she was a spy? I certainly didn’t.’

Even after she was publicly exposed in 1999 as having worked for the KGB, neighbours found it very hard to condemn the nice old girl who’d been such a good neighbour for decades.

‘She was lovely, a pure lady,’ says Sheila Howell, who was a neighbour for more than 20 years.

MI5 worked out who ‘Hola’ was in 1992, soon after Soviet defector Mitrokhin arrived in Britain with his KGB file. But a decision not to put her on trial was quickly taken so that the collapsing Soviets would remain in ignorance about just how much we knew.

When she was unmasked publicly as ‘Hola’ seven years later, no action was taken against her because by then she was 87, and Jack Straw, then Labour Home Secretary, decided that at her age, nothing was to be gained from sending her to prison.

Some believe, however, the real reason she was not put on trial was to avoid embarrassing details emerging about MI5’s mistake in allowing her to work as a personal secretary at the very heart of Britain’s secret atomic research, even though she was known to have Communist sympathies.

For her part, Lette Norwood didn’t allow exposure of her treachery to ruin her Morning Star delivery routine, which continued uninterrupted.

Had she seen for herself her KGB handler’s description of her as ‘loyal’ and ‘trustworthy’, it would have come as no surprise, for this is precisely how she saw herself in doing her bit to ‘prevent the defeat’ of the Communist creed.

‘I did not want money. It was not that side I was interested in. I just wanted Russia to be on equal footing with the West,’ she told the media crowding at her front door in 1999 after being publicly exposed, before politely closing it.

In Wombourne, South Staffordshire, 120 miles away, her daughter Anita, a school laboratory technician, was astonished at the revelations about her elderly mother, and described herself as being ‘in a state of disbelief’.

When her identity was revealed, the then Home Secretary 

‘Whatever she may have done, I love her,’ said the mother of two. ‘She’s a very good person, very strong and totally unmaterialistic.’

Three years after being exposed, Lette sold the semi in Bexleyheath and moved to be near her daughter, renting a flat in the sheltered housing complex.

‘It was a complete shock at the time,’ says Anita, now 71. ‘I talked to her about the spying, but she told me very little of what she had done, though she did say my father didn’t approve.

But she always felt she did the right thing. She told me she would have been prepared to be tried as a war criminal and would have accepted a prison sentence.’

Right up to her death in 2005, Mrs Norwood never wavered from the conviction that what she did was right.

The KGB awarded her the prestigious military honour the Order of the Red Banner. It also offered her a pension of £20 a month.

She declined it — her spying was, after all, a matter of principle.
