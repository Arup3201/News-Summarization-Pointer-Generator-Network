Bianca Jagger has hit out at abusers who trolled her after she opposed plans for Everton's new stadium, branding them worse than 'dictators and war criminals'.

The 69-year-old ex-wife of Mick Jagger was subjected to vicious 'racist and sexist abuse' online after coming out in support of a campaign to stop Everton FC building a new stadium.

The human rights campaigner said she had rarely received such a level of abuse despite campaigning for years against dictators and war criminals.

Despite the abuse, she told the trolls 'you'll not silence me' and vowed to continue her support against the possibility of Everton building a new stadium in Walton Hall Park in Liverpool.

Writing on Twitter, she said: 'I have campaigned in defence of human rights, social justice, peace and environmental protection for over 30 years.

'I've faced dangerous situations in wars and speaking out against ruthless dictators and brutal war criminals. My choices were not always popular.

'But I have rarely received as vile, racist and sexist tweets as I received for signing a petition to the Liverpool City Council urging them not to sell or destroy Walton Hall Park.

'I decided to support a community that want their children to have access to a park. Tweets from supporters of Everton's new ground were sexist and racist.

'Throughout my life, I have been threatened by death squads in El Salvador, Honduras, Guatemala, by Serbs in Bosnia. You'll not silence me.'

Walton Hall Park is the possible site for a new Everton FC stadium, which would see the club move from Goodison Park.

The proposed move has left fans divided, with campaigners desperate to save the green space, saying it would be a 'disaster' for the community.

Ms Jagger took to Twitter on January 2 urging people to sign a petition to save the park, after being encouraged to do so by Chrisie Byrne, of Friends of Walton Hall Park.

Ms Byrne said she was 'absolutely mortified' after dozens of trolls started bombarding Ms Jagger with 'disgusting' messages.

She said: 'I'm proud of my city but I'm not proud of what these people have done.

'I felt responsible, as I'd tweeted her the campaign and she'd supported us. But now I've had phone calls with her, and she's so supportive of the campaign, she's read everything about it.

'It doesn't matter that she's not from round here - it's that the fight is right and she wants to support us.'

Ms Byrne added: 'The fact this woman has been in war zones and never been abused this badly is just awful. Most of them have deleted the messages, but myself and Bianca saved them and will take them to the authorities.'

The potential development on Walton Hall Park would provide Everton with a 50,000-seater stadium and create 1,000 new homes and 30,000 square metres of leisure, retail and restaurant space.

A council spokesman said: 'We are continuing to listen to all views about the potential development at Walton Hall Park.

'The mayor has established a green strategy group to scrutinise the use of green space in the city to help formulate the local plan which will guide Liverpool's growth while protecting its heritage and green space.'

Ms Jagger is not the only star to back a green campaign in Liverpool recently.

Liverpool-born Sex and The City star Kim Cattrall has also previously weighed in on the campaign to save some inner city parkland.

Everton has long been looking to move from Goodison Park to a modern stadium.

The club believes Goodison Park, the Premiership team’s home since 1892, can no longer generate sufficient revenue from a maximum capacity of 39,600.

It announced plans for a new ground in Kirkby in 2006, but they were rejected by central government three years later.

The idea of sharing a ground with Liverpool FC has been touted several times, although this has since been dismissed. Fans from both clubs objected to the plans.

Liverpool announced in 2005 it was planning a new stadium to replace Anfield, but later confirmed it would instead expand its existing ground.

In April, Liverpool City Council reaffirmed its commitment to working with Everton on the prospect of a new stadium.

It was revealed last year that the club was exploring options for a new home inside the city boundaries of Liverpool.
