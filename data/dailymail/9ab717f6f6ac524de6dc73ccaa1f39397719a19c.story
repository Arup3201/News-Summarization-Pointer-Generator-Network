Experienced: River guide Russ Cole said this was his first rescue in 25 years

A brave river guide risked his life by 
diving into rushing rapids to rescue a man who was knocked unconscious 
after falling out of a small raft at Washington's Husum Falls.

Incredible footage captured the moment Russ Cole plunged into the White Salmon River and dragged the man to safety just seconds after his fall, preventing what could have been a terrible tragedy.

Cole, a guide at Zoller's Outdoor Odyssey's which runs whitewater rafting trips, was sitting in a small boat as a group of four rafters dipped over the 14-foot Husum Falls on Tuesday, according to ABC News.

But the force of the water was too much for two of the patrons, with one falling forward and knocking a man who wasn't properly holding a rope out of the raft.

The unidentified adventure seeker then hit his head as he was dragged down the river by the strong current.

Video captured by the tour company's cameras along the river showed Cole spring into action as the water raged around him.

He jumped head-first into the river and within seconds, pulled the man to a rocky embankment.

'It looks like it's happening really fast to other people,' Cole told ABC News. 'This is all slow motion for us.'

Cole, who has worked as a river guide for 25 years, said the man came to after a few minutes on the riverbank.

Dazed and confused, the man asked Cole where he was and how he got there.

'At first I thought he was one of the people who doesn’t respond well, just overwhelmed by what’s going on,' Cole said. 

'After I yelled to him a couple of times, I could tell he wasn’t turning over. He had his bell rung seriously.

'[He said] 'Where
am I and how did I get here?’'

'I told him, 
‘you ran a waterfall and we warned you not to do it,’ and he said, ‘but I
had fun.’ And at the end of the day he said he was coming back.'

According to zooraft.com, Cole 'ranks easily as one of the top 
five guides in the history of White Salmon River running in terms of 
number of clients served, number of runs down the river and number of 
years of professional service.'
