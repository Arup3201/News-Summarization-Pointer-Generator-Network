But the identity of the sporty pensioner remains a mystery.

Several
 Italian newspapers have put out an appeal to track down the elderly woman, and 
speculated that she was probably a keen player herself.

Bend It Like Beckham', referring to the film of the same name that stars
 a group of female football players.

All

granny) in the Italian press is that she is probably from the Italian 
capital Rome, where the video was filmed.
