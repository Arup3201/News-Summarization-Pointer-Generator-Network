Austerity chic fashion chain Primark and the budget supermarket Aldi yesterday revealed a sales boom as the cost of living squeeze shakes up the high street.

Sales at Primark were up 24per cent for the first half of its financial year, helped enormously by the appeal of its £5 denim shorts and £3 crop tops to teen girls.

While the figure at Aldi rose by 31.1per cent as middle income Britons traded down from major supermarkets in search of bargain wine, fresh coffee and even lobster.

Sales soaring: Primark saw a 24 per cent growth in sales in the first half of this year. The news sent shares in the parent company soaring 8 per cent today

The longest squeeze on living standards in a century, with price rises outpacing increases in incomes, has triggered a radical shift in shopping habits.

High streets are changing with the rise of the likes of Primark at the expense of established brands like Marks & Spencer and Next.

At the same time, Aldi, Lidl, and Poundland together with pawn shops and payday loan firms are thriving.

Primark’s skill has been in turning 
around the latest catwalk fashions and celebrity trends and offering 
budget versions in double-quick time.

Sales of its tiny denim shorts and 
cropped tops took off after being worn by the likes of American teen 
singers Carly Rae Jepson and Taylor Swift.

Now, virtually every teen girl in the 
nation can be seen tottering around in similar outfits, regardless of 
the rain and cold that have blighted the country.

Its other recent best-sellers include £9 satchels, £10 maxi skirts and a jewel collar dress at just £13.

Takings at the group during the first 
half of its financial year, which ended in March, were up by 24per cent 
to almost £2billion. This boosted profits by 55per cent to £238million.

The group opened 15 stores during this
period, taking the total to 257, while it is expanding both in the UK 
and overseas with plans for its first outlets in France.

Primark is owned by the giant food 
company, Associated British Foods, which owns famous brands such as 
Kingsmill, Ryvita and Twinings, as well as British Sugar.

It described the fashion chain’s 
performance as ‘exceptionally strong’, saying it had helped the group to
post a 25per cent increase in its pre-tax profits, taking them to 
£452million.

Success: Consumers have turned to Primark as they face a squeeze on living standards - and move away from established brands like M&S

Chairman Charles Sinclair said: ‘The 
Primark success story continues. Trading in the period was very strong, 
the profit margin was much improved, customers in continental Europe 
have taken enthusiastically to the Primark brand and there is very real 
momentum in the addition of selling space.’

Primark’s figures are in sharp 
contrast to M&S, where recent cold weather and weak consumer 
spending drove clothing and general merchandise sales down 3.8per cent 
in the first three months of the year.

Sales at Aldi are up by a remarkable 
31.1per cent in a year, according to retail analysts Kantar Worldpanel. 
At the same time, the figure are German-owned rival, Lidl, rose by 
10.1per cent.

Aldi is opening new outlets at the 
rate of two a month as Britons develop an appetite for its range of 
quality products at budget prices.

Sales success: Aldi saw sales grow 31.1 per cent in the first three months of the year as budget-conscious shoppers turn away from the big four supermarkets

It has based its advertising strategy 
on a claim that it is able to offer the same quality as big brands for 
the price supermarkets charge for value own-labels.

At the same time the group has made a 
conscious effort to attract middle income shoppers who have been forced 
to cut down on household spending.

Both Aldi and Lidl have a reputation 
for selling high quality wine at low prices. Also added to the mix are 
Aberdeen Angus steak, prize-winning champagne, freshly ground coffee, 
olive oil and parmesan cheese.

Both of these firms are now making a big effort to offer a wide range of fresh meat, vegetables and fruit.

Edward Garner, director at Kantar 
Worldpanel, said: ‘Aldi has set two records in the latest period, with 
its highest ever growth of 31.1per cent delivering a record market share
of 3.4per cent.

‘Pressure on household budgets is 
undoubtedly driving some of the growth at the discounters, but messages 
about quality are starting to resonate.

‘Lidl announced this week that it will
increase its fresh meat and poultry floor space by 50per cent within 
the year, and Aldi’s new ‘convenience’ store in Kilburn is a departure 
from its traditional edge-of-town offering.  

‘These changes are likely to appeal to
a new and different group of shoppers which will bolster the 
performance of the discounters even further.’

At the other end of the scale, 
Waitrose is also growing strongly with sales up 12per cent in a year. 
Its reputation for being careful about how it sources its food has won 
customers as a result of the horsemeat scandal.

M&S, which does more than any 
other retailer to police its suppliers, has also seen a rise in food 
sales of some four per cent.
