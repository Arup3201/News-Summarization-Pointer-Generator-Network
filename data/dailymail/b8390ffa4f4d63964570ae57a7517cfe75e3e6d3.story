'Bondi felt really right. When the lease was up on Woollahra, the opportunity to do Bondi came up and I thought, "ohhhh that sounds quite exciting".'

'Bondi has a great new energy about it. It's a lovely mixed-up crowd too which I really enjoy,' he said.

Granger moved from Melbourne to Sydney in the late 1980s and worked at the now closed La Passion De Fruit in Surry Hills as a waiter while he studied art.
