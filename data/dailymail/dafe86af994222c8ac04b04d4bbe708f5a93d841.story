A former air stewardess flying to London for her honeymoon screamed at British Airways cabin crew: 'I'm going to shoot you in the face,' after barricading herself inside a business class toilet. 

American Brie Ann Johnson, 35, was flying to Heathrow to join her musician husband and had been drinking wine in the exclusive Club World upper deck on the 747 plane on top of her anti-anxiety Zanax medication.

She received a suspended prison sentence after pleading guilty at Isleworth Crown Court on Thursday to being drunk on an aircraft and assaulting BA cabin crew staff Craig Stoner and David Shaw on August 3.

'Devastated and horrified': Brie Ann Johnson pictured with her husband who was not named in court

Prosecutor Miss Pamela Reiss told the court the trouble started ninety minutes into the New York to Heathrow flight and Mr Stoner, a member of the cabin crew, was called to the upper deck.

Miss Reiss said: 'Miss Johnson was inside a toilet and there was groaning and banging noises coming from inside and when the staff knocked on the door she would not unlock it.

'Mr Stoner decided to take the door off its hinges, but Miss Johnson put her back against it to stop him.'

Miss Johnson was travelling on board a flight from New York to Heathrow when the incident occurred

Other passengers were described as being noticeably upset as the door was eventually removed and Miss Johnson, whose eyes were glazed, shouted: 'F*** off. Get off me.'

Miss Reiss explained: 'She would not walk and was carried back to the galley and wet herself. The crew detected the smell of alcohol on her breath and urine on her clothes.

'She threatened that she was going to shoot them in the face and put her hand into her jeans pocket and pulled out her passport.

'She then kicked down on Mr Stoner's right shin then used her fist and made contact with his right eyebrow and he felt blood trickling down his face. He was cut.'

Regret: Miss Johnson's lawyer said the defendant had 'little, if any, memory of the incident', but was nervous and stressed when boarding and did not have anything to eat

Miss Reiss continued: 'She also kicked Mr Shaw, he was kicked on the shin and she did attempt to bite him and told him: 'I'm going to shoot you in the face.'

'At that point Mr Shaw said: 'Get the handcuffs.' 'Throughout the incident Miss Johnson was swearing all the time and upsetting her fellow passengers.

'When police officers arrived at Terminal Five to meet Miss Jonson she was clearly drunk.'

Miss Johnson's lawyer Miss Laura Hucknell said: 'This was meant to be her honeymoon with her husband. She is in the country with him, he's a musician performing in a London concert and they have rented a flat.

'She is devastated and horrified at her behaviour, particularly as she is a former cabin staff employee herself.

'She has little, if any, memory of the incident, but was nervous and stressed when boarding and did not have anything to eat.

'She is terrified of the prospect of going into custody and has not slept since.'

'Alarming and violent behaviour': Miss Johnson was sentenced to six months imprisonment, suspended for eighteen months, at Isleworth Crown Court

Judge Robin Johnson said: 'This was alarming and violent behaviour and violence in an airplane inevitably carries immediate imprisonment.

'By the skin of your teeth I have decided not to send you to prison.'

Johnson was sentenced to six months imprisonment, suspended for eighteen months, ordered to pay £2,000 compensation to Mr Stoner, £1,000 to Mr Shaw, £650 costs and an £80 victim surcharge.
