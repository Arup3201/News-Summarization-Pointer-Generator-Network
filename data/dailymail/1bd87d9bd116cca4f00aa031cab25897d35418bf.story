A first-time mother diagnosed with breast cancer while pregnant had to be induced a month early in order to have a mastectomy. 

Roisin Pelan, 32, was diagnosed with the disease when she was 35 weeks pregnant.

Surgery to remove the tumour - just days after baby Ivy was born - means she is now unable to breastfeed her baby daughter.

Roisin Pelan was diagnosed with breast cancer 35 weeks into her pregnancy and had to be induced a month early to undergo a mastectomy

While pregnancy doesn't trigger breast cancer, the hormonal changes in the body during pregnancy can accelerate its growth

Mrs Pelan, from Preston, Lancashire, said: 'I'm only 32 - I didn’t want to lose my breast or be ill when having a new baby.

'But I feel lucky now that I know it’s not spread. I am really positive now.'

The medical secretary was diagnosed with breast cancer just a week after finding a lump in her left breast.

She said: 'I was moisturising - as you do to avoid stretch marks - and I found a lump in my left breast. 

'Doctors told me there was a 50-60 per cent chance it was malignant - but within days they got me back in to say it was breast cancer.

'They were really good at reassuring me but the more time that went by, the  more I was thinking, what if it has spread?'

Ivy was born on June 19, weighing 6lb, 7oz, and her mother (with partner Michael) had surgery six days later

Chemotherapy after the surgery meant Mrs Pelan was unable to breastfeed baby Ivy

The news left Mrs Pelan and her partner, Michael Brown, 29, fearing the worst for their unborn child.

She said: 'All the way through the pregnancy I had been so excited - but when it came to it, I just wanted them to induce me.

'As awful as it sounds I just wanted the birth out of the way. It took all the excitement away. There was so much waiting, I couldn’t sleep or eat.

'I just wanted the breast off - I wanted the cancer out.'

Baby Ivy was born on June 19, weighing 6lb 7oz, and six days later her mother underwent a mastectomy. 

Mrs Pelan said: 'I had a meltdown after the mastectomy. I thought I might not be around, but I have to keep reminding myself how lucky I was.'

'My job means I had more knowledge of cancer than many people - and that’s not necessarily a good thing.'

Chemotherapy after the surgery meant she was also unable to breastfeed. 

She said: 'With the chemo I couldn’t breast feed - and I’ve only got one breast, so I was given a tablet to stop me producing any milk.

'Having the breast removed wasn’t my choice, but the only thing I have been thinking is "it’s hasn't spread".'

She is now fundraising for Cancer Research UK, and is having her head shaved at the weekend, before donating the hair to the Little Princess Trust.

Her partner Michael, an engineer, praised her determination throughout the ordeal. 'She’s been very brave, she’s brilliant.'
