He treated his 17 sons and daughters like cash cows – generating a staggering benefits income of £60,000 a year.

Yesterday, Mick Philpott remained shameless to the last.

The drug-taking layabout, who 
embodies everything that is wrong with the welfare state, was still 
smiling even after being convicted of killing six of his children.

Co-conspirators: Mick and Mairead Philpott appeared at a press conference (left) in a tearful ruse to appeal for information after the fire last year. They are pictured (right) on their wedding day in May 2003

Together with his wife Mairead and 
friend Paul Mosley, he plotted to set fire to the family home in an 
appalling attempt to frame Philpott’s former live-in lover Lisa Willis.

The deadly gamble was to save the six
 youngsters, blame Miss Willis, and win back custody of five children 
who had recently moved out of the cramped three-bedroom semi with her.

A bigger council house was also on 
the agenda.

As the cynical trio were found guilty at Nottingham Crown 
Court of manslaughter, Philpott’s sister-in-law, Bernadette Duffy, 
screamed: ‘You murdering b*******. I knew it from day one.’ 

Incredibly, the tragic Philpott 
chlldren were not being regularly monitored by social workers despite 
dangerous living conditions and their father’s notorious appearances on 
national television where he boasted of his sex-obsessed and 
benefits-funded lifestyle.

As an inquiry was launched into the case, it also emerged that:

Scorched: The charred landing reveals just how fierce the fire was when it ripped through the house

Ravaged: The petrol-fuelled blaze broke out in the hallway of the home where Philpott lived with wife Mairead, 31, and their own six children - all of whom perished as they slept

Yesterday Philpott, 56, shouted 
obscenities before saying ‘it’s not over yet’ moments after Mrs Justice 
Thirlwall asked for the verdicts to be received in silence ‘out of 
respect for the memories’ of the children he had killed.

But with typical arrogance, Philpott,
 who infamously appeared on the Jeremy Kyle Show to demand a bigger 
council house, crossed himself, waved and smiled as he was led away.

The court heard how Philpott lived 
with his wife, Miss Willis and their combined 11 children in his cramped
 three-bedroom council house in Allenton, Derby.

Doomed: Firefighters said the children would not have been able to survive the intense heat and thick smoke

Spread rapidly: From the moment the fire was set in the hallway, the flames would have surged up the uPVC front door, melting the plastic, and quickly progressed up the staircase, firefighters said

But he was left irate after Miss 
Willis, 29, became disillusioned with his ‘domineering behaviour’ and 
summoned the courage to escape the unconventional family home with her 
five children early last year.

That decision to leave, taking with 
her more than £1,000 a month in benefit payments, was the ‘catalyst for 
everything that was to follow’.

Miss Willis, a cleaner, was due to 
face Philpott at a custody hearing just hours after the blaze and 
Philpott became the ‘driving force’ of a heinous plan to set her up, the
 court heard.

He began telling friends she had 
threatened his home and his children, something he would ‘use in court 
to get his children back’.

Less than a fortnight before the fire, he reported to police that she had made a telephone threat to kill him.

Philpott calculated that a fire could 
also land him a new, bigger council house – something he had been 
demanding from the local authority ever since his notorious appearance 
on Jeremy Kyle in 2006.

No hope: Thick, black smoke would have quickly filled each of the rooms from floor to ceiling, rendering the six children (clockwise from top left) - Duwayne, 13, Jade, 10, John, nine, Jessie, six, Jayden, five, and Jack, eight - unconscious in minutes

Community in shock: Floral tributes adorn the pavement outside the house Philpott shared with Mairead in Allenton, Derby, after the fire on May 14 last year

On May 11 last year, after Philpott 
had a sordid sex session with his wife and Mosley on their home snooker 
table, the fire was lit, with the intention that the six children 
sleeping upstairs would be saved through an upstairs window, with 
Philpott both ‘the hero and the victim’.

But the idiotic plan went 
disastrously wrong. Too much petrol was used and the fire burned out of 
control – leaving Philpott unable to reach the children in temperatures 
approaching 1,000F.

Jade Philpott, ten, and brothers 
Duwayne, 13, John, nine, Jack, eight, Jesse, six and Jayden, five, all 
died of smoke inhalation.

After the fire, the brand of petrol 
which was discovered on the clothing of all three defendants was also 
found in the U-bend of the sink inside the house.

Petrol on Philpott’s clothing was 
also found inside the front door. He simply claimed that fuel was found 
because he had not washed for three months.

While his wife was seen to be distraught, Philpott was overheard afterwards saying: ‘It wasn’t meant to end like this.’

During a fortnight of surveillance at
 the hotel where they were put up by police in May, the couple were 
heard whispering about the case, with Philpott recorded telling his wife
 to ‘stick to your story’.

The couple were charged by police on 
May 30 in connection with the deaths and Mosley was arrested in the 
months afterwards, having told a friend the plan had been for him to 
rescue the children.

Police initially charged the trio 
with murder but downgraded this to manslaughter because while their 
actions were sickeningly reckless, the defendants had not intended to 
kill the six.

Yesterday Philpott’s sister, Dawn Bestwick, said his family believed ‘justice has been served’.

‘This past year has been a very 
difficult time for our family as we have had to come to terms with what 
Michael and Mairead and Paul Mosley have done,’ she said.

‘We can now attempt to move on and our six angels can rest in peace.’

Mick Philpott was raking in £60,000 a year as a result of his 'three-way relationship', police say.

The cash was paid to both Lisa WIllis and his wife Mairead, both part time cleaners, in working tax credits and child benefit for the total of 11 children they raised with Philpott.

Although he was not claiming any benefits himself, the five-figure sum was channeled straight into his bank account as he refused to let the women manage their own financial affairs.

During the trial, prosecutor Richard Latham QC said: 'Michael Philpott did not want to work. He just wanted a house full of kids and the benefit money that brings.' The last full-time job Philpott had was in 1991 as a bakery manager. Since then he has done odd jobs for cash, including running pub trips.

Mrs Philpott’s family said the 
children had been taken away in the ‘cruellest way imaginable by the 
very people who were supposed to love and protect them.’

Her sister Bernadette, who was ejected from the courtroom, said she was convinced of the Philpotts’ guilt from the outset.

Derbyshire Police said a serious case 
review will examine ‘Mairead’s role as a mother’ as well as the extent 
of any involvement social services may have had with the family.

Andrew Bunyan, of Derby City Council, 
said questions would be asked as to ‘whether there are immediate changes
 that need to be made to the way local services operate to safeguard 
children’.

‘The local safeguarding children board
 will review the work of the agencies involved, even if, as in this 
case, the children were not subject to child protection plans or legal 
orders,’ he added.

Derbyshire Assistant Chief Constable Steve Cotterill described the crimes as ‘an evil, stupid, shameful act’.

He added that Philpott’s erratic 
behaviour since the fire, including a ‘childlike performance’ at the 
infamous police press conference, has been nothing more than a ‘sham’.
