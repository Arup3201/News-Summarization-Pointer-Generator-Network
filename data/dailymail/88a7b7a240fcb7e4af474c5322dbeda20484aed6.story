A champion Fijian athlete has been killed in a gang shooting in Northern California just weeks before he was set to attend a Louisiana university on a track scholarship, friends and authorities said.

Roy Ravana Jr. and another man, Kevin Ohta, were shot on Monday in Sacramento County by two juveniles who opened fire with two handguns and a rifle on behalf of the Norteno street gang, prosecutors said.

Ohta, 21, is expected to survive, the Sacramento Bee reported.

The suspects, Elias Guevara, 17 and Rozco Gutierrez, 16, have been charged as adults with murder and attempted murder.

The teens were arraigned on Wednesday but did not enter pleas, said Shelly Orio, a spokeswoman for the Sacramento County district attorney's office. Deputies believe Guevara and Gutierrez are gang members, according to News10.

Ravana, 20, was shot dead on Monday afternoon at the corner of 48th Street and Baker Avenue in the troubled Fruitridge neighborhood of Sacramento County.

Sacramento Bee reported Guevara and Gutierrez allegedly used three guns – a .30 caliber carbine semi-automatic rifle, a 9 mm handgun and a .357 handgun – in the attack. Shell casings were found strewn across two blocks.

Friends and family of Ravana say they were not aware of his involvement in any criminal behavior.

Fiji's Prime Minister, Voreqe Bainimarama, called Ravana an innocent bystander and said he was a great athlete and wonderful role model.

'Many people dream of being given an opportunity to pursue success overseas,' the prime minister said in a statement.

'Roy was living that dream when he died. And many young Fijians, even those who didn't know him personally, will feel a sense of shock and loss at his passing.'

Ravana, 20, represented Fiji, an island nation in the South Pacific near New Zealand and Australia, in the heats of the 60-meter race at the 2012 International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) World Indoor Championships in Istanbul and later in the same year in the 400-meter race at the IAAF World Junior Championships in Barcelona, Spain. He was also a 400-meter hurdler.

He had been selected to represent Fiji at next month's Commonwealth Games in Glasgow.

Athletics Fiji President Jo Rodan Senior told Radio New Zealand International that Ravana's father was going to the U.S. ON Saturday to bring the body back to Fiji, and the funeral will be June 21 in Suva.

Ravana came to the United States two years ago and spent a year at Iowa Central Community College, according to the Bee.

He went to Sacramento, where he has extended family, to await final word on his college admission, said his friend, Ilene Lasaisamoa, 21.

She said a confirmation letter came about a month ago, and Ravana was planning to attend the University of Louisiana on a track and field scholarship in the fall: 'We considered him family.'
