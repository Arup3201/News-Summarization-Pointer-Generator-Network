A boss accused of sacking two women sales executives after they refused his demands for a treesome yesterday said it was not true because he is incapable of having sex.

Darren Scott has been taken to an employment tribunal by Diana Nicholl-Pierson, 24, and Anna Mazover, 29, who are seeking £100,000.

They claim he subjected them to sexual harassment during the month they worked at a publishing firm before they were both dismissed ‘without notice’.

There were clashes in the tribunal today as Darren Scott (left) accused Diana Nicholl-Pierson (centre) and Anna Mazover (right) of making up sexual harassment claims so they could cash in

But the 52-year-old said having a threesome would be his ‘worst nightmare’, because even with Viagra, he is unable to have sex.

The sales director told the hearing: ‘I can’t make love to my wife, I can’t make love to anyone.’

He
 added: ‘I haven’t felt like a real man in 12 years since I was 
diagnosed with type 2 diabetes as one of the symptoms is erectile 
dysfunction, which I suffer from.

‘My
 worst nightmare would be in a hotel room or my apartment with two 
women. When they took their clothes off, we started to get down to it, I
 would have a product that didn’t work. The embarrassment would be 
unbelievable.’

Mr 
Scott claimed that when Miss Mazover found out he preferred blondes she 
showed him ‘sexy images’ of her with blonde hair and ‘in lingerie and 
sexy poses’ on a website for glamour models.

He
 also said he had to warn Miss Nicholl-Pierson ‘several times about her 
inappropriate clothing, which included short skirts and low-cut tops’.

Mr
 Scott said he has a 42-year-old wife who is a ‘complete stunner’, 
adding: ‘My favourite breasts in the whole world that I love to touch as
 often as possible are my wife’s.’

Earlier
 yesterday, he told the Central London tribunal the women were 
‘street-wise girls’ who are ‘bent on making as much money out of the 
company as possible’.

In his statement read by the tribunal, Mr Scott wrote: 'I
 deny all the allegations against me and I feel very strongly that these
 claimants have acted dishonestly and maliciously.

'They clearly have conspired together
 to fabricate these claims in order to either get me the sack and/or try
 and save their jobs and/or simply try and make some money out of the 
company.

'I
 particularly resent the fact that they made a complaint to the police 
who found there was absolutely no evidence to support the allegations 
against me at all.'

He said they were ‘pretty useless’ and ‘poor performers’ who only made one sale 
between them at London-based publishing firm Entico Corporation, he 
said.

He said in his 
witness statement: ‘I have never been excited by Diana in any way. I 
have never in any way found her attractive...’

He added there was ‘no sexual attraction’ between him and Miss Mazover.

The case had to be briefly adjourned after a heated exchange between Mr Scott and the women’s solicitor.

Banging
 his fist on a desk, he told him: ‘Get yourselves some witnesses for the
 things you’re accusing me of and if you can’t p*** off.’

He
 said: ‘These claimants have acted dishonestly and maliciously. They 
clearly have conspired together to fabricate these claims in order to 
make some money.

‘Both 
these girls were out on the party circuit in Soho. They were both 
involved, from what I saw, in taking drugs and drinking to excess. There
 were rumours Miss Mazover was a part-time sex worker and Miss 
Nicholl-Pierson was going out with a drug dealer.’

Ms Nicholl-Pierson and Ms Mazover were both dismissed from the company last June, less than a month after they had started.

The accusations had caused problems in his marriage, he added.

Mr Scott told hearing that Ms Mazover had a poor record of punctuality, while Ms Nicholl-Pierson was 'simply unable to sell'.

He went on: 'Both claimants were actually pretty useless and they are not people we would have kept on in any event.'

In
 cross-examination, Mr McDonough, asked Mr 
Scott: 'Every single allegation that both of these women have made is 
100% true, isn't that right?'

The respondent replied: 'No, it's 100% false.'

In his statement, Mr Scott described 
the office as open-plan and said that if he had said 'anything remotely 
inappropriate' it would have been heard by 'numerous other people'.

On
 the alleged suggestion of a threesome with the women, Mr Scott wrote 
that he 'never invited them to my home or to take part in any sexual 
activity', and claimed 'the only way they can prosper is by selling 
regularly'.

He told the hearing he had employed 'at least 4,000 people' in what was a 'tough environment'. He added that some employees only last 'for a few weeks'.

Earlier in the hearing, Ms 
Nicholl-Pierson cried when Mr Scott's lawyer, Adam Gadd, put it to her 
that 'your whole case is a lie' and she had made the claims 'for money'.

She replied: 'I want justice. The way they treated me is completely unfair.'

She
 added: 'What do you expect me to do when I've got no money and I want 
justice. I've been sacked and I'm unemployed. I'm not walking away.'

Ms Nicholl-Pierson told the tribunal when she went to complain to the publishing firm's director, James Ramsey (pictured), he started crying

The claimant told the hearing that her former colleagues at the London-based company did not protect her.

'These
 men cowered behind their computers like idiots even though they have 
probably got children and wives,' she said. 'Do you think that is 
appropriate behaviour?'

Ms
 Nicholl-Pierson told the tribunal that she was not the only person at 
the company who believed there were issues with Mr Scott.

'A lot of people felt that Darren was perverted and strange. I think he knows this himself,' she said.

She said that when she went to complain to the publishing firm's director, James Ramsey, about Mr Scott’s behaviour, he started crying.

Describing
 the meeting, she added: 'He (Mr Ramsey) burst out crying. He (Mr 
Ramsey) didn’t protect me. He doesn’t protect women, he stays there 
crying and does nothing.'

The
 two women started at the London-based company in May last year - Ms 
Nicholl-Pierson on May 13, and Ms Mazover on May 20 - and they were 
dismissed on June 14.

Mr Scott denies all the allegations. The hearing continues.
