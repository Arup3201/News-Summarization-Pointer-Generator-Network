Brawl: Julia Kadioglu was apparently arrested but her lawyer said she did nothing wrong and is 'indignant she was even arrested'

An Olympic dressage champion has defended her future sister-in-law and friend of Prince William who was arrested in connection with a vicious bar brawl.

Till Bechtolsheimer was allegedly shoved by reveller Daniel Kurkowski after he accidentally bumped into him on the dancefloor.

Mr Bechtolsheimer’s girlfriend Julia Kadioglu is alleged to have retaliated by smashing a bottle of Stella Artois lager over Mr Kurkowski’s head, leaving him with a nasty gash.

Miss Kadioglu was apparently arrested and led 
away in handcuffs but her lawyer said she did nothing wrong and is 
‘indignant she was even arrested.’

The
 32-year-old is said to have been defending the honour of investment 
banker Mr Bechtolsheimer, who is the grandson of Karl-Heinz 
Kipp, the billionaire owner of the German department store chain Massa.

But today her soon-to-be sister-in-law Laura Tomlinson, who won a dressage gold medal for Britain at the 2012 Olympics, said Miss Kadioglu had been wrongly arrested.

She said: 'There was no incident with this guy. Julia has never seen him before — there was no exchange.

'What I find most worrying is this guy was never even asked to make a  formal statement. She was arrested just on this guy's word.

'It is a complete joke. Anyone who has ever met Julia knows it is a complete farce.'

The
 Kipp family are close friends of Prince William and The Duchess of 
Cambridge and last year the Royal couple attended the wedding in the 
Swiss Alps of Till’s sister Laura, who won a gold medal in dressage for 
Britain at the London 2012 Olympics.

The incident happened late on Saturday night - according to the criminal complaint filed at the Manhattan Criminal Court the assault took place at 4.15am on Sunday the 19th of January.

On its website the Dream Hotel says that the Electric Room, which is underneath the Dream Hotel, is designed by New York night life impresario Nur Khan.

It is described as an 'intimate room' for some 100 people with a 'distinct cool Britannia feel' with sofas that have the Union Flag on them and Banksy artwork on the walls.

The club was described by the New York
 Times as one of the 'toughest' doors in the city to get into because it
 is so exclusive and said that it came alive at 3am when it was 'teeming
 with women built for sunbathing in Sardinia and men who could invite 
them there'.

Cocktails 
such as the Twisted Monarch go for $18 and celebrities who have been 
known to hang out there include Mick Jagger and Courtney Love.

A
 spokesman for the NYPD told MailOnline that officers from the 10th 
precinct in Manhattan arrived 15 minutes after the incident and arrested
 Miss Kadioglu.

The 
spokesman said that it did not appear that Mr Kurkowski was taken to 
hospital because of his injuries and was apparently treated at the 
scene.

He said: ‘It seems like a dispute in a bar and the young lady decided to involve a glass bottle’.

According
 to the criminal complaint Miss Kadioglu did ‘strike Mr Kurkowski about 
the back of his head with a green glass Stella Artois beer bottle, 
causing Mr Kurkowski to sustain a laceration and bleeding to the back of
 his head, and also causing him to suffer substantial pain’.

She has been charged with second degree assault for the alleged attack with a ‘dangerous instrument’.

Calls to Mr Bechtolsheimer at his office and to Mr Yu went unreturned.

banker Mr Bechtolsheimer, whose sister Laura is pictured on her wedding day last year. Till is the grandson of billionaire Karl-Heinz

Miss
 Kadioglu, who is British, attended St Andrews University at the same 
time as Prince William and the Duchess of Cambridge, though it is not 
clear if they knew each other.

She
 appears to have moved to New York recently and is working as a vice 
president of the derivatives and structured products arm of HSBC.

According to her Facebook page, Miss Kadioglu is a keen runner and fitness fanatic and appears to have competed in a number of triathlons.

She also has attended a number of society events in Manhattan.

Mr Bechtolsheimer is boss of Arosa Capital Management, his own investment company, and lives in New York.

The row that led to his girlfriend’s 
arrest is said to have taken place in the Electric Room nightclub in the
 Dream Hotel in the Meatpacking district on January 19, a Sunday night
