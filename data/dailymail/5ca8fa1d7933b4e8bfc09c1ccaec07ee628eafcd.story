This is the moment, caught on CCTV that a man stormed into a busy supermarket and held a gun to the head of a terrified member of staff - as a joke. 

Dimitrius Tihanovs, 27, said he saw himself as a 'Latvian James Bond or Starsky and Hutch' when he entered the store brandishing the gun, which only he knew was fake. 

A court heard he then returned to the store a couple of hours later and was spotted concealing a packet of pistachio nuts down his trousers. 

He then assaulted a security staff and threw the nuts on the floor before he was arrested.

Tihanovs admitted theft and assault and was found guilty of a firearms charge following a trial and has now been jailed for a total of 18 months. 

Peterborough Crown Court heard how he terrified a shop worker by holding the weapon to his head - which later turned out the be an empty BB gun.

Charles Kellett, prosecuting, said: 'He could feel it was cold. Tihanovs said ‘have you got some money?’ He thought the gun was real.

'He felt scared and pulled his head away. The man said ‘I’m only joking’ and he hugged him.'

Tihanovs, from Peterborough, Cambs., terrified staff and shoppers with the ball bearing gun at Asda, in Rivergate, Peterborough, in the store on March 31.

The court heard he concealed the firearm in the small of his back as he entered the supermarket about 11.45am, having carried it openly near the store’s entrance.

He approached a number of workers in various parts of the store and pointed the gun at them and shoppers.

Tihanovs showed a security guard the firearm, saying the gun was not real and he was “only messing about.”

He cocked and fired the gun two or three times, showing it was empty and left after kissing the guard’s hand.

He returned to the store at 2.30pm to steal some peanuts and then assaulted a security guard as he was arrested.

Charles Falk, defending, described Tihanovs’ actions as a “stupid, ill-thought-out joke with no element of hostility.” 

He told the court Tihanovs had thought of himself as 'some sort of Latvian James Bond or Starsky and Hutch' and his actions were intended to be a game.

Mr Falk said: 'This was a drunken, oafish, short-lived piece of idiocy where a defendant in drink took temporary leave of all judgment and sanity.'

Tihanovs was jailed for 17 months for possession of an imitation firearm with intent to cause fear of violence, one month consecutively for theft and one month concurrently for assault at Peterborough Crown Court.

Sgt Nikki Hall, of Cambridgeshire Constabulary, said: 'This kind of behaviour is not acceptable and will not be tolerated.

'It must have been terrifying for the shoppers and staff who had no idea if it was real or not. 

'Anyone who uses such weapons to scare or threaten others faces being put before the courts and ultimately jailed.'
