This little piggy will never find himself inside a Hawaiian imu.

Kamapua'a, or Kama for short, is a surfing pig professional who can balance on a board and ride out wipe-outs with class, to the wonder of beach-goers.

He's so good that Costco gives him free surfboards and his devoted owner, Kai Holt, has promised never to cook him in an imu, a Hawaiian underground oven.

'I think he enjoys it, you know. He really gets off on it. It seems like he has a good time out there,' Holt told Hawaii News Now.

'You know surfing is Hawaii's gift to 
the world. It's like true happiness, you know, that's what
 this guy does. Everywhere he goes he just makes people smile and 
laugh. He just brings joy to the world.'

Little Kama's surfing adventures began a few months ago when he stumbled into the Holt family's cabana at Bellows Beach.

They took the abandoned piggy home and discovered he could swim when he fell into the backyard swimming pool.

'I had no idea pigs could swim,' Holt said.

It wasn't long before Holt and his son Braiden took Kama to Sandy Beach and the four-legged waterbaby was jumping onto Holt's standup paddle board.

'It's funny when there's a big wave and a bump coming and he launches into the air,' Braiden said.

'I think he's gonna drown, but he just pops right up out of the foam.'

Holt and Kama's bond is so close, they go everywhere together and even sleep in the same bed.

'As long as he lives, he's not gonna see a dinner plate, that's for sure,' Holt said. 'He wont see the inside of an imu.'

The black pig has become such a pro, he is sponsored.

He gets free boards from Costco, clothes from Local Motion and received a Go 
Pro camera from the Bike Factory.

He even has his own Instagram account, kamapighi, where he keeps his more than 940 followers up-to-date on his adventures.
