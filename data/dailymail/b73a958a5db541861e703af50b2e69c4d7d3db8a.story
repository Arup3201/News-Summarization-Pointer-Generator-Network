Washington Redskins owner Dan Snyder sparked even more outrage over his team's name on Sunday when he invited the president of the largest Native American reservation to sit in his box at a game against the Arizona Cardinals.

Outgoing Navajo Nation President Ben Shelly and his wife Martha even wore Redskins hats to rub elbows with Snyder, amid intense public debate over whether the D.C. team should be allowed to keep its name, which many civil rights groups have deemed insensitive and racist towards Native American people. 

Shelly, however, is  not the most convincing Native American ally  as he does not have an overwhelming support from his tribe.In August he finished seventh in the presidential primary elections, and will be exiting office on January 14.

Snyder is currently in a legal battle with the U.S. Patent office, which cancelled the Redskins team name last June. Snyder has vowed never to change the name - saying it actually honors the legacy of American Indians.

Nevertheless, a group of about 100 people gathered before Sunday game to protest the name, holding up signs reading 'Game Over Racism' and 'Snyder can't buy my support'. 

Bringing Shelly into the box was Snyder's latest attempt to kill the controversy by proving he has support in the Native American community. 

The Navajo Nation includes 27,000 square miles of land in Arizona, Utah and New Mexico - making it the largest Native American reservation in the United States. 

'The Washington Redskins are proud to have President Ben Shelly and the Navajos along with Zuni and other Western region tribes that joined the us at the game today,' Redskins team spokesman Tony Wyllie said.  'This is representative of the support we have among Native Americans nationwide.'

Team player: Many civil rights and Native American groups have called for Snyder to change his team's name, saying the continued use of the term Redskins is insensitive and racist. Above, Shelly even wore a Redskins hat to the Sunday game 

Lame duck: Shelly is not exactly popular among his own people. He came in seventh in the Nation's August presidential primary election and will be vacating the position he's held since 2011 in January. Pictured above with his wife Martha at Sunday's game 

Shelly was allegedly attending the game to discus an NFL franchising agreement involving Navajo artists with Snyder, his spokesman Desmood Tome said. 

Tome says the issues of Navajo education and job creation take 'far more precedence' than the mascot name. 

Last year, Shelly weighed in the controversial topic, issuing a statement via his spokesman who said not everyone finds the term is negative.

'We’ve always been proud of a lot of individuality,' spokesman Erny Zah said. 'If they (Navajo) want to assert themselves as Redskins and the community is fine with that, they are going to continue.'

Racist: A group of about 100 came out to protest the Redskins name before the Sunday game against the Cardinals 

In fact, one Navajo Nation high school has the Redskins mascot. Red Mesa High School is one of three high schools in the U.S. to use the mascot, and is one of two in that count that are majority-Native American.  

'Native approved': This man spotted at Sunday's game proves that Shelly isn't the only Native American not offended by the Redskins name

But Zah added that the term should be avoided outside American Indian communities due to 'the legacy of negativity that the term has created'. 

Shelly's decision to back Snyder makes him a minority in his tribe, which voted last April to formally oppose the Redskins name, 9-2.

 

Shelly has faced controversy ever since he entered office in 2011, when he was accused of stealing thousands of dollars from the tribe to benefit himself and his family members. 

Those charges were eventually dropped when Shelly agreed to pay back the $8,250 he was accused of taking.

He also went behind tribal leaders backs to partner with Snyder previously, to sponsor a golf tournament with the NFL team owner's Original Americans Foundation (OAF). 

When other Native American groups found out about OAF's sponsorship the day before the event, a few pulled out. 

OAF also reached a sponsorship agreement with the Navajo Nation's radio station, which led to widespread protesting in the southwestern reservation.

While many Native Americans consider the term Redskins to be slur, public opinion polls show that the majority of Americans support the Washington team keeping their name. 

Loss: The Cardinals beat the Redskins 30 - 20 at the game held Sunday at University of Phoenix field in Glendale, Arizona

Cancelled: Snyder is currently in a legal battle with the U.S. Patent Office which cancelled his trademark last June. The legal battle is ongoing and Snyder is able to keep the name in the meantime

According to a poll conducted this year, 71 per cent of Americans back the name.  

This past June, the U.S. Patent and Trademark office cancelled the Redskins team name for a second time, saying it was 'disparaging to Native Americans'. 

But Snyder has vowed never to change the name, and in August his lawyers have filed an appeal against the ruling. In the meantime, the team will be able to keep their name. 

They plan to argue the first amendment right to freedom of expression.
