Deputy council leader Myfanwy Alexander has resigned in disgrace after using the N-word during a meeting

A deputy council leader has resigned in disgrace after using the N-word during a meeting.

Myfanwy Alexander uttered the derogatory term during a debate on cross-border health services between England and Wales.

In a shocking rant, the Powys county councillor complained: ‘We are treated like n****** over the border.’

She initially refused to step down, claiming the language she used was intended to ‘fight prejudice and unequal treatment’.

But her position became untenable after opposition councillors – whose support is needed for the minority group of Independents to run the authority - threatened to call a vote of no confidence.

Cllr Alexander, 52, delivered a bitter parting shot to her colleagues in her resignation letter, accusing them of lacking ‘loyalty’.

‘This matter appears to be feeding the toxic nature of division within the county council. It has been made clear to me that I cannot remain on the cabinet,’ she wrote.

‘I am not a racist and I believe that by resigning I am accepting a slur on my character which is entirely untrue.

‘My resignation has not been tendered without pressure and I would have expected to encounter more loyalty.

‘It is, alas, a situation which has to be resolved and you are of the opinion that I should resign.’

She also used her Twitter account to blast the ‘venom of parish pump politics’.

The row began on July 29 when Cllr Alexander, an Independent responsible for education and children’s services, complained to a cabinet meeting about some patients’ treatment when they travelled to Shropshire for healthcare.

She described how her name and that of a constituent had been dismissed as a ‘meaningless jumble of letters’ by NHS staff in England.

She then asked fellow councillors what they thought would have happened if her constituent had been called Ranjit and had tried to access healthcare outside Wales.

‘We are treated like n****** over the border. Our language and culture is trampled on and it’s a very sensitive issue,’ she added.

‘It’s not our fault that we don’t have a district general hospital to go to.’

Cllr Alexander went on to talk about another occasion when she asked if a Welsh-speaking nurse could say good morning to her father during a stay in hospital.

She claimed she was told: ‘That’s fine as long as you don’t mind your father being considered to be racist.’

A special meeting was arranged the following day to decide what action to take.

Council leader Barry Thomas said afterwards his deputy had been ‘severely reprimanded’ and referred for equality training but would be allowed to keep her job.

He said she had used the offensive word because she was ‘referring to Maya Angelou’s description of unfair health treatment in the Southern States of America and that no offence was intended.

‘She said she used the vivid language as a way of fighting prejudice and unequal treatment.’

The comments are said to refer to Angelou’s first autobiography, I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings, released in 1969.

The African-American author, who dealt with themes including racism, died earlier this year.

But Cllr Alexander, who lives with her four daughters in a £250,000 16th century cottage in Llanfair Caereinion, near Welshpool, tendered her resignation as anger grew among colleagues.

Fellow councillor Stephen Hayes said: ‘Her comments, made in a meeting open to the public, show a desperate failure to understand what is appropriate behaviour and language for someone holding public office.’

Welsh Conservatives leader Aled Davies said she had ‘stepped over the line’.

A council spokesman said Cllr Alexander would continue representing the Banwy ward.
