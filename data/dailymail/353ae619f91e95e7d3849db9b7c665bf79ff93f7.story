Step aside Tesco, Argos and Aldi, the world's cheapest tablet costing just £29.99 is now available in the UK.

The 7-inch UbiSlate 7Ci runs the 2011 Android Ice Cream Sandwich software and comes with just 4GB of storage, although this can be expanded up to 32GB using a microSD card.

Its price makes it £50 cheaper than Aldi's Lifetab, £70 cheaper than Argos' MyTablet and almost £90 cheaper than the Hudl by Tesco.

The 7-inch UbiSlate 7Ci, pictured, from London-based firm Datawind costs £29.99. It runs Android Ice Cream Sandwich and comes with 4GB of storage. The device was originally built for universities and colleges in India, but proved so popular the company decided to sell it to other regions

Developed by London-based Datawind, the 
7-inch tablet was initially built for use in universities and c colleges in India, but it proved so successful it has been made 
available in other regions.

Other specifications include a Cortex A8 1GHz processor, and built-in games and education apps.

It is the latest in a line of budget tablets that have been launched ahead of Christmas.

After Apple dominated the tablet 
market for years, Google was the first major company to challenge the 
iPad and, in particular, the later iPad mini with the launch of its 
Nexus 7 by Asus in 2012.

It 
was a budget tablet that went on sale for £159, compared to the iPad 
mini's £269, without compromising on the majority of features.

The
 search giant launched a Nexus 7 successor earlier this year that cost 
£199 and came with the world's highest resolution screen.

Tesco then took it a step further with the launch of its Hudl tablet.

The UbiSlate 7Ci is £50 cheaper than Aldi's Lifetab tablet that went on sale earlier this month. People queued for hours in London, pictured, to get their hands on the budget device

The 7-inch Hudl costs just £119 and beats the majority of other budget tablets in terms of screen pixel density.

It can even be bought for as little as £60 when purchased with Clubcard vouchers. 

At the launch, Tesco insisted it had not cut corners to 
produce the budget tablet and claimed it would beat similarly priced 
competitors ‘hands down’.

Datawind's tablet is the latest cut-price device to go on sale in the run up to Christmas. Argos recently launched is 7-inch MyTablet, pictured, for £99.99. It runs Google's Android Jelly Bean and has 8GB of memory

Argos then followed suit with its £99 MyTablet, before Aldi undercut them both with its £79 Lifetab earlier this month.

Amazon has also recently refreshed its Kindle range, dropping the price of the Kindle Fire HD down to £119

'With recent ONS figures showing that
 in the UK, 29 per cent of the poorest households have no computer and 
36 per cent no internet, we’re working to bring affordable technology to
 the hundreds of thousands of households excluded from the digital 
revolution', said Datawind’s chief executive Suneet Singh Tuli.
