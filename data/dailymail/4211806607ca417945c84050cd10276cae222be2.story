Diafra Sakho has revealed his debt to West Ham co-chairman David Sullivan.

The 24-year-old has proved an instant hit in the Premier League after joining from Metz for £4.5million in the summer and improved his reputation further on Sunday when he scored in the 2-0 win against Queens Park Rangers to make it five goals in five starts. 

However, his dream move to England nearly didn't happen after initial rejection by QPR and then West Ham pulling out of a loan deal as Sam Allardyce wrestled to find the right striker.

West Ham co-chairman David Sullivan insisted Sakho be signed despite the club having doubts

Yet co-chairman Sullivan took decisive action after being convinced Sakho was worth the gamble and it is beginning to pay off.

'I have always wanted to play in England and when West Ham came in for me in the summer, I thought that was it,' said Sakho. 'But then the deal began to fall through as I think the coach was having doubts and I was resigned to returning to France.

'Fortunately for me, Mr Sullivan stepped in and said he would be signing me and on a permanent deal. It was the chance I needed.'

QPR had the option of signing Sakho but chose not to and the striker made his point by scoring against them 

QPR's scouts in France had said Sakho wasn't good enough but that only made him more determined.

'I had heard QPR didn't want me so I wanted to prove I could do it. West Ham gave me the chance and now the coach Mr Allardyce believes in me too. I'm enjoying it and scoring goals against Liverpool and Manchester United shows I can play at this level. I'm just glad Mr Sullivan put his trust in me.'
