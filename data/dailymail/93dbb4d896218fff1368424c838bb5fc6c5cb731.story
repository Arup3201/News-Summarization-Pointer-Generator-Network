A 911 dispatcher who told a 13-year-old girl to 'stop whining' as her father lay dying in a hit-and-run crash on a Maryland highway has been fired.

Anne Arundel County Fire Department spokesman Capt. Russ Davies said the dispatcher no longer works for the department. The dispatcher's name was not released.

The February 1 incident triggered an investigation after the dispatcher told the girl to stop whining. The 911 call came in after a car hit 38-year-old Rick Warrick of Washington and his fiancée as they changed a tire along the Baltimore-Washington Parkway.

Killed: Rick Warrick, 38, died after he and his fiancee were struck by a hit-and-run driver as they changed a tire on the hard shoulder of a Maryland highway February 1. His two children witnessed the tragedy

Warrick and his fiancée, Julia Pearce, 28, had been heading to dinner in Anne Arundel County, Maryland with Warrick's two children.

As the couple changed the tire on the hard shoulder, the youngsters watched in horror as a vehicle struck them and then sped away.

The teenage girl frantically called 911 for help.

'Can y'all please hurry up!' the teen begs the male operator in a recording of the call, NBC Washington reported.

The operator responds: 'Ma'am, stop yelling, I need a location.'

When the girl tells him that they're on I-295, he tells her 'that's a pretty long road'. Again, she urgently tells him that two people were struck.

'OK, let's stop whining. OK, let's stop whining. It's hard to understand you... two people were struck, correct?' the operator says on the recording.

When she tells him that the couple are lying on the ground not moving, he asks to talk to someone else - but she tells him that he'll be able to understand her little brother even less.

Eventually emergency responders reached the couple.

Scene: Warrick had managed to switch the front tire on the front of his car when he was hit February 1. When his daughter called 911 to get help, the male operator told her to stop whining

Warrick, a car salesman from Washington D.C., died at the scene.

His fiancee suffered two broken legs, a broken pelvis and a fractured skull and was taken to Baltimore's Shock Trauma Center for treatment. She was seriously injured, though her injuries were not life-threatening.

When quizzed by NBC Washington over the incident, Davies admitted that the operator had not used the best choice of words and should respond differently in the future.

'However, what he was attempting to do was to get her attention, to start ascertaining information from her,' Davis said. 'It was pretty clear at that point they didn't know where they were.'

Police and family members have pleaded for the driver who hit the couple to come forward.

Sgt. Lelani Woods told WJLA that the couple were completely on the shoulder of the roadway when they were hit. The car then fled.

The other vehicle has been recovered, and there is a person of interest, Woods told WBAL-TV last week. 

Pearce said she did not get a good look at the car.

'Truly, if you have a child, or any children, how would you feel if someone just ran over your child, killed your child, and just kept going?' said Charmaine Ferrell-Anthony, Warrick's mother.

'A hit and run, there's no excuse for it, when you can just stop right there.' 

She added: 'I think the right thing will be to do just to turn yourself in. Accidents happen and we understand. It was a tragic accident.' 

Anyone with information is urged to call 202-610-8737.
