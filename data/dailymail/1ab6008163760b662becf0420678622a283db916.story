A mysterious Tourette's-like illness, which appears to be spreading uncontrollably among teenage girls at a New York high school, has left doctors totally baffled.

So far 14 girls and one boy at Le Roy High School in New York have shown symptoms including facial tics, sores, involuntary twitching and uncontrollable verbal outbursts.

At first the bizarre outbreak was put down to mass-hysteria - a peculiar stress related condition which has been known to occasionally affect groups of girls. 

Mystery: 15 students at New York High School, many of them cheerleaders,
 have spontaneously begun showing signs of a Tourette's-like illness

The school then brought in brain specialist Dr Jennifer McVige who diagnosed an illness called conversion disorder which can cause symptoms similar to those caused by Tourette's such as partial loss of muscle function, paralysis and speech problems.

Now leading environmental activist Erin Brockovich has been called in to investigate suggestions the youngsters may have been poisoned by a chemical spill.

Some parents have reported sightings of an orange substance oozing up through the soil onto the school playing fields.

On the case: Campaigning lawyer and environmental activist Erin Brockovich is investigating reports of an orange substance oozing onto the school playing fields

Brockovich, 51, famously played by Julia Roberts in the 2000 movie, believes the mysterious ooze may be the result of a chemical spill from a train derailment in the 1970s near the site of the school.

According to a 1999 report by the 
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, almost one tonne of cyanide 
crystals spilled to the ground in the derailment, along with 130,000 
litres of trichloroethene.

The crystals were removed but the trichloroethene was absorbed into the ground.

In 1996, Brokovich fought and won a mass lawsuit for an estimated $333 million dollars against Pacific Gas and Electric, who allegedly contaminated drinking water in the town of Hinkley, California.

She claims to have received more
 than one hundred emails about the school and has now sent a team of 
scientists to collect soil samples.

She
 said: 'There are reports from parents that at the atheletic field where
 all the children have been there is an orange yellow substance oozing 
up from the ground.

'When
 I read reports like this that the New York Department of Health and 
state agencies were well-aware of the spill and you don’t do water 
testing or vapor extraction tests, you don’t have an all-clear.

'We don’t have all the answers, but we 
are suspicious. They have not ruled everything out yet. The community 
asked us to help, and this is what we do.'

One victim 17-year-old Chelsey Dumars, 
described how she can't stop her arm swinging across her face and 
suffers uncontrollable face twitches.

She said: 'I started twitching constantly. Sometimes it gets me to the point I want to cry from twitching so much.

'I don't like even going into stores any more  because I feel like people are staring at me.

Unexplained: The teenagers, mostly girls, have developed tics and seizures. The majority of sufferers attend Le Roy High School

Another victim 16-year-old Traci Leunbar added: 'A lot of people say we are faking it .

'I'd like to see anyone do what we do 24 hours a day and try to fake that. If I could stop I would. I would love to.'

School administrators would not disclose exactly what they think has caused the outbreak but insist it is not a case of mass hysteria and that none of the girls are making the illness or symptoms up.

Earlier this month, the school held a forum for concerned parents. About 150 people attended, demanding to know what was wrong with the students.

Expert: Dr Greg Young, with the NYS Department of Health, said he is unable to disclose what the cause of the symptoms are due to privacy laws

Dr
 Greg Young, with the NYS Department of Health, said: 'I can assure you 
these children have all been seen by professionals that have come up 
with answers and they are all being treated and they're actually doing 
pretty well.'

Dr Young revealed 
that tics like this can be caused by a number of factors such as 
genetics, head trauma, drugs for ADHD and OCD and antihistamines.

Through
 tests over the last few months, they have been able to rule out a 
number of environmental factors, infections, illegal drugs and carbon 
monoxide poisoning.

But Brockovitch believes New York 
officials might have prematurely ruled out environmental reasons for the
 teens having neurological symptoms.

According to WGRZ.com, the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta
 has been consulted, along with Columbia University, as well as the 
Genesee County Health Department and the New York State Health 
Department.

Dr Young assured parents that these cases have been seen nationwide and they come and go in individuals.

Tourette's
 syndrome affects the body's brain and nervous system by causing tics - 
repeated, uncontrollable movements or involuntary vocal sounds.

Strangely two other girls who attend a 
school in Corinth, Saratoga County, around 250 miles away, have reported
 the same symptoms.
