The alleged assault took place at the Red Lobster restaurant in Fairview Heights, Illinois, on Friday

According to a witness, the attack 
was sparked when the women became irritated that the waitress was 
filling up their water glasses too often.

She refused medical treatment from an ambulance crew.

Bail for each of the three women, who have been charged with mob action and aggravated battery in a public place, has been set at $50,000.

They remain in police custody until their arraignment, reports CBS St Louis.

Previous incident: Four patrons attacked a server at the same Red Lobster restaurant in December after they were given the wrong meals

The incident comes just eight months after another waitress was attacked by four customers at the same Red Lobster restaurant.

In that assault, the server suffered a swollen eye and cuts to her nose and forehead.

Ania D Wilkes, 20, of Ferguson, Missouri, was charged with aggravated battery and mob action charges in that case.

Police said she and three others punched and pushed their server when the wrong orders came to their table.
