The mother of conjoined twins born with one body and two heads has described how her 11-day old daughters are already showing 'very separate' personalities.

'You have to see it to believe it,' Renee Young told Woman's Day, 'sometimes Faith will cry and wake Hope up, who then looks sideways as if to say, "Thanks for that".

'We are blessed we've got this far. I just find them adorable.'

The girls' father, Simon Howie, said he was amazed at the progress the girls have made in hospital since their birth on May 8.

'Each time I come means they've reached another milestone and pulled through another day,' he said.

The babies, Faith and Hope, were christened at Westmead Children's Hospital after their miraculous birth on May 8. 

'I think they're beautiful and Simon thinks they're beautiful, so really, that's all that matters,' Ms Young told A Current Affair.

Two girls in one body: Renee Young with her daughters Faith and Hope who were born in a Sydney hospital on May 8

Faith and Hope were born with a rare condition called diprosopus, which means they share the same body and organs but have separate brains and two faces

Proud mother: Faith and Hope are now in a stable condition and breathing without support, after initial doubts

They continue to defy medical odds and Ms Young and Mr Howie have maintained a bedside vigil for their daughters who were born with identical faces and two brains.

Despite doctors initially telling the couple to terminate the pregnancy, they have been told the girls have a strong chance if they survive the next five weeks.

The girls were born with a rare condition called diprosopus, which means they share the same body and vital organs but have their own faces and brains which are connected by only one brain stem.

'Even though there is only one body, we call them our twins. To us, they are our girls and we love them,' Mr Howie told Woman's Day.  

'We have no idea how long they will be in hospital. We just want to bring them home, happy and healthy to make our family a little bit bigger and a bit more chaotic.'

'I think they're beautiful and Simon thinks they're beautiful so really that's all that matters,' their mother said.

As the parents of seven other children, Renee and her husband Simon Howie never considered terminating while the girls grew healthy

The condition is so rare that only 35 cases have ever been recorded and none have survived.

Due to the complex nature of Faith and Hope's condition, doctors are unsure about what to expect and they are being forced to make their prognoses day by day.

Mr Howie confirmed that specialists were called in to decipher a range of problems and assess the twins in great depth, from the functioning of their lungs and blood vessels to decisions about how best to proceed with feeding.

But despite all the forewarned medial problems likely to come their way, Ms Young and Mr Howie are happy their girls are alive and well.

'I think they're beautiful and Simon thinks they're beautiful so really that's all that matters,' Ms Young told A Current Affair.

Mr Howie said: 'I sort of don't believe in terminating the baby if it's healthy and growing fine and everything is going to plan'

Their mother Renee gave birth to the girls via an emergency caesarean

Their condition is so rare that only 35 cases have ever been recorded and none have survived

From as early as 28 weeks into Ms Young’s pregnancy, specialists were concerned about grave developmental issues.

One of the biggest predicted survival risks from their doctor Greg Kesby was that the babies would be unable to breathe on their own.

The couple, who are parents to seven other children, were also told early on in the pregnancy not to keep the child ‘because it would be looked upon by the public as a freak’.

They defied the doctors because Ms Young had never terminated a pregnancy and because they had a family 'that gives us a lot of support'.

At first, things looked to be taking a turn for the worst as Ms Young unexpectedly went into labour at only 32 weeks on May 8, and was forced to have an emergency caesarean.

The couple refused to terminate their unborn twins despite being warned by doctors of the medical and social problems the girls were likely to suffer

The twin girls were not breathing in the first few moments after their birth, leaving their parents in a state of great anxiety

The girls have defied all odds and are currently in a stable condition and breathing without any assistance.

Although the couple were aware from the early stages of pregnancy that their children would have great developmental problems, they said that while they continued to grow healthily, they couldn’t come to terms with letting their unborn twins go.

'We sort of looked at it as; it'd be the same as being a child with autism or Down syndrome. I sort of don't believe in terminating the baby if it's healthy and growing fine and everything is going to plan,' Mr Howie said.

The proud parents of the small survivors have braced themselves for a difficult path ahead and refuse to say goodbye prematurely.

'I would say, if I only get two days with the baby, I only get two days with the baby - at least I have some time with it,' Ms Young said.
