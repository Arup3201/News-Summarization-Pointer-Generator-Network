The world's last surviving First World War veteran has died - marking the end of an era in British history.

Florence Green, who joined the war effort in September 1918, when she was aged just 17, passed away in her sleep at a Norfolk care home just two weeks before her 111th birthday.

The great-grandmother, who lived through all but 400 days of the 20th century,  signed up to the Women's Royal Air Force two months before the end of the First World War.

She was the last surviving person to 
have seen active service in the Great War following the death of British-born 
sailor Claude Choules in Australia last year.

Mrs Green, who was born in London, worked at Narborough Airfield and RAF Marham, Norfolk, as an Officer's Mess steward.

Florence spent her war days working 
'all hours' serving officers their meals. And she would often
spend time wandering the base simply 'admiring the pilots', she admitted..

Before
her death she said: 'I enjoyed my time in the WRAF. There were plenty 
of people at the airfields where I worked and they were all very good 
company.

'I would work 
every hour God sent but I had dozens of friends on the base and we had a
great deal of fun in our spare time. In many ways I had the time of my 
life.

'I met dozens of pilots and would go on dates. I had the opportunity to go up in one of the planes but I was scared of flying. It was a lovely experience and I'm very proud.'

In later life she lived with her daughter May, 90, in King's Lynn, Norfolk, but had moved into Briar House care home shortly before Christmas where she died on Saturday.

Her proud family today paid tribute to the veteran, describing her as 'a great woman'.

May said: 'She so nearly made it to her 111th birthday. It is very sad. We are grateful for all the nice tributes.'

Mrs Green's younger daughter June Evetts, from Oundle, Northamptonshire, 76, said: 'I'm very proud of her and she was very proud of the recognition she received.'

Her amazing story came to light after Andrew Holmes, a British correspondent for the US-based Gerontology Research Group, traced her name using the National Archive.

Mr Holmes tracks and validates the ages of people over 110 and also keeps track of British men and women who are older than 107.

He was stunned to locate a service record on the National Archive for Florence Beatrice Patterson, Mrs Green's maiden name.

Mr Holmes traced the records further and was surprised to find Florence had joined the WRAF in September 1918 - two months before the war ended on November 11, 1918.

He said: 'It's a common misconception that a veteran must be someone who saw action or fighting in the trenches.

'A veteran is someone who served in one of the Armed forces, regardless of their role - a medic, an ambulance driver or a waitress - they all count.

'Obviously the last surviving veterans of any war are likely to be the youngest and therefore would not have served long.'

He added: 'I am saddened by her death. 
Florence was the sixth oldest person in the UK and the only remaining 
WW1 veteran in the world.'

The original aim of the WRAF, which was set up as an auxiliary organisation of the Royal Air Force in 1918,  was to provide female mechanics to allow men to serve on the front line.

However, the organisation saw huge enrollment, with women volunteering for positions as drivers and mechanics and filling other wartime needs. This first WRAF was disbanded in 1920.

Last May the only living male First 
World War combat veteran, British-born sailor Claude Choules, died in 
Australia at the age of 110.

Britain's last survivor of the First World War trenches Harry Patch - known as 'The Last Tommy' - died in July 2009 aged 111.

RAF
Squadron Leader Paula Willmot yesterday said RAF Marham, where Florence
was stationed for seven months, would pay its respects to the veteran 
'in true style'.

She said: 'We will be supporting the family at the funeral. We are sending a number of our stewards as a tribute to her.

'We kept in contact with her and visited her just before Christmas to give her a Christmas cake, which she was delighted with.

'We were due to visit her on Friday to celebrate her 111th birthday. It is a very sad occasion, but what an amazing woman.

'She is very much a Norfolk lass. We have very good memories of her. RAF Marham will be paying its respects in true style.'

Florence celebrated her 110th birthday on February 19, last year with her daughter May, who was her full-time carer.

She is also survived by her son Bob, 86, who lives in Edinburgh, and four grandchildren and seven great-grandchildren.

She was married to husband Walter, a railway porter in 1920, for 50 years until his death in 1970.

Sian Taylor, deputy manager of Briar House care home in King's Lynn, Norfolk, said Mrs Green 'always had a smile on her face.'

She said: 'Florence came to us on November 23 last year. She was a lovely, very well-mannered woman and she always had a smile on her face.

'She was immobile, but would talk about the old days to the carers and other residents who would visit her in her room.

'A carer took her some water at 5am on Saturday and sadly found she had died in her sleep.'
