A mass grave has been uncovered underneath Florence’s world famous Uffizi Gallery.

In a discovery worthy of a Dan Brown novel, more than sixty skeletons have so far been unearthed, laid out head-to-toe, while archeologists believe that hundreds or thousands more may yet emerge.

The grave, which is thought to date back to the fourth or fifth century, a dark period in Florentine history when the city was in decline, was only discovered when construction workers began digging a new lift-shaft for the museum.

The crypt of corpses sits below the library of the celebrated museum, home to masterpieces such as Leonardo's Da Vinci's Adoration of the Magi and visited by millions of Britons every year.

Archeologists say the bodies bear no clear sign of malnutrition or violence, leading experts to believe they may have been victims of an early plague.

Soil samples indicate that they were buried simultaneously in groups of four or five with the bones of children placed between adults.

The manner of burial indicates a hasty interment showing a need to bury rapidly, each day, a large number of corpses, and need to optimise space during a fatal epidemic or plague when many more deaths were imminent.

The notorious Black Death, which wiped out two thirds of the population of Florence, did not arrive until the 14th century. But the skeletons could reveal the existence of an earlier pandemic that was equally lethal, experts said.

Archeology Superintendent for Tuscany Andrea Pessina said: ‘The remains which have been unearthed over the past five months bear no sign of trauma.

'We will conduct DNA and carbon-14 tests to determine the cause and time of death, as well as information on diet, pathologies, and work-related stresses at the time’.

A statement from the Ministry for Cultural Assets read: ‘The excavations in the area of the Levante of the Uffizi have yielded an exceptional discovery: An instant picture of a catastrophe of unimaginable proportions which hit Florence in the early medieval period.’

‘This catastrophe certainly contributed to the long period of decline in the city about which little is known, but perhaps this find alone will be enough to explain it.’

The theory of a massacre by a group of invading barbarians has been excluded because of the absence of traumatic wounds, the ministry said. Neither is there any sign of malnutrition.

The most likely cause of death was a fatal and highly contagious epidemic such as plague, cholera, dysentery or flu. Tests to be carried out on the bones and teeth should reveal such a pandemic.

The gallery are working with researchers from a specialist paleogenetic lab at the university of Mainz.

The bones will be carbon dated and photographed before being reburied in another area of Florence.
