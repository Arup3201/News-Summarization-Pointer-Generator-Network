Tom Willis might have been born without arms - but that isn't stopping him from being a Major League Baseball pitcher.

The 54-year-old lives his life by the mantra of 'No hands. No arms. No problem,' and he certainly showed that at the Kansas City Royals' Kauffman Stadium, throwing out the first pitch with his feet.

Willis is hoping to throw the first pitch at 30 Major League stadiums as part of his Pitch for Awareness campaign to draw attention to the amazing abilities of people with disabilities.

On the good foot: Willis was born without arms and hands and is traveling the country to promote the Pitch for Awareness campaign, hoping to draw awareness to the abilities of persons with disabilities

He explained to ThePostGame in 2011 just how he manages his astonishing foot-throw.

'Basically,
 I hold the ball with my right foot and step back with my left leg. Then
 I lift my left leg into a kick like a real pitcher does.

'I
 bring that leg down slowly and the right leg comes up. Using the 
momentum that I've created in my hips when I bring my left foot forward,
 I get an extra whip and just try to throw straight at the catcher with 
the ball coming from my right foot.

'Most times it gets there. It's similar to the same way people throw with their arms, but I do it with my legs and feet.'

Willis says his aim is to eventually throw the first pitch at all 30 MLB stadiums.

'I might not make it to 30, but I’ll have fun trying,' he told the Washington Post in 2012.

'My goal is to help people understand that when you look at a person who has a disability, it doesn’t mean that they don’t have a whole heck of a lot of abilities, including some that you can’t even imagine.'

He was born with congenital bilateral upper amputation, but takes his disability in his stride.

He can cook, drive, write - and throw out a first toss that's 'pretty amazing and better than most we've seen this season,' according to MLB.com.
