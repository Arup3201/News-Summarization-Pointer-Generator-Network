Stoke City defender Robert Huth insists players who cry should be handed a three-match ban after Luis Suarez broke down at full-time of Liverpool's 3-3 draw at Crystal Palace.

Having thrown away a three-goal lead, Suarez's Liverpool look to have lost nearly all hope of claiming their first league title in 24 years.

The Uruguayan covered his face with his shirt and was comforted by Steven Gerrard at full-time, after Liverpool had been 3-0 up with 12 minutes remaining.

Huth said on Twitter: 'Still maintain that crying on the pitch should warrant a 3 match ban.'

Having had the title race in their own hands just over a week ago, Liverpool now must rely on Manchester City losing one of their two remaining home games against Aston Villa and West Ham to win the Premier League.
