Jaeger is the ultimate high-end High Street brand — but hit trouble in 2012. Now, three years after facing bankruptcy, its booming again, with online sales up an incredible 78 per cent. Sandra Howard loves their clothes, but admits they’re too pricey to splurge on every time. So, could she get the classic Jaeger look for less? 

LAZY WEEKEND: JAEGER 

Long-line cardigan, £175

Silk blouse, £125

Skinny jeans, £89

Total spend: £389

Orangey colours are my thing, and the zingy colour of this cardigan is just fantastic. It really brightens my complexion. I also love the way it covers my bottom!

The material of the cardigan feels good quality, but is perhaps a little on the thin side. The shirt is soft and well-cut — although at this price, it should be. The jeans are a good colour and a great fit. 4/5

LAZY WEEKEND: CHEAP CHIC

Cashmilon cardigan, £28, Marks & Spencer

Blouse, £29.99, Zara

Skinny jeans, £7.99, H&M

Total spend: £65.98

This cardigan actually feels a bit thicker and softer than the Jaeger one, but I don’t like the way it’s longer at the back because it doesn’t hang so well.

This blouse would be fine for a 14-year-old — but at the grand old age of 74, I don’t think I can get away with it. The material is frankly ropey, the collar is too prissy and the cheap, gold buttons don’t help matters, either.

These jeans are fine, but they aren’t quite such a pretty colour or good fit as the Jaeger ones. Still, at £7.99 you can’t complain. 3/5

OUT TO DINNER: JAEGER

Cashmere sweater, £199 Leather skirt, £450

Total spend: £649

I’m not a huge fan of the cut of this skirt. It makes it look like a kilt — which is not what you want from a leather skirt.

The leather is butter-soft, and it certainly has a bit of va-va-voom. But the price! Cripes!

This jumper is beautifully cut, a great colour and it has interesting sleeves, but it bags slightly around the under arms, which is not ideal. 3/5

OUT TO DINNER: CHEAP CHIC 

Jumper, £19.99, Zara

Leather pencil skirt, £85, Oasis

Total spend: £104.99

This jumper feels a bit thin, and is not nearly as luxurious as the Jaeger one.

But I like the way it hangs. It’s casual and sexy, which is a great mix.

This skirt is two inches too long, but get it turned up and it’s a definite winner. 3/5

SUITS YOU, MADAM: JAEGER

Wool jacket, £199

Wool trousers, £150

Crew neck jumper, £125

Total spend: £474

You can really tell the quality of this. The grey, wool-rich jacket fits like a glove and is beautifully lined, so it would be warm and cosy at this time of year.

The cut of both the trousers and the jacket is perfect, the trousers sit comfortably on my waist and the jacket is shaped to enhance my figure — but, at this price, I would expect perfect tailoring. I also love the soft, blue knit underneath — the pale, spring colours flatter my complexion. 4/5

SUITS YOU, MADAM: CHEAP CHIC

Wool mix jacket, £65, and wool mix trousers, £45, Next 

Cashmilon jumper, £12.50, Marks & Spencer

Total spend: £122.50

This two-piece suit is a great option for the price — it looks almost exactly like the Jaeger version, but it is more than £200 cheaper! It doesn’t feel as luxurious, because the lining is not as sleek, but to look at I couldn’t tell the difference.

The jumper is also a real bargain — it is incredibly soft and I thought it was cashmere. I prefer the slightly brighter colour with this outfit, too. 5/5

SUNDAY BEST: JAEGER

Grosgrain jacket, £175

Cashmere breton sweater, £199 Leather pencil skirt, £350

Total spend: £724

I think Jaeger have made their classic mistake again with this jacket. It’s that little bit too staid. It’s too headmistressy for me and it’s two inches too long. The jumper is nice, though I think I could easily find something very similar cheaper elsewhere.

The skirt is well-made, and would be a versatile item in your wardrobe. It could be dressed down with a loose jumper and knee-high boots, or worn with a silk shirt for a glamorous look. But, at this price, you need to be certain you would get a lot of wear out of it. 3/5

SUNDAY BEST: CHEAP CHIC 

Navy jacket, £36, Debenhams Breton jumper, £29.50, Marks & Spencer

Leather-look skirt, £30, River Island

Total spend: £95.50

I much prefer this jacket, as it is a little shorter and looks more modern — at my age, it is important not to wear dated clothes.

This skirt isn’t as comfortable as the Jaeger version, but it has a sexier cut and looks just as expensive. The jumper is also lovely and comfortable. I love this outfit — it could easily pass as real Jaeger, but for a fraction of the price. 5/5

CITY SLICKER: JAEGER

Silk blouse, £125

Cotton chinos, £99

Total spend: £224

This is a lovely, fun outfit that I’m looking forward to wearing in the spring. The blouse feels very silky and lightweight, perfect for travelling.

The colour of the trousers is very unusual for Jaeger but I love them — it’s nice to try out something a little different, and they work well with the pale-pink shirt.

I worry this outfit would look very creased if I wore it for a whole day, though. 2/5

CITY SLICKER: CHEAP CHIC

Blouse, £35, and straight leg chinos, £25, Marks & Spencer

Total spend: £60

This version is much more affordable — the blouse fits well and looks just as good as the Jaeger one. I would much rather buy this.

The trousers also fit me better, and they are a more relaxed style. They would be more practical to wear during the daytime.

The washed-out colour of these trousers is also a bit more wearable. 4/5

DATE NIGHT: JAEGER 

Shift dress, £199

Silk print scarf, £99

Total spend: £298

I’m afraid the cap sleeves on this dress would be fine for a younger woman with beautifully toned arms — but are impossibly unflattering on an old lady like me.

The colour is great, though, and it fits nicely. I can imagine my husband Michael absolutely loving this dress, as it’s simple and shows off my figure.

I’m afraid the scarf is a teensy bit boring, though — the colours are too flat and it could really use a little extra oomph! 3/5

DATE NIGHT: CHEAP CHIC 

Shift dress, £25, bhs.co.uk

Printed scarf, £7.99, New Look

Total spend: £32.99

This dress is a bit more slouchy and much more me. It’s not as flattering on the figure as the Jaeger dress, but it feels less air-hostessy and a bit more relaxed. Crucially, the sleeves come down to the elbow.

The scarf is fine for the price. The colours are strong, and it makes for a more casual look.

To make it more glamorous, I would team this dress with a knock-out piece of jewellery. If you did that, I don’t think anyone would guess you had bought it for just £25. 4/5
