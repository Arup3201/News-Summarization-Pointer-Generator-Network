One of Britain’s leading chief constables faced calls to stand down last night amid a criminal probe into a bungled paedophile investigation.

Sir Peter Fahy, who heads Greater Manchester Police, is at the centre of an extraordinary inquiry into alleged crimes and gross misconduct.

He will be interviewed within weeks in relation to his role overseeing the surveillance of a suspected sex offender, which may have put a child in danger.

Sir Peter Fahy, chief constable of Greater Manchester Police, is one of three serving officers to be served with a criminal and gross misconduct notice following investigations by Independent Police Complaints Commission

His colleague Terry Sweeney, assistant chief constable, is also being investigated over the disposal of body parts belonging to victims of serial killer Harold Shipman.

Both inquiries were sparked by an internal whistleblower, who went to the independent police watchdog after the force dismissed his claims.

The decision to investigate Sir Peter was welcomed by Rochdale MP Simon Danczuk. The Labour politician has previously clashed with the force over the way it dealt with the sex offences of former Liberal MP Cyril Smith.

‘I have raised concerns for some time about the leadership of Greater Manchester Police in relation to how it tackles sexual abuse,’ he said.

‘With the chief constable now under investigation for what is a very serious matter, it is only right and proper that he is suspended until the inquiries are completed.’

The Independent Police Complaints Commission launched a wide-ranging inquiry into the Manchester force following the whistleblower’s claims.

Yesterday Sir Peter was one of four officers, one of whom has retired, told they were being investigated for criminal offences and gross misconduct regarding the paedophile investigation.  

Assistant Chief Constable Terry Sweeney is the officer served with a gross misconduct notice in relation to Shipman's victims.

The investigation is looking into whether police officers misled the families of Harold Shipman's victims over the disposal their loved ones' remains.

Human tissue from 12 of the serial killer's victims were kept for more than a decade by Greater Manchester Police before allegedly being secretly destroyed, without permission from their families.

The samples were taken from the 12 victims to ensure police had the appropriate evidence should Shipman or his family appeal against his conviction.

However, in 2011, police decided to 'respectfully dispose' of the tissue samples without telling the families of the victims.

The remains reportedly belonged to Kathleen Grundy, Joan Melia, Winifred Mellor, Bianka Pomfret, Ivy Lomas, Marie Quinn, Irene Turner, Jean Lilley, Muriel Grimshaw, Alice Kitchen, Elizabeth Mellor and Sally Ashworth.

In response to the allegations, made by a whistleblower currently working within the force, the IPCC launched the probe. 

IPCC investigators have obtained a volume of Greater Manchester Police documents relating to all three investigations, and interviewed the whistleblower.

A major incident room has also been set up and relatives of the victims of Shipman are being informed of progress, the IPCC said.

Greater Manchester Police today confirmed the chief constable was still 'in post', and the other serving officers remained on duty.  

Sir Peter said: 'As a chief constable, you face making complex decisions on a daily basis about many high-risk and challenging situations.

'It is right that this decision-making is scrutinised and that I am held to account as part of this investigation.'

The married father-of-four joined the police in 1981 and is now the head of one of the biggest police forces in the UK.

Prior to his current role, he worked as an assistant chief constable in Surrey, and had positions with Hertfordshire and West Midlands forces before joining Cheshire Constabulary as Chief Constable in 2002.

He took up his post at Greater Manchester Police on September 1, 2008, following the death of Michael Todd who was found dead in Snowdonia.

He was knighted in 2012 for his services to the force.

At the time, he said: 'You can't give a knighthood to a whole police force so it has been given to me as leader of such a hard working organisation.'

The IPCC probe was launched back in March but it is only today the officers have been served with criminal and gross misconduct notices.

Launching the investigation, IPCC commissioner Jan Williams said: 'These are serious allegations and the gravity and nature of the allegations, and the fact that they are made against senior officers within the force, means they must be investigated independently.

'We will also look at the wider organisational response by Greater Manchester Police in each of these investigations.

'We know that the families involved will have been through very distressing times, and we will be sensitive to this as we conduct our investigations.

'We have a statutory duty to conduct independent investigations in circumstances such as these, but we will make sure that we communicate with the families and do whatever we can to avoid further distress.' 

Sir Peter also appeared in court last month to plead not guilty over the police shooting of an unarmed man, Anthony Grainger, in 2012. His force is being prosecuted for allegedly breaching health and safety laws in relation to the incident.

Tony Lloyd, the Greater Manchester Police and Crime Commissioner, said he had no evidence to support suspending Sir Peter while the investigations take place but would keep his position ‘under review’.
