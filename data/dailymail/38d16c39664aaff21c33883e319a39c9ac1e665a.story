A two-year-old girl suffered serious head and leg injuries after she was attacked by a Rottweiler this morning.

The girl, who has not been named by police, was taken to Rotherham District General Hospital in South Yorkshire following the attack in the Rawmarsh area shortly before 10am.

Police confirmed this evening that her injuries are not life-threatening.

The attack happened on the day that the Government proposed plans to introduce life sentences for owners of killer dogs.

According to a South Yorkshire Police spokesman: 'The dog has been taken to a secure kennel facility while police enquiries continue into the circumstances surrounding the incident.'

Officers say that they are investigating the incident.

The dog is believed to be a pet belonging to the girl's family.

It was on a lead at the time of the attack and was being walked by the girl and an adult female relative.

The girl has been moved from the Rotherham hospital to a specialist children's unit in Sheffield.

She was attacked just hours after plans to increase the maximum sentence handed to owners of dogs that kill to life was announced by the Government.

Under the proposals, which have been put out to consultation by the Government, owners of dogs who seriously injure a person or kill an assistance or guide dog could face up to 10 years behind bars.

The plans were put forward after some 16 people were killed by dogs in the UK since 2005, including 14-year-old Jade Anderson who was savaged by four dogs in March as she visited a friend's house in Greater Manchester.
