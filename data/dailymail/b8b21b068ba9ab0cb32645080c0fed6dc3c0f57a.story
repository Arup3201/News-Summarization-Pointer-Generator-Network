Revealed: Brigitte Höss has been living in anonymity in the U.S. since fleeing Germany after her father's fall

These are the never-before-seen pictures of the Auschwitz commandant's daughter as a young fashion model before she moved to the U.S. where she succeeded in keeping her dark family secret for 40 years.

Brigitte Höss, whose father Rudolf was in charge of the deadliest of the Nazi regime's concentration camps, smiles for the camera during what is thought to have been the early days of her Balenciaga modelling career.

Now aged 80 and dying of cancer, she has revealed the full extent of what is a remarkable story in her first ever interview.

Living in anonymous retirement in Northern Virginia, Höss, who gave an interview to the Washington Post, fears for her life should her identity ever be revealed.

Indeed,
 Brigitte was so shamed by her father's integral role in the Holocaust 
that she was stunned when the Jewish boss of the boutique she worked in 
forgave her when she drunkenly confessed her family tree, understanding 
that she not to blame.

All 
the more stunning is the fact the unnamed fashion store manager - whose 
store served the wives of Congressmen and Senators - had fled Nazi 
Germany in 1938.

Conflicted
 by the memories of her father, who was responsible for the deaths of 
1.1 million Jews and tens of thousands of gypsies and political 
prisoners, Brigitte maintains to this day that her fathers 'was the 
nicest man in the world'.

One of the stipulations of the Post 
interview was that her married name not be used, not any details that 
could potentially lead to her unveiling.

'There
 are crazy people out there. They might burn my house down or shoot 
somebody,”' she said in a thick German accent to interviewer, Thomas 
Harding.

Rudolf
 Höss, was hanged in 1947 after the end of the war and Brigitte, 
together with her mother Hedwig and two brother and two sisters, was 
thrown into abject poverty.

Aged
 80 and recently diagnosed with cancer, she has spent much of the past 
40 years working in a fashion boutique serving prominent Washingtonians,
 including the wives of senators and congressmen.

Arriving in Washington with her Irish
 American husband in 1972, Brigitte's husband busied himself with a 
senior job at a transportation company.

Unable
 to speak excellent English, Brigitte told the Washington Post how she 
found a small part-time job in a fashion boutique where she met her 
future boss, a short Jewish lady.

The two hit it off and she asked Brigitte to come and work for her fashion salon in Washington D.C.

One
 night over drinks, Brigitte confessed her father was Rudolf Höss. Her 
Jewish boss said this did not matter to her, despite having had to flee 
Nazi Germany in the aftermath of the Kristallnacht attacks of 1938.

Throughout
 her life if people asked about her father she would tell them 
matter-of-factly that he died during World War 2, reports The Washington Post.

Brigitte Höss, now 80, is pictured to the far left of this family photo taken she was a young girl and her father was the Kommandant of Auschwitz. The photo is held by her nephew Rainer Hoess, who is the one family member to go public with his distaste for the crimes his grandfather committed

More than 1.1 million Jews, along with 20,000 gypsies and tens of thousands of Polish and Russian political prisoners were killed at Auschwitz

Born Inge-Brigitt Höss on Aug. 18, 1933, her early years were spent moving from one concentration camp to another as her father moved up the ranks of Hitler's SS.

From the age of seven until 11 she lived in a villa beside Auschwitz, where her family resided in fine style.

They were waited upon by staff – many of them prisoners – and their home was decorated with furniture and artwork stolen from prisoners as they were selected for the gas chambers.

They could even see the prisoner blocks and old crematorium from an upstairs window, but Brigitte more fondly recalls visiting the horses and German shepherds at the camp.

In April 1945, with the war clearly lost, the family fled north. They waited for the right moment to escape to South America, but in March 1946 Hanns Alexander, Harding’s great-uncle, caught up with them. After testifying at Nuremberg, Höss was hanged at the gallows next to the Auschwitz crematorium.

Shunned because of their connection to the Nazi regime, Brigitte and her family spent the following years in extreme poverty.

During the 1950s she left Germany to make a new life in Spain where she worked as a model for three years with the up-and-coming Balenciaga fashion house.

In 1961 she married an Irish American engineer working in Madrid. When she confessed to him about her background he was understanding and believed she was ‘as much a victim as anybody else.’

They agreed upon an ‘unspoken and unwritten agreement’ not to talk about her family background.

His work took them to Liberia, Greece, Iran and Vietnam before they moved – together with a young daughter and son – to Washington in 1972.

Initially Brigitte struggled to adapt to her new life, but it helped the she had found a part-time job in a fashion boutique.

Not long after she was hired, she confessed her family background to her boss. Fortunately for Brigitte, the owner told her that she understood that she had not committed any crime herself and she ended up working at the same boutique for the next 35 years.

Brigitte and her husband divorced in 1983 and her daughter is dead, but her son lives with her. She sees her grandchildren often but as yet has not been able to bring herself to discuss her dark secret because she doesn't want to upset them.

She tells The Washington Post that her mother used to visit her in Washington from the 1960s up until the late 1980s when she died while staying with her and as a result she is buried somewhere in Northern Virginia.

Her other siblings live in Germany, although one brother is dead. One family member who has made public that he is related to Höss, is her nephew Rainer, who once told Harding: 'If I knew where my grandfather was buried, I would piss on his grave.'

Brigitte has spent much of her life afraid to talk about her father and even though she knows what he did was terribly wrong, she does remember him fondly.

'He was the nicest man in the world,' 
she says. 'He was very good to us.'

She also tells Harding that her father was 'sad inside.'

She maintains that he was forced to do a lot of things and didn't have a choice.

'He had to do it. His family was 
threatened. We were threatened if he didn’t. And he was one of many in 
the SS. There were others as well who would do it if he didn’t.'

Brigitte doesn't deny the atrocities at Auschwitz and other camps took place, but she questions the numbers that were killed.

'How can there be so many survivors if so many had been killed?' she asks.

When it is pointed out that her father confessed to being responsible for the death of more than a million Jews, she says the British 'took it out of him with torture.'
