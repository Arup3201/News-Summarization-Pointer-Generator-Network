Barcelona beat Manchester City 2-1 at the Etihad to take control of their Champions League last 16 tie and will be confident of finishing the job in the return leg at the Nou Camp on March 18.

Luis Suarez bagged a double in the first half half to send the Catalan giants on their way, before Sergio Aguero struck in the 69th minute to give his side a glimmer of hope. Lionel Messi had a chance to further increases Barca's lead but his last-minute penalty was saved superbly by Joe Hart. 

Here, Sportsmail's Joe Bernstein rates every player's performance at the Etihad...   

Former Liverpool striker Luis Suarez celebrates his opening goal at the Etihad 

MANCHESTER CITY (4-4-2)

Joe Hart 7 – Busier than he'd wanted to have been. No chance with Suarez's goals, dived bravely at the feet of Messi at 2-0 and then kept City in the tie, just, with an injury-time penalty save from Messi.

Pablo Zabaleta 5 – His recent good deserted him. Bamboozled by Neymar early on and struggled to recover and gave away an injury-time penalty for clipping Messi. 

Vincent Kompany 4.5 – Suarez gave him twisted blood as the famous saying goes. Simply couldn't keep up with the Uruguayan

Martin Demichelis 6.5 – Sent off in this fixture a year ago, he made a brilliant block from Messi early but beaten by Suarez for the second goal

Gael Clichy 5 – Looked dazed and confused every time Messi and Alves marauded down his flank, which was regularly. Sent off for two yellows.  

Samir Nasri 6 – The defending part of a winger's game is not his forte – and it cost City. Nearly scored on the stroke of half-time but the damage had been done. 

 City skipper Vincent Kompany had a torrid night trying to contain Suarez and his fellow forwards 

James Milner 6 – Had a brilliant season so Manuel Pellegrini gave him a central role due to Toure's suspension. Alas, our James is no Yaya when it comes to midfield drive and switched back wide after an hour.  

Fernando 5.5 – Signed in the summer for these kind of games. But he couldn't get near the Barca midfield as City were repeatedly cut open in the first half. Booked. 

David Silva 6.5 – Not at his best out wide to accommodate Dzeko but he did come infield to try and get the ball.

Edin Dzeko 5.5 – Had chances to justify his surprise selection, but twice fluffed his lines in front of goal with headers. 

Sergio Aguero 6.5 – Looked forlorn as Suarez took the first half glory but hit back with a fantastic lofted finish past Stegen. 

Substitutes: Fernandinho (for Nasri 62), Bony (for Dzeko 68), Sagna (for Silva 78)  

Manager: Manuel Pellegrini 5 - Stubborn like Arsene Wenger, he persisted with 4-4-2 when it hadn't worked in Europe before. Over-ran in midfield and made the switch to bring on Fernandinho too late.

BARCELONA (4-3-3) 

Marc-Andre ter Stegen 6 – Virtually a spectator until the end of the first-half when he nonchalantly saved from Nasri. Only plays cup games.

Daniel Alves 6.5 – Nobody told the Brazilian that right-backs are meant to stay back in away first legs in Europe. Like an extra forward. Booked.

Gerard Pique 7 – Given Barca's relative lack of physical presence, Pique did well as a main defensive barrier. Took up great position to block Dzeko shot.

Javier Mascherano 6.5 – City tried to target his lack of height by including Dzeko, but the Argentine is as tough as old boots and built play too. 

Jordi Alba 6.5 – Spaniard was rewarded for his adventure from full-back by laying on a second goal for Suarez on a plate.

Sergio Busquets 6 – The unsung hero of the Barca team, keeps the back door closed and perfectly comfortable hitting pinpoint passes to Messi and co.

Ivan Rakitic 6.5 – You've got to be good to keep Xavi out and Ratikic was a metronome, building play and venturing forward to find the incisive pass. Booked. 

Andres Iniesta 6 – Has reinvented himself, a bit like Ryan Giggs. Doesn't tear forward any more but kept the tiki-taka pattern of play going. 

Luis Suarez 9 – Instinctive finish to give Barca the lead after reacting quicker than Kompany to a bouncing ball. Celebrated with guttural roar.

Lionel Messi 8.5 –The Champions League record scorer was dazzling in a supporting role. Set up Suarez for the first and beat three men in the move for Barca's second. Ironically, fluffed his late penalty - and the rebound.

Neymar 6.5 – Showed off the skills he learned in futsal back in Brazil. A magical entertainer who had Zabaleta bamboozled on one occasion. 

Substitutes: Mathieu (for Ratikic 71), Adriano (for Alves 75, booked), Pedro (for Neymar 80) 

Manager: Luis Enrique 7.5 – Rewarded for being bold, not only picking Messi, Suarez and Neymar but also ordering full-backs Alves and Alba forward. 

Man-of-the-match: Luis Suarez (Barcelona)

Referee Felix Brych 7 - There will be a campaign to bring in overseas referees soon judging by the way the German official ran the game. Outstanding positional play and only waved the cards when he had to.
