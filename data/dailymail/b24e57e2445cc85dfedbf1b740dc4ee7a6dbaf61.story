Kickin' Chicken Taco and Cheese Burger Pringles have been spotted on the shelves of the grocery store, Miejer, in Kentucky for $1.50 per tube. They are also available to purchase on Amazon.

And according to online reviews, the latter will be popular with McDonald's fans - with a 'strong pickle' essence and a taste similar to that of a Happy Meal burger.

The Kickin' Chicken Taco-flavored chips, meanwhile, apparently taste very spicy, like 'chili powder'.

In a YouTube review, customer Tami Dunn, who lives in central Kentucky, said of the  Cheese Burger chips: 'This is like a McDonald's burger. Like in a kids' Happy Meal.

'I haven't had that taste in my mouth for years but it comes back to me immediately. It's really good.'

Her husband, Kevin, added: 'The pickle kind of overrides everything, but it tastes like a cheeseburger, a little thin cheeseburger. It's not bad... but it's a bit salty.' 

In relation to the Kickin' Chicken Taco-flavored crisps, the couple agreed that they tasted 'like chilli powder', with Kevin saying: 'It put me off at first because I wasn't expecting it.'
