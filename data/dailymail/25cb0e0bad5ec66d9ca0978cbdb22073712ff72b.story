Gareth Bale, Sergio Ramos and their boss Carlo Ancelotti have been celebrating after winning 16 straight games for the first time in their history.

The trio took to Twitter on Saturday night after they beat Malaga 2-1 to set the record, holding up 16 fingers between them and Ramos saying: 'A seguir trabajando. Buenas noches..!! Let's keep working. Good night..!!.'

The La Liga victory took the club past the 15-match run that had been set by Miguel Munoz in the 1960-61 campaign, and equalled by Jose Mourinho's side in 2011-12.

Real beat Malaga with goals from Karim Benzema and Gareth Bale to move further clear at the top of La Liga ahead of Barcelona’s meeting with Valencia on Sunday.

Their winning run began with a 5-1 thrashing of Basle in the Champions League in mid-September, and has seen them score a quite incredible 59 goals in that time across three separate competitions.

The last time they lost was when they were beaten 2-1 by cross-town rivals Atletico in the Bernabeu on September 13.

And with three home games set to come against Cornella, Celta Vigo and Ludogorets in the Copa del Rey, La Liga and the Champions League respectively, it seems as though that run may continue for a little while yet.
