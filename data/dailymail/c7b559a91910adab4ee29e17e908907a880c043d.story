The newly-appointed female CEO of General Motors is a softly-spoken mother of two teenagers - who is not afraid of taking the company's latest models out for a high-speed spin around the test-track.

Mary Barra, who holds an MBA from Stanford University, is a GM 'lifer' who followed in her father's footsteps and joined the car company aged 18.

The 51-year-old will start her new job on January 15, taking over from CEO Dan Akerson as the first woman to fill the role. The appointment is something of a personal landmark for Mary Barra whose father Ray Makela was a GM die maker for 39 years at the Pontiac plant.

Mary Barra grew up in a car-obsessed 
family in Pontiac, Michigan and studied to become an engineer at the 
GM-sponsored Kettering University in Flint.

In her 33 years at GM Motors, she has risen through the ranks to become the current global product chief.

She
is known for her hands-on approach and is often found at the company's 
test track, whizzing around in the latest models. She also sent GM engineers 
for work experience at local car dealerships so they could see first-hand 
what customers wanted from their vehicles.

Seeing her talent, GM sent Barra to Stanford University where she gained an MBA. She prefers a team approach to problems and is a relentless hard worker - often at her desk by 6am. She is highly competitive about becoming the best in the industry.

The newly-appointed CEO met her husband Tony, a management consultant, while studying at GM's technical school.

In her time at the car industry giant, Barra has seen it buckle under the pressure of a crippled U.S. economy 
and declare itself bankrupt, requiring a government bailout.

However thanks to the guiding hand of Akerson, and Barra's transformative measures in product development, GM Motors has made nearly $20billion.

On Monday, the company officially shed the derisive moniker of 'Government Motors' when the government sold the last of the GM shares it inherited as part of a bailout in 2008 and 2009.

The move by GM to put a woman in the driving
seat means that the 51-year-old mother-of-two has shattered a glass 
ceiling in a typically male-dominated industry.

She 
still faces challenges of paring down GM's costs and winning over buyers
in international markets such as India and South America.

Akerson, 65, said he had planned to stay at least until spring, but his wife's advanced cancer diagnosis changed that.

He
said the board unanimously picked Barra from several internal 
candidates because of the breadth of her experience, her management 
record, her people skills and her understanding of GM's operations.

There was a personal note to his appointment of Barra for Akerson, as he told the New York Times: 'It was almost like watching your daughter graduate from college.'

Akerson 
hinted at Barra's promotion earlier this year when he told a women's 
business group in Detroit that a ‘car gal’ would someday run one of the 
Detroit Three automakers but he made it clear on Tuesday that she wasn't 
picked because she's a woman.

‘Mary's one of the most gifted executives I've met in my career,’ he said.

Following her appointment on Tuesday, Ms Barra tweeted: 'Thanks everyone for your well wishes.'

She added: 'Thanks to Dan Akerson for his amazing leadership. The new @GM team is aligned and ready to continue the momentum and pick up the pace.'

Since
February 2011, Barra has held what many say is the most important job 
at GM.

She joined the company in 1980 as an engineering student and became a plant 
manager, executive director of engineering and head of human resources.

Along
the way, she earned a reputation as a manager who made tough decisions,
yet was able to get people to follow her lead and work as a team, 
according to current and former GM executives.

The
51-year-old executive has been in charge of design, engineering and 
quality for all GM vehicles and has shepherded most of the company's 
recent new vehicle introductions.

Under
her command, GM rolled out brawny new full-size pickup trucks, the 
Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra, and the Chevrolet Impala full-size 
car, which earned the highest score for a sedan in testing by Consumer 
Reports magazine.

During
her tenure, GM's quality scores rose in surveys done by J.D. Power and 
Associates. She also streamlined the organization, eliminating positions
and putting one engineer in charge of each vehicle.

'She
is polished, soft-spoken, invariably polite, but firm and goal-focused.
She will have a learning curve, but will be an excellent CEO,' said Bob
Lutz, a retired GM vice chairman who once led product development.

GM's
previous two CEOs, Akerson and Whitacre, came from outside the auto 
industry and lacked the experience that Barra has, said Erik Gordon, a 
professor at the University of Michigan's Ross School of Business.

'There's
nobody with more years of honest ''car-guy''credentials than she has,' 
Gordon said. 'She's the one to do the breakthrough.'
