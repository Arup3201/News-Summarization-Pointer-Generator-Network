Wearing a fluorescent jacket and chopping wood with an axe, the man in this photograph may look an unlikely star as he carries out his community service.

But this photograph captures the moment when a young drug dealer facing a grim future turned his life around and began his journey to becoming an Olympic champion.

Only nine months after this picture of Anthony Joshua was taken, the 22-year-old won a gold medal in the boxing ring at London 2012.

Learning the hard way: Anthony Joshua chops wood at an allotment in North London in November last year while completing his community service. Nine months later, he was an Olympic champion

Joshua, born in Watford, Hertfordshire, to Nigerian parents, won the Olympic super heavyweight title by beating Italian Roberto Cammarelle in front of 10,000 fans at the ExCeL centre.

It was Team GB's 29th and final gold at the Games.

Joshua was suspended from Britain's boxing squad after he was arrested for possessing cannabis and intent to supply the drug in March last year.

He appeared destined for jail but a judge gave him a second chance and he was sentenced to a 12-month community order and 100 hours’ unpaid work.

Joshua posted the picture of him chopping wood on his Twitter account last November after he worked at the North Finchley Allotment in London, close to the Finchley Amateur Boxing Club where he trains.

Gill Saunders, secretary of the North Finchley Allotment Society, said: 'We remember him very fondly. We knew him as Josh though.

“He was extremely popular and charming. He was a good steady worker and kept his head down, which is unusual on the scheme, because we get a lot of difficult, reluctant people.

'He never picked on anyone or bullied any of the other people on the programme, which can happen.'

Small groups of offenders help out at the site, carrying out maintenance work, clearing paths and gardening.

The scheme has been running for two years and has been credited with transforming the site from a state of neglect to a thriving community allotment.

Ms Saunders said: 'He (Joshua) was very engaging and got on with everyone, you could tell he had something about him, something different.

'He was modest and self-effacing but also had a sort of personal invincibility that all good boxers have, without being cocky.

'One funny thing I remember, was when we got him to sort out the woodpile and he was wielding this massive axe, but he was useless at chopping.

'We teased him that he had all these big muscles but he couldn’t do it.

'He was very good at taking a joke though. We taught him in the end.'

Joshua has admitted that the community service and the shame felt by his family, friends and his boxing colleagues at his conviction helped convince him to change his ways.

‘I could have seen it as a badge of honour,’ he said earlier this year.

‘I could have taken the rap, seen it as a slap on the wrist and done it again. But I didn’t. It wasn’t so much the actual charge that had the effect.

'It was all the grief afterwards, from my friends, from my family – especially my mum – and from boxing.

‘I was just like a lot of young lads. It was all about how I looked, my clothes, clubbing, girls. I wasn’t with the best group of people.

‘The arrest changed a lot. It forced me to grow up and to respect my responsibilities.

‘I’m not happy that I did what I did and there’s no way that kind of thing will ever happen again, but in a way I’m glad it did because it woke me up.

‘I go running on Saturday nights now, not clubbing. I understand that if I’m to fulfil my potential then it’s all about hard work.

'It took me a while to realise this, but since last March I’ve never looked back. And you know what? I’m so much happier as a person, too.’
