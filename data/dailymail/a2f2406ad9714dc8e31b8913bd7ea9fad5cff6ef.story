Mr Justice Holman heard the case in the Court of Protection in London, and ruled that the mentally-ill man should undergo the mastectomy against his will

A mentally-ill man in his sixties diagnosed with breast cancer has undergone surgery against his will after a judge ruled he does not have the capacity to make decisions about his treatment.

Mr Justice Holman heard the case in the Court of Protection in London, where judges consider issues relating to sick and vulnerable people.

Specialists said they thought that the most appropriate treatment for the tumour was a mastectomy but the man had refused to have an operation.

The judge said it was 'quite clear' that the man did not have the mental capacity to make decisions about treatment, and that surgery could be life-saving.

He ruled that it was lawful and in the man's best interests for surgeons to remove the tumour.

He also gave medics permission to 'covertly' sedate and physically restrain the man if necessary.

Mr Justice Holman was told that staff had planned to mix a sedative in the man's breakfast to calm him prior to the trip to hospital.

The judge said while some people might 'recoil' at such an idea, the ends justified the means.

Doctors, court-appointed lawyers who represented the man and the man's nearest relative, his sister, all agreed he should undergo surgery.

The man's sister told the judge at the hearing: 'Something happening against his will is awful but we are talking about his life.'

Mr Justice Holman said the man had to be told about what was going to happen to him prior to being anaesthetised.

The man's sister said he was 'very scared' and would go 'berserk' when he heard the news.

Breast cancer is much rarer in men than women. 

Only about 1 in 1,000 men develop breast cancer in their lifetime.

Around 350 - 400 new cases of breast cancer are diagnosed in men in the UK every year. 

The condition is most often diagnosed in men aged 60-70.

The cancer develops in the small amount of breast tissue men have behind their nipples. 

The most common symptom is a hard, painless lump in one of the breasts. 

Breast cancer in men can also cause nipple problems, such as the nipple turning in on itself (retraction) or nipple discharge. 

In most cases, surgery is used to remove the cancer along with a section of the breast.

This is usually followed by a long-term course of hormone therapy using a medication called tamoxifen.

Tamoxifen helps to block the effects of hormones on breast tissue that are known to stimulate the growth of cancerous cells. It should help prevent the cancer from returning.

In some cases, radiotherapy or chemotherapy may be used for the same purpose. 

The outlook for breast cancer is not as good in men as in women. 

This is because there is reduced awareness of the condition and it may take longer to diagnose.

Mr Justice Holman listened to evidence at a public hearing on December 18, but ruled that nothing could be reported by journalists until surgery had taken place.

He was told that the man, who had learning disabilities and suffered from autism, might learn of the planned operation if there was prior reporting.

And he concluded that a reporting embargo was justified and in the man's best interests.

Lawyers involved in the case say the man underwent surgery earlier this week and is now doing well.

Mr Justice Holman ruled that neither the man nor the NHS trust which had responsibility for his care and had applied for a ruling could be identified.

He said the man, who had never married and had no children, was in a care home in southern England.

'I am quite satisfied on the basis of the written evidence I have heard in this case that it is highly likely that he does have cancer in the area of his breast,' said Mr Justice Holman.

'His sister says he is very scared and will not agree to an operation.' 

The judge added it was 'quite clear' that the man lacked the mental capacity to litigate and make decisions about appropriate treatment.

'The risks of not having surgery far outweigh the risks of having surgery,' said Mr Justice Holman. 'It is overwhelmingly in his best interests to have surgery.'

He said it was likely the man would need to be restrained and gave permission for doctors to sedate the man 'covertly' by giving him a sedative in his breakfast.

'Many people may indeed recoil at the proposal that this gentleman should be given covertly a sedative with his breakfast at the care home in which he lives,' said the judge. 'But in my view this is a situation in which, to put it bluntly, the ends justify the means.

'Minimal force is necessary to enable the man to be taken to hospital for surgery to take place.'

But the judge said patients in the man's position had to be told what was going to happen to them.

The Court of Protection, where the ruling was made, is based at the Royal Courts of Justice, London (pictured)

He said: 'My own view is that even in the case of an incapacitated or very incapacitated patient - leaving aside those who lack consciousness - it remains extremely important in any civilised society that they are not subjected to investigative or invasive surgery that as a minimum being informed in sensitive and appropriate language as to what is about to be done to them before it is done.

'The patient must be told in clear and sensitive terms before he is anaesthetised that he is going to be anaesthetised and that an operation is going to be performed, even at the risk of him going berserk.'
