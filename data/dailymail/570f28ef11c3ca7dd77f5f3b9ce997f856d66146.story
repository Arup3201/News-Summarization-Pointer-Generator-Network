An artist who has been involved in making crop circles for 20 years has unveiled his latest masterpiece - a 'sand circle' measuring a staggering 80 metres across.

Julian Richardson has been involved in the crop circle world since the 1990s, creating a series of mystical pieces around Wiltshire.

But armed with a garden rake, Mr Richardson travelled to Brean Beach near Burnham-on-Sea, Somerset, to create a seaside equivalent.

Mr Richardson, from Pewsey, Wiltshire, spent more than five hours painstakingly working on the huge circle which was filled with perfectly symmetrical stars, triangles and parallelograms.

He said: 'I have been involved in crop circle making since the 1990s - I just love geometry, art and the paranormal.

'But I'm really keen for the work to be legitimised so have begun creating beach art with crop circles as my inspiration.

'The sand here is perfect and, with great aerial views from the top of Brean Down, it's a great location.

'It would be a great venue for a beach art festival in the future featuring artists from across the world.'

Mr Richardson will create a number of circles this summer as he prepares to take part in autumn's Beach Art Championships which will be held in Jersey.

The history of beach art is not fully understood, with different theories suggesting it originated in Australia, California, the Middle East or the south of France.

This year's Beach Art Championships will take place in early autumn. Last year's event saw artists from the UK, France and the USA taking part.

The overall winner was Sam Dougados, from France, who created his work on Ouaisne beach as part of the competition.
