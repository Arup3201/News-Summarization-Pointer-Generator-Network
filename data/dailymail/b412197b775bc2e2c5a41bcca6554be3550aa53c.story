A 10-year-old Celtic superfan (with Down's Syndrome) has been nominated for the SPFL  Goal of the Month for January after being invited to take part in a half-time penalty shootout challenge.

Jay Beatty of Armagh captured the hearts of a nation when he was plucked from the crowd by former Hoops striker Georgios Samaras to join in last year's title winning celebrations.

A video of him enjoying Celtic's lap of honour was shown live on Sky Sports and gathered over two million hits on YouTube after going viral.

Known affectionately as 'Wee Jay', the youngster accompanied Celtic for their 2-0 defeat of Hamilton on January 19 where he met players and was asked to take part in a shootout challenge during the interval - which he duly obliged and scored before celebrating wildly in front of Celtic fans.

Despite losing 2-0, Hamilton had the good grace to include Beatty's strike in their final score, announcing it as 3-0 to Celtic on Twitter.

Samaras, who has since left the club and currently plays for Saudi side Al Hilal  on loan, was so taken with Beatty that he invited him to last year's World Cup in Brazil.

'This boy gives me so much strength, it's incredible,' Samaras said last year. 'There are no words. I feel his love so much. This love I feel, is also felt by many people in Greece.' 

Beatty's goal, which is reportedly leading the votes, will compete for the SPFL Goal of the Month alongside the likes of David Goodwillie, Gary Macakay-Steven, and Mikael Lustig.
