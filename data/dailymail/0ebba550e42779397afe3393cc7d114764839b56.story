A husband has described his pride over how he shot dead his wife, sister-in-law and mother-in-law to restore his honour after accusing her of cheating on him.

Muhammad Ismail murdered spouse Samina Bibi, her sister and her mother in February this year in a jealous rage at their home in an unnamed village in central Pakistan, police say.

Describing the killing spree with chilling clarity, he said he wounded his wife with a shot to her side before leaving her in a pool of blood while he gunned down the two other women in the next room.

Chilling: Muhammad Ismail said he was 'proud' of what he has done, branding his wife a 'prostitute'

He then returned to kill his wife with what bullets he had left in the gun.

'She didn't say anything when I shot her,' he said. 'I didn't want to hear what she had to say anyway.

'I made sure they were all dead. 
Then I locked the door and left the house.'

In the extraordinary confession from behind the bars of his jail cell, he told CNN: 'I am proud of what I did. That's why I turned myself over to the police.'

Ismail accused his wife of eight months of repeatedly flirting with other men and spending long hours away from home.

'My wife never made me 
happy,' said the 20-year-old drummer of a traditional Pakistani
wedding band. 'She was like a prostitute. She never 
took care of me.'

Ismail urged other men whose wives have been unfaithful to follow in his footsteps, adding that he didn't care if he was hanged for the crime because he had restored his honour.

Distraught: The father of Ismail's wife said he has nothing left after losing his wife, and two daughters

The case highlights the growing problem of 'honour' killings in Pakistan - the murder of women wdeemed to have dishonouring their families through infidelity or disobedience.

There, campaigners claim a lax system of justice too often allows murderous husbands to escape justice.

The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan say 943 women were 'killed in the name of honour' in Pakistan last year, an increase of more than 100 from 2010.

But despite his taped confession, Ismail may still escape justice if his wife's family accepts compensation, known as 'blood money'.

However, woman's rights groups say some families are bullied into accepting such payments.

Others say corruption among officials coupled with deep-rooted patriarchal values in some rural parts of the country make it almost impossible to bring many wife-killers to justice.
