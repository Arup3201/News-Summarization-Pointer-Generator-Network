A historic Massachusetts town could be reduced to whisper if a strict new noise ordinance is passed.

Hingham, which lies just south of Boston, is considering rules that would fine residents who made over 55 decibels of noise during the day and more than 45 decibels at night.

Technically you could be fined $100 for your first offense for being louder than a coffee percolator (55 db), a refrigerator (50 db) or even just more than normal conversation (60 db), according to a decibel chart.

Danger: The proposed law could fine residents for making noise above 55 decibels - normal conversation rates at around 60db

'It's really a question of giving police some tools to deal with a quality of life issue,' Hingham Board of Selectmen Chairman Bruce Rabuffo told WBZ.

Hingham town authorities get around 350 complaints a year, with the most in July.

The ordinance, which can seen on the town's website, remains very much a proposal at the moment, but it would also ban construction noise in residential areas between 7pm and 7am.

Power tools would not be permitted between 8pm and 7pm. Noise above the limits would be permitted during the day for no more than 15 minutes in an hour.

Lawn mowers, snow blowers and tractors are all louder than 55 decibels.

Clearing up: Under the rules, snow blowers could only be used for 15 minutes in an hour

Exceptions would be made with certain permits and in emergency situations.

But under the new rules residents would be fined $100 for a first offense, $200 for the second and $300 for the third and any thereafter.

Hingham Selectmen discussed the proposal on Thursday after putting it out for public discussion and they are now working on the document following comments.

Selectman Irma Lauter told the Patriot Ledger: 'I don't think it's ready for prime time yet.'

Some residents of the town were concerned about the possible law change.

Mike Pungitore, who is in the landscaping business, didn't agree with the idea that loud noises could last no longer than 15 minutes in an hour.

Harsh: Under the new rules, town residents would be fined $100 for a first offense, $200 for the second and $300 for the third and any thereafter

'For many houses in this town, it will take longer than 15 minutes to mow a lawn,' he told the paper.

And local man Warren Pelissier of Main Street to the Patriot Ledger: 'It does kind of seem that we are killing a flea with a sledgehammer here.'
