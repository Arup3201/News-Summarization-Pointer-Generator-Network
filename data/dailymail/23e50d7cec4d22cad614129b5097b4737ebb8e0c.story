A gang of armed robbers recruited two teenage girls to clean £38,000 in stolen cash using nail varnish and bleach.

Nakitta Morrison and Holly Davidson, both 19, were called in to help when an exploding dye pack threatened to spoil a loot of stolen bank notes, Liverpool Crown Court heard.

The flatmates became involved with the group known for targeting security guards delivering cash after Miss Davidson 'fell for' their leader, Big Marlon Benjamin.

Police recovered £15,340 in £20 notes from the girls' Liverpool home, along with a power saw that had been used to break into the box containing the stolen money.

A bin bag full of discarded cash was found elsewhere in the building as well as empty bottles of bleach and a dye-stained t-shirt.

The court heard how the girls purchased nail polish remover, bleach and Lucozade from a local convenience store to help the criminals who robbed a G4S driver at a Shell petrol station in Upton.

Members of the violent gang beat the driver with a crowbar after leaping out from behind a hedge, forcing him to surrender the cash.

But, an exploding dye pack that bursts if the box is forced open stained the bank notes, prompting the gang to enlist the girls' help. 

Each was given 16-month prison sentence suspended by Judge David Aubrey QC yesterday after pleading guilty to handling stolen goods, and will be subject to curfews for the next four months.

Asher Bedwell was also jailed by a judge who described the gang's activities as 'a campaign of terror'

Miss Davidson was ordered to take part in a women's turnaround programme for female offenders while Miss Morrison was ordered to take part in a drug rehabilitation scheme.

Gang leader Benjamin was jailed for 13 years and six months at an earlier hearing for theft, robbery, attempted robbery and conspiracy to rob.

Five other men received prison sentences for offences relating to robbery, theft, handling stolen goods and forging registration plates.

The same judge told the men: 'All these victims are probably scarred for life.

'All probably are now looking behind them when they hear footsteps.

'The anxiety and fear you caused to them cannot in my judgement be overestimated.

'It is quite apparent from your attitude and demeanour in the dock you care not.'

'Some of you have embarked on a campaign of terror.

'These offences were well planned and committed as a group.'

Detective Inspector Tom Keaton of Merseyside Police said: 'The group targeted security guards transporting money and ran a highly sophisticated operation, from the point of preparation, right through to the execution of the robbery and the cleaning of the money, everything had been thought of.

'I hope the sentencing of these individuals sends out a strong message that this force is committed to taking people involved in serious and organised crime off our streets and we will use all available resources to tackle them and put them behind bars.'
