Hours after news surfaced that she would be fired next month as co-host of NBC's Today show, Ann Curry wasn't even expected at work.

Reports surfaced late Wednesday  that Curry, who took over the anchor chair June 9, 2011, would be removed from her spot as Matt Lauer's cohost before the network's Olympic coverage begins next month.

But on Thursday morning, rather than calling in sick or skipping work, she was back next to Lauer as though nothing was amiss.

Support: Fans tweeted their support for Curry after she sent out this innocuous message on Thursday morning. Her name became the number one trending topic on Twitter

The New York Times reported that NBC executives were preparing for Curry not to show up on Thursday.

On Wednesday it was reported she would be gone from her role before the Summer Olympics begin July 27. NBC has the rights to air the Olympics and the whole show will be anchored from London.

On Wednesday, Today show producers contacted Hoda Kotb, who co-hosts the fourth hour of the program, and told her to be ready to go on the air at 7am.

But Curry, who reportedly makes $2 million a year, was there, acting like normal.

'Good morning Twitterverse,' she tweeted to her 1.2 million followers on Thursday.

'Good morning. From hot to hotter. You thought yesterday was a scorcher? In many places in the East today, it’s going to get even hotter,' she said at the opening of the show.

Curry has taken 
the blame from many at NBC for the Today show's ratings decline. The 
program lost the top spot among network morning shows this spring, a 
position it had held, unbroken, since 1995.

Part of the problem is a lack of chemistry with Lauer, who had great on-air chemistry with Curry's predecessors Katie Couric and Meredith Vieira.

While NBC won the months of April and May for the morning slot against ABC, multiple weeks they lost to Good Morning America.

One week in April broke the 16 year winning streak, and the week of May 21 Today lost to their rival by 33,000.

Later in Thursday's program she appeared 
alongside Lauer, Al Roker and Natalie Morales -- one of the women who 
has been mentioned as her possible replacement.

Her 'good morning 'tweet, sent out about 8am, received dozens of responses from her fans, who offered her their support.

'To know just how professional @AnnCurry is, she's been faultless co-hosting @todayshow this morning. Despite all the pressure. #ClassAct,' CNN interviewer Piers Morgan tweeted.

The flurry made Ann Curry the top trending phrase on Twitter Thursday morning. Curry didn't respond to any of her supporters.

Curry has been criticized for not being as flexible or quite as quick-witted as Lauer or Couric, who had the hosting job for 15 years before leaving in 2006.

Curry took over as co-anchor from Meredith Vieira one year ago. Vieira has continued to contribute to Today since leaving. She reported from London for the Jubilee earlier this month, pictured, and will also be going to cover the Olympics. She could return as anchor

Couric was replaced by Vieira.

Lauer, who recently received a reported $30 million annual contract to stay at NBC is reportedly one of the people working to push Curry out.

NBC producers are beginning to panic as ABC's Good Morning America has begun trading off with the Today show for the top network morning show.

Curry's more prominent role in the morning show has received the blame for this slump.

Negotiations are currently underway with network executives to move Curry into a new job, likely as a foreign correspondent.

But, she's apparently not leaving without a fight.

'She got her dream job, and she doesn’t want to let it go,' a source told the Times.

Savannah Guthrie, who co-hosts the 
show's third hour, is at the top of the list of Curry's possible 
replacements.

Natalie
Morales, Today's news anchor, and Meredith Vieira, who left the co-host
role last year, have been mentioned in talks for the position, news 
outlets reported.

Vieira has remained involved with NBC. In addition to Today co-hosting duties from London during the Queen's Jubillee, she will also be contributing from the upcoming Summer Olympics for the network.

However, TMZ reported on Thursday she had been offered and refused to return.

Later on Thursday morning's show Curry was on Rockefeller plaza with her cohosts for an interview with Michael Phelps mother

A decision about her departure from the show could be made before the Summer Olympics begins in later this summer.

Several staff members who work on the 
show have blamed Curry as the reason for the decline in ratings after 
she took over the co-host job, according to the New York Times.

Curry could return to her foreign correspondent roots after she leaves the anchor seat

Since then, Today and Good Morning America have been 
trading wins.

Some reports suggest the longtime member of the Today show may become a foreign correspondent at the network.

For Curry, however, the reality of ending her time on the program has been difficult.

Attorney Robert B Barnett is representing Curry in the discussions.

The lawyer is known for having represented Christiane Amanpour in her talks with ABC as she left the news program This Week.

Curry began 
working as news anchor for the Today show in 1997, a position she held 
onto until she was promoted to share the hosting role with Lauer.

She has an extensive background in global reporting.

Curry began a career at NBC in 1990 as part of the NBC News team.
