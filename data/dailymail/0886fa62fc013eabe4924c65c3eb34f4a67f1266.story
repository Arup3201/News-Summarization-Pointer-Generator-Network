The estranged husband of model Monica Olsen accused of offering to pay a hitman $80,000 to have her murdered has been placed in solitary confinement as he awaits trial, it emerged today.

Dino Guglielmelli, 52, is in lock-down at the notoriously violent Men’s Central Jail, in Los Angeles. The millionaire vitamins tycoon is unable to receive visitors or make telephone calls.

A source close to the alleged murder-for-hire plot told MailOnline that Guglielmelli was moved into solitary confinement last week.

Working out through it: Monica Olsen claims she lives in fear after her husband was arrested when he was taped offering a would-be hitman $80,000 to kill her during an acrimonious divorce

Long stretch: Her husband has been moved to solitary confinement. It comes after a court was told that because of his wealth, other inmates have offered to take out the 'rat' hitman who recorded him

'The sheriff deemed he was high-profile and had to go into solitary. He’s in lock down,' the source said.

On the jail’s inmate webpage, a letter N has been placed next to Guglielmelli’s visiting arrangements. The site states that N means inmates are unable to receive visitors 'due to classification, discipline, security'.

Guglielmelli claims he was set up by his friend and would-be hitman Richard Fuhrmann, who recorded the bitter husband apparently asking Fuhrmann to take out his wife.

But sources close to the investigation tell MailOnline that both Monica and Furhmann are terrified he is trying to get at them from behind bars.

According to court documents seen by MailOnline, other inmates have offered to 'visit' Fuhrmann for grassing up Guglielmelli when they get out.

Army vet Fuhrmann, 47, is so frightened he has fled his home in California and has gone into hiding.

Police claim he secretly taped Guglielmelli offering him $80,000 to kill Monica, who created the Skin by Monica Olsen beauty line when she retired from the catwalk.

Guglielmelli and Monica were embroiled in an increasingly bitter custody battle over daughters Cienna, nine, and six-year-old Vandella when he allegedly tried to have her killed.

Prosecutors say he had secretly wired $4.4 million abroad and was planning to flee the country with the children.

Since his arrest seven months ago he has been held at the Men’s Jail, part of LA’s notorious Twin Towers correctional facility.

Notorious: Guglielmelli, 52, is at the Men's Central Jail, part of the infamous Twin Towers correctional facility

Feuding: Guglielmelli is alleged to have turned to the hitman because he feared his wife and mother of his two daughters was winning the divorce battle - and particularly custody of their two daughters

Moving on: Olsen won the family Canyon Country ranch in a pre-divorce hearing. She has now put the six-bedroom mansion on themarket for $3.2million

Luxury: In happier times, Monica and Guglielmelli completely remodeled the property adding a children's wing, play area and guest quarters

Princesses: Monica’s divorce lawyer Ronald Lebow complained in court papers seen by MailOnline, that the children had been cared for 'by a series of 13 nannies' after Monica left

Spa: The six-bedroom, 7000 sq ft house sits on three acres with a 'magnificent' salt water swimming pool

The 9,500-prisoner complex was named as one of the 10 worst jails in the world in 2011 and according to a lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union violence by guards on inmates is widespread.

Officers, who monitored 500 phone calls and numerous jail visits before Guglielmelli was put into solitary, say he offered to pay hardened prisoners 'protection' money, according to court documents.

'He is not a criminally sophisticated individual when it comes to street crimes,' Detective Mike Staley said at one of Guglielmelli’s court hearings. 'He has had some incidents in jail. He used the wrong toilet one time and was made to do a bunch of push-ups by African-American inmates.

'Right after that, he was approached by (what) we call shot callers, he called it the dorm manager. He offered to put money in the dorm manager’s books for protection.

'People like Mr Guglielmelli in custody are very quickly sized up as being rich. Whether he is or not, he has the appearance of being very wealthy. And with that comes power within the jail system.

'Often times we have had many, many incidents where people will leave, get released and go visit people on the outside for witness intimidation, assaults and murder.'

The 
detective said a taped visiting-room conversation between Guglielmelli 
and his long-time employee Tracee Sidell revealed that 'sympathetic' 
inmates had offered to visit 'rat' Furhmann.

Guglielmelli,
 whose Creation’s Garden beauty supplements business had revenues of $48
 million a year, allegedly turned down one offer, then wrote a name down
 on a piece of paper.

Staley
 admitted Guglielmelli could have been writing the prisoner’s name down 
to report him but no piece of paper had been handed in to guards. He 
told the court he believed he had written down Fuhrmann’s details.

Furhmann is expected to be the star witness at Guglielmelli’s trial next month.

His friendship with Guglielmelli turned sour after Monica slapped him with a subpoena to give evidence during a custody hearing.

Furhmann
 said he didn’t mention Guglielmelli’s threats then but after 
Guglielmelli exploded in temper over his perceived disloyalty he feared 
the former waste disposal entrepreneur would find another hitman, according to court papers.

Model mom: Monica gave up her catwalk career to have children and has since launched her own brand of skin care products. Her business with Dino was thriving until their relationship fell apart

Hit: Fuhrmann alleged in court papers that 'What I heard extensively, most 
continuously (from Dino), was when is this going to happen? Do we have a time frame?
 Is this going to be over soon?'

'We went into his office. He slammed the door and just kind of went on a tangent for a good five minutes,' Furhmann told investigators, according to court papers seen by MailOnline.

'He shouted: "That stupid bitch is going to get away with it (referring to winning the custody battle)."

'What I heard extensively, most continuously, was when is this going to happen? Do we have a time frame? Is this going to be over soon?'

Fuhrmann said there were 'a number of conversations where he needed to know when this was going to be over, give me a date, give me a time. If no, I’ve got to take care of it.

'I was absolutely panicked that he would accelerate or move things along without me being in control of it anymore and he really would take things into his own hands. 

'He absolutely had the means to do that. Dino is a smart man. He’s got money.'

By
 then Monica, who appeared in the Rachel McAdams movie The Hot Chick, 
was demanding full custody of the children and half of his business 
empire.

Guglielmelli, 52, has pleaded not guilty to attempted murder and solicitation to murder.

His defense attorney Anthony Brooklier said: 'I think when you hear the tapes, when the jury hears the tapes,' Brooklier said, 'you'll understand he was manipulated by somebody who was trying to help himself.'

Monica’s
 spokesman Sean Borg said: 'Monica is still very frightened and jumpy. 
Her husband was very controlling throughout their 10-year marriage and 
she fears he will continue to try to get at her from behind bars.'

Monica is so traumatized she has put the ranch she shared with Gugliemelli up for sale.

Friends
 say she cannot stand being inside the sprawling Canyon Country mansion 
and is jumpy is she hears even the slightest noise.

Last
 month - in a pre-divorce hearing - a matrimonial judge ordered that she
 get the house, plus a couple of commercial buildings.

Fear: Monica's spokesman, Sean Borg, said she's 'still very frightened and jumpy. 
Her husband was very controlling throughout their 10-year marriage and 
she fears he will continue to try to get at her'

The six-bedroom, 7000 sq ft house sits on three acres. There is a 'magnificent' salt water swimming pool and spa.

In happier times, Monica and Guglielmelli completely remodeled the property adding a children's wing, play area and guest quarters.

The property, which also includes a swimming pool and spa is now on the market for $3.2million. When the couple, who married in 2004, first split Guglielmelli stayed in the house. 

Monica’s divorce lawyer Ronald Lebow complained in court papers seen by MailOnline, that the children had been cared for 'by a series of 13 nannies' after Monica left.

He also claimed that Gugliemelli’s girlfriend, business staff and household aides had periodically lived in the house. 

After his arrest, Guglielmelli handed over power of attorney to his older brother Gino who filed for bankruptcy on hisbehalf.

He listed debts of just $1.5 million - despite business assets that included $8 million in beauty stock, a warehouse, factory equipment and company vehicles.

Creation’s Garden, which once employed 250 staff, was sold off at auction.

Monica is now trying to re-launch her arm of the business, which included 52 beauty creams and baby skin care products.
