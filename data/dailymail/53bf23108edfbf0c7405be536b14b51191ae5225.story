Younes Kaboul believes Tottenham are finally clicking defensively under new manager Mauricio Pochettino.

Spurs have got off to an indifferent start since Pochettino moved to the club from Southampton in the summer.

But a draw away against rivals Arsenal and a win against the Argentine's former club on Sunday – both strong defensive displays – have left them sitting sixth in the table going into the international break.

And Kaboul has put their return to form down to their strong defending. The Tottenham captain said: 'I feel that and we feel that against Arsenal we showed that we were solid.

'We showed that we were well-organised and we just have to carry on like that and concentrate in every game for 90, 95 minutes.

'It is very important for us at the back, especially.'

Pochettino has set his side the target of finishing in the top four and winning the Europa League in his first season.

Their 11 points in the opening seven games puts them level with Manchester United in that fourth spot.

A real test of their Champions League credentials will come straight after the break when they are up against champions Manchester City.

Kaboul added: 'We need to be mentally prepared and physically. We need to produce a similar performance to the one against Arsenal.

'I know each game is different, but we need to learn from the Arsenal game because it is a big team, were are going to play a massive team again.

'We won against Southampton and it is very important because before the kick-off we were 12th, now we are sixth. We are very happy.'
