'Nobody knows the story to her. She won't talk to nobody. It's like a mysterious story on the internet,' Mossy Grove's Alexandria Schubert, who spotted the woman in east Tennessee, told WATE.

Police have identified the woman as Elizabeth Poles, 56, of Motts, Alabama. Beyond that, details are sparse.

WATE reported Poles told Sullivan County Sheriff's investigators she was from an Islamic nation and worked at the Pentagon, but they determined that wasn't true.

The Inquisitr reported that some people think she is on a 'Bible mission' and is heading to Virginia, referencing a YouTube clip in which she is seen arguing with a man about religion in a parking lot. Others think she is mentally ill.
