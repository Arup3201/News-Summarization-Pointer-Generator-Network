Gordon Ramsay is being investigated for ‘serious fraud’ after a whistleblower leaked a damning internal document to the taxman. 

The explosive memo alleges that a massive unpaid tax bill – understood to be a seven-figure sum – was covered up during a previous investigation in 2010. 

It was written by Trevor James, former finance director of the TV chef’s restaurant empire, who  began working for him having previously investigated Ramsay on behalf of HM Revenue &  Customs.

Mr James was sacked by Ramsay in mysterious circumstances earlier this year.

Ramsay’s business was first probed by the taxman in 2005, when HMRC looked at claims that management had been abusing cash from the company’s tips fund.

Ramsay was later cleared of wrongdoing by inspectors, after agreeing to pay back some outstanding tax.

Now HMRC has launched a second major investigation into Gordon Ramsay Holdings, after suggestions that Mr James – who was recruited by Ramsay in 2007 – misled officials during the previous probe.

Ramsay, 46, denies any wrongdoing and has employed consultants Deloitte to act for him and his  company at ‘enormous expense’, with five senior partners trawling through 30,000 emails in an attempt  to clear the chef’s name. 

The investigation is a civil matter, but Revenue officials have the power to bring criminal charges if individuals are found to have committed serious tax evasion, and the penalties can include jail.

The leaked letter, dated 2010, is understood to have detailed how the restaurant empire had slashed its tax and National Insurance bill by hiding the facts from HMRC’s inspectors.

The memo is believed to have boasted of Mr James’s success in reducing the company’s tax liabilities, saying the whole truth had not been told to HMRC – and also alleging that money from the staff tips fund was used inappropriately.

Company reports show that Mr James officially resigned as a Gordon Ramsay director in May, with sources close to the chef claiming his position had become ‘untenable’.

Mr James signed a watertight gagging clause to prevent him speaking out about the case.

Ramsay’s spokesman last night insisted he had personally disclosed the document to tax officials as soon as he was made aware of it, and claimed HMRC is ‘satisfied Gordon was unaware of its contents’. 

However, sources connected with the business have told this news-paper that the chef was ‘well aware’ of the contents of the memo, and ‘refused advice’ from senior staff to approach the authorities.

Mr James, the company’s compliance director, was hired by Gordon Ramsay Holdings from his previous role as a tax inspector.

He had even been involved in the previous investigation into Ramsay’s accounting practices, and was referred to in the chef’s autobiography as ‘Mr Delve’.

He later helped strike a deal with authorities which saw the business settle its affairs in 2010.

He was made a director of the business when the company’s previous finance chief, Ramsay’s father-in-law Chris Hutcheson, left amid a bitter row with the chef over cash.

Documents filed with Companies House 
show Mr James’s final positions among Ramsay’s businesses were 
officially terminated on May 7 this year, but one accounts document says
 he ceased to act as a director on September 17, 2012.

A source involved with the chef’s restaurant management yesterday 
claimed the investigation had yet to be concluded, but said a new 
strand of the probe had been opened recently after authorities accepted 
Ramsay’s innocence.

When The Mail on Sunday approached the chef about the document yesterday, while he was filming his US television show in Colorado, he said: ‘It wasn’t even to me. It wasn’t a document, it was a letter. Yeah, it wasn’t even an email. You will have to excuse me.’

The document also claims that Ramsay may have misused tips intended to be split between restaurant staff, suggesting £375,000 had not been declared to the taxman.

Asked about the allegations, the chef said: ‘Complete and utter rubbish.’

The company yesterday accepted that some funds from the company’s tips account – known as a ‘Tronc fund’ – had been distributed ‘incorrectly’ but insisted that none had gone to the chef personally. 

A spokesman said the tips issue related to the payment of National Insurance contributions and using the tips as part of an employee’s  salary for taxation purposes, and added that Ramsay believed the Tronc issues had been resolved.

It comes amid major financial concerns for the firm, which has debt liabilities of £36.6 million and cash assets of just £45,500.
