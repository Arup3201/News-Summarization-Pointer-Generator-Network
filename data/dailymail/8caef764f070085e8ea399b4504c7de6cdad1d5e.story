Google has threatened to ban French newspapers from its search engine if the country passes a law to make search engines pay for the right to use news articles online.

The new law, dubbed the 'Google law,' has been spearheaded by French newspapers, and mirrors a similar law under consideration in Germany.

The owners of many French newspapers are in favor of the tax, believing their revenue and copyrights are compromised when Google's search results display their content.

Google has threatened to remove French newspapers from its search engine if a new tax which would force them to pay to use content comes into force.

Google News is a the search giant's computer-generated news site.

It aggregates headlines from news sources worldwide, groups similar stories together and displays them according to each reader's personalized interests.

Google says stories on the system are 'selected and ranked by computers that evaluate, among other things, how often and on what sites a story appears online.'

France's minister for high technology, Fleur Pellerin told France's Le Figaro newspaper that the government is studying the idea and that 'Europe will be stronger if it can move ahead unified on that idea.'

She was in Berlin last week to speak with her counterpart about the proposals, a spokesman said.

French Culture Minister Aurelie Filippetti also recently told a parliamentary commission it is 'a tool that it seems important to me to develop.'

However, Google says that such a law 
would 'threaten its very existence,' according to a letter it sent to 
several French officials and published online today.

'There
has been some interest around an extract from a note we have prepared 
about a proposal by French news publishers associations to require 
search engines to license all of the content that they help users to 
find across the web,' said Olivier Esper, Google's Director of Public 
Policy in France.

'The web has led to an explosion of content creation, by both professional and citizen journalists.

'So it's not a secret that we think a law like the one proposed in France and Germany would be very damaging to the internet.

'We have said so publicly for three years.'

Google
said the move was 'detrimental to French users, innovation on the 
Internet and ultimately to the news publishers themselves.'

However,
the search giant said: 'We have always been and remain committed to 
collaborate with French Publishers associations as they experiment and 
develop sustainable economic models on the Internet.'

Google's representatives met in Paris
with Fleur Pellerin, the French Minister for small business, innovation
and numeric economy, according to Arnaud Guillois, a spokesman for the 
French embassy in Washington.

Google is also part of a lobbying group in Germany that opposes the proposed law there, as well, though the company hasn't sent a similar position paper to the German government, a Google spokesman said.

Brazilian newspapers have boycotted Google News over the search engine's refusal to pay for content

The latest row comes as newspapers accounting for 90 per cent of the circulation in Brazil have abandoned Google News.

Brazil's
National Association of Newspapers says all 154 members had followed 
its recommendation to ban the search engine aggregator from using their 
content.

The papers say Google News refused to pay for content and was driving traffic away from their websites.

Google had previously said that the service boosted traffic to news websites.

'Staying
with Google News was not helping us grow our digital audiences,' said 
the association's president, Carlos Fernando Lindenberg Neto.

'By
providing the first few lines of our stories to Internet users, the 
service reduces the chances that they will look at the entire story in 
our websites,' he said in an interview with the Knight Centre for 
Journalism.

The
National Association of Newspapers, known by its Portuguese acronym 
ANJ, carried out an experiment with Google that began in December 2010.

This
allowed Google News to carry the top line of news stories to raise 
curiosity and get readers to click on the full story on the newspapers' 
sites.

However, ANJ says that the experiment has failed.

Among
the 154 titles that have pulled out from Google News are some of the 
country's most important news sites such as O Globo and O Estado de Sao 
Paulo.

At
a recent meeting of the American Press Association in Sao Paulo, Google
defended its decision not to pay for the headlines from news websites.

'Google News channels a billion clicks to news sites around the world,' said Google's Public Policy director Marcel Leonardi.

Brazil's
newspaper association said that despite leaving Google News, many of 
the news organisations' internet portals will still be listed by the 
aggregator.

Internet users using Google — but not Google News — will still be able to find content from most newspapers' sites, said ANJ.
