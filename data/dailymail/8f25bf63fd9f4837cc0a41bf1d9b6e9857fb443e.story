Archaeologists from Israel say they have have stumbled onto a Neolithic murder mystery after two bodies were found dumped in a well dating back 8,500 years.

Researchers from the Israel Antiquities Authority unearthed the ancient well in the Jezreel Valley, south-west of Nazareth, after it was discovered by road maintenance workers.

But they have no idea how the skeletal remains of a 19-year-old girl and an older man came to be dumped deep down the 26ft well, and suggest that it may be a case of murder.

'What is clear is that after these unknown individuals fell into the well it was no longer used,' said Yotam Tepper, the archaeologist in charge of the dig.

The ancient well was found by workers from the Israeli National Roads Company as they carried out preliminary work to enlarge a junction on the area's Highway 66.

Researchers believe the well was sunk by ancient farmers who used its waters for livestock and crops raised on the fertile surrounding plain.

'The impressive well that was revealed was connected to an ancient farming settlement and it seems the inhabitants used it for their subsistence and living,' Dr Tepper said.

'The upper part of the well was built of stones and its lower part was hewn in the bedrock. Two capstones, which narrowed the opening, were set in place at the top of the well.'

He added that the well had been measured at about 26ft deep and 4ft wide.

Relics: Aside from the skeletal remains, researchers discovered these deeply denticulated sickle blades knapped from flint which were used for harvesting, as well as arrow heads and stone implements

The mysterious remains were not the only evidence of the well's original users that the IAA team discovered.

'Numerous artefacts indicating the identity of the people who quarried it – the first farmers of the Jezreel Valley – were recovered from inside the well,' said Dr Tepper.

'The finds include, among other things, deeply denticulated sickle blades knapped from flint which were used for harvesting, as well as arrow heads and stone implements.

'The excavation of the accumulations in the well shaft yielded animal bones, organic finds and charcoal which will enable future studies about the domestication of plants and animals, and also allow researchers to determine the exact age of the well by means of advanced methods of absolute dating'

He added: 'The well reflects the impressive quarrying ability of the site’s ancient inhabitants and the extensive knowledge they possessed regarding the local hydrology and geology which enabled them to quarry the limestone bedrock down to the level of the water table.

'No doubt the quarrying of the well was a community effort that lasted a long time.'

Lucky find: The well was unearthed by workers from the Israel's National Roads Roads company as they carried out preliminary work to expand a junction. It will new be conserved for exhibition to the public

According to Dr. Omri Barzilai, head of the Prehistory Branch of the Israel Antiquities Authority, such finds are rare in Israel - and indeed in the prehistoric world in general.

'The two oldest wells in the world were previously exposed in Cyprus and they indicated the beginning of the domestication phenomenon,' he said.

'It seems that ancient man tried to devise ways of protecting his drinking water from potential contamination by the animals he raised, and therefore he enclosed the water in places that were not accessible to them.

'The wells had another important advantage: quarrying them provided access to an available source of water that was not dependent upon springs or streams.

'Another well, which is about 1,000 years later than those in Cyprus, was previously exposed at the Atlit Yam site in Israel, and another well from this period has now been exposed at the ‘Enot Nisanit’ site.

'The exposure of these wells makes an important contribution to the study of man’s culture and economy in a period when pottery vessels and metallic objects had still not yet been invented”.

The Israel Antiquities Authority and National Roads Company will act to conserve the well and exhibit it as part of the sites around Tel Megiddo in the different periods.
