An Iowa woman had an eye-opening experience last week when she went to the doctor for a stomach ache and gave birth to rare twins in the hospital hours later.

Shelby Magnani and her fiancé James Croskey of Ankeny, Iowa had no idea Shelby was six-months-pregnant with one child - let alone two.

Ava and Anna were born by C-section last Thursday weighing just four and three pounds each.

Not only was Shelby pregnant with twins, but she was pregnant with a rare form called monoamniotic twins who only have a 50 per cent survival rate because they share the same placenta and sac which can lead to complications, reports Whotv.

Miracle twins: Ava and Anna were born by C-section on Thursday after their mother Shelby Magnani went to the doctor for a stomach-ache and later discovered she was six-months-pregnant with rare monoamniotic twins

All bundled up: The premature twins will have to spend a few weeks in medical care but will be home and healthy with mom and dad in a couple of weeks 

Optimistic: The monoamniotic twins weigh just four and three pounds each and even though their type of twin has just a 50 per cent survival rate, they are doing great and are expected to go home soon

Happy parents: James Croskey and his fiance Shelby Magnani feel blessed to have given birth to such beautiful and healthy daughters despite not knowing Shelby was pregnant with twins

'I had really sharp pain in my left side and went into the doctor, and they said we think you might be pregnant. They told me I was six months and told me to get down to the ER. They did an ultrasound and told me it was twins,' says Shelby Magnani of the whirlwind experience. 

'It`s pretty nuts, still sinking in,' said her fiancé James Croskey who was both shocked and elated to hear the news. 

Dr. Jennifer Krupp with Perinatal Center of Iowa explained how when twins share both a placenta and a sac, as in the case of Ava and Anna, their cords can become entangled which can cause serious health problems and death.

'About one to two percent of all pregnancies are twins but even rarer than that is monoamniotic twins. They have one placenta and one amniotic sac and both of those twins share the placenta as well as the sac,' says Dr.  Krupp.

Less than one per cent of all twins are monoamniotic, she added.

'The entanglement of the cords is what we worry about. We bring the patients into the hospital at 24 to 26 weeks, so we can monitor the babies several times a day, because we know the risk of one or both of those babies dying is fairly significant,' says Dr. Krupp.

Celebrating: Shelby and James are overjoyed and celebrating the birth of their twin girls Ava and Ana 

Lucky girls: The twins are being monitored but are doing well and should be going home with their happy mother and father in just a couple of weeks 

Monoamniotic: Both Ava and Anna survived birth despite being monoamniotic twins meaning they shared both a sac and placenta when they were in their mother's womb

Delighted: Shelby Magnani is thrilled to be a mother even though the birth of her twins was truly unexpected 

That's no tummy-ache: Shelby Magnani went to the doctor and soon enough will leave the hospital with her monoamniotic twin girls Ava and Anna  

Proud parents: Shelby Magnani had never been so happy to have a stomach ache as she was on Thursday when she miraculously gave birth to rare twins without ever knowing she was pregnant 

Magnani said that she realizes just how lucky she is that her children are alive and doing well.

The twins will spend the next several weeks in the NICU at Mercy Hospital Medical Center in Des Moines but other than some monitoring are expected to be okay.

'I`m still trying to process. It`s crazy how high risk mono-mono twins can be, and how good they`re doing now, it`s really a blessing,' says Magnani.

'They`re both just little miracles, it could have been so many things that went wrong that didn’t,' she effused.

Doctors expect that Ava and Anna will be able to go home with their doting parents in just a couple of weeks.

Both Croskey and Magnani are still in school at DMACC for automotive technology, reports Fox.

They told reporters that when they graduate they want to open their own business.
