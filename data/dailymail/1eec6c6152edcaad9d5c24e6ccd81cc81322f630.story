Police say the driver of the light-coloured SUV station wagon ran a red light causing them to hit the two teenagers and propel them several metres, Nine News reports.

Detectives are now analysing debris from the vehicle and looking over CCTV footage of the accident captured on a nearby resident's security camera.  

Jasmine, who  was due to start Year 12 on Thursday at Copperfield College, a serious head injury, broken arm, broken hip and extensive grazing

Jasmine's mum Suong Phung said she is praying her daughter will survive.

'I trust in my God. He's done a lot of miracles in my life,' she told the Herald Sun.

'I keep praying — that's all I do.'

Jasmine, who is a student at Copperfield College, was due to start Year 12 on Thursday. 

Her friend Anthony had recently accepted a motor mechanics apprenticeship after finishing up at Keilor Downs Secondary College last year. 

He suffered critical head injuries in the accident and was placed on life support until he died on Wednesday night. 

The parents of both teenagers are pleading for witnesses to come forward to track down the driver.

CCTV footage from the area shows a damaged car leaving  following the accident.

'We've recovered debris at the scene which we believe will help up to identify the make and model of the vehicle,' Detective Inspector Bernie Rankin said.

Major Collision Investigation Unit detectives are investigating and are keen to speak to any witnesses and appeal for the driver to come forward. 

Anyone who witnessed the incident or who may have further information is urged to contact Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000.
