A Maryland jury has convicted a 
District of Columbia police officer of killing his mistress and leaving 
their baby daughter to die in a hot car.

The Prince George's County jury 
returned the verdict Thursday evening against Richmond Phillips on two 
counts of first-degree murder.

Phillips was arrested in June 2011 
after police found the body of 20-year-old Wynetta Wright in the Oxon 
Run Stream Valley Park. Prosecutors claimed that Phillips shot Wright with a handgun, then dragged her body into a wooded area.

Guilty: Richmond Phillips, a Washington D.C., police officer involved in a paternity dispute with his mistress has been found guilty on two counts of first-degree murder. Phillips shot the woman dead and left their infant child to die in a hot car

Richmond Phillips killed 20-year-old Wynetta Wright and their 1-year-old child, Jaylin, because he didn't want to pay child support, prosecuting attorney Angela Alsobrooks said

Wright's 1-year-old daughter, Jaylin, was 
found dead in a car nearby. Police say the girl may 
have died as a result of exposure to the heat. The car doors were closed and the windows rolled up.

During the closing arguments of 
Thursday's trial, prosecutors said that Phillips parked the car and then
left the baby to 'bake and cook until she was dead', reported ABC7 News.

Court records show Phillips and Wright were involved in a paternity dispute.

During opening statements on 
Monday prosecuting attorney Angela
Alsobrooks said Phillips killed the two 
because he didn't want to pay child support.

Phillips is being tried on two counts of first-degree murder along with child abuse and firearms charges. 

Prosecutors say Phillips faces life without the possibility of parole plus 20 years at sentencing March 22.

Funeral services were held in June 
for the two victims. The mother and daughter were described as lying 
together in one casket after their tragic deaths.

‘It's indescribable, it hurts my heart to know that she went through that,’ Andrea Smith, the victim’s cousin, told ABC7 News at the time.

Friends and family have described the late 20-year-old mother as sweet, outgoing and determined.She was a member of the Prince George’s County Sheriff’s Explorer program and one day had a dream of becoming a sheriff’s deputy.

Police say they believe Phillips lured Wright to the woods behind a Hillcrest Heights community center Monday night and killed her.

He then left the baby to die strapped in her car seat in 100-degree heat, police say. Wynetta was found lying in Oxon Run Stream Valley Park, Maryland, and was pronounced dead at the scene.

Shortly thereafter, Jaylin was found abandoned and dead in the nearby vehicle.

Phillip’s defense lawyer, Brian Denton, told jurors his client is innocent and that the evidence is circumstantial.

The suspect’s mother, Ruth Phillips told ABC 7 in June 2011 that she doesn’t believe her son commited the two murders. ‘I didn’t raise him like that,’ she said.
