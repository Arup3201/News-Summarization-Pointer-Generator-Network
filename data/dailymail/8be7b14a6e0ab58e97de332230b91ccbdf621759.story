Manchester United have given a trial to a West Ham youngster who has been branded the 'next Gareth Bale.

Oscar Borg, 16, is currently trying to impress at Old Trafford but has also attracted interest from Southampton, according to the Daily Express.

Nicknamed 'Gareth' by the West Ham coaching set-up for a similar style of play to the Welsh wizard, Borg looks to have a bright future.

Talent: The 16-year-old wing back Oscar Borg is on trial at Manchester United

Compliment: Borg has been compared to Real Madrid star Gareth Bale

Should Borg impress, he will cost United around £220,000 but as he is not signed on as a scholar at West Ham he is free to move.  

The east Londoners have also offered another rising star, Reece Oxford, a new and much improved deal to stay following interest from United, Arsenal and Chelsea.

Oxford is a 15-year-old defender who has already played for West Ham's Under 18 side.

The deal is believed to be the biggest the club have ever offered to a player under 20.

Speaking earlier this month Hammers co-owner David Sullivan spoke of the club's intention to keep Oxford and blasted England's top sides for continually poaching the lesser clubs' best talent.

'It almost makes you give up on having an academy if they can come in and nick your best 15-year-old. What's the point?,' Sullivan said.

In the hunt: Louis van Gaal's Manchester United are one of several clubs interested in Borg

Development: Bale's former club Southampton are also interested in Borg

Rising star: Oxford in action for the West Ham development squad against Shakhtar Donetsk on Saturday
