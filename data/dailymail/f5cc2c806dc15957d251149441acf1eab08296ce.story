Gareth Bale paid back all of his world-record transfer fee with one lung-busting, Spanish Cup-winning wonder goal.

It was his 20th for Real Madrid, his first against Barcelona. The match had been dubbed the game of his life and he produced the goal of his career to settle it.

There were shades of ‘Taxi for Maicon’ when he picked the ball up on the halfway line and steamed down the left. Bartra barged him off the field but he still went past the young defender, cut into the area and shot past Jose Pinto.

The Madrid bench erupted with 
substitutes and technical staff on the pitch and the white half of 
Valencia’s Mestalla stadium got to their feet with the game all but won.

There was still time 
for Neymar’s shot to hit a post at the other end and roll back into Iker
 Casillas’s arms but it was Madrid and Bale’s night. He had won the 
battle of last summer’s big signings and his first trophy in Spain.

At
 the final whistle injured  Cristiano Ronaldo and Real’s  sporting 
director Zinedine Zidane ran on to the pitch to embrace the Welshman. It
 was a goal of which they would both have been proud.

Real Madrid director and former Spanish Cup winner Emilio Butragueno said: ‘He ran 50 metres with a power that was frightening.’

The trophy could be the first of three for Bale this season with Real Madrid in the hunt for the Champions League and La Liga.

Bale started strongly, as did Madrid. He was released by Isco and sent an angled shot just wide.

Iniesta
 carried the greatest threat for Barcelona going down under Daniel 
Carvajal’s challenge. The  22-year-old right back had got a foot to the 
ball and referee Antonio Lahoz ignored penalty appeals.

Bale
 forced a corner off Javier Mascherano when fed by Karim Benzema as 
Madrid pressed. His ability to take full advantage of the space left by 
Dani Alves was an early tactic and on 10 minutes it paid off.

Isco
 robbed the Brazilian high up the pitch and released Benzema. He fed 
Bale and the Welshman’s cross was controlled by Angel Di Maria. The 
Argentine looked level with the last defender, the flag stayed down, and
 although Pinto got a hand to his shot he failed to keep it out. Carlo 
Ancelotti’s team had hit their rivals where they were most vulnerable.

Having
 taken the lead, Real retreated and Barca took the initiative. Bale did 
go on another run across the face of the goal but this time pulled the 
ball back to Di Maria and the move was snuffed out.

For
 Barcelona, Iniesta threaded a pass through to Cesc Fabregas but the 
former Arsenal player overhit his pass and nobody reached it.

Iniesta’s
 magic apart, Barcelona were hitting too many long balls and Leo Messi 
was struggling to get involved. Barcelona dominated possession but their
 passes went in straight lines, not the defence-unlocking diagonals of 
old.

Worst of all for 
Barcelona, Neymar showboated down the right when most fans feel he 
should play left. The pattern of the second half  followed the first, 
with Barcelona camping in greater numbers in Madrid’s area. But with 
Isco always ready to steal possession and Bale, Benzema and Di Maria 
quicker out of the blocks on the break, a second goal from Madrid looked
 likely.

Bale saw his 
headed goal at the back post ruled out for a foul on the keeper. The 
decision looked harsh and from Barca’s next attack they won a corner 
which Xavi planted on Bartra’s head. He powered it between Casillas and 
his left-hand post — the most un-Barca of goals.

But Bale’s searing run delivered the eye-popping winner.
