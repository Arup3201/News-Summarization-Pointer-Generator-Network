A 15-year-old boy was shot in the back by a Los Angeles police officer who spotted him in an alley standing next to someone holding what turned out to be a replica gun, authorities have said.

Jamar Nicholson was taken to a hospital and released to his mother after treatment the same day.

An LAPD captain has apologized to his mother, but the teenager said he wanted to hear the same from the officer.

Jamar Nicholson, 15, pictured with his mother Geraldine, shows the bullet wound on his back where he was mistakenly shot by an LAPD officer after standing next to someone who was holding a replica gun 

‘I don't want to see him again,’ Jamar told the Los Angeles Times. ‘But I do want that ‘sorry’.’

Sgt. Frank Preciado said: ‘What the officer thought was a weapon turned out to be a replica handgun.’

The LAPD is investigating Tuesday’s incident that involved two officers from a gang homicide unit.

Police say the two officers were driving in the 7200 block of 10th avenue on Tuesday morning when they spotted a teenager pointing what they thought was a gun at another person Tuesday morning.

Officers ordered the boy to drop the weapon, Preciado said. When he didn't comply, one of the officers opened fire.

The teenager holding the replica weapon wasn't hurt, but Jamar, who standing next to him, was struck in the upper back.

Everyone present was detained but no arrests were made, the LA Times reported. The officers concluded that they all were friends.

The replica gun, which resembles a real firearm except for the orange tip, involved in the shooting was put on display by police yesterday to highlight the dangers of such toys

But Jamar disputed the officer's account.

He said ‘I promise I never heard anything’ like a command to drop the gun and added the officer fired just after shouting ‘Freeze!’

He showed the Times a bandage on his upper back where the bullet hit him.

Police put the replica gun on display on Thursday as they pointed out the dangers of such toys. It resembles a real pistol except for a tiny orange piece on the tip.

The replica firearm was booked as evidence and a department spokesman told the LA Times that the person holding the fake gun could potentially face charges of brandishing a replica weapon in the presence of a police officer.

This is still being discussed with prosecutors.

At least one of the officers involved has been removed from the field pending review and placed on desk duty, Yahoo News reports.

The officer has also been ordered to undergo a psychological assessment, as is standard in officer-involved shootings.

The incident is being investigated by the Force Investigation Division. It is also being reviewed by the police chief, the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office, and the Police Commission.

LAPD Commander Andrew Smith said: ‘It's certainly an unfortunate situation.

‘But because of people bringing replica weapons out like that, it certainly could have been a terrible tragedy.’
