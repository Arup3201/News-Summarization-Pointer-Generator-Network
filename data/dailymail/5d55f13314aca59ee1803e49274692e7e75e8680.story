Coach driver Felicity Hall, 46, pleaded guilty to drink driving after she was spotted 'staggering around' Manchester Piccadilly station

A coach driver who was caught 'staggering around' a railway station just minutes before she was due to drive passengers home has been banned from the roads.

Felicity Hall, 46, was heard 'slurring' her words and openly admitted she had been drinking - despite the fact she was about to drive a coach full of passengers from Manchester Piccadilly railway station, a court has heard.

Hall, from Horwich, Greater Manchester, pleaded guilty to drink-driving after tests found she was more than twice over the legal limit.

Manchester Magistrates' Court heard Hall would have gone on to drive the coach while she was over the limit if another staff member had not raised the alarm.

Prosecutor Gareth Hughes also told how Hall, who had no previous convictions, had since been sacked by the company for which she worked, Atlantic Travel.

District Judge James Prowse told the 
defendant that the incident, which took place just after midnight on April 13, could have been very dangerous.

He said: 'Had this not been stopped there would have been passengers 
on board a bus driven by someone over the legal limit.'

Mr Hughes told the court how Hall was spotted pulling up in a coach, before getting out to talk to a station co-ordinator.

Hall was only stopped from driving the coach when staff at the station saw her 'stumbling around'. She then admitted she had been drinking

The co-ordinator's job was to direct passengers to the right coaches for their rail replacement services, the court was told.

When the co-ordinator asked Hall why she was there, she told the man she had been 'covering' for another coach which had not turned up, the court was told.

She then told the man she had been drinking and was seen 'staggering about'.

Mr Hughes said the coordinator then informed the British Transport Police.

Yasser Dean, managing director at Atlantic Travel, the company for which Hall worked, had also phoned the station co-ordinator to warn him about Hall's possible state.

Mr Dean said he had heard Hall 'slur her words' during a random telephone check.

Hall was arrested and later had a breath-test. Her reading was 81 micrograms of alcohol, the court heard. The legal limit is 35mg.

The district judge adjourned the hearing, warning Hall she would possibly be given a community sentence.

The judge warned her: 'Driving while disqualified is an extremely serious, imprisonable offence.

'The circumstances of this case I feel make it rather too serious to deal with simply with a financial penalty.'

Hall was handed an interim driving ban until the sentencing hearing on June 3.

Speaking after the hearing, Mr Dean said: 'Passenger safety is our paramount concern.'
