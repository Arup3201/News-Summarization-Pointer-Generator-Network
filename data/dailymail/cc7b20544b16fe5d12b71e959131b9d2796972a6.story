Suing: Gillian Drysdale blames her landlord after she slipped on steps. She broke her back and now walks with a stick

A woman who claims it was her landlord's fault she broke her back after falling down stairs is suing for a six-figure compensation payout.

Gillian Drysdale was carrying a 30 inch box and stepping backwards up the steps when she lost her footing during heavy rain in October 2008.

Ms Drysdale, who broke her back in the fall and now walks with a stick, claims her landlord Joanne Hedges should bear responsibility for her fall.

The 44-year-old mother attended the High Court today to sue Mrs Hedges, who owned the house in Harwich, Essex.

Ms Drysdale, who spent only one night in the house before the accident, says paint used on the steps made them slippery and there was no suitable handrail to stop her falling.

Lawyers representing Mrs Hedges, whose husband Steve Hedges had painted the steps leading up to the door of the Victorian property, are contesting liability on her behalf.

Michael Pooles QC for Mrs Hedges asked Ms Drysdale: ‘The real problem was that it was very, very wet and you were going up backwards?

‘You presumably weren’t looking where you were going?’

Giving evidence in court, Ms Drysdale, now of Diss, Norfolk, said she had moved to Harwich from Scotland the night before she fell.

With the removal driver desperate to get to Essex and back in one day, Ms Drysdale and her family were in a hurry to unload her belongings into the home.

She said she was watching her feet and 
moving up step-by-step but did not think the flight was dangerous until 
she slipped and fell over the side.

Proceedings: At the High Court (pictured) Ms Drysdale's barrister Niazi Fetto called an unguarded drop of eight ft on one side of the steps was 'unreasonable'

Her barrister, Niazi Fetto, said: ‘We say that, by putting smooth paint on steps that were naturally rough in texture and were exposed to the elements, the defendant was responsible for creating a risk and unreasonably and negligently so.

‘It was a risk that was manifestly foreseeable. 

‘What is more, it must be considered in relation to the potential severity of the consequences of that risk, that is, the virtually unguarded drop of eight feet to one side of the steps.

‘We say there was an obvious risk associated with steps anyway, these steps in particular, whether the paint made them smoother or more slippery or not.

‘It is unreasonable in the circumstances where there is a drop of over eight feet to one side not to erect some sort of guard or handrail against that risk.

‘The steps were outside. They’re liable to become dirty, as well as wet or frosty, and that adds to the level of risk that ought to be foreseen when, firstly, painting them so they become smoother and, in any event, when considering what might happen to someone using the steps.’

Deputy High Court Judge, John Leighton Williams QC, has now reserved his judgment on the case and will give his ruling at a later date.
