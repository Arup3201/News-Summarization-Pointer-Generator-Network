There will come a time, in a 100 years from now, when England supporters will cast their eyes over Wayne Rooney’s records and wonder what all the fuss was about.

Injury-permitting the England forward is on course to break Peter Shilton’s record of 125 caps some time in 2017 (at the very latest).

In the new year, when England’s head coach Roy Hodgson picks up again, Rooney will pass Sir Bobby Charlton’s goalscoring record before we are done with 2015. So what more do we want from Rooney?

The great Zlatan Ibrahimovic, who has played 101 times for his country and scored 51, is idolised and cherished by the good folk of Sweden.

Zlatan, unlike Rooney, has previously refused to play for Sweden over a disciplinary issue and also retired, briefly, from international football in October 2009. It did him no harm.

Rooney’s record of 46 goals in 101 international appearances is similar to the Swedish forward and yet our country remains divided about his contribution to the English game.

His performance in Scotland, where he scored twice in a 3-1 victory over Gordon Strachan’s team at Celtic Park, was masterful.

There is a maturity about his game. At 29, with the captain’s armband strapped to his left bicep, he has taken it upon himself to draw the best out of England’s emerging young players.

‘Sometimes results don’t go the way we want them to and people see it as if we don’t want to play four the country, but that’s far from the truth,’ he claimed.

‘We love coming to Scotland, we love playing for England. You have seen what it means to us and we are like that in every game.’

Rooney has had his moments, but if we are to make comparisons then Ibrahimovc has a rap sheet, all documented in his brilliant autobiography I Am Zlatan, that puts the England forward to shame. Ibrahimovic is no angel.

He has never scored a goal at a World Cup, either, but Ibrahimovic’s acolytes always gloss over that because Sweden is Sweden, right?

Rooney operates under different pressures with England and his detractors will always reference his disappointing record (one goal, in a 2-1 defeat against Uruguay in Sao Paulo at the 2014 World Cup) on the biggest stage of all.

If bringing home the Golden Boot from a World Cup really is the be-all-and-end-all about a player’s place in the game’s Hall of Fame, then we are duty bound to look back at the last few tournaments.

Since Rooney was born in Croxteth in 1985 there is only one striker in the game who has won as many league titles as Rooney during his career. That man was Hristo Stoichkov with Barcelona (5).

Whether or not you like Rooney, respect him or otherwise, there are few Golden Boot winners who have done it consistently for club and country since they made their international debuts.

The much-admired Gary Lineker, who scored six times during England’s run to the World Cup quarter-final at Mexico 86, never won a league title. After scoring 48 times for England, he enjoys legendary status.

At Italia 90 we fell in love with the Italian forward Toto Schillachi. He scored five at the tournament but never won a league title.

Russian forward Oleg Salenko, who scored six at the 1994 World Cup in the USA, won a league title with Dinamo Kiev.

Davor Suker, leading scorer at the 1998 World Cup, won one league title with Real Madrid. The Brazilian Ronaldo, who scored eight in 2002, won just one league title in Europe, with Real Madrid.

Miroslav Klose, who scored five for Germany at the 2006 World Cup, won two league titles with Bayern Munich.

Injury permitting, Rooney is on course to beat Peter Shilton's 125-cap record for England

Thomas Muller, top scorer in South Africa, has three DFB titles with Bayern Munich and will win countless more. James Rodriguez (Brazil 2014) won three league titles with Porto.

Some of the other issues, judging by the consistent reaction to Rooney on social media, is that the forward happens to play his club football with Manchester United.

It is there that Rooney has scored 219 goals in 450 appearances for since joining United just weeks after he announced himself to international football at Euro 2004.

He is third on the list of all-time leading scorers, just 18 behind Denis Law and 30 short of equalling Sir Bobby Charlton.

‘I can’t speak for him but if you ask me the records should be very important,’ claimed Hodgson after England had recorded their sixth successive victory in Scotland.

‘It must be nice for him to think he’ll see his name at the top of the list and a record number of caps is in sight too.’

After more than ten years at the top for club and country, it is time Rooney is given the credit he deserves.
