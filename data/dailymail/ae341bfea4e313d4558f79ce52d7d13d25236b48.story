Cristiano Ronaldo has blasted Jose Mourinho for creating a ‘bad atmosphere’ at Real Madrid during his troubled reign at the Bernabeu claiming ‘He’s no friend of mine’.

Mourinho endured an explosive tenure at the La Liga giants for three seasons between 2010-2013 and was forced to leave Madrid last summer after a trophyless season.

The Real Madrid superstar has slammed Mourinho, who is now at the helm at Chelsea, for his attitude towards the squad and fans.

'Difficult period': Real Madrid superstar Cristiano Ronaldo clashed with former manager Jose Mourinho

He told the Sun: ‘There was a bad atmosphere and it was a difficult period in personal terms.

‘There were situations with other players and also with the fans.’

Mourinho clashed with the Spanish press and also had public fall-outs with keeper Iker Casillas and current Manchester United midfielder Angel di Maria, which prompted fans to jeer the ‘Special One’ in his last season at the club.

Ronaldo added: ‘Of all my managers, the only one I have a friendship with is Sir Alex Ferguson. But I’m not in football to have friends. I’m here to win.’ 

Thanks: Despite a turbulent tenure at Madrid, some of the Bernabeu crowd were sad to see Mourinho leave
