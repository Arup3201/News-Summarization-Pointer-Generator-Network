Olympic skier Bode Miller opened up Thursday morning about his despair at how a custody battle with a former flame was portrayed in the press.

Miller told the 'Today Show' that it was difficult to see 11-month-old son Sam thrust into the spotlight while he and the boy's mother, former Marine Sara McKenna, 27, hammered out the details of a temporary custody agreement in place until at least a March 31 court date.

Miller, 36, spoke from Germany, where he is preparing for a World Cup event, that despite being accustomed to dealing with the press, it's much more difficult when it involves family.

It's difficult: Bode Miller claims the media spun his custody in a light that didn't reflect the facts of the case

'The real difficult part is anytime it’s family or things that are really personal,' the five-time gold medalist told the 'Today Show.' 'Reading about them is one thing, reading about them when they’re not true [is another].

'When they’re completely spun in one direction all the time and having to just accept that and not fight a public battle because that’s what the media really thrives on,' Miller continued, 'That was really difficult.'

Miller griped that the media used 'a tiny amount of information' to come to far different conclusions than family court judges did, and that the press narrative put a defenseless child in an unfortunate position.

'When it’s about a small child who can’t really defend themselves or is going to have to deal with the repercussions of that in the future, that’s a really tough thing to deal with,' Miller said.

Difficult: Miller said that despite his being used to dealing with the media, it's much harder when family matters are portrayed inaccurately

Defenseless: Miller also griped that his son was unfairly thrust into the spotlight and put into a position of having to deal with the ramifications of that in the future

The skier also spoke about looking forward to what will likely be his final Olympics, saying he feels his age and that he has to work harder to keep up with the younger skiers after knee surgery.

He did add though, that going to the games with expectations lower than a medal is not why he's hitting the slopes.

'Anything outside of the medals is not why you’re going there,' Miller said.

His comments came one month to the day after the details of a custody agreement between he and McKenna were made public.

The temporary custody agreement in place until at least March 31 allows the skier to take the child to
 the Winter Olympics next month in Russia.

Miller
 and McKenna had a brief relationship last year in California but he has
 since married professional volleyball player Morgan Beck.

The case became a cause for women's rights advocates after a judge castigated McKenna for moving while pregnant to New York. She's studying at Columbia University.

The boy, who Miller calls Nathaniel in honor of his late younger brother, will spend time with his mother while she pursues her studies.

Case referee Fiordaliza Rodriguez of the Manhattan Family Court approved the agreement, issuing a temporary order after a short conference in her courtroom.

'I'm happy to see that both parties are working this out,' Rodriguez said, according to the New York Daily News.

The child was not present at the courthouse.

Happy: Miller, 36, and McKenna, 27, said, separately, after court they were happy about the arrangement, which allows the skier to take the child to the Olympics in February in Russia

McKenna has had temporary custody of Sam since November while Miller was away in Canada and Colorado seeking to qualify for his fifth Olympics.

The child attended his father's season opener in Austria in October, when Miller had temporary custody.

The former lovers met through an online dating service in California and went on several dates before McKenna discovered she was pregnant.

By the time she informed him of the pregnancy, Miller was already seeing Beck, who is now his wife.

Some have defended McKenna's New York move after Rodriquez dubbed it irresponsible because it moved the case to a different legal forum.

The news comes after Beck said it was 'fate' that she had a miscarriage earlier this year because they wouldn't have been able to spend as much time with the 11-month-old toddler.

McKenna was awarded temporary custody of her young son over the Thanksgiving holiday, before the bitter exes and their legal teams got back in a Manhattan court last month.

Airing their views: Bode Miller and his wife Morgan Beck, who he married shortly after ending his relationship with Sara McKenna, announced that she miscarried last January

Holding on tight: Just before Thanksgiving, a judge overturned the previous custody ruling that gave the Millers the rights to the child he had with Sara McKenna (pictured), allowing her to care for the child until December 9

Miller met McKenna through the high-end dating service after they both expressed interest in settling down.

Their relationship didn't last long, however, but McKenna discovered she was pregnant with his child by the time he had already begun dating his now-wife Morgan Beck, a professional volleyball player.

McKenna later released a text she sent to Miller after asking him to join her at an ultrasound appointment. He refused to go and wrote: 'U made this choice against my wish'.

In October, McKenna warned Miller that there was a possibility that she would be moving across the country: 'Just a heads up, I met with an advisor from Columbia today and we will probably be moving there in the fall.'

That same month, he married Beck after dating for just five months and in November he submitted a 'Petition to Establish Parental Relationship' in a California court, identifying himself as the father of a child who was not yet born.

Miller and Beck announced that she was pregnant weeks later, only to reveal shortly after that she had a miscarriage.

'It was awful. Morgan and I hadn't planned on getting pregnant, but we were excited. In hindsight, now, we can see what an incredible challenge having two babies would have been. I don't believe in fate- that everything happens for a reason- but Morgan does,' Miller said in an interview with Us Weekly, a portion of which is online.

That reason is the fact that they want to gain more legal access to Miller's son with McKenna, even though the relationship has grown so contentious that they refer to the boy using different names.

McKenna calls him Sam after giving the boy Miller's legal name, Samuel Bode Miller-McKenna, when she gave birth to him in New York last February.

Fighting for his son: Miller and his wife had custody of the boy, who they refer to as Nate while his mother calls him Sam, for months leading up to the reversal before Thanksgiving

Evolving: Morgan, a professional volleyball player, got pregnant expectantly but had a miscarriage shortly after announcing it

Miller later petitioned a court in his home state of California to add Nathaniel as a middle name in honor of his brother who died in April. Now he and Beck refer to the boy as Nate.

The couple argued that McKenna had been conducting a virtual smear campaign against them, and while they maintain that they have not fought back, they are changing their ways now because it will effect the skier's career as he trains for the Winter Olympics.

Her strike back: McKenna posted multiple photos of she and 'Sam' over Thanksgiving, including this one of them at the Macy's parade

Miller told The Boston Globe earlier that McKenna is directly attacking his brand.

'(McKenna has) been directly attacking that. It's so pointless in this case because it has no bearing on anything. It doesn't make any difference,' he told the paper.

'It's just, when you are in a position where things aren't going your way — my wife does it all the time if she's losing a fight or something, she just switches the fight to something else that she thinks she can win at. Just totally changes the argument to something else. It's not a bad tactic. It's just kind of pointless.'

Other factors weighed in on the argument, however, turning the case into a question of women's rights as one New York judge initially ruled that McKenna was 'forum shopping' for more favorable courts by moving from California in her third trimester. He awarded custody to Miller.

After that September 3 decision, McKenna told The New York Times that her ex and new wife wasted no time uprooting the boy as they came back to her apartment 'took the baby out of my arms, dropped it in a car seat and drove away.'

A second judge then reversed that decision though the case is still ongoing with the next hearing due for March 31.

The Millers arrived at the Manhattan court with 'Nate' in tow last week and McKenna took the child after the hearing as she was granted custody over the Thanksgiving holiday.

Bi-coastal contention: After meeting Miller in San Diego, McKenna moved to New York when she was pregnant and gave birth to the boy there, but the Millers argue she moved to be in a more favorable state for the custody case

She posted photos of she and 'Sam' together in New York, including one of the pair attending the Thanksgiving Day parade.

Even though he didn't have his son near him to post new photos, Miller didn't let the social media war stay put there: he posted an old photo of 'Nate' and Dace, his 5-year-old daughter from another previous relationship.

He and Morgan had discussed online how they were celebrating an 'early' Christmas in Colorado, and the picture of 'Nate' and Dace read: 'She's super sad her brother isn't here to celebrate with us.'
