The breathtaking rise to prominence of Marina Granovskaia appears set to continue after Chelsea’s chief executive Ron Gourlay left the club on Wednesday. 

Gourlay has agreed to move on amicable terms after a decade at Stamford Bridge, including serving the last five years as chief executive. 

He has been focused almost entirely on the commercial aspects of the role in the recent past and the quest to meet UEFA’s Financial Fair Play targets, cut losses and improve the club’s image on a global scale.

'Chelsea Football Club announces that Ron Gourlay, after 10 successful years at the club including five as chief executive, is leaving Chelsea in order to pursue new business opportunities.

'The club, and in particular the owner (Roman Abramovich) and directors, wish to thank Ron for his many years of service to Chelsea and support his desire to seek new challenges.

'Ron's efforts have helped the club to achieve its position as one of the leading football clubs in the world.

'Pending additional appointments, chairman Bruce Buck and director Marina Granovskaia will assume additional executive responsibilities.'

During this time Granovskaia, 39, a Canadian and Russian national, has gradually emerged as the most influential figure in the executive tier of the club and the voice of owner Roman Abramovich on the ground. 

She is trusted implicitly by Abramovich, having advised him and his companies for 17 years since graduating from Moscow State University.

As Gourlay started to turn his attention towards the commercial end of the business, Granovskaia became the pivotal figure in transfer and contract negotiations and a far more familiar face around Stamford Bridge. 

She was central to Jose Mourinho’s return from Real Madrid and to big-money transfers such as Diego Costa’s £32million move from Atletico Madrid. 

Her style is perhaps best described as polite but firm, although there are stories that it went a little further than that during John Terry’s contract talks.

Granovskaia was often visible on the ground in Holland as links with Vitesse Arnhem were strengthened and a new training complex was built, although she is rarely seen in Arnhem now and the links between the clubs are no longer quite so strong. 

Over recent years, any agents turning up to meetings at the Bridge or Chelsea’s training ground in Surrey would find Granovskaia driving the meetings, increasingly active and influential at the heart of the club with a good relationship with technical director Michael Emenalo.

Last year, her rise to power was made official when she was confirmed on the board of both the football club and the PLC. In the short term, Gourlay’s responsibilities will be shared between Granovskaia and chairman Bruce Buck, and in the longer term, the club may consider employing a commercial specialist to replace Gourlay, rather than a traditional CEO.

'It has been a privilege to have played a role in the club's considerable achievements both on and off the pitch over the last 10 years, but I feel the time is right to move on to other challenges.

'I would like to thank Mr Abramovich, the directors, the manager and players and all the staff for their support during my time at the club, and wish them much continued success in the future.'

Gourlay’s announcement came without warning, although it emerged that plans had been unfolding for some time. 

The Scot watched Chelsea’s 6-0 win in the Champions League on Tuesday before attending a UEFA meeting and sharing a drink with colleagues. 

He was at the Bridge on Wednesday tidying up loose ends, but leaves with immediate effect ‘in order to pursue new business opportunities’, according to a statement released by Chelsea.

‘The club, and in particular the owner and directors, wish to thank Ron for his many years of service to Chelsea and support his desire to seek new challenges,’ the statement added. ‘Ron’s efforts have helped the club to achieve its position as one of the leading football clubs in the world.’

He took over in September 2009, stepping up from his role as chief operating officer to replace Peter Kenyon, with whom he had also worked at Umbro. 

Among his first tasks was an attempt to secure naming rights for Stamford Bridge, which went down terribly with Chelsea fans and never came to fruition.

On a more positive note, the team won the Champions League on his watch, and recorded a small profit in 2012 — perhaps an even more remarkable achievement, all things considered. He did manage to increase revenue from sponsorship deals such as those with adidas, Gazprom and Delta, while wrestling with the problem posed by the 42,000 capacity at the ground and complications involved in expanding or finding a suitable site for a new home.

‘It has been a privilege to have played a role in the club’s considerable achievements both on and off the pitch over the last 10 years, but I feel the time is right to move on to other challenges,’ said Gourlay in a statement.

‘I would like to thank Mr Abramovich, the directors, the manager and players and all the staff for their support during my time at the club, and wish them much continued success in the future.’
