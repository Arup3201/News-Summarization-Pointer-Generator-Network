A mother and her 21-year-old son from Albuquerque, New Mexico were arrested after posting a picture of a puppy in a freezer bag on Facebook.

The photo shows Mary Snell, 44, holding an 8-week-old puppy in an open plastic bag.

Investigators from the Bernalillo County Sheriff's Office said Snell then posted it on her son, James Engel's, Facebook page. Both face charges of animal cruelty.

Danger of suffocation: Investigators say the dog could have easily have died because it wasn't able to lift its head up to breathe fresh oxygen

'They got a new puppy and were trying to show how small the dog was in comparison to a Ziploc bag.

The dog was moving around and to restrict its movement. Ms. Snell thought that it would be a good idea to put the dog in the bag,' Sgt. Aaron Williamson said.

Snell placed the pup, called Baby into a Ziploc bag to show how small he was while her son took the picture.

Investigators said the dog was positioned in a way that it could have suffocated because the dogs head was stuck in the corner of the plastic bag.

'She did admit it was wrong, but she couldn't get the dog to sit still, so she did it anyway,' Williamson said. 'A young puppy doesn't have the ability to move its head to a fresh supply of oxygen.'

Arrested: Mary Snell, 44, and her son James Engel, 21, have been arrested and charged with animal cruelty

Investigators found out about the photo after it was forwarded to them by someone who was concerned about the welfare of the puppy.

A neighbor said that the family treats their pets well. 'I've seen them outside with their animals and they do pretty good,' said a neighbor who didn't want to be identified.

The puppy was taken to a vet to be looked at and was apparently dine. Baby is now is being taken care of by one of Snell's relatives.
