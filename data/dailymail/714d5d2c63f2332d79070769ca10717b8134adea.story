The assault case against Liverpool footballer Raheem Sterling collapsed today when his former girlfriend gave 'disappointing' evidence to support the prosecution's case.

Sterling, 18, was alleged to have attacked 19-year-old model Shana Ann Rose Halliday following a row about a text message, Liverpool Magistrates' Court heard.

Jamaican-born Sterling, from Southport, was formally found not guilty by magistrates when the Crown Prosecution Service withdrew its case after magistrates refused to treat Miss Halliday as a hostile witness.

Not guilty: Raheem Sterling was tried for assault at Liverpool Magistrates' Court

He entered a not guilty plea at Liverpool Magistrates’ Court last month, having been arrested on August 8 following an incident in Page Moss, Huyton, Liverpool.

He was granted conditional bail and arrived 
at the same court last Friday afternoon for the start of his trial.

Anthony Leo, Chairman of the bench, said Miss Halliday had given 'unfavourable evidence'.

Miss Halliday, from Liverpool, was crowned the winner of England’s Top Model of the World beauty pageant earlier this year.

She went on to contest the pageant’s world final in Egypt and reportedly works as a sales assistant for the Hollister clothing chain.

Miss Halliday appeared at Liverpool Magistrates Court today and gave evidence from behind a screen.

She
said: 'We had a heated argument because I seen a text message on his 
phone. It started because I was trying to get his phone.

We just kept arguing. We were just name calling. I started it.

'Ten
minutes after we left the restaurant we stopped at a service station. 
When we got back, he told me to get out of the car and I said I wasn't 
because it was raining.

'He said you've got to get out of the car. He pushed me and said I'm done.

'I pushed and shoved his chest and hands and he pushed and shoved my arm and back.'

Sara Drysdale, prosecuting, made an application to the bench asking for the complainant to be 'treated as a hostile witness'.

She said: 'The crown would say that Miss Halliday has demonstrated an unwillingness to tell the truth about what has happened.'

She
said Miss Halliday, who gave evidence to the court behind a screen, had
given 'conflicting accounts' to her previous statements to the police 
and which also differed from her original 999 call to the police on the 
night in question.

At times Miss Halliday failed to answer prosecution questions and was often so quiet she was inaudible.

But Stuart Driver QC, defending, said the prosecution was engaging in a 'straw-clutching exercise'.

Mr
Driver added: 'She has given evidence, slowly but in detail, and it's 
unfavourable to the prosecution case. She is far from being a hostile 
witness.'

Anthony Leo, 
chairman of the bench, told the court: 'Although she is an unfavourable 
witness for the prosecution, she is not hostile.'

After the bench made its decision, Miss Drysdale said there was 'no longer a realistic prospect of conviction'.

Top player: Liverpool winger Sterling is a key member of the England under-21 team

The England under-21 international trained with the Liverpool squad this morning before going to court.

Reports
suggest that the couple where driving when the assault began and his 
black Range Rover Evoque came to a screeching halt, before the 
altercation continued in the street.

The
couple had earlier been celebrating her 20th birthday with a meal out 
and the row is understood to have taken place afterwards.

On the night Sterling was arrested he wrote on Twitter: 'This food is getting dealt with,' before posting pictures of his meal.

Miss
Halliday was crowned the winner of England's Top Model of the World 
earlier this year before contesting the world final in Egypt.

The
Liverpool winger, who joined the Reds in 2010, scored in his side's 4-2
Capital One Cup Second Round win over Notts County last month.

He also netted in England under 21s 6-0 thrashing of Scotland only days after the alleged incident.

The
winger could feature for Brendan Rodgers' men who look to maintain 
their unbeaten start to the season when they take on Southampton at 
Anfield tomorrow.

A spokesman for Liverpool Football Club 
said: 'This is a private matter for Raheem and as such we will not be 
making any further comment.'
