Inter Milan manager Roberto Mancini has stepped up his charm offensive in an attempt to spark a move for Manchester City midfielder Yaya Toure.

The former City manager wants to bring Toure to Milan after his spell as boss of the Ivorian midfielder powerhouse at the Etihad Stadium between 2010 and 2013.

And Mancini has cheekily hinted that Toure would fancy a move to Italy after a difficult season with City chasing Chelsea in the Barclays Premier League title race.

'Yaya has played in every top League, apart from Germany and Italy,' Mancini said.

'If, as it seems, he wants to have an experience in Italy, then there is this possibility he could come here.

'It won’t be easy, but he’s a player with incredible technique and character. Would Inter be his first choice? That’s certain.'

Toure has two years left on his City contract, and there seems no chance that the Premier League champions would be interested in selling a star player and part of the spine of Manuel Pellegrini's team.

And Pellegrini has spoken out previously to confirm that Toure will not be leaving - not that it's stopping Mancini.

Last month Pellegrini said: 'I don’t have an opinion about what another manager says about Yaya.

'Of course, every manager of every team would want Yaya in their team but I don’t have anything to say about that.'

Toure rues a missed chance for City - and he has struggled to match their usual standards at times this year

And Mancini certainly seems interested in his former players, having also tried to sign City youth product from Fiorentina, where he is on loan, in January.

'We did try to get him, as he was my player at City,' Mancini told Gazzetta TV. 'Fiorentina seemed open to it, but the move didn’t go through.' 

Mancini's Inter are struggling in Serie A this season and face missing out on Champions League football again, with the Nerazzurri sitting ninth in the table.
