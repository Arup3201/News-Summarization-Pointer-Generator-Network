The birth of a much-wanted child is always a special occasion but for Justine Smithies, 41, the birth of her second grandchild proved more memorable than most.

For the last time a grandchild of Justine's came into the world, she was still trapped unhappily in the male body she was born with.

Sadly, Justine's joy at becoming a grandmother again and at finally completing sex change surgery was tinged with tragedy, as just months ago, her 15-year-old son, Cameron, lost his life after falling from a cliff face.

Commitment: Julie is Justine's former wife and the pair hope to remarry once the government's new same sex marriage bill is enacted

'We are overjoyed,' said Justine, who lives with her former wife and partner of 22 years, Julie, 39. 'We think our son Cameron is watching over Harrison. He would have been made-up to be an uncle again.'

Tragically, Cameron fell to his death the day after predicting that his sister Samantha's newest child would be a boy.

Marine electronics engineer Justine, who
also has another daughter, Morgan, 12, with Julie said: 'I remember 
Cameron saying, "It's going to be a hyperactive ginger boy".

'After his passing we took Samantha to get a scan and that's when they told us that it was a very active, wriggly boy.

'It
was as if Cameron had really known. All that was left was to discover 
was his hair colour. Well now he's here and his hair does have a ginger 
tinge.'

The couple, who hope to remarry under the UK's newly introduced same-sex marriage bill and live in Cruden Bay, Aberdeenshire, already have a granddaughter, Harmony, two.

'Though my surgery earlier this year to become a woman made me feel complete, even when Harmony was born I saw myself as female,' explained Justine.

'I was always granny to her. Both my grandchildren have brought happy tears to my eyes - there was a time, as a man, that I never ever thought I would be able to be my true self.'

Throughout her challenging transgender journey Justine has had the support of her partner and their children, after finally revealing her need to be female five years ago following a lifetime of silence.

Cameron's death just weeks after the surgery, and Harrison's birth, has seen their strong family bond blossom further.

Cameron had been thrilled to learn his two mums planned to remarry under new same-sex laws and said he wanted to walk them both down the aisle.

And his 19-year-old sister Samatha adores them just as much, as does Samantha's partner, Shaun Donaldson, 22, with whom she lives in Peterhead.

'Harrison's birth wasn't easy,' Samantha said. 'The cord was presenting first. I had to have an emergency caesarean and was scared for his life and my own.

'Both my mums were there for me. Justine and Shaun were at the hospital, Julie looked after Harmony.

'Only Shaun could go into theatre with me. I was in tears when I said goodbye to Justine. She was scared and nervous, too. I felt Cameron with me then.'

But all went well and Harrison was born weighing 6lbs 13oz. Samantha said: 'I think Cameron was watching out for him, giving him that extra chance.

'We have a wonderful family and I've never been so proud of my parents. They have been through more tough times than most people, yet they still love each other.

'It's great having two mums. I can talk to them about anything and we're all over the moon that we have Harrison.'

The Smithies are now making plans for Christmas. Justine said: 'It is going to be hard without Cameron but we'll still celebrate it and talk about what he would have done or said, funny or sad.

'We'll never forget him. Samantha and Shaun and will be at ours with the children for the festivities.

'That's what families do. We love them all. I couldn't think of having Christmas any other way.'
