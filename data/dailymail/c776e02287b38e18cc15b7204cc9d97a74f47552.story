The ongoing eruptions from Indonesia's volcano Mount Sinabung have blanketed the nearby small town of Berastagi in tons of volcanic ash.

Pictures from the rural north Sumatra village show rooftops and streets covered in the harmful substance, which is made up of tiny fragments of jagged rock, minerals, and volcanic glass.

The 2,460-metre volcano has been issuing frequent small to medium explosions of hot ash, lava and gases – which spread out to around five kilometres - since September last year, leading to the evacuation of almost 25,000 people.

Those who remain in the city are seen covering their faces with masks and scarves as they brave the abandoned streets and the toxic ash which can damage a person's lungs and cause suffocation.

In August, the volcano erupted after lying dormant for 400 years, killing at least two people and displacing 30,000 others. An eruption in February this year killed 16 people.

The latest series of eruptions began on October 5, forcing hundreds of people to leave their homes. In January this year, a number of explosions forced thousands of residents across three districts to flee their homes after ash spread as far as 35km, The Jakarta Post reported 

Mount Sinabung is now among about 130 active volcanoes in Indonesia. The country is prone to seismic upheaval due to its location on the Pacific Ring of Fire, an arc of volcanoes and fault lines encircling the Pacific Basin. 

But despite volcanoes being notoriously hard to predict, it is difficult to keep farmers away because the slopes of the mountains are highly fertile.

In 2010, 324 people were killed over two months when Indonesia's most volatile volcano, Mount Merapi, roared into life.

It can be very harmful to animals and humans and is well know for causing lung problems and suffocation 

Over 25,000 thousand people have been evacuated since the volcano became active again in 2010
