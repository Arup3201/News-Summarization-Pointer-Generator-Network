Former referees chief Keith Hackett has criticised the decision that could see the Premier League's oldest ever referee take charge of a game on opening weekend.

Nigel Miller has been appointed as fourth official for Sunderland's visit to West Brom on Saturday, despite being 51 years old - and could find himself as the man in the middle if Neil Swarbrick gets injured.

And Hackett says that Professional Game Match Officials Limited, who choose the officials for each top flight game, are taking big risks with referees more likely to pick up injuries at the start of the new season.

Too old? Keith Hackett has raised concerns about the appointment of Nigel Miller as fourth official

Unconvinced:  Hackett used to be head of referees and has criticised the PGMOL ahead of the new season

'The Premier League throws up that danger more than any other due to the speed and intensity of the games, which will expose any pull or strain that a referee might be carrying,' Hackett said in his You are the ref column. 

'I believe too much risk is being taken by the PGMOL management team.'

All Premier League refs have to pass an intensive fitness test to take charge of top flight matches - and Miller is not one of the 17 members of the FA's Select Group of Referees.

'(Miller) will in my opinion have difficulty in meeting the minimum 1000m at 7m per second sprint values or even get anywhere near the thirty plus sprints required to be produced to maintain contact with a Premier League game,' Hackett added. 

'Why is the PGMOL not appointing its select group referees to all double up over the opening weekend?

'Will Mr Miller, born in 1960, be able to cope with the speed and intensity requirements of a Premier League game should he have to come on?

'I have my doubts…. so why expose the Premier League games to such a high-risk strategy by not getting the select group Referees to double up?'
