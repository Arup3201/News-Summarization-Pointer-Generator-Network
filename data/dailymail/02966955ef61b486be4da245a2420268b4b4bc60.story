A young family diced with death after pitching their tent at the foot of an unstable 150ft cliff just yards from where a holidaymaker was killed by falling rocks.

Shocked beachgoers spotted a couple with a toddler emerging from the tiny dome tent underneath cliffs at Burton Bradstock, Dorset.

The family ignored warning signs and spent the night camping illegally on the stone beach less than 24 hours after a landslide at nearby East Cliff at West Bay.

Danger zone: A family ignored clear warning signs to pitch a tent at the foot an unstable 150ft cliff - just metres from where a holidaymaker was killed by falling rocks

The campers were just down the beach from where Charlotte Blackman, 22, was killed by a 400-tonne landslide a year ago.

The couple pitched their tent within feet of a sign reading 'Danger - rockfalls. Serious risk of injury or death. Stay away from the cliffs'.

Overnight camping is banned on the Jurassic Coast's beaches as they are owned by the National Trust.

Walker Doug Randle, 58, from Weymouth, took a photograph after seeing a man and a woman emerge from the tent with a toddler.

He
 said: 'I was aware of the recent landslip at West Bay so I was so 
surprised to see a couple, along with their small child, camping 
underneath these unstable cliffs.

'Without a doubt this family was dicing with death and risking their lives.

'I couldn't believe what I was seeing.

'They emerged unhurried and seemingly oblivious to the potentially lethal situation they had been in.

'They were camping right next to signs telling them there is a risk of serious injury or death.

'I
 wish I'd gone up to them and said: 'why didn't you see the signs?' I 
can't believe that even if they arrived in the dark they didn't have 
enough illumination to see the signs.'

Businessman Mr Randle was waiting for 
the Hive Beach Cafe to open along with his partner Maureen Joyce, 60, 
when he spotted the tent.

Miss
 Joyce added: 'You could see that the base of the cliff was further back
 than the top of the cliff and there has been erosion.

'There is a very dangerous overhang of the cliff.

'I don't know what else can be done to safeguard some people from themselves.'

A Portland Coastguard spokesman reissued the warning about people staying away from unstable areas of cliffs after landslips.

He said: 'Do not camp anywhere close to the cliff face - the whole of the coastline is extremely fragile.

'If you are going to walk along the beach, walk along the shoreline.

'Enjoy it, but be conscious that it's fragile.'

As if to illustrate the serious dangers for anyone lingering under the cliffs, coastguards have issued a warning to holidaymakers after a cliff fall at the 'vulnerable' section of coast in at West Bay in Dorset.

Heavy rainfall at the end of last week is thought to have made the land unstable and crumbly, the Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) said.

No-one was injured in the landslip, which happened near Freshwater Beach Holiday Park on Friday and has left the cliff with an overhang.

An MCA spokesman said: 'Some sections of the coast around the UK are particularly vulnerable to cliff falls and landslips.

'HM Coastguard is again advising the public to take great care when walking on cliff paths or along beaches, and take note of any warning signs in place.'

Dorset County Council's emergency planning department was informed of the cliff fall and is investigating.
