Nigel Hague, 85, completed the wing-walk while on a 45 minute flight from France to England, raising more than £50,000 for charity

The 85-year-old father of Foreign Secretary William Hague strapped himself to the top of a bi-plane and wing-walked over the English Channel in his latest daredevil challenge for charity.

Nigel Hague completed the hair-raising stunt to raise over £50,000 for the the Lost Chord charity.

The octogenarian was in France as a personal tribute to those who lost their lives in the D-Day military operation - beginning the daring wing walk in Calais and arriving 45 minutes later in Kent.

Since he turned 80, Nigel has raised almost £200,000 for the NSPCC with a series of challenges. His first wing walk was in May 2012, and raised £59,000.

Speaking after his latest challenge Nigel, of Harley, South Yorks., said: 'When you get to my age you’re not really afraid of anything, although I have to admit doing a wing walk across the Channel is quite a challenge.

'The whole thing went fine, the weather was absolutely perfect for it. The only real problem was a fly that got caught in my googles for about ten minutes.

'It is a an exhilarating experience, but not completely pleasant, and isn’t as dangerous as mountain climbing, I think.

'I was busy working most of my life, with no time to indulge in climbing mountains and other things, it’s all been done in later life.

'My wife said to me "If you’re fool enough to be climbing mountains, it’s time to do it for charity". Since then I’ve done sky dives, climbed Scafell Pike and abseiled down a high building, so I guess I’m I doing okay for 85.'

He says his son laughs about his endeavours, and thinks he’s 'a bit nutty'.

The stunt is Nigel's second wing-walk. The first, completed in May 2012, raised £59,000 for the NSPCC

Nigel insisted that wing-walking was not as dangerous as mountain climbing - which he has also done for charity - but admitted his son William Hague thought his antics were 'a bit nutty'

Nigel added: 'He was in Normandy at the D-Day commemorations with the Queen. I said I might swing down there and give him the V-sign and he said if you do you might get a missile up your backside as its a no-fly zone.'

Nigel’s first high profile challenge came at the age of 80 in 2009, when he climbed the 3,209ft Scafell Pike peak in seven-and-a-half hours and raised £51,000.

This was followed by a 10,000ft skydive in August 2011, and his first wing-walk in May 2012- which combined raised more than £100,000.

His latest challenge was for Lost Chord, which operates throughout the UK, visiting 130 residential care homes and day centres a month.

The charity aims to improve the quality of life of dementia sufferers using interactive stimuli.

Helena Muller, Managing Director of Lost Chord, said: 'We are extremely grateful to Nigel for his support over the years, particularly at the moment as we are surviving on reserves.

Nigel has completed two wing-walks, climbed a mountain and done a skydive for charity, raising £200,000

'The wing walk event was fantastic and, with the help of S3 ID, we raised a fantastic amount of money for our charity.

'It’s just inconceivable to think that a man at 85 should even consider the death defying feat of being strapped to a bi-plane and hanging on for dear life while it flies all the way to England.

'All those brave soldiers, had they survived, would have been in awe of Nigel’s antics.'Rotherham-based S3 ID Ltd sponsored the wing walk.

Derek Gennard, Director at S3 ID, said: 'Nigel has raised a huge amount of money for charity over the years and we were delighted to support him in his latest adventure.

'He has always been happy to help others and we congratulate him on raising these much needed funds for Lost Chord.'
