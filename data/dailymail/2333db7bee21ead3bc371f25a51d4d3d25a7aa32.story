A military buff who owns 20,000 toy soldiers and 600 model aircrafts in what is believed to be one of Britain's largest collections of Second World War memorabilia wants to open a museum - because his wife says the house has become 'too full'.

Paul Andrassy, 59, has spent nearly 50 years amassing the £70,000 hoard, which includes 700 model military vehicles, 40 real and de-activated guns, grenades, badges, and even a reproduction flame thrower.

But now his wife Zoe, 48, whom he married last year in a 1940s-style ceremony - complete with a guard of honour - said he needs to remove the collection from their home in Sheffield.

Paul Andrassy, 59, has spent nearly 50 years amassing one of Britain's biggest collection of Second World War memorabilia at his home in Sheffield 

But the Second World War buff, pictured above in a U.S uniform, is now looking to open a museum to house the collection, after his wife Zoe said the house was 'too full'

His stash - which includes three bazookas and 13 full sized mannequins dressed in various uniforms - has become so big that she cannot even draw the curtains in their sitting room.

She said: 'I don't really mind it that much. My dad was the same, he was a squadron leader in the RAF and he had lots of wartime memorabilia too, but he had to keep his in the loft.

'But the house is getting too full now. I would like to have enough room be able to draw the curtains in the sitting room.'  

Mr Andrassy, who has seven children, first began collecting the memorabilia when he was aged 10. His family collected tokens from boxes of washing powder Oxydol and sent off for free toy soldiers.

He soon began making models and eventually expanded his passion until he owned everything from webbing and ammunition to flags and badges.

He said: 'I started collecting when I was ten when my family would collect tokens from Oxydol (washing powder of the day) boxes and send off for free toy soldiers. 

His £70,000 hoard, which started with free toys from washing powder, includes 600 model aircraft hanging from the ceiling, pictured left, 700 model military vehicles, 40 real and de-activated guns, grenades, webbing, ammunition, flags, badges hours of battlefield film footage and life-sized mannequins, pictured right

'Then I started making models and I have always been fascinated by the second world war. Once you get through the Frog and Airfix models you have to start looking abroad for new stuff, I got a lot from Russia.'

Now, at the couple's semi-detached house, model aircraft hangs from every ceiling in the house, while walls are papered in wartime propaganda posters, pictures and newspaper cuttings. Mr Andrassy also has hours and hours of battlefield footage.

He said: 'I admit it's is getting a bit full now. I don't want to glorify war and all that went with it but its history and its my hobby. What I would like to do now is to get together with some like-minded people and create a museum in Sheffield. 

Mr Andrassy married his wife Zoe last year wearing full 1940s gear, complete with a cheering crowd and a guard of honour

'If a group of us with similar interests could find each other we could perhaps apply for lottery funding and put all the stuff under one roof where people could go and see it. I think a lot of people would find it fascinating.' 

Mr Andrassy, a butcher, put a note in the paper shop window near his work asking for Second World War memorabilia for the museum. He said people now bring in items all the time.

He added that the recent upsurge in interest in both of the world wars means a surge in the price of memorabilia, raising the estimate of his collection to around £70,000 - although he said he would never sell it.  

Mr Andrassy said he was unable to give exact amounts for the different categories of his collection because he had 'lots and lots of everything'.

He said he has hundreds of posters, cuttings and pictures, as well as 13 mannequins in full uniform, including two U.S paratroopers of the 101st Airborne, a British Engineer, a Desert Rat, a German paratrooper and an SS uniform. He also seven German soldiers uniforms waiting to go on display.

Mr Andrassy said the German machine guns in his collection would be some of the priciest items at a cost of around £1,400 each.

Mr Andrassy believes his vast collection would be worth up to £70,000 but says he has no intention of ever selling his memorabilia 

But there are still some things which he has not managed to collect, including a blank-firing German machine gun

He added that the Russian machine guns are are also expensive but many of his items are increasing in value as they get rarer.

From the allied side, he has British Lee Enfield rifles and Bren guns. He has collected a U.S 'Grease Gun', Thompson machine guns and carbines. He also has Russian small arms in the collection. From the German side he has rifles, Schmeisser machine guns and heavy machine guns. 

The war buff, whose father was an RAF pilot, and his friends are also involved in the re-enactment of famous Second World War battles. Mr Andrassy is also enrolled in the 82nd US Airborn division. 

He said: 'We go all over the place and have a great time recreating the battles. We love it and the crowds love it - and everyone knows who's going to win. We have SS uniforms and we dress in those at appropriate meetings but not everywhere allows them. 

'In Germany they are not allowed to do any re-enactment of the war and German people who are into it come over here to do it.

'One time we went to a re-enactment day in Scarborough in SS uniforms and someone came quietly up to us and told us we would not be allowed in wearing them. We didn't know that but we knew that some places dont allow them. It wasnt a problem.'

Despite his huge collections, there are still some items that the fanatic has not managed to source.

He said: 'A blank-firing German machine gun is something that everyone wants, they are so beautifully made and you should hear the sound of one.

'I would love a Willys Jeep but they cost a fortune. One bloke who is in to re-enactment group has bought one and he's restoring it but I don't think I'll ever be able to have one of those. Hopefully with a museum we can look at bigger items because I just don't have the room.'
