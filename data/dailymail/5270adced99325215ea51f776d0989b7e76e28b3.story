An Indian bride ended up marrying a guest at her own wedding after her husband-to-be suffered an epileptic fit during the ceremony.

Groom Jugal Kishore was just about to exchange vows when he collapsed with a seizure and was rushed to hospital.

Angry that she had not been informed of his condition, the 23-year-old bride, Indira, asked a member of her brother-in-law's family, Harpal Singh, to marry her instead.

Mr Singh, who was wearing jeans and a leather jacket, was caught off guard, but agreed to go ahead with the wedding.

After the ceremony, Mr Kishore returned to the venue after being treated in hospital to find that his fiancee had married someone else, it was reported by The Times of India.

Mr Kishore is said to have begged Indira to reconsider, saying that he could not face his family and friends after her humiliating snub.

When she refused, violence is said to have broken out between the two families, with cutlery and plates being thrown at each other.

The incident took place in Rampur town in the northern Indian state of Uttar Pradesh (above, file picture)

Mr Kishore and his family later filed a complaint with police which was later retracted.

Police chief RP Solanki said: 'Both families have amicably resolved the matter.

'The complaints have been withdrawn. Kishore and his family have now returned in peace to Moradabad.'

The incident took place in Rampur town in the northern Indian state of Uttar Pradesh.
