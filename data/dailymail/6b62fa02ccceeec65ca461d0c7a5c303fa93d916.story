The number of U.S. cases of West Nile virus has climbed by nearly a third in the last week, it emerged last night.

The spread of the mosquito-borne disease accelerated and threatened to make the 2012 outbreak among the most severe on record, government figures show.

So far this year, 2,636 cases have been reported to federal health officials, up from 1,993 reported the week before, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in its weekly update of outbreak data.

Blood-sucker: The number of U.S. cases of West Nile virus, which is spread by mosquitoes, has climbed by nearly a third in the last week

A total of 118 people have now died from the disease, compared with 87 reported one week ago.

The disease has been reported in people, birds or mosquitoes in 48 U.S. states, so far absent only in Alaska and Hawaii.

About 40 per cent of all human cases are in Texas, the CDC said. Two-thirds of the cases have cropped up in six states.

Officials are convinced 
that this will be the worst year for West Nile virus deaths and severe 
illnesses since the disease hit America's shores in 1999.

The worst year for the mosquito-borne
disease was 2002, which saw nearly 3,000 severe cases and 284 deaths.

West Nile virus is a disease spread by mosquitoes.

It was first diagnosed in Uganda in 1937,
but no cases were reported in the U.S. until 1999 in New York. The 
virus gradually spread across the country.

Only about one in five infected people report feeling unwell. Early symptoms can include fever, headache and body aches.

Some
recover in a matter of days. But one in 150 infected people will 
develop severe symptoms including neck stiffness, disorientation, coma 
and paralysis.

Of the cases reported to the CDC this year, 1,405, or 53 per cent, are of the severe neuroinvasive form of the disease, which can lead to meningitis and encephalitis.

The milder form of the disease causes flu-like symptoms and is rarely lethal.Â 

While the height of mosquito season has 
passed, infections are expected to continue into October, and severe 
illness and death reports are expected to keep coming in for months, CDC
officials said.

West Nile outbreaks tend to be unpredictable. Hot temperatures, rainfall amounts and ecological factors such as the bird and mosquito populations have to align just right to trigger an outbreak like the one this year.

It was first diagnosed in Uganda in 1937, but no cases were reported in the U.S. until 1999 in New York. The virus gradually spread across the country.

Only about one in five infected people report feeling unwell. Early symptoms can include fever, headache and body aches.
