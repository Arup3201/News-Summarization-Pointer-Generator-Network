The gamble of assigned dorm living is a time honored right of passage for incoming college freshman, but as several soon-to-be students at the University of Central Florida recently discovered there are some fates worse than a rude roommate.

The University of Central Florida accidentally assigned several of its news students to live in bathrooms and closets, according to the student news outlet Knight News.

Incoming freshman Brian Schickman said there were warning signs when his room designation went through weekly changes.

The University of Central Florida accidentally assigned several of its news students to live in bathrooms and closets in its new Neptune dorm

Each of the accidental assignments happened for students set to live in Neptune, the colleges new housing facility.

Speaking to the Huffington Post, UCF spokesperson Courtney Gilmartin said that only a 'handful' of the campus's 7,000 students received the faulty assignments.

She said the issue was the result of a 'a computer programming glitch that is now fixed.'

'Students
 were reassigned within Neptune and 
Housing conducted a thorough review of the software and housing 
assignments to be sure the other assignments were correct,' she explained, and that 'there 
wouldn’t have been a chance that students would show up on campus and 
not have a place to live" because 'the 
incorrect room assignments would have come up as move-in preparation 
drew closer.'

UCF officials said the issue has already been resolved and blamed the error on a computer glitch

She added that housing officials had already taken steps to fix the problem.

At Total Frat Move, Bogey Wells joked that the school should have to put itself on probation for hazing students. 

'If I can’t make freshmen live in 
bathrooms, neither can you!' he wrote.
