A learner driver attacked his examiner, accused him of being racist and even threatened to find out where he lived and kill him after being told he had failed his driving test.

Martin Olujosun, 22, initially claimed to have acted in self defense after lashing out at senior examiner Darral Gregory - splintering a bone in his shoulder and leaving him in immense pain and unable to work.

At Medway Magistrates' Court he pleaded guilty to threatening behaviour and common assault and was spared jail, instead receiving an 18-month suspended sentence.

Martin Olujosun, 22, took his driving test at the Gillingham Driving Test Centre, but when he had failed, he took it out on staff

The confrontation came about after examiners at the test centre in Gillingham, Kent told Olujosun he had failed his driving test.

When told his complaints would have to be put in writing Olusojun started swinging wildly in Mr Gregory's face.

As he tried to defend himself Mr Gregory grabbed Olujosun’s jumper and fell into some chairs.

Olujosun, of Woolwich, south east London, continued his attack and elbowed the examiner in the face before pushing him over again.

Other examiners tried to come to Mr Gregory’s aid as other learner drivers waiting to take their tests at the centre in Gillingham, Kent watched in horror.

The court heard some of them were so traumatised by the incident they were unable to take their test that day.

Another driving instructor eventually managed to pull Olujosun off Mr Gregory and push him out of the building before locking the door.

Olujosun continued to hurl abuse through the door, threatening to find out where Mr Gregory lived and kill him.

Mr Gregory was left in immense pain after the incident and found it impossible to do his job because of a shoulder injury.

An MRI scan revealed a bone splintered in his shoulder and he had to undergo an operation to remove it.

The injury meant he could not dress properly, wear a seatbelt without being in pain or take part in sport.

When arrested Olujosun claimed he acted in self-defence.

He has now pleaded guilty to threatening behaviour and common assault and been given an 18-month suspended sentence.

Medway Magistrates also ordered him to pay £1,500 compensation to Mr. Gregory plus £500 court costs and carry out 150 hours of unpaid work.

Patrick Bligh, defending, said: 'He regrets it. If you held a gun to his head he can’t tell you why, he just lost it, he’d just lost his mother.'

A Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency spokesman said: 'We take any cases of assaults very seriously and will take action against anyone who displays threatening behaviour.'
