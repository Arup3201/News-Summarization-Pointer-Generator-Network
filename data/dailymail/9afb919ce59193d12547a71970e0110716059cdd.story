Desperate for success: Policeman George McNaught falsely issued hundreds of fines to be successful at work

He made a name for himself after wrestling a gun from the hands of a woman who was pointing it at a young boy.

And after his spell in the limelight, it appears PCSO George McNaught was determined to keep up the crime-fighting.

But the 48-year-old’s desire for success ended in shame yesterday when the Blunkett Bobby was jailed for six months for issuing hundreds of false fixed penalty notices.

McNaught was the first PCSO in London to be awarded the commendation of the High Sheriff of London after wrestling a gun from a woman’s hands at Victoria Station in 2009.

He was given the award by then Met police commissioner Sir Paul Stephenson for pinning down the armed suspect after she pointed the weapon at a boy.

But the Westminster-based PCSO was so hungry for success he began inventing bogus penalty notices, usually for cycling on the pavement.

McNaught targeted members of  the public after finding their names and addresses on items of  lost property.

Some victims paid the fines – which started at £45 and quickly increased to £320 – while others spent hours arguing about them in court.

One woman who was issued a false notice had bailiffs come to her home chasing £320 in fines. Another ticket was issued to a man who had suffered nerve damage to his arm and could not even ride a bike.

Although the exact number of false notices issued is unknown, investigating detectives found at least 350 suspect tickets between February 2010 and September last year.

McNaught was caught out after a man fined for cycling on the pavement on the Strand complained.

When police searched the officer’s home they found a canister of CS gas which had been reported missing from a police locker room.

Humiliated victims: One woman was falsely fined £320 by Mr McNaught and was left embarrassed and humiliated

Fallon Alexis, prosecuting, said: ‘One woman was stopped at Victoria Coach station with friends and had bailiffs come to her house after she was ordered to pay £320 in fines.

‘She had to come to a subsequent court hearing, and in her own words felt embarrassed and humiliated, due to Mr McNaught.

‘Another man who paid a £45 fine later told police that he had an accident in 1997 and suffered nerve damage to his left arm and shoulder. He said he could not use a bicycle if he wanted to.’ 

McNaught, of Paddington, admitted one count of misconduct in a public office and possession of a prohibited weapon.

Judge John Hillen said: ‘It’s an abuse of power by someone who is given power and then decides to use that power in a bad way. As a PCSO he had a power and used it in a crazy way which is extremely harmful.

‘You have a positively good character, for some seven years as a PCSO in which I’m told you loved, and indeed did extremely well in.

‘You were serving the public but that trust placed in you, you abused.

Lost property: Mr McNaught targeted cyclists using personal details found on lost property

‘What motivated you is and remains entirely unclear. There was no financial gain, there was no corruption, there was no acting on behalf of criminals or friends.

‘It seems to me, what you chose to do having been given power, was to abuse that power.

‘The public have to be confident in the fixed penalty notice system and you undermined that confidence.

‘Confidence in the PCSO community has also been undermined.’

Ann-Marie Talbot, defending, said McNaught had been sacked as a PCSO and had moved back to his native Scotland, where he worked as a part-time cleaner.

She added: ‘It would appear there was no motivation other than a desire to be successful in his job.

‘I don’t think he understands himself though what led him to take these actions.’
