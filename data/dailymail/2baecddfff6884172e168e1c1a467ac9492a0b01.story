We’ve had phone cases that double up as tasers, Swiss Army knives and even edible cases made from rice - but the latest design is much more practical, and could save your life.

The Wello case, from Indian firm Azoi, has been fitted with monitoring sensors that measure a number of key health vitals.

It tracks blood pressure, electrocardiography (ECG), heart rate, blood oxygen, temperature and lung functions with what the company calls a ‘high level of accuracy’ - and the measurements can be shared.

‘Fast and easy-to-use, Wello empowers people to track key data, improve awareness of their body’s state and make more informed lifestyle choices,’ explained Azoi’s founder and CEO Hamish Patel. 

‘Over the last two years, we have focused our efforts on coming up with a technologically advanced tool to help people monitor their health.

Patel described Wello as ‘a not-so-small engineering feat in microelectronics, nanosensors, imaging, data analytics and design.’

Measurements are taken by holding two fingers and thumbs over the four sensors on the back and side of the case.

Blood
 Pressure: Wello gives a blood pressure reading, it also gives multiple readings so users can track any patterns that cause spikes or dips.

ECG: The case takes an ECG reading without wires. An ECG is a mapping of electrical signals from the heart.

Heart
 Rate: Wello keeps track of a user's heart rate or pulse. A pulse provides clues to the state of a person's fitness, potential heart 
problems or other illnesses.

Blood Oxygen: The case helps measure the amount of oxygen being used to pump blood around a body.

Temperature:
The sensors read a person's body temperature from their fingers. This is used to monitor a fever, for example.

Lung 
Function: Wello reads how much air a user inhales and exhales, which may point 
towards possible obstructions or underlying conditions.

These sensors measure all the vital health signs and record them on the Wello app. The results appear ‘within seconds.’

These measurements can be shared with family members and doctors, for example, or used to plot changes in health over time.

‘All too often, health problems go undetected until they are too late to address,’ continued Patel.

The case, pictured, will cost £120 in the UK and $199 in the U.S. European shipments will arrive in Summer, but U.S shipments will be delayed until Autumn pending FDA approval

‘We believe that through improved self-awareness of key vitals, technology could very easily reduce the incidence and impact of a wide range of illnesses and diseases. ‘

Wello also connects with other health and fitness devices, such as pedometers, to help identify how different behaviours affect a person’s health.

The data can additionally be accessed remotely on a web browser, meaning if a friend or relative is having a health problem, users can keep an eye on them from miles away.

Wello will cost £120 in the UK, €145 in Europe and $199 in the U.S.  

A Tricorder is a scanning device used by Starfleet personnel in the Star Trek universe. There are two variations; a regular (engineering) tricorder, pictured here being used by Spock, played by Leonard Nimoy, and a medical tricorder

It is expected to ship in Summer across Europe, Canada and Asia, but U.S shipments will be delayed until Autumn pending FDA approval.

The technology is similar to the tricorder scanning device used by Starfleet personnel in the Star Trek universe.

There are two variations; a regular (engineering) tricorder and a medical tricorder.

Another device, called the Scanadu Scout, pictured, works in a similar way to the Star Trek tricorder, and Azio's Wello case. It is held on a person's temple for 10 seconds. Built-in sensors then establish body temperature, heart rate, blood oxygen levels and more

Medical tricorders are used to scan a patient, either in a ‘sick bay’ on a star ship, or during an away mission.

The
 advanced scanning tool can determine a patient’s medical status and 
readings, and allows doctors to quickly and easily diagnose their 
condition without an intensive or invasion examination.
