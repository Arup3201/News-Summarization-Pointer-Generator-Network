The wife of a seriously-wounded Army Ranger who shocked onlookers by saluting during his Purple Heart ceremony in hospital has revealed her baby bump.

Josh Hargis, 24, and his wife Taylor, from Cincinnati, Ohio, have announced they are expecting their first baby in May - bringing joy for the couple after months of adversity.

Hargis suffered leg injuries after a female suicide bomber detonated her explosives in Afghanistan in October, killing four of Hargis' comrades, and costing the soldier both of his legs.

Hargis, who had been on his fourth tour 
of Afghanistan, battled a neck brace, breathing apparatus and tubes to 
complete the mark of respect when a senior officer presented him the 
medal.

The brave and magnanimous gesture brought tears to the eyes of the 50 grown men and soldiers who had gathered in the room to witness the ceremony.

An image of the touching moment became an internet hit.

It marked the start of the couple's uplifting journey - as Taylor stood beside her husband as he underwent grueling physical therapy and learned how to walk on prosthetic limbs.

Taylor has caught each moment on camera, and most recently shared a photograph of her growing bump to her Facebook page, adding: 'He is a kicking fool!'

And as the couple try to get back to normal, Taylor's brother is spear-heading a fundraising campaign to help them.

'Without question there is a lot 
going on in their lives and this is only the beginning of a series of 
adversities that they will have to overcome,' Patrick Griffith posted on a fundraising website.

He has organized the 'Warrior’s Walk', which is a 222-mile walk from Fort Stewart to Fort Benning, 
Georgia that began on Monday. It aims to raise funds and support for the Hargis family.

The group is completing 17 miles each day and Josh and Taylor Hargis will join
for the final four miles of the walk, relatives said.

Family and friends now hope to raise funds for the couple and their imminent arrival, knowing they still have tough times ahead.

'Though we can't change what has happened, we can change their future,' Griffith wrote.

Relatives added to ABCNews.com that Hargis has already received a hand-cycle and an all-terrain 
wheelchair from generous donors.

Hargis was stationed in Afghanistan as part of the 3rd Army 
Ranger Battalion on October  when a suicide bomber detonated her vest.

When soldiers surrounded his hospital bed to
 pin the Purple Heart to his blanket, they assumed he was unconscious, but Hargis made every effort to salute.

The simple gesture left a lasting poignant memory for the senior officer, who wanted to share the story of Josh's honor and bravery with the world.

A letter from his commander to Taylor explained the gravitas of the occasion.

'I cannot impart on you the level of emotion that poured through the intensive care unit that day,' he wrote in the letter, which she shared on Facebook.

'Grown men began to weep and we were speechless at a gesture that speak volumes about Josh's courage and character.'

The commander added that he 'will remember it as the single greatest event I have witnessed in my ten years in the Army'.
