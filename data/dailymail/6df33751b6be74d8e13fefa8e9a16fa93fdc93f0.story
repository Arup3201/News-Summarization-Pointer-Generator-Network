After Barcelona's 1-0 defeat by Malaga on Saturday, the Spanish press are predicting a gloomy week for the Catalan giants.

Juanmi scored as Luis Enrique's side failed to win for the first time in 12 matches, and the local media were damning in their judgement.

Mundo Deportivo insists it is the curse of the four o'clock kick-off for Barcelona, despite the fact that they beat Levante 5-0 last time they started a game at that time.

Mundo Deportivo says Manchester City will have a feast ahead of their clash with Barcelona

The paper goes on to say that Manchester City 'will have a feast' before their Champions League clash with Barcelona, such is their certainty to win.

As, meanwhile, continue on down the same route and point out that neither Lionel Messi nor Neymar managed a shot on target throughout the game. 

The newspaper also quotes Enrique as saying that his side deserved to lose. 

Marca opts to award some of the credit to Malaga, saying their 'perfect' defence won the match, while also lambasting Dani Alves for his mistake that led to the only goal of the game.

In Italy, AC Milan owner Silvio Berlusconi may finally be running out of patience with manager Pippo Inzaghi, according to La Gazzetta Sportiva.

Milan are currently 11th in Serie A, 27 points behind league leaders Juventus, and Inzaghi is reportedly ready to experiment with his side for the clash with Cesena.

A poll in the paper suggests that the former striker still has the good will of the supporters, but they would prefer to see national team manager and former Juventus boss Antonio Conte in charge.
