For most people, the thought of a bonus often goes hand in hand with dreams of acquiring the latest designer handbag or gadget.

But new research suggests that giving it all away could in fact give you the biggest buzz of all.

Scientists believe that individuals gain happiness and productivity at work as well as better team performance by sharing their bonus money.

A series of studies found providing employees with a bonus to spend on charities or their co-workers also led to uplifted team sales.

Researchers at Duke University believe individuals gain happiness and productivity at work as well as better team performance by sharing their work bonus

The research was conducted by Fuqua School of Business at Duke University and published in the PLOS ONE journal.

In three studies where some employees at an Australian bank were given a $25 or $50 voucher to donate to charity on behalf of their company, employees who donated the larger amount 
to charity reported enhanced happiness and job satisfaction, compared to
those who did not donate to charity or donated the smaller amount.

In subsequent experiments, the researchers measured the performance of 11 sports teams in Canada and 14 pharmaceutical sales teams in Belgium after receiving bonuses.

A third of each team was selected to receive $20 to spend either on themselves or on their teammates.

In both experiments, the researchers found that when participants spent their bonuses on teammates, the whole team performed significantly better than when individuals spent their bonuses on themselves.

The increase in team performance may also increase earnings as a whole, the study suggests.

In the case of pharmaceutical sales, for every $10 given to a team member to spend on their colleagues, the team received $52 in sales.

Lalin Anik from the university said: 'The results across three studies suggest that a minor adjustment to employee bonuses - shifting the focus from the self to others - can create more altruistic, satisfying, and productive workplace.'

Recent research by the university into the relationship between job satisfaction and money found most people would pick a boring job over a stimulating one if they do not think they are being paid enough for the extra efforts, even if they claim otherwise.

Marketing professor Peter Ubel explored the idea of 'effort aversion' or why people choose to put less effort into a task even if they do not again as much satisfaction from it.

Another study by Duke University found most people would pick a boring job over a stimulating one if they do not think they are being paid enough for their extra efforts

He said:'We found even when an effortful job would be more interesting and 
enjoyable than one requiring less effort, people might price themselves 
out of the job market because they feel their effort needs to be 
rewarded.'

Together with researchers from Stirling University, Professor Ubel conducted studies that showed how wages impact a job seeker's willingness to take on more challenges.

In the first experiment they asked 144 people which job they would choose from two on offer at a cultural festival. The usher role required considerably more effort than the monitor role.

While 82 per cent of people preferred the job description of the usher role, only 36 per cent would take the job if it payed more than the less demanding monitor position.

This story must have been written by a failed banker now working in a charity store.

What a load of rubbish. I can assure you that I am extremely happy when I get a bonus all for myself.

I derive satisfaction from depriving highly paid charity bosses of my hard earned money.

They must be joking. I can hardly feed myself, least pay my monthly bills. Give my bonus to Charity??? I don't think so - over my dead body!

Hmpf. $20. That's sure to be a perfect experiment. Make it $20,000 up for grabs and see what happens....

And for those asking the meaning of "bonus" its what my company do to myself and my colleagues every time they "review" our pay.....

mmm yes, that'll be right. Which donkey a) researches stupid things like this (paid for probably) and b) comes to these ridiculous conclusions. An absolute load of tosh.
