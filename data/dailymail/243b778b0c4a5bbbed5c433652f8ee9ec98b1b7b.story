An Arkansas woman who survived a dangerous accident was filmed last week surrounded by medical staff as they helped her walk again.

Natalie Jo Eaton, 18, was seen inside an Atlanta facility in the footage broadcast by WMC.

In an August accident, Eaton was impaled by a golf club, the affiliate station reported.

On her feet: Arkansas State University student Natalie Jo Eaton is seen walking again after surviving the accident

Bizarre: A campus police incident report said a 20-year-old man at the event struck a flying football with the golf club - which fell apart and impaled Eaton

A student at Arkansas State University, Eaton was impaled while at a rush event, WMC reported, and was seen last month using a wheelchair.

A campus police incident report, excerpts of which were published by KAIT, said a 20-year-old man at the event struck a flying football with the golf club.

The report went on to say that 'The separated shaft and head traveled around 30 feet when the shaft impaled [Eaton].'

'When it the club went in, it hit her spinal cord,' friend Makaleigh Riddle told KAIT in August. 'The way doctors talked about it, it was probably paralysis. That's the best that we were looking at. It was really hard to hear. But now she's moving her arms and legs a day later. I don't know. That's just crazy. I know people are praying everywhere but that's a miracle. She's the strongest person I've ever met so that doesn't surprise me at all.'

Help: The man who used the golf club reportedly helped Eaton after she was impaled

Speaking about the 20-year-old man, Riddle said at the time 'She just went to fall and he held her head there for a good 15 minutes to keep her in place. If that [the club] had moved at all, there was not really anything anyone could have done. 

'His quick reaction probably saved her life. He had to be really strong for that. I couldn't imagine.'

'It was a freak accident which is basically the only way to describe it,' Riddle also told KAIT. 'There's no way you could have even imagined that that's what would have happened. I feel terrible for him and his family. That's going to be really hard to deal with.'

Eaton is receiving treatment from the Shepherd's Center, WMC reported.
