The most dangerous criminals will be tracked via satellites orbiting the earth. The system is already being used to monitor immigration cases such as Abu Qatada

New GPS tags set to be introduced in April will mean paedophiles can be banned from areas where children gather.

The system, which monitors the most dangerous criminals via satellites orbiting the earth, will set off an alarm if the sex offenders go too near a school.

Satellite tagging, which has already been tested on a number of high profile criminals, and immigrations cases including Muslim hate preacher Abu Qatada, will allow officials to track offenders around the clock for the first time.

Probation chiefs say it will be used on the most high-risk offenders freed early from jail or given a community sentence, and has already been trialled on high-risk offenders in Hertfordshire and Wales.

Officials will be able to track offenders by following dots across a map on their computer screens.

It will detail exactly where they have been, how fast they are travelling, and whether they are in a vehicle or on foot.

Authorities will also be able to set 'exclusion zones' for each offender.

It means paedophiles could be barred from school areas, with the tag alerting officials by setting off an alarm if they go too close.

Justice Secretary Chris Grayling said: 'Satellite tagging will allow us to keep a much closer watch on high risk and persistent offenders, who cause so much harm.

'Monitoring the movements of dangerous and repeat offenders will be vital in cutting crime, creating a safer society with fewer victims and ultimately offering greater protection and reassurance to the public.'

Britain's current tags, introduced in 1999, are used to ensure offenders obey a night-time curfew. But they cannot track a person's daytime movements.

Cost issues and technical difficulties saw a similar idea abandoned in 2007, as it was found that criminals could block the GPS signal by standing near tall buildings or even trees.

The technology was also trialed by the NHS on medium and high-risk patients during a pilot scheme in 2010.

It is hoped extending the scheme to criminals would help ease the pressure on Britain's overflowing prisons.

There are around 22,500 offenders electronically monitored at any one time.

During the financial year 2010/11, 116,000 subjects were tagged - nine per cent more than the previous financial year.

A Ministry of Justice spokesman said the cost of the contract was still being negotiated but last year electronic monitoring cost £117m.

He added: 'This is one of the largest electronic monitoring schemes in the world, and is regarded as delivering a successful and high quality service. 

'New contracts for electronic monitoring services  due to be awarded in spring 2013 will allow us to improve delivery and introduce the most sophisticated and advanced technology in the world.

'They will also represent better value for taxpayers. Properly administered, new generation tagging can promote improved behaviour and give victims greater reassurance.

'The new contracts will be awarded in spring 2013 and this will be followed by a mobilisation period in which the GPS tags will be introduced.'
