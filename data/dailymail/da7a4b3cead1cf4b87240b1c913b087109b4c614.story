 A Melbourne ice lord who mistakenly thought his "cook" was stealing from him has been jailed for callously kidnapping and killing the man to protect his drug operation.

Brok Seckold, 31, carefully planned how he would murder and dismember 23-year-old Yengo Faugere after police raided a Canterbury laboratory where Faugere produced methylamphetamine for him.

Victorian Supreme Court Justice Lex Lasry said Seckold was obsessed with succeeding in his drug business, and killed Mr Faugere because he thought he had taken drugs to sell on the side.

Seckold believed Mr Faugere had betrayed him because media coverage of the 2011 Canterbury raid did not show any methylamphetamine in the lab and he believed Mr Faugere was siphoning-off precursor chemicals.

Seckold kidnapped Mr Faugere in October 2011, drove him 200km out of Melbourne, shot him and dismembered the body.

Justice Lasry on Friday jailed Seckold for 32 years.

He said Seckold did not once stop to hesitate about doing such a terrible thing to another human being.

"All you could contemplate was either punishment of Faugere or protection of your drug business," Justice Lasry said.

"The community must be genuinely affronted that people like you can kill for such thoroughly despicable reasons."

Seckold denied killing Mr Faugere but pleaded guilty to drug trafficking and weapons charges.

Justice Lasry said apart from Seckold's desire to make money by selling drugs, there was little that explained how he could plan and commit such a callous killing.

"More serious cases of murder are few and far between," he said.

Seckold, of Maribyrnong, must serve 25 years before being eligible for parole.

Speaking outside the court, Mr Faugere's mother Florence Pinto said she was happy the long process had come to an end.

"That brings some closure to us, his family, and his younger brothers," Ms Pinto told reporters.
