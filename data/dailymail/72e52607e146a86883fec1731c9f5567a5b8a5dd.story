Suspect: Laurence Alan Stewart

The 25-year-old law school dropout who allegedly set off pipe bombs in his ex-girlfriend’s house has been arrested after leading authorities on an intense car chase through Montana.

According to the Associated Press, authorities took into custody Laurence Alan Stewart II on Thursday after he led them on a 40-mile chase, throwing multiple homemade explosives at his pursuers.

Several of the bombs detonated, but no one was seriously injured.

Stewart had already been wanted in Virginia for allegedly planting other homemade explosives in the homes of his ex-girlfriend and two police officers earlier this week.

The explosion caused serious damage to the woman’s home, blowing a hole through the roof and several rooms, but she was not injured.

The two police officers were also unharmed. It was unclear how Stewart ended up in Montana.

Virginia State Police had issued a 'Blue Alert' on Stewart Wednesday, which meant that he intended to harm police officers.

This was the first such alert issued in Virginia state history.

'This was an individual that was very dangerous,' said Bradley Beyersdorf, a spokesman for the Federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. 'He showed that capacity in Virginia and continued that today in Montana.'

After three days on the lam, police only managed to catch up with Stewart after he was pulled over by Montana Highway Patrol for speeding.

Stewart initially slowed down but then speeded off, starting the chase along Highway 87.

The police managed to disable 
Stewart’s car and tracked him down on foot. He was arrested with a 
handgun and authorities said there may be more explosives in the car.

Stewart faces three counts of 
attempted deliberate homicide for allegedly throwing pipe bombs near 
patrol cars and one count of felony criminal endangerment for a pipe 
bomb thrown near a civilian's car.

He also faces charges of attempted 
capital murder of a law enforcement officer, manufacture or possession 
of a weapon of terror, and arson in Virginia.
