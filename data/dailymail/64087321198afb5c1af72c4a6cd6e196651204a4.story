The first day of The View's earthshaking new host lineup saw the triumphant return of cantankerous former emcee Rosie O'Donnell after an eight-year absence, along with two completely new co-hosts who will no-doubt make this relaunch one of the most memorable yet.

Appearing for the first time on the panel was token blonde Nicolle Wallace, who conservative credentials beat even Bush-loving Elisabeth Hasselbeck since Wallace actually worked for George W.

And in the third corner, the wildcard: known for her voice as much as for her no-holds-barred New York City attitude--actress Rosie Perez.

Shoeless: Rosie was sure to get a pedicure over fears her unkempt feet might draw attention from the new improved show as she recovered from some sciatica. The first day of The View's earthshaking new host lineup saw the triumphant return of the cantankerous former emcee after an eight-year absence, along with two completely new co-hosts who will no-doubt make this relaunch one of the most memorable yet

Two Rosies! Rosie O'Donnell is back after a contentious exit and several years absence and she's brought another Rosie with her--actress and activist Rosie Perez

Barbara gave her blessing: The queen herself made an appearance in a pre-taped segment as the ladies of her show held court and each kissed her hand

But don't expect too many screaming matches or claims that the world is flat (here's looking at you Sherri Shepherd): O'Donnell says the new View will be smarter, calmer and an all-around better show.

The live show began calmly, with introductions and a nod to creator and news media queen Barbara Walters, who held court from a throne and had her hand kissed by each of the hostesses, including the only one remaining from the previous season, Whoopi Goldberg.

'Welcome to the newer view,' joked Whoopi, before introducing Rosie O'Donnell.

O'Donnell kicked things off by catching up with viewers, including a discussion of her heartache and the gastric bypass surgery that followed.

Up next, an introduction of the other Rosie--actress Rosie Perez, who plugged her upcoming Broadway show and memoir.

Then came Nicolle Wallace: former George W. Bush press secretary for six years.

'I am a Republican, I should get that out of the way,' she said through a smile to audience uproar on both sides of the aisle.

Before things got too out of control, fiery liberal Rosie O'Donnell piped in: 'And I like her, I swear!'

True to form, though, the group jumped right into a contentious topic--the Ray Rice domestic abuse saga and further questions over child and sex abuse.

'All about money, all about the brand being jeopardized,' politico Wallace chimed in first on the Rice issue.

Perez agreed there's no excuse for hitting women, used her sports hero, convicted abuser Floyd Mayweather, to make the point that one's environment could be at fault as much as the individual.'[You] Respond the way you were taught,' said the actress.

But should one continue to support the likes of Mayweather and Rice by paying for event tickets? O'Donnell didn't think so.

'I haven't seen a Woody Allen movie since the allegations came out,' O'Donnell said, moving the conversation along to her own struggles with abuse. Though she did say she continues to appreciate Chris Brown as an artist, despite his violent past.

Values clash? Whoopi is back, of course, but a woman with decidedly different politics from hers is on this year, too. Not just a mom-first, mouthy conservative like former host Elisabeth Hasselbeck, new token blonde conservative Nicolle Wallace actually worked George W's White House

Pulling her weight: All the ladies on the panel were fascinated as former Bush staffer turned Sarah Palin wrangler recalled her days in the controversial White House and ill-fated McCain campaign trail

Perez and O'Donnell introduced a new audience participation game they will play each day together, a play on their identical names called Ro or Ro?

In the game, the audience members tries to win a prize by deciding which Rosie does the thing being described on a card.

In one of the inaugural game's questions, O'Donnell asked which of the Rosies practices tae kwon do.

'O'Donnell!' replied the contestant.

'Wrong,' O'Donnell belowed to the young lady's chagrin. 

With two comedians and a funny lady actress on the panel, the group also addressed the recent tragic deaths of Robin Williams and Joan Rivers.

'I've been at that place,' O'Donnell said, empathizing with her depression-plagued late friend Robin Williams. O'Donnell suggested that, for the depressed, leaving grieving children behind isn't enough to stop someone bent on suicide. 

Ask Me Anything: A new segment gave the ladies and their viewers some time to catch up and get to know the panel--for instance: Wallace hates Hillary, Rosie O'Donnell has a gastric bypass, Perez has a forthcoming memoir, and Whoopi, well, she's been enjoying her shoes

Another new segment came in the form of an audience participation game called Ro or Ro? where contestants must decide which Rosie is being described on a card

Loss but a win: While this episode's contestant lost Ro or Ro? with only one correct answer, the game did reveal a little known and astonishing fact about Perez--she practices tae kwon do!

When the topic had turned to politics, all eyes turned to Wallace.

'Hillary Clinton and I were not good friends,' she said as the group touched on the Clintons' recent trip to Iowa.

She's definitely running 100 percent, though, said the Washington insider.

While Hillary is today's hot topic, the group was more interested by far to hear Wallace's stories about her days as Sarah Palin's wrangler during the the McCain campaign.

Wallace kept her cool but did reveal that Palin blamed her completely for the VP candidate's infamous interview with Katie Couric and said the candidate and aide's relationship was irreparably damaged that day in 2008. 

She also gave a comic rendition of the day she learned Vice President Cheney had shot a man during Bush II's already unpopular second term that left the ladies in stitches. 

The show concluded with a tribute to Rivers that began with a song in the comedienne's honor by Broadway diva Kristin Chenoweth.

A best-of montage of some of Rivers' over 30 appearances then followed, to much applause and teary eyes.

'She gave and gave and gave,' Perez said as O'Donnell joked about the snarky comments Rivers made to her regarding her unconventionally feminine persona. 'Loved it,' she said. 

Big fans of Joan: The show concluded with a tearful tribute to a dear friend of the View, the recently passed Joan Rivers, who appeared on the show over 30 times

Tribute: Guest Kristin Chenoweth gave a beautiful tribute to Joan Rivers through song to help close out the show
