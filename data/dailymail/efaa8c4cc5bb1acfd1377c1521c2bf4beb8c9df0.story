Queens Park Rangers manager Chris Ramsey feels Charlie Austin is more deserving of a place in Roy Hodgson's England squad than Tottenham's Harry Kane.

Austin has missed out on Hodgson's latest England squad for the upcoming Euro 2016 qualifier against Lithuania and friendly with Italy, despite accumulating 15 Premier League goals this season – just one fewer than Kane, who is set to earn his first senior cap.

The former Burnley man's goal haul puts him above the other three strikers in Hodgson's squad – Wayne Rooney (11), Danny Welbeck (4) and Daniel Sturridge (3) – and Ramsey thinks Austin's ability to score goals in a relegation-threatened side makes him more deserving of an England call-up.

'Charlie has been fantastic this season his work-rate has been unbelievable and he has the uncoachable thing of being able to score goals' Ramsey said ahead of Hodgson's announcement.

'I am sure he will be in the reckoning for the squad.'

When asked if Austin deserved his chance as much as Kane, the QPR boss added: 'Even more so because he is doing it in a team that is struggling at the foot of the table and he has still scored quite a few goals this season.

The QPR boss said he felt Austin's work for a team struggling in the Premier League deserved more credit

'It goes to show that he is a quality player and he will shine regardless of where he plays.'

QPR face Everton on Sunday, with the Toffees now the only English side left in Europe following Manchester City's exit at the hands of Barcelona on Wednesday evening.

City followed Arsenal and Chelsea out of the Champions League at the last 16 stage, but Ramsey believes the Premier League's shortcomings in the competition is merely a 'blip'.

'Manchester City did not have their best game,' Ramsey said. 'But they all have gone out of the Champions League at a late stage.

'Not making it to the last eight is a blip for this country because over the past few years we have got to the latter stages, but now and again this happens.

'I still think this is the best league in the world and where everyone wants to really come and play. We can see that by the amount of overseas players and managers that we have in this league.'
