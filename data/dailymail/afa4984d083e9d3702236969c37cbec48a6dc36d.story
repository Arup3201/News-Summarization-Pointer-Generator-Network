A Russian businessman’s teenage daughter was found dead at a private international school in London in an apparent suicide.

Polina Artamonova, 17, was discovered in her room at Bellerbys College in Greenwhich, according to reports.

The teenager, from Ufa, Russia, originally, is said to have consumed alcohol in the hours leading up to her death.

Police were called to the scene on the morning of January 21 and the death is not being treated as suspicious.

According to the Evening Standard, paramedics tried to save her after rushing to her third floor flat - but she was pronounced dead at the scene.

The paper reported that friends said she was heartbroken about a secret relationship with a man and was having ‘difficulties’.

Her
 parents visited the school last month.

And Igor Artamonov today said he 
wanted to uncover the truth behind his daughter’s death and that he had 
‘hired people to gather information’.

A Russian friend told the paper: ‘Polina was the sort of person who kept a lot of feelings and emotions inside.

‘She loved a man - there were difficulties with this.

‘I think her family simply didn’t know. Not because the family didn’t try to know, I think it was that Polina tried to hide it not to upset them.’

The Metropolitan Police said they were called at 8.12am on January 21 following reports of a female suffering from a cardiac arrest in Stowage.
