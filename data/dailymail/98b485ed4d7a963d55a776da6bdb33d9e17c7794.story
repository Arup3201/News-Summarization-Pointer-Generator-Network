Metallic temporary tattoos have been summer's biggest new beauty hit.

From clubbers hitting the coolest bars in Ibiza to teen festival-goers at Glastonbury. Even Beyonce chose to sport the fade-away accessories while posing on her European superyacht.

And according to Paris Fashion Week, the temporary trend is here to stay.

Models at the Dries Van Noten SS15 show were painted with gold lip rings in Paris

The minimal, metallic make-up was inspired by the famous Burning Man festival

Finally, a catwalk trend we can all afford!

On Wednesday, models at Dries Van Noten SS15 in the Grand Palais sported painted-on gold lip rings with the same metallic foil effect as the other popular tattoo jewellery seen this summer.

Makeup artist Peter Philips told Vogue.com the gold line down each model's lower lip 'could be a piercing… it could even look like the shine from a lip gloss.' 

He used an eyeshadow brush to draw a line with MAC Mixing Medium and Ben Nye Gold Powder, and retraced the line with Make Up For Ever's Aqua Liner (in #1). 

He continued: 'Dries was thinking of the kind of girl who goes to Burning Man. She's not a hippie, but she loves nature - and she's also a bit high-tech.'

At Anthony Vaccarello, the vibe was more techno/rock, leading the trend away from the hippie look the jewellery has previously been associated with.

Models' earlobes were painted in a lacquered patent black, adding a gothic edge to the Spring/Summer 2015 ready-to-wear presentation on Tuesday.

The show's make-up artist Tom Pecheux said Anthony 'came up with the idea to create a piece of jewellery using makeup.

'I thought, perhaps we don’t do an earring, but a black tattoo - something that felt very graphic, because the collection is graphic,' the artist told Allure.

He drew rigid shapes on each ear lobe with a felt-tip eyeliner pen, before using Homeoplasmine to apply iridescent black glitter.

Fashion fans wanting to get this look now should invest in a Sharpie, or one of the packs of Temporary tattoos from Divine Ink London, Seekers of Sun, Flash Tattoos or Rosie Wonders.

These stencils mimic jewellery and take just 10 minutes to set after being applied with water. They then wear off gradually after a few days.

Dior designed a £100 limited-edition set of temporary tattoo cuffs, earrings, chokers and bracelets made of 24-carat gold in 2012.

A set from our favourite high street brand Divine Ink London comes in a little cheaper at £15 per pack. 

The tattoo-as-jewellery trend really took off at the beginning of summer. Alessandra Ambrosio and Aerin Lauder were the first celebrities to be spotted in them, and this month Beyonce, 33, showed off an impressive collection of temporary gold and silver body art while on a yacht around Europe.

The star has sported various iterations of the tattoos while on holiday including belly chains, necklaces, bracelets; and even obscure designs such as peacock feathers on her hip and stencils on her shoulders and shins.

Fashion blogger Mademoiselle Robot is a fan, she says: 'I first found out about the trend for metallic tattoos through Instagram (which is possibly where all things pretty can be discovered). 

'A friend of mine who is a make-up artist in Los Angeles had used them on a shoot. After a quick investigation (read: increasingly harrassing comments to my friend), I was in possession of my very own metallic tattoos. 

'I love them because they are the perfect complement to tanned skin - long live this Indian Summer - and they are also the lazy girl's best companion when it comes to accessorising. How could you say no to a built-in gaggle of bangles? 

'You can be as conservative or as creative as you want with the placement of your tattoos as well. I wear mine instead of jewellery, but I have seen some girls proudly sporting theirs in lieu of make-up at festivals and other dance parties in abandoned buildings...' 

Fashion blogger Mademoiselle Robot was inspired by a make-up artist friend in LA 

Celebrity make-up artist Nikki Wolff says: 'This new trend is fun and original and can definitely be translated onto the high street.

'Although I wouldn't necessarily recommend colouring in your earlobes with eyeliner to go into the office, replacing your usual eyeliner with a metallic one, or pressing a little fine gold glitter into the centre of your lips over a gloss or balm is a quick, simple way to wear this trend with minimal effort. 

Celebrity make-up artist Nikki Wolff recommends using Mac Reflects glitter to recreate a wearable effect

'Mac's Reflects Gold Glitter (£17) is perfect for this look. 

'Keep it under done and not too perfect... if your gold eyeliner smudges, or glitter falls onto your cheekbones, all the better!'

Recreate Beyonce's glittering body art on a budget with a pack of £15 Divine Ink London temporary tattoos (www.DivineInkLondon.com). The range is inspired by Egyptian symbols, with two sheets in each pack including chain, pendant and hieroglyphic designs.
