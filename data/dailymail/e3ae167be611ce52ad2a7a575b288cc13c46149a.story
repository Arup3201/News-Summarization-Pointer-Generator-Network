Aaron Lennon has been in the headlines following his deadline-day move to Everton for failing to smile while posing with his new side's shirt. 

Toffees boss Roberto Martinez has blamed the photographer for failing to ensure Lennon looked happy to have sealed a move to Goodison Park. 

Here, Sportsmail photographer Kevin Quigley gives us his view.

'I blame the photographer… It's his job to make him smile. I'll chase the photographer,' joked Everton manager Roberto Martinez on Aaron Lennon’s unveiling pictures.

Fair enough, photography is an art. Everyone has their own eye and perception is each to their own. That said, I know Peter Byrne and I am sure if you asked him if he was pleased with that set of pictures he wouldn’t say, ‘Yes, that is the best work I have ever done!’

Having said that, he has not messed a job up, he has not over or under exposed his work (sorry, photography talk for making them too light or too dark), he has not created a blurry image.

Sportsmail's Kevin Quigley says the photographer is not to blame for Lennon looking grumpy

He has simply failed to capture what every fan wants to see from their new signing which is for them to be happy to play for you, which should be the brief.

How this could have come about I can’t answer. I have had many footballers that have said, 'No, I am not doing that', or 'Does this make me look stupid?'

Most recently, for a group of rugby players, I wanted to re-create the famous picture from Manchester United’s ‘Class of 92’ to which I got: ‘Do you think we are a boy band?’

Fortunately enough, this created a laugh amongst the lads which saved me from the awkward situation that Peter has been dealt with in this job, someone that does not want their picture taken and therefore does not smile.

It is the job to make someone smile, but unlike other Barclays Premier League clubs such as Manchester United, Manchester City, Chelsea and Arsenal to name a few, Everton do not have a club photographer that deals with this stuff. 

They sub contract their stuff out via the Press Association which has many staff photographers, meaning anyone could turn up on the day.

Clubs with staff photographers who deal with the players and staff every day build up a rapport and trust with the individuals and can therefore do more exciting pictures. That’s difficult anyway when you just need to show them in a kit or holding a scarf.

Peter no doubt got a call that the Everton media team wanted him there as soon as possible. Upon arrival, I am guessing Peter would have been given the warm welcome of 'you haven't got long with him'. That’s what I get nearly every time I turn up to a club to do a feature with a player.

In that time he would have been given a player that is either in a rush before training or has just finished and has loads of other media activity to do, and maybe told ‘Can you quickly go and do some pictures', in a tone of voice meaning ‘This doesn’t really matter…’

Very few people like their pictures taken, I’m guessing Lennon is the same. No doubt a club official was present for this shoot, so why did they not ensure that their new player was smiling?

The 27-year-old, pictured with Teemu Tanio, Paul Stalteri, Martin Jol, Tom Huddlestone and Wayne Routledge, did not look too pleased when he joined Tottenham in 2005

I did some digging after I saw these pictures and spoke to a friend of Lennon's to ask if was unhappy about the move. His friend laughed when I sent them the pics and said 'Azza just chills, he looks happy but the pics are killing him, he’s just chilled - he is buzzing about the move'.

So if this is the case and he was, why does he look so sad? Well, I googled 'Aaron Lennon pictures', in three different Tottenham photo calls he has the same expression... he certainly did not hate Tottenham or was unhappy to be there. Also, lifting an award at Leeds he doesn’t exactly smile either - he has some previous when it comes to 'the smile.'
