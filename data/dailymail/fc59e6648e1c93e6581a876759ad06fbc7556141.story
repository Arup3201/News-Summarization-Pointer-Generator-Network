Investigation: This group of four CCTV grabs was issued by British Transport Police of a man they would like to trace, pushing a suitcase trolley onto the tracks at Euston station in Central London

Inspector James Tyrrell, of BTP, said: ‘The man was walking along platform one at Euston station with a suitcase at about 9pm on August 6.

‘As shown in the footage, he approached a suitcase trolley, which was on the platform, and suddenly pushed it onto the tracks, before walking off from the scene. 

‘A short time later, a train arriving into the station struck the trolley, luckily causing no significant damage.’

Mr Tyrrell added: ‘We are unsure as to why the man deliberately pushed the trolley onto the tracks before walking away, which is why we are keen to trace him and speak to him about his dangerous actions.
