Luke Shaw admits it will be a dream come true to step out at Old Trafford as a Manchester United player for the first time when Louis van Gaal’s side face Valencia in their final pre-season friendly on Tuesday.

The occasion also marks Van Gaal’s first home game in charge before United host Swansea in their Premier League opener next weekend, and Shaw is under no illusion that the deposed champions need to put a disastrous season behind them and get back to winning trophies under the Dutchman.

The England defender, signed from Southampton for £27million this summer, said: ‘As a kid, it’s a dream to play at Old Trafford. It’s one of the biggest arenas in the world, you would say.

Luke who's talking: Luke Shaw admits it will be a dream come to true to make his Old Trafford debut

Dutch of class: Every game is serious for new manager Louis van Gaal (L), reveals Luke Shaw

‘To know it’s going to be my home ground is something special. I can’t wait to get my first touch on the pitch just to relish it.

‘You have got to be positive and, for me personally, I have come here to win trophies and it is something everyone wants, not just me. Everyone in that dressing-room is looking to do it.

‘We want to win the Premier League. Obviously there is no Champions League for us this season so the main focus is on the Premier League and we all cannot wait to get started.’

Van Gaal is taking the game so seriously that he sent coach Marcel Bout on a 7,500-mile round trip from United’s training base in America to watch Valencia play Monaco in the Emirates Cup at Arsenal last weekend.

Shaw believes that is typical of the manager’s determination to hit the ground running this season after implementing a new 3-4-1-2 formation that sees the 19-year-old operating as a left wing-back.

‘Every game is serious,’ added Shaw. ‘We want to improve as a team and the way we can do that is going into the game properly by using the scouts to discover what they are like and see how we are going to play against them. I think it will help us.

‘The main thing is obviously the first Premier League game against Swansea for the first match of the season, but we want to keep improving as a team and getting used to the formation so we will be flying when the season starts.

‘It has been a crazy few weeks for me. I got back from the World Cup and came up here to get everything sorted with the medical. Then I had a couple of weeks off and it has been crazy but I’m glad I am back now and getting fit for the season.

‘I managed to get away and see what it is like on tour. I’d heard a lot of things about how crazy it was and I witnessed that. It was great to win the tournament (International Champions Cup) at the end as well.

‘Until you have gone out there, you don’t know what it's like. That surprised me but I have heard it (the fanaticism) is even worse in Asia so I was quite glad we were in America. It was really nice to see how many supporters United have got out there.’

New signing Ander Herrera (C) was overwhelmed by Manchester United's support in the States

United’s other summer signing, Ander Herrera, was also surprised to see how popular the club are Stateside following his £29m move from Athletic Bilbao.

‘My first surprise was we went to the stadium in LA and there were 80,000 people there singing Glory, Glory Man United, I really enjoyed seeing that,’ said Herrera.

‘It was a big experience for me and I now understand just how big Manchester United is in America. There were a lot of fans in the hotels, at training and in the stadiums and I really enjoyed the experience. I am also learning a lot from my team-mates and the staff, and I am looking forward to playing more games.’

Herrera’s Spanish compatriots David De Gea and Juan Mata – who will be facing his old club on Tuesday – have been helping the midfielder settle in at United.

‘I have played with Juan since we played for the Spain Under-21 team,’ he added. ‘We have a great relationship and with David too.

‘For me, he will become the best keeper in the world. He always trains hard and wants to improve. That’s very important for a keeper.’
