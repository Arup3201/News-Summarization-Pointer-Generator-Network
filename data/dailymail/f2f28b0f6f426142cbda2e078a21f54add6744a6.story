Sylvia Majewska was charged with two murder counts after the killings at her home in Oxford, Michigan

A Michigan judge has ruled that a 65-year-old mother accused of slashing the throat of her mentally-disabled son and beating her infant granddaughter to death is unfit for trial.

Sylvia Majewska was charged with two counts of first-degree murder after the killings of Daryne Gailey, 29, and seven-month-old Charley Hendrick at her home in Oxford on November 23 last year.

A District Court judge put proceedings on hold earlier today after a psychiatrist said during a competency hearing that Majewska is unfit to stand trial.

During the course of their investigation, Oakland County authorities found evidence indicating the deaths were planned.

County sheriff Michael Bouchard previously indicated Majewska 'came to the conclusion that the son and the child would be better off if they weren't alive'. 

She had previously sought a protective order against her son's ex-wife Amanda Hendrick. 

Gailey had learning disabilities and suffered seizures.

Majewska will undergo a second forensic exam before another competency hearing in May.

Authorities believe Majewska attempted to kill herself after the alleged murders.

She was found at the scene of the killings with blood dripping from her arm into a bucket, the Oakland Press reported. 

Majewska's defense attorney Bill Mitchell said he was not surprised by the ruling, WXYZ reported. 

He said: 'I am asking people to reserve judgment.

'That, obviously, something is very wrong with this lady. 

'Grandmothers and mothers don't behave as she is alleged to behave.'

During a previous court appearance in December, Majewska appeared to be disoriented and said she was feeling 'really dizzy'.

At the time, Mitchell said: 'She has difficulty understanding some things and communicating some things.

'She has obviously ― in my opinion, at least ― suffered from stress.' 

If convicted, Majewska faces a mandatory sentence of life in prison with no possibility of parole.
