A JetBlue pilot who caused panic after leaving the cockpit of his plane screaming about religion and terrorists was on Tuesday found insane and not guilty of interfering with a flight.

Clayton Osbon's bizarre behavior forced an emergency landing in March and he was charged with interference with a flight crew, facing a possible 20 years in prison.

A psychological examination that concluded, 'at the time of the commission of the offense, the defendant appeared to suffer from a severe mental disease or defect that impaired his ability to appreciate the nature, quality, or wrongfulness of his behavior.'

Fit for trial? JetBlue captain Clayton Frederick Osbon is pictured as he is escorted to a waiting vehicle by FBI agents after being released from The Pavilion at Northwest Texas Hospital in Amarillo in April

All parties, including the prosecutors, agreed to the report, seen by U.S. District Judge Mary Lou Robinson in Amarillo, Texas.

Last month, Judge Robinson declared 
Osbon fit to stand trial, saying he was 'not now suffering from a mental
disease or defect' that would make it impossible for him to assist in 
his own defense.

Osbon had been examined by a 
government-appointed psychologist who did not address whether he was 
sane at the time of the March 27 incident.

Judge Robinson ordered that Osbon be 
taken to a prison in Fort Worth, Texas, for a mental examination, then 
returned to court for an August 6 hearing, where his fate will be up to 
the judge.

Under federal law, people found not 
guilty by reason of insanity can be incarcerated until they can 
establish that they are entitled to be released.

Several passengers on board the 
flight have filed suit against JetBlue for gross negligence, saying the 
airline should have known that he was unfit for duty as a pilot.

Passengers aboard flight 191 watched 
in horror as  the 49-year-old ran through the aisle screaming 'say 
your prayers' and banged on the cockpit door after being locked out by 
his co-pilot Jason Dowd.

He had tried to interfere with the plane's 
controls and began rambling, saying, 'We're not going to Vegas,' and 
warning the first officer that 'We're going to have to take a leap of 
faith.'

They said Osbon had to be wrestled to
the floor of the plane that was heading from New York to Las Vegas 
after he began sprinting down the aisle, yelling that 'Things don't 
matter,' and talking about Afghanistan, Iraq and al-Qaeda.

He was restrained with seat belt extenders and zip tie handcuffs while the
first officer diverted the flight to land in Amarillo.

The veteran pilot started flying as a 
teenager with his father Ronald who was killed after crashing his small 
plane while enroute to look for treasure in Fort Lauderdale, according 
to a 1995 story in the Washington Island Observer.

Osbon has been married to his wife Connye since 2005, according to the pilot's Facebook page.

But witness accounts tell of a 
disturbed man, who about three hours into the flight, began behaving 
erratically, randomly talking with passengers on his way back to the 
cockpit before discovering he had been locked out after Dowd changed the
security code behind him.

When he went back to the cockpit and realized 
he had been locked out, a passenger told ABC News Osbon began screaming 'let 
me in'.

Mark Sellouk told CBS: 'He's banging 
on the door, yelling at the first officer, I think his name is Steve, 
'Bring the throttle to idle! Bring it to idle! Bring it to idle! We're 
going down, we're all going to die! Pray to Jesus. Open this goddamn 
door!'

Tony Antolino, a 40-year-old 
executive for a security firm, said the captain seemed disoriented and 
agitated, then began yelling about an unspecified threat linked to Iran,
Iraq and Afghanistan.

'They're
going to take us down, they're taking us down, they're going to take us
down. Say the Lord's prayer, say the Lord's prayer,' the captain 
screamed, according to Antolino.

In custody: The unidentified captain is removed in restraints from the flight to a waiting ambulance

Outburst: Passengers said the pilot lost it after he went back to the cockpit and realized he had been locked out by his co-pilot

Antolino, who said he sat in the 10th 
row, said he and three others tackled the captain as he ran for the 
cockpit door.

The passengers pinned the captain and held him down while the plane landed at 
Rick Husband Amarillo International Airport.

The flight had been packed with heavily built men 
heading to the 2012 International Security Conference in Las Vegas held for professionals working in ‘law enforcement, border
protection and campus security’.
