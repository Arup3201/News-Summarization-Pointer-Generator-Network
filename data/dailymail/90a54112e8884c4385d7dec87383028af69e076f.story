Moving portrait: Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne tells the story of his great-uncle and grandfather

As dusk fell at 6pm  on March 21, 1918, Derrick Osborne, a 20-year-old Lieutenant in the Durham Light Infantry, was killed.

He was shot running across the Morchies Road, in Northern France, in a last-ditch attempt to reinforce his battalion’s right flank and stop it being surrounded by advancing German soldiers. Or so we think.

It was certainly the last time he was seen alive. My great-uncle’s body was never found.

He was billed as ‘missing’, and it was not until a full year later, in March 1919, that his distraught family put a notice in their local newspaper, the Sussex Express, accepting he had died and would never return.

Derrick Osborne was killed after almost two years on the Western Front, and at the end of a long, desperate day of fighting that had started with gas shells raining down on his trenches at 5am.

All day the fighting had raged, as wave upon wave of enemy troops pushed the Durham Light Infantry further and further back.

It was the first day of the great German Spring Offensive of 1918 known  as the Kaiserschlacht, or Kaiser  Battle, that was designed to deliver the decisive blow that would end the war in the crucial months between the exit of the now-revolutionary Russians and the arrival in strength of the Americans.

After the initial breakthrough, the German advance continued for a further seven days and 16 miles until, having over-run the town of Albert, they reached the River Ancre.

There, the Royal Sussex Regiment were the latest group of exhausted British soldiers who had been ordered to try to stop them, and had hastily dug some trenches in Aveluy Wood,  on the other side of the river, from which to mount their defence.

There was bitter fighting, and the Royal Sussex were pushed back through the wood – but they managed to hold on.

The German advance ground to a halt – and it was the furthest point that the spring offensive reached.

The man who helped to command those troops in that final defensive was Derrick’s brother, Major George Osborne – my grandfather.

Sadly, I never met my grandfather. Born in 1894, he was a quiet professional soldier from East Sussex who, before Aveluy Wood, had already been wounded twice in action and mentioned in dispatches.

Family history: Derrick Osborne, a 20-year-old Lieutenant, was killed in the Kaiserschlacht in 1918, the same battle where his brother Major George Osborne –  George Osborne's grandfather - commanded troops

That day, in 1918, he was to win the Military Cross for his bravery. During my childhood, his silver MC with its white and purple ribbon and ‘Aveluy Wood, 1918’ engraved on the back, stared down at me from a display  case in my home.

Alongside it sat the large bronze memorial plaque that commemorated the sacrifice of his younger brother.  It was one of 1,335,000 such plaques, or a Dead Man’s Penny as they were called, that were issued.

I have always looked at the two  sets of medals and wondered at the fate of war. One brother lives, is  decorated for his bravery; goes on to have four children and dies many  decades later. The other is killed as a youth and the only trace he leaves behind is a bronze medallion, a long-faded memory and a name, engraved among countless others on a memorial in the Commonwealth War Graves cemetery in Arras.

If the trajectories of the enemy bullets had been ever-so slightly different, then my great-uncle would have lived and my grandfather  would have died – and my father, my brothers and I and my children would never have lived.

For me, like so many other families, there is nothing abstract about the First World War. It is deeply personal. And it is not just the scale of the slaughter that has struck me. It is the sheer randomness of who lived and who died.

A few weeks ago, I went again to visit
 the battlefields of Northern France with my children. I defy anyone who
 stares at row upon row, column upon column, arch after arch of the 
names of the dead on the Thiepval Memorial, or the Menin Gate in Ypres, 
not to at least ask again the question: What could possibly justify all 
this?

What did my great-uncle and the other  32 young men from his small
 village  in East Sussex die for? Derrick was killed trying to prevent 
the final German effort to win the war – an effort that failed thanks to
 his sacrifice and courage, the courage of my grandfather and of many, 
many others.

Attack: The Kaiserschlacht, or Kaiser  Battle, that was designed to deliver the decisive blow that would end the war in the crucial months between the exit of the now-revolutionary Russians and the arrival in strength of the Americans

It is difficult
 to appreciate now  – because we know the outcome of  the war and all 
that followed – that those fighting it did not know that Britain and its
 Allies would win,  even by 1918. Indeed, faced with the relentless 
German onslaught that spring, Field Marshal Sir Douglas Haig issued a 
plea to all troops that said simply: ‘With our backs to the wall and 
believing in the justice of our cause each one of us must fight on to 
the bitter end.’

So these battles mattered in a war where the outcome mattered.

When
 the commemorations for the centenary of the First World War were first 
being discussed, there was a risk that the reason we fought the war 
would be forgotten. There is always the temptation to present it as 
nothing more than a bloody struggle between rival empires ruled by rival
 royal cousins.

Thankfully,
 we have, as a country, resisted that simplistic interpretation. Britain
 was, for all its imperfections, a democracy seeking to preserve the 
rule of international law on the Continent and resist German militarism.

We know the far-reaching consequences of victory for Britain, and the 
transformation it brought to everything from our attitude to war itself 
to the role of women. We also know the peace didn’t last. But that does 
not make it a conflict without any purpose.

What is unknowable are the even more far-reaching consequences  for Britain had we lost. We do not know what our country would look like today – but it is difficult to believe it would be a better place; in all likelihood it would be very much worse. So I do not accept that  Derrick Osborne and all his comrades died in vain.

And then there is the impact on the living. Some years ago, with my father and his brother, I went to explore Aveluy Wood and to see where their father had won the  Military Cross. There is no sign  or memorial to the struggle there. This was not Vimy Ridge or Ypres Salient; just another forgotten skirmish among thousands of others.

We parked the car by the side of the 
road, walked into a little copse by the side of the ploughed fields, and
 it was as if we had been transported back nine decades.

There,  in the wood, apparently 
undisturbed except by the passage of time, were remnants of the barbed 
wire, the shallow trenches and the shell  holes where my grandfather 
fought and survived.

'I doubt my relatives who fought in Northern France would have imagined it possible that a century later their offspring, and offspring's offspring, would be marching through those woods and honouring their memory,' writes Chancellor George Osborne

There, by the side of the fields, was a row of unexploded German shells, exposed by the latest ploughing, that had been fired to kill him.

And there too was the companionship of the Osborne family, almost 100 years later, brought together in remembrance of part of our own personal history.

Last month I took my own children to visit the same area.

I doubt my relatives who fought in Northern France would have imagined it possible that a century later their offspring, and offspring’s offspring, would be marching through those woods and honouring their memory. I doubt ten years ago that we would have thought it likely that thousands of our schools, our newspapers and broadcasters, and the public at large would take such a close interest in the centenary of the First World War.

I’m sure that the courage of  British soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan has reminded us all of the  sacrifice those in uniform make  to keep us safe.

In an age when we worry about the fragmentation of our national identity, this centenary has reminded us not just of our shared past – but of the ties that bind us still. It was that nation, and those ties, that Derrick and George fought for.

I already knew the story of my decorated grandfather. But the story of my great-uncle’s last day  on Earth is only known to me because of the work of people living in the village of Framfield, in East Sussex, where Derrick and George Osborne grew up.

There, a group of fellow citizens have devoted a huge amount of effort to researching the stories  of the 33 men from the small parish killed in that war. They wrote to me earlier this year, enclosing the research they had done on Derrick.

I am hugely grateful to them, not just because they honour his memory and sacrifice, but also because they have enriched my life, filled in for me part of my family history and connected me with the sacrifice of men who gave everything so that we could enjoy our freedom today.

May the courage of Major George Osborne never be forgotten. May Lieutenant Derrick Osborne rest in peace. And may all who fought and died for our freedom in that almighty struggle be honoured again this year.
