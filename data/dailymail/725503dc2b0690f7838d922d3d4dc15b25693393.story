Blasted: Superdrug admits it has had to stock cheap drinks to lure customers to the store

Superdrug has been accused of fuelling Britain’s binge drinking culture by selling cheap  alcohol in its stores alongside cosmetics.

The retailer, better known for beauty products and in-store pharmacies, admitted it has resorted to stocking cheap wine, beer and alcopops to entice customers into struggling outlets.

But a Conservative MP last night branded its decision irresponsible and called on Superdrug to take the booze off the shelves – accusing the firm of targeting younger customers with its alcohol promotions.

In a branch in Chatham, Kent, customers can buy bottles of wine for just £2.49, while a brand of peach schnapps is on sale for just £4.49 – almost £2.50 cheaper than the same drink in Tesco.

The town’s MP Tracey Crouch, chairwoman of the All Party Parliamentary Group on Alcohol Misuse, said: ‘I’m very disappointed because this isn’t what their core selling is about. They’re about health and beauty products.

‘They are clearly marketing at young, female consumers and I don’t think it’s a responsible thing to do. I share the concerns about cheap booze in supermarkets and Superdrug is contributing to the issue of people pre-loading before they go out in an evening.

‘They should remove alcohol from their stores.

‘Other shops might follow Superdrug’s lead, which will be damaging for our High Street and won’t help us, as a nation, deal with young people binge drinking on cheap booze.’

Her call was backed last night by Crime Prevention Minister Norman Baker, who said: ‘It is not impressive to see a national chain specialising in medicines and health care now dealing in alcohol sales.

'Industry needs to raise its game and do much more to help reduce problem drinking – and retailers have to recognise they have a significant part to play.’

MP Tracey Crouch has attacked the move as 'irresponsible' and a fuel for dangerous binge-drinking culture

The attack comes after supermarkets were criticised for using cheap drink promotions to attract customers.

Prime Minister David Cameron has pledged to crack down on promotional deals, which he blamed for increasing anti-social behaviour turning town centres into the ‘Wild West’.

Another Superdrug outlet in Tamworth, Staffordshire, is selling Echo Falls red, white and rose wine for £4.19. Meanwhile 70cl bottles of the alcopop Caribbean Twist, which sell for £2.50 in most supermarkets, are promoted as ‘great value’ at £1.79.

A store assistant said: ‘The Echo Falls was under £4 recently and the shelves were soon empty. We had to order more. We had San Miguel beer in December and that went quickly.’

But Superdrug managing director Joey Wat defended the alcohol sales, saying it was the only way to stop some branches closing down.

Crime Prevention Minister Norman Baker and Alcohol Concern have also blasted the prices for encouraging 'pre-loading', when teenagers drink before going out

In a letter responding to concerns raised by Ms Crouch about the Chatham branch, he wrote: ‘We sell alcoholic drinks in a very small number of our stores – only six out of 870.

'There is one reason for the sale of alcohol in these stores – to drive footfall and sales as the six are significant loss-making stores and at serious risk of closure.

‘It is the last resort to save the jobs of our people.’

Superdrug insisted the branches in question do not have pharmacies. But responsible drinking campaigners said Superdrug should not be treating alcoholic beverages like another product to increase profits.

Alcohol Concern’s Emily Robinson said: ‘Should shops be selling alcopops and wine beside shampoos and mascaras? This sends out the wrong message about alcohol – it’s not just any product, it can be harmful, addictive and dangerous.

'With alcohol now sold in Superdrug, Argos and a pub on the M40, we would ask the Government whether their licensing rules need to be reconsidered.’

Today Superdrug backtracked over its decision to sell alcohol.

A spokesman said: 'We have decided to cease selling alcohol in the five Superdrug stores which currently offer this range. 

'The introduction of this category into a very small number of stores was a trial to see if this was a product area our customers wanted us to stock, to ensure the continued viability of these stores and to safeguard jobs on the high street.'
