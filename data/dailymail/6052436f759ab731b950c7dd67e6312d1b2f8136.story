A cancer-stricken man on his deathbed claims he watched men bury Jimmy Hoffa's body in a driveway in suburban Detroit a just days after the union boss's disappearance in 1975.

The anonymous tipster reportedly kept the dark secret for 37 years because he was terrified that the mob, who whoever killed Hoffa, would come after him.

The FBI and most observers are skeptical that the Teamsters leader's remains are below the concrete slab in Roseville, Michigan, however one journalist who has talked to the dying man says he is no fraud -- the informant believes his own story.

Where in the world? Jimmy Hoffa, pictured in 1966, was last seen at a suburban Detroit restaurant in 1975. His disappearance remains one of great mysteries in American history

Neighbors say the the house where authorities are searching for Hoffa's body was a possible gambling den in 1975.

They recalled seeing cars coming and going from the home at strange hours, however, the family of four that lived there moved away before police closed in.

A scan by ground-penetrating radar confirmed that the earth below the concrete pad had been disturbed and that there is likely 'something' down there.

However, police and the FBI remain skeptical that it's actually Jimmy Hoffa.

The tipster came forward months ago after first speaking with Dan Moldea, a journalist and author of the book 'Hoffa Wars,' the Detroit News reported.

The man, who has no mob connections, was simply at the wrong place at the wrong time when he watched men bury a black bag -- which he took to be a body -- days after Hoffa disappeared, Mr Moldea said.

Mr Moldea said he, too, is skeptical of the claim.

However, the man is 'adamant' that house is the final resting place of the fame union leader -- who got on the bad side of the mob while leading the Teamsters to national prominence.

'This is not a mob guy. He's not connected. He's just a guy in the right place at the right time, or the wrong place at the wrong time,' Mr Moldea told the News.

'He's scared to death right now. I believe that he believes what he said. He's not a con man. Now, it's a question of whether something is there. If not Hoffa, (maybe it's) a homicide victim or root of a tree. I just don't know.'

Meanwhile, neighbors added to speculation that the house in question might have been involved in a criminal enterprise.

'People going in and out, cars coming at all hours of the night. My neighbor told me police were investigating whether a numbers operation was being run out of here,' one man told WDIV-TV.

Roseville Police Chief James Berlin said his office is 'not claiming it's Jimmy Hoffa' but is 'investigating a body that may be at the location.'

The union boss was last seen outside a suburban Detroit restaurant on July 30, 1975.

His body has not been found despite a number of searches over the years and the case remains one of the biggest mysteries in modern American history.

Unearthed: On July 16, 2003, authorities search under a backyard pool in Hampton Township, Michigan

Other attempts: In May of 2004, investigators ripped up floorboards of a home in the Detroit suburbs where one-time Jimmy Hoffa ally Frank Sheeran claims to have killed him

Hunt continues: In 2006, searchers in formation inspected a field at Hidden Dreams Farm in Milford Township, Michigan

Stadium burial? Self-described hit man Donald Frankos claimed Hoffa was buried under Giants Stadium - which was demolished in 2010

Innumerable theories about the demise of the union boss have been rampant ever since.

Among them: He was entombed in concrete at Giants Stadium in New Jersey, ground up and thrown in a Florida swamp or obliterated in a mob-owned fat-rendering plant. 

The search has continued under a backyard pool north of Detroit in 2003, under the floor of a Detroit home in 2004 and at a horse farm northwest of Detroit in 2006.

After Roseville police received the most
 recent tip, the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality used 
ground penetrating radar on a 12-foot-by-12-foot patch beneath the 
driveway, said agency spokesman Brad Wurfel.

It found 'that the earth had been disturbed at some point in time,' Berlin said.

Berlin said state environmental officials last week found 'an anomaly' while using radar to check the driveway.

The FBI, however, is skeptical.

Former agent John Anthony, who spent years investigating
Hoffa’s disappearance, told WDIV-TV: 'I would say it has no credibility at all. It doesn’t
match up with anything we already know. I'd say it’s just another story - someone
trying to get publicity or looking after a reward.'

A soil sample will be taken Friday and tested at Michigan State University for human decomposition.

Believed dead: Hoffa was declared legally deceased on July 30, 1982, when he would have been 69

A woman who lives at the home on Florida Street told the Detroit Free Press that she's 'fully aware of what’s going on,' but declined to be interviewed.

Police told the paper that the 
homeowner, who has lived at the home for more than a decade, has been 
cooperative in their investigation.

Hoffa was declared legally dead July 30, 1982, when he would have been 69.

He was a union stalwart, serving as its General President from 1958 to 1971 and playing a key part in its growth and development.

During his term as its leader, membership surged to more than 1.5 million members, becoming the largest single union in the country.

After Roseville police received the most recent tip, the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality used ground penetrating radar on a 12-foot-by-12-foot patch beneath the driveway, said agency spokesman Brad Wurfel.

It found 'that the earth had been disturbed at some point in time,' Berlin said.

Results are not expected until next week.

Andrew Arena, who recently retired as head of the FBI in Michigan, told Detroit TV station WDIV that all leads must be followed, but he would be surprised if Hoffa is buried there.
