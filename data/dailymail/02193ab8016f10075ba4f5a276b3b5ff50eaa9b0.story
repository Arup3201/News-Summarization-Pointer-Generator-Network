Sam Allardyce's final act as West Ham manager will be to try to wrestle the title away from Manchester City's grasp this weekend.

Sportsmail understands the decision has been made privately to sack Allardyce following Sunday's visit to the Etihad Stadium.

The 59-year-old has successfully steered the club to top-flight security after a difficult start to the season.

Not a happy bunch: West Ham supporters have grown tired of Allardyce's tactics at Upton Park

But a growing contingent of supporters have turned on the former Bolton boss, despite the team's improvement since the start of 2014.

Allardyce's tactics have become a major bone of contention among Hammers fans, and the anger towards the manager from supporters has not gone unnoticed by owners David Sullivan and David Gold.

And the club's hierarchy will look to appease disgruntled fans by replacing Allardyce after the club's clash against the champions-elect on Sunday.

Allardyce has remained bullish about his job prospects in recent weeks, and will hold a scouting meeting on Thursday as he looks to finalise the club's transfer blueprint this summer.

However, the manager will not have the chance to implement his summer spending plan.

Sections of the Upton Park faithful have been vociferous in their condemnation of Allardyce in recent weeks.Â 

A survey of 12,392 Hammers fans taken 
last month saw 77.95 percent vote in favour of Allardyce leaving the 
east London club this summer.

Little bit of flair: Allardyce has guided the Hammers to Premier League survival for a second year

He was booed by home fans after the final whistle of March's clash against Hull - despite winning the match 2-1.

His last task as Hammers boss will be to secure a shock win at the Etihad Stadium, which could open the door for Liverpool to snatch the Barclays Premier League title away from Manuel Pellegrini's side on the final day of the season.

Realistically, City must only avoid defeat against the Hammers to secure their second league title in three seasons.

However, defeat will hand Liverpool the title as long as Brendan Rodgers' side beat Newcastle.
