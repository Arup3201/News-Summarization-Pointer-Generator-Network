Communication, teamwork and  collaboration are vital components during a significant London project build.

Network Rail engineers  installed a huge new signal gantry  on the approach to London Bridge station and a new timelapse video which captures the development of the project.

The gantry spans 10 of the 11 tracks and a towering crane was transported over from Holland to lift the huge structure.

Team: Network Rail engineers are worked on the London Bridge station rebuild

London Bridge station is being rebuilt by Network Rail as part of the £6.5bn Thameslink Programme.

Further significant works will commence during the Christmas period when sections of the station will be closed for 16 days and engineers will install new state-of-the-art signalling equipment. 

Collaboration: The number of workers increases steadily during the timelapse video

Crane: The crane lifts the gantry into position as the workers congregate to fulfill their various roles

The new development will be a significant improvement on the old system, which dates back to the 1970s.

The approach to London Bridge station is one of the busiest railway lines in Europe.

It is believed the new development will enhance the reliability of services and enable more trains to travel through central London.
