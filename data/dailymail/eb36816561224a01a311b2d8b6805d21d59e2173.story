A former children's nursery worker has been jailed for life today after stabbing her smitten younger lover 24 times during a frenzied attack.

Petite blonde Michelle Mills, 31, used so much force when she attacked management trainee Edward Miller, 20, that the knife penetrated nine inches into his body and the blade broke away from the handle.

Mills then waited 20 minutes before raising the alarm as her besotted partner lay dying on the living room floor of their cottage in the upmarket Leicestershire village of Scalford.

At Lincoln Crown Court today, judge Michael Heath passed a life sentence on Mills and  described her as a 'manipulative woman' who had shown no signs of remorse.

Flanked by a security officer Mills showed no reaction as Judge Heath told her she would serve a minimum of 15 years in jail before being considered for parole.

Judge Heath said: 'This was a brutal, ferocious and sustained attack. You loved each other but you were jealous of each other.

'You were extremely angry with him and you were in a rage. He did not realistically stand a chance of defending himself such was the ferocity of the attack.

'I detect no remorse in you. You have only been concerned with yourself. You did your very best to hoodwink the jury but they saw through you.

'Throughout this trial you have tried to portray yourself as a serial victim of domestic violence, that picture is not an accurate one.

'You are a manipulative woman who strays from the truth when it suits you do to so.'

Mills, at just 4 feet 11 inches tall and described as 'angelic looking', had claimed she feared her boyfriend , who was nearly a foot taller and weighed almost 18 stone, was about to attack her during a Bonfire night row.

But a jury at Lincoln Crown Court rejected Mills' defence and found her guilty of murdering Mr Miller, known to his friends as 'Eddie,' after a three week trial.

The jury heard minutes before the killing Mills had texted one of her 70 previous lovers and told him: 'I still love you and always have. I'm sorry xx.'

In a second text she wrote: 'I wish I'd never let you go xx.'

Moments later she took a kitchen knife and repeatedly stabbed Mr Miller to death as he sat drinking wine on their sofa.

Eddie, a management trainee at the upmarket Scalford Hall hotel, died after the couple argued following a visit to a Bonfire Night party at the village pub.

The jury heard Mills was his first serious girlfriend whereas she admitted to having over 70 previous sexual partners.

Miss Yvonne Coen QC, prosecuting, said 'Michelle Mills was considerably older than her boyfriend and obviously had a good deal more life experience.

'He would have been 18 years old when he met Ms Mills. She was Eddie Miller's first serious girlfriend. It seemed to outside observers they appeared to be completely smitten with each other.

'They were coming to this 
relationship from very different positions. This was his first ever 
grown up relationship with a woman. She was an older woman.' The 
stabbing left Eddie bleeding to death on the living room floor.

Mills
 dialled 999 but despite the efforts of paramedics Eddie was pronounced 
death after being taken to the Queens Medical Centre at Nottingham. He 
had knife wounds to his chest, back and abdomen.

The couple got together when Eddie was just 18 and had already talked about marrying.

Eddie's
 mum Sara Westle said: 'She (Mills) was never shy in saying Eddie was 
the one. We spoke about weddings and wedding dresses. She was convinced 
Eddie was the one.'

Murder: The couple had been seen acting affectionately towards each other at the King's Arms pub in the upmarket village of Scalford before the stabbing

But Eddie had also told his dad, Colin Miller, that Mills had previously pulled a knife on him.

Mr Miller said: 'He said "Look at the size of her. What could she do to hurt me? It was only a small knife anyway.' Mills, 31, of Scalford, Leicestershire, denied murder on November 6 last year.

Speaking after the sentence Detective Inspector Lee Hill from the East Midlands Serious Crime Unit said: 'Michelle Mills is a violent, self centered and manipulative woman.

'She was happy to portray herself as the victim of domestic violence but on many occasions she was the route cause of that violence.'
