There will be a party atmosphere at the Ricoh Arena today but Wasps are already in danger of becoming the noisy neighbours as they begin a new life in Coventry.

Local rivals including Northampton and Worcester will not be welcoming the ex-London club with open arms, with new claims of franchising, under-priced tickets and council secrecy threatening to puncture the euphoria of the occasion.

In an exclusive interview with The Mail on Sunday, Northampton chief executive officer Allan Robson accused Wasps, who announced their move from Adams Park in October, of showing a complete disregard for local clubs and a failure to consult relevant stakeholders.

‘We don’t welcome them,’ said Robson. ‘For the likes of Northampton Saints and Leicester Tigers, this has been our heartland and we really don’t feel threatened. But clubs like Worcester have had to work very hard to expand their territory for commercial benefits and could feel this very badly.

‘If I were Coventry (RFC), then I would be pretty miffed. I somehow don’t think this has been done in collusion in Coventry. There are other local clubs like Moseley, Solihull and Birmingham — I don’t think it’s a very nice thing to have done on Wasps’ part.

‘We knew nothing of it until the whole situation was public. As a partner in a very tight group of rugby clubs, I don’t think it was handled particularly well. It smacks of franchises and that’s not where rugby is currently.’

Shortly after the initial announcement, Worcester voiced concerns about the damaging impact the move could have on their £1.5million academy investment in the region and in 2016 there will be a potential opportunity for Wasps to move their talent catchment area to the Midlands.

Nick Eastwood, the Wasps CEO, said: ‘It’s up to the RFU how they draw the boundaries. There are a lot of anomalies all over the country —some clubs have huge areas and some are very small. We will not do anything whatsoever to put ourselves in breach of that law and we’ll comply with that. The RFU will do what they think is best for English rugby.’

For now, Wasps will continue to train in West London and travel to Coventry on match days. They expect an attendance of more than 27,000 for this afternoon’s match against London Irish. The same fixture attracted just 7,025 at Adams Park last season.

‘There has been a lot of fuss about their 27,000 crowd, but that’s not a sale of 27,000,’ said Robson. 

‘They have given most of them away for free or at heavily discounted rates. The key in terms of their impact in that conurbation will be a season down the line, we’ll see what their average gates are then.

‘I feel sorry the Wasps supporters who have been following their club for a number of years, because the club have just turned their back on them.’

Wasps insist they have given away only 3,000 tickets to local schoolchildren, with the lowest-priced ticket costing £15. With almost 24,000 tickets sold in advance, the club expect ticket revenue of more than £500,000 for Sunday’s match. In the longer term, the club hopes to improve on their average attendance of little more than 6,000. 

With a casino, hotel and restaurants already in place at the Ricoh, they are optimistic they can almost triple their annual turnover to more than £20m.

‘As long as we improve on our average attendance at Adams Park then we’re ahead,’ said Eastwood. ‘Because of the confidential nature of the agreement we were unable to say anything to fans in the lead-up to the sale. The first 48 hours after the announcement was tough but since we’ve had the opportunity to explain the decision I think most fans understand the reasoning.

‘It’s sad if we lose any fans because they’ve stuck through us through thick and thin. But to their credit I think they understand that if it’s the difference between not having a club or having a club in a different place they’d take the latter.

‘It was a case of move or die. It may not have happened next week, or next month but at some point in the not-too-distant future we would have faced insurmountable debts.

‘No one’s going to say “we’d rather you went out of business”.’

The Aviva Premiership outfit are hoping to develop a new fanbase in the area, but that could have a damaging impact on National One side Coventry RFC. Their director of rugby, Phil Maynard, hopes to build a working relationship with Wasps but remains disappointed with the local council for their lack of communication over the relocation.

‘We had one meeting with them in October,’ Maynard said. ‘We didn’t really have much of a say — we were told they were probably going to relocate. If we’ve got a beef, it’s with Coventry City Council. Our beef isn’t with Wasps and it never has been. The issue we had is that the council kept us completely in the dark about it. If this is going to work, it’s important that we form a productive partnership.’
