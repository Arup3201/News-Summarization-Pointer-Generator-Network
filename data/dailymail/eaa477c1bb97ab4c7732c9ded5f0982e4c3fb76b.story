Curbs on immigrants’ access to benefits, the NHS and housing unveiled in the Queen’s Speech prompted a storm of controversy last night.

David Cameron said a crowd-pleasing package of measures would ‘attract people who will contribute’ but ‘deter those who will not’, and hailed other moves to help ordinary families as evidence that the Government is ‘standing up for hard-working people’.

But Labour suggested one proposal – to require landlords to check the immigration status of tenants – risked encouraging racism, while others insisted doctors and property owners should not be made to do the work of immigration officials.

SCROLL DOWN FOR QUEEN'S SPEECH HIGHLIGHTS

Regal: Queen Elizabeth accompanied by Prince Philip, the Duke of Edinburgh, Prince Charles, and Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall at the State Opening of Parliament at the Palace of Westminster

Support: Prince Charles sits next to the Queen in the Lords as she announces 20 bills which her Government hopes to pass in the coming year

Concentration: As his mother reads her speech 
today, Charles and his second wife listen intently to the proposed 
legislation she announced

Loyal: Her Majesty was accompanied as usual by Prince Philip, but the Queen is understood to be concerned not to put too much strain on her husband, who will be 92 next month

The Royal College of General Practitioners said GPs were not prepared to act as a new ‘border agency’ policing access to healthcare.

Some of the measures, including a six-month time limit on benefit claims, a local residency test for council house access and a residency requirement before accessing civil legal aid, will be in place within months.

But those requiring full-scale legislation, including measures to ensure temporary migrants or their governments are made to pay for using the NHS and requirements on landlords and employers to check the status of tenants and employees, are unlikely to be in place in time for January.

That is when controls on Romanian and Bulgarian incomers will be lifted.

Yesterday's Queen’s Speech was billed as an attempt by the Government finally to get tough on immigration. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said the intention was to remove the ‘pull factors’ to Britain. Here, our Home Affairs Editor examines the planned legislation.

DETER ILLEGALS

Plan: Blitz on firms who use illegal labour. Current fines of £10,000 per worker ‘substantially’ increased. Law changed to ban illegals from holding a driving licence.

Will it work? Only if businesses think they will be caught. The number of employers prosecuted was only 1,215 last year – down from 2,092 in 2010. Does nothing to deter the supposed target of David Cameron’s crackdown – the Romanians and Bulgarians who gain free access to the labour market in January. At best, it will reduce net migration by convincing people currently working in the black economy to go home.

NHS

Plan: Force temporary migrants to make a contribution to the cost of their healthcare. Ask non-EU nationals to pay a bond before travelling to Britain. Ask health staff to check a migrant is here legally.

Will it work? Nurses and doctors are livid at the idea of being asked to conduct immigration checks. GP leaders said they ‘have a duty of care to all people’. Identifying migrants who should pay for care is very different from being able to recover the money, once they have received emergency treatment. Critics say the only way to solve the problem is to introduce an entitlement card.

PRIVATE LANDLORDS

Plan: Force private landlords to check the immigration status of their tenants or risk huge fines.

Will it work? Was already descending into a shambles last night with ministers unable to explain how it would work. There are two million buy-to-let landlords in the private sector. Expecting them to guess who might be an illegal migrant on sight is fraught with difficulty. Civil liberties groups claim the plan could amount to discrimination – with legal challenges expected. Large numbers of forged documents in circulation could quickly render the checks meaningless. And some critics say the measures will be limited in effectiveness as illegal migrants could be living in sub-let social housing, sleeping on friends’ floors or in garden sheds.

HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSE

Plan: Restrict appeals in immigration cases. Change law to stop foreign criminals using article 8 of the Human Rights Act – the right to a family life – to thwart deportation attempts in the UK courts.

Will it work? The simplest and potentially most effective aspect of the crackdown. The danger, however, is that Strasbourg – which has shown limited interest in article 8 – will itself begin intervening on family-life grounds. Solving this problem would require withdrawing from the European Court of Human Rights.

RESTRICT ACCESS TO BENEFITS

Plan: Strip migrants of out-of-work benefits after six months if they are not on the verge of getting a job

Will it work? Not in Queen’s Speech but will be introduced at a later stage. Labour say it is a con as existing DWP guidelines state migrants must be ‘genuinely seeking work, and have a reasonable chance of being engaged’ if they wish to continue receiving State handouts. EU regulations say the same thing. So, while it sounds tough, the impact is likely to be limited.Although the Queen’s Speech, which 
included 15 Bills and signalled four others, was finalised before UKIP’s
surge in last week’s council elections, the focus on immigration is 
seen as a response to public concerns which the Eurosceptic party has 
successfully exploited.

The Queen told MPs and peers that her Government’s top priority remained the economy.

But she said an Immigration Bill will 
aim to ‘ensure that this country attracts people  who will contribute 
and deter those who  will not’.

Measures will regulate migrant access 
to the NHS, with incomers expected to be given temporary rather than 
permanent NHS numbers and charged for access to all but emergency 
treatment.

There will also be steps to  prevent 
illegal immigrants from obtaining driving licences, bigger fines for 
businesses using illegal labour and a requirement on private landlords 
to check the immigration status of tenants.

The Bill will make it easier to remove
people from the UK, limiting rights to appeal against deportation. 
Access to benefits will also be limited, and clearer priority given to 
long-term local residents in social housing queues.

In the Commons, Mr Cameron said: ‘Put 
simply, our Immigration Bill will back aspiration and end the legacy of 
the last government where people could come here and expect something 
for nothing.’

He said the legislation was vital as 
Labour had left a system  which was ‘out of control’, with around a 
third of the ‘skilled’ migrants who came to the UK under Labour having 
ended up ‘in low-skilled roles working  in takeaways or as security 
guards’.

The Prime Minister added: ‘Our 
determination to end the last government’s something- for-nothing 
culture is also why  we continue to pursue our  welfare reforms – every 
one of them is about making sure  work pays.’

He pointed out that Labour leader Ed 
Miliband had ordered his MPs to vote against the £26,000 benefit cap and
the one per cent freeze on annual benefits increases. ‘We are standing 
up for hard-working people,’ he said. ‘This is a Queen’s Speech that 
will back aspiration and those who want to get on.’

Mr Miliband insisted the  Coalition 
was doing nothing to boost growth, cut youth unemployment or tackle 
rising living costs and was a ‘tired and failing government’.

‘Out of touch, out of ideas, standing up for the wrong people and unable to bring the change the country needs,’ he added.

Attacking Mr Cameron’s attempt to win 
back some of those who voted UKIP in last week’s elections, Mr Miliband 
said: ‘They used to call them clowns. Now they want to join the circus.’
Labour’s housing spokesman Jack Dromey said: ‘Tackling illegal 
immigration must not take us back to the days when my Irish father was 
turned away from boarding houses displaying “no dogs, no Irish” signs.’

Dr Clare Gerada, head of the Royal 
College of GPs, said: ‘Whilst the health system must not be abused and 
we must bring an end to health tourism, it is important that we do not 
overestimate the problem and that GPs are not placed in the invidious 
position of being the new border agency.’

Jeremy Raj, of the London law firm 
Wedlake Bell, said: ‘Expecting landlords to carry out the work of 
immigration officials is unreasonable and unworkable.’
