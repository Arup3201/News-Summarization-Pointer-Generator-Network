Singing policemen hope that their take on a hit song from Disney's Frozen will put the festive freeze on crime.

PCSOs from Kirklees Central Neighbourhood Policing Team, West Yorkshire, have recorded the catchy song 'Let It Go' from the film - but changed the lyrics to urge the public to be sensible, detract burglars and not to drink drive over the coming weeks.

In the video, PCSOs Jon Arey, Paul Simpkins and Morgan Cockcroft, can be seen posing with 'hooded youths', helping old ladies across the road, and singing the well-known chorus, which has been changed to: 'Ready to go, ready to go, we'll keep you safe from crime.

Singing policemen from West Yorkshire hope that their take on a hit song from Disney's Frozen will put the festive freeze on crime

PCSOs from Kirklees Central Neighbourhood Policing Team, West Yorkshire, have recorded the catchy song 'Let It Go' from the film

But they have changed the lyrics to appeal to the public to stay safe, and discourage crime over the festive period

Featuring in the three-minute film were members of the public, all assisting the officers in their daily duty

'Let us go, let us go, we'll help in this hard time. 

'Call it in, and we'll come to you, let the storm rage on. The rain never bothered us anyway.'

Featuring in the three-minute film were members of the public, all assisting the officers in their daily duty, as well as a school choir who gave a rendition in sign language.

West Yorkshire Police Inspector Jon Dunkerley of the Kirklees NPT, said: 'I am really proud of the lads' efforts in using their talents to create a video that will hopefully entertain, amuse and also inform in equal measures.

They also used the popular hit to deliver a hard-hitting message about drink-driving

The new lyrics include: 'It's funny how some people think it's fine to drink and drive'

'The choice of the Frozen song was unanimous with the team due to its catchy lyrics, immense popularity and appeal to all ages.

'Reworking the lyrics has resulted in a crime prevention take on the smash hit song which puts the message across in a fun yet informative manner.'

The inspector said the three PCSOs had been looking for a new project following the success of Silent Night which attracted over 10,000 hits on Youtube.

In the latest video, the force revealed that in the last 12 months, West Yorkshire Police has reduced burglaries by 13.5 per cent, robbery by 5.6 per cent and violent crime by 5.6 per cent.

The officers were eagerly helped by member of the public who acted in the video

Insp Dunkerley added that the team looked at the information sessions they had given to local schools, residents and groups on a variety of crime types and decided to combine the lot into a single seasonal message.

He added: 'Officers and staff have been working alongside a number of schools and community youth groups in order to make this video.

'We want to thank everyone involved for helping us pull the project together including Huddersfield University who provided assistance by allowing the team to use their recording studio to capture the singing and also provided technical advice.

'We are also particularly grateful to the Children of Spring Grove Junior School Huddersfield and their sign language choir.'
