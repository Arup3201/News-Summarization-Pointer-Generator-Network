A new YouTube video that takes a light-hearted look at Australia is fast becoming an online sensation and could turn out to be the unofficial national anthem over the summer.

From backyard cricket with wheelie bins to a gyrating Peter Garrett of Midnight Oil, the video has a bit of everything. Even former Prime Minister John Howard and The Wiggles make an appearance.

Terry Mann aka Coach Bombay put together the song and video package called ‘Straya!’ which is a cover of Outkast’s number one 2003 hit ‘Hey Ya!’ with appropriate images and lyrics.

Summer madness: A scene from the video ‘Straya!’ leaves nothing to the imagination

Chop gun: Barbecues in the backyard are just part of the clips in the video 

It's hoped that the song will be used to celebrate Australia Day on January 26 

The original idea came from a friend of Mr Mann’s, Calvin Teoh, who posted on Facebook last Australia Day: ‘Sing ‘Hey Ya’’ but replace the lyrics with ‘STRAY. YA.’ Then another friend commented: ‘Get @Terry Mann onto it’.

‘From there I went away and wrote the new lyrics, recorded it and made the video – ready for the next Australia Day. So it was definitely a team effort,’ Mr Mann explained.

‘I don’t think any other song could possibly work as well though. It hinges on that basic play on words.

‘When I started writing the lyrics, I knew that it could easily get carried away with too much negatively and political commentary.

‘And although that opens it up for more satire and ultimately humour, I wanted the overarching feeling and message to be positive.’

Terry Mann aka Coach Bombay from Melbourne put together the song and video package 

Backyard cricket with wheelie bins was another must for the new YouTube video

A video about the joys of Australia wouldn't be the same without a shot of a surfer out on the ocean

The 27-year old is from Melbourne and Coach Bombay is the artist name he uses for performing his electropop music. He said that he didn’t usually make parody videos and that his stage name is a character from the 90s film franchise The Mighty Ducks.

‘I’ve been making music all my life, and releasing my own songs since 2009. Video editing and musical mashups have always been a hobbies of mine on the side. Every now and then, all these interests combine into something like this - as long as the idea is right,’ he explained.

Mr Mann admitted there were a lot of topics to cover in the video, but one clip that he felt had to go in was of former Prime Minister Howard’s infamous hand shake with Mark Latham on the eve of the 2004 Federal Election. 

Beers and barbecues are what it's all about and the new video champions both

‘I really wanted to put John Howard’s cricket-bowling fail in as well, but that would have been a bit too much Johnny,’ he said.

He was also tempted to have a whole section dedicated to Garrett ‘shaking it’, but it would have meant ‘missing out on The Chooky Dancers, The Wiggles, Kylie and AC/DC’.

Mr Mann also thought it would be nice to replace the hashtag ‘#straya’ for a while and use it for something that’s ‘ultimately positive and celebratory’.

His hope is that the ‘Strayla!’ video will be the perfect anthem for Australia day on January 26. 

No video celebrating Australia would be complete without the Sydney Harbour Bridge 

‘I'm hoping that people use it as a form of celebration, especially around the 'Australia Day' period,’ he said.

‘Whether that's to play the song at parties and BBQs, sing a long, do their own versions etc. The term ‘straya’ has been kicking around for a few years now, and it would be great to use it in a more positive sense this Australia Day.

‘Music is my passion, and I'm always trying new things and starting new projects. I don't know where any of them will take me, but it's always fun just to be making music.’
