Southampton have made a move for Belgium international Toby Alderweireld and hope to beat Monaco to a deal.

Manager Ronald Koeman knows the Atletico Madrid defender well having seen him at close quarters while the 25-year-old plied his trade with Ajax in the Dutch league.

Arsenal have also made enquiries to take him on loan from Atletico but the Belgium international is keen to leave Spain to play more games and knows he will get that chance more readily at Southampton rather than The Emirates.

Monaco are happy to do a permanent deal but the player is keen on a move to the Premier League and talks will unfold today.

Koeman is also reviving his interest in Holland international midfielder Jordy Clasie and hopes to strike a deal with former club Feyenoord before the end of the week. The 23-year-old had been expected to join Porto but the delay has given Southampton encouragement as they look to add more creativity to their side.

Rhodes hoping for Hull deal 

Jordan Rhodes is poised to ask for a transfer to help push through a £12million move to Hull City.

The Scotland international senses this could be his best chance of stepping up to the Premier League and the stability Steve Bruce has brought to the Humberside club reassures him it is the right move.

Moving up: Jordan Rhodes is hoping to push through a £12million move to Hull City 

Bruce, who also hopes to finalise terms with defender Michael Dawson from Tottenham, spoke glowingly about Rhodes on Sunday revealing how he thought a deal was done over the weekend.

Blackburn Rovers manager Gary Bowyer has held talks with owners Venky's after they rejected Hull's bid of £10million plus Alex Bruce for Rhodes.

Blackburn issued a statement on Saturday confirming that they had rejected two offers from Hull and that Rhodes was not for sale but Bowyer needs funds to strengthen his squad and sacrificing the prolific striker may be the best solution.

Hull have £12m to spend following the sale of Shane Long and are prepared to throw all of that at Blackburn to get Rhodes who scored in Saturday's 3-2 win over Bournemouth, his 54th in 100 appearances for the club.

Manager Steve Bruce is desperate to bring in a striker. He has been rebuffed in attempts to bring in Danny Welbeck from Manchester United and believes Troy Deeney of Watford to be too expensive at £10m.

Hull may reclaim some of their outlay if Wigan, among other, follow up initial enquiries in Yannick Sagbo.

West Ham show interest in Wollscheid 

West Ham have made enquiries for Bayer Leverkusen defender Philipp Wollscheid.

The 25-year-old centre-back was a target for Hull City boss Steve Bruce while Southampton have also expressed an interest prior to their move for Toby Alderweireld. 

Wollscheid is a Germany international and manager Sam Allardyce has made centre-back his priority position for recruitment over the coming days.

Redknapp wants Diarra reunion

QPR will hold talks over a contract for Lassana Diarra on Monday.

The 29-year-old has been sacked by Lokomotiv Moscow following a dispute with Lokomotiv coach Leonid Kuchuk which culminated in the France international refusing to turn up for training.

Exasperated by the stand-off, the Russian club have taken action and Diarra is heading for London in the hope of signing again for Harry Redknapp.

Sportsmail revealed Rangers' interest earlier this month with the sticking point Diarra's £80,000 a week salary.

However, he is ready to compromise his demands to push through a deal and link up with Redknapp who was his boss at Portsmouth.

QPR are pressing to sign a goalkeeper also with Reading's Alex McCarthy their main target.

They have also been offered Guingamp striker Mustapha Yatabare, 28, but a deal is unlikely at this stage. Manager Harry Redknapp will have to offload players before being able to bring any more in before Monday.

He is keen to keep Loic Remy as the cost of replacing him with a similar calibre player would be more expensive than the £8m to £12m fee set out in his contract.

Everton in the money thanks to Forshaw's Wigan deal

Everton are due a £2million windfall on Monday as Wigan finalise the £4million purchase of Adam Forshaw from Brentford.

The London-based club signed Forshaw on a free transfer with the caveat that they would give Everton 50percent of any sell-on fee.

Forshaw was named League One player of the year last season and has blossomed under Mark Warburton. However, former boss Uwe Rosler has played a big part in persuading him to go to Wigan and he will join later today.

Wigan are also looking to bring in a striker over the next 24 hours. They have been linked with Andy Delort of Tours who held talks with Brentford and Charlton while Southampton and Leeds scouts were also in attendance as he played for Tours against Ajaccio on Sunday.

Tottenham looking to wrap up deal for Sevilla's Fazio  

Sevilla sporting director Monchi says that the club have tried to keep hold of Federico Fazio but Tottenham have agreed to pay his buyout clause of £8million.

Monchi said: 'It seems that Tottenham is willing to pay the [release] clause.

'We are waiting to see the money in the league. We are not going to negotiate with anyone because our desire is to keep Fazio in Sevilla.

'Two months ago we talked about his renewal, but it was not possible. When an English team appears interested in one of our players it is difficult because they can multiply player salaries

'We tried to renew him since last season but the distances were huge even if we were hoping to make a new deal.' 

Tottenham have also considered reviving interest in Swiss centre-back Fabian Schar of Basle as they await offers for Vlad Chiriches.

Tottenham have told Southampton that winger Andros Townsend is not for sale despite an improved £12million bid being offered. Southampton will try again fro Nathan Redmond at Norwich but have other alternatives.

Norwich are waiting news from Vidas Odjidje on whether he will join them this week after they agreed a £3million fee with his club Bruges.

Di Maria edges closer to big money United move 

Manchester United and Real Madrid held discussions over Angel di Maria's transfer on Sunday night with the initial meeting finishing at around 10.30pm. Further talks are scheduled on Monday as United try to reach a suitable accord over the fee.

The clubs are also agreeing terms on United right-back Guillermo Varela. The 21-year-old Uruguayan only joined United a year ago from Penarol but will move to Real Madrid's B team Castilla to play under Zinedine Zidane. The deal is likely to be a loan with a view to a permanent £3million transfer.

More developements are expected with Danny Welbeck soon. The England striker has interest from Everton, Sunderland, Tottenham and Newcastle among others while Galatasaray also want the 23-year-old.

Kalou attracting interest from Sunderland 

Sunderland held talks with Salomon Kalou over the weekend. The 29-year-old is available for £4million from Lille. Gus Poyet was not too happy with the news coming out saying: 'I am going to have to do research at this football club into who is leaking information every week. 

'It cannot be always the player’s agent. A few agents, okay, you can blame them, but there is too much information coming out and I don’t like it. I am not going to comment on any players, sorry.'

Poyet is looking at loans and cheaper deals with the likelihood that if Fabio Borini joins it will also be on loan. That would mean they could not loan Sebastian Coates from Liverpool also.

Former Chelsea forward Kalou has held negotiations with Wolfsburg also but they made it clear they would prefer Lukas Podolski. The Germany international though is waiting for Juventus to agree a loan deal with Arsenal.

Borussia Monchengladbach have also spoken to the Ivory Coast international Kalou.

Meanwhile, Modibo Diakitè could be looking to quit Sunderland and move back to Fiorentina as a free agent. Diakitè would have to buy out his contract with the Stadium of light club.

Bolton eyeing Butland 

Bolton are weighing up a loan move for Stoke City and England goalkeeper Jack Butland.

However, the deal will hinge on Adam Bogdan who has been the subject of enquiries from other clubs but also picked up an injury in Saturday's 2-1 defeat to Brighton.

The Hungarian keeper was injured in a 37th minute collision as Craig Mackail-Smith equalised at the Amex Stadium, leaving the field with a large gash above his left eye.

Manager Dougie Freedman later revealed that Bogdan had also been knocked out in the accident and would have to be checked by a doctor before being allowed to play at Gresty Road against Crewe on Tuesday.

Freedman said: 'Adam got a cut above his eye and got knocked unconscious so hopefully it will be a couple of days of rest and then back on Tuesday. We also have to check to see if his eye swells up or whether it has any effect on his vision.'

Butland is not keen on dropping into the Championship but wants to play with Asmir Begovic entrenched as Stoke number one and heading for new contract talks.

Wolves have made a £1million move for Chelsea midfielder George Saville who has been a target for Middlesbrough. Aitor Karanka could also face more disappointment after Reading became the latest club to move to sign Chelsea's Patrick Bamford on loan. 

Bamford has been a long-term target for Karanka as he looks to add more dynamism to his attack but has six clubs chasing his signature. Saville, who played briefly for Wolves head coach Kenny Jackett at Millwall has become an option after Wolves failed in a bid for Adam Forshaw at Brentford.
