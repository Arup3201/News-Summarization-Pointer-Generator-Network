The captain in charge of the Air France jet which crashed into the Atlantic Ocean in 2009 - killing 228 passengers, including five Britons - may have been with a woman when the plane ran into trouble, it has emerged.

Captain Marc Dubois took more than a minute to return to the cockpit of Air France flight 447 after his co-pilots lost control of the plane during a severe thunderstorm.

What delayed the captain has never been revealed, but two sources say that the 58-year-old veteran pilot was travelling socially with an off-duty Air France flight attendant, Veronique Gaignard.

Jean-Paul Troadec, director of the 
Bureau d'Enquêtes et d'Analyses, France's air accident investigation 
unit, told ABC News that Ms Gaignard was not part of the investigation.

The
agency was 'not interested' in the 'private life of the pilot', Mr 
Troadec told the news network, which revealed Ms Gaignard's presence on 
the flight.

Air France 447 had been travelling 
overnight from Rio de Janeiro to Paris on May 31, 2009, when it ran into
trouble, crashing into the Atlantic in the early hours of June 1.

Disaster: The aircraft was in an aerodynamic stall, but the pilots failed to push the nose down to correct it

Black box recordings revealed that 
Dubois was on a routine break as the plane entered a tropical storm, 
leaving his two co-pilots - David Robert, 37, and Pierre-Cedric Bonin, 
32 - in charge.

As their Airbus A330 rolled from side 
to side in the storm's turbulence, Bonin and Robert - who respectively 
had 2,900 and 6,500 flying hours between them - were unable to bring it 
under control.

They 
desperately called on Dubois for help, but for reasons that have never 
been completely explained, it took him more than a minute to return to 
the plane's cockpit.

Bonin was in control for most of the descent, while Robert took over one minute from impact.

The
emergency began with a stall warning two-and-a-half hours into the 
flight, and nine minutes after Captain Dubois had left the cockpit for 
his regulation rest.

Although
Bonin had told flight attendants to prepare for a 'little bit of 
turbulence', the report highlighted the fact that passengers were never 
warned about how serious the situation had become.

Inexperience? One of the plane's flight data recorders on the ocean bed. Recordings made in the cockpit have revealed the two co-pilots were too panicked to tell the captain what was happening

Instead
the Airbus climbed to 38,000 feet and then began a dramatic rolling 
movement, with Bonin simply getting passengers to fasten their 
seat-belts.

Those on board included Bonin's 38-year-old wife, Isabelle, who was travelling without their two boys, aged 8 and 4.

A detailed analysis of two black box 
flight recorders from the plane has established that airspeed sensors 
had malfunctioned - probably because they had frozen up.

In itself, this was a problem which could have been dealt with, but the co-pilots had failed to deal with a high-altitude stall.

Investigation: More than 600 pieces of 
Air France Flight 447 were sent from Brazil to France by ship to be
studied further

The terrifying end of Flight 447 involved a three-and-a-half minute plunge at 120mph, in the dark, belly first, with the nose slightly elevated.

'It seems that the pilots did not understand the situation and they were not aware that they had stalled,' Mr Troadec told ABC.

All those on board - who came from 32 nations, including five from Britain, three from Ireland, and two from America - died after the plane hit the sea at a speed of 180 feet a second.
