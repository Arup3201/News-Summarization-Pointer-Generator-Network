A revolutionary new haircare system has been developed which promises to give you thicker, fuller, and longer hair in just three months.

The Salon Science AnaGain range, which was developed by Dr Bernhard Irrgang with the help of  celebrity stylist Andrew Jose, uses stem cells from rare plant extracts - much like many face creams - to boost and build the hair.

According to Dr Irrgang, the product promises not only to given denser and thicker hair but it also helps to prevent hair loss, protects your hair from everyday wear and tear and promotes growth from the root.

It's a hair care dream! The Salon Science AnaGain range promises longer and thicker hair in just three months

It sounds too good to be true - so how does it work? 

He explained: 'The AnaGain collection is formulated with a powerful Organic Pea Sprout extract that helps to initiate the growth of new hair and encourage the growth of existing hair.'

According to Dr Irrgang, at any given time the hair on most people's heads will be going through two different phases. 

Most of the time the majority of the hair - 85 percent - will be in the anagen or 'growth phase'. Meanwhile the other 15 percent of hair will be in the telogen or 'hair loss' phase. This means it is growing and shedding simultaneously.

Dr Irrgang said their product enhances the 'growth phase' and reduces the 'hairloss phase'. 

He said: 'The AnaGain regime leads to reactivation of hair growth by reducing the amount of hair in the telogen phase and stimulating anagen hair in the growth phase.

'As the product helps to increase the number of hair in the anagen phase, the hair gets denser and fuller. 

Research: The Salon Science AnaGain range underwent clinical trails which showed how the products helped to boost hair growth

The results: After using an AnaGain gel the panelists saw a marked improvement in their hair

Man behind the products: Dr Bernhard Irrgang is the head of research and development for Salon Science 

'As the hairs in the anagen phase are being supported, hair becomes more vital and healthy which in turn helps to encourage hair growth by 80 per cent compared to normal levels.' 

And the results do seem to be pretty impressive. 

Of a select panel who tested the product, which is currently available exclusively at Boots, 95 per cent found the look of their hair improved and they had less hair loss.

Harnessing stem cells from plants has been used to create creams and lotions for the body and face for sometime so using it in hair products is a natural progression.

Dr Irrgang explains why the stem cells they use are so beneficial: 'AnaGain is based on Organic Pea Sprouts; a plant material known to have a high level of phytonutrients. The Pea is a vegetable with pod fruits. Each pod contains several peas which are rich in proteins, starch and fibres that protect the plant from disease, dangerous pathogens and UV pollutants.

'These health promoting phytonutrients are also known to exert beneficial effects on human hair by inducing dermal papilla cells [at the root of your head] to initiate the growth of new hair.'

The Salon Science team recommend that you use the three AnaGain products together, firstly washing with the shampoo, conditioning and then using the Proacellerant treatment which specifically targets hair loss. Their wider range of products includes volume building shampoos and mousses and a Swiss Grape range with helps to repair and protect damaged hair.

Andrew Jose uses the Salon Science products at his salon in Charlotte Street, London 

Andrew Jose, who helped to develop the Salon Science range, heads up his own salon in London, has been working in the hair care industry for more than 20 years.

During that time, he's amassed a number of celebrity clients.

Amongst others, he's styled, preened and generally made fabulous the tresses of Jane Fonda, Alanis Morissette, Louise Redknapp and Jodie Kidd getting them red carpet ready on many an occasion. 

He said: 'The red carpet is a showcase of polished, effortless yet timeless hair that is luxurious and elegant. The hair styles are chosen to perfectly complement what the artist will be wearing so requires precision planning.'

So what are his top tips for paparazzi ready locks? 

1. Match your hair to your outfit

When choosing a show stopping hairstyle, bear in mind that less is more. If you have a statement gown, then keep the hair simple, if you have a simple gown then the hair can become more of a statement!

2. Be prepared!

Make sure your red carpet hair schedule incorporates your colour appointment to ensure colour will be at its very best. Plus you should always carry an emergency fix kit, a couple of bobby pins, a small backcombing brush and a handbag sized hairspray are essential! 

3. Don't be too clean

This may shock some people but I always recommend that my clients wash hair the day before putting it up to combat hair being too slippery. After washing apply SALON SCIENCE® Swiss Apple CELLUMAX™ Foam  to damp hair at the roots. Flip hair over to one side and blow dry hair in that direction until 80% dry and flip the hair back to the other side and blowdry again in the opposite direction to create maximum volume at the root.

 4. Pick a style that suits your face shape

Take into consideration head shape and the balance of your facial features when choosing a red carpet style. A style that is soft and flattering on most face shape is the low chignon or bun. Always tease hair at the crown to give volume and leave soft tendrils around the face.

5. Back comb, back comb, back comb but don't rush it

Teasing (back combing) and dry shampoo is a must have when creating a red carpet style – for volume and staying power. But remember great hair takes time DON'T rush it! If you are creating the style yourself, practise your look as some techniques can be challenging. Trial your style the day before to get it right on the night.
