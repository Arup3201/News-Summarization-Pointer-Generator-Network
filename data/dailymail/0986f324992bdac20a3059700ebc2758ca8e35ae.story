Russian police are hunting poachers who butchered two polar bears after their grisly remains were found on an island in the Arctic Sea.

The bears were found by a research team that included experts from the World Wildlife Fund who were sent to check on their welfare.

Corpses of two animals - one of which was dismembered - were found in the snow on the remote island of Vaygach this week.

Polar bears are hunted down in a barbaric trade where poachers sell on their skins, often to 
wealthy Russians who consider them the ultimate hunting trophy.

Many poachers are willing to risk imprisonment in their quest to bag one.

'A
 recent polar bear research project was staged on the island which 
turned up the corpses of the two bears,' said a regional police 
spokesman.

'They were 
killed with high-powered hunting rifles and snowmobile tracks - the 
vehicles used to pursue them - were found nearby.'

Grim: Bear meat was found in a deserted building at the Fyodorov Meteorology Station and two hours later the body of a polar bear was spotted from a helicopter during the research team's investigations

Participants in the research scheme 
included experts from the World Wildlife Fund, the Marine Mammal 
Council, the National Research Institute for Environmental Protection 
and a member of the Russian Federal Security Service's border service.

'The very first day of the expedition we found evidence of the polar bear kills,' added the police spokesman.

An examination concluded that the bear had been shot and killed just a few hours before its body was found.

'It should be noted that the polar bear is listed in Russiaâ€™s Red Data Book,' said head of the WWF Polar Bear Patrol project Viktor Nikiforov, referring to the country's document listing rare and endangered animals.

'Also, penalties have been increased for poaching, capturing and transporting polar bears.

'Thanks to our work with the border service, we managed to uncover two cases of poaching in one day. We hope that the poachers will be found and punished soon.'
