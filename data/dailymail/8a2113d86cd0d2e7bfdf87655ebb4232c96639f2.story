Calls are growing for an investigation into Channel 4’s controversial drama, Ukip: The First 100 Days, after nearly 2,000 viewers complained about its ‘biased’ portrayal of what life might be like under Nigel Farage’s party.

The spoof, which mixed scripted scenes with archive footage, suggested Britain would be gripped by race riots and mass unemployment if Ukip came to power.

Ofcom received about 20 complaints before it aired on Monday night and more than 1,650 afterwards.

Channel 4 also received more than 250 comments, although the state-owned broadcaster did not say how many of those are negative.

John Hemming, Liberal Democrat MP for Birmingham Yardley, said last night that Channel 4 had abused its position as a public service broadcaster. He wants the broadcasting regulator to investigate why it was allowed to be shown.

‘Channel 4 and the BBC are not supposed to be biased – though we all know they tend to be biased,’ he said.

‘If Britain left the European Union we would probably end up in the EEA [European Economic Area], and we should reflect that.

'It is misleading to exaggerate the situation. I would be shocked if Ofcom did not investigate.’ 

UKIP: First Hundred Days showed investors such as Airbus pulling out of Britain, after the country quit the European Union – one of Mr Farage’s key election promises.

The economy crashed and thousands of workers immediately lost their jobs, in Channel 4’s dystopian vision, sparking protests and riots around the country. 

Gerard Batten, UKIP MEP for London and party general election candidate for Romford, slammed the depiction as ‘bile and vitriol’.

‘Political debate is one thing, and having a debate where people can put another point of view, or even a factual documentary about a political party. But this wasn’t that.

‘I’m not quite sure what you would describe it as apart from a piece of bile and vitriol from our political opponents, who don’t happen to be in a political party, they’re in a TV channel and don’t have to go through the inconvenience of running for office.’ 

Viewers took to Twitter to express their fury: ´This is so biased from a mainstream media [organisation], it makes me furious - and I don´t even support UKIP,’ one said.

Another wrote: ‘I’m no UKIP fan, but this hatchet job Channel 4 is doing on them is quite anti-democratic and quite outrageous.´

Ukip’s leader Nigel Farage tweeted: ‘Looks like 100 Days of Ukip may well have backfired on Channel 4. A biased, partisan depiction of the only party that Believes in Britain.’ 

Douglas Carswell, who became Ukip’s first elected MP last October, said: ‘We are doing a great deal of work in the key seats that Ukip is focused on winning and the Channel 4 mockumentary reinforces the view amongst those voters that we are presided over by a smug, arrogant, out-of-touch commentariat class.

‘The mockumentary was supposed to damage Ukip but I think it’s reinforced the sense of cultural alienation and I think it makes people more likely to vote for Ukip against the cartel in Westminster.'

Channel 4’s head of documentaries, Nick Mirsky, said a ‘lot of research’ had gone into the film and he thought it was ‘fair’.

A spokesman for the broadcaster added that it had stuck to Ofcom’s rules to be ‘fair, accurate and duly impartial’.

‘This rise of UKIP’s electoral support is one of the biggest political phenomena in recent years and this is reflected in The First 100 Days, which used policies and statements made by the party and its members to create a fictional future where the party is in power,’ it added.

‘Channel 4 has a role to encourage debate and engage viewers in political issues – and the schedule will include a broad range of programming in the build up to the election including news and current affairs investigations, a party leader debate and a major new political drama on the formation of the coalition government.’
