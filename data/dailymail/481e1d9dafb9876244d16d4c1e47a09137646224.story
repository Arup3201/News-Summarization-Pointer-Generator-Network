Flawless: The Duchess of Cambridge has been showcasing an unrivalled glow on her Royal tour and now FEMAIL can reveal exactly how she gets the look

Kate, 32, is said to be keeping her skin in tip-top condition on her tour of Australia and New Zealand with the help of her favourite Lancome Hydra Zen face cream and Advanced Genifique serum.

The new mother was reportedly sent the products, which she is said to have been a firm fan of for years, in mid-March.

The £39.50 face cream claims to moisturise and soothe skin for long-lasting hydration, perfect for those long, sunny days on tour and for getting over the drying effects of a long-haul flight.

Enriched with naturally-derived plant extracts, it promises to relieve skin from environmental skin aggravation and, if used every morning, it will apparently help create a radiant, glowing complexion.

Get the glow: Kate is said to use Lancome Hydra Zen face cream, £39.50, and Advanced Genifique serum, £59, which claim to help beat wrinkles and even skin tone

Royal seal of approval: Kate is said to be a long-standing fan of the brand's Hypnose Mascara and Artliner, which she wore at her wedding and apparently recently stocked up on in Peter Jones

The £59 
serum is said to help restore youthfulness, with supposed benefits including smoothing fine lines and deep wrinkles, boosting radiance and increasing elasticity.

As for her make-up, Kate is said to be a long-standing fan of the brand's Hypnose Mascara and Artliner, which she also wore at her wedding.

The Duchess reportedly snapped up a fresh supply of the products from a beauty adviser in Peter Jones a couple of months ago, ahead of the tour.

The £20 Artliner is akin to a felt tip and thanks to its fast-drying benefits, promises never to smudge - ideal for Kate's long days on tour and countless photo opportunities.

Speaking about Kate's beauty look, and how you can achieve it at home, Shehla Shaikh, Lancome Head of Elite Team, said: 'The Duchess of Cambridge's look is classic and elegant with a daytime smoky eye, which compliments her bright wardrobe during the tour.

'Starting with fresh matte skin, the eyes are smudged softly with a charcoal shadow to add softness.

Bee beauty: Kate has also previously been reported to love the organic Heaven bee venom facial she was given by skin care guru Deborah Mitchell, as recommended by Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall

'Then the top and bottom lash line are defined with a liquid liner (this could be achieved by Lancome Artliner) and several coats of black mascara (this could be achieved by Lancome Hypnose mascara).

'Freshness is added with a rose pink blush on the apple of the cheeks and matching lips to balance the whole look.'

Kate has also previously been reported to love the organic bee
venom facial she was given by skin care guru Deborah Mitchell, as recommended by Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall.

Camilla
has long been a fan of beauty therapist Deborah Mitchell, who treats 
her regularly with the facial, hailed as a ‘non-surgical 
facelift’ - the organic alternative to Botox.

Other make-up bag essentials come courtesy of Bobbi Brown, who revealed that Kate is a big fan.

The beauty brand, which is fronted by Katie Holmes, released a statement after the Royal Wedding saying that one of their make-up artists 'provided make-up artistry assistance to members of the bridal party'. 

The former Kate Middleton apparently loves their Long-Wear Even Finish Foundation, Sheer Colour Lip Gloss, and Creamy Matte Lip Colour.

They also helped her achieve her statement brows and the secret of Kate's face-framing look is a £15.50 eyebrow shadow powder.

The Duchess may look like she was born with dark, defined brows, but in fact she was taught how to use clever products to boost them, as her own natural brows are fairer and slightly patchy.

Kate is a frequent visitor to the Bobbi Brown counter at the
 Peter Jones store in London’s Sloane Square.

It is understood that 
staff taught her to apply a deep brown shadow, designed for the brows, in a shade called 'Saddle'
 with a slanted make-up brush to 'fill-in' her brows.

The products seem to be working their magic; the Duchess of Cambridge looked flawless as she and husband William, along with baby Prince George flew into Australia's capital Canberra on Sunday following an action packed day at Sydney's Taronga Zoo.
