It was a battle of claw versus jaw, but the king of the jungle reigned supreme in his battle against a crocodile.  

The two killing-machines fought over feeding rights at a Kenyan river in Samburu, Africa after the crocodile tried to take the lion's lunch - a dead elephant.

The lion was among a pride that was about to eat the elephant when the crocodile crawled up and tried to take a bite. The lions then began to drive the beast away by clawing and biting at the armoured reptile's legs.

Jaws versus claws: The lion and the crocodile square-off at a Kenyan river in Samburu, Africa, after the reptile tries to take the big cat's lunch

Paws for thought: The lion lifts one of its paws and prepares to strike the crocodile which lunges forward baring its teeth 

Eventually the crocodile retreated to the safety of the deeper waters. 

Photographer Hung Ta, 50, captured the battle unfolding.

He said: 'For a while there was a Mexican standoff with neither making the first move but I believe the lion was fearing for the safety of its cubs and made the first move.

'It wasn't long before other lions moved in and began to claw and bite at the legs of the crocodile all the while making sure to stay clear of its huge jaws. 

Dine in, but not takeaway: The lions guard the dead elephant and appear to be looking towards the water cautious of the crocodiles intentions 

Lowest of the low: The crocodile slides along on its belly as a young lion hovers on the waters edge, keen to deter it from lunging futher

Fancy a pedicure? The lion nips at the reptiles claws as it thrashes about in pain, trying to edge back into the safety of the water

Two on one: An adult lion and a young cub leap at the crocodile whose open mouth looks big enough to swallow them whole 

Back you go: A lion bites the soft underside of the reptile, left, as another stands on its back and attempts to push it away 

On your tail: The crocodile seems to acknowledge defeat as three lions straddle its rear quarters and force it back into the water 

'The crocodile actually tried to get closer for a second time but was soon overwhelmed so it backed off.'

Mr Hung said it was 'amazing' to watch the fight. 

He said: 'It's not very often these two predators fight and neither animal underestimated its opponent.'
