The world’s smallest country could become the next host of the Olympics, if the Vatican has its way.

Rome has launched an audacious bid for the 2024 Games, despite being in the midst of the city’s worst corruption scandal for decades.

Prime Minister Matteo Renzi said that other Italian cities from Florence to Naples, could also be involved.

And the Holy See could also host some of the sporting events, both in the Vatican Gardens and at the Papal summer palace at Castel Gandolfo, a senior cardinal has proposed.

Ambition: Pope Francis is to meet the head of the Italian Olympic Committee on Friday for discussions

The pope is to meet the head of the Italian Olympic Committee on Friday for discussions.

Cardinal Jose Saraiva Martins said he believed Francis would approve of the motion to hold events such as archery in the Vatican gardens.

He said: ‘But why stop there? The holiday residence of the pope at Castel Gandolfo would be perfect and would also bring new energy to the people around Lake Albano.

He said: ‘The Vatican has always encouraged sport as a vehicle of healthy values. I think Francis will approve.’

The cardinal added: ‘The church has always defended sport because its values are not only Christian but universal. 

'It teaches you how to put human values such as compromise and collaboration in practice overcoming division.’

He said he would like to see Olympic football matches played at the Vatican ‘as it is a great passion of mine as well as of the pope.’

Francis is a card-carrying member of his local team San Lorenzo in Buenos Aires. He has been vocal in his support of sport sending a special message to the football world cup in Brazil and blessing ‘the diplomacy of cricket’ when a new Vatican Catholic team played an Anglican side.

Rome was a fortnight ago hit by a mafia scandal in which 100 people including the former mayor were placed under investigation for fixing public contracts and siphoning off money meant for the poor and needy.

The corruption scandal could damage its chances of winning the competition. The EXPO 2016 in Milan has also been tarnished by corruption allegations.

Rome's was the first bid to host the 2024 games, with the US expected to pitch this week. A final decision will be made in 2017.
