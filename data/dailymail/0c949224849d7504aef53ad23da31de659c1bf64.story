Dani Alves has been offered a new Barcelona deal according to the player's agent, Dinorah Santana.

The full-back's contract expires in the summer with Manchester United and Liverpool among a number of Europe's top clubs keeping tabs on the Brazil international's availability.

Alves has been linked with a move away from the Nou Camp all season, but Santana has revealed there is a deal on the table from the Spanish giants offering to extend the 31-year-old's contract at the Nou Camp.

'On Monday, I had a meeting with [director] Javier Bordad,' Santana told Sport. 'On Wednesday I have had the second meeting. I have already received an offer [for a new contract], although I can't say if I am happy or not [with it].

'There will be more meetings. They told me they will call me to arrange the next one.'
