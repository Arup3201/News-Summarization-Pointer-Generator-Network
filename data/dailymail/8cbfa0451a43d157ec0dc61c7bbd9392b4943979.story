A father-of-four has been charged with attempted murder after he allegedly agreed to pay a hitman $5,000 to kill his ex-wife. 

Dallas W. Brumback Jr from Sterling, Virginia, was arrested on Thursday after he allegedly met with someone he knew in November 2014 and asked him to murder his ex-wife.

The 35-year-old is accused of paying $2,500 up front for the hit, with the other $2,500 set to be handed over once the job was done - but the deed was never completed.

Brumback is believed to have divorced from the alleged target - whom he had one daughter with - years ago and now lives with his new wife and their three daughters.  

He is said to be maintaining his innocence and those around him are 'suspicious' of the allegations.

His defense attorney, Caleb A. Kershner, told the Washington Post: 'He seems to be a very solid family man, an individual who is cared about by a lot of people.'

Brumback's father, Dallas Snr, said he was shocked by the news of his sons arrest. 

Brumback Jr. was being held Friday without bond at the Loudoun County Detention Center. 

A spokeswoman for the Loudoun County Commonwealth’s Attorney said he was arraigned Friday morning, charged with attempted capital murder and is next scheduled to appear in court Monday for a bond hearing. 

It remains unclear what may have motivated him to arrange the hit. A preliminary hearing for the case has been set on March 11.
