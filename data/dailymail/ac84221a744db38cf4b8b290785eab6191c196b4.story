Kneeling on a pillow, surrounded by mothers and their children, the Countess of Wessex looked perfectly at ease as she took part in a musical play session in Peterborough, Cambridgeshire, yesterday. 

Cuddling three-month-old Rowan Wilson-Jones, the royal laughed happily as the youngster sucked on her hand as she joined in on a sing-a-long for toddlers.

After greeting flag-waving pupils gathered in the playground of Wittering Primary School, the Countess made her way to the children's centre - which she renamed the Wittering Families' Centre.

There she delighted the children - and their parents - by singing nursery rhymes including Humpty Dumpty and Incy Wincy Spider, according to the community group that organised the session.  

The Countess, who is a long-standing supporter of children's charities, spent time cuddling the children - rocking three-month-old Rowan  as they took part in the fun with his mother Emma.

She looked unfazed as the baby sucked on her hand - looking down and smiling at the little boy. 

At Wittering Primary School, which she last visited in May last year, Sophie crouched down to speak to the pupils who shrieked with delight as she walked into the playground. 

She also took the time to speak to a number of different groups and chat to parents.

Earlier in the day, the Countess visited RAF Wittering, just south of Stamford, Lincolnshire, in her capacity as Honorary Air Commodore of the station. 

The helicopter carrying Sophie touched down at the base mid-morning, where she was greeted by pupils from nearby Wittering Primary School. 

She was handed bouquets by two year six pupils, before she headed to met with service personnel in the officers' mess.

During her tour of the base, which she visits regularly, Sophie awarded good conduct, long service and overseas service medals and certificates.

She also spent time meeting with the families of servicemen and women currently serving in the RAF, as well as speaking with some of the units which will relocate to the station in the coming months. 

Dressed in a chic ensemble of a black jacket and a navy skirt teamed with nude heels, the 49-year-old was every inch the royal style icon as she toured the RAF base - stopping to look inside a Grob Tutor aircraft.

While at the base, the Countess watched an aerobatic display and met with members of Cambridge University Air Squadron. 

The visit came in the wake of a busy month for Sophie, who has spent most of it touring the country and hosting charity suppers at Buckingham Palace.

Last week, the Countess delighted pupils at the Royal School for Deaf Children in Margate, where she greeted a number of youngsters with a warm embrace.  

Earlier that day, the Countess had spent the morning raising the profile of another cause close to her heart, the plight of people suffering from cancer.

In Tumbridge Wells, she visited the local hospital, being shown around the decontamination unit before officially unveiling a memorial to staff who perished during the First World War.

Afterwards, she was driven to the nearby Pickering Cancer Drop-in Centre, which helps support anyone affected by the disease. 

Next month is also set to be an engagement-packed one, with a visit to Buckinghamshire, including a tour of the spinal injuries unit at Stoke Mandeville Hospital, among the highlights.

Her husband, Prince Edward, also has plenty in his diary, starting with a trip to Birmingham early next week.
