Ski slopes were open in France today for what is already being viewed as the most dismally cold summer in living memory.

Despite it being the first weekend in June, the Pyrenees resort of Porte Puymorens was selling piste passes ‘like hot cakes’.

‘We have hundreds of people here enjoying the snow – it’s just like the middle of January,’ said a spokesman for the ski station, where mountains peaks rise to 2,827 m (9,275 ft).

Freezing weather: An icy spring means that the mountains of southern France are still covered in snow

Slopes were originally shut at the end of the official season in April, but because there was so much snow left an ‘exceptional opening between June 1st and June 2nd’  was announced.

An icy Spring  means that the mountains between France and Spain are still covered in snow, with Eric Charre, the director of Porte Pymorens, saying people should ‘take advantage of all the snow that has not melted’.

There were heavy falls across the Pyrenees throughout April and May, leading to regular avalanche alerts.

Stations in fact had to shut down at one point during the winter because there was too much snow. 

Mr Charre said that slopes running between 1600m and 2500m in altitude ‘have as much snow as there was in winter’.

He added: ‘From 2,100m upwards, everything is still pristine without any tracts of earth showing through at all. ‘The snow is on average 70cm to 80cm thick and in some places there are still drifts of up to five metres deep’.

Temperatures at the ski station reached a maximum of 1°C this week, said Mr Charre.

Fun on the slopes: Locals made the best of the coldest spring for 25 years by wrapping up warm and heading to the mountains

Some 600 skiers a day were allowed up in the resort’s cable cars this weekend, so as to avoid overcrowding.

In total, four pistes will be opened on Saturday and Sunday, after which the snow was considered too slushy for skiing.

It has been the coldest Spring in France for more than 25 years in some parts of France, meaning snow which should have melted weeks ago is still in place.

While glacier skiing is common across France in May, June skiing is normally associated with countries like Sweden.
