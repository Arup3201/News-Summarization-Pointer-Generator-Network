Round (centre) also held a coaching role at Manchester United under David Moyes

'We’re all here to help the players and if I can bring anybody in to help them in terms of coaching or off the field aspects, we’ll do that.' 

Round started his playing career with the Rams in the early 1990s and the full-back went on to make nine first-team appearances.

Jim Smith offered him a coaching role at the club after he was forced to retire from the game early.

Round will work with Derby’s backroom staff once or twice a week as they bid to clinch promotion to the Premier League.
