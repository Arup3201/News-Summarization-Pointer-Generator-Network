Elderly people who show signs of dementia, but do not yet have Alzheimer's, have a 30 per cent lower risk of dying from cancer, a study has found.

Although scientists cannot explain how, it appears OAPs with memory and thinking problems are less likely to develop cancer.

The Spanish study put over-65s through thinking skills and memory tests and followed the participants for an average of 13 years.

Lower risk: A Spanish study found that over 65s showing signs of dementia, but not yet diagnosed with Alzheimer's are 30 per cent less likely to die of cancer

It found that the group which had a fast decline in performance in the tests were 30 per cent less likely to die of cancer.

‘Studies have shown that people with Alzheimer's disease are less likely to develop cancer, but we don't know the reason for that link,’ said study author Dr Julián Benito-León of University Hospital 12 de Octubre Madrid, Spain.

‘One possibility is that cancer is underdiagnosed in people with dementia, possibly because they are less likely to mention their symptoms or caregivers and doctors are focused on the problems caused by dementia. The current study helps us discount that theory.’

The study involved people age 65 and older who did not have dementia at the start of the study.

They took tests of memory and thinking skills at the start of the study and again three years later, and were followed for an average of almost 13 years. 

The participants were divided into three 
groups: those whose scores on the thinking tests were declining the 
fastest, those whose scores improved on the tests, and those in the 
middle.

No links: Although it appears over 65s with memory and thinking problems are less likely to develop cancer than those who do not, scientists could not answer why

During the study, 1,003 of the participants died - and 34 per cent were in the fast decline group.

A total of 21 percent of those in the group with the fastest decline died of cancer, according to their death certificates, compared to 29 percent of those in the other two groups.

People in the fastest declining group were still 30 percent less likely to die of cancer when the results were adjusted to control for factors such as smoking, diabetes and heart disease, among others.

‘We need to understand better the relationship between a disease that causes abnormal cell death and one that causes abnormal cell growth,’ Dr Benito-León said.

‘With the increasing number of people with both dementia and cancer, understanding this association could help us better understand and treat both diseases.’

The study was published in the online issue of Neurology, the medical journal of the American Academy of Neurology.
