One day, he'll be king. Yesterday, however, Prince William was just an avid racegoer so absorbed in the action that there was only one way to get his attention.

Though whether the chap attached to this tweed-clad arm would dare to tweak his ear quite so firmly then is another matter…

It certainly tickled the Duchess of Cambridge, who giggled as her husband eventually realised what was going on and turned to smile at his friend.

Got a bet on? The two appear to be enthralled by a moment on the track

... Kate keeps an eye on the race and a tight grip on her betting slip - and lets her famous composure slip for moment

William appeared to be in a playful mood yesterday as the couple enjoyed a day out at the Cheltenham Festival.

They watched the races from a friend's private box, where they were joined by wildlife presenter Ben Fogle and his wife Marina.

As he arrived, punters asked William who they should bet on and he replied chirpily, 'a horse'.

But when he was asked whether he and Kate, who is five months pregnant, were having a boy or a girl, he simply smiled knowingly and tapped his finger on his nose.

The ear-tweaking incident happened during the first race, which William watched intently.

Both he and Kate seemed delighted when Our Conor crossed the line as the runaway winner. The duchess, who appeared to clutch a betting slip in her left hand, cheered and clapped, while the duke shouted 'come on' and beamed as Our Conor came in first. 

Picked a winner? From Kate's expression it looks like today could have been her lucky day

Kate, 31, concealed her bump beneath a
 double-breasted Joseph coat, in a blush colour which matched her 
radiant complexion. She teamed the coat with a brown hat and brown suede
 boots.

She joined William on the balcony to 
watch the first two races, chatting excitedly with friends and placing 
her hand on the shoulder of a female companion.

But by the third race, she had retreated into the warmth of the suite where she stayed for the rest of the afternoon.

Royal approval: Prince William taps his nose to show he's got his finger on the pulse of horse racing

It meant she missed the 
much-anticipated Gold Cup – even though Mike Tindall's horse, Monbeg 
Dude was running.

He bought the horse on a drunken whim at a charity 
auction for £12,000. His wife Zara Phillips, his mother-in-law Princess 
Anne and his brother-in-law and his wife, Peter and Autumn Phillips, 
also turned up to support the ex-England rugby captain.

But the royal seal of approval did not bring him luck and Monbeg pulled up at the second-to-last fence.

Hot tip: The Duchess of Cambridge and Prince William, Duke of Cambridge, got for a bet

Miss Phillips – who apparently called 
him 'an idiot' when he bought the horse four years ago – was seen 
resting her head on her husband's shoulder and looking glum as they 
watched the race from the parade ring.

During the Gold Cup, William found his
 loyalties divided as he cheered on both Tindall's horse and Long Run, 
which was ridden by his friend Sam Waley-Cohen. But as 33-1 outsider 
Monbeg Dude lagged hopelessly behind, the duke focused on Long Run, 
shouting 'come on Sam' at the top of his voice as it secured third 
place.

It was revealed this week that Kate had 
been feeling much better after suffering badly at the beginning of her 
pregnancy, and had even been spotted indulging in a pastry when picking 
up her morning coffee at Starbucks.

ELSEWHERE AT CHELTENHAM...

Thoughts of many at the Festival were 
with leading amateur jockey JT McNamara, who remains in hospital in a 
coma after suffering a serious neck injury when his horse fell.

The Irishman, 37, fell at the first 
fence while riding Galaxy Rock for trainer Jonjo O'Neill in the Fulke 
Walwyn Kim Muir Challenge Cup.

JT McNamara could undergo surgery. Medical staff were quickly on hand to treat him after the fall, 
and he was airlifted to Frenchay Hospital in Bristol by air ambulance 
from the Gloucestershire course.

McNamara's uncle, the trainer Andrew McNamara, said: 'I've been told that JT is in an induced coma at the moment.'

Dr Adrian McGoldrick, chief medical officer for the Irish Turf Club, reports there to be no change in McNamara's condition but confirmed the rider has damaged two vertebrae.

'There has been no change overnight. He's still in the induced coma,' said Dr McGoldrick.

'It is a fracture of the C3 and C4 vertebrae. He will probably be going for surgery this morning but we will know more later in the day.'

More than 200,000 people are expected to attend the four-day race meeting, which is one of the highlights of the national hunt season.

Gate receipts are estimated to reach £7 million and bookmakers are anticipating a record-breaking year with industry turnover tipped to surpass the £600 million barrier.
