Michelle Knight’s disappearance never received the attention that Amanda Berry and Gina DeJesus got when they went missing.

Following their rescue on Monday, Berry and DeJesus triumphantly returned to their families with public celebrations. Knight is estranged from her family and did not receive the same public welcoming.

About two hundred Cleverlanders wearing red ribbons turned out Saturday afternoon to ensure that Knight, 32, does not become the ‘forgotten’ victim of alleged kidnapper Ariel Castro.

None of the families who showed up for the march knew Michelle Knight or had even heard of her case before she was rescued from the house on Seymour Avenue on Monday night

‘We want her to see that we’re here and that the whole city of Cleveland loves her and we’re here for her no matter what,’ Fawn Cassidy, 44, from the city’s West Side, said.

Unlike Amanda and Gina, Michelle was an adult when she vanished in 2002. Her mother reported her missing, but police later concluded that she had likely run away after the state took away her baby. 

Her disappearance prompted no local media coverage and the FBI removed her case from its missing persons database after just 15 months.

‘When she disappeared, at one point, she was forgotten. Nobody knew she was gone. She just got lost in the shuffle,’ Toni Urban, 56, said.

None of the families who showed up for the Michelle Knight march knew her or had even heard of her case before she was rescued from the house on Seymour Avenue on Monday night.

However, they all said they felt moved by her story – especially her lack of family support.

‘As a mother, I know that this woman needs a family. She needs someone there for her after what happened,’ said Clara Perala.

Michelle’s relations with her mother Barbara, who moved to Naples, Florida, are strained. Michelle reportedly did not want her mother visiting her in her hospital room.

Barbara has retained a lawyer to fight to see her daughter.

She has also not contacted her great aunt, Deborah, who has been the public face of the Knight family since news about Michelle broke.

On Friday Michelle was released from the hospital and reportedly taken to the home of Gina’s parents, Nancy and Felix DeJesus.

A neighbor, Lupe Collins, told MailOnline that the DeJesus family was trying to ‘adopt’ Michelle as their own daughter because she and Gina grew so close during their time in captivity.

The marchers began at MetroHealth Hospital and walked to Seymour Avenue where they vowed to never again let a missing woman fall through the cracks and be forgotten by the system.

Despite the pledge, Cleveland police have revealed in the second district alone – where Castro’s house is – there are currently 71 missing people and only one detective assigned to work missing persons cases.

Knight, who was the first captive of the house on Seymour Avenue, was horrifically beaten. She requires facial reconstruction surgery to repair the damage Ariel Castro allegedly inflicted as he bent her to his will.

Deborah Knight told the New York Daily News that Michelle was brutally gang raped in high school before she was ever abducted.

She had a child from the attack, who was later taken from her be state child protection workers. 

Well-wishers of Amanda Berry left cards, gifts, balloons - and this young girl even left a bicycle - as a show of support in front of the home of Beth Serrano - Berry's sister
