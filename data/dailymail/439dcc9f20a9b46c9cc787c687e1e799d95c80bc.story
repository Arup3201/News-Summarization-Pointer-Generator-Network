Maths teaching in schools should be overhauled, with the introduction of Asian-style daily teaching and a focus on fundamentals, the Education Secretary has suggested.

Michael Gove has signalled a return to academic rigour in the maths curriculum amid concerns that the UK is lagging behind other countries.

He suggested daily maths lessons and regular tests are to be adopted, inspired by the system in Singapore, with the possible return of ‘numeracy hour’ – a Labour initiative scrapped two years ago. 

Summing it up: Michael Gove (left) wants a return to academic rigour in the maths curriculum, with fractions and algebra teaching given a boost

Under his proposals, lessons for primary school children are to focus on fractions and the building blocks of algebra.  

And those in secondary school will study advanced calculus and statistics – currently the preserve of A-level students.

Mr Gove also suggested that within a decade all children should study maths in some form up to the age of 18 – which will be the school leaving age from 2015.

 The proposals come amid concerns that half the adult population lacks ‘basic maths skills’.

English schools are slipping down international league tables in the subject while countries such as Singapore, Japan, China and Korea steam ahead. At the age of 15, pupils in China are around two academic years ahead of British counterparts in the subject.

Primary pupils need to be taught maths every day to prepare them for secondary school, Mr Gove says

In a speech to the Royal Society 
yesterday, Mr Gove said: ‘If we are to keep pace with our competitors, 
we need fundamental, radical reform in the curriculum, in teaching, and 
in the way we use technology in the classroom.

‘Unless we dramatically improve our performance, the grim arithmetic of globalisation will leave us all poorer.’

Mr Gove will publish details of reforms following the national curriculum review.

Dame Athene Donald, chairman of the 
Royal Society Education Committee, welcomed  his proposals. She said: 
‘The UK has a proud track record of achievement in science and 
engineering, with the most productive research base among leading 
economies. 

‘However, we need to place science 
and innovation at the heart of the UK’s long-term strategy for economic 
growth if we are to remain competitive, and at the apex of this must be 
inspiring the next generation of scientists, mathematicians and 
engineers.

‘The Education Secretary’s recognition that more students should be studying maths and for longer is particularly welcome.’

Currently, maths is compulsory up to the age of 16.

Only around 13 per cent of pupils, some 85,000, take it at A or AS-level each year.
