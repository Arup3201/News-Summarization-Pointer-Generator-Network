One of the most iconic settings in American cinema history is up for sale: 'The Godfather' mansion. And the owners are waiting for someone to make them an offer they can't refuse.

The home of the Corleone family in the 1972 film is 'to die for' with its 6,248 square feet including seven bedrooms and five bathrooms, according to the Staten Island Advance. 

The Staten Island estate is on sale through Connie Profaci reality, a real estate agency based in New-Dorp, for $2.89 million, according to the Advance.

For Sale: The home of the Corleone family in the 1972 film is on sale for $2.89 million 

Francis Ford Coppola had an artificial wall built around the home for filming so that it seemed like a compound in the movie

The  exterior of the English Tudor style mansion was used in the movie to shoot such memorable scenes as Connie's wedding.

Though the inside of the home was never shown in the film,  the current owner has made many improvements to the home, and some of those were made to look like the interior of the home in 'The Godfather,' like Don Corleone's office, according to the New York Post.

The house, built in 1930, was the home of the Norton family for almost 60 years, until they put it up for sale in 2010, according to The Guardian. Before that, it was owned by former Borough President Joesph Palma, who lived there with his wife and 11 children. 

The current owner reportedly purchased the estate in 2012 for $1.7 million and renovated it to include a gym, a playroom, four garages, two offices, and a pool, The Guardian reports. 

The home also includes a new dining room and kitchen as well as an exercise room, according to The Guardian.

'The kitchen is to die for,' estate agent Joseph Profaci told the Advance. 'It has anything you would want for entertaining – big open space, a huge island, and a very large eating area that opens up to the yard and pool.

'My favorite feature of the house is a door on the first floor by the dining room that looks like an old, wood 'speak easy' door that leads down to the basement where there is a pub and a game room, which really is the ultimate man cave. It has a big, beautiful stone fireplace in it.'

The home got its claim-to-fame when it was recommended to location scouts by Staten Island-native Gianni Russo, the actor who played Carlo Rizzi, Corleone's son-in-law, The Guardian reports.
