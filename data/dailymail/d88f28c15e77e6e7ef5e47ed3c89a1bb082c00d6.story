Hearing: Jimmy Savile's former flatmate Ray Teret covers his mouth with gloves outside Manchester Crown Court today

Jimmy Savile's former chauffeur appeared in court today charged with 15 counts of rape against young girls dating back to the 1960s.

Ray Teret, 72, a former pirate radio DJ who once shared a flat with the shamed BBC star, is accused of a series of sex offences over almost 35 years.

He appeared alongside two other men also charged with sexual offences and the hearing was told the trio are expected to deny all the allegations.

Teret, dressed in a dark suit and overcoat with a purple scarf, was not asked to enter any pleas during the brief hearing at which he was told his trial would take place next year.

He was first arrested in November last year on suspicion of a historic rape before being charged with a total of 32 sexual offences earlier this month.

Teret shared a flat with Savile in Manchester in the 1960s, working as a DJ at stations including Radio Caroline under the nickname 'Ugly Ray'.

Teret faces 15 counts of rape of girls aged under 16 and one of an adult, a girl who was 17 at the time.

He was also charged with one count of attempted rape, nine counts of indecent assault - three of them against girls aged under 14 - and one count of gross indecency with a child under 13.

Teret, of Altrincham, Greater Manchester, also faces two counts of conspiracy to rape a girl under 16, one count of possession of extreme pornography, one count of possession of prohibited images and one count of possession of an indecent image of a child.

Suspects: William Harper and Alan Ledger also appeared in court today on a series of child sex charges

Acquaintances: Jimmy Savile lived with Ray Teret in Manchester, and he was also driven by him in the 1980s

The alleged rapes and sexual assaults 
date from between 1962 and 1996, with the vast majority said to have 
taken place in the 1960s and '70s.

They relate to a total of 15 alleged victims, all but one of them aged under 16 at the time.

He appeared in the dock at Minshull Street Crown Court in Manchester alongside William Harper, 65, of Stretford, who is charged with conspiracy to rape a girl under 16 and attempt rape of a female under the age of 16, and Alan Ledger, 62, of Altrincham, who is accused of indecently assaulting a female under 16 and aiding and abetting the rape of a female under 16.

All three were released on bail with conditions including not contacting any of the alleged victims, with a plea hearing scheduled for next April and a trial in October.

Teret left court holding a pair of gloves over his mouth and did not comment to reporters before he was driven away.

At the time of Teret's arrest, Greater Manchester Police emphasised that the accusations were not linked to the national inquiry into abuse by Savile.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
