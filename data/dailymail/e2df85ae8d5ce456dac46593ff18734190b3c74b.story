It's nicknamed 'murderball' because it's such a fast-paced, contact sport - and Pippa Middleton learnt why as she watched a wheelchair rugby match today.

The sister of the Duchess of Cambridge had her hand across her mouth in disbelief at times as the players barged one another on the pitch at the Invictus Games. 

And her expression was not surprising... since among those playing in the celebrity game were her brother-in-law Prince Harry. 

Her stunned look was mirrored by Autumn Phillips, sitting beside her husband Peter, whose sister Zara was also competing along with her husband Mike Tindall.

It was revealed this week that the pair are set to become an aunt and uncle again as their sister, Kate, is pregnant with her second child with Prince William.

She was unable to join her siblings to watch the sporting event as she has been suffering from severe morning sickness. 

Earlier, the Prime Minister David Cameron said the Invictus Games could become a permanent fixture and confessed to being moved by its opening ceremony.

Like the Middletons, he also soaked up the atmosphere of the Games by watching the British Armed Forces team beat Denmark in their opening wheelchair rugby match at the Copper Box Arena.
