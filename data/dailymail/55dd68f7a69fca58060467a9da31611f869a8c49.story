Shake-up: Homeland Security chief Jeh Johnson said some illegal immigrants had earned the right to U.S. citizenship

Illegal immigrants must be able to become citizens in order to keep America safe, the man charged with protecting the country has declared.

Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson said that around 11 million people who are in the country illegally have 'earned the right to be citizens'.

Mr Johnson said: 'An earned path to citizenship for those currently present in this country is a matter of, in my view, homeland security to encourage people to come out from the shadows.

'It is also, frankly, in my judgment, a
 matter of who we are as Americans.

He used his speech to more than 270 mayors at the United States Conference of Mayors in Washington, D.C. to call for 'comprehensive, common sense, immigration reform'.

Mr Johnson added: 'To offer the opportunity 
to those who want to be citizens, who’ve earned the right to be 
citizens, who are present in this country - many of whom came here as 
children - to have the opportunity that we all have to try to become 
American citizens.'

'Comprehensive immigration reform would also promote a more effective and efficient system for enforcing our immigration laws, and should include an earned path to citizenship for the approximately 11-and-a-half-million undocumented immigrants present in this country, something like 86% of whom have been here almost 10 years.'

Mr Johnson's intervention came as House Republican's prepared to reveal their plans for a shake-up of the immigration system.

Speaker John A. Boehner of Ohio and other Republican leaders will also call for illegal immigrants to be given the oportunity to gain legal status - but stop short of calling for them to be able to become citizens.

The 2012 Presidential election results showed more than ever the changing face of the American voting demographics.

Mitt Romney won the biggest share of the white vote that any Republican White House contender ever has — and he still lost.

In an election battle that was defined as much as anything by race, Mitt Romney won the support of 59 per cent of whites, but just 27 per cent of Latinos, 26 per cent of Asian-Americans and 6 per cent of African-Americans.

Thirty years ago, being unpopular with ethnic minorities would hardly have stopped a white establishment candidate like Romney from trouncing Barack Obama.

But back then, whites accounted for almost 90 per cent of voters.

Now they make up just 72 per cent of the electorate, and that figure is shrinking by the year.Tuesday’s election showed a large turnout by Hispanics, who constituted some 10 per cent of voters — more than ever before.

With 71 per cent of them voting for Mr Obama — notably in a handful of crucial swing states such as Florida, Colorado and Nevada, where they turned out at the polls in unusually high numbers — Hispanic voters gave the President his winning margin.

They are expected to demand tougher border security during their annual retreat in Cambridge, Maryland later this week.

This apparent softening of the Republican stance would see the party attempting to reach a consensus with the Obama administration.

In June, last year, the Senate passed a measure reforming immigration which included a 13-year path to citizenship.

Mr Johnson, who took up the role of Department of Homeland Security chief in December, also reiterated the need for effective border policing, adding: 'Border security is inseparable from homeland security.'

'The five core missions of the 
Department of Homeland Security are guarding against terrorism, securing
 our borders, enforcing our nation’s immigration laws, safeguarding 
cyberspace and critical infrastructure in partnership with the private 
sector, and supporting emergency preparedness and response efforts at 
every level,' Johnson said.

'Common
 sense immigration reform is supported by the U.S. Conference of Mayors,
 businesses, and if the polls (are) to be believed, the majority of the 
American people,' Johnson said.

'And
 border security must and should be part of comprehensive immigration 
reform – protecting our borders, securing our ports, promoting the 
lawful flow of trade and travel through our ports to cities and other 
communities,' he said.

Johnson
 touted the alleged improvement in border security over the last four 
years and said comprehensive immigration reform also would increase that
 security.
