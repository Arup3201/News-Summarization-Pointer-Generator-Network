Harrowing new details have emerged in the alleged June rape of a female Vanderbilt University student involving four college football players.

Vanderbilt tight end Brandon Vandenburg, safety Cory Batey, defensive Brandon Banks, and receiver Jaborian 'Tip' McKenzie were suspended and indicted last month for allegedly raping a 21-year-old co-ed June 23 and videotaping the assault.

On Saturday, the site BuzzFeed revealed information about the night of the sex assault, during which 
the players linked to the case allegedly smashed through a security door
 before one of the suspects covered a surveillance camera in the hallway
 with a towel.

Another explosive allegation that has emerged since the August indictments is that Coach James Franklin may have instructed one of the football players to erase the video recording depicting the rape of an unconscious woman.

Mr Franklin has vehemently denied that claim.   

On June 23, Brandon Vandenburg, a star player who had recently transferred to Vanderbilt from College of the Desert in California, went on a date with a 21-year-old Oklahoma native.

The two went to a bar called Tin Roof, and on the ride back Vandenburg's date reportedly passed out in the car.

According to accounts of several Vanderbilt students, the 21-year-old was then carried to Vandenburg's room on the second floor of Gillette House.

Date night: On June 23, Brandon Vandenburg took a 21-year-year woman out on a date to the Tin Roof bar, after which she passed out

Crime scene: Police say the star player brought his unconscious date to his second-floor room in the Gillette House dormitory, where he proceeded to rape her

Several students later recalled hearing a loud bang that night, which turned out to be the sound of a door being knocked off the hinges in the second-floor hallway.

The force with which the door was broken would eventually lead authorities to suspect that football players may have been involved.

Investigators working on the case believe that Mr Vandenburg brought his passed-out date to his room and had sex with her without consent, with three of his teammates present at one point or another in the course of the night.

According to BuzzFeed sources, unnamed objects were also employed to sexually penetrate the unconscious student, and Vandenburg used his cell phone to allegedly take graphic photos and record video, which he later sent to four people.

It remains unclear whether the alleged rape victim remained in Vandenburg’s room until the next morning, or whether she was carried to another room in the dormitory.

Another arrest: Wide-receiver Chris Boyd is being charged with accessory after the fact for allegedly trying to help the four accused rapists cover up the sexual assault

Sex crime: Four Vanderbilt University football players were indicted earlier this month in connection with the June 23 rape of an unconscious 21-year-old girl in a dorm room

However, multiple sources agree that a
 towel was placed over a security camera so that the 21-year-old could 
be discreetly moved through the hallway.

According
 to the website’s sources, the young woman - described by friends as 
fun-loving but hard-working – only found out about what had happened to 
her on the night of June 23 when she was made aware of the existence of 
photos and video recorded inside Vandenburg’s room.

In
 the aftermath of the rape scandal, Coach Franklin, who has been 
credited with revitalizing Vanderbilt’s football program, told reporters
 that the allegations break his heart both professionally and 
personally.

However, it has
 been suggested by a BuzzFeed source close to one of the defendants that
 Franklin may have encouraged a player to delete a video of the incident
 after the player showed it to him.

Franklin’s
 attorney, Hal Hardin, has said that his client strongly denies it and 
has been cooperating fully with the investigation.

All seven men linked to the rape case have posted bail and are now free. Vandenburg was released Wednesday on $350,000 bond.

Cory Batey, 19 of Nashville, Tennessee; Brandon Banks, 19, of Brandywine, Maryland; Jaborian 'Tip' McKenzie, 19, of Woodville, Mississippi; and Brandon Vandenburg, 20, of Indio, California, were charged with two counts of aggravated sexual battery in early August.

Vandenburg was also charged with one count of tampering with evidence and one count of unlawful photography.

Freed: Brandon Vandenburg was released from jail this week on $350,000 bond

Wide receiver Chris Boyd, 21, was indicted August 16 as accessory after the fact for allegedly giving the suspects advice on how to cover up the sexual assault.  

Two acquaintances of Vandenburg, Miles Joseph Finley, 19, and Joseph Dominick Quinzio, 20, have been charged with tampering with evidence.

Vanderbilt dismissed the players June 29 and barred them from the campus pending the investigation. At the time, Ms Fortune said that their first thoughts are for the victim, a Vanderbilt student, and that the university will continue to offer her all of its services and support.

'We are shocked and saddened by the allegations that such an assault has taken place on our campus and that they include members of our football team,' she said in a statement.

According to Nashville police, the four men are charged with raping the unconscious woman inside Vandenburg's room at Gillette House dormitory early June 23. University officials checking the dorm's surveillance in the hallways on an unrelated matter noticed the four's behavior and notified the Vanderbilt University Police Department the night of June 25. Campus police contacted Nashville's sex crimes unit June 26.

Vanderbilt did not identify the four players until July 15 before the Commodores headed to Alabama for Southeastern Conference media days.

Grave allegation: It has been suggested that Vanderbilt head coach James Franklin may have instructed a player to erase the video of the June rape - but he denies it

None of the four played a snap for Vanderbilt last season. Batey came in last season as a receiver and redshirted behind Jordan Matthews and Chris Boyd before switching to safety this spring.

Banks also redshirted as a freshman last season. His attorney Grover Collins declined to comment on the indictment but said last month that Banks is innocent and fully cooperating with police.

McKenzie redshirted in 2012, but the 5-foot-8 receiver had four catches for 83 yards in the Commodores' spring game -- the most yards receiving in the game. His attorney, Jodie Bell, did not immediately return a message by the AP. The 6-foot-5 Vandenburg was considered one of the top junior college tight ends nationally coming out of Xavier College Prep, and he became the first junior college transfer at Vanderbilt since Jordan Rodgers in 2010.
