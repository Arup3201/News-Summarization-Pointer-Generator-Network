A young mother was beaten up on a night out by a woman who was apparently jealous that she was carrying a large wad of cash.

Amy Rae Ferris took out £200 from a cash machine in order to buy Christmas presents for her children, shortly before popping into a bar for a drink with friends.

But a woman who saw her pull out the banknotes ambushed her in the toilet and brutally beat her, leaving her covered in blood.

Warning: graphic images

Attacked: Amy Rae Ferris, 24, was beaten up in a bar because she was carrying a wad of cash

Damage: The young mother had to go to hospital after the brutal and unprovoked attack on Saturday

The attacker took the 24-year-old's money, then went back to her friends at the bar and carried on drinking.

Ms Ferris was helped out by another reveller, who took pictures of her horrific injuries before taking her to hospital after the attack at Pic's Bar in Bury, Greater Manchester.

'I feel lucky to be alive as there must have been up to 40 blows to my head,' said Ms Ferris, who has a six-year-old son and a daughter aged four. 'She didn't say a word during the attack - she just kept hitting me.

'I was left on the floor in a pool of blood. I managed to crawl out although I'm not sure if I had been knocked out for a few minutes.

'A lady came and she went to get help and I was escorted out of the back of the club while [the attacker] was still drinking at the bar like nothing had happened. I can't believe someone could do that to another person.'

Night out: Ms Ferris had been relaxing with friends before popping out for food and a drink

Bloody: Ms Ferris had a badly cut lip and had to be treated for her injuries in hospital

The attack on Saturday night came after Ms Ferris had been enjoying a 'girlie night in', and decided to go out to get food with a friend in the early hours of the morning.

On the way, they went in to Pic's and ordered a Sambuca and Coke each.

'I had withdrawn £200 from a cashpoint because I wanted to go shopping for my children's Christmas presents the next day,' she said.

'We walked past the bar and we thought we would just go in for one cheeky one before we went to get food. We went to the bar and I bought two drinks with the money I had just taken out.

'After paying for the taxi, cigarettes and the drinks I had £170 left in notes then a bit of loose change so I rolled it up and stuffed the money into my shoe.

Venue: The attack took place around 2.30am at Pic's Bar in Bury, Greater Manchester

'When I was in the toilet I felt a hard blow to the face. Then I felt more blows to my head and I fell to the floor.

'Every time I tried to get back up I was pushed or kicked back to the floor. I must have received over 30 or 40 blows. It went on for quite a long while and I was left in a pool of blood on the floor.

'I managed to crawl out of the cubicle and I was escorted out of the back of the bar by staff. I think the woman saw me take the money out to pay for my drinks and I think that's why she attacked me.

'I just remember sitting in Accident and Emergency for four hours. I was shivering but I felt hot at the same time. I was just confused about what had happened to me and I was in so much pain. My head was throbbing. It felt like a really bad migraine.'

A woman has been arrested over the incident by Greater Manchester Police.
