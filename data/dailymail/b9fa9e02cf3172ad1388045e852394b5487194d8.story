Pre-election pledges to boost NHS funding are not enough to keep the health service free at the point of use, leading medical experts have warned.

In the run up to the general election next year, the Tories, Lib Dems and Labour have all vowed to increase spending on the NHS. Ed Miliband promised the biggest boost to health spending of the main three parties - vowing to hike the NHS budget by £2.5billion a year.

But an influential coalition of doctors, nurses and medical charities has warned that the promises are nowhere near enough to fill the £30 billion black hole which has left the health service at ‘breaking point’.

The NHS needs an extra £30billion a year to keep it free at the point of use for everybody, medical charities have warned

In an open letter to the leaders of all three parties published by the Independent, the leading organisations said ‘the longest, and most damaging budget squeeze’ in NHS history had left the service in crisis.

Health spending has been protected from the austerity cuts imposed across most of the rest of Whitehall but had not risen enough to prevent the hospitals and surgeries ‘buckling under the twin crises of rising demand and flatlining budgets’, they wrote.

The letter was signed by the heads of the British Medical Association, the Royal College of Nursing, the Royal College of GPs and four other royal colleges, the Alzheimer's Society, the Anthony Nolan Trust, the MS Society, the Royal National Institute of Blind People, the Teenage Cancer Trust, the Family Doctor Association and the Faculty of Public Health.

They said: ‘Savings have been made, and despite the best efforts of nurses, doctors and other staff, patients have not been insulated from these cuts. Too many staff feel undervalued and demoralised when all they want is to be able to care for patients.

‘A shortage of GPs means that patients are struggling to get an appointment to see their doctor. Pressures on maternity services mean that many women are not getting the high quality care they deserve.’

Accident and emergency unit targets were being missed - in some cases for an entire year - patients faced ‘unacceptable’ waits for cancer diagnoses, and patients requiring emergency mental health support were being moved to hospitals hundreds of miles away from home.

Social care shortfalls meant dementia sufferers ‘have been cut adrift, reliant on unpaid and unsupported carers to live from day to day’ and problems were being stored up for the future by a failure to invest properly in children and young people's physical and mental health, they suggested.

David Cameron announced that a future Tory government would increase spending on the NHS every year

‘The NHS and our social care services are at breaking point and things cannot go on like this. An NHS deficit of £30 billion is predicted by 2020 - a funding black hole that must be filled.

‘While we welcome the fact that the NHS has risen to the top of the political agenda, and some new spending commitments have been made, we need a comprehensive, fully costed, long-term spending plan if an NHS true to its founding principles of universal healthcare, provided according to need not ability to pay, is secured for future generations.

‘It must also take into account the need for vital social care. This will also require a guarantee that the NHS will be protected from another top-down reorganisation which is not in the best interests of patients, and distracts from the severe, long-term funding pressures facing the health service.

The NHS, social services, health and care professionals and above all, the British people, deserve no less.
