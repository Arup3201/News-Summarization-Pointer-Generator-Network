Ronny Deila’s vision of fast-paced goal gluts from his Celtic side seems light years away, rather than one threatening to put in an appearance at some stage of 2015.

Four days shy of the turn of this year of change and during a time of transition for the Premiership champions, Ross County were able to dig in for a draw thanks to gutsy defending and Celtic’s shocking creative shortcomings.

At least January 1 will open up the market for Deila to go shopping for inspiration. For that was sadly lacking in this dismal display that won’t bring the crowds back to Parkhead any time soon.

It’s a sorry state of affairs when the day’s positive for the grumbling Celtic support was points dropped at Perth by closest-pursuers Dundee United.

Celtic extended their lead to five points thanks to St Johnstone’s victory — a gap sure to be targeted now by an Aberdeen outfit offered encouragement about mounting a challenge by this blunt effort.

This was a County team that Celtic slammed five past in October at Dingwall at a canter, a fact that asks yet more questions of the signs of progress Deila claims to be witnessing during his working week.

They have disappeared at the weekends, clearly, and on this form, the trip to Firhill on Thursday could be as tricky as a few of the old traditional Glasgow derbies staged on New Year’s Day.

Jim McIntyre’s men, now without a victory in six, have never won at Celtic Park and only with one crack at goal from Filip Kiss with six minutes remaining did they flirt with the upset of the season.

Even their joy at this superb result was diluted by dropping to the foot of the table on account of St Mirren’s victory, but this point could prove a precious one come May if they can start scoring wins against their bottom-six rivals.

The stalemate was secured despite personnel problems. Jackson Irvine being ineligible to play against his parent club forced McIntyre into one of his four plotted changes. That soon became five when a back spasm felt by Graham Carey in the morning got no better from a combination of medication and a warm-up. His replacement, Michael Gardyne, lasted all of 38 minutes before hobbling off himself.

Following a minute’s silence for the victims of the George Square bin lorry accident, Deila began the bid to tease more goals from his side by fielding three strikers. Leigh Griffiths was rewarded for his scoring cameo in defeat at Tannadice with a first Premiership start since August 23, alongside Anthony Stokes and misfiring John Guidetti.

That three became a two when Stokes succumbed to an early calf problem and Callum McGregor was introduced after only nine minutes. Yet for the bulk of the contest, the on-loan Swede was up top on his own with the curiously ineffective Stefan Johansen his closest support act, while Griffiths remained a non-factor on the flank.

Guidetti was clearly greedy to get back among the goals as he grabbed the chances to let fly from free-kicks. He ruffled the side-netting rather than the County keeper, who was drawn to make a save only once in the first half. 

It was a feisty affair with tempers flaring on both sides as referee Crawford Allan tried to keep the peace

The defensive banks brought south to keep Celtic out were solid in their deployment, such a contrast to that 5-0 thumping two months ago, and great credit to Paul Quinn, Scott Boyd and company for limiting Celtic opportunities.

Even on the occasions Celtic succeeded in stringing together a menacing move, there was always a boot or, in the case of Kiss, a hand in the way to stall what momentum the home side had mustered.

The battle for a point was then fuelled by injustice. Emilio Izaguirre was on a yellow card when committing a bookable offence as County broke with the tireless Yoann Arquin, and the visitors made their feelings known to referee Crawford Allan.

Celtic were making hard work of it with 11 men, so quite how they would have constructed a swashbuckling attack with 10 is not something the home fans would’ve wished to consider during their half-time break.

McGregor took early and ambitious aim at breaching County’s resilience, cleverly carving out space for a 25-yard drive that cannoned off the crossbar.

Guidetti’s poor form stalked the follow-up as the Swede stumbled into the rebounding ball and missed the open goal with the keeper floored.

The toils of Celtic begged for significant change and there was no surprise when Guidetti made way for Stefan Scepovic. After netting 11 in 10, Guidetti is now without a goal in five.

McGregor, meanwhile, was dealt the insult of being a substituted substitute as Kris Commons appeared in his place for what was meant to shape up as a late assault on Antonio Reguero’s goal.

Yet they offered no signs of being an upgrade in creative or clinical terms and, a quarter of an hour later, the next chance of the game fell to the visitors.

On the break, Kiss cracked a 20-yard drive off the base of the post with Craig Gordon at full stretch, to the relief of the Celtic support.

The first scoreless league draw at Celtic Park since October 2011 was greeted by jeers — an understandable reaction from a dejected home crowd.
