A man from Oakland, California spent five years recreating all the dishes from one of the best restaurants in the world in his very own home. 

Alinea in Chicago is more than just a restaurant it's a savory explosion. Chef Grant Achatz's three star Michelin reverie uses molecular gastronomy to create otherworldly dishes such as edible helium balloons and chocolate spheres that erupt open onto the plate.

Allen Hemberger dined at the Chicago restaurant once in 2008 and after his final course spent the next five years creating over 400 dishes in a journey he calls, 'The Alinea Project.'

Did it himself: Allen Hemberger dined at the Chicago restaurant once in 2008 and after his final course spent the next five years creating over 400 dishes and researching every aspect of them 

Pop art: One of the artfully designed items on the menu is an edible helium balloon that tastes like Apple 

Multi-faceted: The dishes have different textures and ingredients, some of which evoke emotional reactions

Hemberger, who worked as a visual effects artist by day, spent years researching how to make each dish, where to buy the ingredients, and even hand crafted certain utensils used in the restaurant when he couldn't find them in the store.

In a short documentary about the gastronomic journey directed by Daniel Addelson, Hemberger details how what began as a hobby turned into an obsession as he slaved away trying to create each dish the way in was prepared in the restaurant.

At times Hemberger recounted feeling inadequate and he pointed to one recipe involving a gel swirl that kept falling apart try after try. 

To make the dish work he felt as though he 'cheated' by having to add more gel in order to get it to hold.

Hemberger emailed chef Grant Achatz with a question about the dish who then kindly invited him to fly to Chicago for a demo on how to make the challenging swirl.

The two bonded in the kitchen and when the gel was finally done it fell apart just like it had for Hemberger at home.

Making magic: While Allen Hemberger's kitchen isn't quite like the one at the world class restaurant, he still had an impressive go at recreating each and every dish Alinea has to offer 

The inspiration: Allen Hemberger is pictured here with chef Grant Achatz, the visionary creator behind Alinea 

Even chefs make mistakes: Allen Hemberger recounts trying to get gel to stick together like the recipe says but then later learning the the recipe was wrong and his intuition was right 

Molecular gastronomy: Some of the food preparation looks more like it's being done in a lab than in a kitchen 

'The recipe might be wrong,' said Achatz who recommended adding at little more gel.

At that moment Hemberger made the realization that he was capable of taking ownership over each dish without having to worry about making it to its absolute perfection. His process and intuition became the evolution, not just the dish itself.

The short documentary also explores the relationship that Allen Hemberger has with his wife Sarah who describes herself as a picky eater.

Even though the cooking process took up most of her husband's time and she didn't like the texture of some of the foods she was supportive of him and their relationship blossomed as beautifully as one of Achatz's dishes.

Sarah is a part of the creative process and helped her husband with the book entitled, 'The Alinea project.'

Allen Hemberger started a Kickstarter for the book so he could tell his life changing story of recreating each plate and learning some invaluable lessons along the way.

The kickstarter originally had a $28,500 goal but he's managed to raise $42,000 in dough thus far.

Surprise after surprise: Diners at Alinea should prepare themselves for the delightful unknown 

Unique: Each dish is a combination of flavors and complex ingredients melded together in scientific perfection 

Love: Not only does Allen Hemberger love recreating food, he loves serving it to his supportive wife Sarah who has helped him through the process of actualizing his passions
