A woman spoke of her shock after she gave birth to a baby daughter on Boxing Day - despite no signs that she was pregnant.

Mhairi Murdoch, 29, spent Christmas suffering from an upset stomach and feeling bloated - but she had no idea it was because she was about to give birth.

She went for a glass of orange juice before bed late on December 26 when a sharp pain in her stomach brought her to her knees.

After the unexpected arrival, which took place around 11.50pm, Mhairi was taken to hospital where she and Russell were given the good news that little Casey was fit and healthy

Hearing her scream, terrified husband Russell, 33, quickly ran to help - as Mhairi realised she was about to have a baby on the kitchen floor.

Just 10 minutes later Russell delivered Casey, a healthy 7lbs 6oz - and completely unexpected - addition to the family.

Mhairi said yesterday: 'It’s the biggest Christmas surprise we’ve ever had.

'In the morning I had a bit of an iffy stomach and wasn’t feeling too great.

'I thought I would have some orange juice before I settled down in my bed.

'All of a sudden I got this searing pain right through my stomach.

Mhairi says that she had no signs of pregnancy until she went into labour

'Before I knew it I was on the kitchen floor.

'Russell heard me screaming in pain from the top of the stairs.

'He came running down and basically found me on all fours on the floor.

'I was getting this very big urge to push - I thought there’s something not right here.

'At that point I just screamed at him ‘I think I’m having a baby’.

'The colour just drained from his face.'

Mhairi, from Aberdeen, had no idea until that point that she was pregnant and had not experienced any of the usual symptoms over the previous nine months.

She had even taken precautions such as getting the contraceptive injection.

She said: 'I’d had regular periods and I was still getting the contraceptive needle.

'I hadn’t put on any weight as such - I was still getting into my normal clothes.

'All I had was a slight bloating - there was no movement or any indication.

'Everything just seemed normal.'

But, having given birth to three other children -- Callum, 12, Caitlin, seven, and John, 22 months - she quickly realised what was happening.

Russell and son Callum rushed to the aid of Mhairi with towels and helped her through a difficult but speedy breech birth.

Mhairi said: 'They did a cracking job - I’m very proud of both of them. It was very quick.

'A lot of people have said that’s the way to do it - but it’s nice to have the warning beforehand.'

After the unexpected arrival, which took place around 11.50pm, Mhairi was taken to hospital where she and Russell were given the good news that little Casey was fit and healthy.

The doctors said that Mhairi had probably not felt any movement during the pregnancy due to the baby being in the breech position.

The surprised mother and her new daughter were allowed home from Aberdeen Maternity Hospital on Sunday night.

Their stunned family and friends grouped together to help out with catching up on the lost months of preparation.

They rushed out in the Boxing Day sales to pick up essential items for the newborn.

Mhairi said: 'All our family and friends have been rallying round and getting us everything.

'It’s been chaos for everyone but they managed to pull it off.

'Now that we are over the shock it’s great.

'We wouldn’t change it for the world but it’s definitely not an experience we would want to ever go through again.'
