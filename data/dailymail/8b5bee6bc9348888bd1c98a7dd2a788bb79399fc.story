Luis Suarez wishes he had come through Barcelona's famed youth academy alongside the likes of Lionel Messi and Andres Iniesta.

The former Liverpool hero is still waiting to make his debut for his new side due to his ban for biting, so has had plenty of time to look around the facilities.

And nothing has impressed Suarez more than the legendary La Masia youth academy, which nurtured young stars like Messi, Xavi and Iniesta.

'I'm impressed and amazed by the facilities,' Suarez told Barca's official magazine.

'The space has to protect the kids, in their schedules, in their study and in their diet.

'I was surprised by everything, especially the way they take care of the kids they have. I wish I had the opportunity to form this way.' 

The controversial forward could make his debut for his new club against rivals Real Madrid at the end of October.

Luis Enrique's side are currently top of La Liga, two points ahead of Valencia and four ahead of Champions League winners Real Madrid. The Catalan giants may have struggled for consistency while playing in Europe this season but are unbeaten in their domestic league.
