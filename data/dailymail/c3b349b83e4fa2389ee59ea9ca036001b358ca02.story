Bournemouth FC players happened upon a surprise after checking into their hotel to find out the infamous Chuckle Brothers were also staying there.

The  comedy double act, whose real names are Barry and Paul Elliot, may be best known for their appearances on children's TV programmes - but it would seem they are also a hit with fully grown football players.

Practically the entire side posed with the pair for a picture that former Republic of Ireland international Ian Harte posted on Twitter with the caption: 'Look who is in our hotel!!! Chuckle brothers To you to me ....'

The Chuckle Brothers were stars of children's television renowned for catchphrases like 'To me to you'

The Cherries are currently riding high at the moment, having risen to second place in the Sky Bet Championship following their exciting 3-2 over Brighton and Hove Albion at the weekend. 

Substitute Yann Kermorgant fired them to their fifth league win on the spin after Lewis Dunk had fouled Callum Wilson in the box in the 75th minute.

Bournemouth are also through to the quarter-finals of the Capital One Cup at the expense of Premier League side West Brom after Wilson scored a dramatic late winner at Dean Court.
