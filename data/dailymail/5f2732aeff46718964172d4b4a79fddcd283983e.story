Andy Murray has found it increasingly hard to defeat Novak Djokovic of late, and now the British number one's wannabe compatriot is going to give it a try.

Aljaz Bedene is the 25-year-old Slovenian settled in Welwyn Garden City with a pop star girlfriend who is a protégé of the renowned music producer and tennis nut Jeff Wayne.

The fast-rising world No 116 hopes to receive his passport and represent Great Britain this year, but for now must concentrate on his first round against the world No 1 and outright favourite for the Australian Open.

The season's first Grand Slam was due to begin on Monday morning, with Murray beginning his campaign against Indian qualifier Yuki Bhambri. James Ward, Kyle Edmund and Heather Watson play on day two, and then there is Bedene.

Since 2008 he has lived in an area more associated with producing outstanding golfers, such as Sir Nick Faldo and Ian Poulter, and he now sees himself as part of the Hertfordshire scene.

He has even represented the county at tennis, under the non-playing captaincy of Wayne – best-known for his War of the Worlds musical adaptation – who works with Bedene's girlfriend Kimalie, another who seeks British citizenship.

At present the player is not known much beyond the tennis cognoscenti, although he is reckoned to have top 50 potential and his ranking is falsely low due to injury problems sustained last year.

His profile would skyrocket with an upset of Djokovic, who might be more vulnerable than usual as he has been battling a virus and has had his preparations for this event disrupted.

Bedene – an athletic baseliner who has already been in the world's top 75 - has had an immigration lawyer pressing for a passport for two years, but is trying to ignore any distractions as he prepares to face the formidable Serb.

'I haven't been checking up on it too much here because I need to focus,' he said on Sunday. 'I really want to play for Great Britain, that's my life goal actually. I don't know everything about it but it looks good so far and I'm looking forward to the next few years.

'I'm paying taxes in England so that's a plus, I guess. I live with my fiancee. I have a friend as well, Jeff Wayne, who is trying to help Kimalie, which is her artist's name in her music career.

'So we have both been based there for our careers and I think that's a big thing. We are both enjoying it there. I'm planning to live there after my career as well. It's just a nice place to live.'

He confirmed that he would try to appeal against a new rule that came into effect this month preventing players who have already represented another country switching their allegiance in the Davis Cup.

His problem is that he has been on the Slovenian team three times, the last occasion being three years ago. The potential objections from someone like long standing Davis Cup stalwart James Ward would be understandable on that basis.
