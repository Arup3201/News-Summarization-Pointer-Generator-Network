A pub was forced to kick out regulars in the middle of the day after it went into administration.

Drinkers in the Goodridge in Burton-on-Trent, Staffordshire, were left stunned after they were told to leave.

Bar staff refused to serve any more drinks during lunchtime and the doors were locked behind them.

Pub: The Goodridge had to stop pulling pints when it went into administration

A sign in the window of the popular venue said the owner, Bramwell Pub Company Limited, had gone into administration, the Burton Mail reports.

One drinker, who asked not to be named, told the local paper: 'I went up to pay for a drink and the staff said that I could not have one, because they had been told to close up as they had gone into administration.

'People were still trying to get in when staff told them they could not go in, and slammed the doors shut.'

MailOnline was unable to contact administrators Zolfo Cooper today but the administrators are reportedly 'inviting parties wishing to make an expression of interest’ in the site to come forward. It is not known how many jobs could be at risk following the sudden closure.

The Bramwell pub chain went into administration last week after it was reported it has £160 million debt.

Peter
 Saville, Kevin Coatest and Anne O'Keefe were appointed as joint 
administrators after the company experienced 'cash flow problems'.

The group operates 185 pubs and bars across the UK and employs around 3,300 staff across all sites.
