A father who had three fingers ripped off in a road accident is keen to get back on his motorbike after having his digits replaced by his toes.

Bike racer Jonas Barber, 31, underwent a 12-hour operation 
where two of his toes were removed to compensate for the fingers he lost on his right hand.

The father-of-three from Leeds will soon undergo
another operation to remove scar tissue but said he was delighted to get his grip back.

You've got to hand it to him: Jonas Barber lost three fingers on his right hand. He had his middle and ring finger replaced using the toe next to his big toe from each foot

Best foot forward: Mr Barber still has good foot function despite having the digit from next to each big toe removed

He said: 'I was willing to do anything to get back on the bike. But it has also meant I can do all kinds of day-to-day things like hold a laptop or grab a pint.

'They aren't the prettiest of things but I don't really care. All that matters is that I have some function back.'

The auto-electrics expert, who runs his own business, was injured during a race in Lincolnshire in July 2011. He was clipped by another rider travelling around 80mph and his fingers got caught in the brake disc of his bike.

The hardy racer said he calmly picked up his fingers off the track and waited for help.

'The marshal came and nearly fainted looking at my hand,' he said.

'There wasn't much pain. I was more in discomfort from a dislocated shoulder.'

Doctors attempted to reattach his index finger in hospital, but had to remove it again after it refused to take even with treatment with leeches.

Then that November he was told about a possible toe transplant and he went under the knife at the Spire Hospital in March 2012.

Mr Barber said: 'To start with their wasn't
much pain but as the recovery goes on the more the nerves knit and the 
more pain you get because you are getting more sensation.

'When
the bandages come off you still recognise them as your toes and they 
are never really going to look like your fingers, although a lot of 
people do comment how well it looks.

'I'm still self-conscious with it but we have done it for function, that's the main objective.'

A toe transplant is a potential treatment for someone who has a number of fingers missing.

The most commonly transplanted toe is the second toe as it is the longest and has joints, a nail, sensitive pulp tissue and a reliable blood supply.

The foot is repaired  by closing the gap between the third and the big toe, leaving a scar.

One second toe can be taken from each foot with very little effect on the function and appearance of it.

When each toe is transferred its blood vessels must be successfully joined to similar vessels in the hand for it to survive. This part of the operation is performed under an operating microscope.

Tendons (to allow movement where required) and nerves (to allow feeling) and the bone must also be rejoined to their counterparts in the hand.

The bone is usually held together with fine pins while it heals. These are usually withdrawn 3-6 weeks after the op.

After the transplant the arm is immobilised with a plaster splint. This is left for three weeks before the dressing is changed.

Feeling gradually returns to the nerves over around 12 weeks, often creating a pins-and-needles sensation.

After this the splint can be worn less and less. Stretches help the joints to recover.

He added that his wife Carla and three daughters Amelia, eight, Madison, six and Freya, four, were all happy with his new hand.

'Now
with the new fingers I can hold a pint glass properly, which is great. 
Little things like that are taken for granted but I can enjoy a drink, 
hold a laptop without dropping it, hold a bottle,' he said.

'My
feet were fine as well. It wasn't just the toe but they cut into the 
foot they needed skin for my hand. The feet been narrowed in effect.

'Racing is a real passion for me and now with the transplant that is the goal. I would like to be track daying by the start of next year.'

He was treated by Prof Simon Kay, who carried out the UK's first hand transplant on Mark Cahill in December.

Prof
Kay, seen as a pioneer in his field, used the toe next to the big toe 
from each of Jonas' feet, providing him with large enough digit 
substitutes without causing him problems with balance.

The professor usually carries out the procedure on babies and very young children and says adult patients are very rare. He said: 'People think that if you're operating on youngsters it's more tricky because they're small.  But it's not, if anything it's more difficult working with the size of an adult's body.'

In the case of Jonas he was a great patient because he has the right personality - he doesn't want to be dramatic or make a big fuss, he just wants to sort himself out and get on with his life.The procedure involves re-attaching the bone, nerves, arteries, tendons, ligaments and skin of the toe to the hand.

However, Prof Kay said: 'It wasn't really complicated surgery. For me and my amazing team, it was relatively straight-forward. 

'The operation gives you some feeling, some movement, some power. We aren't trying to create something beautiful, we're trying to create something functional.'

Mr Barber said his children were particularly relieved by the outcome.

'When I first had the accident we 
initially told my youngest daughter my fingers would grow back,' he said.

'Since 
I've had the toes sewn onto my hand she thinks that's exactly what 
happened - and we aren't about to tell her any different.'
