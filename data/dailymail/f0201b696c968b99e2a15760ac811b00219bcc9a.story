A baby boy born with a rare condition causing parts of his skull to fuse required a four-hour lifesaving operation to reshape and replace parts of the bone, to allow his brain to grow.

Alex Shoebridge was devastated when at a 32-week scan she was told her unborn child had the rare condition craniosynostosis.

The condition caused sections of her son Saul's developing skull to fuse together.

At nine months old he was taken into the operating theatre to undergo a four-hour procedure to put his skull back together.

Saul Shoebridge was born with the rare condition craniosynostosis, which causes parts of the skull to fuse. Where the bone fuses it prevents growth, causing other parts of the skull to 'overgrow' to compensate and allow the brain to grow

At nine months old surgeons told Saul's mother Alex Shoebridge her son would require risky surgery to correct the condition, reshaping and replacing parts of the affected bone

The condition, which affects around one in every 3,000 children, had caused Saul's head to grow irregularly. Ms Shoebridge discovered her unborn son was suffering the condition at a 32-week scan scheduled because she was suffering preeclampsia - a potentially life-threatening condition

Ms Shoebridge, of Banchory, Aberdeenshire said: 'The fusing meant Saul's skull couldn't grow out sideways, only forwards. As a result he was developing quite an abnormally-shaped head.

'It meant his development was severely restricted in the first months.

'There was no choice but to let surgeons correct the problem. The operation wasn't free of risk - I was so nervous during the procedure that I couldn't think straight.'

The trained midwife was told of her unborn son's condition after a 32-week scan, booked because the 42-year-old was suffering preeclampsia - a potentially life-threatening condition affecting pregnant women, caused by raised blood pressure that can lead to severe fits if untreated.

She said: 'I was told one of Saul's cranial sutures - the breaks between the sections of his skull bone - had fused prematurely.

'He was the first baby from my area to have been born with it in seven years.

'Normally sutures are able to mould fairly easily as the baby is delivered from the birth canal and to help development, but for some reason, one of Saul's sutures had healed over.

'The fusing meant Saul's skull couldn't grow out sideways, only forwards. As a result he was developing quite an abnormally-shaped head'

'It was a serious concern because the brain needs room to grow.'

Saul, whose older brother Jordan is 17, was born weighing 5lb 9oz on November 3, 2011.

Ms
 Shoebridge said: 'My first words when Saul came out were, "my, you've 
got a big head, haven't you?" His body was quite small but his head was 
large.

'I made sure he was 
wearing a hat when Jordan came in to see him. I didn't want the first 
thing Jordan noticed about his brother was how different he was.

Ms Shoebridge, a trained midwife, said: 'The fusing meant Saul's skull couldn't grow out sideways, only forwards. As a result he was developing quite an abnormally-shaped head'

Now two, Saul made a quick recovery from his operation, trying to sit up on his own for the first time just three days after the treatment

Crainosynotosis is a rare condition which causes a baby to be born with an abnormally shaped skull.

A child's irregularly shaped head can cause headaches, learning difficulties and eye problems.

Most symptoms develop later in childhood and usually result from increased pressure within the skull.

The
 condition is usually diagnosed after a doctor conducts a visual 
examination of the skull, although further tests may be necessary.Why does it happen?Craniosynostosis is the result of premature fusion of different secions of the skull.

It means the skull is unable to grown in affected areas. As
 one area of the skull is restricted, other parts of a baby's head 
'overgrow' to compensate and limit the pressure developing around the 
brain.

The lack of growth in some areas and compensatory growth in others, often leads to a altered head shape.How common is the condition? Craniosynostosis is rare, affecting around one in every 1,800 to 3,000 children, according to NHS Choices.

Three of every four cases affects boys.Treating craniosynostosis The primary treatment for the condition is surgery.

The procedure can be carried out during the first year of your baby's life, or delayed until later in childhood.

Most children recover well from the operation and the appearance of their skill improves significantly.

However,
 around one if 15 children may have on-going problems with their skull's
 development as they get older. In these cases, often the child will 
need further surgery to correct changes as they age.

'Saul was extremely slow to develop in the first few months while we awaited the date of the operation. He couldn't even sit up, because his neck muscles were too weak to support his head.

'I'd joined a Facebook group of mothers who were all expecting in the same month and it was upsetting to realise all their children were reaching milestones which Saul was nowhere near.'

Surgeons at the Royal Hospital for Sick Children in Yorkhill, Glasgow, told Ms Shoebridge her tiny son required an operation to remove sections of his skull allowing them to reshape and replace the affected pieces of bone.

They warned the mother-of-two her youngest child could suffer brain damage as a result of the treatment.

She said: 'I was extremely nervous because the surgery was not without risk.

'I learned that in other hospitals some children had not survived, although it's extremely rare for that to happen.

'If bleeding starts, it difficult to stop. The consequences can be severe.

'We didn't have much of an option. If we left it any longer, then his brain would become severely restricted.

'Nevertheless, I made two return trips to hospital to talk to the surgeons before making my mind up. It turned out the surgeons were absolutely fantastic.'

During the four-hour operation Saul did experience some bleeding and required an urgent blood transfusion.

Ms Shoebridge said: 'I tried to keep my mind occupied while Saul was in theatre.

'After a while I went back up to the 
ward to see if there were any developments.

'When I got there I noticed 
that his cot had been taken away. I thought, "my God, what's happened?"

'It
 turned out that the surgeons had simply requested for Saul's cot to be 
taken to the operating theatre so he could be placed in it.'

Saul made a quick recovery, attempting to sit up by himself for the first time three days after surgery.

Ms Shoebrdige praised the 'fantastic' surgeons at the Royal Hospital for Sick Children in Yorkhill, Glasgow for saving Saul, pictured shortly after he was born in November 2011

The
 now two-year-old has since been diagnosed with a chromosomal deletion 
disorder and developmental challenges which affects his ability to learn
 to walk and crawl, and his sensory perception.

Ms Shoebridge said: 'He's two-and-a-half now and he's only just started to walk, so he's got some way to catch up. His development only truly began after he had the surgery.

'He's a great little boy. He's extremely cheeky and laughs a lot, but he can be a monster too - a normal two year old, in other words.

'He's got a lot of challenges but he's doing well. I feel very supported.

'The consultants were amazing at the time of the surgery and I've got lots of specialists - speech therapists, physiotherapists and health visitors within reach.'

Ms Shoebridge has found a network of support among other parents at the Facebook group of Headlines, a charity supporting families with craniofacial conditions in the UK and overseas.

She said: 'When you're a parent facing these conditions it's easy to feel alone, but the truth is there are thousands of families out there who know what you're going through.'
