Amanda Knox's much anticipated tell-all memoir of the four years she spent in an Italian jail for the murder of British student Meredith Kercher will be published on April 30th next year according to publisher HarperCollins.

Titled 'Waiting to be Heard', the book will allow the 25-year-old the opportunity to give her version of the story which made international headlines on both sides of the Atlantic and which she reportedly received $4 million for.

Acquitted of the brutal 2007 murder of Kercher along with her then-boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito in 2011, Knox is pictured on the front cover in an intense, unsmiling pose which was taken earlier this year.

The murder made headlines around the world and the pair were famously photographed kissing and cuddling outside the scene of the crime - and in the ensuing trial Knox was portrayed as man-hungry earning her the moniker 'Foxy Knoxy'.

The book deal was announced in February of last year after months of intense negotiations and battling between 20 publishers, eager to sign up the former language student to tell of her ordeal in the Italian justice system.

At the time, the deal was said to distress the family of Meredith Kercher, the British student who lived with Knox in Perugia and who was found in a pool of blood on their apartment floor on November 2nd 2007.

Knox, who was convicted along with Sollecito of the sexual assault and murder of Kercher spent four years inside Italian prisons before her acquittal and release in October last year.

Over the course of those four years, her family is estimated to have spent more than $1 million in legal, travel and living costs to be at her side during the murder trial and her appeal.

Amanda's parents, Edda Mellas and Curt Know, who divorced when she was two, even took out second mortagages to pay for their daughters lawyers and ultimately successful acquittal.

According to HarperCollins, 'Knox will give a full and unflinching account of the events that led to her arrest in Perugia,' said a spokesman for the publishing giant.

The same spokesman added that Knox will speak about her 'struggles with the complexities of the Italian judicial system' and will include excerpts from journals that she kept in prison.

‘Knox will talk about her harrowing experience at the hands of the Italian police and later prison guards and inmates,’ said the spokesman.

HarperCollins is promising she will ‘reveal never before-told details surrounding her case’ about ‘the most challenging time of her young life’.

The mammoth payday for Knox was negotiated by Washington attorney Robert Barnett, who has worked for President Barack Obama and former President George W. Bush.

Some 20 publishers were interested in the book and Knox met with seven, all of whom submitted bids during the auction that Knox's representatives held.

HarperCollins publisher Jonathan Burnham said that Knox, who also studied creative writing, would work with a collaborator.

The company should be able to recoup some of its investment by selling TV interview rights on the back of the book.

Broadcasters are banned from paying for interviews but they routinely get around it by buying the rights to the interviewee’s book instead.

Her editor will be Claire Wachtel, whose other authors have included crime novelist Dennis Lehane and journalist Cokie Roberts.

Publishers in recent years have shied from controversial defendants, especially since the fiasco of O.J. Simpson's ‘If I Did It’.

That was a fictionalised account of Nicole Brown Simpson's murder that was cancelled in 2006 by HarperCollins in response to public outrage.

After Casey Anthony was cleared last year of killing her two-year-old daughter, several publishers said they would not consider a book by her.

‘I think it’s a huge gamble for somebody,’ a publisher who had no intention of bidding on the story told the New York Times earlier this month.

‘It’s not like she has been exonerated in a clear and definitive way.’

'Waiting to be Heard' will come out two months later than originally scheduled.

The date was changed out of deference to a court in Italy that scheduled a March 25th hearing for the prosecution's appeal of the former exchange student's acquittal in the 2007 murder of her British roommate.

Italian prosecutor Giovanni Galati has said he is ‘very convinced’ that Sollecito and Knox were responsible for Miss Kercher's death in November 2007.

But the Italian appeals court in October said the guilty verdicts against the pair were not corroborated by any evidence.

It added that the court hadn't proven they were in the house when Miss Kercher was killed.

A third defendant, Ivory Coast-born drifter Rudy Guede, was convicted in a separate trial of sexually assaulting and stabbing Miss Kercher.

His 16-year sentence, reduced in appeal from an initial 30 years, was upheld by Italy's highest court in 2010.

In September, Raffaele Sollecito released his own book in which he detailed how he had sex with former girlfriend Amanda Knox the first night they met.

Italian Sollecito, 28, was convicted alongside Knox in 2009 of killing Miss Kercher, but the pair were freed last October after their convictions were overturned due to a lack of evidence.

In Honour Bound: My Journey To Hell And Back With Amanda Knox, the bespectacled computer studies graduate reveals his true feelings for the 25-year-old blonde American, who he met just a week before tragic Meredith was found semi naked and with her throat slashed in the bedroom of her house.

He also describes the moment he met Knox again for the first time after they were sensationally cleared of the murder last year due to a lack of evidence - after spending four years in jail and being convicted in 2009.

Sollecito said: 'I wasn't just nervous about setting eyes on her again. I felt I was suffering from some sort of associative disorder, in which it became difficult for me to focus on my genuine and continuing fondness for Amanda without being overwhelmed by an instinctive, involuntary revulsion at everything the courts and the media had thrown at her.

'Two different Amandas - the real one, and the distorted, she-devil version I had read about and seen on television nonstop for four years seemed somehow blurred in my unconscious mind.'

Knox and Sollecito were held by police just five days after the 2007 murder because of their odd behaviour - initially they could not remember clearly what they were doing as they had been smoking marijuana the night of the killing and detectives watched in amazement as the pair kissed and cuddled in front of Meredith's grief stricken friends while they waited to be interviewed.

Knox performed cartwheels in the police station and sat on Sollecito's lap - and they were also later filmed buying lingerie, the American promising her boyfriend she would wear it later while they had 'wild sex.'

In his book Sollecito admits their behaviour was 'odd' but at the same time he hits out at the sloppy police investigation which was so crucial in clearing them after experts revealed at the appeal evidence was unreliable as it had been poorly handled and was contaminated.

He admitted they also had no real alibi as the couple were smoking marijuana the night of the murder and they only had 'each other' to explain what they were doing the night of the killing.

And in April, John Kercher, the father of Meredith said that the media's attention was all on Amanda Knox and not his daughter, the real victim

'The media’s glare throughout the trial and appeal process has been fixed almost entirely on Amanda Knox. Books have been written about her and there has even been a television film focusing on her. It has seemed as if Meredith has been all but forgotten.'

Since November last year, Knox has been dating James Terrano and the couple were reported to still be going strong together this fall.
