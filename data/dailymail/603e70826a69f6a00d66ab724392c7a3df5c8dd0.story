Learning lines from Shakespeare need not be boring after a father found a way to help his daughter learn a monologue from As You Like It.

Iain Anderson, from Brisbane, Australia, filmed his daughter Hazel saying a line from the play in different locations over the course of 18 months.

The two-and-a-half minute video opens with the famous line 'All the world's a stage' as Hazel plays on a roundabout. 

The camera then flicks to Hazel playing tabletop game Hungry Hungry Hippos as she declares: 'And all the men and women merely players.'

Further scenes show Hazel in a location relevant to the line she is speaking. She holds open a door and says earnestly: 'They have their exits and their entrances.'

Other shots feature Hazel in a variety of location from the middle of the sea to the school run. 

Hazel, who is a fan of literature, will have no trouble remembering the bard's lines as she will be able to link each place to a quote from the play.
