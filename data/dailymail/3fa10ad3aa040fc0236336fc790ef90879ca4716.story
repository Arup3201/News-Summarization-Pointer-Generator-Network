An Australian lawn bowls player attempted to escape Glasgow's infamous weather in the confines of a box meant for players' bags.

Kelvin Kerkow was spotted by TV Cameras spilling out of the container with the lid resting on his head.

The 45-year-old took most of the attention away from England's Commonwealth Games lawn bowls match against Scotland, which was taking place at the time.

Having enjoyed sunny skies with temperatures in the high twenties last week, yesterday Glasgow was once again raining and with the temperature failing to rise out of the teens.

This was a stark contrast to Mr Kerkow’s home in Australia where Darwin is set for 'winter' temperatures to reach up to 35 degrees, and even Sydney expected to be in the high twenties.

The Australian lawn bowls team’s coach, Steve Glasson, posted a picture to his Twitter page and said: 'Look at this clown will you. Kelvin Kerkow in the bag box as the rain comes down.'

Viewers watching the match on television were also quick to grab a picture of Mr Kerkow and post them on social media.
