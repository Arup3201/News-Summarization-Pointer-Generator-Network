A New Jersey man has been accused of distributing thousands of child pornography images including pictures of pre-pubescant girls being bound threatened with knives.

Thomas Ballard, 37, was arrested on Monday after officers swooped on his home in Egg Harbor Township with a search warrant.

After searching his home and truck, investigators seized two personal computers and several cell phones, according to the Attorney General's Office.

Child porn charges: Thomas Ballard, 37, has been accused of distributing thousands of images including pictures of pre-pubescant girls being bound threatened with knives

Ballard is charged with distributing and possessing child porn and tampering with evidence.

He remained jailed Tuesday on $100,000 bail, and it was not known if he has retained a lawyer.

Between October 2013 and March 2014, Ballard allegedly distributed more than 3,000 files depicting sexual exploitation of children.

He first came to the attention of authorities in 2010 after allegedly posting comments on a website known to be frequented by those interested in child porn images.

He allegedly posted one message on the site saying he 'trades privately.' Police said this suggests he was offering to trade images via email.

Several files show prepubescent girls being bound and tortured with knives pointed at them.

Ballard could face nearly 17 years if convicted on all counts.
