The land mass of the United States is so vast, the whole of the UK could fit inside it more than 40 times over.

While Russia, with the largest land mass of any country, is 8.5 million times bigger than one of the smallest, Monaco. 

These figures are taken from the global comparison site MyLifeElsewhere which aims to show people how their lives would be different if they moved to another country.

MyLifeElsewhere collects statistical data points taken from the CIA Factbook, Google Maps and other public sources. Its Compare Country Statistics tool compares the land mass of countries, and shows how the two nations would appear if they were laid over the top of one another. For example, the UK is approximately 40 times smaller than the US, and would fit inside Wyoming and Colorado

MyLifeElsewhere collects statistical data points taken from the CIA Factbook, Google Maps and other public sources, and uses this data to offer up interesting comparisons between countries.

It has three tools called Compare Country Statistics, Country Size Comparison Tool and Worldwide Etiquette.

The first compares the land mass of different countries, and shows how the two nations would appear if they were laid over the top of one another. 

For example, the UK covers approximately 94, 058 square miles (243,610 square km), while the US is approximately 3,794,100 square miles (9,826,675 square km). 

This means the majority of Britain could fit inside the states Wyoming and Colorado.

At the other end of the scale, Russia covers 8,549,121 million times more land than Monaco. The countries measure 6,601,668 square miles (17,098,242 square km) and 0.07 square miles (2 square km) respectively. In fact, Monaco is so small, that when placed over a map of Russia (pictured left) it almost disappears as the map zooms outs (pictured right as a small black dot)

Meanwhile, the US and Australia are much closer in size (pictured). Australia is approximately 2,988,901 square miles (7,741,220 square km), compared to the size of the US, which measures approximately 3,794,100 square miles (9,826,675 square km)

At the other end of the scale, Russia covers 8,549,121 million times more land than Monaco - measuring 6,601,668 square miles (17,098,242 square km) and 0.07 square miles (2 square km) respectively. 

Monaco is so small, when placed over a map of Russia, that zooming out too far makes it disappear.

Meanwhile, the US and Australia are much closer in size.   

The MyLifeElsewhere tool also compares the economy and life expectancy of different countries. For example, people in the US make 41.6% more than in the UK, but are three times more likely to have AIDS, 39 per cent more likely to die in infancy, and have 9.8 per cent more babies

The Etiquette tool also helps visitors to other countries learn about local customs. For America, the tool explains that a standard greeting at dinner is cheers. Table manners in the US are informal, but people should refrain from putting their elbows on the table. At a bar, drinks cost around $1 to $3, and restaurants usually expect a tip of around 15 to 20 per cent

Australia is approximately 2,988,901 square miles (7,741,220 square km), compared to the US' 3,794,100 square miles (9,826,675 square km). 

But in Japan, Campa means cheers. Diners should also keep their bowl close to their mouth when eating soup, and should never get drunk while dining.

The tool also advises against displaying a middle finger by itself, and invading the personal space of others. 

But in Japan, Campa means cheers. Diners should also keep their bowl close to their mouth when eating soup, and should never get drunk while dining. 

Tipping can sometimes be considered an insult in Japan, and people shouldn't pour soy sauce over steamed rice, use chopsticks to point at something, and show always bow when greeting a new person. 

'Have you ever wondered how your life would be if you were born in a different country?,' explains the site. 

'Our goal is to help answer this question. MyLifeElsewhere is a site that is first of its kind, containing interesting data and statistics that you cannot find anywhere else on the web. 

'By showing you country statistics relative to your home country, you are able to more fully visualise your home country in comparison to others.' 

London-based company The Eco Experts has revealed the countries best-equipped to cope with climate change on a map (shown). Scandinavian countries like Norway and Finland, and also the UK, score highly. Green is best, scaling down to red being worst

Climate change experts have released a map of the world revealing how prepared different countries are to cope with the effects of climate change (shown above).

In the map 192 countries are ranked by their ‘vulnerability’ and ‘readiness’, producing an overall score on their fate, ranging from bad (zero) to excellent (100).

The results reveal that Scandinavian countries and the UK are among the most likely to survive - but areas of sub-Saharan Africa will be hardest hit.

The maps were created by London-based company The Eco Experts, using data from the University of Notre Dame in Indiana, known as the ND-Gain Index.

They took into account location, terrain, pollution rates and national resources when calculating which countries would be most affected.

Countries like Norway, Sweden, Finland and Denmark score well on the scale.

But places like Central America, Africa and India all appear at risk from natural disaster - and are poorly equipped to cope, said The Eco Experts.

Jon Whiting, of The Eco Experts warned: ‘Hurricanes, earthquakes, blizzards, droughts and flooding are all real dangers for some of these areas, and this is compounded by a lack of national strategy to counteract the effects.’

Burundi, Chad, Sudan and the Democratic Republic of Congo produced some of the lowest scores, meaning these countries will be the biggest victims of weather disasters.
