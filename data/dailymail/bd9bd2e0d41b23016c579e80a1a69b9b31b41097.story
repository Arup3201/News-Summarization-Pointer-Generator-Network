Rugby league star Darius Boyd has been admitted to a mental health clinic to seek treatment for depression.

Boyd's NRL club, the Newcastle Knights, said there was no timeframe on Boyd's return to football, with their focus purely on the 27-year-old's health.

'We are ensuring Darius gets the best possible care and treatment at this time,' the NRL club's CEO Matt Gidley said in a statement on Wednesday.

It comes after Boyd allegedly trashed a resort hotel room in the NSW Hunter Valley last week, causing $1,500 worth of damage.

'Depression is a serious illness in our society and we are pleased Darius has taken the first step in his recovery by acknowledging he needs help,' Gidley said.

'Football is secondary at this point, it is important Darius' focus is entirely on his treatment.'

Boyd and a female companion, believed to be his wife Kayla, reportedly left behind a smashed television, broken glass and a hole in one of the walls when they checked out of the Chateau Elan in the Hunter Valley, north of Sydney, last Thursday.

The Daily Telegraph reports that the manager of the Hunter Valley resort, Joe Spagnolo, said the the incident had not been reported to authorities after the Newcastle Knights player called to apologise and offered to pay for the damage.

It's believed Boyd was given a few days off following the State of Origin with Queensland and had booked one night at the resort.

The revelation comes just two days after it was announced that Boyd's coach and career mentor Wayne Bennett was leaving the club to return to the Brisbane Broncos - where they first worked together in 2006.'I donâ€™t know what the two of them were doing and I don't want to know.

As long as he came good with the money to repair it. The bill came to $1,500 and he's paid it so that's where it's been left,' Mr Spagnolo said.

He said the pair had spa treatments on Wednesday and believed the damage could have happened later that night.

'It's disappointing but I've seen a lot worse. We've had the CEOs of banks driving cars on to the golf course and doing doughnuts and causing all sorts of damage,' Mr Spagnolo said.

The resort's general manager Joe Spagnolo said the incident had not been reported to authorities because Boyd rang to apologise and offered to pay for the damage

'We get a lot of footballers come in and nine times out of 10, there are no problems.'

Knights CEO Matt Gidley said he was not aware of the incident involving Boyd and damage caused to the hotel room.

Boyd has been in the headlines since Queensland's State of Origin series loss, with rampant speculation about Bennett's future prior to Monday's announcement.

The fullback was immediately linked to Bennett's movement because he's played under the coach his entire career - following him from Brisbane to St George Illawarra, then to Newcastle.

Boyd is now tipped to follow his coach yet again back to the Broncos next season.
