A Falklands veteran with terminal lung cancer has been told to report back to a Government work programme 'when he's feeling better'. 

Amputee Gordon Lang, 62, from Gosport, Hampshire, said he was shocked to receive a letter from the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) urging him to find a ‘suitable job’ after he claims he told them he was dying.

Until 2012, the ex Royal Marine worked as a steward at HMS Sultan, before losing his leg through illness - forcing him onto Employment and Support Allowance.

Amputee Gordon Lang, 62, from Gosport, Hampshire, said he was shocked to receive a letter from the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) urging him to find a ‘suitable job’ after he told them he was dying

But earlier this year, his £600 benefits were cancelled  when he was assessed by Atos, the Government-appointed private company behind fitness-to-work tests, and told he could return to employment.

The divorcee father -of-one, who was on RFA Sir Galahad when she was hit in the Falklands and also served in Northern Ireland, was in the process of appealing that decision at tribunal when his lung cancer was discovered.

He claims he then told the government work programme - run by the Shaw Trust charity - about his cancer diagnosis, only to receive a response saying: ‘When you feel fit and ready for work we look forward to working with you to find a suitable job.’

Shaw Trust insist they were not told how serious Mr Lang’s illness was prior to sending the letter, and the war veteran has since been put back on Employment and Support Allowance.

But Mr Lang, who has not been told how long he has to live, said: ‘I feel not only betrayed but criminalised for being ill.

‘I’ve been at work since I was 10 years old - that’s 50 years in the work place.

‘If I hadn’t lost my leg I’d still be at work now.

‘I’ve never shirked in my life.’

Shaw Trust in Portsmouth, which administers the work programme, wrote the letter to Mr Lang saying they noted he was not well. 

Mr Lang says that was sent after he gave them a medical note when he first fell ill and told them about his terminal condition.

Richard Dickson, Gosport and Alverstoke branch president of the Royal British Legion, said: ‘It’s a tragedy that those who are there to look after the welfare of our ex-servicemen are totally out of touch.

‘They’re more interested in purse strings than doing what’s right for somebody experiencing great difficulties.

‘I would like to see that somebody has an ounce of humanity in their body to look at exactly what this man needs.’ 

In a statement, Shaw Trust spokesman Joel Charles said: ‘At no point were we advised about the seriousness of Mr Lang’s condition.

‘We wrote to Mr Lang on November 20 to acknowledge that we had received his medical certificate and confirm that he would receive no further contact from Shaw Trust during this period of time.

‘Now that we are aware of all the circumstance, our thoughts are with Mr Lang during this difficult time.’

The not-for-profit firm delivers the work programme for Maximus, which took over from Atos as the DWP’s contractor for work assessments.

A DWP spokesman added: ‘We are hugely grateful to Mr Lang, as we are of everyone who serves our country.’
