Lionel Messi left  Pep Guardiola applauding in the Nou Camp stands, the football world entertained and James Milner on the turf on Wednesday night as he pulled off a stunning nutmeg on the unfortunate Manchester City midfielder.

The Barcelona superstar made a habit of performing the skill during his side's 1-0 Champions League win, mesmerising both the 92,000 crowd and City players including Brazilian Fernandinho.

After Messi's breathtaking display, Sportsmail traces the origins of nutmegging and counts down 10 of the best of all time.

What is a nutmeg? 

A nutmeg is the technique of rolling the ball between an opponent's legs, and gains extra acclaim when the attacking player retains possession after performing the trick.

Where does the word come from? 

The origins of the word have long been debated, with the most popular theory being that nutmegs are slang for a rather private area of the male anatomy — a notion put forward by Countdown star Susie Dent, of Dictionary Corner, who on Wednesday night tweeted: 'Nutmegging in football comes from the centuries-old slang 'nutmegs', meaning 'testicles'. In case Messi is ever interested.'

However, the use of the word nutmeg to mean leg in Cockney rhyming slang has also been put forward as an explanation, while another claim is that it comes from the practice used in nutmeg exports between America and England in the 18th century, when nutmegs were such a valuable commodity that unscrupulous exporters used to mix wooden replicas into the sacks being shipped across the Atlantic.

Being nutmegged soon came to imply stupidity on the part of the duped victim and cleverness on the part of the trickster. It later caught on in football, implying that the player whose legs the ball had been played through had been tricked, or, nutmegged.

The verb nutmegged is listed by the Oxford English Dictionary as 'arising in the 1870s which in Victorian slang came to mean "to be tricked or deceived, especially in a manner which makes the victim look foolish".'

In Spanish a nutmeg is known as 'cano' or 'tunel', while many countries around the world have their own unique words to describe the skill.

Sportsmail's top 10 nutmegs

10. John O'Shea on Luis Figo, Manchester United vs Real Madrid, 2003

That isn't written the wrong way. Honest.

Manchester United's utility man gave the Portuguese superstar a taste of his own medicine with this silky piece of skill in a Champions League quarter-final at Old Trafford almost 12 years ago. 

9. Fernando Redondo on Henning Berg, Manchester United vs Real Madrid, 2000

Another Champions League clash between United and Real, another stunning nutmeg.

Three years before O'Shea's effort Redondo set up the visitors' winning goal for Raul with a sublime flick through the legs of Berg.

8. Lionel Messi on James Milner, Barcelona vs Manchester City, 2015

Messi's brilliant piece of skill - one of many on Wednesday night - is only good enough for eighth place on our countdown.

The fact Milner came rushing in counts against the Argentine, although leaving the England international on his backside earns him extra points.

7. Ronaldinho on Chievo, AC Milan vs Chievo, 2010

Some Brazilian magic from Ronaldinho now, as he toys with a helpless Chievo player in Serie A.

The former Barca man is renowned for his dribbling skills and they can be seen in full flow in the clip below, which includes an audacious backheel nutmeg. 

6. Ryan Giggs on Jason Cundy, Tottenham vs Manchester United, 1992

The first nutmeg on our countdown which ended with the architect scoring.

Giggs pounces on a mistake by Dean Austin, pops the ball through Cundy's legs before rounding goalkeeper Ian Walker to score. Not bad for an 18-year-old.

5. Luis Suarez on Ryan Shotton, Stoke vs Liverpool, 2011

Similar to Giggs' effort in that it ended with a goal, Suarez showed superb vision to knock the ball past Shotton and create some space for himself.

His next touch wasn't bad either, bending his shot into the bottom corner of Thomas Sorensen's net to help Liverpool into the Carling Cup fifth round. 

4. Lionel Messi on Emir Spahic, Sevilla vs Barcelona, 2012

Wednesday night's game against City wasn't the first time Messi has caught the eye with a nutmeg.

The little Argentine showed speed, composure and skill against Sevilla as he put the ball through Spahic's legs before delightfully chipping the ball into the back of the net. 

3. Ricardo Kishna on Stefano Marzo, Ajax vs Heerenveen, 2014

One of Ajax's bright young things, Kishna showed exactly why he's destined for a big future with this outrageous touch late last year.

The 20-year-old's flicked nutmeg left Marzo stranded and Ajax on the attack. Perfection.

2. Cristiano Ronaldo vs Steven Davis, Northern Ireland vs Portugal, 2013

A wonderful piece of skill from Ronaldo who first fools Davis with a Cruyff turn before popping the ball in between the Southampton man's legs.

The Portuguese also gets a whack but the referee plays advantage as he retains possession with a neat backheel to a team-mate.

1. Juan Roman Riquelme on Mario Yepes, Boca Juniors vs River Plate, 2000

One of the most talented players of his generation, Riquelme was no stranger to moments of magic on the pitch.

Even in a heated Copa Libertadores quarter-final he was cool enough to beat Yepes with a brilliant rolled nutmeg. Class.

PS

Touted as the new Neymar, Brazilian youngster Kenedy definitely has the skills to rival his compatriot.

The Fluminense forward pulled off this stunning elastico nutmeg against Argentina Under 20s last month, bamboozling his opponent with his quick feet. No wonder Premier League clubs are keeping an eye on him...
