Middlesbrough boss Aitor Karanka has watched former club Real Madrid smash 13 goals in two games following an early-season stutter – and he fears a similar backlash from Liverpool.

Real were at their scintillating best as they put eight past Deportivo on Saturday having won 5-1 against Basle in midweek. Those victories came on the back of two successive defeats in La Liga which triggered questions over the future of Carlo Ancelotti.

In-form Boro, with three wins on the bounce, travel to Anfield on Tuesday with the Reds having lost their last two in the Premier League.

Middlesbrough boss Aitor Karanka is expecting a very tough evening against Liverpool on Tuesday  

The Spaniard believes Liverpool are due a goal glut after a slow start, like former club Real Madrd

But Karanka warned: ‘I know they aren’t in a good way but they have a good manager and good players.

‘Look at Real Madrid, they were very bad two weeks ago then they score eight goals. They have scored 13 in two games.

‘You cannot know what is, and what is not, a good time to play Liverpool.

‘You have to remember, they are a Champions League team and we are a Championship team. There is a big difference between Liverpool and us.

‘But we must go there to win, you can’t go to enjoy the atmosphere. That is dangerous.’

Spanish striker Kike has been in excellent form for Boro and has five goals from seven starts this season

Karanka - former assistant to Jose Mourinho at the Bernabeu - is set to start with Chelsea loanee Patrick Bamford in attack. The 21-year-old is one of three Blues youngsters allowed to head north this season because of the relationship of the two bosses.

Kike – Karanka looks to have pulled off something of a coup by persuading the silky Spaniard to join the club. The 24-year-old scored 23 times in 46 league games for Murcia and already he has five from seven starts for Boro.

Patrick Bamford – The Chelsea loanee has proved a Football League goal machine following spells at Derby and MK Dons last season. He opened his account for his new club at the weekend and will be out to prove his worth against Premier League opponents.

Grant Leadbitter – The former Sunderland and Ipswich schemer is in frightening form and has plundered seven from midfield this season, including his Roberto Carlos-esque free-kick at Huddersfield. He is the man who makes Boro tick.

And Karanka said: ‘I haven’t spoken to him (Mourinho) yet – but maybe I will ring him at half-time (for some advice).

‘But we know how difficult this will be, no matter what team they play.’

One of the players Karanka could target in Liverpool’s suspect backline is 20-year-old Javi Manquillo, who was hauled off after 22 minutes of the 3-1 defeat at West Ham on Saturday.

The Atletico Madrid loanee played under Karanka with Spain Under-16s and he tried to bring him to Teesside last season.

‘I know him very well as a lad and a player and I tried to convince him to come here but it was not possible,’ he revealed.

‘I think he’s the ideal player for the Premier League. He’s very strong and very good with his feet. He is young and has everything to enjoy success here in England. He will be a very good player in the future.’

Boro enjoyed a 4-0 victory over Brentford on Saturday to put them to within three points of top.

Liverpool, meanwhile, have struggled for goals in the post Luis Suarez era, and Karanka went on: ‘Football is all about goals. Last season we were working very well and were consistent but we went seven games without scoring one goal. Now, touch wood, we have recovered our consistency and have many options to score goals.

‘For Liverpool, losing a player like Suarez will always be a very important miss, because he is one player who scored an unbelievable amount of goals both for Liverpool and his national team. He is a big miss.’

Rickie Lambert, who has been used from the bench so far for Liverpool, will start against Boro

Leadbitter's good form has helped Middlesbrough with their last three games and climb up to 5th 

Steven Gerrard was criticised for his performance on Saturday but Liverpool will hope to bounce back
