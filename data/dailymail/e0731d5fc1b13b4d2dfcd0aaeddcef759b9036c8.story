From his battalion of female guards to his penchant for pitching tents on the lawns of the Élysée Palace, deposed Libyan dictator Colonel Gaddafi was as strange as he was dangerous.

Now the plastic surgeon the despot shared with Italy's Silvio Berlusconi has revealed his bizarre taste for cosmetic enhancement - done without anaesthetic in the early hours of the morning.

'He wanted lipo filling because a desert man gets bad skin and we did the hair implant too,' explained Dr Liacya Ribeiro, a breast augmentation specialist based in Rio de Janeiro.

Surgery: Dr Liacya Ribeiros told the BBC that Gaddafi was fond of late night surgery done without sedation

'The operation was performed with local anesthetic only. No sedation.' He added: 'He [Gaddafi] was afraid that somebody might kill him.'

The Brazilian appears in a new BBC documentary, Mad Dog: Gaddafi's Secret World, which delves into the peculiar lifestyle enjoyed by the late dictator.

It also looks at the darker side of life in Gaddafi's Libya and goes inside the palace where the dictator kept his 'harem' of girls, some as young as 14, and raped them repeatedly.

Many were virgins kidnapped from schools and universities and kept prisoner for years in specially designed secret sex lairs hidden within Tripoli University or his many palaces.

Speaking to the Mail On Sunday, one teacher at a Tripoli school recalled how the girls were all very young.

‘Some were only 14,’ she said. ‘They would simply take the girl they wanted. They had no conscience, no morals, not an iota of mercy even though she was a mere child.’

The teacher also feared for her own daughter who was attending Tripoli University, who had told her mother that the community around the university lived in fear when a visit from the colonel was announced. ‘The girls he wanted would be rounded up and sent to him,’ she said.

‘One just disappeared and they never found her again, despite her father and brothers searching for her.

'Another was found three months later, cut, raped and lying in the middle of a park. She had been left for dead.’

Dr Ribeiro, by contrast, told filmmakers that his memories of Gaddafi are largely good but complained of his insistence on completing procedures in the small hours.

Bodyguards: Many of Gaddafi's famous battalion of female guards had also been abused by the despot

'He was a very nice man, he was a television man,' says the doctor. '[But we would do operations at] 2am in the morning.'

The facilities, however, did please Dr Ribeiro, who carried out the operations on Gaddafi in the tunnels beneath his Tripoli palace.

'It was like a big hospital,' he remembers.'The surgery room in the bunker was very good.'

But while Ribeiro seems unscarred by his encounters with the evil Gaddafi, not everyone was so lucky.

As one former inhabitant of the dictator's harem, who spoke to the BBC, revealed: ‘I will never forget that first time, that moment.

'He  violated my body and pierced my  soul with a dagger. That blade will never come out.’
