Internet trolls who poisonously mock sportsmen behind a screen of anonymity take note - you're not as safe as you think you are.

Ex-footballer turned boxer Curtis Woodhouse was so incensed by the vitriolic comments he received from one Twitter user he offered a cash reward for the man's address and drove to confront him on his doorstep.

The 32-year-old ex-Birmingham City and Hull City centre, who took up boxing at 26, lost his English light welterweight crown to Shayne Singleton on a controversial points decision last week.

He was enraged when he was branded a 'disgrace', a 'waste of s****' and was urged to retire by Sheffield-based user Jimmyob88, so Woodhouse offered £1,000 to anyone who could help him find him.

A Twitter follower supplied him with an address and the sportsman, from Driffield, near Bridlington, kept his 18,000 Twitter followers updated yesterday as he drove 70 miles to 'give him a right pasting'.

'Just on my way to Sheffield to have a little chat with a old friend, get the kettle on', he wrote.

Woodhouse later tweeted a picture of a street sign said to be the road on which the target of his anger lived. 'Right Jimbob im here,' he wrote. 'Someone tell me what number he lives at or do I have to knock on every door #it'sshowtime.'

Realising his perilous plight, Jimmyob88 tried to make amends. 'I am sorry it's getting a bit out of hand,' he tweeted. 'I am in the wrong. I accept that.'

Backtracking frantically, he claimed he thought Woodhouse would take the abuse 'as a joke', calling it a 'bit of harmless fun'.

Woodhouse, unable to find his prey, finally admitted defeat and went home.

'Jimmyob88 never came out to play so I'm going,' he tweeted. 'Maybe a bit daft what I did today but sometimes enough is enough.'

And Woodhouse later appeared to have seen the funny side, writing: "Just found out you can block people. Could have let me know earlier, I could have saved 20 quid in petrol.'

Among many cheering on Woodhouse was footballer Joey Barton, no stranger to abuse on Twitter: 'Brilliant mate. You're my hero. Wish someone had a hidden camera in his room right now.'

Former heavyweight champion Lennox Lewis also applauded Woodhouse for his antics, tweeting: 'Ha! I LOVE this story about @woodhousecurtis paying a visit to a #keyboardwarrior on Twitter.'

The boxer played 48 times for Birmingham City between 2001 and 2003 after signing from Sheffield United in a £1million deal. He is also  former England under-21 international.
