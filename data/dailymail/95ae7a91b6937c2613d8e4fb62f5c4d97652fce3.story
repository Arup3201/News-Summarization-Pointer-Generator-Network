Hundreds of Radford University graduates received diplomas in the mail over the weekend that had Virginia spelled incorrectly.

The university remained unaware of the error - the third 'I' was missing from 'Virginia' - until Tuesday morning, when a graduate notified officials.

The school has now acknowledged that more than 1,400 students, both undergraduate and graduate students who graduated in the fall of 2012 and spring of 2013, received the marred diplomas.

Meghan McNeice graduated from Radford University in Virginia in May, and she was excited when she got her diploma in the mail on Saturday.
But the 21-year-old media studies major from Richmond, Va., soon heard chatter on Twitter that there was a spelling error on some graduates' diplomas, so she looked at hers again.
Sure enough, the freelance reporter's diploma had the word "Virginia" spelled incorrectly. In one of two instances of the word on the document, the final "i" is omitted, leaving the word spelled "Virgina."
McNeice missed the error the first time she looked at her diploma because, she said, "I was just looking at it as a graduate, I was excited. I wasn't, like, going through copy editing."
In fact, the university remained unaware of the error until Tuesday morning, when a graduate notified officials.
In total, 1,481 undergraduate and graduate diplomas from fall 2012 and spring 2013 were misspelled, according to Joe Carpenter, Radford's chief communications officer.

It has also confirmed that the word ‘thereto’ had been mis-spelt as ‘therto.’

University spokesman Joe Carpenter blamed human error exacerbated by computer technology.

‘The error was caused when the commercial software system used to produce the diplomas within the university's registrar's office was upgraded in the fall of 2012,’ he told ABCNews.com.

‘That software upgrade required that the diploma narrative be re-keyed into the program. It was during the re-keying process that the typographical errors were introduced into the template,’ he said.

‘Radford University regrets any inconvenience this error may have caused our alumni and will be working to correct these errors in a timely manner,’ he added.

Corrected diplomas will be mailed to graduates as soon as possible, but that didn’t prevent angry students from taking to social media to vent their frustrations at the situation.

Meghan McNeice, 21, from Richmond, Va. graduated from Radford in May, and received her media studies diploma in the mail on Saturday.

‘Well I sure hope my thousands of dollars is going to cover a reprint of my diploma! Way to go Radford Virginia isn’t that hard to spell’ she tweeted.

A Facebook posting under the name Becca Barteau read: 'When you send out a document that is supposed to be a professional piece of paper. You might want to check the spelling. Good job Radford you have officially spelled Virginia wrong on my diploma!!!'

And at least one parent took to Facebook to note the issue.

Woody West posted: 'My daugter got her diploma from Radford University It states that it was issued by the Commonwealth of Virgina, not Virginia.'

University officials have set up a customer service email and phone number and will provide that info to graduates in case they have questions.
