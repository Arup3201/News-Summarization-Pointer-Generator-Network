The search for an Alabama woman missing since 2012 has been cast in an even more sinister light this week with the news that she was raped and abused by her grandmother's boyfriend when she was a young girl.

Young mother, Brittney Wood, was raped for two years on and off by, Ronald Robertson, 53, until in 2003, when she was 11-years-old, she accused him of attacking her.

Indeed, since 2012, eleven members of Wood's family have been arrested for having sex with underage relatives in Mobile County.

Robertson was convicted in 2005 and is currently serving a life sentence for first-degree rape charges.

While
 sexual assault victims are not usually named, the fact that Wood is 
missing and her family suspected of systemic pedophilia, AL.Com chose to
 name her.

Since
 her disappearance in May, 2012, after leaving her mother's home, 11 
people including her brother, aunts and uncles have been arrested in 
connection with a huge family sex abuse investigation.

Police have said in the past that they fear that Wood is dead.

The
 large investigation is still continuing and seen the arrest of Chessie 
Wood, 39, Derek Wood, 23, Brittney Wood's brother, according to AL.Com.

The
 recently released files from 2003 show that Wood's sexual abuse first 
emerged after she reported it to a day care director at a local Baptist 
church.

'She
 said Brittney asked her if she could talk to her, but she was afraid 
that someone would get hurt,' according to the Mobile police report.

'She said Brittney wrote a note and told her, 'He touched me in a bad spot.'

When she was 12 years old she testified at Robertson's trial and revealed horrifying details about the case.

She said that once, she tried to evade Robertson by telling him she was thirsty.

'Finally, he told her to get something to drink and come back to the room,' according to the court records.

'She
 left the bedroom and attempted to hide from Robertson to call her 
grandmother. Robertson, however, found her naked hiding by the garbage 
and told her to get back in his room.'

Robertson had know Brittney from birth and had lived with her grandmother for 14 years.

'I helped raise the mother of this child,' said Robertson.

'I'm sorry about what happened,' he said. 'If I hurt them in anyway, I apologize.'

The  arrests are linked to missing 
mother-of-one Brittney Wood, 19, who hasn’t been seen since she left her
 Theodore home, just outside Mobile, to visit her uncle, Donnie Holland,
 in the Styx River area, on Thursday May 31, 2012.

She was last seen in a car with Holland at Tillman's Corner. Two days later he committed suicide using a gun which Brittney owned.

Since
 then 11 people, either members of the Wood family, or with direct links
 to it, have been arrested on charges including rape, sex abuse with 
children under 12, incest and sodomy.

The
 suspects in the sex ring include Brittney’s mother, Chessie Wood, her 
brother, Derek Wood, Nelton ‘Butch’ Morgan, Dustin Kent, William ‘Billy’
 Brownlee, Mendy Kent, Wendy Holland, James Cumbaa, Randall Scott Wood 
and Jennifer Moore, the most recent arrest.

Detectives
 believe that Brittney may have gone to visit her uncle to confront him 
about sex abuse and have voiced their frustration that the one person 
who may be able to shed light on the alleged crimes has disappeared.

Detective Eric Winberg told Fox 10 news in April 2013: ‘We often (sic) times look for that golden nugget. That one person that can make the difference in your case.

Accused: Brittney's mother, Chessie Wood, is charged with two counts of sodomy and sex abuse of a child less than 12

Suspects: Randall Wood (left), who's been 
charged with second degree sodomy, enticing a child to enter and second 
degree rape, and Brittney Wood's brother, Derek Wood (right), who's been
 charged with second degree rape and second degree sodomy

‘In this particular case, Brittney Wood was that person. She was the person that could tell the whole story.’

Police were investigating the abuse before Brittney's disappearance.

Detectives
 say Brittney exchanged messages on Facebook on May 27, 2012, with one 
of the alleged victims, in which abuse was discussed.

After Brittney asked ‘how are you? 
Tell me what's going on. I don't know what's true and what you said’, 
the victim claimed to have been raped by Randall Scott Wood, Dustin 
Kent, and Donald Holland.

‘I love you, I’m sorry,’ Brittney replied.

The alleged victim wrote more messages to Brittney on May 28 and May 30, but did not receive a reply.

In October 2012 a police detective testified in the case against Dustin Kent.

The court heard that Kent raped a relative at the age of 13 in 2008 while her father watched.

According
 to the detective, the father took the young girl out in his truck 
claiming they were going to buy a hamster from a pet store.

Instead they picked up Kent and drove to an industrial park.

allegations

 Wood family, has also been charged, while Jennifer Moore, 32, became 
the 11th arrest in the case

Crucial: Detectives believe Brittney could reveal important information about the case

When the car pulled over, 
Kent took off her clothes and performed a sex act on her before raping 
her as her father watched, Sgt. Scott Congleton testified.

'She kept telling him to stop. He did not,' the detective said.

According to AL.com
 there are at least four victims of alleged abuse. Officers claim some 
of the victims were under the age of 12 when the attacks took place and 
are related to those arrested.

Lead
 prosecutor Mobile County Assistant District Attorney Nicki Patterson 
told the website that suspected victims have been placed in foster care 
where necessary.

'This is a more layered group than we have seen or uncovered here in Mobile,' Patterson said.

'Family members sharing their children, unfortunately, is not new. It is not that unusual from what we know.'

'If you’re getting to a third generation and people are still choosing to abuse, sometimes these networks take place'

'Everybody's main interest here is to protect these kids and do the best job that we can.'

'Most
 of these children are no longer with their immediate family members. 
They are either in foster care or with extended family.'

Speaking to WKRG.com, she added: 'Pretty much everyone in this extended family was having sex with one another and having sex with the children",

Det.
 Terri Hall of the Mobile County Sheriff's Office said:  'For just your 
everyday person, you just can't understand how a family operates the way
 they operate. You just can't. I can't even think of a word to describe 
this family.'

Chessie Wood has accused her deceased brother-in-law of killing Brittney.

She maintains her innocence on the sex abuse charges she faces.

The accused are currently awaiting trial.
