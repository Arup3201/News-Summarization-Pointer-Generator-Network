Lord West of Spithead, a former first sea lord, complained that too many artworks in the Palace of Westminster appeared to be of French battlefield defeats

Paintings in the corridors of Parliament are 'a little mean' because they all depict victories over France, a former head of the Navy has claimed.

Lord West of Spithead, a former first sea lord, complained that too many artworks in the Palace of Westminster appeared to be of French battlefield defeats.

He called for the balance to be redressed, including a mural of the First World War to mark the centenary of the outbreak of the conflict this year.

There are thousands of paintings, sculpture and murals dotted around the Houses of Parliament which form part of a priceless collection.

The Royal Gallery near the House of Lords is dominated by two large 19th century paintings by the Irish artist Daniel Maclise.

One fresco, 'The Death of Nelson', depicts the moment Lord Nelson, was shot aboard HMS Victory during France's defeat at the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805.

Hanging opposite is 'The Meeting of Wellington and Blucher', which shoes the Duke of Wellington and the Prussian Field Marshall Blycher at the La Belle Alliance inn before defeating Napoleon at the Battle of Waterloo in 1815.

Speaking in the Lord today, Lord West said there was too much emphasis on Britain's triumphs over its great rival across the Channel.

The Labour peer said: 'I have noticed around the Palace of Westminster that nearly all the paintings of battle seem to be us defeating the French, which seems a little mean.

'We fought most nations in the world and I wonder in this centenary of the First World War could we maybe commission a mural representing something like Jutland or the famous battle of Amiens in 1918, in time for that commemoration?' 

Lord Sewel, chairman of committees, replied: 'Well, I'm certainly going to duck that one.

'Commissioning of works of art is a matter for the Works of Art Committee and fortunately that is one of the few domestic select committees in this House that I don't chair, and I'm very grateful.'

After leaving the Royal Navy, Lord West was a security minister in Gordon Brown's government. 

He raised the issue of the artworks after Conservative peer Baroness Trumpington joked that she would be dead before the Maclise murals were restored. 

Lord Sewel said the condition of the Waterloo and Trafalgar murals had been investigated during two research projects with the Cologne University of Applied Sciences.

He said results of the research showed there was an opportunity of achieving a 'very high level of restoration'.

Lord Sewel told Lady Trumpington: 'The initial research is now complete and discussions will take place with the university's staff over the summer about the next steps towards restoration.

'The Works of Art Committee will consider a range of possible options in the autumn.'

Lady Trumpington replied: 'It's now several years since I asked my original question on this subject, I should be dead before the damn thing is done.'

She added: 'Would I be right in assuming that the Royal Gallery is much admired and loved by everybody except possibly the French president (and) also for the fact it does show women on the battlefield and on fighting ships?

'And I would be grateful if some speed can be shown in the reconstruction, if necessary, over painting I would have thought, so that we are even more proud of the Royal Gallery when the work is finished.'

Critics warned too many paintings in Parliament were in need of restoration work after several years

Lord Sewel replied: 'I certainly hope it won't be a matter of you looking down kindly on us when the time comes for them to be revealed in their original true glory or as close to their original true glory as we can get it.

'I think the important thing is considering the national and international importance of these murals to get it right rather than to get it soon.

'It's a very challenging task to restore the paintings to as near to their original condition as possible.

'One of the, I think, very heartening results of the research that was carried out was the original pigment beneath the various layers has survived much more successfully in the Royal Gallery than was the case in the robing room.

'So we really do have the opportunity of achieving a very high level of restoration and I think we should make sure we do get it right.'
