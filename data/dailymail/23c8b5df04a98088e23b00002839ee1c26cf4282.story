An account manager who survived a 100ft fall off a cliff while on a stag do at the weekend has revealed he has escaped death on four other occasions.

Garrey Ashton, 44, from Frimley, suffered only cuts, bruises and a trapped nerve in his neck after plunging 100ft over a sheer cliff in Cornwall on Saturday 13.

At the time a hotel worker told him he was lucky to be alive, but Mr Ashton has since explained the accident was actually his fifth brush with death.

Garrey Ashton, 44, suffered only cuts, bruises and a trapped nerve in his neck after falling 100ft over a cliff. He has since revealed he has also survived being run over twice, breaking his neck, and being electrocuted

Mr Ashton said: 'I have been run over twice. The first time was when I was 12 doing a paper round in Frimley. I was going down Balmoral Drive. 

1) Hit by a car while doing a paper round aged 12, received only a few bruises

2) Aged 14, hit by a car again while crossing the road after visiting a friendin hospital

3) Broke vertebrae in his neck while working on the back of a lorry in 1990

4) Received an electric shock at home while replacing back of a plug and accidentally touched the prongs

5) Fell 100ft over a cliff in Cornwall while on a stag do. Suffered cuts, bruises and a trapped nerve in his neck

'I hit the brakes [on my bike] on the way down and a car hit me. I didn't suffer any injuries, just a few bruises.

'The second time was when I was 14. At school, a friend was taken to hospital because he had broken his arm. 

'When he was discharged from Frimley Park, I wanted to get home for my tea. I pressed the traffic lights button and just ran across the road and was run down.

'In 1990, I was working on the back of a lorry when I broke a vertebrae in my neck. The other brush I had was when I got an electric shock when the back came off a plug and I touched the prongs

His latest close shave came after he travelled to Newquay last Friday to attend cousin Lewis Ashton’s engagement party

Mr Ashton, from Frimely, Surrey, was drinking with the group until around midnight, when he left in order to help a disabled member of the party back to the hotel. 

After seeing his friend home safe, he headed back out to rejoin the party at around 12.30am. 

Mr Ashton was knocked unconscious as he fell from this cliff at 12.30am, and woke up at the bottom at 5am when the tide began lapping at his feet

He said: 'We weren’t going crazy. It was the first night, we were pacing ourselves. The lads knew that I’d gone back to the hotel quickly.

'Walking back, I heard the sea. We had all pledged we’d jump in at some stage over the weekend so I thought I’d take a quick look down, but it was pretty dark.

'I stepped over maybe a 3ft fence, but then I slipped on the gravel in the dark. I started sliding - I could see the edge lit up by the moonlight and it was then I just knew that I was going over.'

Mr Ashton said the fall knocked him unconscious, and he only woke up four hours later.

He added: 'I woke up at around 5am with the tide lapping at my feet. I’d lost my shoes at some stage. The last thing that I recall was the sound of the wind in my ears getting louder and louder as I fell.

'My first thought was simply "Blimey, I’m alive!". I was in total shock. I didn’t feel any pain.'

Mr Ashton then fought his way through brambles and nettles back up to the cliff top, where he joined his friends in the hotel for a fry-up breakfast.

'My mates found me and said, "what the hell happened to you last night?", so I just told them - I fell off the cliff,' he said. 'After a few laughs, they got me in an ambulance and sent me off to hospital.'

'The paramedics took a look at the cliff and said it must have been an 80ft-100ft drop. It was absolutely sheer. I didn’t tumble down - I fell down freely.

'A girl from the hotel, Ali, came along with me to the hospital and told me the cliff I fell from was a notorious black spot and that four or five people had died there in the past.'

Mr Ashton was treated for cuts and bruises in Cornwall, and when he arrived back in Surrey, a CT scan revealed he had a trapped nerve in his neck, but was otherwise unhurt.

He added: 'It was only supposed to be a little trip to the beach - I just took a bit of a shortcut. Anyone who knows me knows I’m a bit clumsy. I guess it was a pretty typical stag do overall!'
