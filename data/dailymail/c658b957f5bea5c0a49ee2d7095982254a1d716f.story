As anti-American riots spread to Australia, Al Qaeda urged Muslims to step up protests and kill more U.S. diplomats in Muslim countries in response to the U.S.-made film which mocks the Prophet Mohammed.

The terror group made the appeal as riot police clashed 
with around 200 protesters at the U.S. Consulate in Sydney on Saturday as
 demonstrations against the anti-Islam film 'Innocence of Muslims' spread across the world.

The Al Qaeda statement said; 'Whoever comes across America's ambassadors or emissaries should follow the example of Omar al-Mukhtar's descendants (Libyans), who killed the American ambassador,' the group said, referring to Tuesday's attack on the U.S. consulate in the Libyan city of Benghazi.

'Let the step of 
kicking out the embassies be a step towards liberating Muslim countries 
from the American hegemony,' a statement posted on an  (AQAP) website on Saturday said.

In Australia, Ten Network television 
news showed a policeman knocked unconscious as the mostly male crowd 
hurled bottles and other missiles. Many of the protesters were wearing 
Muslim dress.

Police used pepper spray against
 the protesters, who chanted 'Obama, Obama, we love Osama' and waved 
placards saying 'Behead all those who insult the Prophet.'

Fury about the 
film swept across the Middle East after Friday prayers, with protesters 
attacking U.S. embassies and in protests that killed at least seven 
people and prompted Washington to send troops to bolster security at its
 missions.

'The film 
published in America which insults our Prophet Mohammad, peace be upon 
him, comes as part of the continuing crusader wars against Islam,' 
AQAP's statement said, referring to European wars in the region some 
1,000 years ago.

Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, is mostly militants mainly from Yemen and Saudi Arabia, and  is regarded by the United States as the most dangerous branch of the network founded by Osama bin Laden.

The group has used Yemen, a key regional U.S. ally, to plot attacks on the United States. Washington has backed a Yemeni army campaign that drove al Qaeda and its allies from their southern stronghold this year.

Muslims have blamed the U.S. government for the amateurish film of obscure origin. Washington has condemned the film and said it does not condone any insult to any religion.

Praising the attacks by angry demonstrators in Libya, Egypt, Yemen and Sudan on U.S. and other Western missions as 'natural responses to a huge insult', the statement said that American embassies should be burned and diplomats killed.

It said defending the Prophet's honor was a "religious duty and obligation to the Muslim nation, each according to his ability".

The group also said that Muslims living in the West have an extra duty to be involved in attacks on key targets.

'They are more capable of doing harm and reaching the enemy is easier for them,' it said.

Impoverished Yemen is struggling against challenges on many fronts since mass protests forced president Ali Abdullah Saleh to step down last year after decades in power.

The United States, eager to help the country recover from the upheaval that has pushed it to the brink of collapse, has said it would provide $345 million in security, humanitarian and development aid this year, more than double last year.

A
 total of six police officers were injured, including two who were taken
 to a hospital. Two protesters were treated for police dog bites and 17 
others for the effects of pepper spray, police said in a statement. 
There were no details of their condition.

In Australia, Eight people were arrested on charges including assaulting police and resisting arrest.

Police said they were unsure who organized the protest.

'There
 was little or no organization or control of what they were doing, and 
their actions were disgraceful,' police Superintendent Mark Walton said 
in a statement.

Prime Minister Julian Gillard said the protest was unacceptable.

'Violent protest is never acceptable - not today, not ever,' she said in a statement.
