'Unacceptable': David Davis, the former Tory home affairs spokesman, is leading demands in the Commons for the publication of the Chilcot report

MPs are to demand that the official report into the Iraq war be published in the next few weeks – amid new fears it could be delayed until after the election.

The £10million Chilcot inquiry into the disastrous invasion, which led to 100,000 deaths, was set up six years ago by Gordon Brown but its findings have still not been published.

A cross-party group of MPs is challenging an alleged ‘stitch- up’ said to be delaying publication of the inquiry’s report.

The demand is being led by David Davis, the former Tory home affairs spokesman, who described the failure to publish the document after more than 2,000 days as ‘utterly unacceptable’.

‘Whatever the hold-ups and political wranglings that are delaying publication, the time has come to publish or be damned,’ he said.

‘The suggestion that the report will be delayed until after the election, if it is not ready to be published by the end of February, further damages the inquiry’s credibility and undermines the final report.’

The criticism comes a week after former Tory foreign secretary Lord Hurd said delays in the publication of the report were becoming a ‘scandal’.

The Government says the timing of its release is solely the concern of Sir John Chilcot, who led the inquiry and heard evidence in public from more than 120 witnesses.

But last week it emerged that if the report is not submitted to ministers before the end of February, the Government would not publish it before the election – claiming that there would not be enough time to debate it fully in Parliament.

This argument is being questioned by a cross-party group of MPs including Mr Davis, former Tory attorney general Dominic Grieve and former Liberal Democrat home affairs minister Norman Baker. Labour MP Fabian Hamilton and Elfyn Lloyd, the leader of Plaid Cymru’s Westminster representatives, are also part of the group.

Mr Lloyd said he did not understand why the Government had imposed the February deadline – saying that as Parliament will not rise until the end of March, there would be plenty of time for a debate.

He said he feared that Labour and the Tories – both of whose leaderships supported the 2003 war – had closed ranks to delay the report until after the election. ‘It could be a stitch-up between both benches,’ he said.

Mr Lloyd said he understood that a draft version of the report had been finished almost five months ago. 

‘It looks to me as if not enough effort is being made to publish it,’ he said. ‘When things like war arise, you do have a closing-in.’

Mr Baker told the Observer that there were ‘serious questions that needed to be addressed and answered’ before the election.

‘If there are people blocking publication, the British people need to know why,’ he said.

Part of the reason for the delay is that those people criticised in the Chilcot report have been given the chance to respond to the criticism before publication.

But writing for The Sunday Times, Mr Davis said those facing criticism should not be allowed to hold back publication. He suggested that they be given a deadline of the end of January to give their response.

‘We are no more enlightened as to the failures in the lead-up to, during and after the Iraq War than we were in 2009 when Brown initiated the inquiry,’ he wrote. 

‘The perception of politicians and elites colluding to hide the truth from the public is damaging to all parties at a time when politicians are already held in poor regard.’

‘In any event this is not about personal culpability, of pinning the blame on a small group of individuals, but of collective and systemic failure. It is time to face up to whatever mistakes were made as a nation and consider how best we can avoid them in the future.

‘We cannot allow the sensibilities of our allies, or our current or past politicians, to delay such an important publication any further.

‘Whatever the ramifications, it is time to reveal the truth.’
