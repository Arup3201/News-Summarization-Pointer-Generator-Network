A judge has ruled that the original owners of a three-pound chihuahua which ran away should get the dog back following a three-year legal battle with the couple who took it in.

Lucy was reunited with the Blanton family after an Easley, South Carolina, magistrate court ruled that the pet was theirs under state property law.

The family claimed they were on vacation in 2012 when the dog got loose and ended up at the home of Easley City Councilman Dave Watson and his wife Trisha.

They took the animal in and named it Gracie.

Case: A chihuahua called Lucy has been at the center of a three-year legal battle in South Carolina. Last week she was returned to her original owners 

First family: The Blantons, who now have their beloved pet back following the ruling by a judge in Easley, claimed that she got loose and ran away during a vacation in 2012

The pair said they made every effort to contact the owner but when they found no leads, they decided to keep it. 

Five months later, the Blantons found Lucy and then took the Watsons to court. After five hearings, a judge has decided it should return to its first home.

The Watsons said they were 'shocked' by the decision and have now filed a motion to reconsider in a bid to get the dog, which they believe is theirs, back.  

A devastated Trisha Watson told Fox Carolina: 'When you're our age and you have a dog, for some reason, it's more than an animal ... it becomes part of your family.'

The Blantons on the other hand have said they are relieved their dog is home. Speaking to the station, Kerri Blanton said: 'It's very emotional, it's been a long fight. The fight for the dog became heated at times.'

Initially the Watsons decided to give the dog back, but they changed their minds after the Blantons refused to pay the veterinary bills. 

The judge ruled that in order for the dog to return to the Blantons, they would have to pay $496 for the costs incurred. 

But the Watsons insist that is a fraction of the money spent on the chihuahua in the time she was in their care and believed the figure is closer to $3,000. 

They have now started a GoFundMe page in a bid to raise funds to cover the costs. They also said they chose to fight for Lucy following allegations the Blanton family mistreated her. 

The page says: 'I (Trisha) found this shivering 3 pound little Chi, without a collar, in a chair on our front porch. I had to wrap her up - she was wet, cold, and also in HEAT! 

New home: The dog turned up on the porch at the home of Councilman Dave Watson (pictured) and his wife Trisha. They claim Lucy was shivering when she arrived, even though it was warm outdoors

Hunt: They took the animal to the vet and then tried to track down the owner, but they decided to keep the dog when their search did not create any promising leads

'I called a groomer I know (at home) that Sunday and asked him what to do. I did everything he said. We put up signs including at the neighborhood store and asking people we knew in the neighborhood if they knew who she belonged to. 

'Dave took her to our vet as a stray and had him check for a microchip - no chip. But when the vet did blood work on her, we found out she had liver damage. 

'To date, we have spent $ 3000 getting her healthly. She has to have Hepatic food and medicine everyday. 

'We have had to house train her as well as train her to walk on a lease (with a harness). She would not walk through a door when she first came in May 2012.'

The Watsons have also filed a motion to reconsider with the courts, hoping they might get Lucy back in the future. 

Despite the allegations, the Blantons say the dog has fitted in at home again.

Father Keith told the station: 'She was very excited to see all the kids. Just snuggling and sitting and sleeping, but she's doing real good.' 

Funds: The Watsons set up a GoFundMe page in a bid to cover Lucy's medical bills which they say were $3,000

Allegations: On their page, they posted a text message that accused the first family of mistreating the dog
