A wealthy foreign student at Cambridge is offering a private tutor £48,000 for just 16 weeks work.

The Swiss national failed his first year and must now pass resits to carry on studying at the university.

The 20-year-old has advertised for a Cambridge graduate to coach him through his Natural Sciences exams.

He is willing to pay the right candidate £100-an-hour for the one-off fixed-term contract.

Applicants must have an 'excellent degree' from Cambridge and possess 'superb' scientific knowledge. They must also be a non-smoker who leads 'a physically active lifestyle' and is 'healthy and fit'.

The live-in tutor will be required to work six hours a day, five days a week for sixteen weeks to help the undergraduate, who has ADHD and dyspraxia.

Successful candidates are also expected to socialise with the student - and help him integrate into student life.

They will be get an en-suite guest room in the student’s Cambridge accomodation complete with parking space. They may also have to travel with the student on expenses-paid trips to Zurich.

The advert asks for an 'excellent tutor and at the same time an inspiring mentor' who boasts a 'sunny disposition'.

The student failed his first year at Cambridge by just 0.3 per cent and is retaking two out of four exams.

He has been told he may rejoin the course if he gets at least 50 per cent in both exams.

The advert was posted on Tutors International yesterday, but manager Victoria Gibbs said it was too soon to expect any applications.

Undergraduate: The student will pay the tutor £48,000 for 16 weeks of tuition. The timetable will include around 30 hours work each week, the advert said

It says the applicant should be: 'engaging, have a good sense of humour and a sunny disposition.

'Naturally, he or she is expected to be an excellent tutor and at the same time an inspiring mentor for the positive as well as progressive development of the student’s career in Cambridge.

'The Tutor must devise and implement a full timetable which ensures a thorough understanding of all of the material in the entire syllabi of both target subjects, allows for constant revision of the material covered, and includes thorough exam preparation through regular mock tests and exam questions.

'In addition to the academic work, it would be helpful if the Tutor shared some of the student’s interests.

'This is a demanding role, and it is anticipated that he (and the Tutor!) would both benefit from the opportunity to unwind through a sport such as rowing, or regular trips to the gym, cultural excursions are encouraged though by no means necessary.'

The student, who speaks six languages, is described 'polite' and 'friendly' who will prove 'a pleasure for a capable educator to work with' because of his 'natural intelligence.'

Ms Gibbs said: 'This was one of the more niche jobs we have had.'

Despite winning a place at Cambridge - ranked as third best university on the world - he requires help with time management, organisational skills, memory skills, exam techniques, reading strategies, structuring revision summaries and essay-writing, proof-reading, and managing his attention and focus.

The post is the second unusual job advert on Tutors International’s website.

An Arab businessman in his 30s offered £122,000-a-year to a tutor to turn him into an English speaking, piano playing, opera loving student worthy of a place at Oxford University.

The student is
a 20 year-old male who needs help preparing for two of his first year 
exams (NatSci Tripos 1A) in Natural Sciences: Cell Biology and 
Chemistry. He has recently had diagnosis of dyspraxia and ADHD 
confirmed, both of which have had a negative impact on his exam 
preparation to date.

The Tutor must be aware of these issues and help to
devise strategies and techniques which will assist both with exam 
preparation for this year and future studies as the course progresses.

The
young man is a very intelligent Swiss student who was brought up in a 
multi-cultural family and is fluent in six languages.

Revision role: The Cambridge University student's tutor will also be expected to 'unwind' with him by playing sport

Although he has 
been aware of various difficulties in his learning, his natural 
intelligence and excellent work ethic have so far been enough to carry 
him through his academic career. However, now he is at Cambridge, his 
coping techniques are proving unsatisfactory, and his previously minor 
issues have become big obstacles that are now impeding his academic 
progress.

The Tutor is 
required to work with the student for a minimum of six hours a day, five
days a week for sixteen weeks from early January through spring/summer 
exam period.

The Tutor must devise and implement a full timetable which 
ensures a thorough understanding of all of the material in the entire 
syllabi of both target subjects, allows for constant revision of the 
material covered, and includes thorough exam preparation through regular
mock tests and exam questions.

The
successful Tutor must be a recent graduate from Cambridge with an 
excellent degree in the biological science stream of Natural Sciences, 
or a supervisor of the two subjects.

In
addition to the academic work, it would be helpful if the Tutor shared 
some of the student’s interests. This is a demanding role, and it is 
anticipated that he (and the Tutor!) would both benefit from the 
opportunity to unwind through a sport such as rowing, or regular trips 
to the gym, cultural excursions are encouraged though by no means 
necessary.

In the spirit of 
building a solid and academically successful Tutor-Student relationship,
it is advantageous to build a friendship along with the academic work. 
As an international student at a College in the far south of the city, 
the student doesn’t feel as integrated into Cambridge life as he could 
be, and it would be appreciated if the Tutor could help to alleviate 
this added social pressure by helping him to embrace the opportunities 
that Cambridge affords, the student traditions and culture, and by 
generally helping him to experience all that the city has to offer.
