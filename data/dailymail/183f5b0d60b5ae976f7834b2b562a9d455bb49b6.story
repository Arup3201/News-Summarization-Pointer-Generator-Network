Fingerprints, DNA evidence and CCTV footage are still being compiled in the murder case against former NSW detectives Roger Rogerson and Glen McNamara, a court has heard.

Rogerson and McNamara have been charged with the shooting murder of 20-year-old student Jamie Gao in a rented storage shed in May. His body was found wrapped in a tarpaulin floating in the sea off a beach in Cronulla, southern Sydney, on May 26.

They have also been accused of commercial drug supply.

Lawyer Paul Kenny, for Rogerson, 73, did not require him to be videoed in from Silverwater Correctional Centre while McNamara, 55, is in Goulburn prison.

Police prosecutors told the court more time was needed to assemble some of the scientific evidence in the case, and there were significant delays in autopsy reports on the victim.

Central Local Court heard that up to five weeks was needed to assemble fingerprint evidence from the crime scene and DNA testing of clothing.

Evidence to be presented in the case included analysis of methylamphetamines allegedly found in McNamara's car.

However, although a postmortem had been completed on Mr Gao, there was a six-to-nine-month delay at the Sydney morgue on the autopsy report.

Police allege the University of Technology Sydney student was shot in a storage facility by McNamara and Rogerson during a botched drug deal on May 20.

McNamara was charged and faced Kogarah Local Court on May 26.
