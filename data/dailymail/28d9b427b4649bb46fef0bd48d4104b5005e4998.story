The South African goalkeeper has played for Orlando Pirates since 2006, becoming first choice for the club in 2012.

In 2008 he swapped shirts with Wayne Rooney when Manchester United played the Pirates in a pre-season friendly in Durban.

In 2013 his performances in the African Champions League were nothing short of exceptional. He kept seven clean-sheets in 16 games, helping the Pirates to the final.

Since making his debut in 2013 against Swaziland, Meyiwa won six caps for South Africa, the most recent coming this month, as captain.

During the current Africa Cup of Nations qualifying campaign Meyiwa has played all four games for South Africa, without conceding a single goal.

In September he was made captain of the national team in the absence of Itumeleng Khune.

The South African police took to Twitter to break the news, breaking protocol to inform the South African people of the keeper's death

The police account emphasised their desire to bring the killers to justice, after suspects fled the scene 

'Two guys entered the house and demanded cellphones, money and other valuables,' provincial Community Safety official Sizakele Nkosi-Malubane said.

'Senzo tried to protect Kelly because one of the men had a gun pointed towards her.'

Police reported that two men entered the house where Meyiwa was shot,  where an altercation took place, while one waited outside.

The South African goalkeeper was reportedly shot before all three suspects fled on foot. He was declared dead on arrival at hospital. 

A statement on behalf of South African sports minister Fikile Mbalula read: 'We have already interacted with the president of SAFA, Dr Danny Jordaan, Dr Irvin Khoza at Orlando Pirates as well as the father of Senzo Meyiwa.

'We humbly encourage all individuals who have any information on on the whereabouts of these thugs to co-operate fully with the police on the urgent apprehension of these shameless individuals.

'We urge the police to leave no stone unturned in apprehending the thugs as a matter of urgency. Our society will never be at peace until the suspects have been arrested and been brought under the wrath of the country's legal system.

'We would like to convey our heartfelt condolences to Senzo Meyiwa's family, his club, Orlando Pirates, the nation and the entire football and sporting fraternity.'

Mbalula added: 'The death of Senzo Meyiwa has robbed this country of an icon and a legend in the making.' 

Police are offering a reward of 150,000 Rand (£8,500) for any information leading to the arrests of the suspects.

Meyiwa's club, Orlando Pirates, released a statement expressing 'sadness' at his 'untimely death'.

'This is a sad loss whichever way you look at it - to Senzo's family, his extended family, Orlando Pirates and to the nation', commented the chairman Dr Irvin Khoza.  

The South African captain posted two pictures from international duty with Bafana Bafana from their recent games in the Congo

Meyiwa had been in superb form for both club and country recently, leading Orlando Pirates to last season's African Champions League final, including a superb performance against TP Mazembe during which he saved two penalties. 

Since breaking into the national team last year, he claimed the No 1 spot in the absence of Itumeleng Khune, and was made captain in September.

During the current Africa Cup of Nations qualifying campaign Meyiwa played all four games for Bafana Bafana,without conceding a single goal.

South Africa's head coach Ephraim Mashaba said: 'Since he took on that (captain's) role, we never had issues with the team and staff.

'We never had issues with players coming to us after that.

'He had that personality that meant that he could easily diffuse a situation.

'I spoke to a lady earlier, from last week in fact. Where he heard she was building a house. He gave her money to carry on. 

'Senzo was not just a goalkeeper. He was a peacemaker. That's the biggest thing I remember about him.

'A good guy like Senzo will never just vanish. His spirit will live forever.' On Saturday night he was in goal for his club in a 4-1 victory over Ajax Cape Town.
