This is not a picture referee Mark Clattenburg is likely to be sharing with his friends and colleagues.

Dirk Kuyt, who has been linked with a return to the Premier League with Southampton, tweeted a picture showing off his Kung Fu skills on Wednesday.

And the sight of the flying Dutchman may well have stirred up unhappy memories for Clattenburg.

The Durham official infamously failed to show a red card to Kuyt, then playing for Liverpool, for a Kung Fu kick style tackle on Everton's Phil Neville during a Merseyside derby in 2007.

Clattenburg had earlier shown a red card to Everton defender Tony Hibbert after appearing to pull out a yellow card and then changing his mind following a brief exchange with Steven Gerrard.

Clattenburg did not referee another Everton match until 2012.

And Clattenburg could get the chance to referee Kuyt again if Ronald Koeman gets his way.

The Southampton boss wants to bring fellow Dutchman back to the Premier League in January.

The 34-year-old ended a six-year spell in England when he quit Liverpool for Turkish side Fenerbahce in 2012. 

Kuyt, who scored 71 times in 285 matches for the Anfield giants and 24 goals in 104 international appearances, is out of contract at the end of the season.

Southampton boss Ronald Koeman is interested in signing fellow Dutchman Kuyt in January
