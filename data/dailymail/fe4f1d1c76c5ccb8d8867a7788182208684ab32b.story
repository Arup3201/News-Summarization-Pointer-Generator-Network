A man who mysteriously disappeared and was officially declared dead after a 1977 barn fire in Canada has been found alive and well, living under a different name in the U.S.

Ronald Stan was 32 years old when he went missing after the blaze in rural East Williams, Canada on September 29, 1977.

Nine years later, he was officially declared dead.

But a routine audit in July by the Ontario Provincial Police turned up a different story.

Mystery solved: A man who went missing in Ontario 37 years ago was found alive and well in Oklahoma in an audit carried out by the Ontario Provincial Police (stock photo of a department squad car above)

In a Monday press release, OPP said they tracked Stan down to Oklahoma where the now 69-year-old has been living under the name of Jeffrey Walton.

OPP Const Laurie Houghton told MailOnline that Walton left behind family in Canada and that they have been informed of his whereabouts in America. 

U.S. Authorities have also been made aware of Walton's disappearance, but Houghton would not say whether they were independently investigating. 

Canadian authorities do not plan to press charges against Stan and the case is now closed

Houghton would not release further details on Stan and said she could not 'speak to his motives'. 

According to public records, a 69-year-old named Jeffrey Walton lives in Park Hill, Oklahoma.

Calls to his phone were not being accepted Monday afternoon.
