Arsene Wenger is unlikely to have popped out the 'pop-out Wenger' souvenir from the match-day programme to place on his mantelpiece.

He will not want any reminder of the occasion, his first reunion with Monaco.

Rather like his 1,000th Arsenal game, a 6-0 defeat at Chelsea, this turned out to be a long sentimental preamble followed by 90 disastrous minutes.

He seemed utterly dejected as he tried to analyse the performance.

All the recent glimmers of encouragement were washed away and what seemed a genuine chance to reach the last eight of the Champions League for the first time in five years turned into one of the worst European performances of the Wenger era.

Even after 15 years of elite European football, Arsenal still gallop headlong into these two-legged ties with astonishing naivety.

With priorities all wrong, too loose at the back, without urgency on the ball, unable to prevent an away goal, over-committed to attack and unable to recognise the signs and adjust when things are going so badly it's time cut losses.

Perhaps after routinely drawing powerhouses like Bayern Munch, Barcelona and AC Milan at this stage, they thought it was too easy.

It had been received as a good draw when the teams were paired, back in December; one Arsenal had dared to hope for, and then this…

Boom, to quote the firecracker launched from the away end as the travelling fans celebrated Dimitar Berbatov scoring Monaco's second of the night.

Berbatov, a former Tottenham striker, had been jeered when he first touched the ball, but the home crowd seemed to have lost interest in such tactics of intimidation by the time he lashed the ball past David Ospina, early in the second half.

Don't expect to see any jubilant 'selfies' from the home dressing room to go viral after this one.

For Wenger and his players, thoughts quarter-finals suddenly seem a long way off against Leonardo Jardim's team who rarely leak goals even last night when they were without their entire first-choice back-four.

Jardim's team were well-drilled and composed in their defensive duties. The revitalised team from the millionaire's paradise on the Med parked the Bentley. Then they suckered Arsenal on the break as they admired the wheels.

But with one of the final kicks of the game, Yannick Ferreira-Carrasco made the score 3-1 to Monaco

Monaco have never lost to English opposition in the knock-out rounds of this competition and it will take a heroic effort from Wenger's team in the second leg to buck that trend.

Chelsea have fought back from 3-1 down to win at this stage of the Champions League, twice in the last three years, but that was with the second leg at home. And, that was Chelsea, a mature team with strength and character.

After watching this game, it is hard to imagine Arsenal keeping a clean sheet in the Stade Louis II as they pour forward in search of goals.

The win at Manchester City offered encouragement but last night the defensive problems were back in full force, while in possession they lacked any urgency until Theo Walcott came on and the strikers misfired badly.

Wenger's decision to replace Olivier Giroud was celebrated by home fans who hailed him a two goal-hero in the FA Cup against Middlesbrough on his last outing at the Emirates Stadium. 

It is a painfully delicate balance inside the Arsenal family.

On came Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain to join Santi Cazorla in one of the holding midfield partnerships you thought you would never see.

Wenger was frantically gambling long before his team set foot in Monte Carlo.

No sooner had Oxlade-Chamberlain pulled one back to offer a lifeline, than Arsenal fell to pieces again and gifted Monaco the third.

After months of planning since the draw in December, this was such a hastily scrambled mess.

The original midfield pairing of Cazorla and Francis Coquelin, so impressive and well balanced since it came together, was missing as Monaco took the lead.

A ripple of discontent washed around the Emirates, an oh-no-not-again ripple.

This place has yet to witness any of those truly great European nights which Highbury enjoyed.

Perhaps until it does, it will always seem strangely cold and corporate. There were times last night when the away fans made more noise, with their colour-coordinated plastic ponchos, which had the pleasing effect of producing a large Monaco flag.

For Wenger this was Champions League match number 161. His status as one of the iconic modern coaches was underlined by the build-up to a game which was all about him.

But the nearest he has ever been to lifting this trophy came in Paris, nine years ago, when a team reduced to ten men, could not cling on to a lead and were beaten by Barcelona.

This morning, after such a sobering night, those giddy heights seem unlikely to be scaled again.

Will he ever win it? The dream is fading.
