Saved her marriage: Fiona Potter and her husband almost broke up over her lack of interest in sex

A mother-of-two has finally achieved a 'mind-blowing' orgasm with her husband of 13 years after years of rejecting him.

Fiona Potter, 34, from Mundon, Essex, had such a low sex drive it almost cost her her marriage, until the couple sought help from a sex therapist.

Fiona admitted she would have been content to only have sex with husband, Adam, three times a year, explaining: 'It feels like a domestic duty, and that's why I don't want to do it because it feels like a chore.'

The carer, who works nights, has a 15-year-old son called Luke from a previous relationship and a five-year-old daughter, Grace, with Adam.

She explained her low sex drive was because she 'can't be bothered'.

She said: 'I would rather 
go to sleep because I'm always tired and working.'

She added: 'I do love Adam, I just don't know how to show him.'

Mechanic Adam revealed the situation became so bad he considered a separation.

He said: 'Sometimes she'll say "not tonight" but most
 of the time she'll lay there frozen solid and blank me out totally.

'It 
got to the point where I had enough and I told her I was going to leave. I
 was sick of the constant rejection. For me to not want to see Grace 
every day shows how far I have been pushed.'

The couple share their story in a new documentary on More 4 called The Week The Women Came, which reveals that one in three women have sexual difficulties that rob them of ability to orgasm.

It's something sex therapist Trudy Hannington is all too familiar with as she regularly treats people with sex and relationship problems at her clinic in Yorkshire.

She said: 'Sex is almost seen like a luxury, so 
if something goes wrong it's the last thing that gets fixed and people 
find it quite difficult to ask for help.

'It's almost like it's not 
important enough. But from what I see, when sex goes wrong it's 
devastating. It damages a woman's confidence and sex esteem, which has a 
knock on effect on the rest of their life.'

Trudy agrees to help Fiona and Adam ignite their sex life, and found some of their problems could be traced back to Fiona's childhood and turbulent teenage years.

Fiona told how her parents split up when she was 11 and she rarely saw her father after he remarried and started a new family.

She was raised as a Christian by her mother and taught that sex before marriage was wrong. As a result she 'rebelled', and at the age of 16 became pregnant.

She explained: 'It was my way of saying "up yours, it's legal, I can do what I want."'

She had a miscarriage but then fell pregnant another two times, suffering another miscarriage and having an abortion, before having son, Luke, at the age of 18.

Trudy said Fiona's early experiences of sex didn't show her how fun it could be but that it always came with serious consequences.

Fiona then had another boyfriend who she said once forced himself upon her when she didn't feel like sex, and that left her emotionally damaged.

She said: 'He kept persisting so in the end I just
 had sex with him to get him off me. After that I used sex 
as a means of control. I think might be why I have problems now.'

But Fiona was keen to learn how to drop her defences and issues from previous relationships in order to save her marriage.

Trudy advised the couple to be more affectionate with one another and regularly pay one another compliments.

Fiona admitted she would previously avoided any intimacy with her husband - even a cuddle - for fear it would make him think it would lead to sex

Trudy imposed a sex ban on the pair so they could learn to be affectionate without Fiona worrying that she would then be obliged to take it further.

She also encouraged them to make more time for one another by having regular date nights and recommended Fiona read erotic fiction to get her in the mood more often.

After following Trudy's advice, the couple had a break through. They admitted the imposed sex ban increased their desire for one another and they then finally had sex they both enjoyed.

Fiona said: 'The first time we had mind-blowing sex it was a turning point. We realised we had neglected one another for quite some time. We had sex like we've never had it before and sat there for ages afterwards saying "blimey that was good".'

The couple now have a happy sex life and are more affectionate and open with one another.

Trudy also helps 58-year-old Elaine Feeley in the documentary. She hadn't had sex with her husband for four years after the menopause made it too painful and was keen to find a way to revive their sex life.
