Once again, the Daily Mail has won a string of prizes at the prestigious annual Press Awards – the Oscars of British journalism.

The incomparable and prolific Quentin Letts was named Columnist of the Year, while Matt Lawton picked up Sports Journalist of the Year after producing a series of what the judges called ‘fantastic’ exclusives.

In the Interviewer of the Year category, Rebecca Hardy was awarded the title. The judges praised her for being ‘sensitive and able to win the trust of families at a highly emotional time’. 

Frances Hardy was highly commended in the same category for her ‘moving, poignant’ interviews.

City Correspondent Peter Campbell was named Young Journalist of the Year. The judges said he ‘already writes with maturity and a sure-footed style’.
