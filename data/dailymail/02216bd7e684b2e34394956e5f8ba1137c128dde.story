A headteacher who used school funds to pay for a trip to China, tickets to a Cliff Richard concert and for loans totalling more than £50,000 to herself and staff has been banned from the classroom.

Patricia Black, 64, was handed a Prohibition Order by Education Secretary Michael Gove banning her from teaching for at least the next years - effectively ending her 40-year career.

A Teaching Agency disciplinary panel found her guilty of 'unacceptable professional conduct' while head at Chantry Special School, in Falling Lane, Yiewsley, after a string of financial irregularities came to light when the London Borough of Hillingdon carried out a routine audit in May 2010.

The panel also found that Ms Black failed to properly declare conflicts of interest when employing her daughter and son at the school and giving her brother a role as a co-ordinator.

It said 'the need to be open and transparent and make declarations became more acute once the family members had received loans paid from school monies'.

It said that, after employing her son, Stephen Black, she paid him a higher-than-normal salary.

The panel found that she inappropriately transferred monies to the school’s private Voluntary Fund from the School Grant account, which included sums received from other London Boroughs for the education of particular children that should have been used for the benefit of those pupils or retained in the school budget.

It found that she then used Voluntary Fund money - intended for the sole purpose of benefiting pupils - for staff social activities on several occasions, including for various meals and almost £500 for her and the school’s Business Manager, Ann Bennett, to attend a Cliff Richard concert at Wembley on November 11, 2008 and stay at a hotel in Regent’s Park.

Finding that she also used school money, including from the Voluntary Fund, for a trip to China for herself and Bennett, it described the various expenditure as 'unnecessary and excessive'.

It also found that she inappropriately managed the school budget by giving herself loans totalling approximately £20,000, including a sum of £5,000 from the Voluntary Fund.

She also gave a number of loans to other staff, including £20,000 to one to buy a car and sums to others of £5,000, £1,000, £3,200, £550, £500 and between £1,500-2,000.

Giving the decision on the Secretary of State’s behalf, Teaching Agency deputy director Alan Meyrick said: 'As headteacher, Ms Black was in a position of trust and her behaviours represent a significant breach of that trust.

'The Panel recognised that, until her misuse of school monies and abuse of position as a head teacher was uncovered, the teacher had a long unblemished career. Further, it was conscious that it received no evidence regarding the standard of her teaching.

'The panel recommends that Ms Black be prohibited from teaching and I concur with that recommendation.'

He added that the conduct was so serious that she should be ineligible to apply to be restored to the teaching register for ten years, by which time she will be past retirement age.

The decision means that she is prohibited from teaching in any school, Sixth Form College, relevant youth accommodation or children’s home in England.

She has a right of appeal to the High Court within 28 days.
