As the entire country is in mourning for the tragic loss of Phillip Hughes, their hearts are also going out to young bowler Sean Abbott who attended today's funeral for the much-loved cricketer.

Possibly the biggest day of the young cricketer's life, the 22-year-old was surrounded by his cricketing family at the Macksville Recreational Centre in Macksville in northern NSW on Wednesday.

Wearing a navy blue suit and dark sunglasses, he was accompanied by his girlfriend, Brier Neil, who did not leave her grief-stricken partner's side throughout the heart-wrenching service.

Abbott has received overhwelming love and support during the past eight days since the tragedy

Abbott was the unfortunate player who delivered the bouncer that struck Hughes in the neck during the Sheffield Shield clash at the Sydney Cricket Ground last Tuesday. 

The 22-year-old has received overwhelming support from the entire cricket community including Hughes' own family who told Daily Mail Australia the day before the funeral on Tuesday that they were looking forward to seeing Abbott and embracing him with open arms.

A family member expressed the empathy they felt Abbott's unbearable situation

'We can't wait to see Sean Abbott tomorrow and give him a big kiss and hug,' the family member told Daily Mail Australia at the time.

'We just want to tell him it was freak accident and he cannot think he had anything to do with it.

'No one is blaming him. We want to hug him and tell him that everything is okay.'

Possibly the biggest day of the young cricketer's life

The courageous young man returned to training on Tuesday with his New South Wales Blues team mates today who rallied around the player at a training session at the SCG.

'It's the whole squad that really needs everyone's support,' a spokeswoman for Cricket NSW told Daily Mail Australia.

'We want to keep supporting them as a group there were a lot of Phillip's friends in the team,' she said. 

Late last week, friends and mentors at the Baulkham Hills Cricket Club, the north-western Sydney institution where Abbott discovered his talent for cricketas a young boy, joined countless Australians in rallying around the up-and-coming-cricketer.

When one of 'Sabs's' team-mates dropped a crucial catch as a youngster, he was always the good sportsman who would pat them on the back and reassure them it would be OK, they said.

Ian Chatman, who managed Abbott's junior team for about eight years and witnessed his first century, told Daily Mail Australia he was a grounded young man who was 'loved by everyone, and still is.'

'He was really loved by his team-mates, and he cared about them as well,' said Mr Chatman, who said Abbott would be 'devastated' by Tuesday's events.

'He was always making sure that you know, if someone dropped a catch, he'd be over there patting them on the back saying, "Don't worry about it, it's okay".'

Hughes' sister Megan and Australian skipper Michael Clarke both consoled the devastated cricketer in the immediate aftermath of his friend's death. And they were far from alone.

Prime Minister Tony Abbott and Opposition Leader Bill Shorten both spoke in support of the struggling cricketer.

Former Australian national Test captain Adam Gilchrist tweeted: 'May those footprints in the sand now support another young man in need. #SeanAbbott'.
