Manchester City striker Stevan Jovetic believes plenty of goals in a victory against Manchester United this weekend will be the perfect way to lift the club.

The Barclays Premier League champions appear to have lost their sparkle in recent games, with a shock Capital One Cup defeat by Newcastle on Wednesday following a loss to West Ham and a Champions League draw at CSKA Moscow.

Jovetic said: 'We need to be more determined and we need to score goals, because we are a team that scores more goals than everybody and when we don't score we have problems.

'It happened last night. I hope the next game we will score again.

'We won this cup (the Capital One Cup) last year and we wanted to win it again.

'Unfortunately we didn't make it but now we must forget, recover well and think about the next game.'

The next week could be critical to City's campaign. They already trail impressive leaders Chelsea by six points in the Premier League and another loss to United could seriously damage their title defence.

That game is quickly followed by a visit from CSKA and anything less than victory in that game could leave them struggling to maintain interest in the Champions League. That in turn could put Pellegrini under the spotlight.

City manager Manuel Pellegrini had a night to forget against Newcastle. He made seven changes but two of the stars who did start, David Silva and Yaya Toure, suffered injuries.

Silva is now a doubt for the derby after limping out of the action with a knee problem after just nine minutes. Toure was later withdrawn as a precaution due to a groin injury. 

Asked what went wrong against Newcastle, Jovetic said: 'I think maybe the goal - they scored early. After that we tried, we played, we had some chances but we couldn't score.

'At the end they scored a second goal. They deserved the win.'

Like Jovetic, goalkeeper Willy Caballero also believes the United clash could offer the perfect opportunity to restore confidence.

The Argentine, signed in the summer from Pellegrini's former club Malaga, said: 'It's a big opportunity for us to change this. We need to recover, forget about this match and only think about United.

'It's always a really, really big match. When I have watched these games from my house you can tell how big it is.

'For us it is a big opportunity, but we need a best performance from every player to win this game.'
