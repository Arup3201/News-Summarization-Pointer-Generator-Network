They may have been booed at the VMAs - but that won't take the sheen off the latest rumours surrounding the One Direction boys.

The band is said to have been booked to perform at the Victoria's Secret show in November.

According to the Sun, Niall Horan, Harry Styles, Louis Tomlinson, Zayn Malik and Liam Payne will follow in the footsteps of Justin Bieber and Jay-Z as they take to the catwalk during the annual fashion extravaganza.

The band's management are yet to confirm reports, but if true, the performance would be the latest in a line of triumphs for the quintet, whose behind-the-scenes film This Is Us arrives in cinemas on Friday.

According to the brand itself though, the boys should not be oiling up their limbs just yet.

'The recent reports regarding One Direction appearing in the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show are untrue,' they said in a statement issued this afternoon.

'The band is not performing in this year's show. We will announce our artists in early October.'

Last year, performances from Justin Bieber, Rihanna and Bruno Mars helped the televised Victoria's Secret show rack up seven million viewers, although proceedings weren't without controversy.

Justin Bieber reportedly made the most of his appearance on the show, ending the night backstage with 19-year-old 
model, Barbara Palvin - much to the disgust of then girlfriend, Selena 
Gomez.

At least the One Direction boys will have some familiar faces around them on the night, with model-of-the-moment Cara Delevingne - who has been linked to Harry Styles - due to strut her stuff during the show.

Other big names set to take to the runway include Miranda Kerr, Candice Swanepoel, Adriana Lima and Alessandra Ambrosio.

One Direction are currently riding 
high in the charts with new single, Best Song Ever, and last week saw 
their debut fragrance, Our Moment, rack up an impressive waiting list 
ahead of its launch at Harrods last Friday.

'Their global superstar status will 
be solidified with this booking,' a source told the Sun. 'Bigwigs at the
Victoria's Secret and the televisi√≥n network CBS, which broadcasts the 
show, have been having meetings with the band and management.

'It's being said they pretty much have it in the bag as they were sold on their personalities.'
