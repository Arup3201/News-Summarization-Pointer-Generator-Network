A man and a woman have died after a light aircraft crashed near a runway at manufacturers Airbus UK this afternoon.

The male pilot died instantly and his female passenger died later in hospital after the crash, which is believed to have happened as their light aircraft was coming in to land at Hawarden Airport in Flintshire, north Wales.

North Wales Police were informed of the incident involving a twin-engine aircraft in Broughton at about 1.10pm today.

Police were called to the scene at Hawarden Airport at about 1.10pm, where the wreckage was found

Friends of Mr Vickers and Ms Clarke said they were returning from a Paris shopping trip when the plane crashed

A police spokesman said: 'The man was pronounced dead at the scene and the woman was taken to the Countess of Chester Hospital where she later died.'

North Wales Fire and Rescue Service sent three appliances to the scene but the wreckage of the aircraft just yards off the runway was tackled by on-site firefighters from the nearby Airbus factory.

One worker said: 'The pilot was in trouble and there was a crash landing at the airport. It is a terrible tragedy.'

Engineer Owen Reid, who witnessed the accident, wrote on Twitter: 'I was in the car park as it came in and saw the whole thing.  It looked pretty bad.'

The man and woman have not yet been formally identified, and no-one else was onboard. A spokesman for Airbus said the crash at the Hawarden airfield did not involve one of its aircraft.

Police said a full investigation would be undertaken to establish the full circumstances of the incident. 

A spokesman for the Air Accidents Investigation Bureau (AAIB) said: 'We have deployed a team to the airport to investigate.'

Chester Hawarden Airport lies near the Welsh border with England, four miles south-west of Chester, and has a large Airbus factory which produces aircraft wings.

During the Second World War Hawarden was a maintenance base for RAF aircraft.
