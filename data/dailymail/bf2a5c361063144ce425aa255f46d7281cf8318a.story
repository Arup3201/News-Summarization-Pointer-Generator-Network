Jonathan Trott convinced England's selectors he was ready to return to the Test arena with his mature Lions captaincy, and runs, this winter.

It is 16 months since Trott had to leave the 2013/14 Ashes with a stress-related problem, and it was not until the second half of last summer that he began to demonstrate he was capable of producing his best form again.

The man once inked in at No 3 for England duly returned to the squad on Wednesday, although he is now likely to be competing for an opening slot alongside captain Alastair Cook in the West Indies next month.

Trott was included alongside three prospective debutants in the 16-man squad - Yorkshire pair Adam Lyth and Adil Rashid, plus Durham's Mark Wood.

Durham all-rounder Ben Stokes was also named on Wednesday morning, returning to the fold as England seek to erase the embarrassment of their early World Cup exit and start an Ashes year of Test cricket by winning in the Windies.

However, it is the inclusion of Trott which dominated the agenda after his return to form with Warwickshire and the Lions.

'Really well done for all the efforts he's put in for the last 12 months,' national selector James Whitaker told ecb.co.uk.

'He seems to be enjoying his cricket again, which is the main thing we wanted to see, and he's very relaxed.

'He is a player of proven international pedigree, and we are delighted to welcome him back into the squad.'

Whitaker added on Sky Sports News: 'People go on Lions tours, and it gives them a good indication of the next level up, and Jonathan embraced that.

'He wanted to captain the team, which he did very well. It added to his experience, and he really enjoyed it.

'It's just a marker for us to gauge him by ... and he's happy to go again.'

Trott will be 34 next month, but England also have some younger personnel to welcome in the Caribbean - where Lyth, prolific for county champions Yorkshire last summer, will push Trott to partner Cook.

Whitaker said of Lyth: 'We think he offers us something different at the top as an option, and of course he'll push for that opening spot.

'He's worked hard for Yorkshire, and been part of a championship-winning team.'

It is more than five years since Rashid - one of six Yorkshire players in England's squad - won the last of his 10 limited-overs caps.

But at 27, the selectors believe the leg-spinning all-rounder is an improved cricketer.

Whitaker said: 'We sense a growing maturity with him ... and we hope he can now take that next step into the international stage and contribute to winning Test matches for England.'

There is excitement too to have a 'young, quick bowler in our midst' in the shape of 25-year-old Wood - who said: 'I am delighted.

'Especially when I haven't played that many games, it is good that people have seen something in me.' 

England are in need of some experience after Eoin Morgan's side's disastrous Cricket World Cup

Alastair Cook will return as Test captain after losing his role to Eoin Morgan at the World Cup

Cook picks up the reins again after being replaced as World Cup captain before Christmas, only for England to then endure a miserable early exit from the tournament under Eoin Morgan.

Eight of those who fell short in the 50-over format are retained for the Test trip to the Windies.

Moeen Ali and Chris Woakes, who both finished the World Cup injured, are not among them as they recover from their respective side and foot problems - although the Worcestershire all-rounder may join the tour later, depending on his progress.

James Anderon's place was all-but assured, and his inclusion means he can prepare for his 100th Test in Antigua, where he will need just four more victims to go past Ian Botham as England's all-time leading Test wicket-taker. 

AN Cook (Captain), IJL Trott, A Lyth, GS Ballance, IR Bell, JE Root, JC Buttler (wkt), JM Bairstow (wkt), BA Stokes, AU Rashid, JC Tredwell, LE Plunkett, SCJ Broad, CJ Jordan, JM Anderson, MA Wood.
