A Miami-based businessman and aviation enthusiast has become the first person to fly in a private three-room cabin that has been dubbed the world’s most exclusive – and expensive – airline seat.

After months of anticipation and fanfare, Etihad Airways’ Airbus A380 superjumbo jet made its inaugural commercial flight from London Heathrow Airport to Abu Dhabi on Saturday.

Gino Bertuccio and a guest were seated comfortably in The Residence, a ‘penthouse in the sky’ that costs £14,000 for a one-way flight for one or two people.

The Residence boasts three rooms - a bedroom with a double bed, ensuite shower room and living room

Etihad’s VIP concierge team took care of all of Mr Bertuccio’s needs, including limousine transfers and custom menu planning.

He said: ‘There were many firsts on this inaugural flight – new amenities, services and other innovations to try.

‘Flying in The Residence by Etihad was a truly unique adventure, the top of luxury. My only wish was that the flight was longer.’

Mr Bertuccio runs Ligi Import Corp, an Italian cosmetic retailer, and has been passionate about flying since he was a child.

He is an avid collector of airline memorabilia with nearly 2,000 model aircraft and albums filled with boarding passes and photos from past flights, and he has travelled on 22 inaugural and final flights in premium class cabins in the last 25 years.

On this occasion, Flight EY12 departed Heathrow with a full complement of 498 passengers (two in The Residence, nine in first class, 70 in business and 417 in economy) at 9:15am.

It was the first time the double-decker aircraft carried paying customers on the seven-hour journey between the UK and United Arab Emirates capitals.

Etihad, the national carrier of United Arab Emirates, will operate daily flights on the London-Abu Dhabi route and by August 2015 on all of its three services.

In June it will add the A380 to its Abu Dhabi-Sydney route.

In addition to a bedroom, The Residence boasts a private ensuite bathroom (pictured) and living room

Located on the A380’s forward upper deck, The Residence is an ultra-luxurious suite that boasts a living room, separate ensuite shower room and bedroom with a double bed.

It is the first of its kind and it is the only private cabin to come with a dedicated Savoy-trained butler.

On Saturday’s flight Georgina Henderson, from Merseyside, became the world’s first in-flight butler.

She has been working for Etihad for four years and was part of a group of 13 employees who were selected to train for three weeks at the Savoy Academy.

The 28-year-old, who has a degree in broadcast journalism, was previously a food and beverage manager on Etihad’s long-haul fleet and once worked at BBC Radio Merseyside in Liverpool.

Etihad is using The Residence to try to lure wealthy travellers, especially those who would normally opt for a private jet.

The airline says the 125-square-foot penthouse has many of the amenities associated with a private plane at ‘barely a tenth of the cost’ for the same journey.

Etihad’s A380 also boasts private first-class compartments with a reclining lounge seat and full-length bed, chilled mini-bar, personal vanity and wardrobe.
