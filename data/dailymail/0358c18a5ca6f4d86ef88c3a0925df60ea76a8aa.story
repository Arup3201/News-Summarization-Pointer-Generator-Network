A family nursed a pair of kittens back to health after they discovered them abandoned in a box in a snowy forest.

The sick kittens were in a polystyrene container when the man drove past and spotted the box which had blended into the snow in America.

He was shocked to discover the sickly pair lying under a blanket next to a bowl of frozen food.

It was lucky the man spotted the box - there are not any houses or through traffic.

The man took the box home and discovered the cat at the front of the box was very ill - his fur was matted with feces and he had an infection around his eyes and nose.

The pair were given a bath and this is when the true extent of their treatment became clear - their skinny bodies were clearly suffering from malnourishment.

Condition: The man took the box home and discovered the cat at the front of the box was very ill - his fur was matted with feces and he had gunk around his eyes and nose

'All this to say: if you’re going to get a cat, make sure you do research first. Cats are a furrever friend. They’re not disposable, despite what the person who abandoned these cats might think,' said the family

Skinny: The pair were given a bath and this is when the true extent of their treatment became clear - their skinny bodies were clearly suffering from malnourishment

The family gave them a bowl of food, but said they kittens did not really know what to do.

The story was documented on Imgur and the family said: 'If you separate them, they meow continuously until they're reunited. They're terrified without each other.

'Her friend is still pretty sick. We're going to be taking them to the vets ASAP. For now we're supplying them with body heat and love!

The kittens are now on the road to recovery and have a bright future ahead of them. 

On the road to recovery: The kittens have recovered well after being treated by a vet

Perplexed: The family gave them a bowl of food, but said the kittens did not really know what to do

Saved: Under the careful treatment of their new owners the cats are getting stronger everyday
