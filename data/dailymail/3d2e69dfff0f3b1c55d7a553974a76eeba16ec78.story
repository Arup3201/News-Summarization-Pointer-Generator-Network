Jose Mourinho broke his silence but had not changed his tune, reiterating his belief that there is a campaign putting pressure on referees to treat Chelsea unfairly.

The Portuguese offered some praise for the work of Premier League officials but claimed they could be swayed by the media and other managers.

Mourinho said he didn’t have a chance of successfully contesting an FA charge for claiming there was a ‘campaign’ against Chelsea after they were denied a penalty in a 1-1 draw against Southampton last month.

Mourinho went through a full range of emotions during his press conference on Friday

Mourinho is said to have berated referee Phil Dowd over his performance in the 5-3 defeat at Tottenham

He is unlikely to be further charged over yesterday’s comments as he appears to be defending his position. ‘Referees are not guilty,’ he said. ‘They want to do their best but clearly there are measures and there are ways of reacting, and with my club and myself there are different standards.’

Mourinho drew on perceived examples, ranging from Arsene Wenger not being given a stadium ban for pushing Mourinho at Stamford Bridge to Eden Hazard not receiving protection from referees.

‘You could say Hazard is a player with more fouls against him than anyone,’ said Mourinho, ‘Chelsea is the team with more attacks and shots and dominance, and with the fewest penalties. That is a big contradiction.

‘Hazard is still the pure, naive boy he was as a kid. For him to go on the floor, it has to be nasty and he has no protection. That is the reality.’

Mourinho also refused to deny telling referee Phil Dowd he was ‘too fat to referee and should retire’ after Chelsea’s 5-3 defeat at Tottenham on New Years Day.

But Mourinho focused his blame on the environment in which referees operate and said: ‘For the players to express themselves they must feel no pressure.

‘With them (referees) it has to be exactly the same thing. They have to enjoy the matches. It is also important for them.

Mourinho added his weight to calls for officials to be able to see live replays of incidents adding that he now felt ‘worried’ every time Chelsea play in a competition without goal line technology.

‘I want them to be able to see replays,’ he said.

‘We can speak to them 30 minutes after the game, sometimes we go and the words are the normal ones: well done and so on. Other times we discuss what happened.

‘With Phil, he made a big mistake and was not happy. I go in a privileged position because I have seen it on TV.’
