Port Augusta police had to use their coaxing skills to try and entice a goat called Sandra down from the roof of a house on Saturday afternoon.

Known for their climbing skills, Sandra was right at home as she frolicked about on the roof of the single storey home in Crichton Drive in Port Augusta, South Australia.

The adventurous animal also climbed onto the flat roof of an adjoining covered area without any concern.

Stuck: Police attended a home in Port Augusta, South Australia to get Sandra the goat off the roof

Police had to get creative with their coaxing methods as the Sandra refused to come down

'On the early hours of Saturday afternoon at about 1.10pm, police were called by neighbours to the house following reports of a goat on a roof,' Inspector Ian Humby told MailOnline.

Insp Humby said because the backyard was raised, the goat was able to jump onto the roof. 'It was feasible that she jumped from the backyard onto the roof,' he said.

As residents of the property were not home at the time police were called, Insp Humby said it was hard to determine how long Sandra had been on the roof for, but he does not believe it was a long time.

With the goat refusing to budge, the police tried using two different types of grass to entice her back down, as reported on the South Australia Police News Facebook page.

Inspt Humby said the officers used hay to bring Sandra down temporarily before she got back onto the roof.

At this point the people living in the home returned and explained to officers they were only looking after the goat for a few days. They also said it was not the first time Sandra had got onto the roof.

'I guess its true when they say goats like heights,' Insp Humby said.

But with the animal back on the roof and refusing to come down, the police improvised by using a makeshift ramp and a lasso made from and old clothes line to bring Sandra back down.

Sandra suffered no injuries and was safely returned to her owner's yard.
