An Oklahoma couple have been accused of child neglect after locking a four-year-old boy in a wire dog crate for up to 14 hours a day.

Suzanne Satterfield, 33, and her boyfriend Jonathon Wade Lee, 31, were jailed on Tuesday on charges of abuse by injury and child neglect.

A social worker who had called at their Chelsea home in October last year found Satterfield's son locked in the cage.

Locked in: The boy was allegedly kept in this dog cage, with the door padlocked, for up to 14 hours a day

Lee allegedly said in a later interview that the couple kept the boy there to stop him harming himself, and when he was being disciplined.

When the child learned how to open the cage door, a padlock and even handcuffs were used to keep the door closed.

Satterfield, who has two older children, told police the punishment was 'a big mistake' and that they 'went too far' according to Tulsa World.

As well as neglect, Lee is also facing 
charges that he sexually abused a 14-year-old girl. His bail has been 
set at $50,000 and Satterfield's was set at $100,000.

According to an arrest affidavit, Lee admitted that for three weeks, his stepson had been locked inside the cage to sleep and during nap times. In all, he would spend up to 14 hours a day in the crate.

Lee claimed the boy's bedroom had 
exposed wires in it and, because the child got up during the night, they
 decided to keep him locked in.

Rogers County Sheriff, Scott Walton told News On 6: 'Fourteen hours is a very, very long period of time. In this situation, 30 minutes is too long. We don't keep kids in cages.'

The boy and his siblings have been placed in protective custody, They allegedly described a fearful atmosphere in the house.
