Police report: Judge Joy Malek Oldfield, of Akron, Ohio, was allegedly found half-naked in a car with a lawyer

A married female judge and lawyer were allegedly found half-naked in the back seat of a vehicle that reeked of alcohol in a car park.

Judge Joy Malek Oldfield, of Akron, Ohio, was found in the back seat of a car with public defender Catherine Loya, 30, on February 5, according to a police report.

An officer claimed as he approached he saw a head look out the back window before two women put their clothes back on.

But Judge Oldfield’s lawyer John Hill said his client was ‘dumbfounded and incredibly upset by this supplement to the police report’.

Judge Oldfield had been socialising with 
her husband Charlie, Ms Loya and other friends on the night, Mr Hill 
told the Akron Beacon Journal.

Mr Oldfield left his wife to go home to their two daughters and their babysitter and arranged for Ms Loya to drive her home, Mr Hill said.

But the couple didn’t think Ms Loya had been drinking. Judge Oldfield had been drinking but wasn’t drunk, according to Mr Hill’s account.

He claimed they were discussing the illness of an Oldfield family member.

There should be a probe to establish if the police report’s allegations were politically motivated or retaliatory, Mr Hill told the Akron Beacon Journal.

But Copley Police Chief Michael Mier defended Officer Thomas Ballinger, who said he approached the car with its headlights on and engine running.

'Our officer was there and I’m satisfied 
that his report is an accurate reflection of what took place'

‘Our officer was there and I’m satisfied that his report is an accurate reflection of what took place,’ Chief Mier told the Akron Beacon Journal.

Judge Oldfield was not charged over the incident but Ms Loya was cited for physical control after refusing to take a breath test for alcohol.

The judge is a former magistrate and was elected in November after unseating incumbent Judge Tom McCarty.
