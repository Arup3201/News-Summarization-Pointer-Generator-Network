A third of male students questioned in a survey admitted they would rape a woman if they could get away with it.

The study found that 31.7 per cent of the mostly white American participants questioned admitted they would force a woman to have sex in a ‘consequence-free situation’.

Academics quizzed volunteers on how they would act in a situation where they could have sex with a woman against her will 'if nobody would ever know there wouldn’t be any consequences’.

But when asked specifically whether they would 'rape' a woman in a consequence-free situation, only 13.6 per cent of the male participants said they would.

The findings suggested that many of those who admitted they would commit rape did not recognise their actions as such, the Independent reports.  

‘Some men will endorse items asking whether they have used force to obtain intercourse, but will deny having raped a woman,’ wrote the authors of the study, which has been published in the scientific journal Violence and Gender. 

The gap in the proportion of people who did not consider their actions as 'rape' and those who would endorse the use of coercion could have implications for sexual education programs, the authors of the report said.

researchers used analysis to 'separate men who do not report intentions to be sexually coercive, those who endorse behaviorally descriptive intentions but deny it when the word rape it used, and those who endorse intentions to rape outright.'

The research was carried out by experts at the University of North Dakota and the North Dakota State University. They questioned 86 people over the age of 18 -most of them college juniors and all of them describing themselves as heterosexual. 

The findings could have knock on effects for educational schemes, the authors suggest, adding: ‘Our results suggest that there is no one-size-fit-all approach to sexual assault prevention.

‘If men who sexually assault harbor different motivations to varying degrees, identifying them ahead of time and targeting interventions toward groups of men with similar motivations, or better even, providing personalized prevention programs, may be more successful.’

It goes on to say that men who show intentions to use force but deny intentions to rape 'exhibit a unique disposition featuring an inverse construct of hostility toward women but high levels of callous sexual attitudes.'

The authors pointed to findings from the National Center for Injury Prevention and Control in 2012 which stated that about one in five women become the victim of sexual assault while in college - with most of the attacks carried out by people known to the victim.
