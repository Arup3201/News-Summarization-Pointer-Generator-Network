The numbers are in and the result is a draw. Well, nearly. Not everybody will be swayed by the evidence. 

The Premier League’s PR department will be quick to insist that the biggest, most important figure of all still points to a very substantial revenue gap between the Premier League and Bundesliga; a gap of £1billion a year.

But here’s the thing. Some things are more important than money.

German supports, like the ones in Borussia Dortmund, feel part of their clubs

The atmosphere in Bundesliga stadiums isn’t just more exciting because the tickets are cheap, beer is freely available and fans can stand. It’s because supporters feel that it is still their club they’re cheering on. 

Staffed and run by people they know, brimming with local talent, owned by no one in particular, and thus belonging to everyone. Commercial pressures notwithstanding, the Bundesliga have been careful to protect the deep emotional ties and sense of identity that are unique to football.

Germans know the product would play much better internationally if they would swap communal ownership for sheiks, American investors or oligarchs. They are unwilling to do that deal. You don’t sell your soul.

Growing organically is a long, arduous process but it’s also a rewarding one. When you can’t take short-cuts to greatness via Abu Dhabi, you have to be more diligent in your work and smarter with your resources. 

In the Bundesliga, football hasn’t forgotten the natural order of things. You get ahead and rich by winning, not the other way round.

For years, Germans would look on with a mixture of horror and envy as turbo-charged English clubs dominated Europe. Now they’re immensely proud that they’ve caught up with the Premier League without compromising their ideals. OK, almost caught up. Maybe we could settle this by penalties?
