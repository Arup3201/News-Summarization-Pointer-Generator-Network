A rare $5 bill presented to the U.S. Vice President in 1905 is expected to sell for a cool $300,000 at auction.

The historic note was given to Charles Fairbanks - Theodore Roosevelt's No. 2 - by the First National Bank of Fairbanks, Alaska, as a memento from the frontier city named after him.

It was one of only four notes of its kind in the $5 denomination that 
were issued by the bank, and has been passed down the generations as a treasured family heirloom.

Change for a five? This rare $5 bill, presented to Vice President Charles Fairbanks in 1905, is expected to sell for around $300,000 at auction

Treasure: The rare note was one of only four of its kind in the $5 denomination that were issued by the bank, and has been passed down the generations as a treasured family heirloom

For decades it took pride of place on the wall of the original owner's great grandson Charles Fairbanks IV, at his home in Santa Barbara, California.

But after learning last year how its value had rocketed, Mr Fairbanks locked it away in a safety deposit box and has now taken the tough decision to put it up for auction.

Charles Warren Fairbanks was a Senator from Indiana from 1897 to 1905 and served as the 26th Vice President of the United States between 1905 and 1909.

The son of a wagon-maker, he was born in a log cabin near Delaware, Ohio. The family home later being used as a hiding place for runaway slaves.Â 

He attended Ohio Wesleyan University, where he co-edited the school newspaper with his future wife Cornelia Cole, before working for the Associated Press, reporting on political rallies.

He moved to Cleveland, Ohio, attending law school before being admitted to the Ohio bar in 1874.

His interest in politics began before the 1888 Republican National Convention, when federal judge Walter Q. Gresham sought his help, in his unsuccessful nomination for U.S. President.

Fairbanks was elected as a Republican to the United States Senate in 1896. He served as a key adviser to McKinley during the Spanish-American War and was Chairman of the Committee on Immigration and the Committee on Public Buildings and Grounds.

In 1898, he was appointed a member of the United States and British Joint High Commission which met in Quebec City for the adjustment of Canadian questions. He was credited with playing a key role to resolve a border dispute with Canada triggered by the Klondike Gold Rush.

Fairbanks was elected Vice President of the United States in 1904 on the Republican ticket with Theodore Roosevelt and served all four years.

He explained: 'Why stress out and worry about something? It'd be like having a Monet in the house.'

The bill is due to be sold at Dallas-based Heritage Auctions as part of the American 
Numismatic Association National Money Show later this month.

A similar note sold for 
close to $100,000 15 years ago and, according to Dustin Johnston, director of Heritage's currency auctions, the market has 'really picked up for the rarest 
pieces'.

Mr Johnson said: 'It's a wonderful, wonderful find

'It's probably one of the better national bank notes that will come to auction over this decade.

'It's easily in the top five of what I've handled.'

Auction officials say the Fairbanks bill that features an image of President Benjamin Harrison is a highlight that's expected to sell for $200,000 to $300,000. The minimum starting bid is $120,000.

Fairbanks learned last year that the uncirculated note's estimated value had risen far beyond the estimate of $50,000 to $60,000 set in the mid-1990s, which prompted him to start locking it up whenever he traveled.

Charles W. Fairbanks was a U.S. senator from Indiana in the late 1890s when he was credited with playing a key role to resolve a border dispute with Canada triggered by the Klondike Gold Rush.

As a result of his efforts, most of the disputed territory went to the United States.

But the real reason the city of Fairbanks was named after him was because he played a key role in the appointment of a federal judge, James Wickersham, a man Fairbanks met during the border dispute, according to University of Alaska Fairbanks historian Terrence Cole.

To return the favor, Wickersham urged city founders to call the settlement Fairbanks.

'He said "I owe everything that I am to him,"'' Cole said.

Auction officials also note the bill's rarity. Only three banks in Alaska - out of more than 12,000 banks nationwide - issued the bills.

A third bill is in storage at the University of Alaska Museum of the North in Fairbanks, collections manager of ethnology and history Angela Linn said Wednesday. The bill is in pristine condition and looks as if it just came off the printing press, she said, adding that its distinctive quirk is a curve in part of the edge.The bill being auctioned is unfolded and there is no wear, either, Johnston said. Its color is a little muted because the family displayed it for so long.

There also have been some minor restorations to the back corners, but Johnston doesn't expect that to affect the selling price, given the bill's rarity, pedigree and history.
