The Cincinnati, Ohio couple charged for abandoning their 9-year-old adoptive son have voluntarily turned themselves into the police.

Cleveland Cox, 49, and his wife Lisa, 52, reported to the county jail Friday night and made $10,000 bail each after being processed.

They are due back in court on November 27 to face misdemeanor charges for giving their 9-year-old adoptive son to Butler County Children Services last month.

On Thursday, sheriff’s deputies made an attempt to arrest the parents, but they were not home. The Ohio couple also reportedly have taken their other two kids from school citing a family emergency.

Adolf Olivas, an attorney appointed by the court to protect the child's legal interests, told the Hamilton-Middletown Journal-News that the parents said the boy behaved aggressively and would not agree to get help.

In August, Mrs Cox filed a report with the local sheriff’s office claiming that her adoptive son suffers from mental issues, and that he threatened to kill everyone in the house with a knife.

‘According to Mrs. Cox [the boy] has outbursts every day but nothing this severe,’ the report stated. ‘Mrs. Cox explained that [the boy] has been hospitalized for these disorders and has been to Children's Hospital in Cincinnati on several occasions.’

The document went on to say that Lisa Cox wanted to take the 9-year-old to a hospital in Dayton and have him evaluated over a period of 72 hours, Dayton Daily News reported.

Not a money problem: The Coxes live in this home
valued at more than $330,000 home in Liberty Township

Warrant: Sheriff's deputies made an attempt to arrest the parents on Thursday, but they were not home

County Prosecutor Michael Gmoser said 
Thursday that he doesn't usually seek indictments in misdemeanor cases 
but views this as an exceptional case.

'When you are the parent and you recklessly abandon a child or children, there are criminal consequences,' Gmoser said.

'These children don't have a return-to-sender stamp emblazoned on their forehead.'

The child is hurt and confused and doesn't understand what is happening, Olivas said.

'If your 9-year-old needs help, you get him help,' Olivas told the newspaper.

Neighbors said the Coxes are good parents and people. One of them described the 9-year-old adopted boy as a 'bad seed.' 

But according to Gosmer, that does not excuse the parents' actions.

‘Children are like that box of 
chocolates, ‘he told WCPO, paraphrasing a famous line from ‘Forrest Gump.’ 
‘You really never know what you're going to get, but u have the 
responsibility, especially if you have the means, to care for them.’

According
to the site AOL Real Estate, the Coxes live in a 4-bedroom, 3-bathroom 
brick house valued at $338,712 in the 8200 block of Windsor Trail. 

'This is not about somebody who can't pay to support the child,' the prosecutor said.

The
median annual income in the region where the parents live is more than 
$100,000, and the median home value is more than $280,000, according to 
census data.

The Coxes could face up to six months in jail and a $1,000 fine if convicted of the first-degree misdemeanor.

They have a hearing in Butler County Juvenile Court November 27.

'These are the only parents he has ever known', Gmoser said.

'What
do you think happens at night when he goes to sleep and doesn't have 
his brothers around or someone to talk to he has known for nine years?'

Attorney Adolf Olivas said that while the 9-year-old is now receiving the care he needs, he doesn’t understand what has happened to him.

Benjamin Johnson, a spokesman for the Ohio Department of Job and Family Services, said such cases are rare.

A
Tennessee woman who ended her adoption of a 7-year-old Russian boy by 
putting him on a plane to Moscow by himself in 2010 lost her bid this 
year to keep from paying $150,000 in child support.

Criminal charges were not filed against the woman, but the Seattle-based adoption agency sued her for support.

She had pinned a note to the boy saying he had violent behavior problems and she no longer wanted to be his mother.

The sheriff's office did not immediately return calls on whether the warrant had been served.
