After catching an octopus, holidaymaker Labros Hydras followed local tradition by killing it and taking it to a taverna to be served for his supper.

That is when he discovered this was no ordinary specimen – it was a ‘hexapus’ with only six legs instead of the usual eight.

The creature found during a snorkelling trip in Greece is believed to be only the second recorded worldwide.

Catch: Labros Hydras his daughter Areti, ten, and son Arion, six admire the six legged octopus or hexapus which they found while on holiday in Greece

Fishing: The specimen was pulled from the sea by US citizen Labros Hydras as he went snorkelling in Greece

Hexapus: The chef refused to cook it for him but he fried it himself and served it with tomato and lemon

Father-of-two Mr Hydras, 49, took it to a local taverner where a chef cooked it and served it with tomato, lemon and a lettuce leaf.

It was only then that he checked with a friend who is a biologist – and felt sick at what he had done.

The first known hexapus was found off North Wales in 2008 and taken to Blackpool Sea Life Centre.

Nicknamed Henry, he was then released back into the sea where he has 
probably died of natural causes as their maximum life span is five 
years.

A repentant Mr Hydras said: ‘It tasted just like a normal octopus but now I feel really bad.

‘When we caught it, there was nothing to suggest it was any different or had been damaged.

‘I thought it had been born with six tentacles. We go to Greece every 
year and when we catch an octopus, we do the same thing so we just did 
not think about it.

‘I wanted to find out more, but there was no internet where we were. I 
then called my friend who is a biologist and he told me it was true and I
 was horrified.’

Mr Hydras, who was born in Greece but is now a US 
citizen living in Washington DC, caught the hexapus with his daughter 
Areti, ten, and son Arion, six, off the Pelion peninsula.

The mechanical engineer has given details to the Hellenic  Centre for 
Marine Research in Athens to increase awareness of the wild hexapus.

Tentacles: it was only the second hexapus ever found, the first being in Wales

Holiday: The family inspect the hexapus before killing and eating it

‘It is the least that I can do given my ignorance and guilt that I feel 
for killing such a rare  animal,’ he said. Biologists said the hexapus 
is the result of a natal abnormality in a common octopus (octopus 
vulgaris), not a new species.

Professor Matt Bentley, a marine biology expert at Newcastle University, said: ‘It is rare to find an octopus like this.

‘There is every possibility it could have grown an abnormality in early development.

‘There is nothing to suggest it is a different species. Another explanation is it could have been injured and healed over time.’

Day out: The family travel to Greece every year and frequently catch and cook wild octopi

Catch of the day: Labros's son Arion holds the six legged octopus or hexapus

Henry the Hexapus was found in 2008

Henry was found off the coast of North Wales in 2008 in a lobster pot and was the first six-tentacled octopus found.

He was named after King Henry VIII, who had six wives.

He was held at Blackpool Sea Life Centre, northern England, and was an attraction in an exhibit named Suckers.

It is thought that his tentacles are a result of a natural abnormality, and he was not involved in an accident.

After being taken from the sea, he was transferred to the Anglesey Sea Zoo, Wales, which, in turn, donated him to the Blackpool Centre.

He is thought to have been the first of his kind.

The Centre's displays supervisor Carey Duckhouse said at the time: 'We've scoured the internet and talked to lots of other aquariums and no-one has ever heard of another case of a [hexapus].'
