Connecticut police have charged twin sisters with drunken driving in separate incidents.

It's been said that a twin experiences the feelings and sensations the other one is going through - though in this case telepathy wasn't necessary, because 25-year-old Hannah Murphy was arrested for drunken driving less than 24 hours after her sister Kathleen Murphy.

Stonington police say they arrested Kathleen Murphy of Stonington at 1:49 a.m. on Saturday after her car backed into another at the Hootie's Good Times Cafe, a local bar in Pawcatuck.

She was charged with a slew of offenses, including unsafe driving, DUI, unsafe backing, improper use of markers, driving without minimum insurance and failure to register a motor vehicle eligible for commercial registration.

Her identical twin sister, Hannah Murphy, was arrested at 1:46 a.m. on Sunday after her car struck a sign on Latimer Point Road and she left the scene.

She was charged with driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs, evading responsibility and failure to drive on the right, reports the Courant.

There is no listed phone number for the sisters, who share the same address in Stonington.

It was not immediately clear if either had hired an attorney.

They are both scheduled to appear in New London Superior Court on June 17.

According to their Facebook accounts, Hannah Murphy is studying dental hygiene at Ridley Lowell Business and Technical Institute.

Her sister Kathleen studies occupational therapy at the New England Institute of Technology.
