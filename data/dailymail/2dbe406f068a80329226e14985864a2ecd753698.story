Missing: Eliza Delacruz, who is three weeks old and weighs 10lbs, went missing on Saturday after a shooting at her family's home in Long Beach, California

Sunday afternoon, a baby's body was found in a dumpster two hours south in Imperial beach, California, near the Mexican border. Detectives are working to identify whether the baby is Eliza

A man was reportedly sifting through a shopping center dumpster around 1:25pm when he came across a trash bag containing the body and called police. 

Imperial Beach is less than 20 minutes from the U.S.-Mexico border. 

Earlier in the day Sunday, police asked the public's help in finding missing Eliza, saying at the time that they don't know who took the 10-pound baby girl, but that the kidnapping did not appear to be random. 

Baby Eliza was first reported missing Saturday night, just after 6pm, when police responded to calls of a shooting at the family's home on the 100 block of West 51st Street in Long Beach. 

'I heard two shots. No noises, nothing else,' neighbor Maria Rodriguez told NBC Los Angeles.  

Who took her? Baby Eliza's parents and uncle were injured in the shooting at the family's Long Beach, California home. Police believe the baby girl was kidnapped by the shooter. Above, an officer pictured near the scene of the crime after the Saturday night shooting 

They believe the suspect ran off with the baby, and hope someone has information which will lead them to the kidnapped girl.

Arrona says it appears the kidnapping was not random since there is no sign of forced entry at the house.

Neighbors say several family members live at the home; police added that they will be looking into the backgrounds of the residents at the address.

The child's parents and uncle have not yet been able to give police a detailed description of the suspect. 

The suspect has only been described as an Hispanic or African-American male. 

'We believe this is not a random act,' Lt Lloyd Cox said. 'It appears to be very personal. Whoever came here for it, based on limited info, it was not a random act to kidnap an infant from.' 

As of Sunday, the child's father had been released from the hospital, but the man's wife and brother were still listed in critical but stable condition. Both underwent surgery for their injuries. 

He did not speak with reporters as he was checked out of the hospital. 

Anyone with information is urged to call the LAPD on 565-435-6711.

Attack: Police were called to the property at 6pm on Saturday to find three people critically wounded
