A Florida man was arrested Tuesday after authorities say he fatally shot a man , as well as shooting a 7-year-old boy - thankfully, the boy lived.

Brandon Hawkins has a long history of problems with his girlfriend's family, but according to investigators, what finally pushed him over the edge was a sandwich from a Port St. Lucie Burger King.

'The wrong sandwich was just another stressor in an already tense situation,' Port St. Lucie Police Chief John Bolduc told reporters on Wednesday.

Earlier this week Florida man Brandon Hawkins  was arrested for allegedly shooting a man because he got the wrong order at Burger King

Authorities say Hawkins' relationship with Jamie Young has been strained recently, and the issues he's had with her family has been equally problematic.

About a year ago, Young's brother fired a gun at Hawkins, police say, and on Tuesday Hawkins had gone to Young's home looking for her brother.

'There's a long history in the family of gunplay,' Port St. Lucie Police Lt. Scott Beck told WPBF.

About 7 p.m. on Tuesday evening, police say Hawkins went to Young's home with a plan to kill her brother and than take his own life.

Things didn't go according to plan.

Rather than shooting Young's brother, Hawkins ended up shooting her mother's boyfriend, 69-year-old Levy Williams, and Young's 7-year-old son, Emmanuel Morgan Jr. as he and his mother tried to run to a neighbor's house to avoid the gunfire.

Williams died at a local hospital, and Morgan currently is in stable condition. Young was not injured in the attack.Â 

According to detectives, Hawkins showed no remorse when he was told Williams was dead.

Neighbors and other witnesses described a chaotic scene at the home.

'The first couple (of shots) sounded more like fireworks, then all of a 
sudden a few minutes later, I could hear, "Pow, pow, pow, pow,'" said a 
neighbor who preferred to remain anonymous.

Hawkins remained on the loose for several hours after the shooting, causing residents in the neighborhood to fear that he could attack them next.

'When they said he was still on the loose, I said we better lock all our
 doors and windows because we don't know where he's hiding,' neighbor Samori Williams told the local news station. 'He could be in anybody's backyard. It's no joke; anybody can hide.'

Detectives tracked Hawkins down at another girlfriend's house a few miles away from the crime scene at about 1 a.m.

Hawkins was booked into the St. Lucie County Jail about 5:30 a.m. on several felony charges, including first-degree murder.

He's been ordered held without bail.
