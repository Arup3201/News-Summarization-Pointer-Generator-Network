An estate agent was so fed up with the potholes scarring the streets of his city he decided to fill one himself - with a small tree.

Kurt Flock from Indianapolis, Indiana, was sick of seeing no action despite repeatedly reporting potholes to the city's online reporting system.

So he took a pot plant, wandered out to the middle of Massachusetts Avenue, and planted the thing right in the middle of the street.

Vigilante road repair: Kurt Flock walks out with the small tree he has chosen to beautify Massachusetts Avenue

Guerilla gardening: Having placed the plant into the pothole, he adds more soil to keep it in place

Good job! Mr Flock stops to admire his handiwork, which has at once repaired the hole and brightened up the city

My work here is done: Mr Flock strides away, and into infamy as city officials take offence to his public-spiritedness

After getting a friend to film the vigilante road repair, he turned the video into a mock campaign film exhorting fellow citizens to 'adopt a pothole' and fill in some of the many which are plaguing the city.

But officials were not impressed with Mr Flock's film, and have threatened him with legal action unless he agrees to remove references to city hall from the online clip.

Mr Flock's stunt comes as Indianapolis is in the midst of a pothole crisis.

A particularly severe winter has ravaged the city's streets and while, the city has approved $8million to repair roads, that's well short of the $24million its estimated is needed.

So the parody video appears to have touched a rather raw nerve with city officials.

Mr Flock told wthr.com reporter Mary Milz: 'There wasn't a lot of thought behind it. There was a pothole and a plant and I thought this might be fun.'

Mr Flock's video urges fellow citizens to 'adopt a pothole', with a message that reads: 'Volunteers pitch in to fill $16million funding gap in Indy's lame pot hole repair program.

'Citizens are planting shrubs and trees in intersections & streets throughout the city.

'Mayor Ballard & City County Council leaders lauded the effort as a fine example of the public/private partnerships that make Indy a great place to live.'

It then shows the scene as Mr Flock walks out into the middle of Massachusetts Avenue and plants a small tree in a deep pothole close to a junction.

It again exhorts viewers to 'adopt a pothole today!' before adding the phone number for the Mayor's Action Centre and the web address of the city's pothole reporting service.

Mr Flock said of the film: 'I was clearly having fun, but this is a serious issue.'

That final message that is the one that has irked Indianapolis council officials. They say it implies that the parody is in fact a real, council-sponsored campaign and they have ordered Mr Flock to take it down.

But he remains steadfast: 'I'm not going to take it down. If they put me in jail for civil disobedience, hopefully something good happens.'
