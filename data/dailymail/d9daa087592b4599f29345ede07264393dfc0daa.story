Julie Bailey exposed horrific neglect at an NHS hospital and has been honoured with a CBE

A whistleblower who exposed horrific neglect at an NHS hospital is honoured with a CBE today.

Julie Bailey was forced to flee her home town and sell her business following death threats after she revealed her mother’s appalling treatment at Stafford Hospital, where neglect cost up to 1,400 lives.

She started the pressure group Cure the NHS to campaign for better care and helped to force an official inquiry into failings at the hospital.

But Miss Bailey faced abuse and hate mail herself after she was wrongly blamed for the closure of local healthcare services.

She said her CBE was ‘an important acknowledgement of our struggle for a better NHS’ and dedicated it to the memory of her mother Bella, who died at Stafford in 2007.

Miss Bailey said: ‘I am certain that my Mum would be extremely proud of me and it is to her I dedicate not only this award but also our continuing struggle for a safer health service.’

The mother-of-two’s campaign came at great personal cost and she was forced to leave her home and move into a static caravan to escape threats against her.

She has since moved abroad and hopes to launch Cure the NHS as a national charity, to maintain pressure for better standards of care.

The Francis Inquiry into serious failings at Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust highlighted ‘appalling and unnecessary suffering of hundreds of people’ and made 290 recommendations for change.

Miss Bailey told inquiry chair Robert Francis QC that patients were left ‘screaming out’ in pain on chaotic and under-staffed wards.

 mother was admitted for a routine hernia operation but died of heart 
failure after being dropped by a healthcare assistant, the public 
inquiry heard.

Miss Bailey said she still faced ‘ongoing denial and indifference’ in her campaign.

Speaking
 as her CBE was revealed, she said: ‘I could have achieved nothing 
without the crucial support of the members of Cure the NHS who provide 
me with the strength and support to stand up to the ongoing denial and 
indifference that I still face from some.

‘We will continue to push for full 
implementation of the Francis Report in 2014, including minimum staffing
 levels and legal protection for whistleblowers, to ensure that our 
loved ones did not suffer in vain.’

Jimmy was killed in May 2008, the day after his 16th birthday

Miss
 Bailey was one of almost 1,200 people honoured for work in their local 
communities, who accounted for 74 per cent of the awards.

The parents of murdered schoolboy Jimmy Mizen received MBEs for their campaign to inform teenagers about the consequences of violent crime.

Jimmy was killed in May 2008, the day after his 16th birthday, and his parents Barry and Margaret set up a foundation in his name and visit schools and prisons to speak to teenagers and young offenders.

Mr Mizen said Jimmy’s whole family were now involved in the campaign, saying: ‘We weren’t expecting anything at all like this. We’re really chuffed.

‘It’s in memory of a fine and decent young lad whose legacy will be one of peace and community cohesion.’ 

Head of the civil service Sir Bob Kerslake said it was vital that the New Year’s Honours list should reflect the work of community stalwarts.

He said: ‘People think the honours system is not for them, that it’s not something they can aspire to, but it is open to everyone.’

Others honoured included Christina Selby, who has sent almost 10,000 knitted hats - each containing a chocolate bar - to British forces in Afghanistan to boost morale.

She founded Hats4Heroes in 2010 and 
will receive the British Empire Medal, an award which was reintroduced 
in the 2012 Queen’s Birthday Honours to recognise community service.

Postmistress
 Diane Bell, who set up shop in her living room after her local Post 
Office closed in 1977, will receive the same award.

The 63-year-old works more than 55 hours a week to provide vital services for her local community in Nettleton, Wiltshire.

Mrs Bell and husband Frank, 68, have kept the shop in their living room open five days a week for the last 36 years. She said she was ‘amazed and gobsmacked’ by her award.

Three mothers who founded website Netmums in 2000 all received OBEs. It is now Britain’s biggest parenting site.
