Veteran Newsnight host Jeremy Paxman, pictured, led a furious backlash by blaming 'cowards and incompetents' for George Entwistle's downfall

Jeremy Paxman provoked fears he will quit Newsnight as the BBC2 programme's chances of survival appeared to be fading last night.

The fiery presenter blamed 'cowards and incompetents' for the departure of director general George Entwistle as he damned a culture of 'timeserving' and 'biddable' managers.

His embittered response raised fears that he will leave the programme, where he is known for his combative questioning and refusal to tolerate evasive politicians.

Even staff on the programme are beginning to question whether it will be able to survive the crisis.

One BBC insider asked whether, following two separate reviews into the programme, 'it would be the kind of brand you want to be associated with'.

Others believe a brief suspension is possible – until at least after Christmas – while the mess is cleared up and a new team installed.

Former Newsnight presenter Peter Snow said last night: 'It is a brilliant programme. It produces wonderful stuff and has done successfully for 32 years. To end Newsnight would be absurd. But I'm afraid Newsnight have made mistakes and of course they are going to have to suffer for that.'

Yesterday BBC chairman Lord Patten admitted that Newsnight could be axed, saying he would be discussing its future with acting director general Tim Davie.

He did concede, however, that it would be 'sad' if the BBC stopped screening current affairs in the 10.30pm Monday to Friday slot on BBC2 – leading to speculation a new programme is being considered.

Newsnight has already been wounded by its decision not to air an investigation it commissioned last year into the criminal activities of the late Jimmy Savile.

Last month, following a decision by ITV to screen the allegations, Newsnight editor Peter Rippon 'stepped aside' pending the outcome of a review by Nick Pollard.

That report is due within weeks but 
many believe the error in broadcasting false allegations on November 2 
that a leading Tory participated in child abuse at a North Wales 
children's home could prove a fatal blow for the show.

BBC
insiders have been left staggered that the show's acting editor Liz 
Gibbons and duty lawyers did not insist that the claims by former care 
home resident Stephen Messham were put to Lord McAlpine.

Radio 5 Live controller Adrian van Klaveren – installed as an overseer after Mr Rippon stepped aside – had signed off the programme's script 24 hours before it was broadcast. But it has also emerged that Mr Messham was not even shown a picture of the innocent Lord McAlpine to confirm whether or not he was his alleged attacker.

Following Mr Entwistle's departure on Saturday, Paxman, the face of the programme since 1989, said the director general – a former Newsnight editor – has been 'sacrificed'.

The 62-year-old said: 'George Entwistle's departure is a great shame. He has been brought low by cowards and incompetents. The real problem here is the BBC's decision, in the wake of the Hutton Inquiry, to play safe by appointing biddable people.

'They then compounded the problem by enforcing a series of cuts on programme budgets, while bloating the management.

'That is how you arrive at the current mess on Newsnight. I very much doubt the problem is unique to that programme. I had hoped that George might stay to sort this out. 

'It is a great pity that a talented man has been sacrificed. While time-servers prosper.'

Last night a source close to Paxman said speculation about his leaving the show was 'inevitable' but denied he would go.

Labour
MP Ben Bradshaw, who sits on the Culture select committee, said: ‘I 
agree with Jeremy Paxman and think this a terrible mistake.’

He too blamed ‘BBC news managers’ for the crisis, and said Mr Entwistle had been ‘hung out to dry’.

He said: ‘George Entwistle has been grossly, grossly let down by BBC News managers and the people around him.

Some top BBC names lamented the demise of George Entwistle, but others took a different view.

It took BBC Radio 5 Live presenter Victoria Derbyshire only 13 minutes from Mr Entwistle’s announcement before she tweeted: ‘Finally.’

She has previously rounded on her bosses over the Savile crisis, asking on Twitter whether all journalists would be treated as badly as Newsnight editor Peter Rippon if they, like him, made poor editorial judgments.

Adam Smyth, editor of radio news at BBC Northern Ireland, mentioned rival Fox News, owned by Rupert Murdoch, when he tweeted in jest: ‘I’m going to tell everyone I work for Fox. Less embarrassing.’

‘I was one of those MPs who quizzed 
him about the Newsnight Savile inquiry a couple of weeks ago, and we 
gave him a very hard time and I told him he had to get a grip. I am not 
confident anyone else could have done a better job. Who else is going to
clear up this mess?’

‘He
has been done a real injustice. He was only in the job for seven weeks.
As Lord Patten said George Entwistle understood what needed to be done 
at the BBC to sort out the total dysfunctionality which is clearly in 
the BBC and its news management and he was doing that.’

The future of Newsnight is in doubt following former director-general George Entwistle's resignation.

The announcement came after he admitted he did not know beforehand that Newsnight planned to broadcast allegations linking a senior Tory to the abuse scandal at a North Wales children's home.

The allegations have since been exposed as defamatory and false.

Asked whether Newsnight could now survive, Lord Patten told Sky's Murnaghan programme: 'That's one of the things we will be discussing with the acting director-general today.

'I think one of the things that should survive is the investigative journalism which it has represented along with Panorama.

'At the heart of our news offering has to be uncompromising investigative journalism but you have to get it right.'
