Beheaded American journalist Steven Sotloff was not 'sold' to the Islamic State by Syrian rebels, the White House said on Tuesday.

'Based on the information that has been provided to me, I don't believe that is accurate,' White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest told reporters during his daily briefing.  

'That information does not match the information that I’m currently aware of,' Earnest claimed, according to the Washington Examiner. 

The Obama administration official's statements contradict a claim made Monday night by Sotloff family spokesman Barak Barfi. Barfi told CNN's Anderson Cooper that 'sources on the ground' had confirmed Sotloff was kidnapped at the Syrian border and sold to ISIS for as much as $50,000.

Barak Barfi also accused the White House of not doing enough to save the American journalist, who is pictured here on the day he was murdered

'These so-called moderate rebels that people want us, our administration, to support, one of them sold him probably for something between $25,000 - $50,000,' he said, getting in a dig at other U.S. politicians in favor of backing Syrian rebels, including Republican Sen. John McCain and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.

According to Barfi, Sotloff's name was wrongly included on a list of activists responsible for the bombing of a hospital. 

While at the border crossing, Barfi says, someone made a phone call to ISIS, and Sotloff was later apprehended at a fake check point. 

The White House said on Tuesday that 'there is a broad investigation into Mr. Sotloff’s death' still.

'We are determined to bring those responsible for his death to justice,' Earnest added.

Barfi accused the White House on Monday of using the beheaded journalist as a ‘pawn’ and failing to do more to save him after he went missing in August of 2013.

The Sotloff family spokesman said it ‘not true’ that the White House kept the families of Americans taken hostage in Syria ‘consistently and regularly informed’ and claimed that the family’s relationship with the White House was ‘strained’ even before their son was killed.

'We do not believe that they gave us the cooperation we need,' Barfi said. 'Once Steve appeared in that video, the Sotloff family made one simple request of the administration, and they were rebuffed on that.'

On September 2, 2014, extremists affiliated with the Islamic State released an undated video of Sotloff being beheaded by a masked man. Government officials confirmed hours later that the man who was murdered in the video was indeed Sotloff.

Sotloff is the second American journalist ISIS has murdered on camera. The first was James 'Jim' Foley, who was beheaded in an undated video released by ISIS in August.

Fearing public outrage over the two atrocities, Obama administration officials told the press about a failed mission to rescue Sotloff and Foley. 

Barfi pushed back on Monday on administration officials' claims that the government did everything it could to save the two men and warned that the Sotloff family would have 'to speak out to set the record straight' if administration officials continued to 'leak' information to the press.

'We know that the intelligence community and the White House are [immersed] in a larger game of bureaucratic infighting and Jim and Steve are pawns in that game, and that's not fair,' he said.

Barfi said it was inappropriate for the White House and Pentagon officials to be arguing publicly about the details of a failed mission to retrieve Americans being held hostage in Syria and said they should not be detailing how Foley was tortured before he was killed.

'That's just not fair to his family. They need time to heal,' he said.

Barfi told CNN’s Anderson Cooper on Monday that it was ‘not true’ that the White House kept the Sotloff family ‘consistently and regularly informed’

The Sotloff family spokesman told Cooper he could not say what favor the Sotloffs had asked of the president before their own son was killed because he had to 'think about protecting the other hostages inside.'

Suffice it to say 'the administration could have done more, they could have helped us, they could have seen them through,' Barfi claimed.

'These are people of modest means. They are not cosmopolitans. They don't have college educations. They don't understand the larger ramifications in foreign policy,' he continued. 'And we just do not believe that they were afforded the opportunities and respect that they should have by this administration.'

Barfi said that in future hostage situations, the government needs to designate a senior administration official as the point of contact 'so that the families know there is someone to hold their hand all the time.'
