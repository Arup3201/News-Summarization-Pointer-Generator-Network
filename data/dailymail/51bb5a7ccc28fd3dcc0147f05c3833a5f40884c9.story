The parents of a severely-epileptic boy have found a life-altering treatment for his painful syndrome.

Kim and Chris Clark's son Caden was diagnosed with Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome, an illness which causes the 10-year-old boy to suffer 10 to 100 seizures a day.

But after moving to Colorado, Caden can now go days without a single seizure thanks to a special strain of marijuana called Charlotte's Web, named after the famous children's book.

Over the years, the Clarks have tried over 20 drugs, a brain lobectomy and extreme diets to treat Caden's syndrome but still the seizures persisted.

Wonder drug: Caden and his mother moved to Colorado from Georgia so they could use a special strain of medical marijuana called Charlotte's Web, which other families have found helpful in limiting seizures with their children

They were running out of hope last year, when Caden reached 'expiration age, a point at which the seizures become increasingly frequent and deadly.

That's when they heard about the revolutionary strain of medical marijuana oil that was being used to treat other children like Caden.

Charlotte's Web was developed five years ago by Colorado company Realm of Caring, as a drug for cancer patients.

The strain was once called 'Hippie's Disappointment' since it doesn't get users high, due to a lower amount of THC and higher amount of cannabidoil (CBD).

Medical authorities still have not found conclusive evidence that CBD limits seizures, but the Clarks have seen the good it can do after just one month.

Chris Clark was hesitant to give his child the drug at first, however, since he has worked for the Atlanta Police Department for 26 years and currently is in charge of their drug evidence inventory.

'I was real nervous about what my peers would think about me doing this,' Mr Clark told the Guardian. 'I finally came to the conclusion that if there is a chance that this product could help my child, then you've got to do it.'

Hesitation: Mr Clark was hesitant to use the drug on his son at first, since he has worked in law enforcement for the last 26 years and currently is in charge of the Atlanta Police Department's drug evidence inventory. But They tried Charlotte's Web as a last ditch effort and saw improvement almost immediately. Mrs Clark (left) says her son (right) can now go days without a seizure

Mrs Clark moved to Colorado Springs with Caden and his 13-year-old brother Jackson in December while Mr Clark stayed at home to continue to work.

The Clarks put Caden on a waiting list and were cleared to start using Charlotte's Web for the first time on May 31.

They noticed an instant improvement since Caleb could go whole days without a single seizure.

In April, Mrs Clark spoke with Atlanta news station WSB-TV over Skype, detailing how her son's improving quality of life.

'He's not having hundreds of seizures in the last week. He's had seven. It's huge for us,' she said. 'And that may not last. We're not saying it's a miracle cure, but it means a world of difference for us.'

Today, more than 400 families are using Charlotte's Web to treat their seizure-prone condition and thousands more are on a waiting list.

Many, like the Clarks, have found the drug to be useful, but others have not been so lucky.

Mrs Clark says she knows a few families who have left Colorado after the drug failed to help their children. And doctors at Children's Hospital Colorado say some patients have had negative experiences using the drug, and been submitted to the intensive care unit/

Dr Orrin Devinsky, who runs the NYU Epilepsy Center, is one of the doctors who has started early testing of the drug in its use with children.

'It's common for people hearing incredibly wonderful anecdotal stories to feel like they know the answer, and no one should like today, based on the data, that anyone has any of the answers about safety or efficacy,' Dr Devinsky told the Guardian.
