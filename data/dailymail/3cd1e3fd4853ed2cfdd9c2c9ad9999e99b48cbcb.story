A guitarist who claimed £23,000 in benefits was caught after he was seen on video playing with JLS. 

Joseph Ross, of Walsall, failed to tell the Department of Work and Pensions that he had found work and earned thousands performing all over the world as well as for The X Factor and Strictly Come Dancing.

The father of five, who is due to tour with Cheryl Fernandez-Versini next year, was spotted on Youtube performing with JLS on the Xtra Factor on ITV2 and admitted receiving £22,810 that he wasn't entitled to.

Ross started claiming benefits three years ago. Despite being presented the Black Entertainment, Film, Fashion, Television and Arts Excellence Award for his role at the highest level in the music industry for 26 years last year in recognition for his work, he still continued to falsely claim benefits.

At a hearing at Walsall Magistrates Court he admitted receiving £22,810 in overpayments that he was not entitled to.

He was sentenced to 26 weeks in prison, suspended for a year, and is attempting to pay back the money. So far he has repaid £400. 

Ross has played alongside R Kelly, Lemar, S Club 7, Gareth Gates, Eternal, MKS, Gabrielle, Joss Stone, Patti LaBelle, Jamelia, Coolio, Notorious BIG, Shola Ama, and Mark Morrison and also claims to have performed at the London 2012 Olympics.

On a web profile advertising his services as a musician and band leader he claims to have been hired by the Beckhams, Marvin and Rochelle Humes and current Strictly star Frankie Bridge from The Saturdays.

He told the court he had had financial difficulties and was going through a divorce at the time.

Ross admitted falsely claiming almost £23,000 in jobseekers allowance despite working as a guitarist 

Ross had failed to tell the Department of Work and Pensions that he was now able to work as a guitarist 

Ross told magistrates: 'I did sign off when I got the main bulk of work again.'

Ian Henery, defending, said Ross had been the victim of bad luck but had recently landed the chance to perform with Cheryl Fernandez-Versini. 

He said: 'He has five children and was left with debts. And yes, he made a lot of money. But all that money went on paying his band and on the divorce.

Ross, 44, received a Black Entertainment, Film, Fashion, Television and Arts Excellence Award last year but continued to claim jobseekers allowance

After he signed off he went on tour with JLS. He has worked with Girls Aloud and made a lot of money working for them for two years.

'He has been offered a tour with Cheryl Fernandez-Versini that will make him £25,000. He has paid back £400 so far.

'He needs to be in a position where he can pay back all the money to taxpayers.

'My client was seen performing with JLS on YouTube. He's had payments from the likes of X Factor, Sony Entertainment, and BBC's Strictly Come dancing.

'He is highly regarded in the industry, but the divorce left him high and dry financially.' 

Ross admitted an offence of making a false statement to the Department of Work and Pensions, and two offences of failing to notify Walsall Council of a change in his circumstances.

The benefit cheat was given a suspended prison sentence for claiming Jobseekers Allowance, council tax and housing benefit he was not meant to have between June 2011 and October 2013.

Chairman of the bench Mr Ajmir Dhaliwal jailed him for a total of 26 weeks suspended for 12 months with supervision. Ross must complete the 20-day benefit fraud workbook course, pay £85 costs and £80 victims' surcharge.

Martin Ball, from West Midlands Probation Service, told the magistrates: 'He has worked as a musician for a number of years he understands that he should have declared that he was working.

'He says he did discuss this with the Jobcentre at that point before he was interviewed.

'The money he received was being paid to other musicians as part of the band.'
