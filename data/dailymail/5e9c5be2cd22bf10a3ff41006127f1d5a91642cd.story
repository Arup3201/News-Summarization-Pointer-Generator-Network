The cowboy hat worn by John Wayne in six of his westerns is going up for auction for £17,000.

The actor, who appeared in more than 170 films, gave it to his stunt double Chuck Roberson after working together for more than 30 years.

The inner rim of the hat is marked with his name handwritten in black pen, and the underside of the lip says ‘John Wayne Comancheros’.

It was worn by Wayne - nicknamed The Duke - in the 1960s movie The Comancheros, as well as in El Dorado and The Undefeated.

When Mr Roberson died in 1988 his collection was sold. The current owner is putting up for auction next Tuesday at Nate D Sanders in Los Angeles.

Auction manager Laura Yntema said: ‘The hat not only has cinematic value but personal value too.

‘John Wayne was famously known for being close to the people he worked with and he was known for being rather generous towards his friends.

Headgear: It was also seen in the 1967 film El Dorado, in which Wayne starred with Robert Mitchum

‘Chuck Roberson worked with Wayne as his stunt double for such a long time that he probably decided to give it to him as a gift.

Laura Yntema, auction manager

‘It is made of felt and has his name handwritten inside, which would have been done by the wardrobe department just to identify who it belonged to.

‘Chuck died in 1988 and afterwards I'm sure his collection was sold and the hat was bought by a private collector who is now selling it.

‘Hats have a nostalgic element to them because we don't wear them any more and they also look very nice on display. It will probably be purchased by a fan or an institution.’
