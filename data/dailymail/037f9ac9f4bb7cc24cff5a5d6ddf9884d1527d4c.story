Detectives investigating the gangland execution of a dancer who appeared in a video with X Factor judge Tulisa Contostavlos have charged three men with his murder.

Reece James Menzies was shot dead after a gang burst into a flat last month and fired a bullet into his head.

The 21-year-old, known as Stylie, had recently travelled 100 miles from his home in Wembley, North West London, to Boscombe in Bournemouth, Dorset.

His body was found at around 2.30am on Wednesday, July 25, at an address in Roumelia Lane.

A spokesman for Dorset Police said: 
'Detectives investigating the alleged murder of a man in Bournemouth 
have charged three men in connection with his death following the advice
of the Crown Prosecution Service.

'Three London men, aged 22, 24 and 33,
have been charged with the murder of Reece James Menzies and will 
appear before Bournemouth Magistrates’ Court tomorrow morning.'

The three men were arrested at addresses in London and Folkestone, Kent, on Tuesday morning.

Detective Chief Inspector Kevin 
Connolly, of the Major Crime Investigation Team, said: 'The three men 
have been in custody for the last 72 hours and they have all been 
interviewed at length.

'We have presented details of these 
interviews as well as evidence gathered over the past month to the Crown
Prosecution Service, with whom we have worked closely.

'Although I cannot go into any further
detail, I continue to appeal for witnesses and anyone with information 
to come forward and help us with this investigation.'

Controversial: Tulisa denied suggestions she 
referenced the Church Road Soldiers gang in this video, which also 
starred Reece James

X Factor judge Tulisa had appeared 
alongside the victim in a controversial music video, in which she made a
'C' shape with her hand - the gang sign of local mob the Church Road 
Soldiers.

The former N-Dubz singer explained the gesture as a reference to her birthplace - Camden.

Detectives had previously released 
CCTV images of a car they believed was used by the assassins in what 
they described as a 'major breakthrough in the case'.

A silver Audi A3 saloon - captured on 
CCTV - was driving from nearby Christchurch Road into St John’s Road 
toward the scene of the murder, in Roumelia Lane, where Reece was gunned
down, at around 1.30am on July 25.
