Home Secretary Theresa May wants security services to be able to snoop on email and internet records, but Nick Clegg is seeking to delay the Communications Data Bill

Water and power firms are being targeted by foreign countries launching cyber attacks against Britain.

The services ‘upon which daily life depends’ risk being disrupted by hackers working for the UK's enemies, officials claimed.

Internet terrorism from ‘hostile foreign states’ is now one of the top four threats Britain faces.

The scale of the problem comes as Home Secretary Theresa May stepped up her call for more powers to track email and internet use.

She claimed people will ‘die’ without more powers to track terrorists, paedophiles and criminals online.

A major Coalition split was laid bare as Mrs May took a swipe at Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg for blocking new internet powers to break up criminal plots on sites like Facebook and Skype.

The £2billion law – dubbed a snoopers charter - would store billions of pieces of private information from emails, Facebook, texts and internet use.

In a thinly-veiled swipe at her Cabinet colleague, Mrs May said opponents of her legislation are 'putting politics before people’s lives’.

Mr Clegg wants to delay the Communications Data Bill until 2014 to strike a balance between security and liberty’.

But Mrs May said: ‘The people who say they’re against this bill need to look victims of serious crime, terrorism and child sex offences in the eye and tell them why they’re not prepared to give the police the powers they need to protect the public.

‘We would certainly see criminals going free as a result of this. There will be paedophiles who will not be identified and it will reduce our ability to deal with this serious organised crime,’ she told The Sun.

Mrs May suggested 
the new laws were needed to prevent a repeat of the 7/7 London bombings 
or the shootings of two female police officers in Manchester in 
September.

‘The
 shootings of Nicola Hughes and Fiona Bone brought everybody up sharp to
 show the extent of the problem that can be caused by criminals.

‘It
 would be harder for us to crack into organised crime gangs, and yes we 
could see people dying as a result of not being able to have access to 
this information.’

Mrs May said opponents of her Communications Data Bill had to 'look victims of terrorism in the eye', like those caught up in the 7/7 London bombings

She went on: 'Criminals, terrorists and paedophiles will want MPs to vote against this bill.

'Victims of crime, police and the public will want them to vote for it. It's a question of whose side you're on.'

However, a committee of MPs and peers is
 expected to issue damning criticism of the measures this week, arguing 
ministers have not made the case that is really needed.

The Home Office insists the proposed storage of website visits for 12 months, along with use of Skype and even online games consoles, will protect national security.

Without it, police and the security services will lose their ability to track the activities of crime gangs and paedophiles over time, they argue.

Officials warn that new technology will allow terrorists to hatch plots or swap sickening images. Gaps in coverage already mean the authorities have no access to a quarter of all communications data.

The plans would cover when and to whom a phone call was made, not what was said. The content of emails would also not be stored, just details of who sent and received them.

In a separate move the Government is warning critical infrastructure is being targeted by online terrorists.

Cabinet Office Minister Francis Maude is 
publishing an update of the Government's cyber security strategy, 
including fresh measures to improve the UK's ability to detect and 
defeat high-end threats’.

Cyber attacks have been launched against the supplies 'upon which daily life depends,' including power firms

Cabinet Office minister Francis Maude is warning companies they must become more 'cyber savvy'

Systems controlling vital utilities like power and water supplies are being targeted, officials say.

Firms providing ‘the essential services upon which daily life depends’ have been attacked from abroad, an official told The Guardian.

The government is advising multi-national firms on how to prevent hackers disrupting supplies.

Mr Maude said the entire country needed to become more ‘cyber savvy’.

He added: ‘The internet transforms the risk we face. It is why we have rated attacks from cyberspace one of the top four threats to our national security.

‘We are in a race to build sufficient cyber defences to match the growing volume and dependence of our online economic, security and social interests.

‘It's a race we can only win by working together: Government, industry, academia and the public. This is as much a shared responsibility as a shared effort.’

Earlier this year Foreign Secretary William Hague and Business Secretary Vince Cable called in the chairmen and chief executives of Ftse 100 companies for a briefing in the Foreign Office to spell out the dangers including the online theft of valuable intellectual property and commercially sensitive information.

At the same time ministers want to highlight the commercial potential of Britain's growing expertise in cyber security to boost exports around the world.
