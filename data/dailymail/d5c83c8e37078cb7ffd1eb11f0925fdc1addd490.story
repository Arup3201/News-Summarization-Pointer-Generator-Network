Revenge porn is becoming an increasingly common way for embittered former partners to inflict pain.

But victims often feel helpless, unaware of how to get pictures taken offline and deeply embarrassed.

Folami Prehaya, whose ex posted intimate pictures online that were viewed 50, 000 times has bravely decided to speak out about this heinous crime to empower other victims, and has set up a website to help them. The case was reported by MailOnline earlier this month but Folami was not identified. Now she has broken her anonymity in a bid to help others.

Folami Prehaya, whose ex posted intimate pictures online that were viewed 50, 000 times, is speaking out about the crime of revenge porn and the impact it had on her life 

Folami's former boyfriend Thomas Samuel, 45, posted the explicit pictures of her using a spoof Facebook account after a bitter break-up and shared them with her family and friends.

Although Facebook removed the pictures  quickly, they had already been picked up by numerous porn sites.

Speaking on ITV's This Morning Folami explains: 'I feel totally embarrassed. It is so vindictive and cruel

'It has literally ruined my life in the sense that the pictures are still out there and still being seen.

The worst thing for me is i can't stop people viewing them, you have no control. 

Folami opened up on ITV's This Morning about how the act had 'ruined her life'

'Your personal, intimate stuff has gone public. To know they are being view on one porn site alone about 48,000 times it just awful.'

'I have tried to remove them and it's a lot harder than you think. You have to contact each webmaster one by one. 

Thomas Samuel, 45, posted the explicit pictures of her using a spoof Facebook account after a bitter break-up

'Most of those I have contacted have been good and removed them but I am still struggling with some and my next step I suppose is to take them to court.

'I can't change it, I just try and move forward with my life.'

She recalls how Thomas sent 15 to 20 friends requests from the spoof account to various people she knew of.

A couple of hours later, Folami started receiving calls from family and friends telling her what had appeared on a Facebook page bearing her name.

One friend, who accepted the request, said she saw a number of 'extremely explicit' pictures of the woman performing a sex act and other photos of a similar nature.

She described the pictures as 'jaw-dropping'.

Despite the deep level of humiliation she felt, Folami, from Bristol, was determined to not only get the photos removed, but also to see Thomas punished for his crime.

She pursued the case to Bristol Magistrates' Court, where although Thomas was found guilty he avoided  prison after his six month sentence was suspended for two years. 

He was also given a restraining order to stay away from Folami and ordered to pay court fines. 

Folami, who is still fighting to get her picture removed from some sites, has set up a website to help others 

Folami says that despite this low sentence, she doesn't feel that Thomas has won. 

'By going to court, by speaking about it I am doing something. It may not be much of a sentence but at least it is something.'

She has now set up a website 'Victims of Internet Crime' in a bid to help others.  

The website is a one-stop resource for free information on what victims can do in the aftermath of an online crime, and, more importantly, how they can prevent it in the future.

'I'm trying to empower other women or men who have gone through the same thing,' Folami explains.
