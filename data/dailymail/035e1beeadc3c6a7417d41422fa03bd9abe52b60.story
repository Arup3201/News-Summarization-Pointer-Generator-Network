A mother is set to be reunited with her two sons after almost a year following a court victory yesterday against her ex-husband who had refused to return them from Russia. 

Rachael Neustadt - an American who lives 
in London - says ex-husband Ilya Neustadt is keeping Daniel, seven, and 
Jonathan, five, in Russia in breach of orders made by a judge in England
 following a marriage break-up.

She had asked Russian judges to intervene - using a piece of international law ratified by Russia just five months ago.

Rachael Neustadt (left) has been 'enormously concerned' after her former husband went into hiding with her two sons, Daniel (centre), seven, and Jonathan (right), five. She also has a third son, Meir, who is still with her

And
 her lawyers said the Moscow City Appeal Court had recognised High Court
 orders made in England in a ruling delivered yesterday.

Solicitor
 Caroline Korah said she hoped that Ms Neustadt and the boys would soon 
be reunited following the 'landmark' court ruling.

Ms Neustadt, 36, said: 'I am so grateful to
 the judges and the court for taking this decision.

'I can’t wait until 
the boys and I are all back home in London - we all have a lot of hugs 
to catch up on and I will not rest until they are in my arms.'

She has a third son, one-year-old Meir, who she has kept with her.

The former teacher from Houston, Texas, had asked Russian judges to order her ex-husband, Ilya Neustadt, to return Daniel and Jonathan to England.

Mr
 Neustadt, 37, a former London Metropolitan University lecturer, refused
 to return the boys to their mother following a Christmas visit last 
year.

In November Ms Neustadt won a 'landmark' ruling in Russia, when the Moscow City Appeal Court recognised High Court orders made in England and said Daniel and Jonathan should be returned to their mother

She previously said she was 'deeply concerned' about her sons and feared their 'bond' would be damaged by the prolonged absence. 

She said: 'I love and miss them so much and I know they are missing me and their baby brother too.'

London law firm 
Dawson Cornwell, which represents Ms Neustadt, said an application had 
been made following Russia’s ratification of an international convention
 relating to cross-border disputes between parents in June.

Ilya Neustadt, 37, has defied demands to return his two sons to England and is now in hiding in Russia, according to his former wife's lawyers

Ms
 Neustadt began legal action and a judge sitting in the High Court in 
London ordered Mr Neustadt to return the boys to England - but he had 
not complied, solicitors said.

Lawyers
 said Russia ratified the 1996 Hague Convention on Jurisdiction, 
Applicable Law, Recognition, Enforcement and Co-operation in respect of 
Parental Responsibility and Measures for the Protection of Children 1996
 on June 1.

England joined the convention in November 2012.

They said the case was the first to make use of the 1996 Hague Convention for child abduction in England as well as in Russia.

Dawson
 Cornwell originally released details of the dispute in July after a 
Deputy High Court judge - who had analysed the dispute at hearings in 
London - gave Ms Neustadt permission to publicise the case.

The
 law firm said Ms Neustadt had made an application to the Moscow City 
Court for the return of the children to England - and that court had 
ruled in her favour on September 11.

Lawyers said Mr Neustadt had appealed.

But
 they said the Moscow City Appeal Court in Russia had upheld the 
September 11 decision 'to recognise and enforce' English High Court 
orders - and described the ruling as a 'landmark'.

'This
 is a complex and difficult matter,' said Miss Korah. 'It is 
heart-wrenching for the child and the left-behind parent when a parent 
wrongfully retains a child whilst abroad.

'With
 the tragedy of child abduction on the rise every year, the rights for 
the protection and best interests of children must be the paramount 
consideration.'

She added: 'We are thrilled at the ruling in Moscow and for Rachael and the boys, who we hope are all reunited soon.'
