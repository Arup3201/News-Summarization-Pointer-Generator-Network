London Mayor Boris Johnson will court controversy this week by taking media tycoon Rupert Murdoch to a top Olympics event as his personal guest.

The News Corporation boss and his wife Wendi Deng are among a group of business leaders invited by Mr Johnson to attend a swimming final expected to feature Britain’s Rebecca Adlington on Friday.

As Mayor, Mr Johnson has oversight of Scotland Yard, where a police investigation into the phone-hacking scandal that has engulfed the media mogul’s newspapers is still under way.

Mr Johnson’s decision to invite Mr 
Murdoch, despite the phone hacking scandal will be seen as a deliberate 
attempt to demonstrate his independence from David Cameron.

The Prime Minister has distanced himself from the tycoon since setting up the Leveson inquiry into media standards and ethics.

The London mayor was initially highly critical of an investigation into phone hacking, describing it as ‘codswallop’.

Mr Johnson is thought to have invited Mr Murdoch to attend because of his firms’ investment in British sport over many years, particularly BSkyB.

It is believed to be a ‘long-standing invitation’ that was also extended to other media executives.

Boris Johnson today made light of Team GB's meagre medal haul so far by commending the British for being polite hosts by not winning too much in the opening days.

Great Britain's two silvers and two bronzes leaves them trailing in 21st place in the medal table, way behind the leaders China, who have a total of 19.

Mr Johnson said: 'Everyone seems to be enjoying it (the Games). The transport system is holding up very well, and we still have plenty of medals to win.

'We have shown natural restraint and politeness in not hogging the medals board so far.'

Guardian editor Alan Rusbridger, whose 
newspaper has led a campaign against Mr Murdoch’s empire, is understood 
to have been invited but was unable to attend.

Mr Murdoch and his wife are expected to sit pool-side with Mr Johnson to watch Team GB star Miss Adlington go for gold in the 800m freestyle event.

She won gold in Beijing four years ago in the 800m, an will go into the event as one of the favourites, providing she makes it through Thursday’s heats.

 Mr Johnson was also pictured yawning yesterday as he and his family took in the beach volleyball on Horse Guards Parade.

However, his boredom appeared to manifest itself only during the men’s matches, and he seemed to perk up once the bikini-clad women competitors came on.

Len Duvall, leader of the Labour group on the London Assembly said: ‘There are serious questions as to the appropriateness of Boris Johnson taking Mr Murdoch to the Olympics.

‘An internal City Hall investigation is still underway after it was discovered the Mayor had failed to declare meetings with Mr Murdoch.

'I do not think it is appropriate for the Mayor to be entertaining Mr Murdoch in this way.’

Tensions: Mr Johnson's decision to invite Mr Murdoch, despite the phone hacking scandal that has engulfed his empire, will be seen as a deliberate attempt to demonstrate his independence from David Cameron

Jenny Jones, a green party member, said inviting Mr Murdoch was ‘inappropriate’ and showed ‘appalling judgment’ by the Conservative mayor.

‘Johnson seems to think he can get away with anything but there is always a step too far and this could be it. Most people will be appalled that he has taken someone who heads up a company that is currently involved in a criminal investigation,’ she said.

The Mayor’s official spokesman said: ‘As the Mayor has always said he would use the Games to shamelessly promote London as the leading business hub in Europe.

With that aim in mind he’s meeting and will continue to meet a range of business and media executives at or on the margins of Olympic events to further London’s drive for investment that will spur jobs and growth.’
