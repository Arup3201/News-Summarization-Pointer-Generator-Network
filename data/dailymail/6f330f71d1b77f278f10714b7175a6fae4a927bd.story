A 16-year-old girl has died after completing a half marathon and then collapsing just yards after the finish line.

Cameron Gallagher, from Richmond, Virginia, completed the Shamrock Half Marathon in Virginia Beach with her best friend at around 9.30am on Sunday as her family cheered them on.

But just 50 yards after she had crossed the finish line, she complained she didn't feel well and collapsed. She was rushed to a medical tent and taken to a nearby hospital where she died at 11am.

'Her heart had stopped and they just couldnâ€™t get it going back again,' her father David said.

While the cause of death is still being investigated, her family believes it was cardiac related.

Cameron, a sophomore at Douglas Freeman High School, was athletic and had won awards as a competitive swimmer, her parents, Grace and David, said.

Running was a new challenge but she had committed to training for the past nine weeks.

'Her entire mission was to enjoy the race and accomplish something and spread that cheer on to other people,' Gallagher said.

Her devastated parents said their daughter completed the race in 2 hours and 19 minutes. She had run side-by-side with her best friend, Abby Donelson, and seemed to be in good spirits throughout the 13.1-mile race, they said.

Determined: Cameron, right with her mother, trained for nine weeks to complete the race, her parents said

Missed: Cameron, one of five siblings, is believed to have died of a cardiac problem but investigations continue

At
 mile three, the couple said Cameron was still excited, but when they 
saw her at mile 10, she was noticeably tired. They then saw her finish 
the race with an 'ear-to-ear smile'.

'It was her time to go. Her last act of life was an accomplishment,' Mr Gallagher said, WTVR reported.

After the girl fell, 
fellow runners witnessed the commotion at the finish line, including 
Kelly Gdovic, who was running just 20 seconds behind Cameron.

'People were yelling to clear a hole and they were just literally running with her,' Gdovic told WAVY. 'She appeared to be still unconscious on the stretcher and they were just running.'

A Virginia Beach EMS spokesperson said they had 80 crew members around the course.

Best friend Abby Donelson said her friend complained of feeling sick after they finished.

'I
 went to hug her,' she told WRIC. 'We were walking away with our 
arms around each other and she said like "I'm going to pass out". And 
then she just kind of went down.'

Missed: Cameron, pictured, had complained of feeling faint before she collapsed 50 yards from the finish

Sadness: Grace and David Gallagher said they were proud of their daughter for achieving her goal

Witness: Her friend Abby Donelson said she went to hug Cameron, but she fell to the ground

She added: 'She
 just loved people. And she was very fun to be around 
and crazy. She really was just a genuine person and she really wanted to
 make a difference.'

In a statement on behalf of the family, Mr Gallagher said: 'We miss our sweet Cameron so much.

'Grace and I are so appreciative of her inspiration to our entire family. She set a goal and completed it with a smile as she did with so many accomplishments in her short life.

'Grace and I were given a gift to be with her during her accomplishment and we were with her in end.

'Please use Cameronâ€™s story as an inspiration to set goals, overcome obstacles and fight the good fight. She did that every day. We love you so Cameron.'
