It's one of the world's most famous brands, so as Nike celebrate the 25th anniversary of its iconic 'Just Do It' campaign, it's pulled out all the stops.

In its new advert, Nike has called in sporting legends LeBron James - the NBA's Most Vaulable Player - world number one tennis player Serena Williams, Gerard Pique of FC Barcelona and Spain, and boxing sensation Andre Ward.  

And the ladies will be delighted to know that The Hangover's Bradley Cooper narrates 
the sequence, which also features a guest appearance by actor Chris Pine, recently seen in the latest Star Trek film.

Just do it! Nike's new advert, which celebrates 25 years of its famous campaign, features a host of stars including actor Chris Pine (pictured)

The new film, directed by the acclaimed Nicolai Fuglsig (known for his Sony Bravia commercial featuring 250,000 bouncing balls let loose on the largest hill in San Francisco) hopes to inspire viewers to push their physical limits - by challenging the sporting world's greatest athletes.

If that doesn't get you out of bed, I don't know what will.

The film opens with Bradley Cooper saying: 'If you
can run a mile, run a race, run a marathon, outrun a movie star...' followed by snapshots of regular people challenging the acclaimed athletes in sporting feats.

In one shot, Chris Pine can be seen running against a fan on the street with action movie explosions in the background, while in another sequence a high school student faces boxing sensation Andre Ward in the ring.

Then the camera switches to an everyday table tennis player who faces Serena Williams in the U.S. Open at Flushing Meadow New York

As an amateur footballer is also seen being set up for a goal by Gerard Pique.

The camera then flashes to 6ft 8 LeBron James proving why he's one of the most famous players in the NBA as he takes on a 
basketball fan and beats him with an almighty dunk.

The film challenges the audience to virtually compete against the athletes featured using Nike+ FuelBand - an athletic bracelet that tracks your daily activity and calories burned and awards you 'fuel'.

Using their Nike+
Running app, which maps users' runs, distance and calories burned, and 
FuelBand, budding athletes can judge how they fare against the famous 
athletes in the film, as well as their friends and other ordinary 
participants

From August and into September Nike will be challenging you to #justdoit - 'Run The Distance' will task you and your friends to run a marathon in a week and sporting challenges against Nike stars will also be thrown into the mix, which will be tracked on a live leader board.

'For 25 years, we’ve been inspiring people to Just Do It,' said Davide Grasso, Nike Global Chief Marketing Officer. 

'With "Possibilities" we’re evolving that concept and actually enabling people to realise new heights, work towards new goals, and to physically Just Do It through Nike+.'

So what are you waiting for? Just do it! This could be your only chance to ace Serena Williams...

Nike 'Just Do It - Possibilities' challenges audiences to push their limits and strive to reach new goals with the Nike+ ecosystem. Viewers can explore their own 'Possibilities' through activations, including Nike+ Running and NikeFuel challenges.
