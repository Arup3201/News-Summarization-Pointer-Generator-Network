A 21-year-old Michigan man flagged down to help a woman who 
had just given birth on the side of the road is being credited for saving her baby's life after successfully performing CPR on the 
child.

Ryan Cornelissen, 21, says he was driving to the bank in Macomb Township on March 16th  when he discovered the baby's frantic father on the side of the road, signaling him to stop.

Pulling his car to the side, the troubled man, who appeared to speak only a little English, immediately handed him a phone already connected to 911.

Unexpected: Ryan Cornelissen, 21, says it was the child's father standing on the side of the road waving for help that led him to find the woman who had just given birth on the side of the road

Saved: The college student did exactly as police dispatch told him to do, gently tilting the baby's head back and performing CPR, which got this little girl breathing

Looking inside the car, Mr Cornelissen discovered the man's wife and his newborn daughter who didn't appear to be breathing.

'Something’s wrong with his wife, he doesn’t speak very good English. He stopped me on the side of the road,' Mr Cornelissen is heard saying in the 911 call obtained by WDIV.

Looking inside the car he says he saw the woman seated in the front seat with a blanket. Also with her, the head of a newborn baby girl.

'She just had a baby,' Mr Cornelissen calmly tells police as a woman's cries are heard behind him.

'She just had a baby?' dispatch asks.

'Yeah,' he answers.

What happened next, however, took a lot more from him than just pulling over and talking to 911.

Realizing the baby wasn't breathing, dispatch informed him that he'd have to perform CPR.

Help: It was on the road that Mr Cornelissen discovered the father and his wife needing help for their baby who wasn't breathing

Relief: The baby is pictured shortly after with her mother in the hospital, a stay that will last several weeks as she improves

Mr Cornelissen, a man who weighs 290lbs and played football in high school, was told to take the baby’s tiny head in his hands - a child weighing a mere 3lbs, 8oz - and do exactly as they instructed.

'Tilt its head back just a little, but not too much, OK? ... You're going to cover the baby's nose and mouth with your mouth,' a dispatcher instructs him.

'I did the second breath and I stepped back and he goes, "is the baby breathing?" I said no. And then all of a sudden the baby made a crying face.'

'Yes!' Mr Cornelissen is heard exclaiming in the phone call.

'I remember the face to a T,' he later said before making a scrunched up wailing face and then smiling. 'That was the face. I swear to God. That was the face. It was awesome.'

The baby is said to be doing fine but will have to stay in the hospital for several weeks.

In the meantime the baby's parents have already welcomed Mr Cornelissen into their home and say they hope he'll stay in their little girl's life.

Meeting: Mr Cornelissen meets the baby's father for the first time, in an emotional reunion the father says he hopes won't be the first

Premature: The little girl was born premature, weighing just 3lb, 8oz but is said to be doing well

No big deal: Mr Cornelissen, a local college student hoping to one day become a police officer himself, says that he doesn't think what he did was a big deal

Seen greeting the new dad outside his home, the father embraced him with a big hug telling him, 'I'm very happy to see you again.'

He then whipped out his digital camera and showed Mr Cornelissen a number of pictures since taken of his little girl.

In one photo, taken next to her mother, the baby’s seen wearing a bright pink bow in her black hair.

'I didn't think it was that big of a deal but apparently everyone else does,' Mr Cornelissen laughed.

Mr Cornelissen is currently a student at Macomb County Community College but he hopes to become a police officer one day.
