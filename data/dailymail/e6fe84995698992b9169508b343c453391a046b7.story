Farce may have descended yesterday on the Ukip ‘carnival’ in Croydon ahead of the European poll tomorrow.

But if you want to see how chaotic the elections really are, consider the ballot papers that await voters on Thursday.

The one for the London region includes the names of a staggering 127 candidates representing 17 different political parties.

The proportional voting system of the European elections favours small parties, meaning scores of fringe groups have been set up to sabotage Farage's Ukip

In total, there are 12 Euro electoral areas in Britain. Overall, a mind-boggling 757 candidates, representing 39 parties, are vying to be chosen as Britain’s 73 MEPs.

As in previous European elections there is a baffling array of fringe parties, and this year some have been formed with the  specific purpose of sabotaging Nigel Farage’s Ukip by confusing voters.

Three have been set up by former Ukip members who quit the party in protest at Farage’s style of leadership.

In the West Midlands, former Ukip MEP Nikki Sinclaire – who quit the party in 2010 – has set up the We Demand a Referendum Party.

Standing in the same region is the socialist dinosaur Dave Nellist, a former Labour MP who was ejected from the party in the 1990s because of links with the far-left Militant Tendency.

He’s a candidate for another anti-EU party, NO2EU, which is targeting Labour supporters and trade unionists tempted by Ukip.

Another NO2EU candidate is Ron Griffiths, general secretary of the Communist Party of Great Britain. Alongside him is the daughter of rail union firebrand Bob Crow, who died recently.

Natasha Hoarau says she’s standing not only in her father’s memory, but because she believes ‘the kind of socialism he worked so hard for cannot be built until we withdraw from the EU empire’.

In the South East region, Ukip is being challenged by Liberty GB, also set up by a disaffected member.

Farage fears that potential voters, especially older ones who might already be perplexed by the ballot paper, will see other anti-EU parties' names and wrongly vote for them instead of for Ukip

Arguably the biggest threat to Ukip is from the An Independence From Europe party which was set up last year by former Ukip MEP Mike Nattrass.

Cleverly, he ensured it comes close to the top of the ballot paper (which lists parties in alphabetical order) by including the word ‘An’.

This system means that the main parties – Labour, Conservative, Lib Dems – are buried further down. Farage’s Ukip is right at the bottom of the list.

Not surprisingly, Farage fears that potential voters, especially older ones who might already be perplexed by the ballot paper, will see other anti-EU parties’ names and wrongly vote for them instead of for Ukip.

The clutch of fringe parties are drawn to the European elections in Britain because, unlike general elections and by-elections, which use the first-past-the-post method, candidates are selected via a proportional representation system which favours smaller parties.

Indeed, the way MEPs are elected is just as complicated as the ballot paper.

Critics of the Euro poll also argue that the selection system is undemocratic because you can’t choose an individual candidate you want to be your MEP – only a party – and thus it cuts the important link between electors and candidates.

Among those who appear to have little hope of being elected is the Roman Party founded by Jean-Louis Pascual, a Frenchman from Bordeaux who’s now a Berkshire bus driver.

Then there’s candidate number six standing for the Animal Welfare Party. She is rock chick Meg Mathews, ex-wife of Oasis musician Noel Gallagher. Which says it all really.
