Nolberto Solano is desperate to prove himself as a manager in English or Scottish football, and has highlighted vacancies at Motherwell and Hartlepool United among potential starting points.

The former Newcastle United midfielder previously coached in Toronto, Canada, and was manager of Universitario de Deportes in his native Peru, but has been looking for a job in the UK since returning less than three months ago.

The 39-year-old claims he has already had an interview with Scottish Premiership club Motherwell, though that depends whether a proposed takeover by an Argentina-based consortium goes ahead.

Well Society are believed to have made the former Peru international their first choice after he discussed his 'philosophy' with the potential new owners following Motherwell's 1-0 win over Dundee United at Fir Park on November 7.

But Solano has told Sportsmail he remains open to all vacancies, including the empty slot at Hartlepool, where the midfielder ended his 19-year playing career in 2012.

'I've been coaching in Peru, coaching in Canada, so now I'm just trying to come back into the UK, looking for a chance, looking for an opportunity,’ he said.

'That's my plan. It's not easy. Scotland, Premier League, League One, League Two, it's still really tough for managers because it's not an easy job, but it's a challenge. My passion is football, always football. I cannot live without football.

'I'm definitely staying here (in the UK). But it's important you never know what happens. 

'Maybe I get a call again tomorrow, then another day to manage or coach in Peru, or anywhere in Europe or somewhere like that.

'My main place is here. It would be nice if anything came from Scotland or England. 

'I want to prove myself. I want to show what I can do as a manager.

'Hartlepool would be a why not? It is an opportunity. It is a really difficult time for the club, but it's a challenge. Life is a challenge all the time so it would be nice to get at least the opportunity.’

Paul Murray was sacked by the club sitting bottom of League Two on Saturday, less than 24 hours after they were beaten by non-League Blyth Spartans in the FA Cup second round at Victoria Park.

Solano, the first Peruvian to play in the Barclays Premier League, says he met Motherwell's potential new owners but that he understands 'four or five more managers' have been interviewed.

Hartlepool may prove a better fit for Solano, given its location in the North East where the Newcastle legend and his family currently live. 

Solano became the first Peruvian to play in the Premier League and has plenty of experience on the pitch

Like the Monkey Hangers,  Universitario were in the relegation zone when Solano took over but Solano lifted the Peruvian Primera Division club to safety.

'I'm looking anywhere,' Solano admits. 'I'm prepared to take that challenge, that opportunity. But we'll see. Maybe there are too many managers around.

'I'm simple. My philosophy in football is I would always like to play football. Even if you play in League One, League Two, you need to play. You need to be at that level. You need to bring more quality. That's my philosophy.'
