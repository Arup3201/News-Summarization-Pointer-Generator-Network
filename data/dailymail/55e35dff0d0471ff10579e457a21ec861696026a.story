Researchers have revealed an algorithm they say can spot the 'beauty' in photographs - and what makes a great selfie.

Yahoo Labs in Barcelona say their software can spot the best holiday snap, and even analyse your selfies.

They say their work could improve the quality of snaps online - and used 10,000 photographic portraits rated by humans to learn what we look for.

How to take the perfect selfie: Yahoo Labs in Barcelona say their software can spot the best holiday snap, and even analyse your selfies.

The key to a good picture, the researchers say, is 'Aesthetic score is related to sharpness of facial landmarks, image contrast, exposure, homogeneity, illumination pattern, uniqueness, and originality.

'race, gender, and age are largely uncorrelated with photographic beauty.' 

The single most important factor is the sharpness of the image.

But other important factors include the contrast between the face and background.  

'Digital portrait photographs are everywhere, and while the number of face pictures keeps growing, not much work has been done to on automatic portrait beauty assessment,' the team wrote in the open source journal arxiv.

The say the rise of the selfie has meant a huge increase in the number of pictures people take.

'Selfies' have become a phenomenon, and recent studies show that images with faces are more popular (+38% 'likes' on Instagram) than other pictures in online social networks. 

'Portraits are also used in web user profiles, in news articles, to represent celebrities and public figures, and they are an essential part of all kinds of IDs.'

The researchers found that in fact, the person in the picture is often irrelevant. 

'We find that race, gender, and age are largely uncorrelated with photographic beauty,' wrote the researchers, led by .  

'Aesthetic score is related to sharpness of facial landmarks, image contrast, exposure, homogeneity, illumination pattern, uniqueness, and originality,' they add.

They team say their algorithm is significantly better than other machine-based attempts to recognise beauty and provides some curious insights into the nature of photographic portraiture.

'We find that the beauty of a portrait is linked to its artistic value, and independent from age, race and gender of the subject.'  

The single most important factor is the sharpness of the image.

But other important factors include the contrast between the face and background. 

Pictures of females also tend to be more memorable, as well as brighter and post-processed, while pictures of males tend to have darker colors - and men smile less than women in portraits.

The team's algorithm determines which of these metrics correlated with the human beauty rating to decide how 'beautiful' an image is.

They began with a set of 10,000 photographic portraits that have been rated for beauty by humans on a scale from 1 to 10 and annotated with words and phrases that describe each image.  

The team first analyse each image using face recognition software that determines the age, sex and race of the main subject in each portrait along with the position of the face worked out from the relative coordinates of the eyes, nose and mouth.

They then created algorithms that measured how well each image achieved standard photographic techniques of composition, exposure and lighting. 

These included the arrangement of objects within the image, the distribution of lighting within the image and the sharpness of the picture. 

They also measured the exposure quality, contrast and jpeg compression along with the contrast between the face and the background.

The final step used the human annotations to classify the emotional polarity of each image, whether positive or negative and assessed the originality of the image compared to others.

The team's algorithm then  determines which of these metrics correlated with the human beauty rating. 

The team say their algorithm is far more successful than other attempts to spot good pictures

They say it can do this incredibly successfully.

'We also show that a classifier trained with our features to separate beautiful portraits from non beautiful portraits outperforms generic aesthetic classifiers.' 

'In our future work, we plan to broaden our framework by extending our database to include portrait images 'in the wild', exploring portrait aesthetics with a more challenging context,' they said.

'Physical/demographic properties such as gender, eye color, glasses, age, and race show very low correlation with image beauty, suggesting that any subject, no matter his/her traits, can be part of a stunning picture,' conclude Redi and co.
