Gene Haas is confident he can avoid the 'mistakes' he feels have been made by other new teams ahead of entering Formula One in 2016.

Of the three marques that made their bow in the sport in 2010, HRT have already folded, Caterham are on the brink of going to the wall, whilst Marussia continue to struggle financially.

Haas, who runs a successful team in America's NASCAR, has already been told he is crazy for trying to break into F1, but has belief he will make it on to the grid in 17 months' time.

'I guess I don't have any doubts we can do it,' said Haas, speaking to CNN.

'People keep saying, 'Well, you're going to fail', but to me it's just a challenge you need to do.

'I know it's a hard, but just don't give up. You just keep banging your head against the wall until you open the door.'

Haas was granted his entry earlier this year, but opted against a 2015 start date, believing the additional year would ensure he and his team would be fully prepared.

That is where he feels the likes of HRT, Caterham and Marussia stumbled as they only had six months to put together a team and build their cars.

'The biggest problem they had, in trying to get to the grid so fast, they wound up having to take on partnerships that maybe weren't thoroughly thought out,' added Haas.

'They wound up making a lot of mistakes. Inevitably they didn't have the resources, or the cars weren't properly put together, because they rushed things.'

One route Haas has taken is to form a partnership with Ferrari who will supply the power trains and other key parts, further adding credence to his team's entry.

That, however, has led to suggestions Haas will be nothing more than a 'B team' for Ferrari, although it is a comment he appreciates.

'Ferrari were more accommodating. Surprisingly they wanted to go beyond just being an engine supplier,' said Haas.

'They were going to help us with a lot of the basic structure of the car.

'And we'd be very proud to be a Ferrari 'B' team because that would certainly teach us how to run in Formula One.

'Quite frankly we will take all the help they can give us because you can't get any better than Ferrari.'

Haas, though, is aware of the struggles he will encounter once he is up and running, which is why he is not setting his sights high.

Asked to define a successful time in F1, Haas replied: 'In the first five years it's just surviving.

'I don't have expectations of grandeur we are going to go out there and win championships.

'If we can even win one race in five years then I think that would be a tremendous success.'
