Ahead of the G20 summit this weekend in Australia, Barack Obama's delegation made a request to have a major roundabout in Brisbane demolished.

The reason: So his enormous presidential car 'The Beast' will not have to slow down outside the University of Queensland, where the US President is due to give a speech on Saturday.

However Queensland authorities apparently rejected the request to demolish and reconstruct the roundabout outside the university's St Lucia campus, The Australian reported.

US President Barack Obama's delegation requested a roundabout be demolished before his arrival at G20

Its removal was requested so as not to slow down his presidential car, The Beast

The roundabout in question was this one outside the University of Queensland's St Lucia campus

It is likely the President's personnel are trying to avoid an incident similar to the one in Ireland in 2011, when the car apparently became stuck on a ramp while exiting the US Embassy in Dublin. 

The Beast is a heavily armoured Cadillac with many unique features such as a special night vision system and protection from any biochemical attacks.

It also has a blood bank with the President's type in storage in case of an emergency.

The Beast was seen arriving in Brisbane on Thursday evening

It was surrounded by a full motorcade and roads were blocked off so it could enter the city

Mr Obama is expected to touch down in Brisbane on Saturday morning sometime after 10am, and with him will be a massive presidential motorcade.

On Thursday afternoon The Beast arrived in Brisbane and entire roads en route from the airport were blocked off for the procession.

Footage aired by Nine News shows the huge car driving along a motorway tailed by a number of other vehicles.
