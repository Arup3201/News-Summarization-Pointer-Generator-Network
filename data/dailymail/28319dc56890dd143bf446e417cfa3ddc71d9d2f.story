Silverstone, the home of British motor racing, is in turmoil after the suspension of three directors, including managing director Richard Phillips.

Sportsmail understands the three executives were suspended last week and will remain on full pay until an investigation has been completed.

The upheaval comes as businessman Lawrence Tomlinson, who was ‘entrepreneur in residence’ to the government, leads a significant review into how Silverstone operates.

The British Racing Drivers Club are taking a closer role into running Silverstone, with Lewis Hamilton (above) seen driving past the BRDC stand at the circuit at the British Grand Prix this year

The British Racing Drivers’ Club, who own Silverstone, confirmed in an internal statement sent to its members: ‘The BRDC are taking a closer role in the running of the Silverstone business, with a new operating structure between the Club and the circuit.

‘John Grant, chairman of the BRDC, and Lawrence Tomlinson, director of the BRDC, have assumed the role of joint acting chief executive of Silverstone Circuits Limited (SCL).

‘Having reviewed the Silverstone business, they have embarked on an exciting programme of restructuring to make the business more streamlined, concentrating on their core competencies as a circuit operator and the home of the British Grand Prix.

‘Whilst we cannot comment on the suspension of senior executives at SCL, it should be noted that this is only coincidental to the restructure.’

Phillips has been managing director for 10 years. He previously worked at Brands Hatch and on other sporting projects including the 1991 Rugby World Cup.

The new paddock and pit complex including the wing has played a role in Silverstone's recent losses

Despite Silverstone securing a 17-year contract to host F1 in 2010 – at annual cost of about £15million – the need to secure the circuit’s long-term viability remains a challenge. The building of a new paddock and pit complex has meant Silverstone has made net losses of £5.8m over the last three years.

With Bernie Ecclestone taking TV, advertising and corporate money, ticket sales are virtually the circuit’s only money-making opportunity during Formula One grand prix weekends.

The BRDC, comprising 850 important motor-racing figures, have been looking to sell Silverstone, but drew a line under those plans earlier this year, with chairman Neil England resigning in July to make way for Tomlinson.

Since then MotoGP have announced their annual race will be leaving Silverstone from next year to be held at Donington in the interim before supposedly moving to the Circuit of Wales, a new track near Ebbw Vale that is being backed by the devolved assembly in Cardiff.

Meanwhile, Silverstone continue to look at fresh revenue-generating schemes, including the long-cherished idea of building a hotel on their Northamptonshire site.

Tomlinson, who joined the BRDC board in August, is ranked 151st in the Sunday Times Rich List with an estimated fortune of £550m. A Yorkshireman, he owns Ginetta Cars Ltd and won the GT2 class at Le Mans in 2006.

The British Racing Drivers' club announced on October 20 in an internal statement to their members that they had started the restructuring of Sliverstone Circuits (SCL) organisation.
