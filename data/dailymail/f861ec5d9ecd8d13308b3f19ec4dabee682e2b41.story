Hundreds of thousands of parking fines may have been wrongly issued because councils have ‘made up’ signs not approved by the Government.

The number of tickets issued by wardens has soared in recent years with drivers now hit with penalties of up to £80 every 4.6 seconds.

Many of those fines are given to motorists in spaces that have been suspended to allow for road repairs or other works.

Investigation: Almost 350,000 fines in 16 council areas of London may have been issued unlawfully because the local authorities did not have authorisation for their signs, according to a BBC Inside Out probe (file picture)

But an investigation has found 
thousands of ‘suspended parking bay’ notices have not been cleared with 
the Department for Transport.

That means in London alone almost 
350,000 parking fines – totalling £23million – may have been unlawfully 
issued because of the invalid signs.

Neil Davies, a motoring solicitor at 
the law firm Caddick Davies, said: ‘From a legal perspective councils 
are on very shaky ground, because the signage they used is effectively 
made up.

‘They may be relying on the fact many people don’t challenge parking notices.’

The DfT provides a ‘book’ of designs for road signs that authorities must follow.

But it has not yet produced a 
template for a ‘suspended parking bay’ sign, meaning councils must get 
each individual notice cleared by the DfT before it complies with 
Traffic Signs Regulations. A typical London council suspends more than 
1,500 parking bays a month and at least 28 authorities had not applied 
for clearance for their signs before 2012.

In January 2010, motorist Suzanne 
Campbell defeated London’s Camden Council at a Parking and Traffic 
Appeals Service hearing after being ticketed in a suspended parking bay.

Adjudicator Edward Houghton said: ‘In
the absence of a compliant sign the vehicle was not in contravention 
and the appeal must be allowed.

‘No doubt the council will give consideration to obtaining the Secretary of State’s authorisation.’

Motorists fined years ago might find it hard to claw money back because there is a time limit of 28 days for appeals.

But Mr Davies said both councils and 
the Parking and Traffic Appeals Service could use their discretion to 
hear historic appeals, adding: ‘There’s certainly a strong moral 
argument for councils to refund those monies.’

A BBC investigation found there was a
rush of applications for authorisation from London councils after the 
Suzanne Campbell ruling but at least 14 local authorities still have no 
clearance.

Local authorities raised an estimated
£411million from parking charges last year, but a quarter of the 
6.8million parking tickets given out in 2011 were disputed with 39 per 
cent of challenges succeeding. 

The DfT was yesterday unable to say how many had applied for approval for ‘suspended parking  bay’ signs.
