Survivors of the Sydney siege crisis have shared an emotional moment in Martin Place, paying tribute to their lost friends Katrina Dawson and Tori Johnson, whose lives were celebrated at separate memorial services today. 

Former hostages Selina Win Pe, Joel Herat, Harriette Denny, Elly Chen, Fiona Ma and Bae Jie-un comforted each other as they visited a new floral memorial, covered by a marquee, located just metres from the Lindt café where they were held hostage by crazed gunman Man Haron Monis last week.

Supported by the Reverend Bill Crews and friends, a visibly emotional Ms Win Pe trembled with emotion as she placed a bouquet among a sea of flowers and stroked a photograph of Mr Johnson. 

The hostages had just spent more than an hour listening to tributes to cafe manager Mr Johnson at St Stephen's Uniting Church, around the corner from the floral memorial. 

During the emotional but joyous service, mourners sung Always Look On The Bright Side Of Life and heard amusing stories about Mr Johnson's upbringing.

A packed service was this afternoon being held for fellow victim, barrister and mother-of-three Katrina Dawson, at the University of Sydney, whose parents delivered heartfelt speeches.

Her mother, Jane Dawson, told assembled mourners: 'She [Katrina] was all the wonderful things people have said about her and more. Please don't forget her.'

Her father, Sandy, added: 'She gave our family 38 years of joy... If only she could give her children 38 years of the same.'

Ms Dawson's friend, pregnant fellow siege hostage Julie Taylor, said: 'She made me want to be a mother'.

In his eulogy on Tuesday morning, Tori's father Ken Johnson recounted several hilarious moments from his son's childhood - such as when a five-year-old Tori bit a fellow infant at a birthday party, and was bitten by the girl in return the next year.

'He came into the world wearing bare feet and he never wore shoes - but always had a smile on his face,' relatives quoted Mr Johnson saying at the invitation-only service. While Mr Johnson had a person on stage to support him, he did not need assistance.

Relative Debra Clarke said she was 'blown away' when Tori's partner, Thomas Zinn, addressed the service.

She said she was left in hysterics by some of the stories told by Mr Zinn and Mr Johnson's sister, Radha, who recalled 'mucking around' with Tori when they were young and going on adventures.

As they left the church, mourners were each given a sunflower. As the congregation filtered out from the church, they placed the flowers on the top of Mr Johnson's coffin. 

Buddhist monks chanted as this took place, in a kind of 'dirge', relative Debra Clarke, from Newcastle, told Daily Mail Australia. 'I've never seen anything like it,' Mrs Clarke said. 

Mr Johnson's coffin was placed in the back of a white hearse and taken to a site in Sydney's eastern suburbs. He was cremated this afternoon, surrounded by family and friends.  

A second hearse was filled with flowers. Funeral attendants carried dozens of bouquets to the new Martin Place memorial, as the former hostages watched on.

Several dignitaries attended Mr Johnson's service, including Police Commissioner Andrew Scipione, NSW Premier Mike Baird, Sydney Lord Mayor Clover Moore and Federal government minister Malcolm Turnbull. 

Guests were welcomed inside the stately building to a performance of Ava Maria and heard speeches from family and friends celebrating Mr Johnson's 'love, generosity and life'.

The funeral site was just a few hundred metres from where Mr Johnson died in Martin Place. Tens of thousands of people have placed posies and condolence messages at the site in the last week, creating a field of flowers.  

Last Friday, Thomas Zinn, Mr Johnson's partner of 14 years, said nothing would have delighted him more than the extraordinary floral tribute. 

‘When I was down there yesterday, I could smell the flowers through Sydney, and I think it’s just amazing he has been able to make our city smell like flowers,’ Mr Zinn told the Nine Network.

‘I think there is no more beautiful thing that he could imagined.’

That message was played at the beginning of today's church service. 

The immense floral tribute to Johnson and his fellow victim, barrister Katrina Dawson, was cleared by volunteer workers this morning.  

However, a new marquee flower tribute has been set up in Martin Place this afternoon. 

Written notes and presents placed with the old flowers will be kept for the families. The old flowers will be mulched. 

New South Wales Premier Mike Baird has said the government will discuss a permanent memorial with the Johnson and Dawson families when they are ready.

A memorial service will be held for Ms Dawson at Sydney University at 3pm AEDT. Her three children have each selected songs to be played in tribute to their mother. 

They include Somewhere Over The Rainbow, The Gambler and - perhaps most heartbreaking - Santa Claus is Coming To Town.  

Members of the public hoping to sign condolence books for the pair will still be able to leave their messages at the Sydney Opera House. 

Tributes can also be left online here.

Touching ceremony: Today's send-off was hosted at the St Stephens Uniting Church on Macquarie St, just a few hundred metres away from the scene of the siege at Martin Place

In a remarkable act of bravery, Mr Johnson attempted to seize gunman Man Haron Monis's weapon as hostages fled the site where they were held captive for more than 16hours
