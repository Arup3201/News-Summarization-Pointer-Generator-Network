Former Premier League defender Clarke Carlisle, who was seriously injured in a collision with a lorry last month, is awake in hospital.

His wife, Gemma Carlisle, said on Twitter on Tuesday evening: 'Thank you again for asking after Clarke. He's still in hospital but is getting better & stronger each day.'

She was asked by another Twitter-user: 'Is he awake yet Gemma? Hope he's well soon from a football fan.' Mrs Carlisle replied: 'Yes.'

Clarke Carlisle was part of the Burnley side that won promotion in the 2009 Championship play-off final

Carlisle is well respected in the game and was chairman of the Professional Footballers' Association

The 35-year-old former Professional Footballers' Association chairman was seriously injured following the collision on the A64, near York, on December 22 and remains in a Leeds hospital.

North Yorkshire Police launched an investigation into the circumstances of the incident and appealed for witnesses.

Since the collision, a host of footballers, former clubs, organisations and charities have used social media to send messages hoping Carlisle makes a quick recovery.

The Metropolitan Police later confirmed that Carlisle was charged with failing to provide a sample on December 20 - days before his serious injuries - and is due to appear in court later this month.
