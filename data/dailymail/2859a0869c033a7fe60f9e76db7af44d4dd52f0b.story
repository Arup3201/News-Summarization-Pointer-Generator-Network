Thousands of people at risk of losing their sight from a diabetes-related condition could benefit from a new drug approved for NHS use.

The rationing body Nice has finally given the go ahead for Lucentis after the makers dropped the price.

The drug treats diabetic macular oedema (DMO), which affects around 50,000 Britons causing problems with reading, driving and recognising faces.

This offers fresh hope for people with a serious and common complication of diabetes.

Currently laser treatment is used to stabilise the condition which if left untreated causes 30 per cent of patients to go blind.

Clinical trials show Lucentis, given as an injection in the eye, is the first treatment that can help reverse vision loss for some patients.

But the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (Nice) last year said the drug was not ‘a good use of NHS resources’ at £750 for each monthly injection.

Four UK charities failed in their appeal to stop the proposed ban, but Nice re-visited the decision after makers Novartis cut the price by an undisclosed amount.

Nice tried to ban Lucentis before, when it was initially licensed for another cause of blindness called wet age-related macular degeneration, or AMD, in 2007.

It would have meant patients had to go blind in one eye first but Nice was forced into a U-turn after thousands of protests.

Lucentis is one of the most costly drugs for the NHS, which spent £130 million on the treatment in 2010, although patient access scheme for AMD patients capped the cost at £10,400 for 14 injections or more.

Complication: DMO, which affects around 50,000 Britons is related to diabetes

However, consultant ophthalmologist Ben Burton, from the James Paget University Hospital, Great Yarmouth, said the drug was one of the great breakthroughs in eye disease.

He said ‘This has the impact of insulin, penicillin or steroids in our field. It prevents loss of vision and means older people at risk retain the ability to drive a car, and live independent lives.

‘Up until now, most patients could only receive laser treatment on the NHS, which usually just stops their vision worsening but does not necessarily improve it.’

The drug is more effective than laser treatment, although that will still be used for some patients, he added.

Steve Winyard, head of policy and campaigns at the Royal National Institute of Blind People (RNIB), one of the charities which appealed against the proposed ban, said at least 5,000 new diabetic patients a year could be eligible for the drug, which has a better chance of saving their sight than existing treatment.

When injected into the eye, the drug also known as raniizumab, slows the leakage of small blood vessels in the retina.

Barring appeals, draft guidance from Nice will be confirmed in February, when local trusts will have to find funding for the treatment.

Barbara Young, chief executive of Diabetes UK, said ‘We are delighted that Nice have reconsidered their previous decision, and that this draft guidance recommends that Lucentis is made available on the NHS, as this would mean more people with diabetes would have a better opportunity to preserve and possibly improve their vision.

‘We have campaigned vigorously for this outcome for the past two years and so welcome this result and hope this is reflected in the final guidance when it is issued next month.’

Professor Carole Longson, Health Technology Evaluation Centre Director at Nice, said ‘Nice is pleased to recommend ranibizumab as a treatment option for some people with visual impairment caused by diabetic macular oedema in new draft guidance.

‘In November 2011, Nice published guidance which did not recommend the drug as an effective use of NHS resources.

‘However, following the submission of a revised patient access scheme, we have conducted a rapid review of the original guidance. ‘

Barbara Young, chief executive of Diabetes UK, said ‘We are delighted that Nice have reconsidered their previous decision, and that this draft guidance recommends that Lucentis is made available on the NHS, as this would mean more people with diabetes would have a better opportunity to preserve and possibly improve their vision.

‘We have campaigned vigorously for this outcome for the past two years and so welcome this result and hope this is reflected in the final guidance when it is issued next month.’
