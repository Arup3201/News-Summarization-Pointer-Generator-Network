Only two out of 20 of the U.S.’s leading sunscreens actually provide the SPF protection that is described on their bottles, according to a new study.

Consumer Reports tested 20 of the leading sunscreens in a lab to find that very few of these protectants actually hold up to their initial worth after only a brief exposure to sun, sweat, and water.

The only two that did succeed were BullFrog's Water Armor Sport InstaCool SPF 50+ spray and Coppertone Water Babies SPF 50.

Big winners: Consumer Reports has recommended Coppertone's Water Babies Formula and Bullfrog's Water Armor Sport as the top two performing products

Top products: Consumer Reports has recommended seven sunscreens based on their level of effectiveness in combatting UVA and UVB rays, including Banana Boat's Ultra Defense Spray, Target's Up& Up Sport Spray, and Walgreen's Continuous Spray

Holding up: These recommended products were vigorously tested by the magazine on human subjects, leading Consumer Reports to also recommend Neutrogena's Ultimate Sport and Equate's Broad-Spectrum formula

Consumer Reports’ most effective sunscreen products:

Five other recommended sunscreens:

Big 
winners - aside from the best performing two - included Banana Boat’s Ultra 
Defense Max Skin Protect SPF 110 spray, as well as Target’s Up & Up 
Spray Sport SPF 50.

Those
that did not stack up, and did not earn a recommendation include Banana 
Boat Kids SPF 50 as well as Coppertone Sport High Performance SPF 30 
spray.

In
 fact, many sunblocks' efficiency came in at four to 40per cent below their claims. Beyond 
Coastal's Natural SPF 30 came in at less than half of its purported 
effectiveness.

The magazine warns that while the FDA 
regulates SPF, broad spectrum, and water resistance claims, they only do
 so by reading brand studies of required health standards - and do not 
verify these results or conduct tests of their own.

But according to the study, this does not mean that the offending sunscreens do not offer any protection at all.

Even at half its effectiveness rate, Beyond Coastal's sunscreen is still offering an SPF 15's worth of protection - which according to the magazine, does not offer all that much difference in terms of protection from a SPF 50 product.

Falling short: Of the 20 sunscreens that it tested, Consumer Reports has advised shoppers against 13 - which included California Baby's Super Sensitive Broad Spectrum, Coppertone Sport Accuspray, and CVS Sheer Mist Spray

While an SPF 15 can block 93per cent of 
rays at its optimal efficiency, a SPF 50 is only a grain ahead with 
98per cent of ray protection.

Rather than scare consumers about the dangers of purchasing an SPF, researchers hopes to educate them to investigate products prior to purchase.

They achieved their lab results by applying products in patches to test subjects’ skin. All of the products evaluated had a minimum SPF level of 30.

The
 panellists were then instructed to soak in a tub, after which they were
 exposed to UVB radiation – the kind that causes sunburns and skin 
cancer - from a sun simulator.

One
 day later the patches were examined for redness – the results of which 
led Consumer Reports to rate their corresponding sunscreens on their 
levels of effectiveness.

A
 separate group of test subjects followed the same procedure, but were 
exposed to UVA rays instead – the kind that creates a tan and ages skin.
 Their test patches were evaluated for levels of tan, rather than 
redness.

Tests inspired by the FDA's critical wavelength studies were also conducted, by covering plastic plates in SPF to see how UV rays are absorbed by the heated plates.

Washing away: These sunscreens, including Walgreen's Baby Formula and Banana Boat Kids, lost an average of 4 to 40per cent effectiveness when exposed to water, with Beyond Coastal's SPF losing half its efficiency

Safety measures: While a dissipated efficiency does not mean consumers are not receiving any protection at all, the magazine recommends that sunscreen is reapplied every two hours when sweating and swimming to ensure the best result, but would not recommend Coppertone's Sensitive Skin, No-Ad Sport, or Up & Up's Kids formula

For optimal use, the magazine says 
that consumers should apply sunblock 15 to 30 minutes prior to sun 
exposure, and should reapply it every two hours after swimming or 
sweating.

In
 tabulating their results, the magazine was able to recommend seven 
sunscreen products to consumers, also including their cost as a deciding
 factor in what protectants are a worthy buy.

Coppertone's Water Babies formula and Bullfrog's Water Armor Sport product are the two top performing sunblocks

Other sunscreens, like Beyond Coastal's SPF 30, hold as little as half their SPF claims
