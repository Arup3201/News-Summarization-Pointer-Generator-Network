Just imagine the shock on Cassie Woods’s face when her phone bleeped with an email from her mother - two years after she passed away.

Relatives say Paula Chase’s Yahoo account was hacked in September and spam email messages are being sent out around every three days.

Her daughter, of Stafford, Virginia, is upset by the emails with subjects such as ’male enhancement’, ‘work at home’ and ‘cheap Viagra’.

Extremely upset: Cassie Woods says her mother Paula Chase's Yahoo email account was hacked in September and is sending out spam messages

‘I don't think it's fair that me and my sisters have to suffer seeing an email from my mum that's not even here,’ Mrs Woods told WTSP.    

‘I was kind of hysterical,’ she told the Free Lance-Star. ‘I fell on the floor crying.’ Everyone in Ms Chase’s address book is getting the emails.

Ms Chase died in October 2009 aged 46 from the auto-immune disorder ‘scleroderma’ - but the emails began around two years later.

Recent email subjects have also included ‘Look what I found here’, ‘I am free now’ and ‘How to start your new life’.

Dead for two years: Paula Chase's email account is sending out messages with subjects such as 'male enhancement', 'work at home' and 'cheap Viagra'

Her husband Jarrod, an Iraq veteran, sent an email asking the hacker to stop and threatened that he would otherwise go to the police.

What makes the situation worse for the family is that the emails have kept on coming and some are obscene or graphic.

‘She was a Christian lady, and to see male enhancement in an email from her - it was kind of devastating,’ Mrs Woods told WTSP.

Mr Woods said a Yahoo supervisor told him they needed three items to close the account but did not tell him where to submit them.

They wanted a copy of the death certificate, a written request to close the account and proof the person making the request was related.

A Yahoo spokesman said the company sympathises with the family and would like to make sure the account is properly closed.

Mrs Chase’s family are still trying to get a death certificate, but her obituary can be seen online and she is in the Social Security death index.
