This family certainly had an unforgettable Father’s Day - but it was all for the wrong reasons.

Nancy Passarella was enjoying dinner with her family on their Martha Stewart Living patio table when the glass suddenly shattered.

Her son and his girlfriend were cut by flying glass and the food was ruined as the table exploded right in front of the family in Denver, Colorado.

Ms Passarella bought the table from Kmart around three years ago and says she has followed the care instructions closely since then.

But then on Sunday she said the startled family heard a ‘loud explosion’.

‘The table proceeds to disintegrate,’ she told Fox 31. ‘I can't believe what happens. My son and his girlfriend were cut by the flying glass.’

Rick Passerella told 7 News: ‘There could have been kids down lower and could've gotten faces cut. You just don't know.’

Ms Passarella took photos showing the injuries suffered by her family - and she is not the first to have trouble with the table.

Hundreds of complaints have been filed about it and there was a lawsuit against Martha Stewart Living of making defective tables in 2005.

The Consumer Products Safety Commission told Martha Stewart Living to redesign the table in 2006 to make it safer, reported Fox 31.

A Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia spokesman told Fox 31 and 7 News they take product safety ‘very seriously’.

‘Because we do not oversee the mechanical design, engineering or manufacturing of the products, we require all of our vendor partners to adopt and comply with product safety programmes and reviews.’

The spokesman then directed customers to Kmart. A Kmart spokesman told 7 News: ‘We believe that these tables are safe’.

Kmart and Martha Stewart Living ended a patio furniture contract two years ago and the product is no longer being made.
