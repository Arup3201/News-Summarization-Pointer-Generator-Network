From the formidable looking Jeanne Granier, a French actress and soprano, to the winsome Gabrielle Réjane, the opera stars of the Victorian era were just as glamorous as the divas of today.

The pair appear in a collection of more than 200 vintage photos newly released by the Royal Opera House, all of which date from the late Victorian and Edwardian periods.

Other stars to appear in the collection, amassed by Gwladys Robinson, Lady de Grey, include Ernest Van Dyck, a Belgian tenor who died in 1923, and Félicia Mallet, a popular French comedian, singer and mime artist.

Many of the photos are signed and include personal dedications to Lady de Grey, later Marchioness Ripon, a long standing supporter of the Royal Opera House who enjoyed friendships with many of the era’s leading names and died in 1917.

Lady de Grey was also partly behind the decision to rename what had been known as the Royal Italian Opera to the Royal Opera House in 1892 following a controversy over whether operas in languages other than Italian should be introduced.

They were and thereafter, opera-goers were treated to performances in French and German as well as English, and the chance to see some of Europe’s most celebrated stars perform.

Among them were L’Enfant Prodigue [The Prodigal Son], which featured a score written by Claude Debussy, and a version of Aristophanes’ comedy Lysistrata featuring the beautiful Gabrielle Réjane in the title role.

For fans of German opera, there were productions of Parsifal, Wagner’s lengthy epic based on the story of Percival, an Arthurian knight on a quest for the Holy Grail.

At the same time, the owners of the Royal Opera House chose to broaden its output to include ballet and pantomime, both of which still appear at the Covent Garden venue today.

And it seems modern audiences haven’t lost their taste for the European operas pioneered by Lady de Grey and her friends.

Later this year, the Royal Opera House will welcome a production of Die Frau ohne Schatten [The Woman Without A Shadow], a Strauss opera first performed in 1919 and still loved by audiences today.

One of London's
 oldest surviving theatres, the Royal Opera House has a long and 
fascinating history and first opened its doors to audiences in 1732.Although
 the original building no longer exists, the current Opera House - the 
third to occupy the site - dates from 1857 and was designed by leading 
19th century architect, Edward Middleton Barry.But its operatic 
tradition goes back much further, with the first, by Handel, shown in 
1735 - a year after the first ballet appeared on stage.Since 
then, the Royal Opera House has played host to work by some of the 
greatest composers ever to have lived, as well as performances from the 
singing stars of every era.Currently the home of the Royal 
Ballet as well as the Royal Opera, the coming year includes a rendition 
of Puccini's classic opera Tosca as well as a ballet version of 
Shakespeare’s much-loved play, The Winter’s Tale.
