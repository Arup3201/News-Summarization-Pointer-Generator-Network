Though French fries are often dangerous for the waistline, they were also one man’s weapon of choice.

James Hackett, 26, allegedly got into a fight about money with his wife after picking up a meal at McDonald's. 

When his 11-year-old stepdaughter tried to peaceably interject from the back seat, he allegedly threw ‘hot and oily’ fries at her face.

Deadly weapon? James Hackett, 26, left, allegedly threw an order of 'hot and oily' fries at his 11-year-old stepdaughter

According to the Smoking Gun, Hackett’s wife and stepdaughter had picked him up from work and were taking him to the Golden Arches for a meal.

Once they had the food in their vehicle, Hackett and his wife began arguing about money matters. 

Though the police report says the argument over money ‘did not get physical,’ things rapidly escalated.

The 11-year-old girl was sitting in the back seat, apparently trying to mediate between the two.

That’s when Hackett allegedly pulled out the order of fries and threw it at his stepdaughter, ‘striking her in the face and chest,’ the police report states.

The report notes that the girl was not seriously injured by the attack, but that throwing hot French fries at someone’s face could lead to burns and other injuries.

At one point, Hackett pulled their vehicle over and fled on a motorcycle. The girl’s mother then called the police.

Fast justice: He pleaded not guilty to assault and battery charges and will appear in court in August

Hackett was later found by a Lowell Police officer, and was informed that ‘he was being charged with assault and battery with a dangerous weapon to wit French fry.’

Hackett was free on bail and pleaded not guilty to the charges. He next appears in court in August, and is forbidden to have contact with his stepdaughter between now and then, the Lowell Sun reported.

Massachusetts law defines assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon as ‘an instrument of offensive or defensive combat…anything used or designed to be used in destroying, defeating, or injuring an enemy.’

It goes on to say: ‘An item that is normally used for innocent purposes can become a dangerous weapon if it is intentionally used in a way that it reasonably appears to be capable of causing serious injury or death to another person.’
