President Barack Obama has abandoned a proposal to scale back the tax benefits of college savings plans amid a backlash from both Republicans and Democrats.

Obama announced the changes to popular accounts, known as 529s for the area of the tax code that allows them, last week as part of his State of the Union address. 

It was part of a plan to consolidate and simplify a sometimes confusing array of tax breaks for college students into two simple measures that would result in a net tax reduction of $50 billion over 10 years.

Resistance from Congress was swift, with even Democrats deriding the 'middle-class economics' proposal  as anti-middle class.

The White House is already dropping a proposal Obama made in the speech to to scale back the tax benefits of college savings plans amid a backlash from both Republicans and Democrats in Congress

Aides said House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi pushed senior administration officials to drop it as she flew with the president aboard Air Force One from India to Saudi Arabia.

Other Democrats also privately weighed in against the plan, including Rep. Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, the top Democrat on the House Budget Committee, and New York Sen. Charles Schumer, the No. 2 Democrat in the Senate.

'The President's plan has the puzzle pieces necessary to bring the middle class back, but this particular piece didn't fit,' Schumer said in a statement. 

The White House said Wednesday Obama yanked the proposition from his budget because it had become a 'distraction.'  

Obama's plan would have levied taxes on future contributions to the 529 college savings plans. Current accounts would have been grandfathered, so existing funds could still grow and be withdrawn, tax-free.

Contributions to college savings plans are not tax-deductible at the federal level. But once the money is invested, it can grow and eventually be withdrawn with no tax on the earnings, as long as the money is spent on tuition, fees, books and supplies needed to attend post-secondary school.

The savings plans, which are sponsored by states, can also be used to prepay college tuition. 

About 12 million families take advantage of college savings plans. About half were held by families making more than $150,000, according to a 2012 report by the Government Accountability Office.

About 30 percent of plans were held by families who make less than $100,000, the report said.

Roughly 10 percent of 529 accounts are maintained by families with incomes of $50,000 or less, the College Savings Foundation told the New York Times. 

The Obama administration said all the additional revenue it obtained by taxing withdraws from 529s would have been used to help expand and make permanent a $2,500 tax credit that families can use for education expenses. Under current law, the tax credit is scheduled to expire at the end of 2017. 

The White House said Wednesday Obama's proposal to scale back the tax benefits for savings plans was just component of his overall plan to cut taxes for the middle class and to make college more affordable and tried to downplay the significance of the president's about-face.

The part affecting 529s would have only amounted to $1 billion in revenue over 10 years and was 'a small, tiny piece of a program we wanted to implement on behalf of middle class families,' White House Deputy Press Secretary Eric Schultz told reporters.

Obama is also putting forth a 'bold' $60 billion plan to make the first two years of community or technical college free. 

'He didn't want this to be a stumbling block that would jeopardize the rest of the package,' Schultz said.

Asked if the White House still stood by the 529 roll back as good policy Schultz said: 'Sure. We do.'

As they were on the flight back to the U.S. the White House was scaling back changes to the tax code the president had planned to introduce in his budget next week

House Speaker John Boehner commended the president on Tuesday evening for backing away from the proposal.

'I’m glad President Obama has decided to listen to the American people and withdraw his tax hike on college savings,' he said.

Earlier in the day, at a Capitol Hill news conference, Boehner had called on Obama to remove his plan from his budget request, due to Congress next week. 

Maine Sen. Susan Collins, a Republican, also celebrated the White House's retreat, as did the top Republican in the Senate, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.

'This is welcome news for the countless hardworking parents who make sacrifices to save and provide for their children's futures,' Collins said in a statement.

For McConnell, the disagreement with Obama over the usefulness of 529 accounts was personal.

'I fought to ensure these plans were tax-free at the federal level,' he said. 'Thanks to this incentive to save, millions of Americans use 529s to help prepare for college expenses.

'These are good plans that promote responsible savings. I’m not sure why President Obama would have sought to undermine them in the first place. It’s just good to see the president coming around to Republicans’ pro-middle class view in the end,' McConnell said in a statement.

Obama is no longer asking Congress to make changes to the college saving plans but the request will still appear in his budget next week the White House said on Wednesday.

'The announcement yesterday was made after the book was in the shop to be produced,' Schultz confessed.
