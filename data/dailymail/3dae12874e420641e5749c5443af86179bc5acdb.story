Former Liverpool owner Tom Hicks is selling his Dallas mansion for a staggering $100millon (£66.5m), although he has dropped his $135m (£90m) asking price.

The Texas businessman took control of Anfield with partner George Gillett in February 2007, but almost left the club in administration with debts of over £400m during a damaging three-and-a-half year spell.

The conduct of the pair led to rows with then manager Rafa Benitez and former chief executive Rick Parry while disgruntled fans staged large scale protests before Hicks and Gillett eventually sold the club to New England Sports Ventures in October 2010.

Hicks is now selling his home, which is  the biggest residential property in Dallas with over 50,000 square feet in the main building, a 6,400-square-foot guesthouse and a 9,194 square-foot recreation building with a full-size movie theatre in the basement. 

The 25-acre spread, which was completely rebuilt and enlarged in 2000, requires two hours just to be viewed.

'Every time I go through it I see something more – there is so much detail. This property takes things to a whole new level,' said estate agent Allie Beth Allman.

The three-story house – originally designed by Swiss architect Maurice Fatio – has a conservatory, wine cellar, media room, exercise room and a European-style kitchen with a $65,000 French range.

There's a seven-car garage and a full basement under the main house.

However, according to the Dallas Morning News, Hicks has dropped the original asking price of $135m, which made it the most expensive residential property for sale in the U.S. three years ago.
