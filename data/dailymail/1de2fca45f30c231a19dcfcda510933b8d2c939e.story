Asda is promising a five-year price war that will save shoppers £1billion.

The move follows news earlier this week that it has been overtaken by Sainsbury’ s in terms of market share, pushing it down to third in the supermarket league.

The chain is owned by America’s Wal-Mart, which is the largest and richest supermarket chain in the world, and positions itself as the cheapest of the UK’ s major grocers.

ASDA in Clapham, South London: The chain is pledging a new effort to win over shoppers by pledging to spend £1bn on keeping prices low over five years after losing its second-place market share spot to Sainsbury's

Independent research shows it is routinely cheaper than Tesco, Sainsbury’s and Morrisons, but despite this it has been losing shoppers to thriving budget chains, such as Aldi and Lidl.

The group is now pledging a new effort to win over shoppers by pledging to spend £1billion on keeping prices down over the next five years.

However, it is unclear whether this scheme will mean real reductions in the cost of putting food on the table or – more likely – efforts to curtail future rises.

The company certainly has the financial muscle to demand low prices from suppliers and make savings by buying in bulk, however shoppers have become sceptical about price cut claims.

All the major stores make great claims to offer low prices and match the deals of others, however the reality for struggling families is that food bills have risen faster than wages over the last five years.

Asda yesterday unveiled a five year strategic plan that will also include hundreds of smaller convenience stores and 1,000 click and collect sites where shoppers can pick up purchases made online.

The chain’s chief executive, Andy Clarke, said stores are performing well and sales in the July to September period were up by 0.3per cent on the previous three months.

‘We’ve continued to invest in lowering prices which has held them down for our customers while driving volume growth,’ he said. 

And he promised more action on prices, saying: ‘Looking to the longer term, we recognised some time ago that no matter whether the macro economy is slowly improving, every day finances remain under pressure and our customers have less time. Consequently, they are changing the way they live, budget and shop, to adapt to this new economic reality.

‘We regard ourselves as the UK’s leading value retailer and it is against this backdrop that I have today set out our strategic priorities which will improve, extend and expand the business over the next five years. 

‘There are three major components to this approach which will redefine value.  First, we will build on our heritage of low prices by rebasing our pricing to the tune of £1 billion.

‘Secondly, we will make a £250 million investment in quality, style and design and thirdly, we will expand Asda to reach new customers in the UK, particularly London and the South East.’
