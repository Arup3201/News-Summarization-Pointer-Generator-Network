Hatem Ben Arfa has compared his playing career to a game of Super Mario on the Nintendo – admitting he only has 'one life remaining'.

The Hull City loanee fell out favour at Newcastle during the summer and, with his contract up on Tyneside at the end of the season, will be available on a free transfer.

And, in an interview on French television, the talented but troubled 27-year-old said: 'In the past, I only thought about myself. I thought I was alone in the world. I am very fragile, too fragile.'

He added: 'Being a free agent next summer? It is huge pressure.

'I have used up all my credits. It is like playing Mario - I have one life remaining, I have to take care, but I will take on the challenge.

'Playing for one of the biggest clubs in Europe? I will achieve it.'

Ben Arfa has made four appearances for the Tigers since his deadline-day move but it yet to open his scoring account.
