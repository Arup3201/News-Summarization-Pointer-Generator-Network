A former concert pianist dubbed 'The Car Lady of Chiswick' who died homeless in a road accident has been immortalised on Google Street View.

Anne Naysmith died last week after being hit by a lorry in west London - but can be seen on the website leaning on a wall beside her trolley in an image taken six months before her death.

The 78-year-old woman once played London’s prestigious venue Wigmore Hall but spent 25 years living in a battered blue Ford Consul in Chiswick with bags covering the windows.

Homeless: For her final 13 years she slept in an alley behind an Italian restaurant, the boiler room at Charing Cross Hospital, or a tiny garden she crafted in hedges behind Stamford Brook Underground station

In the image taken last August she can be seen sitting on a wall with her trolley, wiping something off the bottom of her shoe on Prebend Gardens - where she was famous for sleeping outside.

Miss Naysmith lived in the car from the age of 29 until March 2002 when Hounslow Council towed it away because some people complained that it was an eyesore.

For her final 13 years she slept in an alley behind an Italian restaurant, the boiler room at Charing Cross Hospital, or a tiny garden she crafted in hedges behind Stamford Brook Underground station.

Google continually updates its images, taken by camera-mounted cars, but forever stores the pictures, which can be viewed by scrolling through time on the website.

One neighbour, who did not wish to be named, said of the photo: ‘It's very interesting and a fitting tribute to see her pictured where she once lived but I doubt she would've given it much thought.

Domain: Miss Naysmith lived her later life on the streets, including on land by Stamford Brook Tube station

‘She never had a computer or a mobile phone so I doubt she would've got very excited about it.’

Miss Naysmith would regularly be seen on the spot where Google's car captured her picture as it is near where she once slept in her car.

Born in the Essex seaside town of Southend-on-Sea in 1937, she was a concert pianist in the Sixties - and trained at the Royal Academy of Music. But within a very few years, her life had fallen apart and she was living in her car.

There are many theories about what triggered her fall. Some friends talk of a doomed love affair with a  chorister, while others claim she became depressed after her musical career stalled.

Sally Mates, the actress and sister of retired Conservative MP Michael Mates and a neighbour who had known Anne for 30 years, insisted it all dated back to a breakdown she suffered in 1976.

Miss Naysmith died last Tuesday, and Hounslow Council is expected to announce her funeral arrangements this week.
