David Cameron will try to form a second coalition with the Liberal Democrats if he fails to get a majority, a senior Cabinet minister has warned.

Education Secretary Nicky Morgan insisted there was ‘no alliance’ between the two coalition parties at the coming election, and said the coalition had made it more difficult for both parties to keep their promises.

She stressed that an outright Tory win was still possible - and preferable - but said the Tories would make a new deal with the Lib Dems work.

Mrs Morgan told the BBC’s Question Time programme: ‘I think if that’s what the electorate presents us with I am sure we will try and make that work. I work with (Lib Dem schools minister) David Laws in the education department on a day by day basis.’

Her comments are the clearest indication yet that the Tory leadership is laying the groundwork for a second deal with Nick Clegg if, as polls predict, the election produces another hung parliament.

The move will prove hugely controversial with some senior Tories, who believe the party should try to go it alone in minority government if it emerges from the election as the largest party at Westminster, rather than accept the inevitable compromises of coalition..

London Mayor Boris Johnson told the Daily Mail last week that Mr Cameron should categorically rule out another deal with the Lib Dems.

‘In my view we should say, “stuff coalition with anyone”, he said. ‘We are there to win, we are there to offer leadership, we are there to be a Conservative government.

‘If we go into this issuing faint pheremonal offerings or mating signals to this or that party it would be absolutely fatal.’

It raises the prospect of a repeat of the scenes in May 2010 when David Cameron and Nick Clegg entered government together

Tory MP Peter Bone yesterday said Mrs Morgan was wrong to even countenance a second coalition with the Lib Dems.

‘I don’t agree with her – I think we should try with a minority government if we fall short,’ he said. ‘Nobody has said to me, in the thousands of doors I have knocked on, that they want another coalition government.’

But a new poll of MPs conducted by Dods, suggested that almost half of Tory MPs (48 per cent) would prefer to have another coalition with the Lib Dems if the party fails to get a majority. Just 26 per cent said the party should rule out a coalition. Some 17 per cent said they would prefer a deal with Ukip.

However, the survey found that just 29 per cent of Lib Dem MPs want to do another deal with the Tories, while 43 per cent would prefer a deal with Labour and 29 per cent would prefer to avoid any coalition at all.

London Mayor Boris Johnson last week urged Mr Cameron to categorically rule out another deal with the Lib Dems

The right-wing Spectator magazine reported this week that Mr Cameron has already begun private discussions about forming a second coalition with Mr Clegg.

It said it was aware of ‘at least two detailed discussions that Cameron has had on the topic in recent weeks. He said the same in both – no matter what they might hear to the contrary, he does not want to run a minority government.’

However, the annual British Social Attitudes Report found little enthusiasm for another five years of coalition, despite broad acceptance for many of the current Government's reforms.

The NatCen survey found backing for the idea of coalition government had slumped to its lowest level for 30 years.
