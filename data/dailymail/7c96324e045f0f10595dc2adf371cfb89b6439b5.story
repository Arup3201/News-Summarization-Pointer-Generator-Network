Distinction: The new Bill will allow same sex couples to marry - but not to use adultery as grounds for divorce should their partner be unfaithful

Plans to allow same-sex couples to marry in Britain could pave the way for the concept of adultery to be abolished in law, experts have said.

Under the Government's draft Bill only infidelity between a man and a woman constitutes adultery.

So while the law would give same-sex couples the right to wed, they would not be able to divorce their partner on the basis of adultery if their spouse went on to be unfaithful - unless they cheated with somebody of the opposite sex.

It also states that a straight 
person who discovered their husband or wife had a lover of the same-sex 
could not accuse their unfaithful partner of adultery in a divorce 
court.

Lawyers and MPs have argued that the 
distinction over adultery - which arose after Government legal experts 
failed to agree on what constitutes sex between same-sex couples - 
would cause confusion.

They warned it would create 
inequality between heterosexual and homosexual married couples who found
 themselves in the divorce courts, and said it would likely result in 
adultery being abolished altogether as a grounds for divorce.

The lawyers who drafted the 
Government's Bill managed to swerve the contentious question of what 
constitutes sex between homosexual couples by adding a clause which 
states that only 'conduct' between a married person and a person of the 
opposite sex would constitute adultery.

Leading divorce lawyer Ayesha Vardag 
told the Daily Telegraph the impact of the clause could lead to the 
concept of adultery to being scrapped from law altogether.

She said abolishing the act of 
adultery as a basis for divorce would be the only 'appropriate and 
balanced' way to deal with the distinction between same sex and straight
 couples arising from the new Bill.

Confusion: The distinction between heterosexual and same-sex couples under the new Bill would lead to confusion, lawyers and MPs have said

The Government's draft Bill was published this week. David Cameron is forging ahead with the law despite fierce opposition from within the ranks of his own party.

It will give same-sex couples the right to marry in civil or religious ceremonies if the faith in question chooses to carry it out.

Culture Secretary Maria Miller, who is also minister for equalities, has said the Bill would ensure ‘equal and fair’ treatment for gay couples.

She has said the law 'protects and promotes religious freedom', allowing all religious organisations to act according to their doctrines and beliefs.

This Bill protects and promotes religious freedom, so all religious organisations can act according to their doctrines and beliefs.’

But Tory MPs who oppose the law argue there is no guarantee that faith groups and public sector workers could not be sued under equalities legislation - and be defeated in the European Court of Human Rights.

MPs are expected to debate the controversial Bill next month.
