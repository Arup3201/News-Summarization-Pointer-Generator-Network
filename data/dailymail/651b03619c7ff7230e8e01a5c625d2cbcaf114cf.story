The heiress of the Mars candy empire will face a misdemeanor charge of reckless driving following a fatal two-car crash that occurred earlier this month near her home in Virginia.

Jacqueline Badger Mars, 74, was driving
her 2004 Porsche SUV in Loudoun County on October 4 when she allegedly 
crossed the median on Route 50 and slammed into a 2013 Chrysler minivan.

A
backseat passenger in the minivan - 86-year-old 
grandmother Irene Ellisor, of Huntsville, Texas - was pronounced dead at 
the scene.

Mars was served Tuesday with a summons on Tuesday, and is expected to appear in Loudoun County General District Court at a hearing scheduled Dec. 5 at 8:30 a.m.

'As
court proceedings begin, Jackie’s thoughts and prayers remain with 
those who have suffered injury and loss,' Kent Jarrell, a personal 
spokesperson for Mars, told The Washington Post on Tuesday. 'She regrets this tragic accident.' 

Mars is one of the richest people in the world with a net worth estimated at $20.5billion and is a resident of The Plains, Virginia.

According to investigators, Mars, the granddaughter of the founder of the Mars, Inc, candy, food and beverage giant, was going westbound on Route 50 just before 2.30pm when she reportedly veered across the double yellow line near Briar Patch Lane, colliding head-on with the Chrysler minivan carrying six women.

The victim, Irene Ellisor, was reportedly not wearing a seat belt at the time of the crash. The other five occupants of the vehicle were hospitalized, among them the driver who was listed in serious condition.

Mars was rushed to Stone Springs Medical Center and later transferred to Inova Fairfax Hosptial, where she was treated for her injuries and released.

Ellisor and her companions had traveled to Virginia from Texas to attend the wedding of a relative, which was on the day of the crash.

All three are on the board of directors but are not involved in the day-to-day operations of the corporation. 

The three siblings inherited the company in 1999 after the death of their father.

Jacqueline Mars was ranked by Forbes Magazine in September as the 15th wealthiest person in the world boasting a net worth upward of $20billion.

Mars was founded in 1911 by Jacqueline
Mars' grandfather, Frank Mars, who got his business off the ground by making 
chocolates in his Tacoma, Washington, kitchen.

In 1929, the company invented the signature malt-flavored nougat, which became the filing of Milky Way and Snickers candy bars.

The sweets manufacturer is also makes M&Ms, over 400 million of which are produced in the U.S. each day.

Besides sugary treats, Mars’ extensive portfolio includes Uncle Ben's rice and pet food brands Pedigree and Whiskas.
