Lawyers for Donald Sterling have hired private investigators to dig up dirt on NBA owners and commissioners, according to a source close to the disgraced LA Clippers owner.

Four investigative firms are said to have been given a six-figure budget and 30 days to look into whether any other owners have made off-color jokes, or racist or sexist remarks.

The individual said detectives were looking at the league's finances, allegations of previous discrimination and compensation to commissioner Adam Silver and predecessor David Stern.

Sterling is suing the NBA for $1billion in federal court after the league tried to oust him as Clippers owner for making racist remarks to a girlfriend that were publicised.

A trial will be held next month to 
determine whether Sterling was properly removed as an 
administrator for the family trust that owns the team.

The sports franchise was due to be sold for $2billion by his estranged wife Shelly Sterling last month to former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer, but he is now attempting to block the deal.

A
 probate court judge in Los Angeles Wednesday denied Shelly Sterling's 
urgent request to confirm her authority as sole administrator so that she could complete the sale.

Instead,
 the judge agreed to an expedited hearing because of looming sales 
deadlines.

The development 
is the latest in a legal tug-of-war following the NBA's decision to ban 
Donald Sterling for life after racist remarks to a girlfriend were 
recorded and publicized.

Shelly Sterling, Donald's estranged wife, had been poised to sell the team for $2billion but the sale is now on hiatus

Court filings Wednesday indicated the NBA has set a hard deadline of Sept. 15. If the sale isn't completed then, the league will undertake proceedings to seize and sell the team on its own.

If that were to happen, Sterling would still receive any money from the sports franchise, but would not be able to negotiate terms.

Donald Sterling's lawyer, Bobby Samini, left the courthouse without comment after a clerk announced the trial schedule. Neither Sterling was present.

'I just want to resolve this as quickly as possible,' NBA Commissioner Adam Silver told The Associated Press on Wednesday in Miami at an NBA Cares event.
