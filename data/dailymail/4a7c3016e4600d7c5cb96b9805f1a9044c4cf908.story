Officials in Florida released Thursday a surveillance video showing Heisman Trophy winner Jameis Winston shoplifting crab legs from a Tallahassee supermarket.

The silent clip recorded inside a Publix grocery store April 29 shows the Florida State University star football player sauntering into the supermarket dressed in shorts and sandals, and heading to the back.

Winston, 20, could be seen picking up a $32.72 order of crab legs and craw fish served on a trey wrapped in plastic from the seafood counter.

Caught on camera: Officials in Florida released this surveillance video showing FSU quarterback Jameis Winston, 20, leaving a Publix supermarket without paying for an order of crab legs and crawfish

Watchful eye: Winston dressed in black is seen picking up a $32.72 order of seafood from a counter (left) and then heading to the dairy section for butter

He then stops by the dairy section to pick up a pack of butter and heads out the door after allegedly waiting for an off-duty sheriff's deputy to pass.

Winston told deputies he walked out and forgot to pay for 3lbs worth of Old Bay seasoned steamed crab legs and a pound of Cajun seasoned crawfish.

But he said he didn't take the butter. He said he decided on the way out of the store that he didn't need it and placed it in a sale bin instead of returning it to the dairy cooler.

Leon County Sheriff's Deputy Michael Crego who reviewed the security video wrote in a report released last week that the quarterback and FSU baseball closer appeared to hang back at the exit to avoid walking in front of a law enforcement official.

‘Mr. Winston paused visibly near a series of sale bins and allowed Deputy Graves to pass in front of him. The pause appeared to be an attempt to avoid walking in front of Deputy Graves,’ Crego wrote

‘Mr. Winston then walked behind Deputy Graves, passed all points of sale, and exited the store without paying for the merchandise.’

The report goes on to state that deputies were unable to determine whether Winston took the butter or placed it in the sale bin.

Winston signed a civil citation admitting he committed petit theft and was suspended from FSU's baseball team for three games until he completed 20 hours of community service.

‘Mr. Winston apologized repeatedly and stated he wanted to “make it right,"’ Crego wrote.

The 20-year-old Alabama native has also released an apology.

'I went to the supermarket with the intent to purchase dinner but made a terrible mistake for which I'm taking full responsibility,' Winston said in a statement April 30 after news of his misdeed--and punishment--had quickly spread.

Quarterback Jameis Winston #5 of the Florida State Seminoles pictured here after the 2014 Rose Bowl victory over Auburn, is likely not currently celebrating after news broke Wednesday of a criminal citation he received Tuesday for allegedly shoplifting crab legs from a Florida grocery store

'In a 
moment of youthful ignorance, I walked out of the store without paying 
for one of my items,' continued the youngest ever Heisman winner. 'I 
realize that I am in the public spotlight and my conduct needs to be 
above reproach.'

Officials pointed out that the college student made no attempt to contact the supermarket and alert someone at Publix to his mistake.

Winston has had 
previous run-ins with the law, including a 2013 investigation over an 
alleged rape for which he was never charged.

'Over the last year I've learned that my accomplishments on the fields can be a wonderful thing for my school, teammates, friends, and family,' the athlete's statement said. 'At the same time, I must realize that my mistakes are magnified and can bring great embarrassment to all those who support me every day.'

Winston was not arrested. Unless he fails to show up to community service, his record will remain clean.

'He got an adult civil citation,' a police source told Tomahawk Nation of the arrest alternative usually reserved for juveniles.

'If he completes the sanctions it will never show up on his record,' said the source. 'They are now doing it for minor misdemeanors for adults to lower crime rate.'

The source also revealed the quarterback will be fined $30.

No arrests: The current Heisman trophy holder also has an impressive record pitching for his school's baseball team, but he has a history of near misses with the law outside the alleged seafood incident

The incident allegedly occurred at a Publix, a staple in Florida grocery stores

According
 to the SB Nation report, Winston was once investigated by police after a
 Burger King employee accused him of stealing soda using a ketchup cup.

He also faced police questioning for an alleged involvement in a long-running BB gun battle, SB Nation reports.

News of Winston's wrongdoings come just weeks after the NCAA changed its rules to allow colleges to offer their athletes as much free food as they want.

There was previously a cap placed at three free meals per day.

The announced rule change came after Connecticut basketball guard Shabazz Napier's announcement during the Final Four in which he complained of players 'starving.'

Hungry: UConn guard Shabazz Napier complained early in April that he often goes to bed hungry because he can't afford food. Days later, the NCAA announced a lifting of restrictions on free food provided to college athletes

It was unclear if Winston was able to take advantage of the rule at the time of his encounter with authorities.

Winston is the nation's top-rated passer 
and has led the top-ranked Seminoles (13-0) to a spot in the BCS 
championship game against No. 2 Auburn on Jan. 6, his birthday. The 
former five-star recruit from Bessemer, Alabama, made college football 
look easy from his very first game.

On Labor Day night, on national television, Winston went 25 for 27 for 356 yards and four touchdowns in a victory at Pittsburgh.

'I
 can't explain how truly intelligent he is,' Florida State coach Jimbo 
Fisher said. 'He always wanted to know why he had success or why he had 
failure so he could either repeat it or fix it.'

There
 wasn't much failure on the way to becoming the third Seminoles 
quarterback to win the Heisman. The last was Chris Weinke in 2000.

Winston and
 Florida State were cruising toward an undefeated season when news broke
 of an unresolved sexual assault complaint against him made to the 
Tallahassee Police Department last December.

The
 dormant case was handed over to the state attorney's office for a full 
investigation. A female student at Florida State accused Winston of 
rape. Winston's attorney said the sex was consensual.

During
 three weeks of uncertainty, Winston continued to play sensationally, 
while other contenders stumbled or failed to distinguish themselves.
