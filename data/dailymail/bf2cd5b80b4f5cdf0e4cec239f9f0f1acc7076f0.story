A group of California children are protesting the removal of a beloved neighborhood alligator taken away by state fish and wildlife authorities.

Though some may consider a 125 pound alligator intimidating, the children in Rancho Cucamonga say that they don't feel right without the creature, named Chopper, penned on neighbor Chris Cassaro's property.

'We just really want her back, so bad that it's not even funny,' said neighbor Braden Zazueta.

Roughly a dozen California children and parents held a sit-in to get alligator 'Chopper' back Friday

At 125 pounds, Chopper has lived with her owner in the neighborhood since 1987

They rallied on behalf of Cassaro's pet's return with signs reading 'Bring Chopper Home' and 'Bring Back Our Gator.'

Roughly a dozen neighbors held a sit-in to get Chopper back Friday.

Parents at the demonstration said Chopper gave their children an experience no other neighborhood could replicate.

'Most children go their whole lives without that opportunity, our neighborhood's been blessed. So to have her taken from us, it's a complete betrayal, in a sense, to our whole entire neighborhood,' Amber Parks told reporters.

Chopper had been on Cassaro's property since 1987.

'I never had children,' he told KTLA. 'She is my child.'

Owner Chris Cassaro says Chopper is the closest he has to a child

California Department of Fish and Wildlife officials took Chopper and two venomous snakes from Cassaro on Thursday.

They told him it was not legal to own the animals.

Cassaro said he had a permit and did everything he could to make sure he was caring for Chopper legally.

'I worked with the city of Rancho Cucamonga for almost a year, jumping through their hoops, doing their conditions, getting my neighbors in agreement,' he told reporters.

Officials said he was unable to find that permit when they came for Chopper, but even if Cassaro had produced it they still would have removed the animals.

California lists alligators as restricted animals and said Cassaro failed to have a special state permit for Chopper

California has alligators on its list of restricted species and would need a special state license to keep her.

As he did not have one, he would likely never be able to keep Chopper again.

Cassaro's neighbors are sympathetic.

'She's been living here 30 years, I think she should live here 30 more because it's just her home. Everybody has grown to know her and love her,' said Hunter Oslund.
