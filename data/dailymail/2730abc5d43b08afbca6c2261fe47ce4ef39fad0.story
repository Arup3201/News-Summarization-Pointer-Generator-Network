John Terry is going to cause Chelsea a huge problem in the future and the cost to fix it will be enormous.

There will come a point one day when Jose Mourinho is no longer able to rely on his captain and, privately, he will be dreading when that time comes. The term to describe Terry’s influence on this Chelsea team is the same as the one you would label his performance at Wembley: colossal.

Mourinho’s brilliance as a manager cannot be overstated. Wherever he goes, he is successful and he has won trophies with any number of different players. Some managers need big individuals to get them over the line but Mourinho does it regardless of who he is working with.

John Terry's current form for Chelsea is arguably as impressive as it was 10 years ago

Terry scored the opening goal of the game in the recent Capital One Cup Final win against Tottenham 

Premier League: 2004-05, 2005-06, 2009-10.

FA Cup: 1999-00, 2006-07, 2008-09, 2009-10, 2011-12. 

League Cup: 2004-05, 2006-07, 2014-15.

Community Shield: 2005, 2009.

Champions League: 2011-12.

Europa League: 2012-13. 

With Terry, however, the case is different. When Chelsea won the League Cup 10 years ago — the first of the five trophies they lifted during Mourinho’s first reign — the side was built around a formidable spine of Petr Cech, Terry, Claude Makelele, Frank Lampard and Didier Drogba.

All those players have been subsequently replaced with one notable exception. Terry was as good against Tottenham as he was against Liverpool at the Millennium Stadium in 2005 and you have to ask when the time comes to fill his shoes, what will the price be?

When you think Manchester City paid £32million for Eliaquim Mangala last summer and David Luiz cost Paris Saint-Germain £50m, you get an idea of how difficult it will be to find someone with Terry’s many qualities.

On these pages 14 months ago, I described Terry as the best defender in Barclays Premier League history and one moment towards the end of the game on Sunday showed why he has stayed at the top of his profession for so long.

The game was won but Tottenham were looking to grab a consolation and it looked like it might arrive when Harry Kane wriggled into the area. He was denied, though, by Terry putting his body on the line to make sure Chelsea’s goal wasn’t threatened.

During the World Cup last summer, I complained that there was a lack of great central defenders playing now — the type who will do the dirty work and would kill for a clean sheet. Terry is one of the remaining few.

As a player, I hold him in the highest regard and his consistency has been remarkable. Sometimes I don’t think it gets appreciated how difficult it is to stay at one club for your entire career, especially in the position John has filled. I know what it is like to get beyond 30 and have people writing you off on the basis of your age, the constant questioning of ‘Is he the same as he used to be?’. A bad game and the scrutiny comes on you.

There is an added pressure for defenders. When you are not at your best, you know that one mistake and you will be the one who costs the team the game; midfielders or strikers can be taken off but as a defender there is nowhere to hide.

But John has never hidden, not even after the campaign two years ago when he made just 14 appearances. This season he is up to 36 and playing as well as he has ever done, leaving some to ask whether he could play for England again.

Wisely, he has ended such talk. He might be the best English defender but he is not needed for the Euro 2016 qualification campaign, as England have already qualified. The extra recovery time he now has between games helps his form and who is to say he will be playing so well in 18 months anyway? The future for England is players such as John Stones and Calum Chambers.

Concentrating on Chelsea is best for him. He is yet to sign a deal but I don’t for one moment expect the Stamford Bridge hierarchy to let him slip out of the club. He is too valuable and given how Mourinho sets his team up, he could play for at least another two years.

Gary Cahill and Kurt Zouma are good players but without Terry, I would not be confident about Chelsea winning the Premier League next season.

If he was to leave, there would not be a team in the top flight who Terry would not improve. Mourinho knows this better than anyone.

People underestimate how hard it is to stay at a top club for so long

Jose Mourinho knows the value of Terry and won't let him leave
