The U.S. ambassador to Russia has announced that he is stepping down after two turbulent years in Moscow.

Michael McFaul, a longtime Stanford University professor-turned-diplomat, will be returning to California, following his family who moved back to their home state last year.

'We tried to make a 9,000 kilometer commute work for our family. But after seven months of separation, I simply need to be with my family again,' he said in a statement.

Leaving: Michael McFaul, a former professor, said that he always planned to leave academia for only two years and now he is at the five-year mark

The ambassador announced his departure in a blog post on Tuesday, saying he would leave after the Sochi Winter Olympics.

Mr McFaul, 50, is considered the architect of President Barack Obama's effort to reset relations with Russia.

Though U.S.-Russian relations are the iciest over the past two years as they have been since the Cold War, but Mr McFaul defended his time as a diplomat.

Even Mr McFaul did not try to smooth over the troublesome years, presenting a laundry list of problems that have arisen between the two countries- and placing the blame for each squarely in Russia's corner.

'I also am proud of the work we had to do to manage some difficult issues in U.S.-Russia relations over the past few years,' he wrote in a blog post Tuesday.

Tense: McFaul's term marked a rising sense of anti-Americanism, and also coincided with the return of Vladimir Putin to political power (seen at left today with a Persian leopard in a rehabilitation park near Sochi)

Close: McFaul worked in Washington for President Obama for three years before going to Russia

'The Russian ban on adoptions by American parents, the Russian order to close the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) operations in Russia, false claims in the Russian media about American desires to foment revolution in Russia and U.S. foreign policy aims in general, the growing pressures on Russian civil society and independent media, the granting of temporary asylum to Edward Snowden, and our different assessments of the causes and consequences of political change in the Middle East and Ukraine are just some of the challenges that we have been compelled to manage,' he wrote in the post.

'Yet, I leave Russia with a strong feeling of satisfaction for how our administration handled these issues without compromising our interests or values.'

Familial obligations: McFaul's family lived in Russia with him for the first half of his tenure but has since returned to California

McFaul says that negotiation of a new strategic arms treaty and cooperation on the NATO-led military campaign in Afghanistan are two of the clearest signs of success.

'Since we set out to reset relations with Russia five years ago (yes, I am not afraid to use the word “reset”!), we have achieved a lot,' he wrote.

His tenure has also been marked by rising anti-Americanism in Russia that accompanied Vladimir Putin's return to the presidency.

'I will leave Russia reluctantly. I love this job. It is a tremendous honor to represent my country here. I will miss interacting with my partners in the Russian government and with Russians from all sectors of society and business,' he wrote.
