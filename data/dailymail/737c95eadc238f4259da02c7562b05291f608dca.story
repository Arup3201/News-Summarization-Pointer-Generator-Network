Demonstrators said they are dealing with the sexual assault of a woman internally after she was attacked by a man in her tent in the early hours of the morning.

It is the second alleged sexual assault at the camp, which organisers have warned is attracting prisoners straight out of Rikers, but have refused to call police.

The woman was in her tent at around 6am yesterday when the man burst into her tent and attacked her.

Problem camp: The protesters have said that they will handle the sexual assault internally rather than call in police

Actress Joan Rivers has highlighted the lack of gay protesters at Occupy Wall Street and told all the demonstrators to ‘get jobs and go back to work’.

The LGBT advocate said gay men have ‘better bodies on the whole’ and care more about their appearance.

‘Very seldom will you find a gay schlep,’ she told New York Magazine. ‘This is why there are no gay protestors in Zuccotti Park. Because there’s no place to change and no closets.’

Other critics have also pointed out the lack of minority groups appearing at the protests.

Fellow protesters surrounded the man and
 shone flashlights in his face before chasing him out of Zuccotti park 
where they are staying.

'We don't tell anyone, we handle it internally,' a protester told the New York Post, adding that another woman was raped weeks earlier.

She said that fellow protesters were 'yelling at him to leave,' shouting 'pervert, pervert, get the f**k out.'

Organisers have raised concerns that the camp is becoming a refuge for homeless people and is attracting convicts fresh out of Rikers prison.

Cold: The protesters, who were drenched by snow and rain over the weekend, are reportedly 'in need of emergency supplies'

Pat Buchanan today warned the Occupy Wall Street protest is 'going to end very, very badly with these folks in the winter'.

Speaking on 'The McLaughlin Group' he said that he expects the demonstrations to become violent as the weather gets worse.

'They’re not going to be getting publicity and they’re going to be acting up and acting badly like the worst of the demonstrators in the ’60s,' said the former senior adviser to presidents Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford and Ronald Reagan.

'They’re going to start fighting with the cops.'

'They're telling people who leave prison
 to go to Zuccotti park, ' Daniel Zetah, leader of the Occupy Wall 
Street community-relations group told the newspaper.

The
 newly-released criminals are thought be attracted by the free 
accommodation and food, and reported alcohol and drug-fuelled parties 
taking place at the site.

'There's a lot of drugs, alcohol, assault [and] theft [by] the homeless groups coming in. We've had meetings all day to brainstorm what to do,' Mr Zetah said.

The cold weather is continuing to plague the protesters, who have had their gas-powered generators confiscated by fire department as they are seen as a safety risk.

Organisers have put out an 'urgent' alert on their website asking for waterproof boots, hats and gloves.

The protesters, who were drenched by snow and rain over the weekend, are reportedly 'in need of emergency supplies crucial for cold weather survival'.

They also want cots so that 
demonstrators can get off the ground and are looking for thermal heaters
 after the generators were taken.

Three protesters have been taken to hospital with cold-related ailments.

Some protesters say they will defiantly remain, no matter how bad the weather gets though.

'Bring on the snow,' Chris Guerra, 27, told the Post. 'This is day 30, and I say bring it on. I'm not leaving until the sun dies or Jesus Christ returns.'

Occupy Wall Street has reportedly raised $454,000 in donations. So far around $50,000 has been spent on clothing, food and medical supplies.

And as a massive snowstorm dumped the white stuff on New York City at the weekend, footage from thermal imaging cameras taken late at night showed the resolve of protesters huddled inside tents.
