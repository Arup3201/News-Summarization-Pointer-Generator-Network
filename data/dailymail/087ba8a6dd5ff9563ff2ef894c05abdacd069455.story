This adorable photo shows a tiny baby limosa harlequin frog sat on an American quarter.

The endangered frogs have been given a new lease of life after The Panama Amphibian Rescue and Conservation Project successfully bred the frogs for the first time.

The rescue project is raising nine healthy frogs from one mating pair and hundreds of tadpoles from another pair.

Cute! This picture shows a tiny baby limosa harlequin frog, an endangered species native to Panama, sitting atop a U.S. quarter coin. Researchers have successfully bred the chevron-patterned variety for the first time

'The last hope for their species': The Panama Amphibian Rescue and Conservation Project is raising nine healthy frogs from one mating pair and hundreds of tadpoles from another pair

Threatened: Habitat loss, climate change, pollution, and a virulent fungal disease called chytridiomycosis are all thought to have contributed to the loss of 94 of 120 frog species since as late as 1980

'These frogs represent the last hope for their species,' said Brian Gratwicke of the Smithsonian Biology Institute, international coordinator for the conservation project, in a statement.

'This new generation is hugely inspiring to us as we work to conserve and care for this species and others.'

With nearly one-third of the world's amphibian species at risk of extinction, the project aims to save frog species in Panama, one of the world's last remaining strongholds for amphibian biodiversity.

Habitat loss, climate change, pollution, and a virulent fungal disease called chytridiomycosis are all thought to have contributed to the loss of 94 of 120 frog species since as late as 1980.

Rescue efforts: The Panama rescue project currently cares for 55 adult limosa harlequin frogs of the chevron-patterned form and a further ten of the plain-coloured form at two research centres

Complicated needs: Each species requires its own special care to thrive and breed, with researchers having only limited success in encouraging the plain-coloured form to multiply

It is hoped that methodologies may be developed to reduce the impact of the amphibian chytrid fungus so that one day their captive communities can be returned to the wild

The Panama rescue project currently cares for 55 adult limosa harlequin frogs of the chevron-patterned form and a further ten of the plain-coloured form at two research centres in the Central American country.

Each species requires its own special care to thrive and breed, with researchers having only limited success in encouraging the plain-coloured form to multiply.

Both kinds need highly oxygenated, gently flowing warm water between 22C and 24C for their tadpoles to survive.

Their natural food is algal film growing on submerged rocks, which researchers replicated by painting petri dishes with a solution of powdered spirulina algae and then allowing it to dry.

It is hoped that one day the teams working for the project may develop methodologies to reduce the impact of the amphibian chytrid fungus so that one day their captive communities can be returned to the wild.
