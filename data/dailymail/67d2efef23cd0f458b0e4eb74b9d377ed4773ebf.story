The iPhone 5: New details have emerged of the budget version of Apple's iconic smartphone that the firm is rumoured to be working on

Apple will launch a new, plastic bodied version of the iPhone at a budget price as early as this year, it has been claimed.

The long-awaited budget iPhone will just £220 ($330), according to reports - roughly half the cost of a full-blown version of the iconic smartphone.

It is understood that it will be enclosed in a glossy polycarbonate plastic case, much like the one found on the now-discontinued entry-level MacBook.

It has long been rumoured that Apple is preparing a cheaper version of its flagship mobile product, in an attempt to increase the company's penetration into emerging markets.

Details of the budget iPhone were published yesterday by Japanese blog Macotakara, which claimed Apple was to defer the release of a larger-screened successor to the iPhone 5, but may soon launch a less expensive handset.

It suggests that the budget iPhone will be be given a launch price of just $330 - similar to the iPad mini -  in order to appeal to young, middle class consumers in countries like China and India.

The entry-level phone will also be thicker than the iPhone 5, Macotakara reports, to make its polycarbonate body more durable, and could come in a variety of colours.

However, the design of the cheaper iPhone is said to be similar to its costlier siblings, including a home button beneath its LCD display.

That means a patent granted the company in January which showed a phone with no home button is likely not the design for the scaled-down smart phone, as was previously speculated.

Earlier this month Apple CEO Tim Cook let slip during a rare interview that an affordable iPhone might be in development.

'We are making moves to make things more affordable': Comments made by Apple CEO Tim Cook last month seemed to suggest that the company was working on a cheaper equivalent to the iPhone for emerging markets

iPhone covers shaped like knuckledusters that sold in their thousands after Rihanna was seen using one have been banned from eBay in case they are used to attack people.

The £25 aluminium case became a celebrity must-have after the singer, pictured right, was pictured with hers last year.

But eBay has removed the web pages of sellers, saying the cases are legally classed as weapons and breach its guidelines.

However, flimsier plastic versions are still for sale.

'We are making moves to make things more affordable,' he said at the Goldman Sachs technology and internet conference in San Francisco.

The revelation came after Mr Cook said that he saw a 'wide open field' because Apple's iPhone was currently 'only available to 50 per cent of [mobile phone] subscribers in the world'.

Asked whether the problem might be that only 50 per cent could afford an iPhone, Mr Cook said: 'Good question.  Our North Star is "great products" - we would never do something that isn't a great product, that's not why we're on this earth.

'That said, if you look at what we've done to appeal to people that are price sensitive — lower price of iPhone 4, iPhone 4S, in most recent quarter, not enough supply of iPhone 4 - surprised us.'

Apple has not unveiled another trailblazing product since Mr Cook took over, raising concerns about whether the company is losing the ingenuity that has set it apart from the rest of the technology pack.

Analysts have said that the Californian firm should make a cheaper smartphone to gain more of a foothold in the important Chinese market.
