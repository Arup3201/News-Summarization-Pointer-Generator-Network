The humble Cornish pasty has been hailed as this year's big hit at a top food festival in France.

The West Country staple was the surprise star of the renowned event in the city of Lorient in Brittany, which attracts 60,000 people including some of the continent's top gastronomes and chefs.

The area's leading newspaper, Le Telegramme, declared the humble pasty as 'the revelation of the festival'.

The baked pastries were made by Cornwall's Trevithick Bakery, one of several UK firms serving up traditional British fare including jams, pastries and craft beers.

'The Lorient Festival is an important platform to attract people to Cornwall,' Julian German, Cornwall Council cabinet member for economy & culture, told Business Cornwall. 'It is evident that many people have heard of Cornwall and we need show what Cornwall has to offer.

'Our environment, our heritage and culture, our food and drink, are strong reasons why people decide to come to Cornwall and they are not weather dependent.

'Cornwall has much to offer and we need to make sure that we are actively participating on the international stage to ensure that everyone knows this.'

In 2011, the Cornish pasty joined products such as champagne and Parma ham when it was awarded Protected Geographical Indication status.

The European Commission award means the food can only be made in Cornwall using a strict traditional recipe.

Official guidelines require that the pasties must be prepared in Cornwall, have a ‘D’ shape and be crimped on one side.

The
rules also state the slow-baked pasty should have a 'chunky filling' of
uncooked minced or roughly cut chunks of beef (not less than 12.5 per 
cent) along with swede, potato, onion with a light seasoning and no 
additives or preservatives.

Pastry
casing is golden in colour, glazed with milk or egg and 'robust enough 
to retain its shape throughout the cooking and cooling process without 
splitting or cracking'.
