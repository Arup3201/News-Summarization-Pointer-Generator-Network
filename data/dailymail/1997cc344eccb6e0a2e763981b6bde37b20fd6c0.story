These images capture Belorussian villagers performing a unique and unusual ritual from the 18th Century - but a heritage organisation has warned it is dying out.

The 'Kalyady Tsars' (Christmas Tsars) is a festive event celebrated in the village of Semezhevo in the 
Minsk region of Belarus.

It now takes place only in this village and is performed to celebrate the New Year, which is January 13 according to the archaic Julian calendar.

Folklore: Villagers perform the Christmas Tsars rite in the village of Semezhevo in Belarus

Heritage: More than 500 performers, mostly young boys and men, take part in the annual event

But UNESCO, the cultural watchdog of the United Nations, has added it to its List of Intangible Cultural Heritage in Need of Urgent Safeguarding as interest in the event dwindles.

The rite of the Kolyady Tsars dates back
to the 18th century, when the tsar’s military units were stationed not 
far from Semezhevo.

According to the local legend, during
the New Year celebrations 
soldiers and officers visited local houses to give comic performances 
and receive rewards.

Since then, locals continued the tradition and 
turned it into a unique Christmas event.

The rite originates from when the Tsar's forces would come to the village to celebrate the Julian calendar New Year

About 500 men participate annually in the event, seven of which are chosen to play the roles of the Christmas Tsars.

They dress in white trousers and shirts,
with red embroidered belts crisscrossed across their chests, 
and high caps adorned with colorful paper ribbons.

Other characters such as the dzad (old man) and baba (old lady), are played by a young girl and boy respectively.

During the drama, ‘tsars’ visit the local houses of unmarried girls to give comic performances and receive good wishes and awards. The procession continues into the night, lit by torchlight.

It incorporates performing arts, costumes, art and even special dishes, but the younger generation are starting to lose interest in the event.

Lost history: Unesco fears the ritual is dying out as the younger generation is not joining in

Rebirth: The Christmas Tsars was resurrected in 1996 after history experts pieced the performance together from oral history and documents

A Unesco statement said: 'At present, the ceremony, although popular with older residents, is diminishing in popularity with the younger generation.

'This may result in a gap in transmission of knowledge regarding the production of costumes, instruments, interior decorations and particular dishes associated with the event – intangible heritage that may not outlast the present generation of residents.'

People believe that being visited by the 'tsars' brings peace, harmony and wealth for a year.

The rite was revived in 1996 after proceedings were reconstructed from documents and interviews with older members of the community.
