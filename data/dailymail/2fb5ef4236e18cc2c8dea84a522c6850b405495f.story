Her fitness DVD has become the fastest-selling of all time but Charlotte Crosby has admitted she hasn't always loved exercising.

The 24-year-old Geordie Shore star appeared on today's This Morning to share the secrets to her success after she has shed two-and-a-half stone in seven months.

She believes if she can drop four dresses sizes, anyone can - as she wasn't a healthy eater or gym bunny before her recent health kick.

Charlotte Crosby admitted she used to drink pints of Baileys on today's This Morning

Transformation: Eamonn Holmes brought out a cardboard cutout of how the reality star used to look before she shed two-and-a-half stone through diet and exercise

'I've changed my lifestyle to be healthier. I still drink but I've cut it down, I used to have pints of Baileys, I loved it,' she told presenters Eamonn Holmes and Ruth Langsford.

The Irish cream has 13g of fat per 100ml so cutting pints of it from her diet has made a huge difference to her waistline, along with eating a diet lower in fat.

The reality TV star from Sunderland said exercise was also a key factor in helping her go from a dress size 16 to 8.

She said learning to love keeping fit was a challenge as she'd always felt self-conscious when working out. 

The fitness DVD has become the fastest selling in the UK since its Boxing Day release

She said: 'Before I didn't do any exercise. I did not want to go to gym, I felt intimated as I didn't know what I was doing and I felt like people were staring at me.'

But since teaming up with personal trainer Richard Callender, Charlotte has transformed both her body and her mindset.

She said: 'The exercise was difficult at first but I'm so strong now, I could carry you both on my back,' she joked to the presenters.

The workouts Charlotte does with Richard and her eating plan, devised by weight loss expert David Souter, is revealed on her DVD 'Charlotte Crosby's 3 Minute Belly Blitz' which has become a huge success.

The Official Chart Company revealed earlier this month that it has become the UK's fastest-selling fitness DVD of all time following its Boxing Day release. 

Charlotte said she's delighted with the sales and hopes it can help other people get into shape like she did.

She said: 'I can't believe it's fastest selling fitness DVD, I'm so proud and happy to be inspiration to people.'

But while Eamonn and Ruth were quick to praise Charlotte's new figure - bringing out a cardboard cutout of the 'big old you' to compare her size - she said not everyone has showered her with compliments.

'I don't know Gaz's reaction,' she said of her ex-boyfriend Gaz Beadle, with whom she's had a stormy on-off relationship on Geordie Shore.

'He never tells us out of spite, I think,' she revealed, 'He doesn't want to give me a compliment.'

The pair will be reunited on the new series of MTV reality show Ex On The Beach.
