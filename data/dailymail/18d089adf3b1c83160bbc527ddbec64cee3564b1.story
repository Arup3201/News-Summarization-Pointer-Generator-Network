A volunteer police officer in California has been placed on administrative leave after posting a video to YouTube expressing her hate of bicyclists on the road during her free time.

Laura Weintraub, of Calabasas, has built up a minor following on the video sharing site through a series of self-made clips called 'Cup Holder Commentary'.

The outspoken blonde films herself in the car giving her opinions of everything from gym etiquette 

But her latest vent resulted in a suspension from the Santa Paula Police Department, causing controversy for saying: 'I hate bicyclists, every single one of them.'

Outspoken: Laura Weintraub, a reserve police officer with Santa Paula Police Department in California, has been placed on administrative leave for a video she posted to YouTube as part of her 'Cup Holder Commentary' series

Weintraub was not on-duty at the time and does not identify herself as an officer in the video.

However in one part of the clip she asks the driver of the car, her husband, how much she'd have to pay for him to run over a cyclist.

The clip also finishes with a shot of an iconic image of a horrific 2008 bike crash in Mexico, in which a drunk driver plowed into a group of people in a race, killing one and injuring at least 10 others.

The caption read: 'Like you've never thought about it ...'

The video found its way to the station's Facebook page and did not bode well with Weintraub's bosses, NBC San Diego reported.

On Saturday, a post from the Department said Weintraub had been placed on administrative leave.

'The purpose of this post is to notify the community that the volunteer who made the video about cyclist has been placed on Administrative Leave pending an investigation,' the post said.

A second reserve officer was also placed on administrative leave for posting a response to comments on the Department's Facebook page.

The video was deleted from Weintraub's YouTube page as of Saturday morning, but at least one other user saved and posted it to their page.
