At some point on Wednesday in all probability, Rory McIlroy will walk away from Dublin’s High Court with his bank balance badly dented but with a weight off his mind. Best of all, he will be free to concentrate on his preparations for the Masters.

What was supposed to be a day setting out the issues at stake in his bitter dispute with his former management company Horizon Sports Management turned into one where his senior counsel Paul Gallagher spoke for a total of less than two minutes.

Three times he asked for adjournments, arguing they were making progress towards a settlement of a case that is due to last for eight weeks. Three times the judge, Mr Justice Brian Cregan, quickly granted his request, with the sides due back in court at 11am on Wednesday. In all, Mr Justice Cregan spent less time in court than Jim Furyk spends over the ball.

Only those well versed in legal ways could possibly explain why an acrimonious struggle that has gone back and forth for 18 months could possibly be settled in 24 hours. 

One thing for sure is that a swift settlement will suit McIlroy, even if it does cost him a not-so-small fortune. Florida, here he comes.

The world No 1 arrived in the Round Hall reception area that serves four small courts wearing a dark suit and glasses. He was relaxed enough to acknowledge the gathering of golf correspondents with a broad smile that could be interpreted as: fancy meeting you here.

McIlroy was in impressive form in Dubai but now has another challenge to face at the High Court in Dublin 

Inside the intimate courtroom there were barely 50 feet separating those sitting in the back benches from the presiding judge. 

There was a genuine sense of drama as the room fell silent two minutes before the appointed starting hour, followed by the arrival of Mr Justice Cregan.

Mr Gallagher SC rose to his feet. ‘The case is listed for eight weeks and there are many issues between the two sides,’ he said, referring to the fact McIlroy was suing for being locked into an ‘unconscionable’ contract until 2017, and Horizon’s owner Conor Ridge was countersuing for unpaid fees. 

The sports management firm are also counter-suing McIlroy for £1.65m for severing his contract early

‘Along with Mr Paul Sreenan (senior counsel for Ridge), we would like to see if we can narrow many of these issues down and that we adjourn until 2pm.’

Couldn’t they have done all this on Monday and spared everyone having to turn up? By the time of the final adjournment and a day as tedious as a rain delay, Ridge was looking noticeably more relaxed.

Given he’s already turned down the offer of a €10million (£7.57m) settlement, he’s surely going to be a very wealthy man by the end of play. And, as McIlroy said last week in Dubai: ‘Then we can all get on with the rest of our lives.’
