Rapist: Salvafor Orozco was jailed today for nine years after being convicted of rape

A rapist has been jailed for nine years because of forensic evidence preserved by his victims thanks to an EastEnders storyline 25 years ago.

Salvador Orozco, 49, dragged his victim off the street and subjected her to a brutal sexual attack in Gateshead in 1990.

He fled to Hawaii and evaded justice for more than two decades, until new technology allowed him to identified and brought back to the UK for trial.

During the trial his victim, who was 20 at the time of the attack, told jurors at Newcastle Crown Court that the vital evidence which led to his conviction was only preserved because she remembered an Eastenders storyline.

When character Kathy Beale, played by Gillian Taylforth, was raped by James Willmott-Brown, in 1988, her attacker was convicted in part because she knew to write down a comprehensive account, and to avoid washing to preserve evidence on her body.

She said: “Kathy had been raped by Willmott-Brown and I remember watching the story.

'I knew I had not to have a shower or bath and I knew it was important to remember as much as I could.'

The court heard that during the attack Orozco has put on an oriental accent, saying :'My name’s Sushi. It’s Japanese.'

He was living in Gateshead at the time and working as a doorman at a club before making the attack on 17 May not far from Gateshead Metro Station.

After the attack the victim rushed 
home and her husband discovered her wrapped in a duvet in the living 
room, Newcastle Crown Court heard.

Inspiration: This scene from a 1988 episode of EastEnders, in which character Kathy Beale is raped by James Willmott-Brown ensured that the victim preserved the evidence of the assault

Her
injuries were so severe that she could not be examined at first but 
samples were taken from her which would ultimately lead to the 
conviction of Orozco.

He was extradited from his home in Hawaii earlier this year on the strength of the forensic evidence, which was able to be used after a cold case review six years ago.

At court Orozco claimed that he had had consensual sex with the woman, but he was convicted of rape by the jury. He was cleared of attempted buggery and jurors were unable to reach a decision on a charge of indecent assault.

Sentencing today, Judge John Milford said: 'I find it very unlikely that a 20-year-old married woman would choose to engage in consensual relations with a complete stranger that she had just met.

'The complainant to me was an honest woman. You on the other-hand did not give a favourable impression and gave me no doubt about how this started.

Attack: The then 20-year-old was on her way home in May 1990 when she claims Orozco dragged her from the Gateshead Metro Station and brutally raped her

'You grabbed her from behind, dragged her into a yard and detained her against her will in a state of abject terror. The effect this rape has had on the victim was very considerable.

'She was unable to live in her marital home, she was unable to return to her job and this incident had a most damaging effect on her marriage.

'That marriage broke down.'

After the sentence his victim said: 'I really want to thank everyone: friends, family, police and 
victim support. I could not have got through the last 23 years without 
their ongoing support.

'I
want my case to give hope to other victims of rape; just because the 
offender is not caught or prosecuted at the time does not mean you won't
get justice in the future.'

Nicola Musgrove of Northumbria Police said: 'This was a particularly violent offence of a stranger rape which has had a lasting impact not only upon the victim, but was also remembered by the officers who investigated the crime 23 years ago.

Justice: Orozco was handed a nine-year jail sentence at Newcastle Crown Court today

'This case shows that together with our partners in the CPS, we are committed to doing all we can to bring offenders to justice.

'The verdict sends a clear message to offenders of these types of crime that there is no hiding place and we are determined to support victims to seek justice and help them to achieve closure after they have suffered such serious crimes.

'Crimes of this nature are unusual and I hope that this verdict today will encourage victims of rape and other sexual offences to come forward and provide reassurance that their case will be thoroughly and professionally investigated; no matter how long it takes'
