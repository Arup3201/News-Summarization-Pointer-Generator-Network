After trying 55 players over 22 games, Roy Hodgson is set to gamble on youth when he names his England squad for the World Cup.

Sportsmail take a look at the 23 players set for a place on the Three Lions' plane to Brazil this summer.

GOALKEEPERS

Joe Hart

Age: 27 Club: Manchester City

Caps/Goals: 39/0

Tournaments: 2010 World Cup; Euro 2012

Verdict: Recovered from the early season downturn in form. Jolt of being dropped seems to have returned him to previous high standards and he has been crucial to City’s title bid.

Safe hands: Joe Hart will start in goal for England after recapturing his form for Manchester City

Ben Foster

Age: 31 Club: West Bromwich Albion

Caps/Goals: 6/0

Tournaments: None

Verdict: Roy Hodgson says that he does not chase retired England internationals — but he did so with Foster, wooing him back from exile to bolster his goalkeeping options. Foster made his debut in 200, retired from international football in 2011 but returned in February last year.

John Ruddy

Age: 27 Club: Norwich

Caps/goals: 1/0

Tournaments: None

Verdict: A choice between Ruddy and Celtic No1 Fraser Forster, 26, who also has only one cap. Both seen as good tourists but Ruddy edges it despite a difficult season for Norwich which ended in relegation even before today’s game with Arsenal. Selected for Euro 2012 but broke a fingerand missed out.

In reserve: Norwich's John Ruddy should just pip Celtic's Fraser Forster to a place on the plane

Glen Johnson

Age: 29 Club: Liverpool

Caps/goals: 50/1

Tournaments: 2010 World Cup; Euro 2012

Distance covered in 2013-14: 168.2 miles

Verdict: Much depends on him, with Spurs right-back Kyle Walker injured. Needs to provide speed and energy going forward as well as defensive solidity.

Gary Cahill

Age: 28 Club: Chelsea

Caps/goals: 22/2

Tournaments: None

Distance covered in 2013-14: 184.1 miles

Verdict: Hugely improved this season, he was outstanding in the Champions League. He now needs to transfer that form to the World Cup. Missed out on Euro 2012 after breaking his jaw.

In form: Gary Cahill has excelled for Chelsea this season and looks guaranteed to start in Brazil

Phil Jagielka

Age: 31 Club: Everton

Caps/goals: 24/1

Tournaments: Euro 2012

Distance covered in 2013-14: 144.8 miles

Verdict : Born in Manchester of Polish descent, Jagielka is solid at club level but the hamstring injury that blighted the second half of his season will be a concern. Opponents will feel England’s defence is vulnerable.

Luke Shaw

Age: 18 Club: Southampton

Caps/goals: 1/0

Tournaments: None

Distance covered in 2013-14: 205.9 miles

Verdict: The key decision for Hodgson — and he is veeringtowards the 18-year-old. Can even expect to play at times as England may want to rest Baines for a game.

On the plane? Phil Jagielka (left) and Luke Shaw (right) could both be on their way to Brazil

Leighton Baines

Age: 29 Club: Everton

Caps/goals: 22/1

Tournaments: Euro 2012

Distance covered in 2013-14: 191 miles

Verdict: Finally England’s first-choice left back, having edged out Ashley Cole. Left athome in 2010 — having been named in the provisional squad — because Fabio Capello wrongly thought he was too introspective and would be homesick away from family.

Phil Jones

Age: 22

Club: Manchester United

Caps/goals: 9/0

Tournaments: Euro 2012

Distance covered in 2013-14: 146.6 miles

Verdict: Will be selected, with John Stones ready to come in if the shoulder injury doesn’t respond totreatment quickly enough.

On the run: Leighton Baines is now England's No 1 left-back after ousting Ashley Cole

Chris Smalling

Age: 24

Club: Manchester United

Caps/goals: 10/0

Tournaments: None

Distance covered in 2013-14: 128.4 miles

Verdict: Not progressing as he should, his form has been marred by United’s poor season. But provides covers at centre-half and right-back. Made his debut against Bulgaria in September 2011.

Steven Gerrard

Age: 33

Club: Liverpool

Caps/goals: 109/21

Tournaments: Euro 2000, Euro 2004, 2006 World Cup, 2010 World Cup, Euro 2012

Distance covered in 2013-14: 203.9 miles

Verdict: A last tournament for the man who was an emerging star at Euro 2000. Reinvention as a holding midfielder has been hugely beneficial for England.

Captain fantastic: Steven Gerrard, now 33, will skipper the Three Lions in South America

Jordan Henderson

Age: 23 Club: Liverpool

Caps/goals: 8/0

Tournaments: Euro 2012

Distance covered in 2013-14: 230 miles

Verdict: Transformed this season, his energy and tactical discipline make him natural starting partner for Gerrard, replicating their club link up. Went to Euro 2012 after Lampard’s injury.

Jack Wilshere

Age: 22 Club: Arsenal

Caps/goals: 15/0

Previous tournaments: None

Distance covered in 2013-14: 126.7

Verdict: Once the jewel in the crown of England’s youngsters; now critiqued by Paul Scholes as a player not developing. Hodgson believes in him despite another season dogged by injury.

In favour: Roy Hodgson is a big fan of Jack Wilshere, despite the Arsenal man suffering an injury-plagued season

Ross Barkley

Age: 20

Club: Everton

Caps/goals: 3/0

Tournaments: None

Distance covered in 2013-14: 174.9 miles

Verdict: A stunning goal and all-round performance against Manchester City seems to have tipped the balance as Hodgson opts for youth and vitality.

Raheem Sterling

Age: 19

Club: Liverpool

Caps/goals: 2/0

Tournaments: None

Distance covered in 2013-14: 154.6 miles

Verdict: There are few surprises in World Cup football now but having only just broken through and never played in the Champions League, Sterling may shock a few opponents. Presumably not Liverpool team-mate Luis Suarez, though.

Form player: Raheem Sterling has enjoyed an outstanding campaign in Liverpool's dynamic midfield

Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain

Age: 20

Club: Arsenal

Caps/goals: 14/3

Tournaments: Euro 2012

Distance covered in 2013-14: 43.2 miles

Verdict: At his best a key player, shining in the Maracana last year. Can also play holding midfield. His current groin injury and the fact he has completed just three games this season count againsthim.

Adam Lallana

Age: 26

Club: Southampton

Caps/goals: 3/0

Tournaments: None

Distance covered in 2013-14: 249.9 miles

Verdict: Will start for England, representing an extraordinary rise in the past 18 months. Can be a key player either at wide left, wide right or behind the centre-forward. Likely to move to Liverpool.

Fresh blood: Southampton's Adam Lallana has impressed during his three caps for England

James Milner

Age: 28

Club: Manchester City

Caps/goals: 45/1

Tournaments: 2010 World Cup, Euro 2012

Distance covered in 2013-14: 117.8 miles

Verdict: Looked to be disappearing off the England radar but his key role in City’s title run-in sees him retained and increasingly likely to play a key role off the bench

Frank Lampard

Age: 35

Club: Chelsea

Caps: 103/29

Tournaments: Euro 2004, 2006 World Cup, 2010 World Cup

Distance covered in 2013-14: 130.6 miles

Verdict: Hodgson values him as a stable presence on and off the pitch. Plenty in the tank after an in-out season and will play at times to ease strain on Gerrard.

Still got it: Frank Lampard should be fresh after playing less games for Chelsea this season

Wayne Rooney

Age: 28 Club: Man United

Caps/goals: 89/38

Tournaments: Euro 2004, 2006 World Cup, 2010 World Cup, Euro 2012

Distance covered in 2013-14: 190.4 miles

Verdict: For once, there are no injury worries going into a major tournament. England are less dependent on him now but he remains a vital part of the team.

Rickie Lambert

Age: 32 Club: Southampton

Caps/goals: 4/2

Tournaments: None

Distance covered in 2013-14: 197 miles

Verdict: A popular member of the squad, at 32 he gets his reward for the journey through the backwaters of football. Has never missed a penalty, so look out for him warming up in readiness for a 119th minute substitution.

Rise: Rickie Lambert has gone from working in a factory to the brink of England's World Cup squad

Daniel Sturridge

Age: 24

Club: Liverpool

Cap/goals: 10/3

Tournaments: None

Distance covered in 2013-14: 142.1 miles

Verdict: One of the reasons for renewed optimism in England; a natural goalscorer with genuine pace who has flourished at Liverpool under Brendan Rodgers.

Danny Welbeck

Age: 23

Club: Manchester United

Caps/goals: 21/8

Tournaments: Euro 2012

Distance covered in 2013-14: 101.9 miles

Verdict: Distrusted by David Moyes but his ability to track back when wide left, as well as add speed and technical ability to counter attacks means he will play — and maybe even start against Italy.

Versatile: Hodgson is a fan of Danny Welbeck's ability to play out wide and through the middle
