They are known for their powerful paws and giant teeth, but not for their acting ability. Until now.

She said: 'We were out trying to take images of these amazing bears when one came along and just seemed to copy the sign on the side on the buggy.

'It was quite amazing.'

Churchill in Canada is the self-proclaimed 'Polar Bear Capital of the World'

Each winter the area is taken over nearly 1,000 bears making their way to Hudson Bay as it begins to freeze over, as they hunt the seals which make up their staple diet.

The annual bear trek to Hudson Bay provides a rare opportunity to see the animals up close and the area is a popular tourist destination.

If they stray into the area, they are shot and tranquilised before being lifted to a special polar bear 'jail' where they are held until they can be safely released again.
