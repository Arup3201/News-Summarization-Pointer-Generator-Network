Harry Redknapp has slammed England's stars saying 'half the players don't give a toss' after Roy Hodgson's side underwhelming 1-0 friendly win over Norway at Wembley.

The QPR boss said he understood why supporters stayed away after a crowd of only 40,181, the smallest number to attend an England match at Wembley since it was re-built in 2007, watched the game on Wednesday.

'Here we go again, a few months after a disastrous World Cup: yet another massive letdown for everyone,' said Redknapp in the Sun.

'It is disappointment after disappointment. Half the players don't give a toss. The fans can't be bothered to watch them.

'Managers of the Premier League clubs take an interest just to see if their players are going to come back injured from international duty.

'I don't blame the supporters for not being interested in England at the moment. Why should they be?

'We were told this is the start of a new era. Trust me, I hope so, I really do, but I'm not holding my breath because it will only get harder for England with the way things are in club football.

'And what possible value is there in a total non-event against the worst Norway team we have seen for years when the supporters are still sore from the World Cup shambles?'
