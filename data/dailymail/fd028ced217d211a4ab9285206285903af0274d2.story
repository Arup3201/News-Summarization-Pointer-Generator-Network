Highly-rated Everton youngster John Stones has revealed that one life-changing summer during his teen years prompted his mesmeric rise to the top after uncertainty whether he would even make the grade at former side Barnsley.

The 20-year-old has now gone on to establish himself as a first-team regular in the Premier League at Everton, but rewind five years earlier and the future looked all the more contrasting for Stones.

In an interview with The Times he said: 'I was actually held behind for two years. I played down, a year below my age group, when I was 14 or 15, playing with lads who were younger than me.

Stones had an uncertain future at Barnsley as a youngster before making the grade and then getting his big break at Premier League outfit Everton in January 2013

'That was tough, being told that, but I was small at the time. I think it was a kick up the bum, too, a reminder that you need to start producing  I suppose I dug in and it paid off.'

Ronnie Branson, academy manager at Barnsley, recently said 'he wasn't even the best player in the under 14 group' at the time, with Stones recollecting on the summer which changed everything.

He added: 'I think it was my size more than anything. I just shot up one summer. No one could believe it. My size changed and, with that, I think my mentality changed too. 

'It probably just clicked. I came back fitter, stronger and I could compete with lads my age.

'I just kicked on. I came back into my normal age group and then I quickly went up into the under-18s at 16, made my first-team debut at 17. That was probably a life-changer.' 

Stones went on to feature heavily in the Tykes' 2012/2013 campaign in particular, before making the move to Merseyside the next season for a reported fee of £3million.

The youngster's early stages of his Everton career haven't gone bad either, recently penning a five-year contract extension at the club. Next up for Stones is the challenge of keeping out Radamel Falcao and Co at Old Trafford on Sunday.
