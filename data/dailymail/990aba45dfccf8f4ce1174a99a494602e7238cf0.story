Southeast England is looking forward to the first summer evening of the year this Sunday, as high temperatures and a late sunset come together to create a rare golden afternoon.

Swathes of the South will be revelling in the sunshine all weekend, with temperatures soaring to 19C on Saturday and 20C on Sunday.

The mild weather is another dramatic shift as, even today, parts of the North and Southwest were buried under a layer of snow. This snowfall is expected to continue, particularly the Dartmoor area, tomorrow, but will be thawing by the start of the weekend.

Snow has been settling on Dartmoor just days before the start of British Summer Time should mark the shift in seasons

As well as the higher temperatures in the South, caused by warm air blowing in from the continent and moving up the country, this Sunday marks the beginning of British Summer Time (BST), meaning the clocks move forward by one hour.

As a result, sunset in the Southeast - which will enjoy the warmest evening - will not be until 7.31pm.

The high of 20C on Sunday is twice the average for this time of year and will see the mercury rise higher here than in Athens, Greece or Algiers, Algeria and match, degree for degree, the temperature in Tehran, Iran. It will be twice as hot in southeast England as in Ankara, Turkey.

Even hay fever sufferers will be able to enjoy the weather, with the pollen count peaking at a moderate level in central and southern England and remaining low across the rest of the country.

UV levels will also remain low, peaking in the southeast, at midday on Saturday, at just three out of six.

However, it won't be sunbathing weather for everyone as temperatures will be closer in the northern regions. The coldest area will be northern Scotland, particularly the Shetland Isles, where the Met Office predicts an optimistic high of 8C.

The sharp change in the weather is just another instance in a year of extremes for the British climate

While Dartmoor, pictured, is cold at the moment, it will have milder weather by Saturday. However, northern regions of the UK will be chilly throughout the weekend

A last shot of winter has hit parts of Britain with a flurry of snow before temperatures are set to rise at the weekend.

Parts of south west England received a dusting of white as well as higher ground on the Cumbrian and Northumberland border.

Wintry showers and hail storms have also been reported across the country.

Snow ploughs were seen clearing snow near Hartside Top Cafe, in Cumbria, which claims to be the highest cafe in England.

Paul Knightley, forecast manager at MeteoGroup, said: 'There's been a covering of snow over Dartmoor, some in places in Scotland and other parts of high ground.

'Over the next few hours a few more showers of snow will continue towards the south west of England and a little bit for the Pennines too.

Cumbria and Northumberland are two regions currently blanketed in snow, the North and Southwest will get more cold weather before it improves on the weekend

Temperatures this week have been average or just below for this time of year but this weekend will soar to twice what would be normally expected

The weather in Nenthead, on the Cumbria and Northumberland border, has been snowy and will get further light showers today and tomorrow

'As we get towards the weekend there will be a change in the wind which will pull warm air from the continent and temperatures in London might get up to the 19 or 20 degrees.'

'Some areas will enjoy the warmer weather but there also will be exceptions. Further to the east and above the Humber area there be will a south east wind which will be chilly.'

However, for the rest of the country, the reappearance of the sun means the chill will begin to melt away.

Dan Williams from the Met Office 
said: 'It is looking mainly dry, with a fair bit of cloud, but some 
brighter spells in the far west, so parts of west Wales and southwestern
 England on both Saturday and Sunday.

'After seeing a some slightly normal temperatures for this time of year - perhaps slightly cooler during this week - as of Saturday we should see temperatures get a bit of a bump up.

'We could see 19 or 20 maybe, perhaps
 in the southeast of England, as we see warmer weather move up from the 
continent, bringing slightly warmer temperatures than we have seen 
recently.

'The average maximum temperature for this time of year 
is about 10 degrees in England. But while temperatures will be a above 
average, it is not unusual to see them rise above average.'

However,
 as the clocks go forward an hour on Sunday and we all lose some sleep, 
the prospect of summer is not something all Britons can look forward to.

Mr Williams warned that 
northeastern and eastern parts of the UK will still feel the chill that 
gripped much of the nation this week.

He said: 'It will continue to feel fairly chilly and it will be colder in the northeast with some showers expected on Sunday.'

However, he added that come Monday, most of the country will see temperatures in their mid-teens, despite the risk of some more rain.

Scientists have discovered a shift in the seasons, with spring arriving early and autumn being delayed.

Peter
 Atkinson, professor of geography at the University of Southampton, has 
examined satellite images of vegetation across the northern hemisphere 
from the past 25 years and found signs that winter is becoming shorter.

Earlier
 this month, supermarkets Waitrose and Tesco both announced that English 
strawberries were ripening early and hitting the shelves a week earlier 
than last year.

Professor
 Atkinson said: 'There is much speculation about whether our seasons are
 changing and if so, whether this is linked to climate change. Our study
 is another significant piece in the puzzle, which may ultimately answer
 this question.'

The
 researchers examined a range of vegetation types with forests which 
have not been affected by human intervention acting as the best 
signifier for the changing seasons.

The
 most pronounced change found by the researchers was in the broad-leaved
 deciduous and needle-leaved deciduous forest groups, showing that 
autumn is becoming significantly later with an early onset of spring.

Professor
 Atkinson said: 'Previous studies have reported trends in the start of 
spring and end of autumn, but we have studied a longer time period and 
controlled for forest loss and vegetation type, making our study more 
rigorous and with a greater degree of accuracy.

'Our
 research shows that even when we control for land cover changes across 
the globe, a changing climate is significantly altering the vegetation 
growth cycles for certain types of vegetation. Such changes may have 
consequences for the sustainability of the plants themselves, as well as
 species which depend on them, and ultimately the climate through 
changes to the carbon cycle.'

The
 project, which involved scientists from the Department of Remote 
Sensing at the Birla Institute of Technology in India, is published in 
the journal Remote Sensing of the Environment.
