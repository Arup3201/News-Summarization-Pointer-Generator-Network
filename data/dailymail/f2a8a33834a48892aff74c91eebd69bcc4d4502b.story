Complaint: Aides of Prince Harry (pictured here serving in Afghanistan) have said pursuing the complaint would be a 'distraction' from his work as an Apache helicopter co-pilot

Prince Harry has decided not to make a formal complaint to the press watchdog over the Sun’s decision to publish nude photographs of him.

The tabloid was the only newspaper to defy advice from the Press Complaints Commission not to print the pictures of Harry taken during a game of strip billiards in Las Vegas.

The PCC received 3,600 complaints from the public about the photos which showed Harry – along with two naked girls – in his £5,100-a-night suite at the Encore Wynn Hotel last month.

Harry, an Apache helicopter co-pilot gunner, has now deployed to Afghanistan.

A St James’s Palace spokesman said: ‘Prince Harry is currently focused entirely on his deployment in Afghanistan, so to pursue a complaint relating to his private life would not be appropriate at this time and would prove to be a distraction.

'We have concluded that it would not be prudent to pursue the matter further.’

The PCC, which had warned that publication could breach the editors’ code of practice on  privacy grounds, has already said it would be ‘inappropriate’ to open its own investigation into the Sun’s printing of the photos.

The Sun defended its decision to publish, claiming ‘Harry has compromised his own privacy’ and pointing out that the photos were on the internet.

He had been photographed while on a short break in Las Vegas just a few weeks before he was sent back to Afghanistan.

The Sun’s front-page image showed Harry holding his genitals and another inside showed him with his bottom exposed while apparently playing strip billiards with an unknown blonde.

The editorial said it was 'vital; that the paper ran the pictures: 'It is absurd that in the internet age newspapers like The Sun could be stopped from publishing stories and pictures already seen by millions on the free-for-all that is the web.'

The decision by St James’s Palace not to
pursue a complaint with the PCC comes a few weeks after the press 
watchdog said it would be 'inappropriate' to open its own investigation 
into the Sun’s printing of the nude photos.

The PCC received around 3,800 complaints from the public about the newspaper’s publication of the pictures.

In a statement, the PCC it 'did not consider that it would be appropriate to open an investigation into this matter in the absence of a formal complaint to the Commission from Prince Harry'.

It will consider the matter further at its next regular meeting.

Legal action: The Palace has decided to sue the French magazine Closer after it published topless pictures of the Duchess of Cornwall (pictured)

The move follows the Royals' decision to sue French magazine Closer after it was the first to publish the snaps of the Duchess of Cambridge 
sunbathing at a chateau in southern France.

Police probing the photographer who took the pictures have questioned staff at the chateau where the couple were staying.

Closer published 13 grainy images of 
Kate's breasts and bottom last Thursday, branded 'grotesque and 
unjustifiable' by a Royal spokesman.

Danish
celebrity magazine Se og Hoer was the fifth publication to print 
photographs of Kate sunbathing topless as the images have now been seen 
by millions worldwide.
