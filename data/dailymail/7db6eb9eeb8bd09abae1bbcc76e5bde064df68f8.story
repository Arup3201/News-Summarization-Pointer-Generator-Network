A frail grandfather was beaten up in his own home by two self-styled vigilantes who wrongly suspected him of being involved with the theft of their Christmas presents.

Christopher O'Brien, 36, and his 
26-year-old nephew John Bonner, boasted after the brutal assault on Norman Sheldon who died six days later.

Despite protesting that he knew nothing about the disappearance of the gifts from Bonner's house, O'Brien repeatedly punched the 47-year-old grandfather in the face, causing him to hit his head against a wall.

Later the victim who suffered from a pre-existing illness began to complain of headaches and the following morning was found collapsed in his home by his partner who phoned an ambulance.

Mr Sheldon described as a 'proud family man with a big heart and a loyal friend to all that knew him,' was taken to hospital but he died five days later from his injuries.

At Manchester Crown Court, O'Brien, of Gorton, admitted manslaughter and was jailed for nine and a half years. Bonner, of Openshaw, pleaded guilty to affray and was jailed for 16 months.

The tragedy occurred in November last year after Bonner came home from a night out to find his house had been looted of Christmas presents.

He was led to believe a local man known as 'Irish Tony' was involved in the raid and he recruited his uncle to help him with his man hunt.

Their search took them to Mr Sheldon's home in Openshaw where Bonner confronted Mr Sheldon on the doorstep demanding that he tell him if the man responsible for the burglary was at the house.

But when Mr Sheldon told him he did not know where he was, a balaclava-clad O'Brien ran inside and began to punch the victim repeatedly about the face causing him to fall against the wall and bang his head. Both Bonner and O'Brien then fled.

The following day on November 19, police were called to the house and found Mr Sheldon unconscious. He was taken to hospital for treatment to serious head injuries and but died on November 24.

Police initially treated the incident as murder. But in mitigation O'Brien's lawyer Nicola Gatto said her client was 'horrified' at Mr Sheldon's death.

He thought the victim would be merely 'battered and bruised'.

Sentencing, Judge Michael Henshell told him: 'You and your nephew were taking the law into your own hands that day. The courts will not tolerate that kind of behaviour - it's almost akin to a lynch mob.

'His injuries were no doubt made worse because of his frail condition. Mr Sheldon merely opened the door to you - his reward was that he was beaten by you, as a result he died. In the immediate aftermath you were boasting.'

Today, Mr Sheldon's daughter Gemma said in her statement on behalf of herself and brother Jamie: 'Since the guilty pleas my brother and I have both started to accept that our dad is not coming back.

'I am satisfied that they have accepted their guilt and admitted to their actions - but I still feel very angry and sick in the pit of my stomach that somebody could do that to another person.

'I want to move on now. I want to build a life for my family, my son and partner who has supported me throughout.'

Detectove Inspector Andy Cunliffe, from Greater Manchester Police, said: 'Bonner and O'Brien decided to take the law into their own hands and in doing so a doting father, grandfather, brother and uncle needlessly lost his life.

'The law cannot tolerate persons who take matters into their own hands and the sentences that they have been given clearly reflects this.

'The family have shown great dignity during this investigation and can now start to rebuild their lives.'
