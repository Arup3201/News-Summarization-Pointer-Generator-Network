A maze of symmetrical steps appear to form a never ending path deep underground.

The incredible sight is in fact a man-made step well in Abhaneri, India, made up of 3,500 narrow steps that allow people to fetch water all year round.

It descends around 100ft into the ground, making it one of the deepest and largest of its kind in the world.

Around 3,500 steps line the edges of the well, descending in a maze-like formation all the way to the bottom

Despite the open architecture of the well temperatures at the bottom of the well are consistently five to six degrees below the temperatures on the surface

The Abhaneri step well, in Rajasthan, India, is lined by a maze of symmetrical steps appearing to form a never ending path deep underground

Known as Chand Baori to locals, the well is 1,200 years old

The well descends around 100ft into the ground, making it one of the deepest and largest step wells in the world

During the monsoon season the well has been known to fill up almost to the top, however water collects from the edges and the earth underground all year round

So deep is the well - known as Chand Baori to locals - temperatures at the bottom can be as much as five to six degrees cooler than on the surface.

And during the monsoon season the well rapidly fills up, although no longer to the top.

Photographer Florian Wizorek, 34, from Berlin, Germany, captured the mind-bending sight during a trip to India.Â 

Hindu designs decorate the ancient walls of the well giving the site a spiritual significance

A closer look at the well's design reveals picture stories of ancient Hindu mythology

He said: 'Due to being surrounded by dozens of stairs, people can access the well from literally every side and when having a closer look at its structures and design, you will easily and yourself not only stuck in a maze of thousands steps but also able to see Shivas beauty.'

Classic Hindu architecture dominates the 1200-year-old well, which is a class one monument in India, the same as the famous Taj Mahal.

Florian added: 'The wells sheer endlessly appearing geometric complexity made of stairs and steps ensures that Rajput people have access to water at any time of the year.

'Despite its open architecture the well has its own microclimate as at the bottom its always about 5-6 degrees cooler than on earth level and in the sun.'

The well is made of dark porous volcanic stones meaning water seeps through from the sides and bottom, as well as rain water from above.
