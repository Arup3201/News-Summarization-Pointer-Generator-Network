The stepbrother of a severely malnourished teen found walking barefoot in the cold near her home wearing pyjamas was today charged with repeatedly sexually assaulting her from her 10th birthday.

The 18-year-old man allegedly began the assaults on the 15-year-old girl in the same year she claims her father and stepmother began confining her to the basement of her home in Wisconsin.

The girl's father, 40, and stepmother, 42, were charged with child abuse, reckless endangerment and neglecting a child. All three accused appeared in a Wisconsin court on Thursday for a hearing.

The stepbrother sexually assaulted 
the girl in December 2006, the month she turned 10, and again from 
February 2009 to February 2010, prosecutors say. He was charged with 
child sexual assault.

Robert Burke, defending, said the 
parents have strong ties to the community. Bail was set by the court at 
$22,500 for the father, $30,000 for the stepmother and $25,000 for the 
girl's stepbrother.

Meanwhile astonishing details emerged
of how child protection services has dealt with eight reports of 
abuse against the malnourished teenage girl found walking the streets 
barefoot.

It comes as the girl’s neighbours 
revealed today that she rarely left her home in Wisconsin - but when she
did emerge, she would scavenge through rubbish bins and eat discarded 
scraps.

The 15-year-old - allegedly forced to stay in a basement for six years and eat her own faeces - was found walking in Wisconsin last Monday, with purple bare feet and a bleeding face.

In only one of the eight reports - 
from when the girl was aged just months old in 1997 - maltreatment was 
'substantiated’, according to State Department of Children & 
Families records sent to MailOnline.

But in three reports, ‘maltreatment
was 'unsubstantiated’ - and three others were ‘screened out’ by officials.
Two of those saw health services officials ‘refer the family to a 
community service provider’.

The eighth report was filed last Monday when the girl was found walking in the streets of Wisconsin.

'A report is screened out if the agency determines that the reported information or allegation does not meet the legal definition of abuse or neglect,' a State Department of Children & Families spokesman told MailOnline.

She added that the opposite is when 'a report of alleged maltreatment that meets the legal definition of abuse or neglect has been received by the agency and has been screened in for investigation and assessment of the family'.

Neighbour Mark Stuntebeck said he called 
child protection in the last two years after he saw her taking 
out the rubbish and scavenging through it, but doesn't know if anyone 
ever followed up.

‘She seemed to be hiding and munching 
on crumbs or remnants of something,’ said Mr Stuntebeck, 44, who lives 
next door. But he wasn’t the only neighbour to think there was something
wrong.

In court: The girl told police she was let out of the basement to 'clean some papers' for her mother, who became angry because she wasn't doing it fast enough and threatened to throw her down the stairs

Melissa Clark, 38, said the girl 
rarely came outside but she could hear her family berating her inside 
the house. Ms Clark's mother, who was visiting last year, noticed the 
girl and called child protection.

She doesn't know if anything was done.
The girl’s parents once yelled at her for showing too much skin when 
she was bent over and her blouse hung off her, Ms Clark, who lives 
across the street, said.

Investigation: The stepbrother was also arrested by local police for an alleged probation violation

‘It was horrible,’ she said. ‘She was 
treated like Cinderella.’

A police spokesman said on Wednesday 
that the teen, who weighed 70lbs when she was found, was getting medical
treatment and is being held in protective custody.

The malnourished girl told authorities
she had been forced to stay in the unfinished basement of her father 
and stepmother's home since 2006 and that an alarm would sound if she 
went upstairs.

She allegedly ate what she could find 
in the rubbish and had to eat her own faeces and drink her urine - but 
if she was caught eating without permission, she had to throw it out or 
vomit it back up.

The allegations came to light after 
Mike Vega, 31, saw the girl walking in thin pyjamas, barefoot and crying
on a cold afternoon last Monday. ‘It was the most shocking thing I have
ever seen,’ he said.

She was bleeding from a gash on her 
nose and other small scrapes and was so scrawny Mr Vega mistook her for 
an 8-year-old. He called police. ‘I've never seen anybody look like 
that,’ he said.

A doctor quoted in police reports said
what the girl went through before she was found by Mr Vega - who lives 
about a mile from the teen and her family - amounted to ‘torture.’

Shocked: Mike Vega points to the pavement in Wisconsin, where he discovered the 15-year-old girl

Mr Vega was driving on a busy street 
when he saw her. As he slowly passed her, he looked through his 
rear-view mirror and saw her bare feet. He backed up, and she told him 
she needed help.

'It was the most shocking thing I have ever seen. I've never seen anybody look like that'

Mike Vega, 31, who found girl on street

Once inside his car, she was scared at
first, but Mr Vega said she became more comfortable after he showed her
photos of his three young sons and a Mary Poppins video on his mobile 
phone.

According to police records, the girl 
claimed she was let out of the basement that day to ‘clean some papers’ 
for her stepmother, who had become angry because she wasn't working fast
enough.

The teen told Mr Vega the stepmother 
threw her back downstairs but she managed to escape out a window. Mr 
Vega said she told him she feared the woman would throw her down the 
stairs again.

She said she had threatened to 
kill her. Mr Vega said the girl ‘wasn't crying, wasn't hysterical’. ‘But
it wasn't nonchalant either,’ he added. ‘You could see fear in her eyes.
It was very disturbing.’

Barbara Knox, a physician quoted in 
the police reports, told officers the malnutrition the girl suffered 
‘poses a significant risk of death’ and that chronic starvation had 
caused her puberty to be arrested.

The physician at the American Family 
Children's Hospital in Wisconsin also said that the girl would
be at high risk for other disorders and complications that can lead to 
death.

The teen said her stepmother 
home-schooled her using a third-grade workbook, according to the 
affidavit. Two other minors in the home were 
taken into protective custody, police said.

Police did encounter the girl in 2007,
when someone alleged she might have been molested by a relative. The 
girl did not corroborate the allegation and her family was not 
cooperative, police said.

She appeared healthy at the time, 
police said. The girl's father allegedly gave medical reasons for her 
condition last week - but a hospital social worker told police there was
likely much more to it.

Her stepmother has owned the Wisconsin home since 2005 and reportedly bought it from Christian affordable 
housing organisation Habitat for Humanity, who performed a background 
check of her.
