A triple child killer who impaled his victims on spiked garden railings had his cloak of anonymity lifted yesterday in a major victory for ‘open justice’.

David McGreavy – dubbed the Monster of Worcester – had used human rights law to claim the public should be kept in the dark about his bid to move to an open jail.

But, after a legal challenge by the Daily Mail and other newspapers, the High Court quashed the secrecy order.

It removes the chilling prospect of the public not knowing if one of the most dangerous men in Britain is close to being released.

Last night, Dorothy Urry, the mother of his three victims, called for criminals to be banned from exploiting the Human Rights Act and said it was vital that Press freedom to report the workings of the criminal justice system be protected.

Her plea came as police seek to impose draconian restrictions on the identification of suspects.

‘Why shouldn’t criminals be named,’ asked Mrs Urry. ‘We don’t know who we’re walking next to these days – the public has a right to know.

'If he was to move next door, you would have to know exactly who and what he was. It may stop people doing what he did if they knew how it ruined lives.”

McGreavy, now 62, committed one of the most horrific crimes of the past 40 years when, on Friday April 13, 1973, he murdered the three children of Mrs Urry – who was then known as Elsie Ralph – and her husband Clive.

He was a lodger with the couple and had been babysitting at their Worcester home when the youngest child, nine-month-old Samantha, began crying for her bottle.

McGreavy went berserk, battering Samantha to death. Her brother Paul, four, was strangled and Dawn, two, had her throat cut. Police found their mutilated bodies impaled on a neighbour’s railings.

He was jailed for life, with a minimum term of 20 years. Since this term expired, he has been trying to secure his freedom but has yet to be released by the Parole Board.

The triple killing has continued to shock the UK for the last 40 years

A key step on the road to freedom is 
moving to an open jail. McGreavy has previously spent two years in an 
open prison, where he was allowed out on day release, but was returned 
to a closed prison at an undisclosed location.

Earlier this year, McGreavy launched a
legal challenge against the Parole Board’s latest refusal of his bid to
move to an open jail.

In an extraordinary ruling, the judge
agreed to a request by his lawyers that his identity should be kept 
secret throughout the proceedings.

They used the Human Rights Act to claim that – if inmates found out what he had done – he could be attacked.

The Mail and other newspaper groups –
backed by Justice Secretary Chris Grayling – immediately challenged the
ruling to defend the principle of open justice.

Challenging the anonymity order at a 
hearing last month, Guy Vassall-Adams, appearing for Mr Grayling and the
Press, said of McGreavy’s crimes: ‘The full facts are exceptionally 
horrific by even the standard of murders.’

The gagging order restricted the 
media to saying they were ‘three sadistic murders – but that doesn’t 
even give you the half of it’, said Mr Vassall-Adams.

Yesterday, Lord Justice Pitchford, 
sitting with Lord Justice Simon, said: ‘In our judgment, there is at 
present no real and immediate risk to the claimant’s life and safety 
because he is serving his sentence in conditions in which his safety can
be closely monitored.’

McGreavy’s next parole review – his 
ninth – is under way, with a target date of August 1 for a hearing, 
although Lord Justice Pitchford said it was ‘doubtful’ that date would 
be met. If it was, and it was recommended he be returned to open 
conditions, that could occur in October, said the judge.

If he did go back to open conditions,
the review would have to consider steps that could be taken to protect 
McGreavy, which ‘might include a change of name’.

Mr Grayling said: ‘I welcome the court’s decision. This is a clear victory for open justice.’

The only reason that McGreavy has ever given for the killing is that Samantha Ralph was crying for her bottle

Lawyers for the Monster of Worcester used four sections of the Human Rights Act to try to keep his identity secret.

These were article 2 (the right to life); article 3 (the right to protection from ill-treatment); article 5 (the right to liberty and security) and article 8 (the right to privacy and a family life).

Most weight was placed on articles 2 and 3, with Quincy Whitaker, McGreavy’s lawyer, insisting that there was ‘a serious likelihood of a serious attack’ if fellow prison inmates learned of his identity through the media.

But Lord Justice Pitchford said McGreavy – who is in a vulnerable prisoner unit – could have his safety ‘closely monitored’ in jail.

Dorothy Urry, the mother of his victims, said: ‘He doesn’t deserve human rights, he’s not even human. He committed such a horrendous crime and should have to face up to it.

‘What about my human right to live my life without looking over my shoulder because the killer of my children is roaming free? What about the human rights of my children?’

They were, in the words of High Court judge Mr Justice Simon, ‘exceptionally horrific crimes’.Three children were murdered, apparently for no other reason than to silence the crying of a nine-month-old baby.

Then, their small bodies broken, they were impaled on garden railings in an act of grotesque savagery that shocked the nation.

The date was Friday, April 13, 1973. Dorothy Urry, then known as Elsie Ralph, was 23 and working as a barmaid in Worcester.

Her husband Clive Ralph had gone to collect her from work and had left their children in the care of David McGreavy, a family friend and lodger.

The children knew him well, and had played with him happily in the past. The couple thought they had no reason to worry about the welfare of their children.

Yet, when they returned to their home in Gillam Street, Worcester, they discovered that the police were waiting for them. An officer escorted to them to the local police station and broke the news: Paul, four, Dawn, two, and baby Samantha were all dead.

The couple were told McGreavy had admitted killing them, but that police were still looking for their bodies. Later that night, they were found in a row, impaled on a neighbour’s spiked garden railings.

McGreavy, 21, who had been kicked out of the Royal Navy, reportedly told police that Samantha had wanted her bottle and wouldn’t stop crying.

‘I put my hand over her mouth and it went from there,’ he said. ‘It’s all in the house. On Paul I used a wire. I was going to bury [Paul] but I couldn’t… I went outside and put them on the fence. All I can hear is kids, kids, kids.’

Paul was strangled, Dawn had had her throat cut and Samantha died from a compound fracture to the skull.

It remains unclear if there was more to the killings and prison psychologists who interviewed McGreavy explored the possibility that there may have been a ‘sexual motive’.

Mrs Urry, who took an overdose six months after losing her children, and has since moved to Andover in Hampshire, said she had lived through ‘40 years of hell’.

‘If he was released, I’d be waiting outside with a gun,’ she said yesterday. ‘Life should mean life and he should never get to walk free. He got off lightly with a life sentence – he should have been hanged.

‘I think about what he did every minute of every day because he took my life away. I can’t go to family parties any more, I can’t celebrate anything.

Put yourself in my shoes, how would you feel?

‘I can’t and will never move on. For what he did to my three children and me, he deserves the same treatment that they got – death.’
