Unexplained death: William Rudloff, 13, shot himself in the head in Sloatsburg, New York on August 2

A teenage altar boy committed suicide by shooting himself in the head on a quiet village street. 

Hundreds attended the funeral of 13-year-old William Rudloff on Monday.

His distraught mother asked the congregation to focus on how her son had lived and not on his death.

Police have closed the investigation into the teenager's death on August 2 which left his small community reeling.

William walked out into the street, close to his home in Sloatsburg, New York and fired a gun at his head.

He died two days later in Westchester Medical Center, Valhalla.

Officials said there was no criminal wrongdoing, calling the death a 'tragedy'.

In the two weeks since his death, there has been little information released. It was not known how the 13-year-old got hold of a gun or who it belonged to.

William was honored at St Joan of Arc Church as a generous child who gave his birthday money to charity.

His mother Gaetana Maiano said: 'William was our rock, our pillar of strength. He loved and cared for everyone.'

William's father Mark, who is separated from his mother, was also at the service along with his younger siblings Alison and Andrew and extended family. 

The teenager was buried at Ascension Cemetery in Airmont. The family asked that donations be made in William's name to his church or St Jude Children's Research Hospital. 

The shooting earlier this month was witnessed by 20-year-old Victor Sanchez Jr who told lohud.com that he was 50 feet away when he saw the boy raise the gun to his head and fall to the ground.

Mr Sanchez ran into Sterlington Station deli nearby to dial 911.

Worries: Revered Dias, who trained William as an altar boy, said he had stopped attending church last year because he was having family problems

The death of the Suffern
Middle School student has left the small community in shock as they 
believed the young man to be a popular athlete with plenty of friends.

Reverend D. Francis Dias, of St Joan of Arc Church, told Journal News last week that he had trained William as an altar boy for five years.

The priest said that the teenager had stopped coming to church last year because he was experiencing family problems.
