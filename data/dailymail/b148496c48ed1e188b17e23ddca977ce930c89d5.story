Fishermen can be very protective over their favourite spot  as these brown bears showed when they got into a fight over salmon.

These images were taken by 15-year-old schoolgirl Elizaveta Tischenko as she watched the animals attempting to catch their dinner in Katmai National Park, in southern Alaska.

Elizaveta said one bear was catching a steady stream of fish when the other grew jealous after hardly catching any and tried to muscle his way in.

While the newcomer was tolerated for a while, eventually he began to treat on the claws of the other bear, which is when the fighting started. 

Elizaveta, who was watching from a grassy verge said: 'I had been watching the bear fish from a safe distance when I noticed another bear wander in.

'The first bear was not happy about the other bear being there and began to get more agitated as it began to try to catch fish in the water.

'It wasn't long before the two approached one another and began roaring ferociously to try and scare each other away. Neither one would back down for quite a while and they began to grapple with each other in the water.

'Eventually, the new bear on the scene decided to cut its loses and sulked off out of sight. When they are fishing they look quite cute and innocent but when they fight you get to see the true nature of the animals.'

Anger: The two brown bears were snapped fighting over a fishing spot while trying to catch dinner in Katmai National Park, Alaska

Squaring up: Tussle broke out as one bear was catching a steady stream of fish, causing the other to get jealous and try to muscle in

Vicious! The two bears raked each other with their claws during the fight before the newcomer was seen off

Snapped: Schoolgirl Elizaveta Tischenko, 15, captured these images while watching from a grassy bank opposite the river

More bark than bite: Elizaveta said that while the bears made a lot of noise, neither of them was seriously hurt during the fight

Sightseeing: Thousands of bears live inside the nature reserve, feasting on the shoals of salmon that migrate up its rivers

Don't be fooled: Elizaveta said that the bears looked cuddly and innocent while they were fishing, but that quickly changed

Finish him: It didn't take long for the first bear to see off the challenger, after which he went back to catching his dinner

To the victor, the spoils: The brown bear continued catching salmon after seeing off the challenge of his rival

Skilled: Elizaveta Tishcenko, 15, captured these stunning images with a long lens while standing on a nearby grassy bank
