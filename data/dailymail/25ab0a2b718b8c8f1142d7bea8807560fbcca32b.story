These pictures show the scorched remains of priceless historical documents torched by Islamist fighters before they fled French troops as they closed in on Timbuktu.

The extremists set fire to a library containing thousands of priceless historic manuscripts as they fled French and Malian forces.

Without firing a shot, 1,000 French soldiers backed by 200 Malian troops descended on the ancient desert trading post, as they tried to cut off the escape of al Qaeda-linked fighters.

But before they could be rounded up, the rebels scattered into the desert, torching homes, mosques and libraries, including parts of the city's £16-million Ahmed Baba Institute, home to some 20,000 ancient documents on culture, science and geography, as they left.

French President Francois Hollande visited the Djingarei-ber Mosque and the Ahmed Baba Institute, yesterday.

He said it was essential that Timbuktu, a UNESCO World Heritage site, should be properly protected so that it could 'shine' as a cultural treasure for the world.

Built by the South African government in 2009, the Ahmed Baba Institute was named after a 
Timbuktu-born contemporary of William Shakespeare and holds thousands of priceless manuscripts in its climate-controlled, underground vaults.

During their rule, the militants have systematically destroyed UNESCO World Heritage sites in Timbuktu.

A spokesman for the Al Qaeda-linked 
militants has said that ancient tombs of Sufi saints were destroyed 
because they contravened Islam, encouraging Muslims to venerate saints 
instead of God.

Among the tombs they destroyed is that of Sidi Mahmoudou, a saint who died in 955, according to the UNESCO website.

 have succeeded in removing some of the manuscripts from Timbuktu to 
save them, while others have been carefully hidden away from the 
Islamists.

With its cultural treasures, Timbuktu had previously been a destination for adventurous tourists and international scholars.

Extreme Islamist movements across the world have developed a reputation 
for the destruction of historic artifacts, monuments and buildings, such as the Bamiyan buddha statues in Afghanistan.

Speaking by phone earlier this week, city mayor Ousmane Halle said: 'They torched all the important ancient 
manuscripts. The ancient books of geography and science. It is the 
history of Timbuktu, of its people.'

Battle ready: Malian soldiers arrive at Gao airport, north of Mali as they joined French forces in a push toward the fabled desert town of Timbuktu

Tough job: But despite facing little of no resistance so far, French and Malian troops face a tough job of combing through the labyrinth of ancient mosques, monuments and mud-brick homes between alleys to flush out any hiding Islamist fighters

Ground forces backed by French 
paratroopers and helicopters took control of Timbuktu's airport and 
roads leading to the desert town in an overnight operation.

The institute moved to a new, state-of-the-art home in the centre of Timbuktu in 2009, built by the South African government at a cost of £16.5 million.

Its
 underground, climate-controlled storage rooms were home to some 30,000 
priceless manuscripts documenting centuries of African culture, science,
 geography and more.

Most
 of the manuscripts are in Arabic script, but contain many local 
languages, and provide unique insights into Timbuktu's emergence as a 
trading post, and by the 1500s as a famous university town, full of 
students and scribes.

But despite facing little of no 
resistance so far, they face a tough job of combing through the 
labyrinth of ancient mosques and monuments and mud-brick homes between 
alleys to flush out any hiding Islamist fighters.

'We have to be extremely careful. But
 in general terms, the necessary elements are in place to take control,'
 French army spokesman Lieutenant Thierry Burkhard said in Paris.

Timbuktu member of parliament El Hadj Baba Haïdara told Reuters in Bamako the Islamist rebels had abandoned the city.

'They all fled. Before their departure they destroyed some buildings, including private homes,' he said.

The move marked the latest inroad by 
the two-week-old French mission to oust radical Islamists from the 
northern half of Mali, which they seized more than nine months ago.

The
 RAF has already provided two heavy-lift C17 transport planes and a 
Sentinel surveillance aircraft to assist France's operation, and 
National Security Adviser Sir Kim Darroch was today in Paris to discuss 
what further help may be offered.

Mr
 Cameron has said the UK is ready to offer logistical, intelligence and 
surveillance help to France, as well as troops for a proposed EU mission
 to train the Malian army - although he has ruled out a combat role for 
British personnel.

During its Golden Age, Timbuktu was a 
haven of wealth, business and culture to which travelers from all 
corners of the world would travel to trade their wares.

Founded by nomads in the twelfth century, it was named the City of 333 Saints and soon became a centre for spreading Islamic culture throughout Africa.

As more people settled, it became one of the world's busiest trading posts specialising in salt, gold, ivory and slaves.

It was enveloped by the Mali Empire early in the 14th century, ruled by the fearsome warlord Mansa Musa I.

With Mansa its ruler and Timbuktu at its heart, Mali became the richest empire in the world, known as The African El Dorado and a city made of gold.

As the centuries 
drew on, Timbuktu became a center of Islamic study and the home of 
Sankore Madrasah university and extensive libraries.

They contain thousands of priceless manuscripts recording 
genealogies and scientific theories, as well as intellectual arguments 
between scholars, teachers and commentators.

The world was shocked by its capture 
on April 1 by Tuareg desert fighters whose separatist rebellion was 
later hijacked by Islamist radicals who imposed severe sharia law.

Provoking international outrage, the 
Islamist militants who follow a more conservative Salafist branch of 
Islam destroyed dozens of ancient shrines in Timbuktu sacred to moderate
 Sufi Moslems, condemning them as idolatrous and un-Islamic.

They also applied amputations for thieves and stoning of adulterers under sharia, while forcing women to go veiled.

Many women among the 
thousands of Gao residents who came out to celebrate the rebels' 
expulsion made a point of going unveiled.

Other residents smoked 
cigarettes and played music to flout the bans previously set by the 
Islamist rebels.

The
 French and Malian forces so far have met little resistance from the 
Islamists, who seized northern Mali in the wake of a military coup in 
the distant capital of Bamako, in southern Mali.

'Little by little, Mali is being liberated,' French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius told France 2 television.

At Gao, more than 300 km (190 miles) 
east of Timbuktu, jubilant residents danced to music in the streets on 
Sunday to celebrate the liberation of this other ancient Niger River 
town from the sharia-observing rebels.

A third northern town, the Tuareg seat
 of Kidal, in Mali's rugged and remote northeast, remains in the hands 
of the Islamist fighters, a loose alliance that groups AQIM with Malian 
Islamist group Ansar Dine and AQIM splinter MUJWA.
