For the second time this month a member of the armed forces assigned to help prevent sexual assaults in the military is under investigation for alleged sexual misconduct.

The back-to-back Army and Air Force cases highlight a problem that is drawing increased scrutiny in Congress and expressions of frustration from Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel. Lawmakers said it was time for Hagel to get tough with the military brass.

‘This is sickening. Twice now, in a 
matter of as many weeks, we've seen the very people charged with 
protecting victims of sexual assault being charged as perpetrators,’ 
Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., said.

‘It's an astonishing reminder that 
the Pentagon has both a major problem on its hands and a tremendous 
amount of work to do to assure victims - who already only report a small
 fraction of sexual assaults - that they are changing the culture around
 these heinous crimes.

'Secretary Hagel needs to act swiftly
 to re-examine sexual assault services across the department to ensure 
that these disturbing betrayals of trust are ended,' Murray said.

A soldier assigned to coordinate a sexual assault prevention program in Texas is under investigation for 'abusive sexual contact' and has been suspended from his duties, the Army announced Tuesday.

The solider is being investigated for among other things forcing a subordinate into prostitution and sexually assaulting two others, according to a Capitol Hill staffer who has been briefed on the case and spoke about it on condition of anonymity, reports KSDK.com.

Furious: U.S. Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel, seen on Tuesday, is said to have reacted angry and disappointed by the latest allegations brought to his attention

The Army said a sergeant first class, 
whose name was not released, is being 
investigated by the Army Criminal Investigation Command. No charges have
 been filed.

The investigation comes just one week 
after an Air Force officer who headed a sexual assault prevention office
 was himself arrested on charges of groping a woman in a parking lot.

The back-to-back Army and Air Force 
cases highlight a problem that is drawing increased scrutiny in Congress
 and expressions of frustration from top Pentagon leaders.

Pentagon press secretary George 
Little said after Tuesday’s announcement that Defense Secretary Chuck 
Hagel is angry and disappointed at 'these troubling allegations and the 
breakdown in discipline and standards they imply.'

Little said Hagel met with Army 
Secretary John McHugh earlier on Tuesday and ordered him to 'fully 
investigate this matter rapidly, to discover the extent of these 
allegations and to ensure that all of those who might be involved are 
dealt with appropriately.'

Hagel also is directing all the services
 to retrain, recredential, and rescreen all sexual assault prevention 
and response personnel and military recruiters, Little said.

Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., chairman of 
the Senate Armed Services Committee, issued a statement Tuesday evening 
saying his panel is considering a number of measures to counter the 
problem, including changes to the Uniform Code of Military Justice, and 
will act on them next month.

'Tragically, the depth of the sexual 
assault problem in our military was already overwhelmingly clear before 
this latest highly disturbing report,' Levin said.

Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., said
 she intends to present new comprehensive legislation on Thursday to 
reform the military justice system by removing chain-of-command 
influence from prosecution of sex abuse crimes.

'To
 say this report is disturbing would be a gross understatement,' 
Gillibrand said. 'For the second time in a week we are seeing someone 
who is supposed to be preventing sexual assault being investigated for 
committing that very act.'

Earlier arrest: Lt. Col. Jeffrey Krusinski, an Air Force officer who led the branch's Sexual Assault Prevention and Response unit, was charged last week with groping a woman in a parking lot

House Armed Services Committee 
Chairman Howard P. 'Buck' McKeon, R-Calif., said in a statement he was 
'outraged and disgusted by the reports out of Fort Hood.'

McKeon,
 noting he has a granddaughter in the Army, said he saw 'no meaningful 
distinction between complacency or complicity in the military’s latest 
failure to uphold their own standards of conduct.

'Nor do I see a distinction between the service member who orchestrated this offense and the chain of command that was either oblivious to or tolerant of criminal behavior. Both are accountable for this appalling breach of trust with their subordinates.'

The Army announcement comes as the Pentagon continues to struggle with what it calls a growing epidemic of sexual assaults across the military.

In a report last week, the Defense Department estimated that as many as 26,000 military members may have been sexually assaulted last year, based on survey results.

Of those, fewer than 3,400 reported the incident, and nearly 800 of them simply sought help but declined to file formal complaints against their alleged attackers.

The military is struggling with a variety of sexual assault scandals, including an ongoing investigation into more than 30 Air Force instructors for assaults on trainees at Lackland Air Force Base, Texas.

Last week the Air Force’s head of sexual assault prevention was arrested on charges of groping a woman in a Northern Virginia parking lot.

A police report said that Air Force Lt. Col. Jeffrey Krusinski was drunk and grabbed a woman’s breast and buttocks. The woman fought him off and called police, the report said. A judge has set a July 18 trial date for Krusinski.

Congressional outrage over these incidents and two recent decisions by officers to overturn juries’ guilty verdicts in sexual assault cases has prompted outrage on Capitol Hill.

Air Force Lt. Gen. Craig Franklin reversed the conviction of Lt. Col. James Wilkerson, a former inspector general at Aviano Air Base in Italy, who was found guilty last year of charges of abusive sexual contact, aggravated sexual assault and three instances of conduct unbecoming an officer and a gentleman.

And Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., is holding up the nomination of Air Force Lt. Gen. Susan Helms, tapped to serve as vice commander of the U.S. Space Command, until McCaskill gets more information about Helms’ decision to overturn a jury conviction in a sexual assault case.

Members of Congress also met at the White House with senior administration officials to talk about measures to encourage more victims to come forward and ensure that perpetrators face justice.
