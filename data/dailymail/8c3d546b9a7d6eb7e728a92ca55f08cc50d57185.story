Anyone with any sympathy for the anti-capitalist movement may have been questioning their judgment yesterday.

This was the appalling scene of squalor left by Occupy protesters who camped out on a pretty London green to demonstrate against corporate greed.

With no running water or adequate toilet facilities, they managed to leave a putrid assortment of rubbish, rotting food and even human waste.

The camp at Finsbury Square, on the edge of London’s financial district, began in October as an extension of the Occupy movement’s protest at St Paul’s Cathedral.

The camp pictured on Tuesday before the moving began. It is estimated that the total cost to clean up the camps is going to exceed £100,000

But after 236 days of resistance, the protesters yesterday decided to call it a day and leave before bailiffs arrived.

A court order earlier this month gave Islington Council the go-ahead to evict the group and most knew their time was up. Sadly for local residents, the same protesters have now set up home a mile away in a family park.

Speaking from the new camp in Shoreditch Park, east London– made up of as many Portuguese and Poles as Britons – one of the occupiers said: ‘Bailiffs are just thugs. Rather than give them the pleasure of evicting us violently, we just moved on peacefully – and left them to clear up eight months of mess.’

The total cost to the taxpayer of 
moving the protesters is likely to exceed £100,000, when legal fees and 
the clean-up are factored in.  Local businesses were delighted to see 
the back of them.

Nathan Banning, of the Jo Bean coffee shop, said the protest had cost his business almost £50,000 in lost revenue.

He said: ‘It’s been hell these last few months.

‘It just descended into complete depravity and chaos.’

Occupy protestors, who were last night evicted from Finsbury Square in the City of London, have now set up a new camp in Shoreditch Park

The clear-out of the camp, made up of around 135 tents, started at 1am yesterday with no arrests taking place.

Council
staff now face the unenviable task of removing the filth. The ground 
soil has become so contaminated the top six inches will have to be 
replaced for anything to grow.

Now residents of the trendy Shoreditch Park face the prospect of a 
protracted fight to clear the area of the encampment, which started off with about ten tents but seems to have at least doubled in size by this afternoon.

A Metropolitan Police spokesman said:
'We are aware of tents pitched in Shoreditch Park.

'Officers are 
monitoring the situation but are not present at the scene. An 
appropriate policing plan is in place.'

Dozens of police officers and private security guards had taken several hours to clear anti-capitalist protesters from their north London camp after launching the swoop at 1am today.

New camp: Police were soon on the scene, but not before Occupy protesters were about to erect around a dozen tents in Shoreditch Park

Green but not so pleasant: Shoreditch Park has now been taken over by the Occupy London protesters who descended on the site within hours of being evicted from Finsbury Square

The camp was set up on the public land of the 
square in October, as an extension of the Occupy movement’s protest in 
St Paul’s Churchyard - which ended in eviction in February.

Today, Metropolitan Police confirmed they were present at the scene which is being cleared by a private security company.

Two weeks ago a judge heard the 
protest had caused £20,000 damage to the land, cost the council £26,000 
on security, and lost it £12,000 in rent plus income from the square’s 
restaurant which had to close.

There had been an adverse impact on 
local business and complaints about anti-social behaviour from the camp,
which increasingly became a focus for the homeless, and which had no 
running water or sufficient toilet facilities.

Councillor Paul Convery, Islington 
Council’s executive member for community safety, said: 'Finsbury Square 
is public space for the people of Islington, one of Britain’s most 
deprived boroughs.

'We’re returning the square to community use, and it is being cleaned and will soon be reopened to the public for the summer.

'Today’s enforcement action was peaceful and low-key, and I’d like to 
thank the police, our street outreach team, and other partner 
organisations for their help.

'A number of vulnerable and homeless people have been living in the 
square. We have been speaking to them and offering advice and support to
those who need assistance.'

Before
protesters were evicted from the neighbouring camp at St. Paul's 
Cathedral in February, Finsbury Square was used as an overspill.

It later became an 'eco village' where sustainable technologies were showcased.

But there was no sign of that now - the once pleasant park is now a barren, litter-strewn dump.

Until last night 20-30 'protestors' remained at the Finsbury Square camp - eight months after it was first 'occupied'

Islington Borough Council moved in March to start eviction proceedings against the 'residents' of Finsbury Square

Islington Borough Council moved in March to start eviction proceedings against the 'residents' of Finsbury Square.

But Tom McCarthy, a resident at Finsbury Square, insists the camp serves an important purpose.

He wrote on the Occupy Finsbury Square blog: 'This camp makes a political statement about our society.

'Since Occupy opened the camp on 21 
October, it has become a home and community for many homeless people, 
for whom the system has failed.

'In evicting this community, 
Islington Council – who have helped to re-home some people that have 
ticked certain boxes – are potentially leaving some people in a much 
worse position than they are already in.

'We
ask Islington Council to not go down the same route at the City of 
London Corporation – cleansing the City of homeless people is not the 
way forward. Helping to find real solutions is.'

At one time protesters used the square to showcase sustainable technology, but it is now a litter strewn dump

Islington Council claims the camp is now just occupied by vulnerable and homeless people

Banners erected on the camp preached anti-capitalist slogans, despite claims by councillors the square has become a haven for the homeless

Now the square has been repossessed Islington Borough Council are keen to start fixing the damage caused by protesters
