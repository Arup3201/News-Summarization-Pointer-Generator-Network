Ancient discovery: aria Pereira was found in the remote north-west Brazilian state of Acrel

A woman who claims to be 120-years old has been discovered in Brazil.

The indigenous Maria Lucimar Pereira would become the world's oldest living person - by six years - if the findings in the remote north-west Brazilian Amazon state of Acre are true.

At present American Besse Cooper, who was born on August 26, 1896 - making her nearly 115-years old - is regarded as the oldest in the world.

Though Mrs Pereira could be the rightful owner of her crown.

Staff for Brazilâ€™s National Institute
 of Social Security (INSS) have said that they found the elderly lady 
during routine checks of state birth records.

The
 birth certificate says she was born on September 3, 1890, which means 
that - if it is accurate - she will easily be the oldest person on the 
planet.

According to that birth certificate she is 120 years, nine months and 25 days old. Put another way, she has been on the planet for an amazing 44,128 days.

And, indeed, she is not too far away from becoming the oldest person ever to have lived.

Proof: Maria Pereira's birth certificate

Jeanne Calment, who died in August 1997 and claimed to have met artist Vincent van Gogh (1853-1890) in Arles - where she lived - is believed to be the oldest ever person.

The French lady reached the grand old age of 122 years and 164 days and claimed that her longevity was down to a life of leisure and tennis.

On the all-time list, Mrs Pereira - though unverified - would sit almost 18 months ahead of current second-place, American Sarah Knauss, who died in December 1999 aged 119 and 97 days.

Mrs Pereira, who is said to have 10 children and 22 grandchildren, is indigenous, and has reportedly lived almost all of her life on the remote reserve, where the nearest town being Feijo (population 32,261).

Proud family: Maria is looked after by her many relatives in the village

When the social workers checked her birth certificate they radioed the isolated indigenous community where she resides - there is no mobile reception - and organised to have her brought to the nearest town to confirm her identity.

According to friends and relatives, she is from the kaxinawa indigenous ethnic group, and speaks only a few words in Portuguese, the language used in the South American country.

The Brazilian social workers are still trying to verify if there were any mistakes made on her birth certificate, but no irregularities have been found so far.
