A luxurious riverside mansion on the Sunshine Coast has taken out three national design prizes including the top award, the National Building Design of the Year. 

The River House at the Sunshine Coast in Queensland also won in two other national categories set out by the National Association of Building Designers, including Best New Residential Design – over $1 million construction cost and Best Residential Interiors Design.

Gerard Smith, the two-storey home's principle designer from Gerard Smith Designs, said it was the cohesiveness of the layout plan that helped it win.

'It was a well-considered design for a complex building with meticulous detail and everything was well considered – that in its entirety appealed to the judges' Mr Smith told Daily Mail Australia.

'It's an open plan home that is designed to take full advantage of the beauty of the site and the river views - the conditions of the site and its own particular location really dictated the layout.'

While the owners of the home have chosen to keep their name and address anonymous in order to avoid unexpected visitors, Mr Smith did confirm that the magnificent white household is owned by a family with three young children.

'The family home has been designed with the current family requirements in mind – they have young children, but also so that it can grow and cater for changing family needs,' he said.

The five bedroom family home features an open-plan living design for its kitchen, living and dining areas 

Its other features include an external fireplace, a scullery and internal courtyard, a spa and water feature

The five bedroom house with an open plan kitchen living and dining room includes a number of luxurious features including an external fireplace, a scullery, an internal courtyard, a 25 metre lap pool with an infinity edge that connects to the river as well as a spa and water feature.

No riverside mansion would be complete without its own jetty and pontoon, both of which the contemporary home boasts.

Among the more lavish features, the master bedroom has been designed with its own 'parents retreat' according to Mr Smith, who said it includes a concealed kitchenette, balconies with long water views and a raised bath tub that takes full advantage of the view.

For the children, a kid's play zone has been worked into the design with an external playground featuring a dry river bed and a sand pit made with natural stone.

Designing a home deemed to have the best design in the country is not quick feat however, with Mr Smith revealing it took three years for the house to be completed. 

'From the start of the conception to completion of the build, it took approximately three years, so it was quite an extensive project. With the design – you refine and start documenting everything,' he said.

'There's quite an extensive level of documentation that takes 12 and 24 months to document a home.'

Mr Smith, whose previous designs have won the top award in the past, said he was honoured that the River House was recognized with the prize.

Up to 10 judges from across Australia reviewed various homes around the country within 17 different categories. 

The winner of each category then contested for the major award, the Building Design of the Year.
