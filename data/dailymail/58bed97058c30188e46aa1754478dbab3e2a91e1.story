Labour MP Paul Goggins has died at the age of 60

An MP who collapsed on a post-Christmas jog with his son has died after he suffered a massive brain haemorrhage.

Paul Goggins, 60, who ran regularly to keep fit and had been in good health, fell ill near his home last week.

The former Northern Ireland and Home Office minister was rushed to hospital after the drama near his Salford home on December 30, where doctors diagnosed a brain haemorrhage.

He was placed on a life support machine but on Tuesday night, with his family at his bedside, the Labour MP for Wythenshawe and Sale East in Greater Manchester lost his fight for life.

David Cameron, Ed Miliband and former Prime Minister Tony Blair paid tribute to Mr Goggins, calling the him a ‘dignified, humane, wise’ man.

His wife of 36 years, Wyn, 59, and three children, Matthew, 33, Theresa, 31, and Dominic, 28, said in a statement: ‘Our dear dad and husband died in hospital in Salford with us by his side. We are completely heartbroken.

'He had been very ill since collapsing last week.

‘We have been overwhelmed by the support and good wishes we have received from so many people – a real sign of love and a reflection of the sort of person Paul/dad was.’

As a young man, Mr Goggins studied at a Roman Catholic seminary but decided against entering the priesthood. Instead he became a social worker before being elected as MP for Wythenshawe and Sale East in 1997.

He quickly became widely liked and admired by both colleagues and constituents for his dedicated work and served in a number of posts in Westminster, including at the Home Office and as Northern Ireland minister.

Mr Goggins was also well-known as a keen runner and fundraiser and campaigned for compensation for the victims of asbestos-caused cancer.

Tributes: Labour leader Ed Miliband said Mr Goggins was ‘dignified, wise, humane and loyal’ and his family had been ‘devastated’ and Tony Blair said he was 'an outstanding public servant, a lovely man and a good friend'
