A shocking one in six inmates released from Guantanamo Bay prison have returned to terrorism, according to a U.S. intelligence report made public last week.

Of the 603 prisoners set free from the military facility, 100 are confirmed to have rejoined jihad against the West.

These include 17 ex-detainees that are dead, 27 that are in custody and 56 that are still free.

A further 74 former inmates at the notorious prison in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, are suspected of returning to terrorism, including two that are dead, 25 that are in custody and 47 that are free.

Alarmingly, three of the ex-Gitmo inmates confirmed as re-engaging in terrorism, and two suspected of terrorist activity, were released into the community in the past eight months, according to the report by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI).

Thomas Joscelyn, a terrorism analyst
 with the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, told Fox News that releasing prisoners from the detention facility increases the danger they will return to jihad.

'Once a detainee is transferred from 
Guantanamo to his home country, or a third country, there is no 
guarantee that appropriate security measures will be put in place,' he said.

'Thus, even detainees who are known to be very dangerous have rejoined the fight after leaving Guantanamo.'

The ODNI report, which is released every six months, also warned against the unconditional release of Guantanamo inmates, stating there was a risk they would 'reengage in terrorist or insurgent activities'.

It additionally highlighted the dangers posed by transferring ex-prisoners to countries with ongoing conflicts and active terrorist recruitment.

In May, President Obama announced he was lifting a ban on the transfer of Guantanamo prisoners to Yemen, where the al Qaeda affiliate is seen as a major threat.

He also pledged to renewed push to close the detention facility, which has recently provoked controversy over its restraint chair, operating theatre and force-feeding processes.

Feeding tube: The controversial procedure has been described by medical experts as unethical and dangerous

There are currently 164 inmates held at the prison, which costs the U.S. Defense Department around $150million a year to run.

During a recent hunger strike, more than 100 inmates
were strapped to a chair and kept alive with a liquid nutrient mix fed through
 a nasal tub - a process known as 'enteral feeding'.

Under the procedure, described by medical experts as unethical and dangerous, a prisoner who refuses nine successive meals or whose body weight drops significantly is offered a twice-daily can of a nutritional supplement, Ensure.

If he refuses, guards shackle him into the chair by his
 arms, head and feet, and a nurse inserts the tube up his nose, down the
 back of his throat and into his stomach.

Last month, William Lietzau, the Pentagon official in charge of Guantanamo Bay, admitted that, in hindsight, he believed the notorious detention camp should never have been built.
