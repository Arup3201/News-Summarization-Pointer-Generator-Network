Sydneysiders have used the hashtag 'Monopoly Sydney Edition' to vent their frustrations about living city life in the New South Wales capital.

Within two hours, hundreds of tweets containing the hashtag flooded social media along with suggestions of what features should be on the Sydney version of the well-known board game.

The posts poked fun at the state of the city's roads, politicians, hipster cafes and real estate affordability.

A Sydney version of Monopoly was released in 2012 (Lord Mayor Clover Moore is pictured with the game's mascot) but it did not stop people taking to social media to suggest improvements

Despite a Sydney edition of the game being released two years ago, it did not stop people from proposing improvements.

@allthepie took a swipe at Sydney's roads network.

'Drive to the airport on a Friday. Miss a turn and your flight,' she tweeted.

While, @_thomasparkes wanted the Community Chest to serve as a reminder of one of 2014's biggest political scandals.

While, @madcatjo2point0 suggested a change to the traditional metal board game tokens

Like many others on Twitter, @AyaReina took issue with Sydney's increasingly expensive cost of living

The well-known board game involves players selling, buying and expanding their property

'Community Chest: You have received a bottle of Grange, Go directly to jail,' he wrote on Twitter.

This referred to the $3,000 bottle of 1959 Grange wine which former NSW premier Barry O'Farrell failed to declare on pecuniary interests in 2011 after receiving it from then Australian Water Holdings (AWH) executive Nick Di Girolamo.

This oversight emerged while Mr O'Farrell was appearing as a witness during the ICAC inquiry.

After Mr O'Farrell claimed he forgot about the wine, it emerged he wrote a note thanking Mr Di Girolamo for the gift and this led to the former's resignation as premier.

@madcatjo2point0 suggested the traditional metal board game tokens of a wheelbarrow, battleship, racecar, thimble, old-style shoe, Scottie dog, top hat and cat should be ditched to keep up with the times.

'You can play as the Hipster Beard, Soy Latte, Harrys Cafe de Wheels Cart, or the Malfinctioning (sic) Opal Card Reader,' they said.

Like many others on Twitter, @AyaReina took issue with Sydney's increasingly expensive cost of living.

'Players under 55 can never buy a house, they just pay rent,' she wrote.
