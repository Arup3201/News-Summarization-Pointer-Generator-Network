Meghan McCain is getting her own show on a new TV network targeting the generation of Americans known as millennials.

'Raising McCain' will debut on Pivot, a general entertainment network that launches Aug. 1.

It's described as a documentary-talk series for viewers ages 15 to 34. McCain will star and serve as executive producer.

New show: Meghan McCain, who is to host her own documentary talk show Raising McCain, told the Television Critics Association on Friday that it lets her 'be crazy' and 'talk about issues'

The 28-year-old author and blogger told the Television Critics Association on Friday that the show lets her 'be crazy, be myself and talk about issues.'

She added to Vulture that though she has grown up in a political family, it would not steal the focus of the show.

'Politics is obviously in my life naturally in every way,' she said. 'It seeps in and out. But I wanted to talk about more than politics. The last election kind of killed my spirit. . . Politics is so polarizing and so partisan, and also people don’t know what to do with me because I’m the liberal Republican.'

'Dad did not love when I worked at MSNBC, but he has really been a great champion of this show'

Another perk of her show, she says, is that she does not have to wear a suit, and can kick around in Converse instead.

It is just as well. The show has seen her play kickball on one show, and hang from a trapeze on another.

'It was awful,' she said of the latter. 'Wait til you see. I can’t wait til that c**p hits the Internet. Never hang from a trapeze. I’m not scared of heights and it was horrible. It’s a lot more complicated than people realize. I hated it.'

McCain told the TCA that she's thrilled to be working on Pivot, which she describes as 'some sort of middle ground between the Kardashians and C-SPAN.

'I want to give people information but not talk down to them,' she said. 'I am so excited. This is the best thing I've ever done.'

McCain said her 76-year-old father, Republican Sen. John McCain, has already seen a highlight reel of her show.

'We have had conflicts many times. He did not love when I worked at MSNBC,' she said. 'He has really been a great champion of this show and believing that young people want more substance.'

The younger McCain, who is also a Republican, calls her generation the most politically engaged.

'I believe in more than this country is being given in news and entertainment,' she said.

Raising McCain premieres on Sept. 14.
