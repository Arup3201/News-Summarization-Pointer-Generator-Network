Upmarket soft drinks may seem like healthy alternatives to big names like Coca-Cola but they contain far more sugar, researchers warn today.

Ginger beer, prestige lemonade, dandelion and burdock, and sparkling elderflower are some of the options now on the shelves.

But they can come with as much as 13 teaspoons of sugar in a bottle.

Fizz: How the sugar content of a variety of soft drinks compares

Big brand and cheaper supermarket versions of Coca-Cola and Pepsi weigh in at around nine teaspoons.

That compares to six or more teaspoons typically found in eight out of ten other high street fizzy drinks.

Health campaigners who compiled the figures warn that adults and  children are consuming huge quantities of hidden sugar in processed food and drink, which is fuelling obesity and poor health.

The World Health Organisation recommends a drastic cut to a maximum of about 25g a day, which equates to six teaspoons.

But Action on Sugar analysed 232 popular drinks and found that 79 per cent contained this amount of sugar in a single 330ml serving.

Restrained: Big brand colas such as Pepsi have significantly;y less sugar than many alternatives

The group is urging Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt to put pressure on manufacturers and supermarkets to make their drinks less sweet by cutting sugar levels.

Chairman Professor Graham MacGregor said: ‘Added sugars are completely unnecessary in our diets and are strongly linked to obesity and type 2 diabetes.’

Prof MacGregor, of the Wolfson Institute, London, also warned that sugar was adding to the major problem of dental decay.

He said: ‘Replacing sugar with sweeteners is not the answer, we need to reduce overall sweetness so people’s tastes can adjust to having less sweet drinks.’

A similar approach has led to a 15 per cent drop in salt intake over ten years, saving 9,000 lives a year plus reducing annual health spending by £1.5billion, added the professor. He said: ‘It is time to do the same for sugar.’

The research found that sugar levels in apparently similar products showed wide variations, suggesting the amount could be cut.Kawther Hashem, nutritionist at Action on Sugar, advised: ‘Look on the label for “sugar per 100g” and switch to a lower or no added sugar variety, or even better, don’t drink them, they contain nothing of any nutritional value.’

The British Soft Drinks Association claimed the campaigners were ‘blinded by political zeal’.

Director general Gavin Partington said manufacturers ‘have led the way in providing an increasing range of low and no-calorie drinks’.

Dr Glenys Jones, nutritionist at Sugar Nutrition UK, a body financed by manufacturers, said: ‘Like all sources of calories, sugars and sugar-containing food and drinks can be consumed within a healthy, balanced diet and active lifestyle.’
