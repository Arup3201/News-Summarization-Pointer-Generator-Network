Donna Fallon was a 'normal', 40-year-old housewife and mother-of-three when she discovered her psychic powers.

The softly-spoken Liverpudlian was informed she had the gift by a medium, while being given a reading of her own, and immediately began testing it out.

Now aged 49 and living in Cambridgeshire, Donna has spent the last nine years building a trusted client base of people who visit her for spiritual meetings with departed loved ones, tarot card readings and soul healing sessions.

And it's a list that includes celebrity faces such as former-TOWIE star Amy Childs, former-WAG Lizzie Cundy and former-EastEnder Cheryl Fergison, Tamara Eccleston and Colleen Rooney.

'Everyone comes to see me for different reasons,' Donna told MailOnline. 'And all sessions are different, depending on why they are there.

'I tend to begin sessions by asked their loved ones in the spirit world why they have come, as that's often the best way.'

Donna - who last night tweeted a photograph of herself with Amy Childs after giving her a reading - says she would never reveal anything about her clients, or what happens during a session.

'I do have a lot of celebrity clients, including several people from the TOWIE cast, and they often recommend me to other celebrities, but I would never speak about what happens in the sessions. Amy is a lovely girl.'

'People may come because they're wondering about their job, or their relationship, or they want to speak to loved ones who have passed away.

'Most people want a bit of guidance and direction in their lives. I never tell anyone what to do or if they are going to die. Life is so full of trauma anyway - I want to give them hope.'

Donna describes herself as 'a spiritual supermarket', saying: 'You can come to me for spiritual messages, tarot readings and soul healings. All three in one place!'

She says she has spoken to a woman who miscarried, and told her precisely when she would fall pregnant again; she has helped one mother grieve over a young son lost in the Hillsborough disaster, by carrying messages between them; and she allowed one woman to forgive herself for not being by her mother's side when she died, because her mother appeared to Donna and told her it was OK.

When asked why she won't give people direct advice about what to do in life, Donna explains that 'there has to be free will', adding: 'I can give them only guidance. Maybe I'll see their loved one who will tell them they're stuck in a rut, but I can't lead people into decisions that might be wrong.

'A woman who came to see me yesterday said the last psychic she'd seen had told her to break up with her boyfriend. I didn't see that at all, and I certainly wouldn't have told her if I had! It might have been the biggest mistake of her life.'

Donna - pictured with former EastEnder Cheryl Fergison - says she will never actually tell people what to do with their lives, as there needs to be an element of free will

Donna gives readings in an annexe of her house in Cambridgeshire, thus enabling her to keep her work and personal lives separate.

But juggling the roles of psychic and mother hasn't always been easy.

When she first began doing readings Donna's son, now 16, asked 'why I couldn't work in Tesco like all the other mums'.

But now they're older - her other children are 21 and 18 - they are very supportive of what she does.

'I support Everton so do charity readings at matches, and now my son is pleased he gets free merchandise!'

But when it comes to reading her own family, Donna is hesitant.

'I never do readings for my husband or family: emotion clouds judgement. I did tarot with my eldest daughter once to give her some direction, and I do my husband once a year, but I don't tune into my kids.

'They have to be allowed to have secrets, there has to be something personal. To my kids I'm just mum, and we're the last people to know if they have a girlfriend or boyfriend!'

Donna is now planning on running spiritual retreats to teach people how to give readings. For more information visit her website
