Jose Mourinho is intent on bringing Borussia Dortmund winger Marco Reus to Chelsea next summer, according to reports in Spain.

Marca  claim that the Blues boss has made the Germany international his No 1 target at the end of this season as he looks to strengthen his squad.

The Spanish newspaper believe Mourinho will face strong competition from La Liga leaders Real Madrid, who have already agreed a 'right to buy' with the Bundesliga side.

Elsewhere in Europe and Italy's papers are also dominated by transfer talk, with La Gazzetta dello Sport focusing on five players whose contracts expire next summer.
