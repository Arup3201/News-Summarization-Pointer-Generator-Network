Manchester United's £30million summer signing Luke Shaw has been named in Gareth Southgate's England Under 21 squad to face Croatia.

Shaw is joined by Arsenal's Calum Chambers, who earns his first call-up to the England Under 21 squad, and West Brom forward Saido Berahino for the first leg of the Euro 2015 play-off at Molineux on October 10.

Southgate's men will then travel to Vinkovci for the return match four days later.

Luke Shaw, in action for Man United against West Ham on Saturday, has been selected by Gareth Southgate 

Don't rush Saido Berahino and Co into full England side... they'll have a bigger test in Under 21s than against San Marino 

Shaw was taken to Brazil for last summer's torrid World Cup campaign, but he has struggled to find his feet at Old Trafford following his high-profile move from Southampton. 

Chambers meanwhile will feature for the England Under 21s for the first time after making his debut for the senior side last month. 

There had been calls for Berahino, who has scored five goals this season, to be promoted to the senior squad. But the West Brom forward will join up with Southgate's squad at St. George's Park on Sunday evening. 

Saido Berahino's scored five goals for West Brom this term, but missed out on a promotion to the senior side
