Worries: 5ft 3in Kate Miller in 2010 when she dropped from 8st to 6 st

When Kate Miller started at university and rapidly lost weight, she thought the change in her lifestyle was most likely to blame.

'I'd gone from enjoying healthy home-cooked food living at home with my parents to living a typical student's life in Leeds - going out five nights a week and surviving on takeaways and pot noodles,' she recalls.

But that Christmas, with Kate having dropped from 8 st to 6 st (she is 5ft 3in), her friends and family began to fear she was in the grip of an eating disorder.

'My mum started weighing me each time I came home, and with my weight dropping off, she said if I kept losing weight she'd pull me out of uni,' says Kate.

'I always said to her I didn't understand it because I was eating more than ever. But because I was thirsty all the time, I also kept slipping away after meals to go to the loo. It looked suspicious.

'Then I heard her and my dad talking about how worried they were about me, and my friends were asking me all the time why I was losing weight.'

The family were very worried Kate might have anorexia. 'I knew everyone thought I had an eating disorder, which was upsetting,' says Kate.

'But far from having an eating disorder, I was hungry all the time so actually eating more than ever. Some days, I'd eat 4,000 calories - but the weight was still falling off me.

'At the same time, I was experiencing double vision and dizzy spells and fainting. One night, shortly after Christmas, I went to the toilet at 2am, fainted and woke up at 7am on the bathroom floor.

'When I tried to Google my symptoms, the only thing I could really think it might be was anaemia.'

Kate was also suffering from an ankle injury which wouldn't heal. 'I'd sprained it on a night out in November. I thought it would take a few days to heal, but it just didn't improve, and I ended up having to wear a tubigrip all the time.'

Kate was one of the estimated 850,000 people in the UK with undiagnosed diabetes, where blood glucose (also known as blood sugar) levels become too high.

Glucose comes from the carbohydrates we eat and the body uses it as fuel. The hormone insulin breaks it down and transports it into the cells.

Diabetes occurs when the pancreas does not produce enough insulin to help glucose enter your body's cells - or the body becomes resistant to the insulin it does produce, says Pav Kalsi, clinical advisor to the charity Diabetes UK.

As a result, glucose stays in your blood, where it cannot be used as fuel and also harms blood vessels, nerves and organs. Long-term complications from poorly-controlled diabetes include nerve damage, kidney failure and blindness.

There are two forms of diabetes. Type 1, which develops rapidly, occurs when the insulin-producing cells in the body have been destroyed.

Shock: Kate in February 2011, when she was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes

'We do not know for certain why this happens, but type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune condition, in which the immune system mistakes the body's insulin producing cells as harmful and attacks them,' says Mr Kalsi.

'The body is unable to produce any insulin at all, and the patient's deterioration is rapid and very visible. Type 1 diabetes can develop at any age but usually appears before the age of 40, and especially in childhood.' Symptoms include frequent urination, feeling thirsty and tired, and weight loss (because when it's starved of fuel, the body breaks down its own fat and muscle).

Type 2 diabetes develops at a much slower pace, and occurs when the body can still make some insulin, but not enough, or when the insulin that is produced does not work properly.

Mr Kalsi says: 'This form of diabetes usually occurs in people over the age of 40, and is linked to risk factors such as being overweight, which causes the body to become resistant to insulin.

'It takes people longer to realise that they have type 2 diabetes, or go for check-ups, because they mistake the symptoms such as being tired or needing the loo more as a part of getting older. Most of the people with undiagnosed diabetes have type 2 diabetes, but some have type 1.'

With her weight loss, dizzy spells and continuing fainting, Kate finally went to see her GP in February. He measured her blood sugar levels and sent her straight to hospital.

'It was really frightening,' recalls Kate. 'I thought I was just going for a check-up, and had even taken a friend with me. Next thing I knew the doctor was talking about calling an ambulance.

'In the end, I went in a taxi and my mum was racing down the motorway to Leeds from her home in Newcastle to meet me there.'

Kate underwent tests and within a matter of hours was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes.

'It was devastating and very frightening. I'd heard of diabetes, but I didn't fully understand what it was and it sounded as though my entire life was about to change. The specialist was talking about me seeing a nutritionist and having a check-up every two months and I was terrified.

'My mum was in tears. She felt she should have known, and prevented it, but the nurses kept telling her there would have been nothing she could have done. My mum also said she was so sorry she'd thought I had an eating disorder. It was such a shock, especially as there isn't a history of diabetes in my family.'

To this day, Kate has no idea why she suddenly developed diabetes, but it is thought the autoimmune condition could be linked to a virus, or she could have had a genetic predisposition to it.

Kate was told it was the high sugar levels that had prevented her ankle from healing, as the body's immune cells - responsible for healing - do not work properly when blood sugar is high.

Two weeks later she underwent an MRI scan to check if her high blood sugar levels had caused any long-term damage to her organs or nervous system. It had, and she now has to wear glasses because her retinas - the light sensitive area at the back of each eye - have been damaged, a common complication with the condition.

Living life to the full: Kate know she has to be more responsible since her diagnosis but she's looking forward to a healthy, normal future

She also had to immediately start insulin injections - which means counting her carbohydrate intake to calculate how much insulin she needs. (Patients with type 2 diabetes are treated with medication in tablet form, alongside diet and lifestyle changes, although some end up needing insulin injections.)

The good news is diabetes can be successfully managed over the long term. 'If patients make the right diet changes, take insulin and attend their appointments, it's likely they can avoid all the complications of diabetes,' says Mr Kalsi.

Today, two years after diagnosis, Kate - who has recently graduated with a degree in journalism - has to inject herself with insulin up to ten times daily, depending on what she has eaten.

Kate says: 'Because I was a student at the time, I wanted to still feel fairly free and not stick to too rigid a diet, so I focused on learning really accurate carbohydrate counting.

'I can eat whatever I want: I just have to inject the right amount of insulin, into either my tummy or my leg, to cover the carbohydrates I've eaten. That means on some days, if I eat salad and lean meat, I only inject once, but on another day, if I had a burger in a bun, I might inject many times.

'The first time I injected I was nervous, but you quickly get used to it.' Kate's weight is now back to 8 st and her ankle is fully healed.

'I've got reading glasses now, which is a bit annoying, but I just tell myself how lucky I am,' she says.

'If I hadn't gone to the GP when I did, my blood sugar levels would have escalated further and I could have slipped into a coma.

'The consequences then would have been far more serious. I still try to live my life to the full. I have to be more responsible than I did before, but I'm coming to terms with living with a chronic condition. I'm looking forward to a bright, normal and perfectly healthy future.'
