Kmart has launched its Christmas advertising campaign more than 100 days before the holiday in a desperate bid to beat off the competition.

But the extra-early ad blitz has infuriated shoppers who've taken to the retailer's Facebook page to slam the out-of-season commercial. 

Industry analysts say the unprecedented move will bring forward the Christmas ad cycle 'by a few weeks' as competitors jump on the promotional bandwagon.

What the? Kmart has enraged customers by airing its first Christmas advertisement about its layaway program - featuring a gingerbread man - more than 100 days before the holiday

Market leader: Ad industry analysts say Kmart's decision to air a Christmas ad this week will move the Christmas ad cycle up 'by a few weeks'

The 
commercial, which first aired on September 8, promotes the retailer's layaway program.

It features a 
gingerbread man sneaking up on a woman working in an office cubicle, with a voice over saying: 'Don't let the holidays sneak up on you. Shop early with
 Kmart free layaway.'

Almost instantly, the retailer's Facebook page was brimming with complaints.

One customer wrote: 'What happened to Halloween and thanksgiving? Stop with the Christmas commercials ALREAY! [sic]'.

Another wrote: 'I WON'T be shopping at Kmart at Christmas. This is just a money making scheme. Kmart is only eager for the dollar signs. Places that start Christmas too early don't get my money. Christmas is NOT about gifts...it's about Jesus and family.'

Unperturbed by the backlash, Kmart merely thanked its critics: 'We're just really excited for the holidays and layaway!'

Last year, Kmart's first holiday ad aired on October 28, behind Target's infamous October 15 promotional launch.

Secret Santa: A Kmart spokeswoman said the ad is being 'tweaked' but refused to comment on the retailer's holiday strategy

A Kmart
 spokeswoman said the ad was being 'tweaked', but would not comment on the company's broader holiday strategy.

'Customers can plan in advance in order to take advantage of layaway for holiday purchases,' Kmart said in a statement to ABC News.

Armed with National Retail Federation data showing 40 percent of holiday shoppers start buying before Halloween, several retailers have already announced their layaway schemes.

On August 22, Walmart announced plans to launch free layaway from September 13 to December 13, officially kicking off the start to the holiday season, according to ABC News.

Ace Metrix executive VP-marketing, Jonathan Symonds, 
said it's important that 
layaway ads are released early, but admitted it's 'eye 
opening' that Kmart is out of the gate six to eight weeks earlier than normal. 

'There might not be creative to respond with in the 
pipeline,' Symonds told Ad Age.

'It will, by definition, create a slightly 
earlier cycle. As opposed to right before Halloween, it will have the 
impact of pulling the season up by a few weeks. But it won't start the 
race today.'

National Retail Federation spokeswoman Kathy 
Grannis said Kmart's early blitz would boost competition in the sector.

'This 
might give new meaning to the phrase Christmas Creep,' she said. 'It's anybody's game right now, wheels are definitely in motion for a
 very promotional holiday season.'
