Australian Olympic swimmer Grant Hackett is making his return to competitive swimming, announcing that he will compete at the national titles next year.

The 34-year-old revealed his comeback to The Sunday Telegraph, just two months after he was first pictured back at training with his former coach Denis Cotterell.

Hackett will race at the titles in Sydney in 2015, and is living on the Gold Coast training after quitting his job at Westpac.

The triple-Olympic gold medallist has previously denied that he was using his base on Queensland's glitzy strip to mount a comeback to competitive swimming, or that he is charging toward the 2016 Rio Olympics.

According to the Telegraph he is now training alongside friend and ironman Ky Hurst, and swimming six days a week under Cotterell while mentoring some of the younger members of the team.

Hackett told the newspaper he is wary of staging a 'fantasy' comeback as former rival Ian Thorpe did unsuccessfully, and said it would be disrespectful to suggest he could do successfully what Thorpe could not.

'(Thorpe) didn't make comebacks look overly attractive, it was probably more of a deterrent,' he said.

He also said it would be disrespectful to claim he could master a comeback while Thorpe, who he could not beat in his prime, could not.

Hackett added that his age was also a potential hurdle, but he is in a better place mentally and physically than he has been for a decade.

The swimming star stopped short of admitting he was embarking on a full comeback, saying he currently is happy swimming for his club

'I probably haven't felt this good since 2003 or 2004 ... This year I've just really got my passion back for it,' the former Olympian told the Telegraph.

The 34-year-old also revealed that his body has responded better than expected to intense training, and he has regained fitness levels surprisingly quickly.

Hackett said his focus is on competing in a club relay with his teammates, he would be happy to go further if circumstances allowed.

When asked by journalist Todd Balym whether he would consider competing for Australia if his times allowed, Hackett didn't shoot the idea down.

He won three gold medals during his swimming career, before his retirement in 2008

The swimmer admitted he would 'never say never' to racing in the relay team for his country again.

Just two months ago Daily Mail Australia published what Hackett's manager Chris White believed to be the first images of the swimming star in the pool since his retirement in 2008. 

Hackett told Daily Mail Australia at the time he was just enjoying his return to the water after a tumultuous six years since his retirement.

'I'm thoroughly enjoying being back on the Gold Coast,' he said, 'and I'm keen to remain fit, enjoy a healthy lifestyle and re-establish myself with the community here,' the 24-year-old said.

'Swimming is the ideal mix for both.'

He would not be drawn into speculation regarding his future in the sport, other than to say the training regime back in October was just part of his goal to 'remain fit.'
