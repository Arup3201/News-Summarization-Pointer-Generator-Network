We've all been there. The ball takes a bobble when you're six yards out, and you fire it high over the bar. You swing too early and the sweet strike you've pictured in your head is but a distant memory.

Fortunately, it happens to professional footballers too... even the very best. Step forward Adam Szalai, Klaas-Jan Huntelaar and - twice - Junior Malanda.

Sportsmail counts down the top 10 Bundesliga misses of 2014... 

10) Johannes Geis - Mainz

'High, wide and not very handsome,' as the commentator described it. Admittedly, this isn't your typical miss from close range. 

Attempting to whip a free-kick in from the left wing, Johannes Geis' cross ends up in Row Z of the Mainz crowd. As he steps up to the ball, his left foot lifts up the turf and the final ball looks more like a rugby conversion than a football free-kick.

 9) Adam Szalai - Hoffenheim

Partly a terrible miss, partly a cracking save. As if facing Bundesliga champions Bayern Munich wasn't hard enough, Adam Szalai will be kicking himself that he didn't make the most of this gilt-edged opportunity.

Dead centre, in the 16-yard-box, the ball fell to the Hubgarian striker, who chested the ball down ready to fire it home. Unfortunately for him - and his team, who went on to lose 4-0 - the ball had little power, and Manuel Neuer was able to poke it away from danger.

8) Klaas-Jan Huntelaar - Schalke

'The Hunter' as he has been affectionately named, has scored 66 goals in 112 appearances for Schalke. 38 in 69 for the Netherlands, too. But when the ball fell to the 31-year-old in the centre of the goal, he was simply not able to stick it in the back of the net.

Proof, it seems, that it happens to the best of us. Thankfully for Huntelaar, Schalke went on to beat Hertha Berlin 2-0.

Huntelaar has been nicknamed 'The Hunter' due to his impressive scoring record, but he missed this chance

7) Christian Gentner - Stuttgart

Stuttgart's stalwart Christian Gentnder had a moment to forget at Werder Bremen this year. His team lost 2-0, so it's firmly a case of what might have been had he headed home from close range.

Somehow, he gets it all wrong and heads the ball directly into the ground, before it bounces up over the bar. An empty goal, and what should have been an easy finish...

Stuttgart's Christian Gentner should have cushioned his header into the net, but he puts it high and wide

6) Raffael - Borussia Monchengladbach

From a contender for goal of the season, to a contender for miss of the season in a split-second. What starts as a wonderful team move finishes with a disappointing miss.

To be fair to Raffael, there's a brilliant piece of defending on the line to save a certain goal. But it's a strike that would have been his side win, with the scores at 1-1 with less than two minutes remaining.

Raffael didn't show the touch of a Brazilian when he shot at the defender on the line

5) Sebastian Freis - Freiburg

It's a striker's dream. Right place, right time. A shot is spilled by the opposition goalkeeper and you're there to mop up and collect the praise. But for Freiburg's Sebastian Freis, he had a moment to forget when the ball fell to his feet in a match against Stuttgart this year.

He shot, but the ball flew high and wide of a target that was gaping in front of him. To rub salt in the wounds, his team went on to lose 4-1. Not their day. 

Sebastian Freis was gifted with a chance when the keeper spilled it, but he put the ball wide

4) Roel Brouwers - Borussia Monchengladbach

He did everything but the finish. Roel Brouwers is the second Borussia Monchengladbach player in this countdown, after his terrible miss against Bayer Leverkusen.

The corner flew in from the right, and Brouwers got lucky with a touch off the defender. He is left with just the keeper to beat, but puts the ball over the bar.

3) Junior Malanda - Wolfsburg

Wolfsburg's Junior Malanda is in at three... and it's not his only appearance on this countdown. A fantastic ball is whipped in from the right, but the Belgian defensive midfielder gets himself in a tangle and can not put the ball in the back of the net.

2) Junior Malanda - Wolfsburg

The phrase, 'It was harder to miss' has never been more true. Junior Malanda, take a bow. Less than a yard out, his initial shot lands at his feet for him to poke home. But alas, he somehow - inexplicably - puts the ball wide.

In a quite remarkable miss, Malanda puts the ball wide from very, very close range

1) Philipp Hofmann - KC Kaiserslautern 

There aren't sufficient words to describe this miss. Simple doesn't do it justice. Easy isn't strong enough. This is, quite simply, atrocious. 

Philipp Hofmann of Kaiserslautern certainly won't be living this down for a good few years to come. 

In at number one, Kaiserslautern's Philipp Hofmann manages to put the ball over the bar from a yard out
