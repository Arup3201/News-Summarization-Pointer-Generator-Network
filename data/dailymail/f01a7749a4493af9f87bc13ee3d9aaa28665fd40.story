It's not time to play the music. For Lewis Hamilton has said the building of his ‘brand’ after Formula One — possibly in a recording studio — must not cloud his determination to win a third world championship.

Hamilton has been a regular at showbusiness events in the close season, but now his red private jet has touched down in Melbourne and his focus has switched to the defence of his title in the opening race of the campaign.

Nonetheless, his life is something of a juggling act. Yes, winning races is by far the most important thing, yet he has engaged transatlantic PR and talent agencies to polish his image after a split from Simon Fuller, who shaped ‘Brand Beckham’.

Is that ‘brand’ something Hamilton wants to replicate?

‘At the moment, it’s winning championships that counts,’ he said. ‘I don’t wish to stop racing but I’m conscious I’m halfway through my career, or maybe gone past halfway, and that the next six, seven or however many years I get will come and go. Whatever steps I take now will determine what I do after.

‘I don’t want to be a commentator, although I think I’d be OK at it because I obviously know a lot about the sport, but there are other things I would like to try. So it’s exploring those and building a foundation.’

Does that mean music? ‘I’m continuing to plod along and enjoy my music when I get time,’ said Hamilton. ‘But I haven’t been in the studio since January, and just for a couple of days. That’s the least music I’ve done during a winter for some time.

‘Music is more of my life than people are aware of. When you’re doing music you have a choice of how much you want to show and how vulnerable you want to be. I approach it just as a hobby, something I enjoy. It’s therapeutic.

‘I like to have feedback from people who are experienced. I’ve never been tempted to release anything but I’ve not had the worst of comments about my songs, either.’

Hamilton has spoken about several post-career avenues, including an acting role in Hollywood. He rules out very little.

Hamilton described his Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg as 'an honourable, respectful man' 

‘Growing up, I was restricted in knowing, learning and being made aware of my creative side,’ he said of a young lifetime spent going from kart track to kart track under the eyes of his controlling father, Anthony, and the strict discipline of McLaren.

‘There are things I’m really quite creative at, so I’m going to see where that takes me. I am good at designing. I did my whole house. I have done my steering wheel for some time. I might indulge in trying to design clothes or something. Just do my own stuff. I’d like to do something with cars.’

Which brings us from hobbies back to business and a year in which Hamilton’s Mercedes team will again dominate, according to the crushing figures from pre-season testing. That sets up a private duel: Hamilton versus Nico Rosberg, the sequel.

Their relationship became rancorous last season but ended with a hug in Abu Dhabi. It was a magnanimous gesture from the vanquished Rosberg. ‘An honourable, respectful man,’ was Hamilton’s verdict at Mercedes’ factory in Brackley last week.

‘My relationship with Nico is as good as 12 months ago,’ he added. ‘It seems quite good, to be honest. But it’s when you get in the heat of the moment and there’s... you know, you have to assume there’s going to be moments where there’s going to be bits of tension, but that’s because we’re fierce competitors.

Hamilton insisted he is unfazed by Rosberg's efforts to beat him in the upcoming season

Hamilton is confident that he will be able to defend his title in the season that starts in Melbourne

‘You are conflicted because you are trying to get the team to win, but you also want to win yourself. We managed it well, particularly at the end of last season.’

Rosberg, whose wife Vivian is expecting their first baby in August (classic German efficiency — a birth in the sport’s summer break, as one of his lieutenants observed), has said publicly he can win the title. Hamilton is unfazed.

‘You have to assume each driver is going to get better,’ he said. ‘I’m sure Nico is training harder. I’m sure he is studying more and trying everything under the sun to make sure he finishes ahead of me. That’s what I’ve been facing since I was 10 so it’s no different, really.’
