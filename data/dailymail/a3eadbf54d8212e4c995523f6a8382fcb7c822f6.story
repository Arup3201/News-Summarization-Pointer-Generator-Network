A pastry chef who raped and murdered Irish journalist Jill Meagher in Australia last year has been sentenced to life in prison.

Adrian Bayley, 41, had already admitted the rape and murder of journalist Mrs Meagher after he attacked her in a lane in the Melbourne suburb of Brunswick in September last year, as she walked home after socialising with colleagues from the Australian Broadcasting Corporation.

He was told by a judge at Melbourne's Supreme Court that he must serve a minimum 35 year sentence for the 'savage and degrading' crime.

Bayley was sentenced to life for 29 year old Miss Meagher's murder and 15 years for what Judge Geoff Nettle described as a violent rape.

Jailing Bayley, he said: 'The deceased was unknown to you. You were larger and stronger than she and you used that physical advantage to dominate her.

'In effect, you dragged her off the street late at night while she was going peaceably about her own business within a stone's throw of her home.

'The rape was savage and degrading.'

Bayley had previously been found 
guilty of 21 rape offences and was on parole for attacking five 
prostitutes when he assaulted the County Louth woman in September last 
year.

In 2002, he was sentenced to 11 years 
for raping five prostitutes, but was freed on parole in 2011, which 
would have lasted until March this year.

Flanked by six police officers, Bayley looked emotionless as the judge passed sentence today.

Justice Nettle told Bayley, who had pleaded guilty to rape and murder at an earlier hearing, that he posed a serious risk to the safety of the community.

Mrs Meagher's family - parents George 
and Edith McKeon, her brother Michael and husband Tom Meagher - were in 
the court to hear the sentencing.

Outside
the court, her father Mr McKeon, said in a brief statement that 
'justice has been done' and he thanked the police and prosecutors for 
their work.

The court had 
heard that Mrs Meagher had gone out earlier that evening with friends 
from the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, and ended up in a bar in 
the inner-city suburb of Brunswick.

At
around 1.30am she set off home, telling a friend that she lived only 
five minutes walk away and it was then that Bayley, who had also been 
out drinking, spotted her.

Bayley told police he had offered to 
help her because she appeared upset after speaking on her phone about 
her father's state of health, but when she rejected his offer it made 
him angry.

He had told 
police later that after Mrs Meagher had been raped he strangled her with
his hands because she had threatened to tell the police about what he 
had done.

In a 40 minute address to Bayley, Justice Nettle told the court how Bayley had left Mrs Meagher's body in the alleyway while he returned to his home and collected his car and a shovel.

He drove her body to the Gisborne South countryside and buried her in a shallow grave.

Bayley threw random possessions of Mrs Meagher's from his car window on the way home and later destroyed her mobile phone before trying to clean any evidence out of his car the following day.

He was caught after police reviewed a 
series of CCTV tapes taken on the road where Mrs Meagher went missing 
and thanks to a number of witnesses who came forward to help detectives.

Justice Nettle recalled how Bayley had at first denied any involvement in Miss Meagher's death but as the interrogation continued and evidence was presented to him, Bayley began to make admissions which culminated in a confession that he had raped and killed the Irish woman.

He told Bayley: 'The combination of rape and murder of the kind you have committed is particularly heinous and, in your case, it is made even worse by your attempt to conceal the deceased's body and the fact that the offending was committed while you were released on parole and on bail.'

The judge told Bayley that he was 'determined to have your way with her and so you overpowered her and raped her where she stood.

'Then you attacked her again because she was threatening to call then police and in the process you strangled her to death.'
