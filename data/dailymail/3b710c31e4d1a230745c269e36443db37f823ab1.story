Baked beans have been given a posh makeover by Fortnum & Mason.

The 18th-century department store known for its rather posh preserves is selling a brand which has added onions, apple - and even bacon to the humble baked bean. While the concoction certainly sounds palatable, the price might make you think twice.

At £3.95 for a pot of Proper Beans it's a big ask to dig deep for what you're used to spending no more than £1 on. But we conducted a taste test and found these beans are twice as good as Heinz - and 10 times tastier than Waitrose.

MailOnline's Deni Kirkova taste tested four beans including Waitrose, Tesco, Heinz and Fortnum & Mason

Fortnum & Mason in fact first introduced baked beans to Britain in 1886. The once-revolutionary product is nowadays considered the cheap and cheerful preserve of students and children.

But the retailer is changing the face of dining once more by reinventing the humble toast-topper into an upmarket side.

Proper Beans Founder Ben Mason, 33, 
decided to turn the market on its head, bringing recipes back to their 
origins with gourmet versions of the humble staple. He had the idea for the brand from his father.

‘He told 
me that he makes his own baked beans and it struck me as strange that 
I'd never thought of it as something you can cook from scratch,' he 
says.

'It's
 crazy that tinned baked beans are a hugely successful universal 
product, and yet nothing has really changed with them in so many years. 
Why haven't they improved like all the other food we eat?.'

Far from being processed and tinned, his handmade beans are hand cooked with fresh ingredients including free-range meats and are found in the chilled section.

Proper Beans are available in four varieties: such as smoked bacon & English mustard

The tasty gourmet side contained onions, tomato and chunky, meaty bacon

Recipes range from the classic pork, haricot beans and tomatoes (the origin of what we know as baked beans today) to vegetarian recipes and some more experimental ingredients such as British-grown fava beans.

Proper Beans are available in four varieties: such as smoked bacon & English mustard - a pork and haricot bean combination inspired by classic baked bean recipes.

1. Fortum & Mason Proper Beans, £3.95, 'a gourmet side'

2. Heinz barbecue beans, 82p, 'comforting toast topper'

3. Tesco baked beans & pork sausages, 50p, 'processed hangover food'

4. Waitrose organic baked beans, 62p, 'vinegary and watery'

They certainly were the tastiest - but we don't recommend using them as toast topping

After spending a year experimenting in his kitchen in Elephant and Castle, London, Ben left behind his job in advertising and decided to spend his life savings on starting Proper Beans.

Ben: ‘The main focus for me was the taste. You can't reproduce a tin of baked beans at home; the ingredients are far too processed. Proper Beans are fresh, handmade and there's nothing in them that you couldn't buy at the supermarket. They taste so much better and they're just so much better for you.

'When I first told people that I resigned from my job and I was going into making baked beans some said "you're completely crazy".

Most people think that beans can't change - always the same colour, and consistency. But as soon as they tried them, they realise what baked beans can and should be'

Proper Beans are available in the chilled aisle at Fortnum and Masons at £3.95.

Waitrose organic, at 62p, taste 'vinegary' - and are not worth the money, according to our taste test (l) as Heinz barbecue beans, 82p, were comforting and definitely one to pop on toast in chilly winter (r)

Proper Beans are currently available in four varieties, and more are coming out soon - £3.95 each
