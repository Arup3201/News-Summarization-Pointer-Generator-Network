A woman has been arrested in connection with Monday night's arson attack on the famed Mrs Doubtfire home in San Francisco.

The name of the female suspect has not yet been released but police say she's a former a patient of the property's current owner, 79-year-old Dr. Douglas Ousterhout - a prominent plastic surgeon in the area.

The two fires she's believed to have started with petrol caused minor damage to the garage door and front door of the million-dollar Queen Anne-style home.

The house in Pacific Heights, San Francisco was used in the 1993 Robin Williams film Mrs Doubtfire

The house, which is on the junction of Steiner and Broadway in Pacific Heights, became a shrine last August following the suicide of Robin Williams who played Mrs Doubtfire in the hit 1993 comedy.

Luckily only scorch marks were left on the building following the incident on Monday.

Dr Ousterhout smelled smoke and managed to douse the flames himself. 

He later told arson investigators that he believed a female client was behind the blaze as an 'interaction' had occurred shortly before.

It's thought the suspect held a grudge against Dr Ousterhout. 

The physician is one of the nation's leading craniofacial
surgeons performing procedures on transgender people.  

'I turn
boys' faces into girls' faces,' he told KNTV News last summer.

Ousterhout, who bought the house in 1997, also said he
was the perfect person to own the house featured in Mrs Doubtfire, which is about a man who disguises himself as an
elderly female nanny.

Police spokesman Albie Esparza said the suspected arsonist's name and charges won't be released until she is formally arrested and booked into jail.
