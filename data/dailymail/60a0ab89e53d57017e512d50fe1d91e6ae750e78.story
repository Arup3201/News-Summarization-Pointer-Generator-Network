The judge said drug-addict Edward Hanratty had 'failed lamentably' as a father after pleading guilty to child neglect. Hanratty also jailed for three years on separate charges of conning a 91-year-old man

A neglectful father who put his 'self-indulgent drugs lifestyle' ahead of his baby son, who died when a television fell on his head, has been jailed today.

Judge Anthony Russell, QC, the Recorder of Preston, told drug addict Edward Hanratty he had 'failed lamentably' as a father.

Hanratty, 41, was passed out on the kitchen floor when the baby's mother Natalie McMilian, 25, knocked over the five-stone television after she had drunk alcohol and taken drugs.

Four-month-old Kian McMillan died from catastrophic head injuries.

He had been laying on a changing mat at the family home in Burnley, Lancashire, when McMillan knocked over the television set as she tried to plug in a scart lead to watch a DVD.

Sentencing Hanratty to 10 months in prison for child neglect, Judge Russell said: 'It was abundantly clear that you and your partner were in no fit state to look after your child that night.

'Over the short life of your child you gave priority to yourself and your self-indulgent drugs lifestyle and neglected the life of Kian.

'You must bear some responsibility for the death because you were the father of Kian.

'You failed lamentably. You should have protected Kian from his mother's neglect.'

Hanratty was also sentenced to three years in prison today for conning a 91-year-old man from Bradford out of his life savings.

In January, his former partner McMillan, from Leeds, was imprisoned for 15 months after she admitted neglect over the death of Kian in December 2011. She was cleared of manslaughter by a jury.

Hanratty, from Bradford, also pleaded guilty to child neglect during the trial after giving his evidence which Judge Russell described as 'a very poor display in the witness box'.

He failed to turn up for the sentencing in January at Preston Crown Court because he said he had no money for his train fare from Bradford.

Hanratty was sentenced today for draining nearly £30,000 from his victim to feed his drug addiction, the court heard.

He had befriended the pensioner 15 years earlier when he randomly knocked on his door and asked  for financial help.

They became friends but as the years went by Hanratty became more persistent in asking for money.

In 2007 he was jailed for 30 months for dishonesty offences in which he duped another elderly victim out of money.

He used that conviction to trick the 
91-year-old out of more money as he lied that he needed to pay hefty 
compensation sums and court costs to save him from more time in jail.

Hanratty even drew up a fake solicitor's letter demanding money when his elderly victim became suspicious.

He was finally caught when a family 
friend of the victim recorded phone calls made by the defendant in which
he asked for money, and passed them on to the police.

Last November Hanratty pleaded guilty at Leeds Crown Court to two counts of fraud.

Judge Russell told him: 'The fraud is a particularly mean offence involving the targeting of a vulnerable elderly man who you had known for some years and had taken pity on you and given you money over a long period of time.

'Preying on the elderly in this way is utterly reprehensible.'

Hanratty received a two-month concurrent sentence for stealing a boy's pedal cycle outside a house in the Bradford area last September.

James Bourne-Arton, defending, said the offence of child neglect was directly as a result of his 'long-standing drug addiction which is clearly the root of all of his offending'.

His addiction had led him into a 'hopeless situation' over the last 10 years, he added.

Recently Hanratty had been the victim of 'a serious assault' at his home following the publicity of the case involving his son's death, said Mr Bourne-Arton.

He suffered a number of broken bones, had boiling water poured on his body and had clumps of his hair removed.

His barrister said his client was planning to take advantage of drug rehabilitation programmes while in custody to address his problems.

Judge Russell told him: 'Unless you do so there is really little hope for your future.'
