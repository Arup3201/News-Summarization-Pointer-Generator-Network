A mobile brothel caught fire in a motorway rest stop while the owner was busy conducting business with a lorry driver in his cab.

Police and around 35 fire fighters were called to the scene after the mobile home burst into flames at the lay-by near Horneburg, Germany.

The female brothel owner parked up at the site as it was a convenient spot for her to offer erotic services to clients.

Unoccupied: 'Lady Jane', the owner of the 'Love-Mobil', was not in the van when it caught alight as she busy conducting business with a lorry driver in his cab

According to the police, these were 
mainly lorry drivers or car drivers who were travelling along the B73 
motorway near the region of Horneburg, southwest of the city of Hamburg 
in Lower Saxony.

The 32-year-old brothel owner known as 'Lady Jane' was fortunately conducting business with a truck driver in his cab when her 'Love-Mobil', which had included a bed and various erotic aids, caught fire.

It took 35 fire fighters to put out the blaze - the cause of which is still unknown.

Police spokesman Markus Dietmar said: 'The cause of the blaze is being investigated. It took 35 firemen to extinguish it after we got the first report at 22:00 hours.

'By the time they arrived, the mobile erotic wagon was already well on fire and it is a total write-off as a result of the blaze.'

He said that the female owner had estimated the cost of replacing the van at more than £5,000.

Police are appealing for witnesses to get in touch if they noticed anything unusual that might indicate how the blaze started and whether it was arson.
