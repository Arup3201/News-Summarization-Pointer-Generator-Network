Premier League's Chief Executive Richard Scudamore is reported to have sent a series of sexist emails

The boss of the Premier League has been forced to apologise after it was revealed he sent a series of crude sexist emails, in which he also mocked 'female irrationality'.

Richard ­Scudamore, who likes to be seen as a champion of equality within the game, exchanged the messages with senior colleagues.

They were revealed by the married 54-year-old's former PA, who received them automatically when she was working for the League last October, the Sunday Mirror reported.

In one message, Scudamore mocked a former girlfriend saying he called her 'double decker' because she was 'happy for you to play upstairs, but her Dad got angry if you went below'.

In another, the father-of-five told a lawyer friend who works on behalf of the Premier League to keep a woman colleague they nicknamed Edna 'off your shaft'.

He also forwarded a 'male fairy tale' joke sent to him from a friend about a prince who was proposed to and said no, then lived happily ever after and 'banged skinny big t****d broads'.

In one sleazy email exchange the lawyer
 bragged to ­Scudamore: 'Have spent all day fending Edna off my graphite
 shaft. She is terribly relentless isn't she?!'

Scudamore, who has been chief of the Premier League since 1999, replied: 'Terribly! 
Must keep her off your shaft... graphite, sausage meat or flimsy 
sponge.'

Scudamore, who lives with his wife Catherine in a £1.8million home in Cirencester, Gloucestershire, has been at the forefront of promoting the growth of women's football and said the league strives to be at 'the leading edge' of the 'whole equality agenda'.

Pensive: Scudamore looks to have things on his mind as he takes his seat at the Etihad

Richard Scudamore, Premier League chief executive, is a married father-of-five who lives in Cirencester, Gloucestershire

He will be at the Etihad Stadium on Sunday in anticipation of Manchester City winning the Premier League for the second time in three seasons.

In a statement issued to MailOnline, he apologised saying sending the emails was an 'error of judgement'.

He said: 'These were private emails exchanged between colleagues and friends of many years.

'They
 were received from and sent to my private and confidential email 
address, which a temporary employee who was with the organisation for 
only a matter of weeks, should not have accessed and was under no 
instruction to do so.

'Nonetheless
 I accept the contents are inappropriate and apologise for any offence 
caused, particularly to the former employee. It was an error of 
judgement that I will not make again.'

Scudamore, 54, has been chief executive of the Premier League since 1999

In November Scudamore announced that the
 Premier League and The Football League were joining forces with Sport England to provide new grassroots 
women's and girls' football sessions for 14 to 25 year olds.

He
 said: 'The aim of this programme is to increase participation in women 
and girls' football, and Premier League clubs are in a unique position 
to do that.

'Not only 
can they attract participants through the power of the badge, but 
critically, they can deliver a quality coaching experience. Clubs will 
be able to build on the success of Premier League 4 Sport, which was a 
trailblazer for Sport England's satellite club strategy, to get more 
individuals than ever playing our national game.'

But following the exposure of his emails, campaigners for equality in sport have hit out at Scudamore.

Kick It Out, the sport's equality and inclusion campaign sponsored by the Premier League, told the Sunday Mirror that ­Scudamore's behaviour was ­unacceptable.

A spokesman said: 'Every employing organisation should have a disciplinary code covering staff conduct, and follow due process at all times when there is an allegation of sexist behaviour.'

Shadow Equalities Minister Gloria de Piero told the paper: 'No one should use deeply offensive language like this. Football is a family game, with many women supporters, players and referees. It's time to kick sexism out of football.'

Conservative MP Tracey Crouch, a ­qualified FA football coach and manager of a girls' youth team, suggested the language he used could damage the women's game.

Ms Crouch said: 'It's disappointing at a time when he's trying to encourage more women to play football that he is using derogatory terminology like this.

'It's a difficult environment for a woman to be involved in, either as a player or an official, and, while most people have thick skins, it's important that somebody who is promoting the women's game shouldn't be using this sort of language.'
