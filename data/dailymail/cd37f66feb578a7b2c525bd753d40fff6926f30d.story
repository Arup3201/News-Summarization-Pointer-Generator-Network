Residents living close to Will Loasby, 30, endured months of torment while he threw loud parties fuelled by drugs

A 'neighbour from hell' has been barred from his own home after months of anti-social behaviour  culminated in a 10 hour rave at his home.

Residents living close to Will Loasby, 30, in Downham Market, Norfolk, endured months of torment while he threw loud parties, a court heard.

They said his music was played so loudly from his semi-detached home that the pictures on the wall of the house next door were shaking.

The nightmare culminated in a 11-hour rave on November 28 when music started blaring from the house at 5.30pm and did not stop until 4am.

Now, in one of the first cases of its kind, the local council has prosecuted Loasby under the new Anti-Social Behaviour, Crime and Policing Act which was passed earlier this year.

Magistrates have granted a closure order on the property, which prevents occupiers and others from remaining there for a maximum of three months.

It means that despite a last minute bid by Loasby, he has been banned from the housing association-owned property for six weeks. The order does not terminate the tenancy but the court was told eviction proceedings are likely to be brought against Loasby.

Emma Duncan, prosecuting, said furious neighbours in Downham Market, Norfolk called police after pictures hanging on their walls began to shake.

When officers turned up to the house they found themselves outnumbered by revellers with around 30 people under the influence of alcohol or drugs.

Loasby pleaded with magistrates to show leniency but at the hearing last Friday he was banned from the housing association-owned property for six weeks.

The prosecution - one of the first cases of its kind in the country - means he cannot got back to his home until January 15.

Ian Cooke, presiding magistrate at King's Lynn, said there was 'no other way' to prevent disorder for neighbours.

Ms Duncan had told the court how Loasby repeatedly refused to turn the music down when asked by neighbours and council officers.

She said: 'The loudness and intensity of the bass beat was described as the loudest the noise nuisance officer had heard in eight years in the job.

'Around 30 people were under the influence of alcohol or drugs, and there was physical contact between rave goers and residents.

'The neighbours are at their wits' end and they deserve some relief from Mr Loasby's behaviour.'

She also warned there was 'not enough' police manpower in the whole of Norfolk to stop the gatherings once they had begun.

The bench was told that police would not be able to support council staff if they tried to seize sound equipment.

Loasby denied use of or selling of drugs but admitted his party got 'out of hand' and said he made a 'massive mistake'.

Representing himself, he said: 'My neighbour asked me to turn the music down in a very aggressive way which annoyed me and I slammed the door in her face.

'I was under the influence of alcohol and the decision I took was a massive mistake.

'You can do what you want. I'm not going to have another party because I don't want to lose my house.'

He added that the house was one of the only remaining connections he had to his daughter who had been previously adopted.

After the hearing, Loasby said he has since been left 'walking the streets'.

He said: 'I am homeless. The only place the council has offered me to live is the biggest drug den in King's Lynn.

'Since I left court on Friday I have been walking the streets. I haven't really slept. I have just being going to warm places.

'I do not have friends and family to help me. I want to apologise to some of my neighbours.'

Speaking about the new rule to evict tenants for up to three months, he said: 'I think it is a joke.

'Maybe for people who are repeat offenders but that was the first time the council had been to my house.' 

Unemployed Loasby said he has been unable to work since he  tripped and banged his head in 2011 and was left in a coma. 

The prosecution was brought by West Norfolk Council and deputy leader Brian Long said: 'A small minority of people can make life miserable for our law-abiding residents.

'In this instance the nature of the disorder and the potential for further disorder has triggered this decisive action.

'In cases such as this it is important that we act swiftly to protect residents in the vicinity of the property.' 

Loasby pleaded with magistrates to show leniency but at the hearing he was banned from the housing association-owned property for six weeks

Sue Stavers, managing director of Circle Housing Wherry, who own the property, said they 'fully supported' the council's action.

She said: 'We work in close partnership and regularly exchange information with local authorities, the police and a range of other agencies to tackle anti-social behaviour.

'Where problems persist and alternative methods have been exhausted, we will go to every length necessary to ensure that those committing anti-social behaviour crimes are brought to justice.' 

Loasby's next door neighbour Greg Dzirnowski said he had to take this young family out in his car to escape the noise.

Mr Dzirnowski, 34, said: 'We've lived in our house for five years and Will moved in two years ago.

'For the past two months it has been very bad but the past three weeks it has been terrible.

'There have been lots of parties but this time it was ridiculous. It was all night.

'Around 10 pictures on my wall fell down and some broke, they were family photos. The whole house was shaking.

'On the Friday evening a van arrived and 10 huge speakers were loaded out of it. There were no lyrics to the music it was just a heavy vibrating beat.

'It got so bad I took my family out in the car to escape it in the hope it would stop when we got back.

'I knocked on his door and asked him to keep the noise down but he was aggressive and said some very very bad words to me then slammed the door in my face. He knows what he's doing isn't alright but he just doesn't care.

'I called the police and they came and did nothing. They asked him to turn it down but when they went away he turned it back up again.

'Cabs were constantly arriving and eventually people went at around 7am.'

Speaking about the recent eviction Mr Dzirnowski said: 'I'm glad they've served him the notice. I hope he doesn't come back. He's the neighbour from hell.' 

Deanie Brock, an unemployed 19 year-old who attended the party, said Loasby held the party after breaking up with his girlfriend.

He said: ''It started with just two of my speakers and a couple of us and we started getting drunk.

'Then we said let's have a house party and got someone with a huge van of speakers to bring them in and we stacked them up.

'We have to move everything away from the walls it was so loud. The cupboard doors were opening and closing on their own.

'There were about 25 people there. There was weed and we had loads of alcohol. We heard there were 16 complaints in all.

'I think Will probably is the neighbour from hell. If I had kids I wouldn't want to live next door to him. But it was worth it. It was one of the best parties I've been to.'  

Chris McGrath, 20, has been a neighbour of Loasby's for six months since moving into his retired grandparents' home while working as a labourer.

He claims his grandfather William McGrath, 65, and grandmother Wendy McGrath, 64, feel driven out of the home they have lived in for ten years because of Loasby.

He said: 'They have been thinking about moving. They feel driven out of their home.

'They've rung the council twice a week every week for months and have had meetings with the council about him.

'We've had beer cans and other rubbish purposely thrown into our garden. I would call him a neighbour from hell. I'm glad the council has finally done something.'
