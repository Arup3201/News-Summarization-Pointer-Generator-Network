Eleven members of the Washington Redskins team ran out into the field for Monday night's preseason game against the Cleveland Browns with their hands up and palms forward.

The ‘Hands up, don't shoot’ gesture was a show of solidarity with the people in Ferguson, Missouri, who are protesting the shooting of 18-year-old Michael Brown.

Brown, an unarmed black teenager, was shot dead in Ferguson, Missouri, on August 9 by a white police officer.

The idea to show solidarity for the dead  came from safety Brandon Meriweather and cornerback DeAngelo Hall.

Meriweather said the team's defensive backs decided as a group to pay a pregame tribute as they came through the tunnel and onto FedEx Field.

‘We just want to show our supporters what’s going on in St. Louis,’ Meriweather told WNEW.

‘That could have been any one of us,’ said Safety Ryan Clark. 

‘That could have been any one of our brothers, our cousins. ...When you get an opportunity to make a statement and be more than a football player, it's good.’

The Redskins defeated the Browns 24-23.

Protesters have gathered daily in Ferguson since Brown was fatally was shot on August 9. 

Police say Brown struggled with the officer before being shot six times, but witnesses have said he was not aggressive toward the officer and had his hands raised above his head before he was shot. 

As a result, the words 'hands up, don’t shoot' have become a rallying cry of protesters, both in Ferguson and online.

Monday night saw a ninth evening of protests and disturbances in the town. A St. Louis County spokeswoman says 57 people were booked at the county jail.

Just four of the 57 arrested had Ferguson addresses. Fifty-four were cited for failure to disperse, two for unlawful use of a weapon, and one for interfering with an officer.

Sixteen of those arrested are from out of state.
