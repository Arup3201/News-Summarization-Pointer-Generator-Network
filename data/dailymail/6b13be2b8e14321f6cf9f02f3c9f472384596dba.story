It's luxury living right on the water's edge.

Bespoke barges are now being offered for sale and they're far from the poky, low-ceilinged vessels you might expect.

An artist's impression of the barges, which take 10 months to complete and are split over two levels, shows a fully stocked bar, fireplace, fitted kitchen and terraced deck.

Bespoke barges, pictured above, which allow purchasers to completely customise their interiors are being offered for sale for £1.5 million

The empty shell provides the equivalent of an individual floating loft-type space, suitable for all kinds of interior layouts and styles, according to OnTheMarket.com which is presenting the boats to the market

Purchases of the boats have complete freedom to design their own interiors. The empty shell provides the equivalent of an individual floating loft-type space, suitable for all kinds of interior layouts and styles, according to OnTheMarket.com which is listing them for sale.

The barges will be moored at Oyster Pier, just minutes away from Chelsea and Kensington. A maximum of 10 vessels will be kept at the site along with the Piermaster's boat.

The boats will be independently navigable and will cost £1.5m for a basic fit-out and mooring. Barges with a builders' finish start at £900,000. Moorings can be sold separately. 

The vessels will have a renewable, approximately 115 year lease.

Helen Whiteley, Commercial Director at OnTheMarket.com,urged those interested in the barges to 'enquire quickly' as she expects them to be snapped up. 

In February last year a rare 'Oxford Barge' that dated back to the 19th Century went on sale for £150,000. 

The barge comprised of two double bedrooms, two bathrooms, an open plan lounge and a fully fitted kitchen. 

A decked bow platform and ballustraded roof terrace - once used to watch rowing races - provided views of the river.

The previous year, what was then said to be Britain's most extravagant house boat, was offered for sale for £250,000.

The 85ft Dutch abode came complete with a modern fitted kitchen, sitting room with vaulted ceilings and a Victorian-style bathroom.

It also had three bedrooms and a rare permanent mooring spot, with running water, central heating and electricity, making it the height of luxury compared to most other houseboats.
