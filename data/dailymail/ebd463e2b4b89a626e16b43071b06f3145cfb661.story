A Siberian boy has formed a touching friendship with a wild sparrow after nursing it back to health.

Vadim Veligurov, 12, from the town of of Dudinka, the administrative capital of the Taymyr Peninsula in northern Russia, found abandoned Abi just after she hatched.

He brought the lost female baby bird to his grandmother's house in Minusinsk, some 264 miles south of Russia's Siberian city of Krasnoyarsk, where he was spending the summer vacation.

Rest: Abi places her head on the boy's shoulder. He rescued her soon after she hatched and the two are now best friends

He fed and nurtured the little bird but when the sad day came to set it free, Abi decided to stay with the boy instead of fly away. The pair are now inseperable.

Abi now spends most of her time with Vadim, who treats the bird as his friend and plans to take it with him when he returns to his native town.

She will happily sit on the boy's shoulder and is completely comfortable eating out of his hands, reports Radio Sarajevo.

The charming situation echoes that of a four-year-old boy who has no human friends of his own who formed an incredible bond with a gibbon

Putra the tailless-ape is the best mate of little Deo Saputra, who lives on Indonesia's Bintan Island.

Local photographer Andri Mediansyah, 34, found the ape-human best friends by accident as he drove past their house.

'Deo and Putra have lived together since they were babies,' said Andri.

'It is astonishing to see a four-year-old boy so close to an animal that is cute - but also very strong with powerful jaws.'
