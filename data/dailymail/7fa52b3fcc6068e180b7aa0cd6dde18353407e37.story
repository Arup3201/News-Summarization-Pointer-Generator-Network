A zoo held a hilarious competition to decide whether its male raccoon or his female companion was best at washing clothes – and the fairer sex won.

The animals are famous for cleaning their food but the aim was to go one step further.

A video of the stunt at Krasnoyarsk Zoo in Russia shows that ‘washing is definitely woman’s work’, reported The Siberian Times.

Compared: Artem (right), the male raccoon, 'was full of determination to complete the task' and Masha (left) 'tried to get him out of the wash bowl by constantly biting his ears'

Gnawed at the buttons: Artem patiently ignored the harassment, trying to keep his place at the washing tub

Washing: A triumphant Masha was left to continue on her own. She added water, sand and pebbles to help the cleaning process

‘Artem, the male raccoon, was full of determination to complete the task, but in the end was disqualified for eating the buttons of the clothes.

‘Masha somehow knew this was women’s work and tried to get him out of the wash bowl by constantly biting his ears.’

Artem patiently ignored the harassment, trying to keep his place at the washing tub. Eventually he was forced to take a rag out of the bowl but then upset the judges by gnawing at the buttons.

He was returned to his cage in disgrace, said reports of the bizarre contest to mark Raccoon Day on August 9.

This left a triumphant Masha to continue on her own. She added water, sand and pebbles to help the cleaning process.

Keeper
 Ekaterina Mikhailiva explained: ‘Raccoons in their natural environment 
rinse in water everything that comes into their paws.

‘In
 the zoo they wash in the bowl even cottage cheese and buckwheat. So we 
decided to hold a little competition between our raccoons Masha and 
Artem.’
