This is the moment a driver undertook a lorry on the hard shoulder, before swerving across two lanes and braking in front of another car.

Christian Clark, 27, from Leeds, was caught on camera undertaking a white lorry on the hard shoulder of the A1 in Richmond, North Yorkshire.

He then cut in front of the vehicle and swerved into the fast lane, where he slammed on his brakes just metres away from another car.
