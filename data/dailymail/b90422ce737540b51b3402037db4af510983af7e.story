It remains the worst maritime tragedy in US history, and cost more lives than the sinking of the Titanic, but the Sultana disaster is a story history has largely forgotten.

In April 1865, at least 1,700 people, mostly Union soldiers returning home after the end of the Civil War, lost their lives when the riverboat exploded on the Mississippi.

Captain J.C.Mason had allowed the Sultana to become dangerously overloaded with passengers - it was carrying six times its capacity of 376 - and the vast majority of helpless victims either suffocated, burned or drowned.

One of the Sultana's steam boilers exploded, tearing the vessel in two and sending victims plunging into the icy water

The side-wheeler boat had been built for transporting cotton - but had been adapted to carry people and Captain Mason was encouraged to pick up Union soldiers trying to get home by the offer of $5 for each enlisted man and $10 for each officer.

Captain J.C. Mason was encouraged to take on more passengers because the U.S government was paying him for each soldier and officer he brought home

He left New Orleans with around 100 passengers and headed north but each time he stopped more and more soldiers would get on.

Many had spent months or years in prisoner camps and were desperate to get home.

At one point the ship had to stay docked for several days while one of steam boilers was repaired which allowed even more passengers to get on.

When an Army officer raised his concerns, Captain Mason assured him that the Sultana was more than capable of carrying the load.

'Take good care of those men,' the officer told him. 'They are deserving of it.'

Despite being packed in like sardines, the soldiers spirits were high and they were singing songs and telling war stories.

But after leaving Memphis, the extra load finally took its toll.

At around 2am on April 26, one of the steam boilers exploded quickly followed by the other two.

The enormous blast split the ship in two firing burning hot coals out like bullets.

Victims were pitched out into the icy water while others suffocated or burned.

The Sultana was carrying six times as many passengers than its maximum capacity when it sank in 1865

Newspaper reports of the tragedy were relegated to the back pages because of the end of the Civil War

One survivor described it like this: 'The whole heavens seemed to be lighted up by the conflagration. Hundreds of my comrades were fastened down by the timbers of the decks and had to burn while the water seemed to be one solid mass of human beings struggling with the waves.'

Of an estimated 2,300 people - at least 1,700 lost their lives that night, including Captain Mason.

But the Sultana disaster remains a largely unknown part of U.S. history.

In the aftermath of such a bloody war, the nation was largely densensitised to death and newspapers were instead full of reports about the end of the war, the new presidency and rebuilding.

There was also a degree of embarrassment on the part the Army in light of the poor decisions made by officers and the ship's captain.

But the bow of the Sultana remains at the muddy bottom of the Mississippi River as a sad memorial to the men who never made it home.

The story of the Sultana has been retold inÂ Uncle John's Unstoppable Bathroom Reader.
