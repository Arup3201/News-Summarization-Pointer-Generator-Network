In a emotional 15th birthday message to her daughter Abigail, Zenya Hernandez begged for the schoolgirl to come home

The last call made on a missing New Hampshire girl’s cellphone was last Wednesday about four hours after she was last seen, investigators said on Sunday.

Abigail Hernandez, 15, of North Conway was last seen leaving Kennett High School on Wednesday afternoon.

Police say she made it home but was gone when her mother arrived later.

Police said they have not located the girl’s phone but have determined that the last call was made at 6.30pm.

It was used about two miles from her home at a spot near Cranmore Mountain, a ski resort popular with tourists.

Several agencies, including the FBI, have been involved in searching for the girl by land, water and air.

The mother of the missing 15-year-old pleaded for her daughter's safe return on Sunday, saying: 'Please come home. We miss you so badly.'

Speaking in front of Conway police station on Sunday, Zenya Hernandez wished her daughter Abigail a happy birthday.

Kieran Ramsey, from the FBI, confirmed today that teams are continuing their searches using five sniffer dog teams.

Officers are also canvassing and chasing up tip-offs from the public, though no new information has come to light.

Abigail, a Kennett High School student, has been missing since Wednesday last week after walking home from class.

The last sighting of the girl, who ran on
the track team for her school and was described as quiet and bright, 
was around 2.30pm.

Investigators believe Abigail made it back to her home, but when her mother came back from her nursing job, her daughter was gone.

The schoolgirl's 15th birthday was on Saturday.

Since then local police and the FBI have searched on foot, in boats, and by helicopter but have failed to turn up any new evidence about the disappearance.

FBI fixed-wing planes have been 
drafted into the search, and on Saturday lines of officials meticulously
searched four square miles of woodland.

Despite
searching over 3,000 acres Major Kevin Jordan of the Maine Fish and 
Game Department, said: 'We are nowhere near done. We are here to find 
Abi and to bring her home.'

Five specially trained teams of sniffer dogs were also used, but so far to no avail.

The search has been so thorough that officers have found the body of a hiker who went missing over the weekend, and bone fragments from another case, possibly that of a hiker who went missing in 2006.

Both sets of evidence are unrelated to the Hernandez case.

New Hampshire's White Mountains are full of tourists at this time of year as they come to take pictures of the leaves changing in autumn.

Police, FBI, New Hampshire Fish and Game personnel and volunteers have all helped to search for the teenager but have not found any leads

This weekend the holidaymakers were handed flyers of the pretty girl and told to watch for anything suspicious.

Hernandez's picture was also plastered over store windows in North Conway Village and in the popular shopping mall.

Police officials said they are still treating Hernandez's disappearance as a missing persons case, but added that foul play has not been ruled out.

So far officers say they have received over 200 tip-offs, some from as far away as Texas.

Abigail is 5ft 4in tall and weighs 118lb with
brown hair and eyes. She was last seen wearing black stretch pants, 
tall brown boots and a grey sweater.

Anyone with information is asked to contact Conway police on 603-356-5715.
