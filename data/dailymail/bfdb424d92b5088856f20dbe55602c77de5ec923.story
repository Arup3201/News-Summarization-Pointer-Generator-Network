Jose Mourinho has dubbed Paris Saint-Germain the 'most aggressive' team Chelsea has played this season, including a cup encounter with Shrewsbury from League Two.

Mourinho claimed the most surprising aspect of the first leg in the Parc des Princes which ended 1-1 was that the French champions had not tried to play more football.

'I was surprised in that game,' said the Chelsea boss, ahead of the return at Stamford Bridge on Wednesday. 'I was surprised because a team with fantastic players was the team with a record number of fouls.

'That it was the team making foul after foul, was the team which stopped Eden Hazard with fouls all the time, was the team attacking the man in possession of the ball with two or three players with some very aggressive actions, a team where – even a player like Zlatan (Ibrahimovic), a typical attacking player – came back when they lost the ball and attacked Hazard from behind when we were countering.

'I thought an English team would never be surprised by aggression, because aggression we have in our country. This season we've played against sides form the Championship in the cups, against teams from League One, and Shrewsbury from League Two, but the most aggressive team was PSG.

'For me, that was a real surprise. With players of such quality, I was expecting more football and less aggression.'

Chelsea have played Shrewsbury, Bradford City, Derby, Bolton Wanderers and Watford from the Football League this season.

Mourinho was clearly irritated, not only by the physical attention on Hazard, but also by claims from PSG manager Laurent Blanc that Chelsea had been dominated in France.

'It depends upon your concept of football,' said Mourinho. 'What is domination? If that means chances, then yes. If that means making foul after foul, then they dominated. If moving the ball with aggression, yes they dominated. So they dominated in everything except the result.'  

Meanwhile, Mourinho insisted Chelsea have not devised a special plan to contain Ibrahimovic, insisting he is focused on the whole team.

Sweden international Ibrahimovic is Laurent Blanc's side's main threat but Mourinho insists Chelsea cannot focus solely on the talismanic forward.

'I don't have a plan for him as he's very difficult to play against,' the Portuguese told reporters. 'He's such a good player but we're focused on the team.

'This is what we're going to do. We know Zlatan is a fantastic one. We're going to focus on the team and ourselves.'
