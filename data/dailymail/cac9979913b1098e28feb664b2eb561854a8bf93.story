Just because barbecued meat is blackened does not mean it is cooked properly, the Food Standards Agency has warned

If you’re getting ready to have your last barbecue of the summer this bank holiday, you may need your oven turned on too.

A government agency is warning that food should be cooked in the oven and then finished up on the BBQ to help prevent food poisioning.

The Food Standards Agency said cooks are making their guests ill by charring meat on the barbecue but not cooking it all the way through.

The agency said the number of food poisoning cases has doubled over the summer.

A survey found 94 per cent of barbecuers had at least one habit that risked the health of their guests – such as undercooking raw meat or cross contaminating food by leaving cooked and raw meat together.

One in five people has become ill as a result of the food being under-cooked or because of the chef’s bad habits.

Just because food is blackened does not mean it is cooked and the agency are warning to check the meat is cooked all the way through and be aware that disposable BBQs take much longer to cook food properly.

The agency has released a list of warnings to help prevent a fun BBQ being overshadowed by a bout of sickness ahead of the bank holiday weekend.

It says one of the biggest causes of food poisoning is cross contamination in the kitchen.

The agency is warning cooks to store raw and cooked meat separately in your fridge and to use separate utensils when handling the food.

Many people wash chicken before they cook it, but the Food Standards Agency says not to, as it just spreads germs around the kitchen.

It also warns: ‘You may have heard of salmonella and E.coli, which are well known causes of food poisoning, but you may not be aware that at least 65% of chicken sold in the UK contains a bug called campylobacter.

‘Campylobacter poisoning can lead to sickness, diarrhoea, disability and even worse. Those most at risk are children and older people. If you want your barbecue to be remembered for the right reasons, follow the FSA’s advice on beating the barbecue bugs.’

Advising pre-cooking for chicken, the advice reads: ‘Your friends and family will still experience that special barbecue ‘scorched’ taste – and you will know that you’ve cooked the chicken all the way through. This technique can also be used for sausages, burgers and kebabs if you’re cooking for large numbers, as you’ll want to avoid providing undercooked food.’
