Tragic: Young mother Dawn Graves was declared dead at the scene in Bolton yesterday, where she was hit by a lorry

A young mother has died after being hit by a lorry while she pushed her 20-month-old son across a road in his pram.

Dawn Graves had gone to the shops for a pint of milk in Bolton, Greater Manchester, with her toddler son when she was hit.

The 25-year-old was said to have died after trying to hurl her son's pushchair out of the path of the recycling truck yesterday lunchtime.

Horrified witnesses said Ms Graves crossed the road after emerging from the shop, only to be hit by the truck as it turned a corner.

Jordan Kay-Haworth, 19, who works at a nearby barbers, said: 'She just started crossing. It went right over her. 

'I think the buggy got hit first - she must have got dragged under. There was lots of blood.' 

Ms Graves's son Aidan suffered minor and was taken to hospital but has since been released.

Mr Kay-Haworth added: 'The baby didn't cry at all.

'It's a miracle he wasn't hurt. The buggy had flipped over and I could see the toddler's legs dangling in the air.'

Paramedics tried to save Ms Graves, believed to be a mother-of-two, but she was pronounced dead at the scene.

She is thought to have been engaged to Aidan’s father, Barry Guest, who was unaware of the tragedy until he returned home a few hours later.

Residents described the accident scene as a 'dangerous corner' and called for the side road into which the truck was turning to be blocked off and made pedestrian-only.

Sgt Matt Bailey-Smith, of Greater Manchester Police, said: 'This is a tragic incident and our thoughts are with the family and friends at this difficult time. They are receiving support from a specially trained officer.

'An investigation is underway and I ask anyone who may have witnessed the collision or have information to contact us.'
