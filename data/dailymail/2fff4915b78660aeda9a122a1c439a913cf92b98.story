Bombed to pieces in a raid which could have come straight out of the film Top Gun, it was a stark symbol of Saddam Hussein's rule over Iraq having been broken and destroyed.

The Al Mansur, translated as ‘The Victor’, was the dictator’s £25million yacht which was blasted during the Iraq War in March 2003 - and 10 years on it is still a stark reminder of a fallen tyrant.

The 400ft boat, weighing 7,400 tons, could seat 200 guests under a glass atrium in the middle and even had a secret escape route descending down from Hussein’s room into a submarine launch pod.

It was designed to Saddam's personal specifications and sumptuously decorated all over in marble, exotic woods, and with silver and gold fittings.

Measuring 350ft long, the boat weighed 7,359 tons and looked more like a smart cross-Channel ferry than a private yacht.

Saddam's love for al-Mansur was proved just five days before the war began.

Despite all the other urgent war preparations, he had ordered the yacht 
to be moved under a full naval guard from its normal berth in the far 
southern port of Umm Qasr to Basra's inner harbour in a vain attempt to 
offer it better
protection.

But it was blown up in Basra harbour 
by 500lb Mark 82 bombs during the Anglo-American invasion by two VF-2s 
with TARPS (Tactical Airborne Reconnaissance Pod System) from USS 
Constellation.

These ‘Bounty Hunter’ F-14 Tomcats 
attacked the yacht on March 27, 2003, more than 20 years after it had 
been launched in 1982. It had escaped damage during the Iran-Iraq War of
1980 to 1988.

The F-14s were flying near the 
Euphrates River for a standard TARPS reconnaissance mission when a 
British Army forward air controller asked them to attack the yacht, 
reported The Aviationist blog.

The
Combined Air Operations Center had realised that radio equipment on the
ship was being used for battlefield communication, although the vessel 
had never been used for military purposes before.

The ship had already been hit by a 
shot from an S-3B Viking - a primarily anti-submarine plane - but it was
missed by two laser-guided bombs from F/A-18 Hornets, reported The 
Aviationist.

However, on March 27 the attack was led by a Tomcat team of Lt Mark Callari and Lt Jeff Sims, which dropped two bomb runs while Lt Pat Baker and Lt Sean Mathieson provided cover in the second F-14 above.

They then switched positions and Baker and Mathienson dropped their bombs, hitting the hull above the water. Both planes headed back to the Constellation with the Al Mansur on fire.

The team knew their attacks had not sunk the vessel. The bombs were designed with fuses intended for ground support, but not for sinking the ship - because they exploded before hitting.

But the Al Mansur was rendered unusable by the bombs and was decommissioned almost three months later before being scrapped at Basra in 2005.

In 2009 the boat's sister ship which was also built in secret for the Iraqi dictator went on sale for £17million.

Decor aboard the floating palace - originally called Qadissivat
Saddam - included Arabesque arches, dark wood carvings, deep pile
carpets, and loose rugs woven in Islam's holiest cities.

As well as other typically Muslim features, including prayer
rooms and ornate fountains, the Danish builders also installed
gold-tap bathrooms, whirl pools, steam rooms, and hi-tech
bathrooms.

Unlike the Al Mansur, the Qadissivat Saddam was kept abroad after it was built in
Denmark in 1981 and was completely untouched by the
numerous wars Saddam was involved in during his reign.

Al Mansur (712 to 775) was the second caliph of the Abbasid dynasty and is generally regarded as the real founder of the Abbasid caliphate.

His father was a great-grandson of Mohammed's uncle Abbas.

Al Mansur wiped out the last remnants of the deposed Omayyad dynasty, and cut the Abbasids free from the revolutionary movement that had brought them to power.

He achieved power with the aid of Persian troops, and he established his new capital at Baghdad.

Arab historian Al Masudi in Meadows of Gold recounts a number of anecdotes that present aspects of this caliph's character.

He tells of a blind poet on two occasions reciting praise poems for the Umayyads to one he didn't realize was this Abbasid caliph. Al Mansur rewarded the poet for the verses.

Al Masudi relates a tale of the arrow with verses inscribed on feathers and shaft arriving close to Al Mansur. These verses prompted him to investigate the situation of a notable from Hamadan unjustly imprisoned and release him.

There is also the account of the foreboding verses Al Mansur saw written on the wall just before his death.

A very impressive aspect of this caliph's character is that when he died he left in the treasury six hundred thousand dirhams and fourteen million dinars.

In 2008, MBC 1 had depicted the life and leadership of Al Mansur in a historical series aired during the holy month of Ramadan.
