With the return of the Premier League this weekend, fans around the country got a chance to see their new signings in action for the first time.

Whether they were playing their first game in English football or returning to their former club to play for a new side, the debutants carried a weight of expectation into the opening day of the season.

From first goals to early injuries, Sportsmail's reporters pass their judgement on the new signings.

Arsenal

By Jack Gaughan

Mathieu Debuchy - The Frenchman was slow to get forward down the right for the Gunners. Needs time to show what he can do in an Arsenal shirt to minimise the damage from Bacary Sagna’s move away.

Slow start: Mathieu Debuchy was solid enough defensively but didn't offer Arsenal enough going forward

More to come: Alexis Sanchez did little to justify his price-tag on debut, but there is plenty of time to improve

Calum Chambers - Picked up a silly booking for hauling Fraizer Campbell down, but a solid and composed debut. Doesn’t look overawed whatsoever.

Alexis Sanchez - A case of trying too hard, Sanchez looked bright but very little came off and the Chilean needs to play centrally. Excellent clipped delivery for Laurent Koscielny’s equaliser.

Aston Villa 

By Joe Bernstein

Aly Cissokho – Played better than anything he showed during his loan spell at Liverpool last season.

Philippe Senderos – He always looks ungainly but the Swiss defender did stop a goal by clearing up after Brad Guzan’s spill from Phil Bardsley.

Kieran Richardson – The pick of the Villa debutants. Thrived in a central role and set up an easy chance for Gabriel Agbonlahor that was fluffed.

Impressive: Cissoko looked assured at left back, which will calm the nerves of Villa fans who saw him last year

Excellent: Kieran Richardson put in an impressive display on debut for Villa, running hard and creating chances

Crystal Palace  

By Jack Gaughan

Martin Kelly - Didn’t have a man to mark directly but kept his concentration and marauded down the right with purpose.

Brede Hangeland - Classy glanced header put Palace ahead, but he was then guilty of losing Koscielny for the equaliser.

Rising high: Hangeland escapes Koscielny to head in Palace's goal but he lost the same man for the equaliser

Fraizer Campbell - Found himself isolated on occasion, but did well to hold the ball up in tricky circumstances and it was important that the visitors had a focal point.

Hull City  

By Sami Mokbel

Drifter: Tom Ince showed flashes of his undoubted talent but will need to get into games more 

Andrew Robertson - Looks a shrewd acquisition by Steve Bruce. Patrolled the left side with boundless energy.

Robert Snodgrass - Fitted comfortably into midfield for Hull before a knee injury forced him off in the 40th minute.

Tom Ince - Drifted in and out of the game. A lot more to come from the talented youngster.

Leicester City 

By Nick Harris

Leanardo Ulloa - Leicester paid a club £8m for the Argentinian striker and he notched a debut Premier League goal  to start repaying it. Promising.

Joy: Ulloa scored 22 minutes into his Leicester career as he looks to pay back their significant investment

Liverpool

By Dominic King

Dejan Lovren - Some fine cross field passing, a few thumping challenges but also some less refined moments of play. Brendan Rodgers called him excellent.

Javier Manquillo - Could have found things difficult after he was booked early on but the right-back defended well and showed enough good moments going forward for a satisfying debut.

Rickie Lambert - Came on as a late substitute and his presence appeared to unsettle Southampton’s defence, leading to Liverpool’s winning goal.

Assured: Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers described Dejan Lovren's as excellent following Sunday's win

Presence: Rickie Lambert came on from the bench and unsettled the Southampton backline at Anfield

VIDEO New signings excellent - Rogers

Manchester United 

By Rob Draper

Tyler Blackett - No better, no worse than his more experienced colleagues but in truth the United defence looked as vulnerable as ever and a centre half must be their top priority in the transfer market. Booked on 83 minutes.

Jesse Lingard - Desperately disappointing: a bruising encounter with Ashley Williams ended his debut after just 24 minutes.

Not out of place: Blackett looked no worse than his fellow defenders but United were shaky at the back

A cut above: Despite a lack of movement around him Herrera made a good impression on his United debut

Ander Herrera - Passes the ball beautifully and looks an improvement to United’s midfield. The problem was there was so little dynamism about his team-mates, so it was hard to judge just how effective he might be long term.

Queens Park Rangers 

By Sami Mokbel

Steven Caulker - Promising debut from the centre back. No reason why he can’t break back into the England fold.

Rio Ferdinand - Deployed as a sweeper in QPR’s new-look 3-5-2 system, but marking let him down for Hull opener.

Sweeping up: Rio Ferdinand had a pivotal role in Harry Redknapp's defensive system, but it did not go to plan

At fault: Ferdinand allows Hull's James Chester to escape him and head in the game's only goal

Jordon Mutch - Showed brilliant energy in the Rangers midfield. Looks to be an excellent signing by Redknapp.

Southampton

By Dominic King

Fraser Forster - Beaten twice but could do nothing about either goal. Never had a shot to save. When he had to handle, he did so with confidence.

Ryan Bertrand - Got up and down the left flank with great frequency, he and Southampton will benefit from him playing regular games.

Head over heels: Fraser Forster gave a confident display in the Southampton goal against Liverpool

Graziano Pelle - Found everything happening a bit too quickly and never had enjoy from Lovren and Martin Skrtel.

Dusan Tadic - A threat from early on, passed the ball well and created chances most notably when his sweet back heel sent Nathaniel Clyne through for the equaliser.

Shane Long - Could have been a hero on his debut but somehow managed to head wide when the goal was at his mercy following Schneiderlin’s shot.

Horror miss: New Saints striker Shane Long holds his head in his hands after heading wide from close range

Stoke City  

By Joe Bernstein

Phil Bardsley – Dependable, as you’d expect the ex-Sunderland full-back to be. Had one shot parried by Guzan.

Bojan Krkic – Pleasing on the eye with his quick feet but not enough end product.

Biram Mame Diouf – Ran hard and fast but didn’t get in the penalty area often enough for a centre forward.

Robust: Bardsley made, as expected, a solid start to life at Stoke City, and should suit them

Potential: Ex-Barcelona striker Bojan has bags of potential but needs to find a bit more cutting edge

Sunderland  

By Craig Hope

Patrick van Aanholt – Combative and energetic, the Dutch left back slotted straight in to the Sunderland backline and laid on Seb Larsson's late equaliser. He looks an assured addition.

Jack Rodwell – He's only played seven Premier League games in two years and Manchester City and it showed. He was off the pace and subdued and it came as no surprise when he was replaced in the second half.

Off the pace: Jack Rodwell needs regular game time if he is to recapture the form that led Man City to sign him

Swansea City 

By Rob Draper

Lukasz Fabianski - Looked solid enough. No sign of the ‘flappy hands’ that earned him his Arsenal nickname. Made some good saves and seems like a decent addition.

Jefferson Montero - Only had 25 minutes but provided the key cross which led to Swansea’s second goal. Showed good pace. As such, the Ecuadorian appears to be unfazed by the initial transition to the Premier League.

Impact: Gylfi Sigurdsson, on his return to the Swansea team, smashed home the winner at Old Trafford

Bright start: Despite only being on the pitch for a short while Bafetimbi Gomis showed encouraging signs

Bafetimbi Gomis - Only had 13 minutes, but holds the ball up really well and almost combined with Sigurdsson to create a third, only Phil Jones crunching challenge saving the day for United.

Gylfi Sigurdsson - Not a debut as such, but a return to Swansea. And he has been missed. Given free rein behind the striker, Sigurdsson is a good player and on Saturday he excelled in the space he was granted.

Tottenham 

By Matt Barlow 

Eric Dier - What a way to endear yourself to Spurs fans, with a coolly taken last-minute winner at West Ham. Dier started at centre half and switch to right back after Spurs were reduced to 10 men after 30 minutes. He looked composed in both positons.

Dream debut: Eric Dier rounds Adrian to score the stoppage time winner for Spurs at Upton Park

Love at first sight: The goal, along with Dier's solid defense display, will have pleased the Spurs fans

West Brom 

By Craig Hope

Andre Wisdom – Suspect in possession on occasions but athletic nonetheless and kept Adam Johnson quiet.

Craig Gardner – Came close to a debut goal against his former club and was typically busy and involved throughout. He provided the cross for his side's second goal and could prove a shrewd acquisition.

Sebastien Pocognoli – He's got a thunderous left boot and that showed on the occasions he did take aim at Sunderland's goal. He looks ready-made for the Premier League. 

West Ham

By Matt Barlow 

Aaron Cresswell - Solid at left back and not intimidated on his Premier League debut after a summer move from Ipswich. Defended well early on and made good decisions on when and where to join the attack. Could not stop Eric Dier scoring the late winner.

Promising start: Cresswell defended well after making the step up from the Championship 

Chiekhou Kouyate - Senegal midfielder from Belgian football. Athletic, strong and full of running. Diving header fizzed wide in the first half. Less influential after the break. Booked.
