Britain's newest lottery millionaire picked up his cheque today and revealed plans to splash out and treat his wife to a new - kitchen sink.

Grandfather-of-nine John Baxter, 63, also says the first thing he bought after realising he'd won £1,000,000 was a £9.99 pair of slippers from Tesco.

Mr Baxter won the massive amount on the EuroMillions raffle draw with a winning ticket he admits he nearly threw away.

Happy: John Baxter, 63 and wife, Carol, 64, celebrate their £1,000,000 Millionaire Raffle on the EuroMillions draw today

He has now vowed to buy his wife Carol, 64, the stainless steel kitchen sink she 'has always wanted'.

Despite their great wealth and opportunities for foreign travel the couple say they will also enjoy their usual holiday - to Great Yarmouth.

Mr Baxter, of Baldock, Hertfordshire, says he won't give up work and the couple are refusing to move house - because it has taken them so long to get it the way they want it.

Lucky John, who works at Luton Airport, joked he might make his next buy a pair of trousers after turning up at the cheque handover - in shorts.

He said: 'I went to the shop to buy my lottery tickets for the week which I have always done on a Friday.

'And I took the ticket from the week before to see if I had won anything - the honest truth is I nearly threw it away - but I took it down with me anyway.

'Gary, who works behind the counter, said 'oh Camelot has said you have to call them'. I thought it was a wind up.

'It's been madness we've had close friends and family in our house celebrating ever since. Its only just sinking in.

'I just couldn't sleep, I was guarding the ticket worried someone may come and pinch it.

'I went to the supermarket and splashed out a tenner on new slippers, I couldn't think of anything else I really needed.

'We are a very close family and exceptionally down to earth people - we won't let this go to our heads.

'I have worked hard my whole life and no intention to retire just because I have won the lottery.

'I have a couple of years left until my retirement, the airport were very good to me 11 years ago when I was unwell and supported me.

'I wouldn't want to leave them in the lurch and I want to do right by them too - I'm a bit of a joker, they still don't quite believe it's true.'

Wealthy: Mr Baxter has now vowed to buy his wife the stainless steel kitchen sink she 'has always wanted'

Father-of-three sons Mr Baxter didn't realise he was a millionaire winner until he decided to take an evening stroll to his local newsagents on Friday.

While purchasing his tickets for the EuroMillions draw, he casually asked the shop keeper to check his ticket from the previous Tuesday.

The stunned cashier at Basra's Store in Baldock, Herts., told technical services worker Mr Baxter he needed to call Camelot 'urgently'.

He headed home to his wife and made the call to lottery organisers, who confirmed he had netted the seven figure prize.

Mr Baxter said he was so stunned by the win he claimed he didn't sleep at all for 24-hours and has only bought himself a pair of slippers.

Retired funeral arranger Mrs Baxter said money 'can't buy health or happiness' but they have always been happy with their lot - and will now treat themselves to a holiday.

She said: 'We could go and see whales which is something I've always wanted to do - but I think I'm a bit too old now.

'I'm happy with a holiday in Great Yarmouth and we will continue to have day trips and holidays there too.

'It may be a lot of money but it won't change what we like.

'We won't be moving because we have finally got our house just how we want it and it's our home.

'Money doesn't buy happiness and we are very happy just as we are, this is just incredible luck which we hope to share with our family.'

Wahey! Mr Baxter won the massive amount on the EuroMillions raffle draw with a winning ticket he admits he nearly threw away

Mr Baxter, originally from Stevenage, met his wife in 1967 in a working men's club and they have now been married 45 years.

He said: 'That was in the days of mods and rockers, I was a rocker and she was a mod. I was near the bar and she stood on my toe and didn't apologise.

'We started dating and married a few months later. Our family is our world and we couldn't be luckier.'

Despite failing health and triple heart bypass a 11 years ago, Mr Baxter considers himself very lucky.

He and his wife plan to make a sizeable donation to The Meningitis Trust of whom they are big supporters.

Mr Baxter, who is known by friends as the practical joker, added: 'We nearly lost our granddaughter Kimberley to meningitis when she was very young.

'Now she is 19 and here with us we are more than grateful for the charities support and our world wouldn't be the same with out her.

'We want to help other families but we don't wish disclose how much we plan to give at this point.'

The couple today claimed they plan to continue buying their weekly ticket.
