England have launched their own official Instagram as their World Cup preparations well and truly click into full gear.

The account will track the squad's movements and moments throughout their journey in Brazil, from their training base in Rio to their final group game against Costa Rica - and hopefully beyond.

And they have already got into full swing, with snaps of the famous Three Lions badge, the inside of their boot room, some training shots and a video of the welcoming they received upon arrival.

The boot room: It will track England's preparations and movements during the World Cup

England arrived in Brazil on Sunday, 
after flying in from Miami following their goalless draw against 
Honduras in their final warm-up game.

They are set to stay in Rio until Thursday, before they fly north to Manaus, where their World Cup campaign will get underway against Italy on Saturday.

The move follows several England squad members such as Steven Gerrard, Phil Jagielka and Jack Wilshere joining the social networking site.
