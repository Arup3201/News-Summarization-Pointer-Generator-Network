Philip Hughes’ death was possibly the saddest day in Australian cricket history, but despite the millions of tears shed by the game’s fans the world over, the spirit of the man still remained among those who knew him best.

The fact is that Hughes will live on forever in the hearts of those he left behind. Over the last few days many of those had gathered in Sydney from all over the country to show support for his family and friends.

On Thursday night the same people met at the Sydney Cricket Ground to reflect on Philip’s life and the impact that he had on theirs. It was a sad and quiet occasion, but also a memorable one.

Everything that happened in the past few days was tragic but this was the chance to tell some great stories about Hughes the fun-loving joker. 

Described as 'the cheeky little boy that came down from Macksville' by Cricket Australia CEO, James Sutherland, laughter was never far away when he was around, and it was no different on this occasion. 

But life must go on, no matter how torturous it may seem. No one knows this better than the Australia squad who were all at the SCG on Friday discussing if they were up to playing the first Test against India at the Gabba in Brisbane on Thursday after Hughes' tragic death.

For many his sudden passing is still too raw. Playing cricket at any level is the last thing on their minds with close friends, captain Michael Clarke and David Warner still devastated.

After the team session, Clarke left the SCG with Australia's team doctor, Peter Brukner, who knows better than anyone what his team captain has gone through these last few days.

Choking back tears, Brukner made a special tribute to Clarke in Thursday's hugely emotional press conference, saying that 'Philip's always been like a little brother to Michael.'

It all means that next week's first Test in Brisbane is still very much up in the air.

However, the 25-year-old maybe be gone, but he's not forgotten. 

Around 200 people attended the event at the SCG on Thursday night that went on until the early hours of Friday morning.

The whole front bar area was full and people spilled into the players’ dressing rooms where some had quiet moments of reflection. Others were walking out on the pitch thinking of their favourite memories of Hughes.

Players past and present were everywhere. Ricky Ponting, Glenn McGrath, Craig McDermott, Stuart Clarke, Simon Katich, Phil Jaques, and Mitchell Johnson - who had just got in from Perth on Thursday afternoon - were just a few of those present. 

Andrew Jones CEO of Cricket New South Wales (NSW) added that the event was arranged at only hours’ notice, and meant a huge amount to everyone at NSW and to players and officials from all over Australia.

‘It was wonderful to see the Australian cricket community come together last night in what was a special and moving few hours at the SCG involving players from all over Australia,’ he said.

“It was wonderful, albeit horrendously sad, to have them here. Everyone came together in a difficult time.”

But Hughes’ loss was not only felt in his homeland. One of the most poignant messages on Thursday night came from Middlesex county cricket club in England where he played for a short while.

‘He is, and always will be, fondly remembered here at Middlesex even in the short time he played for us. His average of 136.5 alone gives you the impression he left on us,’ the message read.

‘But most of all we remember a laidback, fun-filled, young man who was kind to everyone. What a great talent he was.’

On Friday NSW Premier Mike Baird announced that a State Memorial Service will be held to pay tribute to Hughes. The service will be held at the SCG on a date still to be determined.

Flower bouquets and remembrance cards were also already sitting outside the NSW cricket offices on Friday morning.

‘All over the country people were putting bats in their back yards and front windows in his memory. We thank all the people for those tributes,’ Sutherland said.
