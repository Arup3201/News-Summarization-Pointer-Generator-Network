A woman who endured ten years of torment by bullies for being too fat has now gone on to showcase her curves as a plus size beauty queen. 

Serena Francois, 23, from Bedford, Bedfordshire, was teased for a decade by her classmates who dubbed her 'afrogirl'.

The attacks took their toll on Serena leaving her with very low self-esteem and a fear of using public transport after the campaign of terror.

As well as mental bullying Serena was also the victim of several physical attacks throughout her time at the Catholic junior school she attended in Bedford .

The model was scarred for life when a girl dug her fingernails into the her arm and the incident left her traumatised.

The abuse continued in high school when she was branded 'fat' and one serious attack almost lost her eye sight.

Serena was pushed over by one of her tormentors, smashing her eye socket against a table and leaving doctors fearing for her vision. 

Serena found a new lease of life when she discovered plus size modelling 

And the abuse was so upsetting for the teenager that she feared attending school and her grades plummeted, forcing her mother to fork out for private tuition.

Serena says that the attacks were not only traumatising for herself but were also having an adverse effect on her family members.  

'It was really quite upsetting. I was so scared of school.

'My mum and nan were suffering anxiety attacks and I couldn't go out. I was so traumatised I couldn't even get on a bus.'

The bully victim couldn't even rely on respite when she left school as her first boyfriend verbally abused her.

In one terrifying attack Serena, pictured during her school years, was almost blinded after she was pushed to the ground and hit her eye socked against a table leaving doctors fearing for her sight 

Despite the constant put-downs Serena always dreamed of a modelling career and, although she finished in the top 10 of the Miss Bedford contest in 2013, she struggled to break into the world of modelling.

'I had done some local work but I was starting to wonder if this wasn't for me.'

It wasn't until Serena found a particular niche that she really found her talent in the modelling industry. 

'My mum suggested that I Googled 'plus-size models' and there it was, the answer I was looking for.

'I applied for Miss Curvaceous at the end of last year and then faced the nerve-wracking wait because the organisers just released the pictures of the girls who were through to the final over Christmas.

The beauty queen has now overcome her fears of education and returned to Bedford college to finish her A-levels and she now has qualified as a holistic beauty therapist

'It was such an amazing feeling to be chosen.'

The size 14 beauty queen will now take part in the Ms Curvaceous UK modelling competition at Canary Wharf, London, on January 31.

As well as her modelling success Serena has now transformed her life and conquered her fear of education to return to Bedford College to finish A-levels and volunteer part-time helping children with autism.

She has also gone on to study at university and qualify as a holistic beauty therapist - but insists that winning the Ms Curvaceous 2015 competition would be her biggest achievement yet.

'I really want to win now. I have the fire and the power to win it all after all I have been through.

'And I don't want to be just a model either. I want to be a role model for all the outsiders and other kids who've had to put up with this.'
