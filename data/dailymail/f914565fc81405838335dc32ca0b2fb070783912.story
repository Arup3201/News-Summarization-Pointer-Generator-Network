A young man has admitted to setting a teenager alight in a garage and causing him such horrific burns he had to be placed in a coma.

Joshua William Lomas, 21, pleaded guilty in the Adelaide Magistrates Court on Wednesday to causing serious harm to Luke Coburn, now 18,  in the garage of the teenager's home, north of Adelaide, in January 2013.

Luke's mother, Cheryl Coburn, said outside court that Lomas had chosen to target Luke because he was jealous her son had started dating a girl he liked.

'I’m really happy that he has decided to plead guilty, he has owned what he did and it’s in his best interests to do that,' Ms Coburn told the Advertiser.

She said her son had suffered both emotionally and physically from the attack and wouldn't regain full use of his arm.

Luke suffered third degree burns to his face, ear and arms when two attackers, one of which was Lomas, doused him in a flammable liquid and set him alight.

He had been in the garage of his home with a friend when the attack occurred and had to be placed in an induced coma.

'We need to know who the other guy is and the sooner we find that out then the better off we will all be,' Ms Coburn said.

'The fact that he hasn’t said who the other fella is yet and everything is just adding on; he needs to own up who the other fellow is and get it over and done with.'

Lomas, the only person charged to date, will be arraigned in the District Court on September 1.
