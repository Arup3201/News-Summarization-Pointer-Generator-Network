Anyone who's always wanted to live like an oligarch will soon have the chance after the entire contents of one of London's most exclusive hotels are auctioned off.

The Lanesborough, which is frequented by wealthy Russians and Arabs, is closing next month for a full renovation.

It will re-open next year - but without 3,500 items of furniture and fittings, which are being sold for an estimated £1.2million.

On sale: The royal state bed from the Lanesborough hotel, which is auctioning off its contents next month

Pricey: These elegant crystal chandeliers are expected to fetch £5,000 at the giant auction

Ornate: Canopied beds are among the 3,500 items of furniture and fittings available to be bought

The hotel on Hyde Park Corner, where every guest has a private butler and suites cost up to £18,000 a month, is currently decorated in a Regency style with antique furniture as well as exact replicas.

Designer Alberto Pinto is re-fitting the Lanesborough's 93 guest rooms as well as its lobbies and Michelin-starred restaurant, and replacement furniture will be installed.

The current contents will go up for auction at the hotel and online as more than 3,500 individual lots, starting on December 9.

The items being sold range from £5,000 chandeliers and four-poster beds to small framed prints currently adorning the walls.

Carpets and curtains, many of them specially made for the hotel when it first opened, are also on offer in the sale.

Potential buyers can bid for lots individually, or can buy the entire contents of one room in order to recreate the Lanesborough atmosphere in their own homes.

The hotel's managing director Geoffrey Gelardi said: 'This marks an unprecedented renovation project for the hotel which brings with it the opportunity to purchase a piece of the hotel’s history at auction as we pave the way for a new chapter for the Lanesborough.'

Auctioneer Mark Flynn, of Pro Auction, added: 'This really is going to be an exceptional event presenting a rare opportunity to acquire quality furnishings from one of the world’s leading hotels in the lead-up to refurbishment.

'It is possible for bidders to buy the entire contents of the bedrooms with a range of options to attract a variety of buyers and scales of purchase.'

Haul: The collection of furniture from the Lanesborough is expected to fetch around £1.2million

Lots: The 3,500 items are on sale either as individual items or as collections of objects from each of the hotel's rooms

Dining room: The hotel's restaurant, Apsleys, holds a Michelin star for its Mediterranean cuisine

He told the Evening Standard that the contents of the hotel would be worth tens of millions of pounds if they were sold off piece by piece.

The Lanesborough is located in a neo-classical building which once housed a hospital and reopened as a hotel in 1990.

It is owned by the government of Abu Dhabi and operated by an American firm, and is a favourite of the international super-rich on their trip to London.

Antique: The furniture would apparently be worth tens of millions of pounds if sold separately

Elegant: The hotel, favoured by Arab and Russian visitors, has been open since 1990

Fabrics: Carpets which were tailor-made for the Lanesborough are available to be bought

Past guests have included visiting royalty, while disgraced financier Bernie Madoff was once a regular visitor to the Lanesborough.

The hotel's prices start at around £400 a night, and all guests are given access to a butler who is on call 24 hours a day.

Every room contains a laptop available for use by guests, and the hotel's restaurant Apsleys holds a Michelin star.
