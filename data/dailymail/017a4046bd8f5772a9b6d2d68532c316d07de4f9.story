Ryan-Morgan Freeman, 10, played football with a cannonball dating back to the English Civil War before the bomb squad was called 

A 10-year-old boy played football with a cannonball dating back to the English Civil War before the bomb squad was called to blow it up.

Ryan-Morgan Freeman found the 17th century explosive in a bramble bush near his home in Sinfin, Derby, then used it in a kickabout with his friends on a basketball court.

But when the 10-year-old went home to show-off his rust-coloured find, his father Calvin, 31, feared it could be life-threatening and called the police.

'The thing was round so it just seemed natural to kick it. I thought dad was having a laugh when he told me it might be dangerous,' said Ryan.

'But when the bomb squad came and blew it up I knew I could have been badly hurt.'

A bomb squad carried out a controlled explosion on the sphere in a safe area near Ryan's family home.

Officers looked up the cannonball on the internet and decided it might have originated in the English Civil War era which started in 1642.  

'Ryan and a couple of his mates played football with it for a few minutes on the basketball courts at the end of our street,' said Mr Freeman.

'Luckily the court has a sponge-type floor which absorbed any impact. Ryan bought it home to show me. It was rust-coloured and about the size of a mini-football.

'It had two holes in the top and 4kh on it. I'm not an expert but I know that might have been military markings so I called the police.' 

Mr Freeman, 31, his partner Kerry, 30, and their five children aged six to 13 were ordered to evacuate their semi-detached home.

'I asked one of the bomb squad if it was dangerous and he replied it definitely was,' said Mr Freeman.

'I think Ryan had a close escape. If he had been kicking it around on a concrete floor the thing could have gone off.

'The council keep the bushes where it was found in good trim so I'm surprised it hadn't been found before.' 

Officers looked up the explosive on the internet and decided it might have originated in the English Civil War era, pictured are cannonballs found at Goodrich Castle which are thought to have been used in 1645
