Today show host Hoda Kotb is dating New York financier Joel Schiffman - and has declared she is very much 'in love', Daily Mail Online can reveal.

The striking 50-year-old TV personality has been dating Joel, 56, for more than a year and a half and has so far remained extremely coy about her beau, going so far as to blur his face in pictures and only referring to him as 'Boots'.

But on Friday, the once-married star - who is now considering a trip back down the aisle - told Today co-host Carson Daly, standing in for her regular pal Kathie Lee Gifford: 'I'm in love, love's good!'

Make a splash

Hoda Kotb knocked our socks off when she appeared like a vision on a Miami beach in a beautiful blue & white bandeau bikini.

The 49-year-old Today Show host had us feeling all kinds of envious; That tan, that tummy and that flowing white sarong!

A blue and white bandeau bikini has suddenly become a must have on our shopping lists.

We love the gathered fabric at the center of Hoda's bikini top so our edit is chock full of options that also flatter a smaller bust (Not that Hoda needs it)!

Our favorite is The Zimmerman confetti layered bikini from Revolve. Those ruffles are the way to create some serious va va voom!

Or cop a steal in Forever 21's reversible tropical print number! It's a two for one deal; On one side it's blue, on the other, it's coral. With the $14.90 price tag you can't go wrong!

Relief: Hoda Kotb speaks out about her boyfriend, Joel Schiffman live on the Today show today with guest host Billy Bush

Happy: Hoda has been dating Joel for nearly two years - and showed off a picture of the couple together

Out in the open: Hoda Kotb grinned as she showed off Daily Mail Online's story on air 

As a stunned Carson told her: 'I never heard you admit it!', she replied, amid whoops from the crew: 'I don't think I ever did until now, I mean, I did to him - he knows! But I really am in love.' 

We can reveal Hoda's boyfriend works for an investment firm in New York. He has been married once before and has a grown-up daughter. After visiting Hoda in New York on the Today show, Joel's daughter posted a message, calling her 'awesome'.

Today, Hoda happily spoke out about Joel on the Today show, as she co-hosted the 10am hour with guest host Billy Bush. Saying it was the 'most incredible day ever...I can't believe my fortune day today', he joked: 'You have been outed by the Daily Mail!'.

Hoda replied she had protected Joel for nearly two years, saying: 'You know when you're keeping something close to your chest', but said it was great to have her boyfriend 'out from the shadows'.

As she showed off Daily Mail Online's story on air, she admitted: 'I have to say, I feel like some relief, you know when you're keeping a secret...I talked to him this morning and I was like, 'Who cares?' He said, 'Who cares?'".

Billy even teased Hoda about Joel's physique, calling him a 'handsome stud', and she replied: 'Can you believe!'

Hoda, who was married to former tennis coach Burzis Kanga for two years until 2007, beamed with joy as she was spotted on vacation in Miami with Joel in December 2013  - and has now said she will not rule out marriage again.

The couple have been seen out on the town in Manhattan, with Hoda taking her love as her guest to the 25th annual Chris Evert/Raymond James pro-celebrity tennis classic gala in November in Florida, where she was one of the celebrity players.

They also joined Hoda's best friend Karen Swensen and her family at a Yankees game. And by New Year's Eve it was pretty clear the couple were out in the open as Joel joined Hoda at a celebratory dinner with her Today co-star Al Roker and his wife Deborah. 

The pair met by a twist of fate as Hoda told the Huffington Post in July: 'I almost didn't go out the night I met him. 'Cause you know how you don't feel like it because it's raining and icky and why not just watch a 'Law & Order' rerun and stay home and eat potato chips - and I'm so glad I went out that night because it was a chance meeting that ended up being kind of a life transforming event for me.'

The "Today" show host also opened up a little about what goes on in the bedroom with her 'wonderful guy', saying: 'For me, it is about connection. 

'No one is into the sport of [sex]. You want to have a real deep, honest connection. For me, that is such a valuable part of who you are.' 

Despite having had to re-enter the dating pool after her divorce, which she said she found 'awkward and weird and freaky', Hoda added: 'I have found real life joy right as I'm knocking on the door of 50. He's a wonderful guy and I feel very blessed.' 

Speaking about her decision to keep their romance out of the public eye, Hoda told Wendy Williams in October: 'When you're dating and it's in public, sometimes your dating life gets accelerated because people are asking 'what's going on, is it great, are you getting married?' and suddenly the whole thing, it just explodes.'

When Wendy asked: 'Are you getting married?' Hoda replied: 'You know what, I didn't think I would want to get married again, I've been married once before, but yes!'

She said Joel managed to woo her at an event with a 'bunch of Wall Street guys', where she was the speaker.

Afterwards, he asked her to sign his copy of her book.

Following her divorce, Hoda dated lawyer Jay Blumenkopf for a year before their split in December 2012.
