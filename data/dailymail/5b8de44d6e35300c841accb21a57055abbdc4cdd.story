Does di Maria want to be here?

When Angel di Maria arrived at Man United, we all thought: ‘Wow, what an addition to the Premier League!’

Now he looks like he’s not interested.

At the start of the season, di Maria was gliding across the field, but at the moment he looks weak and sluggish. We all know what he is capable of and the United fans deserve better.

It doesn’t help when your manager over-complicates things, but Di Maria has been nowhere near good enough for a player who cost so much. His form has dipped dramatically, as our table shows, and if he doesn’t improve there will be some serious stick coming his way.

There is not a player in the world who doesn’t go through a bad patch but we all want to see more from him. I certainly hope his dip doesn’t suggest he will be angling for pastures new in the summer.

Arsenal striker Olivier Giroud celebrates having scored the Gunner's second at Selhurst Park on Saturday

Giroud hits 50

A lot of people, myself included, have been critical of Olivier Giroud in the past.

There has always been too much focus on what he can’t do rather than what he can. But now he is an absolutely key man for Arsenal.

He’s not your typical Gunners player. He’s big, strong and likes to play through the middle, but his role at the top of the team lets the rest of the creative dynamos buzz around him. He scores headers, which is a different weapon for Arsenal, and with 50 goals now it’s no wonder Arsene Wenger values him so highly.

Tim's tough job

The last thing you want in your first game in charge is to face a Mark Hughes team.

It was a hard start for Villa’s Tim Sherwood and I bet even he is surprised by the task he now faces. His appointment was a coup for the club but he has a job on his hands. That squad is too good to go down.

City's fab four

Manchester City took Newcastle apart on Saturday. That’s because they finally had their best midfield playing.

When David Silva, Yaya Toure, Samir Nasri and Fernandinho start, City win. Unfortunately for them it has only happened three times this season — against Crystal Palace, Sunderland and Newcastle.

Injuries and absences mean they have not played often enough but they were a joy to watch. City play off the cuff and with that four they are much more fluid.

Using Fernando and Fernandinho is too defensive and with Silva flying and Toure over that poor patch at the start of the season, City looked back to their best.

P.S It will be interesting to see if Eliaquim Mangala or Martin Demichelis gets the nod against Barcelona tomorrow. Mangala (right) has had his problems but he’s a good player. Demichelis was sent off in their tie last year so if Mangala plays, he must be ready for Messi and Co.

It's tight in the Championship

7 - Darren Bent has scored seven goals in eight games for Derby since his loan move in January.

Darren Bent scored yet again for Derby to take them to the top of the Championship. It was a great result for them to come from behind twice against Sheffield Wednesday to win and with Middlesbrough and Bournemouth losing, the race at the top of the Championship will go right to the wire.

Derby are my favourites to win it now, but I bet Aston Villa wish Bent was scoring all of these goals for them...

Liverpool defender Martin Skrtel rises highest to beat Southampton's Graziano Pelle to the ball on Sunday

Skrtel's a rock

5 - Liverpool have kept five straight away clean sheets in the League for the first time since 1985.

Philippe Coutinho and Raheem Sterling will get the plaudits for their goals at Southampton on Sunday, but Martin Skrtel has been vital for Liverpool in recent weeks.

It was brave by Brendan Rodgers to switch to a back three and he has made that system work. It shows you what an intelligent manager he is.

But it’s players that make systems, and Skrtel has been a rock. It suits him to sit in the middle with men around him and he sees situations early.

We know he’s a brave, combative player but he has shown he is a classy operator too, and he has helped Liverpool get right back in the race for the top four. Their home game against Man City on Sunday will be huge.

Jose launches a charm offensive

It was great to see Jose Mourinho talking on Sky’s Goals on Sunday programme and it made for some fascinating viewing. 

It was only a few weeks ago that he was refusing to speak to the media at all after Diego Costa’s ban. Jose obviously still feels key decisions are going against his team, so now he is back on the charm offensive to see if that helps.

Spurs late show

Spurs got away with one on Sunday. They could have been three or four behind against West Ham but did well to recover late in the game. They have won 16 points from losing positions this season, with most of those coming very late on. That shows great spirit. This week they will need it.

A tough return leg against Fiorentina in the Europa League and a Capital One Cup final against Chelsea could make or break their season.

It will be a real test for this young squad but they did well to make sure they didn’t start it off with a disappointing home defeat.

Caulker's taken a backwards step

I’m not sure what’s happened to Steven Caulker. It’s been more than two years since he scored on his England debut and back then he looked like one of the country’s brightest youngsters.

He was poor in the build-up for Hull’s goals on Saturday. Now he needs to do better and start learning quickly.

Jamie's Premier League number crunching

4 - Branislav Ivanovic has been prolific for Chelsea recently. The powerful right back (right) has scored four goals in his last six games. He struck against Liverpool in the Capital One Cup, Aston Villa and Burnley in the League and Paris Saint-Germain in the Champions League. Loic Remy, Eden Hazard and Willian are the only other players to have scored in that period, with one each.

17 - Liverpool have been the Premier League’s form side in 2015. They have won 17 out of a possible 21 points, winning five and drawing two games.

9 - Romelu Lukaku had nine shots at goal without scoring against Leicester, joint-most in a PL game this season. Graziano Pelle matched that tally against Stoke.

560 - It has not been a good start to 2015 for Manchester United or Wayne Rooney. The United captain finally struck his first shot on target of the year in the Premier League at Swansea. It took him 560 minutes to do so.

Joey Barton's red card was the ninth dismissal he has received over the course of a controversial career 

3 - Joey Barton has only played for three full seasons at QPR, but he has already been sent off three times for them — more than any other player in the club’s Premier League history.

100 - Brad Guzan started his 100th consecutive PL game on Saturday. The Aston Villa goalkeeper is the first to do so since Stoke’s Jon Walters in October 2013.

15 - Cheikhou Kouyate’S header at White Hart Lane was West Ham’s 15th headed goal of the season. That’s already more than any side managed last season. In 2013-14, Liverpool scored the most headers with 14.
