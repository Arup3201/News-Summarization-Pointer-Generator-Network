She is said to have been one of the founding figures of the Swinging Sixties.

Twiggy and Bianca Jagger were among the figures Barbara Hulanicki, the fashion guru and founder of the iconic boutique Biba, dressed in the label's heyday.

But now the fashion designer believes the sexual revolution has gone too far, with celebrities no longer expressing themselves through new fashion but some bearing so much flesh they resemble porn stars.

Hulanicki branded some of the clothes now worn on the red carpet as 'horrible'. 

‘There’s no mystery. Talk about cleavages. It’s like porn – over the top,' Hulanicki told the Daily Telegraph. 

The Polish-born designer said she feels the revolution has gone too far, with young girls now taking the pill earlier than ever

She said: ‘What’s scary now is that there are very young girls taking it. They’re starting too early. It’s not about love anymore. We’ve been liberated too much.’

Ms Hulanicki said the launch of the pill in 1961 - at the start of the sexual revolution that gave women more freedom to express themselves - was welcome at the time. 

She said women began to be aware of their own shape and were no longer forced to live in what she described as 'hormonal hell.'

Ms Hulanicki admitted she took the pill herself, something which she felt gave her a 'happier life' and husband.

The 78-year-old this week announced her return to Biba, now owned by House of Fraser, after decades of absence. 

Ms Hulanicki launched a fashion mail-order company in 1963 with her husband Stephen Fitz-Simon

The label was relaunched four years ago by the department store and Hulanicki will now work as a consultant.

She launched the firm, which began as a mail order fashion business before opening its first store in London, 50 years ago with her husband Stephen Fitz-Simon.

Biba became known for its daring fashion and helped to define some of the clothes in the swinging sixties.  

 Ms Hulanicki is now an interior designer in Miami after losing control of her company name in the seventies.

Barbara Hulanicki claims to have been interested in fashion in a young age, saying clothes were 'always more than a mere necessity' 

She was born in Warsaw in Poland in 1936 before relocating with her family to Jerusalem 

Their life in Jerusalem ended in 1948 when her father was taken from the family home and found dead the next day 

She went back to England to live with her mother and two sisters including the youngest Beatrice, nicknamed Biba and the inspiration behind the fashion label

Ms Hulanicki started buying affordable but fashionable clothes and went to Brighton College of Art 

In the 1950s Ms Hulanicki met her husband Stephen Fitz-Simon, who worked in advertising

In 1963 the pair set up a mail order fashion company under the name Biba and orders began to gather pace

The first Biba shop opens at 87 Abingdon Road in Kensington, London, in 1964 selling low-priced, high-fashion clothes and accessories.

In 1966 Biba moved to 19-21 Kensington Church Street and becomes associated with the iconic figures of the swinging sixties such as Brigitte Bardot, Mia Farrow and her then husband Frank Sinatra

The first Biba department store opens at 120 Kensington High Street in 1969 expanding into menswear, make-up, jewellery, paint, cushions, fringed lampshades and satin sheets.

In 1973 Big Biba opened at 99-117 Kensington High Street in the old Derry & Toms store; seven storeys including a roof garden, restaurant/music venue and food hall. A million people visited every week – David Bowie and Marc Bolan were regulars.

In 1975 the fall of the company was dramatic and in  the space of months Ms Hulanicki lost control of it to British Land, one of the largest property development and investment companies in the UK.

Between 1976-2006 there were several unsuccessful attempts to relaunch the Biba label, none of which involved Ms Hulanicki.

The label was relaunched again by House of Fraser in 2009, this time successfully. 

In 2011 model Daisy Lowe appeared in the House of Fraser Biba campaign

Barbara Hulanicki founded the label in the 1960s which quickly became associated with several celebrities
