The England WAGs have been banned from attending the World Cup in a bid to avoid the players being distracted.

So news that a naked woman has been flashing at the squad's Brazil hotel will no doubt leave them reeling.

The anonymous woman appeared on the balcony at the five-star Royal Tulip hotel while the team were training at their Sugarloaf Mountain training
 base in Rio.

Meanwhile on the other side of the world another naked woman caused a stir today when was
she was photographed on of the balcony of the Rio hotel the England squad are staying in

Look out: The woman admires the view from the balcony at the Royal Tulip hotel

Cover up: Maybe next time she should get dressed inside

The woman, who was completely nude, walked out of the sliding doors attached to her room and stood by the railings.

She then walked back to her room before finally pulling out a black lace top.

'She wasn't exactly shy. She looked as if she was trying to attract someone's attention. She was well aware she could been seen,' a witness told the Daily Star.

With 
England needing victory against Uruguay to keep their hopes of staying 
in the World Cup alive on Thursday, the last thing they need is any 
distractions.

There is an increased security presence at the hotel with England 
staying there throughout the duration of their spell in the finals.

Just
 days before the Three Lions opening Group D defeat by Italy, three fans
 managed to make their way past 20 armed guards after saying they needed
 to use the toilet.

Andy Richardson, 22, Alex Hill, 20, and Josh Pearce, 19 had selfies taken with Roy Hodgson's team.

Security are on on duty 24-hours a day for the month-long tournament as
 the team enjoy the hotel's indoor and outdoor pools, superior 
restaurants and bars.

In
 contrast to previous tournaments, England have just two floors of the 
17-floor, 418-room hotel, with the public and fellow guests allowed to 
mingle freely with them.

In May, the FA insisted it wasn't worried about England's World Cup 
hotel even though out-of-date food was seized from the Royal Tulip. 

Health inspectors took 2.362kg of unusable butter as well as salmon and
 Parma ham. Bizarrely, the luxury venue was also fined for not providing
 condoms to guests.

Meanwhile, despite Roy Hodgson's ban Wayne Rooney's wife has flown out to Brazil with sons Kai, four, and Klay one.

She said: ‘I don’t want the boys to grow up and say, “How come you never took us to watch my dad play in the World Cup?”.’

She added: ‘I actually prefer watching the World Cup at home, especially when the weather’s fantastic.’

Coleen Rooney finally arrived in Brazil last night after a marathon journey from Manchester via Heathrow before settling into her five star boutique hotel in Rio de Janeiro

The
 England team schedule means she and the boys might not even get to see 
Wayne, but she said: ‘At least he knows we’re there and we’re going to 
support him.’

It is not
 known how many other WAGS will heed Hodgson’s ban but Alex Gerrard, 31,
 the model wife of England captain Steven, 34, was seen partying with 
friends on the beach of Spanish isle of Ibiza on Saturday seemingly 
without a care in the world.

The
 mother-of-three has previously revealed that despite Hodgson’s 
WAG-veto, she would travel to Brazil if England get through to the later
 stages.

On Thursday England will take on Group D rivals Uruguay, who also lost their first game, to Costa Rica 3-1.

Since 1953, the national team has won three, drawn three, and lost four games against the South American side, and so far only three teams in the last century have ended up overall winners after losing their first match.

The England v Uruguay game will take place at the Arena de Sao Paulo, and kicks off at 8pm.
