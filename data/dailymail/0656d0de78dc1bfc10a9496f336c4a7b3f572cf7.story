Luis Enrique is still struggling with the biggest decision of his career so far as Barcelona coach – to start, or not to start, with Luis Suarez.

British viewers will miss the first 15 minutes of Saturday's game due to broadcasting regulations.

In the build up to the midweek match with Ajax, Enrique told reporters before the game that Pedro would definitely be playing - effectively revealing his starting line-up.

'No, I can't play that game today,' he said on Friday when asked if wanted to repeat the early shout on who was in and who was out.

'Suarez will get minutes but I can't say how many,' he said. 'This is a great chance for him to incorporate himself in the team. How many minutes he will get I can't say.'

When asked if it was better for a player to start a game or come on in the second half after such a long lay-off, he against batted away the inquiry saying: 'Every player is different for some players it's better to play from the start for others to come on in the second half.'

Suarez's anxiety to kick-off his Barcelona career lends itself to throwing him in from the first kick but Enrique has also practiced with a four man midfield this week, with Xavi Hernandez back in the side alongside Andres Iniesta, Sergio Busquets and Ivan Rakitic behind a front two of Neymar and Lionel Messi.

If Enrique opts for that tactic his formation will mirror Carlo Ancelotti's who looks set to play Toni Kroos, James Rodriguez, Isco and Luka Modric in midfield having confirmed Gareth Bale will miss the game with a buttock injury.

Real Madrid: 

Casillas; Carvajal, Pepe, Ramos, Marcelo; Rodriguez, Modric, Kroos, Isco; Ronaldo, Benzema 

Barcelona:

Bravo; Alves, Pique, Mascherano, Mathieu; Rakatic, Busquets, Iniesta; Suarez, Messi, Neymar 

'The absence of Bale does not change the way we will play the game. We have our ideas and follow them. We don't change,' said Enrique, who despite the bravado will know Madrid are a different proposition without Bale, leaning more on possession and less on explosive counter attacks.

There was one thing both coaches agreed to be unhappy with – the kick-off time. The game has been scheduled for 6pm local time to reach a wider global television audience at prime time. Ancelotti has complained most vehemently after his side had to travel back from Liverpool after their later midweek Champions League game.

'Ancelotti is right when he says the kick-off time is not ideal,' said Enrique. 'It is a problem for all of us but everything works around the interests of television. It is a lot better for all of us playing later.'

The Barça coach also said that he was not worried about provocation from Pepe on Saturday as Suarez plays his first competitive game since biting Italy's Giorgio Chiellini. He said: 'There is physical contact in football and we accept that and there is also a referee to make sure there is fair play. I'm sure it will be a great game and a good spectacle.'

On Suarez, Ancelotti said: 'I am not here to judge the behaviour of Luis Suarez. I rate him a lot as a player, he is a fantastic player, he scored a lot of goals in England but whether he plays or not does not change our tactics for the game if they are with Suarez or without Suarez – it is good news for football that Suarez can play in the Spanish league.'
