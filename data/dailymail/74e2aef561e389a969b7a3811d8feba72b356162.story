A mother left with mounds of overhanging skin after losing 10 stone through a gastric bypass  is begging to have it removed on the NHS so she can find love.

Sarah Lord, of Wakefield, was a size 12 before she fell pregnant with her daughter Bryony, now 12.

But after her relationship with Bryony's father came to an end four months into her pregnancy, she became depressed and gave into cravings and comfort eating.

The 30-year-old was referred for bariatric surgery by her doctor, and went on to lose 10 stone, swapping a diet of fry ups and pies for stir fries and fruit.

Although she says she feels healthier after losing weight, Miss Lord has been left with a huge flap of excess skin which has ruined her confidence and left her too insecure to attract men or wear a bikini

Miss Lord had become depressed after a break-up four months into her pregnancy, and gained weight after turning to comfort eating (left). After her gastric bypass (right) she changed her diet and began exercising

The procedure has left her with a pouch of saggy skin around her waist, which she says has ruined her confidence and left her unable to attract men.

Miss Lord, who works as a team leader for the Yorkshire Ambulance Service NHS Trust, said: 'I've gained a lot of positives, but the saggy skin is holding me back from my happy ending.

'I'd like to have someone to share my life with - and no man can fancy me with all this excess skin. I need to get it removed.

'I've asked the NHS for another funded op - now I just need to hear back from my doctor to see if I qualify.'

At 16 weeks into her pregnancy, Miss Lord's relationship with her daughter's father broke down.

She said: 'The pregnancy was making me feeling anxious enough, and the breakup was very upsetting. I fell into a dip of depression, which I coped with through eating.'

By the time Bryony was attending her first days at school, Miss Lord had ballooned six dress sizes and gained ten stone, leaving her at 22 stone and size 24.

BEFORE

Breakfast: Bacon, egg and sausage sandwich 

Lunch: Pie and chips

Dinner: Beef stew with Yorkshire pudding

Snacks: Crisps and chocolate 

 

AFTER

Breakfast: Cereal

Lunch: Jacket potato and salad

Dinner: Chicken stir fry with vegetables

Snacks: Fruit and yoghurt 

She said: 'I was in and out of hospital for various reasons. As my weight increased I seemed to be more prone to abscesses under my arms and on my bikini line.

'Friends thought I was bubbly and outgoing, but inside I was finding things really difficult.

'Whenever I found myself in an argument with anyone, my size was the first thing they would pick on, and it really hurt when they did.

'As people used harsh names, I became more and more reclusive.'

Her depression reached such a state that she was recommended a course of antidepressants by her GP, but she decided against relying on drugs to improve her mood.

Eventually, her doctor suggested that a NHS gastric bypass would combat her mounting health problems and attack the route cause of her depression.

After an assessment she underwent the procedure at Dewsbury and District Hospital in September 2010.

She said: 'Before the bypass I'd tried to lose weight in the gym, but nothing had ever worked.

'The weight loss after the operation was unbelievable. I lost eight stone in a year, and a further two the year after that.

'Instead of spending my evenings gorging on food I got involved in some intense boot camps at my local gym. There were moments after a heavy session where I could barely walk.

'I was exercising five times a week and the pounds were melting away.'

She also completely overhauled her diet, further accelerating her weight loss.

Before her operation, she typically ate a greasy bacon, egg and sausage sarnie for breakfast, followed by pie and chips for lunch.

In the evenings she would tuck into comfort food like beef stew with Yorkshire puddings.

She snacked on crisps and chocolate throughout the day.

After the bypass, she enjoyed cereal for breakfast, followed by jacket potato and salad for lunch.

For her evening meal she typically made chicken stir-fry with plenty of vegetables.

When she snacks today, she indulges on fruit and yoghurt.

While her physical appearance and general health improved, she found her confidence dipping.

She said: 'There's absolutely no question about whether or not I feel healthier, but whether or not I feel more confident, that's a whole different story.

'In the past I was confident enough to meet up with men after meeting them on a night out, but I wouldn't do it again. I don't feel comfortable with my loose skin.

'Now whenever I find myself talking to a man at a bar I always make an excuse to leave early. I tend to just say "I'm with someone else".

'When I'm on holiday I'll always wear a modest swimsuit. I never wear anything tight around my stomach area.'

Miss Lord is happy to be healthier after the gastric bypass, but desperately wants the NHS to remove the excess skin. Such a procedure would cost around £15,000 at a private clinic

She is now waiting for a green light from NHS bosses so that she can have an operation to remove the saggy skin from her waistline.

The cost of such an operation from a private clinic would be around £15,000. 

She said: 'My GP has tried to get me funding for the operation four times but every time it has been denied. 

'This is my fifth application for the saggy skin removal op so I am really hoping that I am eligible this time.'

Despite her struggles with low confidence, Miss Lord said she has gained a lot of positives.

She said: 'I feel much more freedom in my movement and my daughter Bryony looks up to me. I wouldn't want her to end up like how I did.'

After weight loss, proteins in skin tear and break, resulting in a loss of elasticity and strength

Losing weight is the answer to many people's prayers.

But they may not realise dramatic weight loss can have a deeply distressing side-effect: excess skin.  

This hidden downside of losing weight occurs as a result of damage to the deeper layers of skin, the dermis, which contains two proteins: elastin, which helps it retract, and collagen, for strength.

When the skin is stretched too much through weight gain, these proteins tear and break, resulting in a loss of elasticity and strength.

Unfortunately, while losing weight causes the fat cells to lose their fat, the skin cannot retract.

It is linked unpleasant health problems, from infections to back pain.

Doctors say the excess skin after weight loss is the same skin damage that occurs during pregnancy — but all over the body.

Factors that affect how much skin is left include age, how quickly the weight was lost (gastric bands are slower than bypasses, for example), and, for women, the number of children she has had.

Many patients patients develop an 'apron' of skin around the abdomen, and loose skin under the arms, chest and inner thighs.

This excess skin can cause a range of medical problems.

One of the most common is intertrigo - a bacterial, fungal, or viral infection that occurs often due to the difficulty in keeping these folds of excess skin clean and dry.

Patients also find the folds of skin make it difficult to exercise. 

Excess skin is a problem particularly for people who undergo weight loss surgery.
