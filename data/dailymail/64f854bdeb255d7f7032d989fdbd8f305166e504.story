The children of a 48-year-old stroke victim have been forced into a lengthy battle with the NHS after doctors placed a controversial ‘do not resuscitate’ order on their father.

Days after Paul Scoble was admitted to Basildon Hospital in Essex, doctors applied to put the DNR notice on his medical notes – meaning they would let him die if he suffered a cardiac arrest. The orders are controversial because they can be applied despite strong objections from relatives if doctors think they are in a patient’s ‘best interests’.

Since August, doctors have applied four times to put a DNR on Mr Scoble, who has extensive brain damage. He is immobile, confined to an intensive care bed, reliant on a ventilator and largely unable to communicate.

But his son Leon and daughter Danielle believe he could recover – and want him moved. They claim Basildon Hospital has ‘given up’ on him, and an independent specialist brought in by the hospital to assess the case said he should be resuscitated, if needed, adding: ‘It is my opinion that full active treatment is in Paul’s best interests.’

Dr Chris Danbury found there had been ‘considerable improvement in his neurology’, and he was ‘noticeably more awake and interactive’. He said he had seen similar patients recover to ‘a reasonable functional state’ – although others had died.

The hospital ‘categorically refutes’ any allegation it has ‘given up’ on the case. A spokesman said: ‘We would not deny Mr Scoble the opportunity of life-saving treatment if that was a realistic option.’

But Leon Scoble, 28, from Harlow, Essex, claimed he and his sister had been forced to battle doctors from the start. He said: ‘I’m not going to let him go without fighting my hardest. I wouldn’t be able to live with myself.

‘That’s my dad. But the doctors at Basildon – they can’t understand that. Their attitude was, “We are going to give up”. But they never thought that we would actually fight it.

‘If you believe something’s wrong, don’t you fight it?’

He claimed his father understood and had mouthed ‘Don’t stop’ to him.

Miss Scoble, 29, said last month one doctor advised them to ‘seriously consider’ what their father’s life would be like if he lived on.

If he is to survive, Mr Scoble must have an operation to fix two leaky heart valves and be ‘weaned’ off his ventilator. Dr Danbury believes it is ‘more likely than not that he will die’ due to this treatment. But Miss Scoble said: ‘We’ve got to give him that chance.’

Doctors first applied for a DNR on August 20, then again on September 9. It was finally imposed on October 14, but was rescinded the next day after the siblings got lawyers involved.

On October 22, doctors reactivated the DNR, said Miss Scoble. It is now suspended while the family wait to hear if the Royal Brompton Hospital in London will admit Mr Scoble.

Doctors there say he ‘definitely should be considered for surgery’ but the risk of death is ‘extremely high’. They want to assess him in person.

A Basildon Hospital spokesman said last night: ‘We categorically refute any allegations that we have neglected Mr Scoble. We have done everything we can to deliver the best possible care in very difficult circumstances.’

He said NHS England officials agreed the hospital was ‘offering the most appropriate care’ based on the independent review. He added that doctors were awaiting Royal Brompton’s decision, and insisted: ‘We haven’t given up on him.’
