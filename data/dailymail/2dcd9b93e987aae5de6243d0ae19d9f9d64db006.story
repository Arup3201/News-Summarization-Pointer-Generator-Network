Former Swansea City boss Michael Laudrup is the latest name to enter the frame as Celtic hunt for a new manager.

Sources in Denmark claim that contact has been made with Laudrup’s representatives to assess his willingness to talk.

He was assisted at the Barclays Premier League side by former Celtic midfielder Morten Wieghorst, who could form part of a potential coaching team at Parkhead.

It’s believed the Scottish champions have been taking informal soundings from a number of potential candidates as they try and refine their options following Neil Lennon’s departure.

Malky Mackay, Owen Coyle, Oscar Garcia, Henrik Larsson, Steve Clarke and Wigan boss Uwe Rosler are among the other names to have been linked with the club, with Laudrup now adding an intriguing possibility to the list.

The 49-year-old is well versed about life in Glasgow through younger brother Brian, who achieved legendary status during his playing days with Rangers.

Laudrup guided Swansea to the League Cup during his time in charge - with a 5-0 victory over Bradford City at Wembley in 2013 - but was sacked in February of this year with his team sitting 12th in the Barclays Premier League.

He reached a settlement with the Welsh club over his dismissal earlier this week.

Spanish club Granada already want him as their new manager but the one-time Barcelona and Real Madrid forward has yet to commit to the struggling La Liga outfit as he assesses his options.

It remains to be seen whether Celtic will now enter into negotiations with Laudrup or first opt for another candidate.

Capped 104 times by Denmark in a glittering playing career that also included a spell at Juventus, Laudrup is known for favouring an attacking brand of football.

He began his management career with Brondby, enjoying league and cup success in his homeland before joining Getafe.

Laudrup steered them to a Copa Del Rey final and a decent UEFA Cup run, with less successful stints at Spartak Moscow and Real Mallorca preceding his arrival at Swansea.

The Dane was replaced at the Liberty Stadium by caretaker boss Gary Monk, before Monk was appointed on a permanent basis earlier this month.
