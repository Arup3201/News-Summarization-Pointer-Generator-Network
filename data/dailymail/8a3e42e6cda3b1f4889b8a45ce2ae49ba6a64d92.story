A doctor who was struck off eight years ago for 'stalking' Abi Titmuss has blamed the episode on his drinking problem as he tries to rekindle his medical career.

Shibley Rahman is trying to convince a medical panel that he is fit to be a doctor again, insisting he is no longer an alcoholic and feels 'horrible' about how he traumatised the former glamour model.

Rahman's medical career was left in tatters after a disciplinary panel found his behaviour towards the TV personality amounted to 'serious psychological violence'.

Struck off: Shibley Rahman's medical career ended abruptly in a 2006 hearing of the General Medical Council (left), which was told how he had 'stalked' the TV personality and glamour model Abi Titmuss (right)

Ms Titmuss, a former nurse, was left 'terrified' when the drunken doctor sneaked into a communal bathroom at her hospital staff accommodation while she showered in July 2004.

Rahman was struck off by the General Medical Council in 2006 and handed a restraining order the next year after admitting a public order offence at Highbury Corner Magistrates' Court. 

But on Thursday he told a fitness to practise panel of the Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service, held in Manchester, that he was ready to be a doctor again.

All doctors who have been struck off are allowed to ask permission to be restart their careers five years later.

Plea: Rahman, pictured outside the 2006 hearing, said he felt 'horrible' for the star and wished her well

Rahman told the panel he wanted to overcome the shame of being struck off, restore his reputation and make a valuable contribution to the profession.

The former senior house officer at Hammersmith Hospital, Northwick Park Hospital and Royal Brompton Hospital, all in London, added he had now dealt with his alcoholism.

'I think it is horrible,' he said. 'It would never happen again. It was disgusting... My behaviour towards her was unacceptable.

'If I ever saw her again I would just walk in the opposite direction. I would not look at her. I would just run off. I would certainly not trouble her again in any way.'

The former medic added: 'I really don't care about her or what she does, apart from the fact I really do feel horrible about the emotional impact on her, and I wish her well in the future.' 

The panel heard how Rahman began to contact Ms Titmuss after seeing her in media reports in 2004.

She had left her job as a nurse after becoming a household name when she stood by then-boyfriend John Leslie, who was falsely accused of rape.

But she was still living in nurses' accommodation at London's University College Hospital, where she worked from 1998 to December 2003.

Rahman, who was not previously known to Ms Titmuss, sent her a letter asking to meet before bombarding her agent with up to 20 text messages a day, the panel heard.

The junior doctor then began to turn up at her residence before introducing himself.

In a statement, the actress and former model said: 'He came straight up to me then shook my hand. It was very difficult to get away from him.

'He acted as though I knew him and was waiting all day for me to return. I had to ask reception not to tell Dr Rahman I was in.'

On one occasion in July 2004 Ms Titmuss arrived home to find Rahman, who smelt strongly of alcohol, waiting for her with a bunch of flowers.

On July 17 Rahman gained access to the nurses' rooms and Ms Titmuss returned from the bathroom to find him waiting outside her door.

She went into her room and Rahman started banging on the door and shouting abuse, the panel heard.

When he had stopped shouting Ms Titmuss went into a shower cubicle - but Rahman followed her into the communal bathroom and shouted at her again.

The 'terrified' celebrity returned to her room where Rahman continued to bang on her door until police arrived and warned him not to contact her again.

In a statement, the actress and former model (pictured) said: 'He came straight up to me then shook my hand. It was very difficult to get away from him... He acted as though I knew him and was waiting all day for me'

He told police he thought the media had been unfair to her and he thought he could help her because he was a doctor.

The medic continued to pester Titmuss and her agent until he received a written harassment warning on July 27, 2004, the tribunal heard. 

Announcing the decision to strike him off in July 2006, Dr Brian Alderman told Rahman: 'The panel takes the view that your actions in relation to Ms B [Ms Titmuss], who was a stranger to you and who you put in terror, is conduct not becoming of a doctor and is likely to bring the medical profession into disrepute.'

Rahman admitted 'harassing' Ms Titmuss and said he thought he could help with her charity work, but hoped it could lead to a romantic relationship.

He was arrested after another incident with Ms Titmuss in April 2007 when he approached her and shouted: 'You and your media team have ruined my life.'

Claims: The ex-doctor later accused Ms Titmus of wishing to 'capitalise on misery to further her own career'

The hearing was also told that while pursuing his legal career three years later, he wrote to the Solicitors Regulation Authority to say: '[Ms Titmuss] wished to capitalise on misery to further her own flagging career'. 

All doctors have the right to apply for re-registration five years after being erased from the register, but it is rare for applications to be granted.

The General Medical Council also opposes all restoration bids on principle.

The hearing continues.
