A hoarder stuck in a tiny bedsit piled high with rubbish had to be rescued by firefighters after care workers became concerned about her health.

Emergency crews used a cherry picker to reach the first floor flat above a takeaway shop and cut out the window frame to reach the stricken woman.

Rubbish piled high against the window came crashing down as it was removed, revealing a room crammed almost to the ceiling with binbags, cardboard, bottles and cans.

Pictures show a vast pile of clutter with a shopping trolley abandoned on top and what appears to be the top of a fridge just visible.

The woman, who has not been named, lived in the flat with her adult son. Both were described as 'vulnerable' by social services, and neighbours said the woman appeared 'well-educated' but was a 'loner'.

Social services raised the alarm after losing contact with the pair and being unable to get through the front door of the flat in Rush Green, Romford, Essex.

Neighbours said the woman's son had spoken to firefighters throughout the seven-hour rescue on Tuesday, May 14, and had said: 'She's not going to come down the stairs.'

Bernadette Angel, who owns a florist next to the flat, said. 'Social services had been knocking on the door for months. I don't think she could come out through the door.

'She was a hoarder and she was refusing to move.

'I don't think she actually mixed with anybody, it was just her and her son.'

Health worries: The woman, who is not being named, was taken to hospital but is not thought to be in a serious condition

Marathon: It took emergency services seven hours to safely remove the woman from the first floor flat

Another neighbour said: 'I used to talk to her when I saw her, but I hadn't seen her for a long time, since well before Christmas. She seemed quite an educated person when you spoke to her.

'She was a hoarder. When they took the window out, it was piled up.'

Other neighbours said they hadn't seen the woman for about a year, but that she appeared physically mobile then.

June Gundlack, who witnessed the rescue, said: 'The flat looked odd from the outside. When the firefighters were breaking in, you could see rubbish right up to the ceiling.

'There were lots of people watching, it caused quite a stir.'

The woman was taken to Queen's Hospital, Romford, but is not thought to be in a serious condition.

'Loner': Neighbours said they had not seen the woman for months and believed she could not get out

Support: Council workers have been keeping an eye on the woman and her son who are considered vulnerable

A Havering Council spokesman said: 'The council has been offering support to adult occupants in this privately rented property who were considered vulnerable.

'Yesterday, working with partner 
agencies, including the police, it was decided to gain entry to the 
property to make sure that they were safe and well.'

A London Fire Brigade spokesman said: 'People should try and avoid storing large amounts of clothes, papers and other materials, as it increases the chances of having a fire and intensifies the spread of fire if one does occur.'
