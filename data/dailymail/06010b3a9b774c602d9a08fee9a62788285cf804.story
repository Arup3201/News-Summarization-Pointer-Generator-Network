Treasurer Joe Hockey has called reports that the government was fully aware poorer households would be hardest hit by his budget 'misleading'.

Fairfax newspapers published pre-budget Treasury numbers on Monday which backed private modelling that showed the tough May budget was unfair.

According to the Treasury analysis, an average low income family loses $844 per year in disposable income, while middle income earners only forfeit $492.

A high-income family is just $517 worse off.

Mr Hockey has hit out at the report as 'deliberately misleading'.

However, Shadow Treasurer Chris Bowen accused the Treasurer of having a 'glass jaw' and ridiculed him for attacking the media over the report.

Joe Hockey has hit out at a 'misleading' media report which showed his budget spending cuts have cost lower income families an average of $842 a year

Labor's Mr Bowen said Mr Hockey could not disown the figures.

'These are Treasury figures,' Mr Bowen told ABC radio. 'This is the direct impact of decisions in his budget.'

Mr Hockey said high income earners paid more tax than those on lower incomes, while the analysis did not include benefits such as subsidised medicines.

'It doesn't take into account that higher income households pay half their income in tax,' an angry Mr Hockey told the Nine Network.

'It also fails to take into account the massive number of concessional payments, such as discounted pharmaceuticals ... discounted transport, discounted childcare, that goes to lower income households.'

Mr Hockey is struggling to sell his budget to the electorate and key crossbenchers in the Senate.

Cuts to welfare, an increase in the fuel tax and the GP co-payment are among the most contentious measures.

Parliamentary secretary to the treasurer Steve Ciobo said it was 'obvious' that those who received government benefits would be worse off because of the spending cuts.

Higher income earners would pay more in taxes because of measures like the deficit levy, he said.

'(But) obviously people who rely on more government support will feel those changes,' he told ABC radio.

When the government handed down its widely criticised budget in May, they were aware cost cutting would hit poor families harder, according to a Freedom of Information request

The Fairfax media report said when the government handed down its widely criticised budget in May, they were aware cost cutting would hit poor families harder.

The analysis was one of several provided to the government, but the Treasury failed to release more than one detailed model ahead of the budget.

A spokeswoman for Treasurer Joe Hockey said average low-income households would still receive $12,604 in 2016-17 in cash transfers like family benefits.

'Our budget aims to make the welfare system sustainable and to reduce $123 billion in projected deficits and debt, heading towards $667 billion without remedial action,' she said.

'Our budget is focused around building a stronger economy so Australians can experience more and better jobs.'

The submissions reportedly showed poorer families would suffers larger falls in disposable income rather than richer households, especially for those with children aged between six and 16.
