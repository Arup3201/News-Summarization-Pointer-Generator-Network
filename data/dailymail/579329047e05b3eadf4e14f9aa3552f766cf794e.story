Foul-mouthed Cabinet Minister Andrew Mitchell should be sacked for insulting police officers who made him get off his bicycle at the gates to Downing Street, according to a Mail on Sunday poll.Two in three believe the Chief Whip should be forced to quit, with barely one in five backing his fight to hang on to his job.

Calls for sacking: Many have called for Andrew Mitchell to go after his 'foul mouthed rant'

Even Conservative voters have turned on him – more than half say he should go, with fewer than one in three backing him.

Mr Mitchell stayed tight-lipped yesterday as the furore continued over claims that he called police ‘morons’ and ‘f*****g plebs’ in a petulant outburst.

Tory MPs and senior Whitehall officials said he would be lucky to survive, while others gave additional alleged examples of the former Rugby School pupil’s high-handed manner.

According to civil servants at the Department for International  Development – run by Mr Mitchell, 56, until the Cabinet reshuffle earlier this month – his insistence on receiving VIP treatment while  on foreign trips with his special adviser Philippa Buckley, sometimes backfired.

‘He liked to be the last passenger on board the plane, presumably so he didn’t have to get on with the plebs,’ said one.

‘Airline staff would get fed up with it and on at least one occasion he missed the plane as a result.

They shut the gate and wouldn’t let him on. He was furious and had to get another flight.’

One Tory MP said he had been the victim of another four-letter tirade by Mr Mitchell.

He recalled: ‘I was an aspiring MP and had committed a minor indiscretion that Mitchell took exception to.

‘He told me, “While I have a single f*****g breath in my body I will make sure you never become an MP.”  The man is an appalling bully. I can see why he was known as Thrasher at Rugby.’

Friends of the Prime Minister say they warned him against promoting Mr Mitchell to Chief Whip because of his reputation for politically incorrect tantrums.

David Cameron and Mr Mitchell fell out when the allies of Mr Mitchell made allegations of a dirty-tricks campaign when they were both rivals seeking their first Parliamentary seat.

Relations between the two deteriorated further when Mr Mitchell ran David Davis’s unsuccessful bid to beat Mr Cameron in the 2005 Tory leadership contest.

It was only after Mr Mitchell’s ally George Osborne intervened on his behalf that a wary Mr Cameron gave Mr Mitchell a second chance.

Mr Mitchell then promptly fell out with Mr Davis.

A senior Minister said: ‘Andrew got back in with Cameron by crawling. Whenever he is within ten yards of the PM you can hear the sound  of slurping.’

One MP who criticised the Prime Minister in front of Mr Mitchell was surprised by his response. ‘He said, “Whenever my local activists complain about Cameron I tell them don’t blame me, I ran David Davis’s campaign.” I am not sure if he was joking.’

Hanging on: Andrew Mitchell on his bicycle at the gates to Downing Street

Mr Mitchell’s supporters freely admit that he can be volatile, but say he is ‘misunderstood’.

One said: ‘For 99 per cent of the time he is charm personified – you have to ignore the bluster.’

Mr Mitchell is hoping that the  tradition whereby the Chief Whip does not speak in public will help him to survive this storm.

It means he is less likely to be  challenged to account for his verbal onslaught against the police.One rebel Tory claimed Mr Mitchell was now ‘neutered’ as Chief Whip.

‘He can no longer enforce party discipline,’ said the MP.

‘If he calls me in to discipline me, I will say, “You insulted a policeman, that’s worse than anything I have done, so back off.” ’

Conservative MP Peter Bone said ‘stupid’ Mr Mitchell should resign if he had made the remarks attributed to him, adding: ‘It defies belief that anyone could swear at a police officer – especially one who was  in Downing Street to protect the Prime Minister.’

Fellow Tory MP Brian Binley said: ‘Andrew Mitchell’s actions strengthen the impression that those at the top of the party are a bunch of elitists who think they are better than others.’
