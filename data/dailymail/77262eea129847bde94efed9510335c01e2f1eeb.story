Manchester City will increase their efforts to sign Eliaquim Mangala
 from Porto even though Mehdi Benatia has made it clear he wants to 
leave Roma.

City consider Benatia an alternative to France defender Mangala although both have expressed a preference to join Chelsea.

Alvaro 
Negredo remains a target for Atletico Madrid who are convinced the 
player wants to leave City.

In action: Medhi Benatia wants to leave Roma, but would prefer a move to Chelsea over City

City
 have confirmed the £12m signing of Fernando and will hold talks with 
Yaya Toure over his future once he returns from the World Cup.

Atletico midfielder Tiago is expected to complete his free transfer back to Chelsea next week.

Chelsea are keen to take former Charlton midfielder Diego Poyet and loan him to Dutch side Vitesse.

Queens Park Rangers want to make Steven Caulker their next signing.

The newly promoted London club have placed a bid for the Cardiff City centre-back and ideally want to team him with Rio Ferdinand at the heart of a new-look defence.

Rangers are one of several clubs keen on the 22-year-old England international, who is expected to leave Cardiff following their relegation last season and has a release clause in his contract.

Although there is interest from Southampton, Swansea, Liverpool and Everton, manager Harry Redknapp hopes to to persuade him of Rangers' ambition and convince him that alongside Ferdiand he can play regularly and lay claim to an England place again.

Caulker has family in the south of England who he wants to remain close to and that is another factor in Rangers' favour.

Redknapp has agreed a deal in principle with Ferdinand, 35, but there is opposition within the club to recruiting too many ageing players.

Nice left-back Timothee Kolodziejczak is another target for QPR as they look to rival West Ham and Southampton for the 22-year-old who rejected Manchester United as a teenager. Nice want around £4million for a player rated the best left-back in France.

Redknapp is looking to bring in two strikers and another midfielder with Derby County's Craig Bryson an option. Burnley yesterday had a £750,000 bid rejected for Scotland international Bryson.

Sunderland have offered £10million for Fabio Borini at Liverpool. The Anfield club want around £12.5m for the Italian striker who enjoyed a successful loan at the Stadium of Light last season.

The deal is understood to break down as £8million with £2m in add-ons for the 23-year-old. Borini has also been discussed a possible makeweight in a deal for Lallana.

Barcelona remain keen on Liverpool striker Luis Suarez but his bite on Georgio Chiellini has made Real Madrid shift uncomfortably and they will see how Fifa's disciplinary verdict unfolds and monitor the subsequent reaction.

Sevilla left-back Alberto Moreno looks increasingly like staying in Spain this season.

Talks
 over a move to Liverpool collapsed after Sevilla raised their valuation
 and Sevilla sporting director Monchi told El Correo del Andalusia: 'The
 matter of Alberto is practically settled.  We couldn’t reach an 
agreement and I don’t think it can be revived.

'It
 was great offer, but the player is only 21 years old and it’s possible 
that the catharsis of being with the national team had a positive 
effect.

'He has a lot of room to grow and the coach is very happy to 
have him.  I don’t think we’ll make a lot of moves, but if on August 14 a
 club comes along and gives you a mountain of cash, well ...I know you 
don’t like to hear it, but we are economic managers.

'My
 feeling is that the negotiations are paralysed and I don’t see any hint
 that they will be restarted. We put a price on our players which we 
believe to be appropriate.  Whoever wants to buy, can buy, and if you 
can’t…'

Monchi said he has 
yet to receive any offers for centre-back Federico Fazio who is a 
long-term target for Arsenal while Liverpool and Everton have shown an 
interest.

Swansea City are set to pay £72,000 to take Hull City starlet Daniel James to the Liberty Stadium.

The 16-year-old Wales youth international midfielder hails from the Hull area but believes he will have a better chance of a senior breakthrough at Swansea.

Swansea have a category two academy, and are aiming to achieve category one status, with youth manager Cameron Toshack looking to increase his squad.

Hull youth coach Tony Pennock, formerly Swansea's academy boss said: 'Everyone has got their own choices and decisions to make and I respect that. I wish Dan James all the very best. We're disappointed to lose them but I don't see that as recruitment. I see that as cherry picking.'

Crystal Palace will explore the possibility of signing Michu from Swansea City.

Manager Tony Pulis wanted the Spaniard while at Stoke City and is keen to see if the 28-year-old will consider a move to London.

Swansea are willing to sell with Napoli and Atletico Madrid interested but the main attention is coming from Michael Laudrup and his new club Lekhwiya in Qatar.

Pulis has looked at a deal for former Everton midfielder Diniyar Bilyaletdinov but Palace, Spartak Moscow and the player are understood to be some distance apart on the necessary figures.

Michu had an indifferent season last year but Pulis hopes a change of scenery could revitalise the Spaniard's goalscoring form.

Ashley Grimes is attracting interest from Northampton, Oxford and Cheltenham. The 27-year-old former Manchester United and City trainee has one year left on contract at Bury but they are willing to let him leave.

Aberdeen have also watched him in recent months while the likes of Carlisle and Morecambe have considered a move for a player who scored 22 goals from midfield for previous club Rochdale.

Hornet again: Watford have re-signed Matej Vydra (left), battling Pablo Zabaleta, on a season-long loan

Watford have announced they have 
re-signed striker Matej Vydra on a season-long loan from Udinese. The 
22-year-old Czech Republic international spent last season with West 
Brom, where he scored three goals in 23 Premier League appearances.

The 
previous season, he was prolific scoring 20 times in 41 Championship 
games.

West Bromwich Albion have had a bid rejected for highly-rated Dundee United left-back Andrew Robertson.

The Scotland international has been closely followed by Roberto Martinez at Everton and Southampton sporting director Les Reed among others. United manager Jackie McNamara said: 'It was nice to hear the chairman had knocked that back because Andy is a very good player and I want him here next season. I know the club doesn’t have to sell and the chairman’s decision confirms that.

'It doesn’t surprise me that other clubs are interested but we want to keep him.'
