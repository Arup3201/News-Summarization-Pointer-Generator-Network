For some pop stars, the most important requirement for their dog is that it can fit in a handbag. For Joss Stone, it's that it could 'eat somebody'.

The singer, who was the intended victim of a murder plot two years ago, has revealed how she has a pack of 'protective' dogs to make her feel safe.

Miss Stone, 26, already had a Rottweiler called Missy Elliott, and a teacup poodle called Dusty Springfield.

Singer Joss Stone bought more 'protective' dogs after being the subject of an intended murder plot. She is pictured with Igor (left) and Maggie and Missy (right)

Since the attempted attack, in which two men drove to her village in Devon armed with a samurai sword, she has bought a German Shepherd-collie cross, called Maggie, and Igor, a Caucasian Ovcharka - a large nocturnal breed often used as guard dogs.

She said: 'I wanted to have a protective dog because I had this murder thing happen.

‘But I was like ‘You know what, I’m not going to allow that to be a 
negative thing in my life.

‘In some way, somehow, it has become 
something positive.

‘I said I’m going to get puppies. And this is going to be the reason I get puppies. It’s a silver lining.

'I looked up the top ten protective dogs online. A big picture of a Caucasian Ovcharka came up.

'So I did my research on what they’re like with kids.

‘I got Igor when he was seven weeks old. Ovcharka’s are nocturnal, mainly, which is why he barks a lot at night.’

The singer reportedly paid £10m to buy her way out of a contract with EMI last year

Miss Stone told Dogs Today: 'Missy is my most protective dog. Dusty stays with me in my bedroom at night. Dusty sounds the alarm and Missy might eat somebody. Then Igor lives outside. They keep me at home.'

Earlier this year Kevin Liverpool, 35, and Junior Bradshaw, 32, were jailed for conspiracy to murder and rob Miss Stone.

They were apprehended, when they crashed their car then began asking the star’s neighbours where she lived, carrying a photograph of Miss Stone.

The pair intended to find Miss Stone’s home, rob her of £1m they believed she had in a safe, kill her and dump her body in a river.

Singer Miss Stone rose to fame in late 2003 with her multi-platinum debut album, The Soul Sessions, which made the 2004 Mercury Prize shortlist.

Last year, she reportedly paid record company EMI £10 million to buy her way out of her contract.

And she says that she has now turned her back on the potential of earning millions of pounds from recording and touring for a life of normality in the close-knit community where she grew up.
