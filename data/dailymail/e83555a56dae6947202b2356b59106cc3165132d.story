A California thief gave himself away by binge watching on his victim's Netflix account.

Bobby Alexander is behind bars after police used the information to trace the IP address leading them to the 20-year-old's home.

The unidentified victim says that it all started when she returned home to find someone had broken in and made off with her television, Blu-ray player, and other electronics.
