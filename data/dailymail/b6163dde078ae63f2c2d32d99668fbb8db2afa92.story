Louis van Gaal admitted that Manchester United 'did not play as a team' and bemoaned Manchester United's lack of top quality defenders following the shock defeat against Swansea on his competitive debut at Old Trafford.

Van Gaal became the first United manager to lose a home Premier League match on the opening day of the season after goals from Ki Sung-yueng and Gylfi Sigurdsson stunned a home crowd expecting life under the Dutchman to be a big improvement on last season's woes.

The 63-year-old former Ajax and Barcelona boss was even forced to ditch his much-hyped 3-5-2 formation at half-time with United struggling to create any chances. The team switched to a flat back four which included Tyler Blackett and Chris Smalling in central defence, Ashley Young at left back and Phil Jones at right back.

That switch resulted in an equaliser for Wayne Rooney but Swansea nicked the victory and Van Gaal was quick to point out that his team had to address their severe weaknesses in defence.

'We need defenders,' Van Gaal told BT Sport after the match. 'You cannot say because of one game we lost that it (the problem) is the defence - it is the team. We didn't play as a team. 

'We don't reach our level what we have shown in pre-season. We are disappointing in defence.

Van Gaal added: 'We are not reaching our level in our first home match and that is disappointing because this is the most important match, we must evaluate.'

'They have done their utmost best and you can see in the second half they have run the miles.

'We must keep our head up and use the second step in our process better than today.

'We were disappointing in defence and we are disappointed with ourselves and that's why we lost today.' 

Tall order: Chris Smalling was unable to prevent Manchester United losing and conceding two goals

Van Gaal would not divulge which players he wants to move on before the transfer window closes at the end of August. Instead he challenged his squad to prove they deserve a place in his regime at Old Trafford. 

'I have not made a decision on who goes - it is up to the players to decide too. I will never say to the players that you have to go.'Explaining his decision to change from his favoured 3-5-2 shape, Van Gaal said: 'I had decided to change formation in the first half because Swansea made the pitch big and 4-3-3 is a better formation to press with.' 

The Dutch boss, who has won league titles with every club side he has managed so far in his career, quickly batted away suggestions that the opening-day performance will have a big impact on his transfer plans.

 'No, because that is a short term assault I think, but of course we need defenders but I have already said that in former press conferences,' he added.

'You cannot say because of one game that we lost, and all the others we won, that it is the defence. It's the team.

'We never played as a team I think and that's our error and also we don't reach the required level and maybe because of that we haven't played like a team.'
