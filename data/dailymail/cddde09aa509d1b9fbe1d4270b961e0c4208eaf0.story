Dreams: In an interview 3 years ago, murder victim Chris Lane describes his love for the U.S.

An interview that murdered baseball player Chris Lane gave to a radio station in his native Australia has emerged, revealing his excitement at studying in the United States.

In the interview with Sports Central in Melbourne three years ago, the then-19-year-old gushed about his experiences as a budding baseball player while attending college in Oklahoma.

It is a state where, years later, would become the scene of his murder. On August 16, the student was gunned down as he went for a jog, allegedly by a group of teenagers who were 'bored'.

'I've only been over here for about two 
months now and I can honestly say I've enjoyed every minute of it,' Lane said in the interview. 
'It's certainly a great experience I'm having right now.'

Lane, who was 22 when he was killed, is extremely humble in the interview, which can be heard in full on NewsOK. He told the host he is in the U.S. because 'I was really lucky'.

'I'm the only one that's you know, 
studying in a foreign country and able to play a sport I love,' he said. 'If nothing, I'm going to gain an awesome
experience that I'm going to look back on for the rest of my life.'

Lane said he had been playing baseball since he was five but added that, while he loved the sport, he was concentrating on getting a thorough education in the U.S.

'Most important for me is to get the 
education and I have the bonus of being a student athlete... if I get my
education sorted then everything goes right,' he said.

The interview was carried out when he was at Redlands Community College, and he said that after two years there, he hoped to get into a four-year U.S. college - and maybe reach the major league.

'It would certainly be a dream,' he said. 'But you 
know, you can only work hard and I've got hopefully four years, fingers 
crossed over here, so there's plenty of opportunity to put my hand up 
and see how far I can go.'

In yet a further heartbreaking twist, he assured the host that the Americans loved having Australians in the country. The host concluded: 'We'll keep in touch with you over the next several years.'

After the interview, Lane was granted a scholarship to attend East Central University.

But on August 16, he was shot in the back and killed while jogging in Duncan, Oklahoma. Police believe he was picked randomly after the suspects said they were looking for something to do.

Police
have arrested James Francis Edwards Jr. 15, Chancey Allen Luna, 16, and
Michael Dewayne Jones, 17, in connection with the shooting.

At the weekend, hundreds of friends gathered on 'Laney's' field of dreams in Melbourne, where his sporting life as a catcher had begun.

Devastated relatives and friends released black and red balloons - the colors of the Essendon club where Lane had previously played - which were marked with his player's number, 40.

His girlfriend, 22-year-old Sarah Harper, flew from the US to be there for the tribute game and to join Chris's parents, Peter and Donna, his sisters, Erin, Andrea and Jennifer and Andrea's daughter.

Referring to the trauma that the Lane famiy faces as details emerge in the U.S. courts, Mr Lane said: 'Distance isn't going to change the size of the task ahead, but we still have three beautiful daughters and we have grandchildren.

'They need to pick themselves up each day and get on with their lives. Whatever task you need to do, you get up each day and you have to move forward.'

He and his wife, he said, had been moved by the 'tremendous tributes' to their son.

'So many people have been prepared to roll out and support him,' he said. 'He was much loved, but I have never doubted that for a minute.'

President Barack Obama has sent his thoughts and prayers to Chris' family, saying through a spokesman that 'there is an extra measure of evil in an act of violence that cuts a young life short'.
