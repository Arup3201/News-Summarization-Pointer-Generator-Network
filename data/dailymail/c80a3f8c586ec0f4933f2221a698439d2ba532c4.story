These are the amazing 'before and after' weight loss pictures of Obie the dachshund who found fame after tipping the scales at 77lbs.

The formerly obese dog showed off his remarkable 40lb weight loss in a series of pictures taken on a hike on Sunday with his owner Nora Vanatta. The little dog sprints along the trail - a remarkable difference considering several months ago he was barely able to move.

After dropping the pounds over an eight-month period, Obie had  surgery at an Oregon veterinary clinic that removed 2 1/2 pounds of loose skin that had been dragging along the ground.

Before: Obie could barely move after his owners fed him until he was obese

Obie now weighs about 35lbs. Fans have been following his 
weight loss ever since the first pictures of Obie when he was obese were posted on Facebook.

The dog was so overweight that he needed 
to wear a harness to stop his body dragging on the ground.

Obie was adopted by former veterinary technician Ms Vanatta after 
his elderly owners almost fed him to death.

But
Oregon Dachshund Rescue owner Jenell Rangan accused the woman of 
exploiting the dog for 'sensationalistic promotional value' and began 
fighting for custody.

Obie became a nationwide celebrity 
after appearing on TV shows such as 'Live With Kelly and Michael' and 
the Today Show with Ms Vanatta, who put him on a drastic diet.

A Facebook page that chronicled his weight loss now has 96,000 followers.

But the rescue centre claimed to be 
Obie's owner six months ago and in court papers filed on October 22 
accuses Ms Vanatta of 'wrongfully' holding the dog in an effort to get 
famous and pocket the donations that are flowing in to help pay for his 
care.

'They say I'm exploiting him,' Ms Vanatta told KATU.com last year. 'They say I'm misusing his funds and they claim he belongs to them.'

The
woman, who is now his permanent owner, collected thousands of dollars from Obie's supporters. But 
she insists that everything she's done was for the dog benefit.

Oregon Dachshund Rescue put out an online plea for help when they heard the dog was in need of a home.

A rescue centre volunteer picked up Obie from his former owners and delivered him to Ms Vanatta after she volunteered to help.

'He's famous and heâ€™s touched so many people and I think they regret not taking him on in the first place,' she said.

Dubbed
the world's fattest sausage dog, Obie found fame in September after Ms 
Vanatta put him on a drastic diet to try and get him back into shape.

Obie,
who was double the size of an average Dachshund, was nearly fed to death
by his doting elderly owners who had to give him up because of their 
deteriorating health.

A
Dachshund normally has a maximum weight of 32 pounds - a little over 
two stone - with Obie more than twice the size at the age of just five.

Ms Vanatta said: 'He arrived on August 18 and to my astonishment he was a dachshund and he actually weighed 77 lbs.

'He is extremely sweet and loving. He
was obviously loved and is a joy to work with. The aging owners just 
couldn't say no to those big brown eyes.

'But we are thrilled to be able to help him, and now moving on with his new life.'

Ms Vanatta,
who has a degree in animal science and is a certified veterinary 
technician, said the dog's staggering weight meant she was unable to take him out for exercise.

Instead, she resorted to a special diet and hydrotherapy in an attempt to shed the pounds.

Ms
Vanatta set up a Paypal page to encourage people to donate money to pay
for Obie's care and the donations have been flowing in.

When
she embarked on the project, she said: 'I feel tremendously blessed to 
be involved in his rehabilitation and I am amazed at the outpouring of 
love and support that I have received.

'My hope is that he can be an inspiration to any person or animal trying to lose weight.

'It is so important to introduce pups and kids to a healthy lifestyle and food choices as early as possible.'
