A cabal of police officers hatched the ‘Plebgate’ plot to ‘stitch up’ Tory chief whip Andrew Mitchell, a senior police officer has claimed.

The insider, said to be a serving superintendent, alleges that officers ‘orchestrated’ the downfall of the Cabinet minister after an incident the night before the actual clash between Mr Mitchell and police on duty at Downing Street on September 19 last year.

He claims that the previous evening Mr Mitchell jabbed a finger at an officer, demanding that he open the Downing Street gates as he cycled through.

'Stitched up': Former chief whip Andrew Mitchell on his bycycle. A police whisteblower has claimed the minister was the victim of an alleged plot by Met officers

The insider stated: ‘Following this 
[officer X] said to the other officers: “Right, we can stitch him up”.’

The word ‘plebs’ was then added by officer X to the police log of the 
conversation Mr Mitchell was said to have had with the officer guarding 
the gates on September 19, the whistleblower alleges.

Mr Mitchell was forced to quit after it was claimed he called police officers ‘plebs’, which he has hotly denied.

After
doubts emerged about the evidence against him, Scotland Yard began an 
inquiry. A statement from the superintendent has been given to the Met.

He
says he received the information about officer X from a superior, and 
does not have direct knowledge of the conspiracy he has outlined. 
Nonetheless, his account is being taken seriously by the Met.

The Crown 
Prosecution Service is expected to announce shortly if anyone will face 
charges over the affair.

A Scotland Yard inquiry into the affair has led to eight arrests, including five Met police officers for allegedly fabricating evidence or leaking to the media.

Confrontation: Andrew Mitchell is pictured on CCTV leaving Downing Street by a side gate. There is no sign of the passers-by said to have overheard him call police officers 'f******* plebs'

Guards: Two Met Police officers unconnected with the row at the front gates of Downing Street

Two bogus emails were sent to Mitchell's then deputy which claimed two people had overheard the exchange, but CCTV footage showed there was no-one passing at the time of the row.

A spokesman for the Metropolitan Police said: 'This has been a lengthy and complex investigation involving the supervision of the Independent Police Complaints Commission.

'Many lines of inquiry have been investigated and the final file is now with the Crown Prosecution Service who are considering all the evidence.'
