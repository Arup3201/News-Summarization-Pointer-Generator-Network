On any average day, the Honduran city of San Pedro Sula bears all the hallmarks of a war zone.

The mortuaries overflow with bullet-ridden bodies, the hospital emergency rooms are inundated with the wounded.

But for those people who call San Pedra Sula - recently crown the world's most violent city for the second year in a row - this is the daily reality of a region ripped apart by the drugs trade.

A collection of shocking photographs 
paints a truly gruesome picture of life in a city where vicious gangs 
and drug cartels who operate freely in an area of lawlessness, poverty 
and a decaying justice system.

Honduras's second largest city has at least three murders reported each day in the coffee-exporting nation.

Arms trafficking has flooded the 
country with nearly 70per cent illegal firearms - 83.4per cent of 
homicides are by firearms, compared to 60per cent in the United States.

Horrific: The feet of a dead man lying on a stretcher are seen inside the morgue with a bloodied gurney in the foreground

Gunmen have taken control of slums and villages, well aware that the police are ineffective and corrupt.

San Pedro Sula recorded 1,218 homicides in 2012 (a rate of 3.3 murders a day).

Reuters reported last year
 that San Pedro Sula is saddled with one of South America's weakest 
economies - and nearly 70 per cent of the population live in poverty.

Many see crime as their only option. Or they leave, making the long trek to the United States.

Gruesome: People peek into the emergency ward near the bloody legs of a woman who had been assaulted by her husband

Street
 gangs known as Maras have morphed into deadly organized crime 
syndicates, while Mexican drug traffickers buy up land and recruit their
 own squads of killers.

For 
those who run afoul of the law, justice can be a far horizon. Nearly 
half of the country's prisoners have not been convicted and many wait 
years before they even get a hearing.

Others
 die in jailhouse stabbings, shootings or fires like the one which 
surged through the Comayagua prison in February 2012, trapping prisoners
 in their cells who were burned alive.

A disturbing investigation by the 
Associated Press earlier this month found that rogue police death squads
 are operating with impunity across Honduras, taking the law into their 
own hands and acting as judge, jury and executioner.

Despite millions of dollars in U.S. 
aid to Honduras aimed at professionalising the country's police, the AP 
has learned in the past three-years, Honduran prosecutors have received 
as many as 150 formal complaints about death squad-style killings in the
 capital of Tegucigalpa, and at least 50 more in the economic hub of San
 Pedro Sula.

The country's 
National Autonomous University, citing police reports, has counted 149 
civilians killed by police in the last two years, including 25 members 
of the notorious 18th street gang.

Overrun: Family members of patients sleep in a corridor of the emergency ward. Arms trafficking has flooded the country with nearly 70 per cent illegal firearms

Police
 have long been accused of operating more like assassins than law 
enforcement officers in Honduras, but few cases ever have been 
investigated.

In the past 
year, police were alleged to have been involved in the deaths of a 
prominent Honduran radio journalist and the son of a former police chief
 - but neither killing has been solved.

Even the country's top police chief has been charged with being complicit.

In
 2002, a police internal affairs report accused then police prison 
inspector Juan Carlos Bonilla of three extrajudicial killings - and 
linked him to 11 more deaths and disappearances that it said were part 
of a police policy of 'social cleansing.'

He
 was tried and acquitted on one of the three charges. The head of 
internal affairs unit who produced the report, Maria Luisa Borjas, was 
expelled from the department, and the rest of the cases, like most 
crimes in Honduras, were not investigated.

Last year, Bonilla was chosen to lead the national police force despite unanswered questions about his past.

The
 U.S. Congress decided to withhold State Department funding to the 
police while they investigated the 2002 internal affairs report.

Roberta
 Jacobson, assistant secretary of state for western hemisphere affairs, 
said last week that the department is constantly reviewing information 
about people and institutions receiving support in Honduras, and so far,
 the state department can and will continue funding and training the 
Honduran police.

Plague of killings: The covered-up body of a young man shot dead along a rural lane. Honduras's second largest city has at least three murders reported each day

Grief: People carry a coffin for a family member who had died a violent death, outside a local hospital in San Pedro Sula

All but 
about $11million has since been released based on a Congressional 
agreement with the State Department over how counter-drug operations 
involving the U.S. and investigations into civilian casualties are 
carried out.

'It has been 
made clear to the State Department that no units under General Bonilla's
 control should receive U.S. assistance without credible information 
refuting the serious allegations against him,' said Sen Patrick Leahy, 
chairman of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on the State 
Department and Foreign Operations.

As far back as 1988, the 
Inter-American Court on Human Rights condemned Honduras for failing to 
document the fate of detainees and for allowing police to obstruct 
judges investigating cases, 'including threatening them and denying the 
disappearances.'

Bonilla was
 appointed police chief last May after his predecessor, Gen. Ricardo 
Ramirez del Cid, was ousted amid charges that police were involved in 
the kidnapping and the killing of one of Honduras' best-known 
journalists, Alfredo Villatoro.

Honduras
 made a failed attempt to purge its National Police of corrupt officers 
after some were implicated in the 2011 murder of the son of Julieta 
Castellanos, rector of the National Autonomous University of Honduras.

Between
 May and November, hundreds of police officers underwent background 
checks and polygraphs. By the end of the year, 33 of them were removed, 
but the Constitutional Court stopped the purge, ruling that it violated 
officers' rights.
