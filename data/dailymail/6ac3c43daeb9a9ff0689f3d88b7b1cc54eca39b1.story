The live-in boyfriend of troubled country singer Mindy McCready shot himself in his Arkansas home on Sunday night, it was revealed today.

New sheriff reports reveal that David Wilson, 34, was found in his house in Heber Springs with a self-inflicted gunshot wound and he was transported to the local hospital but declared dead shortly after.

Singer McCready, who has publicly struggled with drug problems, described her live-in boyfriend as her 'soul mate' and 'life partner' as she announced his death on Sunday.

Mourning: David Wilson, seen here with his country singer girlfriend Mindy McCready, was found with a gunshot wound on Sunday night and pronounced dead hours later

'Life partners': McCready, 37, and Wilson, 34, lived together in a home owned by a Wilson relative

The official Cleburne County Sheriff's department confirmed to MailOnline that police and emergency services responded to a call at approximately 6.15pm on Sunday though it is unclear who made the call.

The house is the same one where McCready was discovered hiding in a closet in December 2011 with her elder son Zander after a nationwide manhunt as part of a long custody dispute.

Zander was taken from McCready's arms and placed in foster care.

McCready's mother and step-father had legal custody of him at the time, following McCready's lengthy and public battle with drug addiction.

Custody: Mindy had been fighting for custody rights over her elder son Zander (pictured) for years and allegedly was just awarded the landmark decision

It's unclear whether Zander is living 
with McCready, if he has been returned to his grandparents and if he 
remains in foster care.

Wilson is the father of McCready's younger son, Zayne, who was born in April.

'Today, we mourn the loss of my life partner and my children's father, David Wilson,' McCready said in a statement she released.

'David was my soulmate; he was a caregiver and guiding hand to our sons, Zander and Zayne.

'Mindy is in no condition to to be talking right now. She's too upset.'

      -- Mindy McCready's brother Joshua

'He
 was a precious gift from God to all of us and, yesterday, he returned 
home and is now with his mother and father. David loved and he was 
loved.

'Those who knew and
 loved him will miss him; those who did not know David missed the 
opportunity to know a truly loving and gifted man.'

The police report says that emergency services arrived at Wilson's house on Fox Chase Road at 6.15pm and transported him to nearby Baptist Hospital, where he was pronounced dead at 8pm.

No criminal charges have been filed but the investigation is ongoing.

Speaking to MailOnline, Mindy's brother Joshua said that she was too upset to talk to anybody.

He said: 'She's going through a lot right now. What happened was tragic, there's no doubt about it.

In the business: Wilson ran Dave Wilson Productions and was also a songwriter

Too young: Wilson was only 34-years-old when he was found dead on Sunday, and he was the father of Mindy's 9-month-old son Zayne

Picturesque: Wilson was found shot in the home he and Mindy shared on Fox Chase Road in Eden Isle neighborhood just off Greers Ferry Lake in Arkansas

'I knew David pretty well. Mindy is in no condition to to be talking right now. She's too upset.

'She is being looked after by relatives'.

Fatal: The nature of his self-inflicted gunshot wound has not been revealed and the investigation is ongoing

Mindy's father Timothy said that the family were still coming to terms with their loss.

'Thank you so much for calling but it's way too soon and there's too much going on,' he said.

'It's just too soon. We're still dealing with it.'

The house on Fox Chase Road became the center of the custody battle between Mindy and her parents after she kidnapped her elder son and hid out in the house that was then-owned by her father Timothy McCready. News reports said at the time that neither she nor Wilson- who was found in the house with her- were allowed to be on the property.

The house has since legally changed hands, and is now owned by a relative of Wilson's. 

Wilson is said to be a record producer and songwriter, though it is unclear who he worked with specifically.

McCready
 rose to fame in 1996 with her hit country song 'Ten Thousand Angels.' 
Her album of the same name went double platinum - though that marked the
 peak of her career.

She struggled with arrests and drug addition after her career began to faded in the late 1990s.

She
 was dropped by BNA Records in after her 1999 album had disappointing 
sales and then dropped by Capitol Records in after her 2002 record 
suffered the same fate.

She was arrested in Tennessee in 2004 and pleaded guilty to using a fake prescription to buy the painkiller OxyContin.

Criminal record: Mindy McCready has been arrested multiple times- for a probation violation in 2005 (left), for allegedly assaulting her mother in 2007 (center) and for a probation violation shortly after that (right)

Troubled: Mindy McCready, 37, has waged a public battle with drug addiction since her career peaked in 1996

She
 was arrested in Nashville in May 2005 for drunk driving and driving 
with a suspended license after she was stopped for speeding. Two months 
later, she was charged with identity theft, unlawful use of 
transportation, unlawful imprisonment, and hindering prosecution in 
Arizona.

She was arrested twice, in 2005, 2007 and 2008, for violating the term of her probation.

 was a precious gift from God to all of us and, yesterday, he returned 
home and is now with his mother and father. David loved and he was 
loved'

In July 2007, she was arrested in Fort Myers, Florida and charged with with fighting with her mother.

In
 2005 and 2008, she was hospitalized for attempting suicide. She was 
taken to the hospital in 2010 for a drug overdose, as well.

McCready
 has been mounting a comeback in recent years, though. Her 2010 album 
'I'm Still Here' was praised by critics for McCready's vocal prowess.

She also appeared on Celebrity Rehab with Dr Drew as she attempted to work out her drug issues.

Hard life: McCready has been arrested numerous times - including once for drunk driving and once for drugs

On the show's website, VH1 made references to her personal problems and even pegged the root of her troubles on her relationships.

Her biography on the show's page says: 'Although she was arrested and jailed for trying to buy OxyContin with a false prescription and attempted suicide with an overdose of drugs and alcohol, Mindy believes her only true addiction is to violent relationships.'
