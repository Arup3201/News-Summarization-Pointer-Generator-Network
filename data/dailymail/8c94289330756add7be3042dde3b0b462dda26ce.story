Immigration dockets are so backlogged, a Virginia judge is setting court dates for illegal children for four years from now.

CNS News reports that Arlington, Virginia, Judge John M. Bryant told at least three minors appearing before his court on Tuesday morning that their next hearing would be June 11, 2018.

'Are you available that day?' Bryant reportedly asked one of the immigrant's lawyers as a joke.

Immigration courts are so backlogged that they are scheduling hearings for newly arrived illegal immigrant children for up to four years from now

'I don’t have my 2018 calendar in front of me, but yes, I believe so,' the lawyer told him.

'Okay, good. Have a good school year,' Bryant told the minor, a 17-year-old boy named Christian. 'I’ll see you in a few years, okay?'

With 375,000 immigration cases stuck on judges' dockets, illegal immigrants of all ages are routinely made to wait years for a full hearing. The average processing time for a case now stands at 520 days, according to Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse.

The Justice Department recently instituted a policy requiring courts to give children immigrants their initial hearing within three weeks of their arrival in the U.S. in an effort to try to get the process moving more quickly.

But the deluge of immigrant children entering the country illegally with or without a guardian still has courts tied in knots.

In the case of the Virginia court observed by CNS News, the judge was spent just four minutes a piece on each minor and was still only able to make it through 35 cases that morning.

A reporter for The Heritage Foundation's The Daily Signal who observed the same courtroom in mid-August said the judge made it through 38 names the day he was there.

By comparison, roughly 250 unaccompanied minors were illegally entering the country each day at the beginning of this summer. The U.S. predicts that by the end of this month, as many as 90,000 immigrant children, many of whom are from Central America, will have arrived since last year.

According to data from the Executive Office for Immigration Review, the court system has just 243 immigration judges at present.

President Barack Obama has requested emergency funds from Congress to pay for more immigration judges and other immigration-related expenses, but the House and the Senate were unable to come to an agreement on how much money to appropriate to the problem before they left for the summer break.

Lawmakers will return to Washington, D.C. next week, however they will have just 12 work days to hash out their differences on the immigration spending bill and a host of other issues before closing up shop again until after November's elections.

Immigrant children are sent to public school while they away their hearing dates. Educating illegal immigrant children will cost an estimated $761 million this year

Judges could make the immigration process go faster by issuing deportation notices to illegal children who don't show up for their initial hearings, but they often don't given how little warning minors are now given before their court dates.

'It's just not efficient to go so fast that challenges can be made to the due process,' immigration judge Dana Leigh Marks told the Associated Press at the end of July.

'It ends up making the cases take longer overall and results in longer appeals, so no one is happy,' she said.

Furthermore, government officials are prohibited from deporting illegal children as soon as they enter the country unless they are from Canada or Mexico.

House Republicans passed legislation last month that would amend the law to allow Central American children to be immediately sent home. There's little to no chance that the Democratic-led Senate will take up the measure, though.

Without additional funding from Congress or a change in the law, immigration courts could continue to be jam-packed for years.

In the meantime, illegal immigrant children are released back to their parents or guardians and sent off to school at the expense of the school district's taxpayers.

The Federation for American Immigration Reform estimates that 37,000 unaccompanied minors enrolled in school this fall and will cost schools $761 million this year to educate.

Residents of New York, Texas, Virginia, Maryland, Florida, California and New Jersey will pay the biggest price, FAIR says. Those seven states will be on the hook for more than $50 million a piece this year to educate illegal immigration children. New York alone will be responsible for $147.7 million of the total amount.

Educators are unable to turn away students simply because they know or suspect they are illegal immigrants.

The Supreme Court has ruled that public schools cannot require children to provide proof of citizenship in order to enroll.

In May the Departments of Justice and Education sent a joint memo to teachers reminding them of the rules as Attorney General Eric Holder announced that the Justice Department would do 'everything it can' to make sure students of all origins are receiving equal protection under the law.

Soon after, schools began publicly complaining about the crippling costs associated with educating illegal children.

One Massachusetts town said double the number of foreign born students have enrolled in its educational system throughout the last two years than did before.

This school year the town's educational system took on more than 600 new foreign students, 248 of whom were from Guatemala, it's mayor, Judith Flanagan Kennedy, said.

Roughly half of the Guatemalan children who enrolled in the Lynn, Massachusetts school district,126, are known to be illegal immigrants, Kennedy told Fox 25.

Kennedy noted that 'it's gotten to the point where the school system is overwhelmed, our health department is overwhelmed, the city's budget is being sustainably altered in order of accommodate all of these admissions in the school department.'

The school district's superintendent told Fox 25 that the influx of students has created overcrowding, and the district is having to spend it's limited financial resources on hiring more teachers and paying for the necessary vaccinations for newly enrolled students.

'The way this is going, Lynn looks like a microcosm of the United States, in that we have been filled to capacity and we can't take anymore without having the people who are already here suffer,' Kennedy said.
