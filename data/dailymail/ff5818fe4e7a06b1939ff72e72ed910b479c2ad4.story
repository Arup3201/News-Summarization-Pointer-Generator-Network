Spencer Matthews is back in the best shape of his life following a week on a gruelling army-style boot camp.

The 26-year-old Made In Chelsea star showed off his impressive six-pack while out hiking at the No 1 Boot Camp in Marrakech.

Former lothario Spencer was determined to get toned for the next series of the E4 reality show which starts again on April 13.

Spencer Matthews headed to the No 1 Boot Camp in Morocco with his girlfriend Lauren Frazer-Hutton

So he booked himself in to the boot camp which offers intensive daily military-style fitness sessions. And it has clearly paid off by the looks of his rippling pecs, biceps and abs.

Spencer took his girlfriend of five months, Lauren Frazer-Hutton, on the trip - and in the mornings the couple would work-out with a group of 12 other campers staying at the luxury villa.

They would take part in grueling sessions of cardio workouts, weights and circuits. 

In the afternoons they would often go on long romantic hikes together in the foot-hills of the Atlas mountains only coming back to the villa for the evening meal. 

Temperatures in Morocco got up to 20C and so Spencer was often seen walking around with his top off, whilst Lauren wore a pretty pink crop top.

Spencer and Lauren flew out to Morocco last week and stayed at the boot camp’s luxury five-star villa just outside Marrakech.

Every morning they were woken at 6am and had an hour of exercise before breakfast. At 8.30am they would have an hour and a half of cardio training – boxing or spinning, followed by a snack at 10am, then circuit training at 10.30am until 12.

Lunch would be an hour and then they would have long hikes, followed by team games and then yoga and stretching exercise. The evening meal would follow at 7.30pm.

Despite their tiring work outs Spencer still found time to have a bit of a laugh on the mouthain

All the meals were prepared fresh on site each day and were all local produce and organic. 

Breakfast would consist of eggs, fresh fruit salad, with a small glass of freshly squeezed orange juice.

A typical lunch would be fish or chicken brochettes cooked on the BBQ and a selection of salads, and dinner would be a soup and a chicken tagine, all served by the villa’s waiting staff.

The calorie intake for each day would be limited to around 1,200 Kcal and the output of exercise around 2,000 Kcal, and generally most camper lose around 9lbs over the week.

Back at the luxury villa and Spencer seemed happy to show off his toned torso

Both Spencer and Lauren were committed to making the most of their time at camp and attended all of the sessions which were run by former RAF Physical Training Instructor Andy Morris. 

At the end of his stay Spencer was back in to his amazing Men’s Health cover shape, which he achieved back in December 2013.

When at the camp Spencer tweeted: 'Getting hammered (not the good kind) @no1bootcamp Marrakech with little @iamlaurenhutton. This stuff works! Hard work pays off. #FitA**' 

Previously Spencer has been known to party hard but he’s not drinking at all at the moment because he wants to get in great shape.

And Lauren sent an Instagram message saying: 'Happiest when in the sun & with this one @spencermatthews.'

Spencer previously went to the Ibiza branch of No 1 Boot Camp in October, he worked off his pudgy tummy and uncovered his six pack.
