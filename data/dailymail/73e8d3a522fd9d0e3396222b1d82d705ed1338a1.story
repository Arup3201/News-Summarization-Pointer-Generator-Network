U.S. President Barack Obama today struck a landmark deal with China that would see both countries significantly reduce their greenhouse gas emissions over the next three decades.

Under the agreement, America pledged to cut between 26 and 28 per cent of the level of its carbon emissions set in 2005 by 2025 as part of the global fight against climate change.

But Chinese President Xi Jinping simply said he would aim to  cap his country's emissions by 2030 - still an unprecedented move by a nation that has been reluctant to box itself in on global warming.

In order to successfully accomplish this,  20 percent of China's energy needs will come from alternative sources, such as solar power and wind energy, by that year, the politician said.

Speaking beside Xi in Beijing today, Obama declared: 'This is a major milestone in the U.S.-China relationship. It shows what's possible when we work together on an urgent global challenge.'

Despite the agreement, many have called into question the feasibility of the presidents' goals - with Obama's pledge likely to confront tough opposition from ascendant Republicans in Congress.

Republicans signaled  they would seek to thwart Obama's efforts once the GOP controls the Senate next year, pointing out that the president was saddling future leaders with a tough-to-meet goal.

'This unrealistic plan, that the president would dump on his successor, would ensure higher utility rates and far fewer jobs,' said incoming Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky.

However, a senior White House official called the deal both 'ambitious and achievable' - with Obama ultimately aiming to 'achieve deep economy-wide reductions on the order of 80% by 2050'.

'Congress may try to stop us, but we believe that with control of Congress changing hands we can proceed with the authority we already have.' the official told CNN.

Shaking hands: Under the agreement, made in Beijing today, America pledged to cut between 26 and 28 per cent of the level of its carbon emissions set in 2005 by 2025 as part of the global fight against climate change

'Milestone': Speaking beside Xi in Beijing today, Obama (pictured) declared: 'This is a major milestone in the U.S.-China relationship. It shows what's possible when we work together on an urgent global challenge'

'This is really the crusade of a narrow group of people who are politically motivated and have made this a cause celebre, but we believe we will be successful.' 

The official did not say whether Obama would propose legislation or use his executive powers to enact changes without lawmakers. Still, these orders could be changed under a new president.

The agreement, which aims to inject fresh momentum into the climate change battle ahead of make-or-break climate talks next year, was unveiled on the last day of Obama's trip to China.

Many claimed it reflected both nations' desire to display a united front that could blunt arguments from developing countries that have balked at demands that they get serious about global warming.

The U.S.'s target to reduce its emissions of heat-trapping gases by 26 percent to 28 percent by 2025 is a sharp increase from Obama's earlier vow to cut emissions by 17 percent by 2020.

However, China, whose emissions are still growing as it builds new coal plants, did not commit to cut emissions by a specific amount.

Rather, Xi set a target for China's emission to peak by 2030, or earlier if possible. He also pledged to increase the share of energy that China will derive from sources other than fossil fuels.

'This is, in my view, the most important bilateral climate announcement ever,' said David Sandalow, formerly a top environmental official at the White House and the Energy Department.

'It sends the signal the two largest emitters in the world are working together to address this problem.'

Obama's target, expected to serve as the U.S. contribution to a worldwide treaty to be finalized next year in Paris, came months before it had been expected.

The U.S. has sought to show aggressive action on climate change in order to spur other nations to offer ambitious contributions, too.

For China, the commitment to cap emissions marked a turning point in China's evolution on global warming and its responsibility to deal with the problem.

China accounts for around 30 percent of global emissions, but has only gotten serious in recent years as the large-scale impact on health and quality of life in China has come into focus, exacerbated by smothering smog in Beijing's skies.

Environmental advocates in the U.S. heralded the announcement as a game-changer that would undermine opposition. If China can get serious about emissions, they said, surely others can, too.

Al Gore, former vice president and a leading advocate for limiting climate change, called the announcement 'a major step forward in the global effort to solve the climate crisis'.

He said more will be required — 'including a global agreement from all nations — but these actions demonstrate a serious commitment by the top two global polluters.'

Senator Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., who chairs the Senate's environmental panel, added: 'Now there is no longer an excuse for Congress to block action.'
