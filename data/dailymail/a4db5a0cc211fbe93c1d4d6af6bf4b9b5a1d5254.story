Florida Sen. Marco Rubio now says he would be 'open' to blocking a pathway to citizenship for immigrants who entered the country improperly.

While he continues to favor legislation that would create opportunities for illegal immigrants to become U.S. citizens, Rubio told the New York Times that he would be willing to entertain legislation that allows for permanent residency but not citizenship in order to get conservatives on board with changes to the current system.

'We might prohibit people who came here illegally and got green cards under this process from ever becoming citizens. And if that’s what we have to do to get this thing passed, I would be open to it,' he told the Times during an interview published on Wednesday.

'But I don’t think that’s a wise thing to do,' he added.

As a freshman senator Rubio, the son of Cuban immigrants, embraced the issue of immigration and joined onto efforts to pass comprehensive reforms led by a bipartisan group of senators known as the Gang of Eight that included Republican Sens. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and John McCain and Jeff Flake of Arizona.

The bill passed in the Democrat-controlled Senate in mid 2013 but never made it the floor of the House before the end of the 113th session of Congress.

Confronted with the political reality that comprehensive reform won't pass the GOP-run House of Representatives, Rubio has since withdrawn his support for a comprehensive bill and has latched on to the piecemeal approach touted by House Speaker John Boehner.

'An "all or nothing" strategy on immigration reform would result in nothing,' Rubio's spokesman, Alex Conant, told ABC News last year. 

'What is keeping us from progress on a series of immigration issues on which there is strong consensus is the fear that a conference committee on a limited bill will be used to negotiate a comprehensive one. We should take that option off the table so that we can begin to move on the things we agree on,' he said.

At a gathering of conservative activists in August, Rubio made a similar point after he was heckled by immigration advocates who accused him of wanting to deport them.

'I’ve been there, I tried it, it doesn’t work. You are not going to have the support in Congress for the sort of comprehensive approach they’re insisting upon,' he told a reporter for U.S. News.

'And I think the approach they’ve taken, that they have some sort of right, is the wrong approach. I actually think it sets back the cause,' he said.

Conant confirmed to DailyMail.com today that the senator 'stands by' the principles in the Gang of Eight bill and believes that immigration reform legislation should include language that allows 'qualifying illegal immigrants' to obtain green cards and eventually become U.S. citizens.

Rubio would, however, be more strict with the qualifications for permanent residency, Conant explained, stressing that the Senate's immigration bill was compromise legislation. 

And 'if it's impossible to pass that sort of reform, he would be open to reform that allowed for permanent residence but not citizenship for illegal immigrants,' Conant said.

Illegal immigrants with serious criminal histories and those who arrived in the last several years would not qualify under the law and would be subject to immediate removal.

While Rubio would like to see Congress take on immigration on the next legislative session, the possible presidential candidate poured cold water on the notion that the Republican Party must pass immigration reforms before 2016 in order to remain political viable in that year's elections.

'Those who argue that this will be a bonanza for Republicans are not telling the truth,' the Florida senator told the New York Times. 'Those who argue that we should do it for the purpose of politics are also misanalyzing the issue'

Rubio's comments were an direct jab shot across the bow at pundits and lawmakers, like fellow Gang of Eight member Graham, who have argued that in order to woo the growing Hispanic-American population, the Republican Party must embrace immigration reform.

'If we don't at least make a down payment on solving the problem and rationally dealing' with the roughly 11 million illegal immigrants residing in the country, 'if we become the party of self-deportation in 2015 and 2016, then the chance of winning the White House I think is almost nonexistent,' Graham said on CNN's State of the Union last Sunday. 

Graham lauded former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush's foray into the 2016 presidential race, calling him an 'excellent candidate' who has 'rational, logical views on immigration.'

'This primary is wide open,' though, he said.

Rubio told the Times that he was still 'weighing' his own presidential campaign and repeated previous claims that friend and fellow Floridian Bush's entry into the race would have no effect on his decision.

'If I don’t run, it won’t be because Jeb is running,' he said. 'Maybe if you’re going to run for county commissioner or to be on the Mosquito Abatement Board or something like that, you may not want to run against a friend of yours,' he said.

'We certainly know a lot of the same people; we also know some different people. I don’t believe if I decide to run for president that that will be an impediment,' Rubio said in a separate NPR interview that also came out today.

As far as an announcement is concerned, Rubio told NPR that he is 'closer to a decision than we were a month ago' but gave no indication of which way he is leaning.
