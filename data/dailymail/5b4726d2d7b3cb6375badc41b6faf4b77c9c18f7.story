Business Secretary Vince Cable says headhunters should submit all-women shortlists of candidates for top jobs to solve Britain¿s chronic shortage of female executives

Headhunters should submit all-women shortlists of candidates for top jobs to solve Britain’s chronic shortage of female executives, Vince Cable said yesterday.

Just one in five top jobs in the FTSE index of the UK’s 100 biggest public companies are held by women.

Yesterday the Business Secretary slammed Glencore Xstrata, the mining giant, for failing to have even a single woman in its boardroom.

It is the only company left in the FTSE 100 to still be an all-male club, but has finally pledged to sold the problem by hiring a female director by the end of the year.

Speaking to Woman’s Hour on Radio 4, Mr Cable said the lack of women at Glencore is ‘a bit of a disgrace, to be frank’.

Later, when asked about headhunters being able to put forward all-women shortlists, he said: ‘You know, we’d like to see that happening.’

Under the Government’s voluntary code, 25 per cent of directors in the FTSE 100 should be women by 2015.

When Lord Mervyn Davies established the code in 2011, the figure was just 12.5 per cent, but the latest figures show it has jumped to 20.7 per cent.

The attitude of some senior men to female colleagues offers an insight into why so many women are being held back in their careers, and doing jobs which are beneath them.

Just four years ago, there were 21 companies in the FTSE 100 which had no women in their boardroom, compared to only one today.

Simon Murray, the former Glencore chairman, said in 2011: ‘Women are quite as intelligent as men.

‘They have a tendency not to be so involved quite often and they’re not so ambitious in business as men because they’ve better things to do.

In March, a report, commissioned by the Government, said all shortlists should include the name of at least one ¿strongly recommended woman¿. File picture

‘Quite often they like bringing up their children and all sorts of other things.

‘All these things have unintended consequences. Pregnant ladies have nine months off.

‘Do you think that means that when I rush out, what I’m absolutely desperate to have is young women who are about to get married in my company, and that I really need them on board because I know they’re going to get pregnant and they’re going to go off for nine months?’

Mr Cable said the changes at Glencore are ‘long overdue’, but went onto criticise the firm for the fact that it has ‘consistently failed to act’.

He said: ‘The vast majority of Britain’s top companies have got the message that a diverse top management team is good for business.

‘It is simply not credible that one company cannot find any suitable women.’

In March, a report, commissioned by the Government, said all shortlists should include the name of at least one ‘strongly recommended woman’.

The report, written by the headhunter Charlotte Sweeney, also called for further investigation into the legality of putting forward women-only shortlists for jobs.

The Equalities and Human Rights Commission is currently investigating the ‘legality’ of such lists, already used by the Labour party for selecting new MPs.

The commission expects to publish its guidance this summer.
