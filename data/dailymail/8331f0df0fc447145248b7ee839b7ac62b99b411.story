Sunderland boss Gus Poyet has been charged with improper conduct by the Football Association following his touchline tantrum and spat with Steve Bruce during Tuesday’s 1-1 draw at Hull.

The Black Cats boss was sent off by referee Mike Dean for kicking over a cooler box in protest at Jack Rodwell’s booking for diving before he clashed with his opposite number.

Poyet, who has until 6pm on Monday to respond, sarcastically applauded in Bruce’s face and goaded him with a comment which the Hull manager later said was ‘not very pleasant’.

Bruce was only kept from getting to Poyet by the intervention of assistant referee Stuart Burt.

But now the Uruguayan looks set to be hit with a touchline ban following the FA charge.

Sunderland have also been fined £25,000 after six of their players were booked, including Lee Cattermole who picked up a two-game ban following his 10th yellow of the season.

Poyet refused to apologise for his behaviour on Tuesday, and said: ‘Kicking a bottle of water is nothing serious.

‘I was not happy with Paul McShane (Hull defender) dancing like he was in the theatre, or like he’d been shot, and won a free-kick before that.

‘Jack then dived and got a free-kick against him, I just want fairness.

‘I have no regrets whatsoever. I now have to convince the officials not to put buckets of drinks around me.’

Bruce, has been reminded of his responsibilities.

An FA statement read: 'Sunderland manager Gus Poyet has been charged by the FA following the game against Hull City on 3 March 2015.

'It is alleged that his behaviour in the 35th minute of the fixture amounted to improper conduct.

'He has until 6pm on 9 March 2015 to respond to the charge.

'Meanwhile, Hull manager Steve Bruce has been contacted by the FA in relation to the same incident and formally reminded of his responsibilities.'
