When court staff in Glasgow were left disgusted by a mystery smell in the offices, they were determined to get to the bottom of what was causing it.

Workers at the Procurator Fiscal Office in the Scottish city spent two weeks investigating what was causing the stench, even enlisting the help of pest control workers and drainage experts.

Staff are believed to have spent a staggering £9,000 investigating the source, but were still none the wiser.

But the cause of the offending odour 
was eventually unmasked, when a disgruntled casual worker was caught 
with a can of joke shop fart spray.

Stench: Staff at the Procurator Fiscal office in Glasgow are believed to have spent a fortnight and £9,000 investigating a mystery smell in the office

It is believed that the worker had been refused an apprenticeship with the crown office, according to the Daily Record.

Sources believe that the worker was after revenge for the snub.

Cause: The stench is said to have been caused by a disgruntled casual worker with a can of joke shop fart spray

He is said to have been escorted from the building by security staff when he was found with the spray.

A source told the newspaper: 'It smelled like something had died under the floorboards.

'Various drainage experts and pest control folk were brought in to try and sort out the problem, but they all failed to find anything.

'Then on Wednesday this guy was caught with a can of fart gas and everything fell into place.'

A spokesman for the Crown Office said that workers had reported a strange smell.

He confirmed that the matter had been investigated but was now resolved.

The Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service (COPFS) is responsible for the prosecution of crime in Scotland, the investigation of sudden or suspicious deaths and complaints against the police.
