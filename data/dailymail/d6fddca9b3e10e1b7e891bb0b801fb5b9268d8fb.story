James Tomkins has accused Robin Van Persie of malicious intent after the Dutchman’s flailing arm knocked him to the ground in West Ham’s draw with Manchester United.

Tomkins ended the game with a broken nose after also being caught in the face by substitute Marouane Fellaini.

He had already taken a blow by Van Persie in the first half, who appeared to look over at the incoming defender before lashing out an arm.

Referee Mark Clattenburg only gave the Manchester United striker a talking to, but Tomkins claims there was more to it.

‘The nose is a bit swollen,’ Tomkins said in the aftermath of the 1-1 draw. ‘Fellaini was the second time in the match when I broke it. He has always got that about him when he goes up with his hands a lot.

‘It is tough to say that he does it deliberately, but with the Van Persie one, I think he had a look at me first and then he has gone for me. I think that was more malicious than the other one, even though I came out worse the second time.’

‘I think it was definitely a yellow at least, but I don’t like to say that someone should have got sent off. I am sure that there are challenges that I might make in the future that could be yellow or something else.’

Van Persie will not face retrospective action for the incident because it was clearly seen by Clattenburg who deemed it not worthy of a card.
