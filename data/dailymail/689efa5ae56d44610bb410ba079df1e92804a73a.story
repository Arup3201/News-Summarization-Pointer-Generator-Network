Bath expect Sam Burgess will need six weeks to recover from his broken cheekbone after an heroic, match-winning performance in Sunday's NRL Grand Final in Sydney which confirmed his place in rugby league folklore.

The 25-year-old, who moves to the rugby union side later this month, is due to have surgery, having suffered the injury in the first minute against Canterbury Bulldogs and gone on to play the full game.

He is scheduled to fly home next Wednesday to prepare for his cross-code move, but the timescale won’t be clear until after the operation.

The 25-year-old was given a hero's reception by fans at Redfern Oval after the Grand Final victory 

This was the scenario Bath would have feared — to see their high-profile new recruit suffer a setback just before joining them.

He was already facing a hasty education in the 15-man game in an attempt to force his way into England’s World Cup squad for next year’s tournament.

Now the learning process will have to start later than planned.

Last week, his new club released a video to herald his arrival and it ended with the date 25.10.14, which is when Toulouse visit The Rec in the European Champions Cup. However, it is understood that Burgess will just be introduced that day.

His five-year stint with the South Sydney Rabbitohs ended in glorious fashion, as he gallantly inspired the club’s first NRL title in 43 years — making 36 tackles and running 225 metres.

He was in tears at the end, before being chaired off the pitch and becoming the first non-Australian to win the Clive Churchill Medal as man of the match in a Grand Final. 

Asked about the injury at half-time, he blurted out: ‘It’s f*****. It’s gone.’ After the game, he added: ‘To be honest I couldn’t feel the pain. I knew I’d broken it straight away. My face felt numb and I had blurred vision.’

Burgess twin brothers — Tom and George — also made telling impacts as their mother Julie watched in the stands. George went off with concussion in the first half but returned to score a vital try.
