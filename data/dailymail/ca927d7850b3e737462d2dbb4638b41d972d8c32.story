A man accused of shooting a golfer that broke a window at his home with a stray ball pleaded guilty to battery with a deadly weapon.

Jeff Fleming of Reno, Nevada, entered the plea on Thursday in Washoe County District Court.

Fleming faces from probation to
10 years in prison and a $10,000 fine when he is sentenced on December 12.

He allegedly approached with a shotgun and fired once at the golfer, who was unable to find his ball while doing a drop shot on the 16th hole of Lakeridge Golf Course in September 2012,
prosecutors said.

Jeff Fleming, pictured, pleaded guilty to battery with a deadly weapon on Thursday. He was accused of shooting a golfer who broke a window in his home with a stray golf ball.

Fleming, 53, has expressed remorse and shock over his reaction to the
broken window, Deputy District Attorney Sean Neahusan said. Fleming apparently has no felony 
criminal record.

'I'm not sure what was going on, but from what I've read and heard, it definitely sounds out of character,' Neahusan said.

The golfer and his partner ran away after the shot was 
fired -- and it wasn't until they were safe that the golfer realized he had
been hit, according to police.

At least one shotgun pellet had to be removed from the golfer's body at a hospital. He was also treated for minor injuries to an arm 
and both legs.

In the wake of the shooting, the area around the 16th hole was evacuated. Fleming soon drove to his attorney's office, where he surrendered without 
incident.

'Live on a golf course and you got to expect your house to get hit 
every once in a while,' Neahusan said. 'This (shooting) 
is one of those stories that you just can't make it up.'

Neighbors who lived nearby were stunned, Neahusan said.

Neahusan also said he's unsure what motivated the shooting and referred 
queries about Fleming's mental state to his lawyer, Larry Dunn.

Dunn did not immediately return phone calls.

Because Fleming pleaded guilty, prosecutors agreed to drop an 
assault with a deadly weapon charge. Instead, they are going with the Division of
Parole and Probation's recommended sentence for him.
