New security footage released today raises the horrifying possibility that Paul Walker was trapped inside his car for up to a minute before the fireball which engulfed his Porsche Carerra GT took hold.

Contradicting previous reports that Walker's car exploded in flames on impact in Santa Clarita on Saturday, the video shows no smoke rising from the wreck in the immediate aftermath of the crash which claimed the Fast & Furious star's life and that of driver, Roger Rodas.

While the disturbing footage shot from the opposite side of the street does not show the accident, it does reveals what appears to be a significant smash as the car heavily knocks a tree and light pole followed by only wisps of smoke before the inferno erupts after two minutes.

Moment of impact: In the center of the image taken from a security camera opposite the crash scene where Paul Walker died a tree to the left of a light pole can be seen to waver - as Walker's Porsche Carerra GT hits

The footage, obtained by CNN, comes as investigators put a 'security hold' on preliminary findings of the autopsies of the remains of the two tragic victims.

However, the autopsies were completed on Tuesday, Los Angeles County Coroner Lt. Fred Corral said.

And as the investigation continues, exclusive photographs released to the MailOnline show Walker, 40, celebrating his brother Caleb's wedding as best man.

This was to be the last family wedding Paul, 40, would attend - and a stunning album of pictures by Chard photography gives a glimpse at the close-knit family who are now grieving following the actor's death in a car crash on Saturday.

In what would be some of the last photos ever taken of the star, Paul is seen posing with his fellow groomsmen at the wedding held on October 23 at Dove Canyon Country Club in Orange County, California.

The specter of Walker, 40, suffering 
in the moments after the crash comes as it was claimed the supercar in 
which the Hollywood star died in this week left professionals who tested
 it 'white' with fear and was branded 'the most dangerous car on the 
road' by a former manufacturer.

The 2005 Porsche Carrera GT was being 
driven by the Hollywood star's friend and business partner Roger Rodas 
when it crashed in Los Angeles on Tuesday, killing both of them.

It
 has since emerged that car experts have long expressed concern about 
the souped-up model's suitability for the road, due to its ultra light 
carbon-fiber frame and 5.7 liter race-derived V10 engine.

It has a flat out speed of 205 miles per hour and its design is derived from earlier Porsche Le Mans models.

Porsche knew of the car's sensitivity when they launched the model in 2004. According to TMZ,
 a memo circulated to sales staff said of the GT Carrera: 'This vehicle 
cannot drive over a Foster Beer can that is lying on its side.'

'You need to be aware of what type of road surface you are on (dips; pot holes, seam heights, etc.)

'The Carrera GT is as close to a racecar as we will ever get, this car has all the disadvantages of a racecar.

In
 a checkered past, the GT has been crashed by chat show legend Jay Leno,
 who lost control while speeding around a circuit in 2005.

Another
 incident in 2005 saw two sportscar enthusiasts Ben Keaton and Corey 
Rudl killed in a racetrack smash in California after the Carrera GT they
 were traveling in swerved into a concrete wall.

Too dangerous? Both professionals and engineers have voiced concern about the supercar's suitability for the road

Tragic: The aftermath of the car crash that killed Paul Walker showed the vehicle to be out of control. The car has a history of unpredictability, according to reports

In
 that case, Porsche paid a portion of the $4.5million compensation fee 
awarded to the family of Mr Rudl after it was established there were 
'handling problems' with the vehicle. 

And yesterday CCTV footage that revealed the precise moment that Paul Walker's Porsche Carrera GT careered into a tree and was released - as one witness claimed that the crash was an accident not a drag race.

The surveillance footage shot from a nearby rooftop camera and obtained by OMG! Insider shows a plume of black smoke billow into the sky after the crash, just moments before what appears to be a large detonation sends a huge fireball skywards.

And on Monday Walker's Fast & Furious co-star Vin Diesel joined crowds who'd gathered to pay their respects.

Speaking through a police car loudspeaker, he said: 'If my brother were here right now and saw all the love that you're bringing here. If he could see for himself that all of you have showed up to show my brother love at this hard time. That his family gets to see all of you show the love that you've shown Paul. It's going to stay with me forever.

'I just wanted to say thank you. Thank you for coming down here and showing that angel up in heaven how much you appreciate him. It's going to stay with me for ever.'

The footage of the deadly crash which claimed the lives of Walker, 40 and driver, Roger Rodas, 38, was released as images of the dramatic moment cops and emergency workers physically wrestled one of the Fast & Furious star's friends away from the scene also came to light.

And following the harrowing video and images, a professional driver who was at the charity show in Santa Clarita has come forward to claim that Rodas and Walker took their car out to check for a suspected mechanical issue and not for a joyride as has been claimed.

'As they were backing up the Carrera to put into the garage, it started stalling. I heard someone say, and I think it was Roger, "Why is the car stalling? Let’s take it around the block", the unidentified witness told Hollywood Reporter.

'Paul said, "Let me go with you really quickly".

'The whole premise of taking the car out for a drive was because something was wrong.'

The individual, who has declined to be named, said from his experiences with Walker and Rodas that the two were not likely to engage in a high-speed race with the Porsche Carrera GT - a car that is notorious for its handling issues at speed.

'These guys are business owners and Paul was a celebrity. They are responsible people. It was more like, 'What the hell is wrong with this car? Let’s see what’s wrong and go for a drive'.

'These guys were more like, 'That’s weird, the car is stalling, let’s figure it out.'

The dramatic images from the minutes after the crash show how Walker's friends arrived on the scene and desperately tried to put out the flames with fire extinguishers and reach their friend.

However, it is alleged that the situation was so hopeless that one of Walker's friends named Nute was so upset at being held back that he punched a firefighter - but was not charged by Sheriff's afterwards according to TMZ.Com

The 30-second video clip, obtained by OMG! Insider, also appears to show that there were no other cars in front or behind of Walker's Porsche in the seconds before the crash - adding to claims that he was not involved in a high-speed drag race before the incident.

Instead, it shows cars eventually rush to the scene as friends and passersby heard about the wreck.
