Jose Mourinho has criticised FIFA's 'Team of the Year' awards - by claiming they are bad for football.

Eden Hazard and Cesc Fabregas are the two Chelsea players who have been shortlisted for the accolade.

But Mourinho, speaking in his Friday press conference ahead of the trip to Sunderland on Saturday, said: 'When I see these trophies, I think they are not good for football. I don't care about it.

'Sometimes it seems we are looking for stars, people who are more important than other people and that is not the culture in this club.

'The mentality here is not to worry about that, even less be obsessed with that. When I see the names are Fabregas and Hazard, I think they don't think about it.

'They think about the team and try to win matches.' 

However, Mourinho was far more positive looking ahead to the match-up with Sunderland at the Stadium of Light which could see Chelsea move nine points clear at the top of the Premier League, at least temporarily.

He continued: 'People are confident and happy to play the way they're playing. It's good.

'(Complacency is) a risk we don't have. We have all the other risks - a bad period, injuries, unlucky matches, other teams' great evolution but complacency is not a risk we have.

'It is not the profile of this group. We were winning 5-0 against Schalke and in the 88th minute Eden Hazard made a sprint to defend.

'They've changed. There was a clear evolution in these young people.

'Yes, there's more to come. I think there is much more to come.

'It's a young team, with lots of young players. I have two more years of contract. They want to stay, I want to stay. We have a lot ahead of us.'

Chelsea have gone 19 games unbeaten so far this season in all competitions but records will not deter Gus Poyet and his Black Cats.

Sunderland ended Mourinho's 77-game unbeaten home record in the Barclays Premier League in April and also knocked them out of the Capital One Cup at the Stadium of Light last season.

But Mourinho is still positive. He said: 'There's been lots of water under the bridge since then. It's a difficult game.

'What happened last season was an isolated situation. I really believe that. I go to this game worried about many things but not about what happened last season.

'That match was impossible to win - but we move on. We are happy with the way we're doing things.'

Mourinho would not be drawn on whether or not Diego Costa is the best striker in the league

When asked if Diego Costa was the best striker in the Premier League, Mourinho refused to be drawn on such a debate. 

'I am not in favour of this kind of situation,' he said.

'In some cases it looks like we're doing a political campaign and I don't think it's a good way. Is he a top striker? Yes he is.' 

And the Portuguese is extremely impressed by the whole of his squad - including those who are not currently getting a run in the side.

He added: 'My untouchables now are the ones that are not playing. They are responsible for what we are doing. I do not have one who is not training hard, behaving well.

'Life is easy when you are always playing and winning and feeling high in your self-esteem. Life is difficult when you are not playing.

'Players were born to play. All these guys in my squad are fantastic.'

When asked why his squad is not picking up the injuries which appear to have ravaged the likes of Arsenal and Manchester United, Mourinho put it down to plain luck.

'We also struggle to keep them fit. We work hard and try our best. It is a bit of everything including luck. You need luck.

'Things can change very quick. We are not in a position to say we do not care about certain competitions.

'For us, every compn is important and every match important. We try to play with our best team. We need a bit of luck also.'
