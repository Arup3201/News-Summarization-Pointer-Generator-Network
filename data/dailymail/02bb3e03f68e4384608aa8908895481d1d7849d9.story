Brian Galea, pictured with his wife Michelle, died after a surgeon accidentally tore an artery while trying to remove a blog clot in his lung

As he waited patiently for a CT scan in hospital, Brian Galea was able to while away the time chatting and sharing sweets with his family.

Minutes later, the father-of-three was dead after a surgical procedure went catastrophically wrong, an inquest heard.

Mr Galea, 47, died after an attempt to remove a blood clot using a suction machine tore his pulmonary artery, causing blood to pour into his lungs. He swallowed half a litre.

His wife Michelle and their daughters Antonia, 22, and Francesca, 27, could hear Mr Galea coughing up blood through the door of the X-ray room before there was silence. He died a few minutes later.

Coroner Dr James Adeley condemned the decision to use a mechanical thrombectomy to remove the clot and said the high-risk procedure should have been avoided.

His family plan to sue the hospital trust and have reported the case to police. It is also likely to be referred to the General Medical Council.

Mrs Galea, 47, said: ‘The devastation this has caused our family cannot be put into words. Quite simply, my husband’s life was taken from him.’

Mr Galea, who ran his own business working with BMW dealerships, had previously had surgery to remove a benign pituitary tumour.

The procedure on 47-year-old Mr Galea was carried out at the Royal Preston Hospital (pictured)

On August 14 last year he was admitted to the Royal Preston Hospital with breathlessness, chest pains and low blood pressure following a bout of pneumonia.

Large blood clots were diagnosed early on and he was due to have a CT scan to locate the blockages.

But on his way to the scan he was intercepted by a medic who insisted he had a pulmonary embolism and needed to have an emergency procedure immediately.

Mrs Galea said: ‘We can’t understand how this could have happened. He had been chatting normally and enjoying eating Haribo sweets before he was wheeled in for his CT scan.

‘This member of staff advised us that if Brian did not have this urgent procedure he could have a heart attack or suffer a stroke. It was the first time in our lives that I had ever seen Brian look terrified.

‘When my children and I were then told that he had died we screamed in utter shock and disbelief.

The room in which Brian had the procedure was left with a large pool of blood and we saw this being mopped up.’

Mr and Mrs Galea, who met when they were 13, were married for 28 years. They also had a son, Narico, 25.

Dr Adeley was highly critical of the way the medical team bypassed the normal ‘gold standard’ procedure to carry out a CT scan to locate clots.

Instead Dr Dare Seriki, a radiologist, moved directly to a mechanical thrombectomy, which was known to carry risks.

Dr Adeley said Mr Galea’s death would have been avoided if the procedure had been halted  20 minutes earlier.

Recording a narrative verdict, Dr Adeley said Mr Galea had died from respiratory failure caused by the tear in the pulmonary artery.

He will now write to the hospital urging the trust to review how it treats emergency blood clots.

The family of the 'much-loved husband, father and friend' are now set to take legal action against the hospital after a coroner ruled the death could have been avoided

Diane Rostron of Linder Myers solicitors said the verdict found Dr Seriki had both a mistaken and outdated approach to the CT scan which should have been carried out.

‘On Dr Seriki's failure to abandon the procedure, had he done so the tear in the artery wall would have been avoided and Brian would be here today.

She said: ‘Also Brian was not adequately consulted before the thrombectomy was carried out and therefore was not able to consider the risks involved in advance.

‘The coroner concluded it was the rupture of the pulmonary artery that quite clearly caused the death and cessation of the procedure would have avoided the tear in the right wall of the pulmonary artery and Brian's death.’
