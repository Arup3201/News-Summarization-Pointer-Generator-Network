Keeping track of polar bear populations in icy and treacherous conditions could be easier from space, according to research.

Scientists have used satellite pictures to monitor the creatures off the coast of Canada, and claim the technology could be used to keep tabs on how the rapidly melting Arctic ice is affecting their numbers.

The images are said to be so detailed, each shot uses around 2.5GB of computer space - 1,300 times more than the average iPhone photo.

High-tech satellites orbiting 480 
miles above Earth are being used for an unusual task - to keep tabs on 
the movement of whales.

Conservationists
 from the British Antarctic Survey (BAS) have developed a way of using 
the space technology to count how many of the mammals are currently 
living in our seas.

The 
satellites, including the WorldView2, take photos of the sea, which are 
then studied using state-of-the-art software to identify whales below 
the surface. 

The researchers began by looking at images taken during late summer in 2012, and counted the number of bears on the island.

The creatures could be distinguished from other light-coloured spots by comparing the satellite pictures with different images of the same island.

An earlier survey suggested there were around 100 bears, and the satellite estimate confirmed this.

Wildlife experts now believe that using satellite pictures could be useful in keeping track of the Arctic polar bear populations, as the speed at which Arctic ice is melting has increased.

Development of efficient techniques for monitoring wildlife is a priority in the Arctic, where the impacts of climate change are acute and remoteness and logistical constraints hinder access.

During analysis, clouds were found to be one of the factors that could make detecting the bears more difficult. The locations of the polar bears are circled on each image

Dr Seth Stapleton, from the U.S. Geological Survey Alaska Science Centre in Anchorage said: ‘The loss of Arctic sea ice has accelerated during recent years, with minimum sea ice extent reaching a record low during September, 2012.

‘A nearly ice-free summer is now forecasted to occur as early as 2016.

'Such large-scale, precipitous environmental changes will be detrimental for many species dependent on sea ice habitats.

‘Despite potentially massive ecological impacts, regimes for monitoring wildlife remain deficient across large portions of the Arctic.

These images were taken during late summer in 2012. Polar bears are present in the circles in the target image (top) but absent in the reference image (bottom). Features that remain consistent between images, including rocks and substrate, are shown with red arrows

‘We evaluated high resolution satellite imagery as a tool to track the distribution and abundance of polar bears.

‘Our findings suggest that satellite imagery is a promising tool for monitoring polar bears on land, with implications for use with other Arctic wildlife.’

The findings were published in the journal PLOS ONE.
