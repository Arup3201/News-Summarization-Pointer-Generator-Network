A death row prisoner was executed by lethal injection today for sexually assaulting and beating his former boss's wife to death with an axe handle in 1995.

Larry Matthew Puckett, 35, was 
pronounced dead at 6.18 pm at the
Mississippi State Penitentiary, authorities said.

Puckett was an 18-year-old Eagle Scout when he was convicted of the murder of Rhonda Hatten Griffis, a 28-year-old mother of two, who was found dead in her mobile home on October 14, 1995.

Puckett had previously worked as a landscaper for the woman's husband David Griffis in Hattiesburg, Mississippi but was due to ship out for basic training with the Navy.

The young woman's mother Nancy Hatten said she had discovered the teenage Puckett in the home with her daughter's dead body holding a club.

She said Puckett tried to blame the 
woman's husband, who arrived shortly afterwards and scuffled with the man. 
Puckett fled and was arrested two days later.

Puckett's supporters protested up until the hour of his execution claiming that Mrs Griffis' husband had killed her in a jealous rage. Puckett had also claimed that he had been having an affair with the woman and her husband caught them.

How the victim's mother said she found Puckett in the home holding an axe handle, which prosecutors believed was used in the killing.

Protest to the end: Mary Puckett led protesters last week as they made a last appeal to stop her son's execution in Mississippi

Nancy Hatten told The Associated Press last week: 'I
caught him in her house with the club in his hand. Her husband wasn't 
anywhere on the premises at the time. He drove up later.'

After fleeing the home, the 18-year-old was captured and although he confessed to being at the home to rob it, he always denied killing the mother of two.

Puckett has been sentenced to death on August 5, 1996.

Puckett's mother Mary led supporters to rally against her son's death sentence at the state Capitol in Jackson and appealed to Governor Phil Bryant to reduce the sentence to life without parole.

Governor Bryant issued a statement last week which read: 'In
light of Mr. Puckett's having been convicted by a jury of his peers 
more than 15 years ago and after a review of the facts associated with 
his case, I have decided not to grant clemency and will not delay the 
execution.

'My thoughts and prayers are with the victim's family.'

In his last hours, Puckett spent time with family and a spiritual adviser.

According to gulflive.com, he ate a last
meal of Macadamia nut pancakes, shrimp and grits, ice cream cake, 
caramel candy and root beer.

Puckett had asked that his relatives 
and lawyer not be present for his execution but Mrs Griffis' parents 
were on the witness list.

Some
4,000 people had signed an online petition set up by Puckett's mother 
to try to persuade Governor Bryant to stop the execution.
