An aristocrat is fighting her neighbour's plans to build a vast cinema and games room underneath their £3.6m home in an exclusive street in north London.

Pamela, Countess Listowel, 77, says rows over people digging 'mega-basements' beneath their homes are dividing the usually friendly community in a conservation area in Hampstead, where dozens have signed a petition against the application.

She is one of 58 people to have objected to Camden council over the application by Iyabode Abiola to undertake extensive excavations beneath her Victorian house.

Lady Listowel, the widow of the 5th Earl of Listowel, William Francis Hare, said: 'It is sad that there is a row over the application as everyone usually gets on around here.

'These sorts of basements are being built all over Hampstead, but it's a conservation area and it's not in keeping with the street.'

Mrs Abiola bought the house, which is close to Hampstead Heath, three years ago.  Neighbours said the owners, whom they believed to be Nigerian, owned several properties in the UK and were not often at the house.

An initial application featured plans to build a swimming pool under the house but was rejected by Camden Council in 2011.  The new plans incorporate a basement that would extend under the house and into the garden.

Neighbour Oliver Froment, 63, said he was concerned his house might collapse if Mrs Abiola's basement were built, and said it had happened in several similar cases in Hampstead.

He told the Daily Telegraph: 'People are just trying to show off by building bigger and deeper, with no consideration for the character of the area or the people who live there.'

Mr Froment, who works in financial services, has hired an independent expert who said he was concerned about the impact of the proposed works.

Camden Council's Valerie Leach said: 'It is essential that the views of residents are taken into account and at present we have received a number of objections and reports that are being reviewed to ensure that planning officers can make a recommendation on the application.'

Rows over vast basements are becoming increasingly common in London, where space is at a premium.

Last month it emerged that a Labour peer was suing his neighbour for 'trespass' over his newly-dug basement, claiming that it went underneath his own property.

Lord Mitchell claimed his Hampstead neighbour Daphne Gillian Singer had undertaken 'hidden' works by digging up a courtyard next to both of their homes.  He and his wife have lodged a writ at the High Court and are seeking up to £200,000 in damages after Ms Singer allegedly built walls beneath his property without consent.

Russian tycoon Leonard Blavatnik boasts London's only indoor/outdoor swimming pool under his Kensington home

Earlier this year a Russian businessman renovated his mansion in London's Kensington to include a pool in the basement which is believed to be the capital's only indoor/outdoor swimming pool.

Leonard Blavatnik, who is Britain's second-richest man, built the 25m pool underneath his home in Kensington Palace Gardens, which is London's most expensive street.  His basement also boasts a hot tub, gym, massage room, cinema, wine-cellar, and 'multi-storey' underground car park.

Estate agents said Mr Blavatnik's property, which is yards from Kensington Palace, could be worth £200m after the tycoon undertook a massive renovation on the 13-bedroom, Grade II*-listed house.
