Women are 'hardest hit by dementia': Actress Prunella Scales (pictured) was last year revealed to have been diagnosed with 'mild Alzheimer’s'

Women are hardest hit by dementia, say experts.

They can spend years caring for loved ones with the illness only to fall victim to it themselves.

A report by the charity Alzheimer’s Research UK warns that dementia is leaving women ‘marginalised’ both as carers and later as patients.

It states that women are two and a half times more likely to look after someone with dementia, most often their husbands.

And they are also more at risk of developing the condition themselves, with around 500,000 women having it compared to 350,000 men.

Hilary Evans, director of external affairs at the research charity, said women suffer a ‘triple whammy’ – as carers, living with the effects of dementia and then dying from it.

She added: ‘Women are carrying the responsibility of care for their loved ones, only later to be living with the condition.

‘Women are dying from dementia but not before it has taken a considerable toll on minds and bodies. In the UK, dementia hits women the hardest.’

‘Dementia is a life-shattering condition and represents a triple whammy for women. More women are dying of dementia, more women are having to bear the burden of care.

‘The experiences of these women underlines the urgent need to tackle the diseases that cause this life-shattering condition. 

'In recent decades we’ve seen increased investment in areas like cancer have a real impact, and we need to emulate that success for dementia.

‘Only through research can we find ways to treat and prevent dementia, and transform the lives of the hundreds of thousands affected.’

An estimated 830,000 people in Britain have dementia, a syndrome characterised by a gradual loss of brain functions such as memory and mental agility.

The numbers with dementia are predicted to rise to 2 million by 2051. The illness is becoming increasingly common as more of us live to an age when it is more prevalent.

It is partly thanks to medical advances in the treatment for heart disease and cancer, which had previously claimed more lives earlier on.

Women’s life expectancies also are longer than men, meaning they are more likely to get the illness.

Dementia is now the leading cause of death in women having overtaken heart disease and stroke. But in men it is third, after heart disease and lung cancer.

The report, which will be published next month, warns that women over 60 are twice as likely to get dementia as breast cancer. It will call for far more funding to be put into research to develop effective treatments.

Plan: Prime Minister David Cameron (pictured in Derby last Thursday) pledged to make dementia a 'national priority' in 2013 and increase the amount of government funding for research

Despite the increasing prevalence of the illness and its toll on society, there is no cure and there are only a limited number of drugs – which can only temporarily halt its progression.

Prime Minister David Cameron pledged to make dementia a ‘national priority’ in 2013 and increase the amount of government funding for research.

But charities say it is still too little when compared to the investment into new treatment for cancer.

In 2013, £503million from charities and the Government went to research for cancer compared to £73.8million for dementia.

The report will conclude that the toll of dementia on society in Britain will get worse unless it is properly addressed by the Government.

‘The UK already has a larger proportion of people over 65 than the EU average, and as the number of older people rises steeply, the need for carers will continue to increase,’ it will conclude.
