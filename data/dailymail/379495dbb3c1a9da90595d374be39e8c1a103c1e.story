When night falls in Damascus, these days most people lock themselves fearfully in their homes.Â 

But a few still venture out, on a mission to drown out the thunder of artillery fire with the boom of dance music.

Though shells are raining down on suspected rebel positions in suburbs just a few miles away, these determined revellers head to the Syrian capital's night clubs to try to forget the war on their doorstep.

'Change of atmosphere': Young people dance at a nightclub in downtown Damascus, a city which, like the rest of Syria, has been riven by a 30-month old civil war that is thought to have left 100,000 dead

Raving, I'm raving: Young men dressed in Western-style clothes lift their hands in the air as a track thunders through the club's PA, drowning out the sound of artillery fire hurtling towards rebel-held suburbs

'I come here for a change of atmosphere,' says Mohammad, a 25-year-old car salesman, who has clearly had a drink or three.

'There is joy here,' he says of the nightclub in the upscale Shaalan neighbourhood, where the barman juggles bottles of spirits.

'I want to live, I don't want to hear any more bad news.'

On the dance floor, customers shake to a track popular among supporters of President Bashar al-Assad's regime.

'Don't ask me how or why, it's the army that protects us,' the lyric goes.

'You
 and I salute General Maher,' a reference to President Bashar al-Assad's
 brother, who heads the elite army Fourth Division but is in fact a 
colonel.

A place to forget: The night club does brisk business despite the civil war raging around it, with its manager saying that it stays open until 2am. But he asked that its name was not revealed for fear of reprisals

Among the performers is Mudi al-Arabi, a 22-year-old rapper, who returned to Damascus just two months ago after spending the previous two years living in Morocco.

He is determined to keep up a happy-go-lucky lifestyle despite the constant threat of death.

'Everyone's going to die some day, but the Syrian people love life and the most important thing is to be happy,' he said.

'If the United States attacks us, I'm sure our army will defend us,' he added.

'Guys come here with their friends or with their girlfriends, to forget the week's routine.'

Arabi's songs are heavy with nostalgia for the Damascus of before the war when there were regular music festivals

Now he performs just once a fortnight at private parties. Since the uprising against Assad's rule erupted in March 2011, the authorities have been wary of public gatherings and it has become difficult to get the necessary authorisations.

'It's hard to get permission from the security services,' Arabi said.

The nightclub does brisk business despite - or perhaps because of - the war raging outside.

'We stay open until 2:00 am. It's going well,' said 29-year-old manager Bashar.

'But please don't mention the club's name. I'm afraid someone might do us harm because they think we shouldn't be having fun while people are dying.'

The club is one of a dozen still open in Damascus 30 months into a conflict that has killed more than 100,000 people and reduced some of the capital's suburbs to rubble.

Damascus's clubbing scene is just one 
part of life that is continuing almost as normal in the face of the 
desperate conflict which has riven the country.

By
 and large, the shops, cafes and businesses of the Syrian capital remain
 open for business as usual, even as the country's beleaguered regime 
fights for survival.

Seeing the city's youth enjoying nights out on the town, it is difficult to imagine such atrocities as last month's poison gas attack in Ghouta happen just a few minutes drive away.

And it is just as hard to imagine the destructive effect a barrage of the West's cruise missiles could have in the event that the U.S. and its allies' threats are finally carried out.

'Here, I'm different, I feel happy. We've all become friends,' said the young economics graduate.

The club's owner, Arwa, is the proud mother of Mohammad Bash, who reached the semi-finals in the regional Star Academy singing competition.

'He loves coming here to sing along with his friends,' said Arwa.
