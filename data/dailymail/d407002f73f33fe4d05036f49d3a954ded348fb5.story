The actor son of the legendary star Dennis Hopper is accused of raping a 15-year-old girl after luring her to his home with promises of a 'casting couch' photo shoot.

The unidentified girl is suing Henry Hopper for damages 'in the millions of dollars' for allegedly assaulting her several times after plying her with drugs and alcohol in April 2011.

The teen's new lawyer, Jeff Herman, claimed to MailOnline on Monday that Hopper traded on his father's fame to convince her to go to his house after the pair met on Facebook via mutual friends.

Mr Herman is taking over the lawsuit after it was initially filed last year and has not yet gone to trial.

'He said, "Let's take photos of you" and he used the to entice her to see him,' Mr Herman alleged to MailOnline.

Mr Herman claimed the then-20-year-old Hopper promised to snap modeling pictures of her and to use his fame to help her.

The girl, now 17 years old, met Hopper on Facebook via mutual friends in 2011.

Mr Herman said it's a classic 
'casting couch' scam that is used all over Hollywood to lure 
unsuspecting girls and young women into sex.

Henry Hopper's agent refused to comment about any of the allegations facing the actor when asked by MailOnline.

After meeting online, the lawsuit 
alleges, the two began messaging back and forth in spite of the fact 
that he was five years older than she was.

Mr Herman says that after communicating electronically, 
they eventually agreed to meet at Hopper's house. He paid for a cab to 
pick the girl up and drive her to his home in April 2011.

When she arrived, he gave her unspecified 'non-narcotic' drugs and alcohol, and that is when the sexual assault occurred.

'Over
 about the next 10 months, there were more incidents in which Hopper 
again had Jane Doe brought to his house, furnished her with drugs and 
alcohol, and then raped her,' the lawyer said in a press release.

'These
 encounters were initiated through sexual Facebook messages from Hopper 
to Jane Doe. These sexual messages included, among other things, a 
request that Jane Doe send him photos of her so she can “pleasure him 
from afar”; and being into a “school girl vibe” when “doin the nasty” 
with Jane Doe.'

Mr Herman said his client reported 
the allegation to police, but that the investigation remains open and 
Hopper was never charged with a crime.

The teen says her life 'fell apart' 
after the attack. She lost her friends and had to be hospitalized 
several times for mental health issues.

Despite this, Mr Herman says, she went back to Hopper's house several times and maintained a sexual relationship with him.

'He continues to contact her and for a while, she had nothing - this was the only thing she had,' he said.

Mr Herman said she was a 'compliant 
victim' at that point - but maintains Hopper was taking advantage of her
 fragile mental state.

The teen's mental and emotional problems continue to this day, he added.

Henry Hopper is an actor who appeared in 'Tree of Life' and Gus Van Sant's 'Restless,' both in 2011.

His father Dennis died at the age of 74 in 2010, following a battle with prostate cancer.

He was known for cult classics such as Easy Rider, Apocalypse Now and Blue Velvet.

Henry's mother, Katherine LaNasa, was the fourth wife of Dennis Hopper.
