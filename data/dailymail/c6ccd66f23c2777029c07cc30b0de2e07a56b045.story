A comedy about sex workers shot entirely on an iPhone 5s has premiered at the Sundance Film Festival and is now set for worldwide distribution. 

Tangerine, written and directed by Sean Baker, follows a transgender prostitute on Christmas Eve after her release from prison.

Discovering her lover - a pimp - has been cheating on her, she goes on a rampage through the streets of Los Angeles.

The entire project was filmed on the handheld device in a city suburb with some scenes being recorded on the back of Baker's ten-speed pedal bike.

They were also forced to work in open stores, meaning they would have to cut when a customer walked in.

But they admitted one advantage was hardly anyone knew they were filming as the device was so small. 

Many amateur films are produced on iPhones every day, but this is said to be the first shown at a high profile event. 

Baker told The Verge: 'It was surprisingly easy. We never lost any footage.'

The small crew - working on a shoestring budget - used a number of add-ons to enhance the quality of the picture. 

Future: The film was given a warm reception at Sundance and has now been picked up by Magnolia Pictures for worldwide distribution

An anamorphic adapter lens was attached to the camera for a 'cinematic' look while a stabilizer helped combat the iPhone's tendency to shake.

An $8 app called Filmic Pro also allowed the filmmakers fine-grained control over the focus, aperture, and color temperature to enhance the picture quality. 

The film follows in the wake of TV shows Transparent and Orange is the New Black, both of which feature trans characters.

It received a warm reception after it was aired at Sundance and has now been picked up by Magnolia Pictures for world distribution.
