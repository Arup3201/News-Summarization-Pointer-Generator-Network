Miss Universe Thailand has resigned after being attacked on social media for being 'too fat' and for her political views.

Weluree Ditsayabut, 22, won the crown last month, but came under fire for Facebook messages posted before the competition in which she said red shirt protesters 'should all be executed.'

Disayabut tearfully announced she was 
giving up the title that would have allowed her to compete in the 
international Miss Universe pageant at a press conference this afternoon.

Weluree Ditsayabut, Thai Miss Universe 2014, has resigned today after being attacked on social media for being too fat and for her political views

The red shirts are a political pressure group who support the deposed former Thai prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra against pro-royalist protesters who have seized control of the country's capital.

The
 actress and former talk show host said a hail of brutal comments on 
social media had given her and her mother sleepless nights.

According to the Bangkok Post, she said: 'I've made this decision on my own. I would like to thank all the judges who selected me as well as my parents, friends and those who looked after me.

'I also want to thank the people who made comments about me, both good and bad ones, through the media.

'At
 first, my family was happy for me when I was crowned. But there's no 
more happiness following waves of criticism from the society.'

Organisers of Thailand's Miss Universe competition have said future applicants will have their social media accounts vetted beforehand

Weluree was an surprise choice for the Miss Universe Thailand crown, beating crowd favourite Pimbongkod 'Ellie' Chankaew into second place.

As Weluree was crowned, shouts of 'Ellie, Ellie' and 'Keep on fighting Ellie', could be heard from the crowd amid boos and jeers.

However, it was not immediately clear who would replace Weluree as images of Pimbongkod kissing a man have also appeared online, causing controversy.

Organisers of Miss Universe Thailand told reporters that they will have to review other criteria, such as social media, when screening and selecting contestants in the future.

Weluree's comments struck at the heart of Thailand's long-running political crisis, expressing the attitude of the country's educated elite and royalists toward the government of then-Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra.

Yingluck, who was backed by many in Thailand's rural north and northeast, was forced to step down last month, and the military soon afterward staged a coup against the elected civilian government.

Thai society has been sharply polarized since 2006, when Yingluck's brother, then-Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, was ousted in a coup and subsequently fled into exile to avoid a corruption conviction.

Since then until the recent coup, Thaksin's opponents and the Red Shirts staged competing protests in an ongoing battle for political power.Video Source YouTube
