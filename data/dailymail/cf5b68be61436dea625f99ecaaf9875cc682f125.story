A new poll of New Hampshire voters shows Mitt Romney with a commanding lead over his potential Republican presidential challengers.

Romney was far and away Republican voters and right leaning independents' first choice in the all-important primary state in NH1's latest survey.

Nearly a third of respondents said they'd support Romney, the former governor of neighboring state Massachusetts, if their state's primary, slated for February of 2016, were held now.

Still the one: A majority of Republican voters and right-leaning independents in New Hampshire would pick Mitt Romney all over again if he ran for president in 2016, as he's suggested he might

Romney indicated earlier this month that he may seek the Republican nomination again next year after repeatedly telling reporters throughout the fall that another presidential campaign was off the table. 

His about-face has turned the race upside down and could present a problem for former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, who shares the same base of donors and campaign hands as establishment-backed Romney.

The two men met yesterday in Utah, where Romney has a home, for a previously planned meeting. It's unclear from aides' description of the get together what, if any, agreement the former governors came to about the 2016 race.

'Governor Bush enjoyed visiting with Governor Romney today in Salt Lake,' Bush's spokeswoman Kristy Campbell told the New York Times, but wouldn't say more. 

'Every interaction I’ve observed between them has been positive and friendly,' former Utah Gov. Mike Leavitt, a Romney ally, told the Times. I'm 'very confident it was a gentlemanly conversation.' 

If the both Romney and Bush proceed with presidential campaigns, their relationship will likely become a whole lot less 'gentlemanly.' To clinch the nomination, the like-minded politicians must be able to differentiate themselves for voters.

So far Romney, with his high name ID left over from the last presidential contest, is winning the battle. 

Bush garnered less than half the support of Romney in the New Hampshire poll, taking just 11 percent of the vote.

New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker were tied at eight percent, coming in just ahead of retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson and Rand Paul, whom each attracted seven percent of likely primary voters.

Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee was the favorite of just five percent of respondents and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida were voters' last choices at four and three percent, respectively.
