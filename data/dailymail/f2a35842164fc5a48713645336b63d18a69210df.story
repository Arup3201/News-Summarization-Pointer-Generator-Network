When a cargo ship carrying 66 women convicts to Australia was seized in the 18th century, it became one of the most infamous mutinies of all time.

Now a diary written by the carpenter has shed new light on the incident which happened on the Lady Shore off the coast of South America.

Today the work, produced by Thomas Millard, from Deptford, south London, sold for £12,500 at auction.

Convict ship: The Lady Shore, like this ship, was heading for Australia when the mutiny happened in 1797 off the coast of South America

The ship was heading from Gravesend, Kent, to Bontany Bay in 1797 when it was seized by the French soldiers employed to guard the convicts.

The women on board had been sentenced to an average of seven years' transportation for committing minor offences such as theft.

Captain James Willcocks was murdered and 28 people were cut adrift off the coast of Brazil in an echo of the Mutiny of Bounty.

All of the survivors ended up in Spanish South America and they were imprisoned and held in appalling conditions.

The 30-month journal reveals details of the mutiny, the suffering on board and their relationships with the men.

Millard writes how he was woken up by the sound of the captain being shot dead as the mutiny happened on August 1, 1797.

'We ware Alarm'd by the firing of Musketts on the deck and to my Great Surpris the Capt falling down the steeridge ladder which woke me out of my Sleep,' he writes.

Another officer was shouting: 'Give them the ship, Give them the ship.'

Millard records: 'I was afraid ever minute that some or the others would Blow my brains out with Pistol or run the Bayonets into me.'

He tells how the ship's purser, John Black, tried to kill himself because he did not want to be murdered by the French mutineers.

'[He] jumped out of the Cuddey [cabin] window that he should say these words that the Frenchmen should not have the pleasure of taking his life and was drowned.'

But, he added, 'to our great surprise' Black later 'entered the Cabbin with with Blue Cross bar silk Handkerchief tied about his head he looked if he had been crying very much.'

Millard, as the carpenter, was kept on the ship against his will.

Under the hammer: Carpenter Thomas Millard's journal, which was 320 pages long, chronicling the mutiny and the 18 months that followed

His skills were used to prepare the longboat in which the 28 men, women and children used to make it through violent storms to Brazil.

The mutineers had wanted to reach South America as Spain was an ally of France at the time.

But when the Lady Shore arrived on the River Plate on August 28, everyone was imprisoned.

He recalls how at Christmas the prisoners made punch and drank the health of the king despite the gloom.

The Spanish authorities had been uncertain how to treat the new arrivals.

Many of the 66 women convicts were taken on as unpaid servants in Buenos Aires.

Millard was allowed out to work for a shipwright during the day but returned to prison at night.

He was more fortunate than most; in the summer of 1799 he was allowed to sail in the Liberty to America, where he settled in New Jersey, took a wife and raised two children. 

The 320-page journal was auctioned after being put up for sale by Millard's American descendants.

Sotheby's specialist Dr Gabriel Heaton said: 'It is a fascinating story of early colonial history, presenting a totally new view of events by a man kept on board against his will and forced to work for the mutineers.

'He gives a fresh account of the fight for the ship, the death of Captain Willcocks and the abandonment of the crew in the longboat but also provides an exceptionally important record of events after landing in South America.

'He makes frequent references to the desperately unlucky convict women, the conditions of their confinement, the relationships that developed between the men and the women of the Lady Shore, the births and deaths of children and other details that provide glimpses into the extraordinary lives of an unfortunate group of women who found themselves prisoners of war thousands of miles from home.'
