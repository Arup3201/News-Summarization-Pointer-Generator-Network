A credit card belonging to a Wall Street Journal reporter, who has been missing from his New Jersey home since Saturday, has allegedly been used in Mexico.

David Bird was last seen at his Long Hill Township home on Saturday afternoon, when he told his wife he was going for a walk.

Police searched the woods and river near his home, but there had been no sign of the 55-year-old until his credit card was reportedly used on Wednesday night.

Missing: David Bird was last seen on Saturday when he told his wife he planned to take a walk

According to NBC News, the card was used for a purchase in Mexico, and the family believe Mr Bird's disappearance may be connected to his coverage of Opec.

Mr Bird, a father-of-two, covered energy markets for the Wall Street Journal, and works for the Dow Jones.

He was recovering from a gastrointestinal virus when he disappeared, leaving behind his cell phone and vital medication he has to take twice a day for a liver transplant.

Carolyn Buscarino, who has known the family for ten years, dismissed the NBC report as 'speculation' and told the New York Post: 'There are a lot of rumors going around.'

Opec - the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries - is a group of 12 oil-exporting countries based in Africa, the Middle East, South America and Latin America.

Mr Bird's reports on the organization tended to be straightforward news pieces, leading others to also dismiss the connection between his disappearance and the group as nothing more than rumors.

A call to the Morris County Prosecutor's Officer to confirm reports of the card being used has not yet been returned.

Police Chief Michael Mazzeo told the Echoes-Sentinel on Thursday morning that the 'only thing to report is that he is still missing'.

Search: About 200 police and volunteers have been combing woodland and a river near David Bird's home

Mr Bird's wife, Nancy, reported her 
husband missing a couple of hours after he left their home at 4.30pm, 
saying he wanted to take a walk before heavy rain was expected.

'I
 knew this wasn't right. Something was wrong. He's a really great dad 
and a really great husband,' she told the Wall Street Journal.

An extensive search involving about 200 police and volunteers has been carried out since Saturday. Helicopters and divers have been used to search the surrounding area and walking routes favored by Mr Bird.

Despite needing medication twice a day for the liver transplant he had about nine years ago, Mr Bird regularly hiked and also ran the New York Marathon last year.

When he left the house, the 6ft 1in reporter was wearing a red jacket with a yellow zipper, and a hat with a flashlight strapped to it.
