Everton are closing on a deal to take Romelu Lukaku back to Goodison Park.

Roberto Martinez has made signing the Belgian his top priority of the summer and is looking increasing like landing his man possibly in the next 48 hours.

Martinez, who had considered Demba Ba as an alternative but could not agree his Â£80,000 a week personal terms, will have pulled off a major coup if he persuades the 21-year-old Belgian to sign.
