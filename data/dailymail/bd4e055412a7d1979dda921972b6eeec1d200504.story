Finding yourself stuck in traffic and needing a toilet break can be an unpleasant experience.

But what if you could spend a penny while on the move?

A plumber has built the world's fastest fully-functioning toilet which has a powerful 140cc motorbike engine hidden under the seat and four gears.

Potty: Chris Furze sits on his toilet which can travel at speeds of up to 55mph 

Colin Furze, 33, spent a month building the breakneck bog which is even filled with water so it can be flushed using a button on the handle bars. 

There is also a clip so he can read the newspaper while he zooms along.

The petrol-powered lavatory can almost reach the national speed limit and does 10 miles to the gallon.

'It is quite scary to drive as the water in the toilet makes it very top heavy and I get wet when I go over any bumps,' said Mr Furze, from Stamford, Lincolnshire.

'The toilet seat is also quite slippery so it's hard to stay on and stop myself from sliding off when I go fast. It's also pretty tricky to steer.'

Mr Furze, who is often called out to fix and install toilets, decided to build the super loo as a bit of fun.He used a mobility scooter for the base and attached a steel frame with a wooden plinth before mounting the white toilet on top.

He has fitted four electronic gears to the handlebars and built a manual override, disguised as a toilet brush in case they fail.

Mr Furze has also added a towel rail to the back of the toilet, covered the base with black and white lino tiles and turned the exhaust into a toilet roll holder to make it look authentic.

'I'm a plumber and I'm used to putting toilets together so I thought I'd try the challenge of making the fastest,' said Mr Furze.

'I've seen people build them before using mopeds, but I've given mine a more powerful engine so it can go much faster.'

Mr Furze has managed to get the toilet to travel at an amazing 55mph but believes it will be able to go even faster along a smooth track and may even reach 60mph.

The previous fastest toilet was the Bog Standard, which could travel at 42.25mph and was presented on the set of Lo Show Dei Record in Milan, Italy in March 2011.

A Canadian stunt woman Jolene Van Vugt recorded a speed of 46mph on a motorised toilet in Sydney last year, but this was not verified by Guinness.

Mr Furze will be doing an official time trial at the Shakespeare County Raceway in Stratford upon Avon on Saturday and hopes to gain a place in the Guinness Book of Records.
