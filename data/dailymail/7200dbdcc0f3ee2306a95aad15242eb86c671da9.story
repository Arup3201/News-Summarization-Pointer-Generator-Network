One person has died and around 20 others have been injured after a teenage suicide bomber attacked a play condemning such violence at a French-run school in Afghanistan.

According to witnesses the boy walked into the amphitheater of the French Cultural Centre, inside the grounds of Estiqlal High School in the capital Kabul, before detonating the device.

The audience had been watching a drama condemning suicide attacks.

At least one person has been killed and another 20 wounded after a teenage suicide bomber detonated inside a French school in the Afghan capital of Kabul

A government minister has said the bomber was around 16 years old and is reported to have walked into the school's amphitheatre during a music performance before setting off his device

General Ayoub Salangi, acting head of the Interior Ministry, said the suspected theatre bomber appeared to have been about 17 years old and detonated his explosives  during an early evening performance.

The incident came just hours after a suicide bomber targeted a bus carrying Afghan army personnel, killing six soldiers and wounding 11.

'I heard a deafening explosion...There were Afghans, foreigners, young girls and young boys watching the show,' Sher Ahmad, an Afghan rights activist who was at the performance, told Reuters.

He said the blast came during a performance of a new play called 'Heartbeat: Silence After the Explosion', a condemnation of suicide attacks.

He said: 'Pieces of flesh were plastered on the wall. There were children and women crying for help. 

'Some were running out, some were just screaming.'

General Abdul Rahman Rahimi, Kabul's police chief said: 'There was one person killed and between 15 to 20 wounded. 

'Because of the smoke, it was impossible to identify the exact number of the casualties.'

The explosion is believed to have happened towards the back of the room, near a group of journalists and photographers covering the event.

The man who died is believed to have been a German national, but he has not yet been identified.  

The Afghan Journalists' Association said at least two reporters were wounded in the attack. 

Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said the bomber targeted the event because it was staged 'to insult Islamic values and spread propaganda about our jihad operations, especially on suicide attacks'.  

The attack came as U.S. and other foreign troops wind down their combat role in Afghanistan, leading to a resurgence in Taliban attacks

Sources say that Taliban attackers have been targeting foreign buildings in order to get more attention

The venue was heavily guarded during the event, said Kabul police chief Abdul Rahman Rahimi, who added that the bomber may have hidden explosives in his underwear to pass through security.

He said the bomber detonated the explosives at the top of the auditorium stairs, which may have prevented more casualties. 

He added that although the body of the bomber was badly damaged, police were able to identify him as a teenager because his head was found 'intact'. 

The school, which is run under contract by the French government, is close to the Presidential Palace and was established in 1922. 

It taught exclusively in French until 1985, but is now administered by Afghanistan's Education Ministry which enforces a broader curriculum.

French Embassy official Yves Manville said the French government funds the school and provides some of the teachers. 'Our main activities at the school are cultural,' he said.

No French citizens were among the casualties, he added.

The Taliban are stepping up their attacks across Afghanistan as foreign troops withdraw and Afghan forces fail to make up the numbers

U.S. troop numbers were supposed to drop to 9,800 by the end of the month but the drawdown has now been halted amid concerns that not enough fighters will remain

Earlier today the head of NATO's international security assistance force warned that Afghan forces are still 'inept' at basic tasks and are struggling to recruit amid killings and desertions

The bombing was the latest in a string of insurgent attacks on foreign targets in Kabul, amid a stepped-up Taliban insurgency as U.S. troops step down their role in the country.

There are still around 10,500 U.S. soldiers in Afghanistan, a number that was supposed to drop to 9,800 by the end of the month, though that has now been postponed due to a shortage.

Earlier today Lieutenant-General Joseph Anderson, head of the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) in Afghanistan, also warned that Afghan troops are 'inept' as NATO forces prepare to leave at the end of the year. 

He also warned that there is a shortage of personnel as recruitment fails to keep pace with injuries, deaths and desertions.

Sources said the suicide bombers are deliberately targeting foreign targets in order to get more coverage. The school run under contract by the French authorities

It is unusual for the Taliban to use female suicide bombers, especially one as young as 16-years-old

He added: 'You've got a mix of uniform police, civil obedience police and the army, all in the same footprint, debating over who has got primacy for responsibility. That's a fundamental issue here.'

In the past month attacks have killed a British embassy security guard and a South African charity worker and his two teenage children.

Analysts say the Taliban are choosing foreign targets to ensure maximum publicity.

Hashmat Stanikzai, spokesman for the Kabul provincial police chief, said the attacker was on foot and that civilians were among the wounded. 

The school attack came hours after the Taliban claimed responsibility for an attack on a minibus that killed six soldiers and injured ten others, including civilians
