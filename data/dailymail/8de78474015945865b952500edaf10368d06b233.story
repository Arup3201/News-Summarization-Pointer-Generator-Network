Daniel Kirkwood was killed in a nightclub brawl in the early hours of this morning

An 18-year-old who was killed in a nightclub brawl in the early hours of this morning has been named as Daniel Kirkwood. 

Police launched a murder inquiry after the teenager was found fatally injured outside the Society nightclub in Tower Street, Coventry. 

Today, revellers at the scene were slammed for taking pictures as Mr Kirkwood lay dying and posting them on photo-sharing app Snapchat. 

Curtis Goodwin wrote on Twitter: 'Disgusting, someone was stabbed outside club in Coventry gasping for breath and all people cared about was snap-chatting'. 

Police and ambulance crews were called to the club in response to reports of a disturbance inside the venue at 2am. 

Mr Kirkwood was taken to hospital where he died soon after arrival. His family and friends took to social media to post tributes. 

His cousin Canice O'Neill posted a picture of Mr Kirkwood on Facebook and said: 'RIP to one of my favourite cousins, Daniel Kirkwood love you so much, missing you already, you are one of the most nicest people I have met, always caring for others, can't believe it.'

She also blasted revellers who took pictures of Daniel as he lay dying. She wrote: 'This makes me sick. People have no respect.'

Luke Strong, another of his cousins, tweeted: 'How someone can do something like that is beyond me. You will be missed by a lot of people, RIP to my cousin Daniel Kirkwood.'

Alisha Docherty added: 'So disgusting what everything's coming to! Rest in peace Daniel Kirkwood.' 

Melissa Mulvey said: 'Really can't believe what has happened last night in town and what the world is coming to, R.I.P Daniel Kirkwood, you will be missed.' 

A witness, who says the nightclub regularly attracts trouble, said she saw the teenager collapse to the ground after being stabbed. 

Marie Smith, 52, was cleaning up after a party at the Royal Warwicks working men's club she manages over the road, when bar staff said there was a brawl outside.

'There was about ten of them and this lad suddenly just dropped to the ground,' she said.

'There was another lad on the floor with him and it looked like they were fighting, but it quickly became apparent it was something serious and he was trying to help him.'

After the victim had dropped to the ground, Ms Smith said she then saw a number of men jumped into cars and drive away as the crowd dispersed.

Marie Smith, 52, who witnessed the brawl, said there is often trouble at the popular nightspot

'There were two ambulances, two police vans and lots of police cars there straight away,' she said.

'The police have told us he was stabbed.

'There might have been scuffle inside and it spilled outside but we don't know. The brawl when he was stabbed was definitely outside the club.'

Marie, who lives at the working men's club, said there is often trouble at the popular nightspot.

She added: 'The place keeps changing its name and owners but there is always trouble there and the police are always going in and out.

'A few people were stabbed there two years ago. No-one died but I think someone was left disabled as a result of it.'  

The superclub had been hosting a rave night, promoted as #TekTimeCov, from 11pm until 4am, which featuring performances from several DJs. 

Revellers immediately took to Twitter to express their shock at the man's death, with some reporting a knife was used inside the club.

Others questioned why clubbers were not thoroughly searched for weapons on arrival. 

One said: 'I can't even bear to imagine the pain of a mother losing her son, even so on Mother's Day. An awful memory.'

Another added: 'I cant believe a boy died at a rave. My heart is aching for his mum. Finding out something like that on today of all days.'  

Tower Street is expected to remain closed for most of today while forensics experts scour the scene for evidence. 

The youngster, from Coventry, was found injured at 2am. He was taken to hospital but died soon after arrival

The superclub, which was hosting a rave from 11am until 4am, is located close to student accommodation

A West Midlands Ambulance Service said: 'Ambulance staff arrived to find a man in a critical condition.

'He subsequently suffered a cardiac arrest and ambulance staff began advanced life support which continued on the way to hospital.

'Unfortunately, shortly after the man's arrival at the hospital it became apparent nothing could be done to save him and he was confirmed deceased.'

A second man was treated for chest and back injuries whilst another suffered arm injuries.

Two women were also injured in the incident, one suffering foot injuries and one suffering leg injuries. 

Four men have been arrested on suspicion of murder.

A police spokesman said: 'The four men have been arrested on suspicion of murder and are being held at separate police stations in Birmingham and Warwickshire.'
