Everton will face Dynamo Kiev in the last 16 of the Europa League after the draw was made in Nyon, Switzerland on Friday.

The Toffees beat Swiss side Young Boys 3-1 at Goodison Park on Thursday night, completing a 7-2 aggregate win after an impressive 4-1 victory in Bern last week.

Roberto Martinez's side now face a two-legged tie against the Ukrainian outfit in March, with a trip to Kiev on 19.

Dynamo Kiev made it to the last 16 after seeing off Guingamp 4-3 on aggregate, with a 3-1 victory on Thursday evening proving decisive.

Crowd trouble marred the fixture, with Kiev fans pictured fighting among themselves at the Valeriy Lobanovskyi Dynamo Stadium.

Goalkeeper Olexandr Shovkovskiy took it upon himself to try and calm the crowd although the game had to be halted for 15 minutes.

The two major ties of the round involve Serie A teams, with Celtic's conquerors Inter Milan taking on Andre Schurrle's Wolfsburg. 

That could be seen as the most tantalising fixture, although supporters of Fiorentina and Rome would beg to differ. The pair go head-to-head on March 12 and 19.

Zenit St Petersburg, managed by former Tottenham and Chelsea boss Andre Villas-Boas, are to play Torini.

Besiktas - who beat Liverpool on penalties in the last 32 - will travel to Club Brugge for their first leg.
