There has been a rise in the number of Chinese investors snapping up apartments in New York after finding they can get more for their money in Manhattan than Shanghai or Hong Kong.

Russians used to dominate the property market in the city, but their interest has dropped since the crisis in Ukraine and the increasing threat of sanctions.

The number of buyers from China is nearly a fifth higher than it was this time last year, with many signing deals on properties they haven't even viewed in person.Â

One of the driving forces behind the increased interest in the Manhattan property market is that investors find they get more square footage for their money.

In previously popular markets for Chinese, such as Hong Kong, buyers expect to pay between $4,100 to $5,000 per square foot. But in Manhattan it is nearer $2,100.

'By far and away, the Chinese are the fastest-growing demographic,' Dean Jones, of Sotheby's International, said.

'They are the top consumer for real estate, and New York is front and center.'

Nikki Field, of Sotheby's, added that the Russians had been 'gone since the Crimean outbreak' and said Chinese investors now accounted for 28.5 percent of his international business.

'We've only scratched the surface with Chinese demand,' Field said, adding that in the first quarter of this year Chinese business was up 19 percent from the same time period last year.

No official figures exist for the nationalities of home buyers because of New York's discrimination laws, but five top real estate brokers gave Reuters their listing of foreign investors.

Chinese buyers took the lead in volume and value of sales in all five estimates.

'In sheer 
numbers, the Chinese outspend the Russians in every segment of the 
market,' Pamela Liebman, of Corcoran 
Group, told Reuters.

One key factor was their desire to establish a base in cities such as New York and London so their children have access to Western education.

Apartments near leading universities are popular with families, even when the child is too young to walk, let alone start life at college.

Shawn Elliott, who takes groups of Chinese buyers on property tours every week, said: 'They're
 looking for trophy properties. They're looking for 
their children to be comfortable, and to be near Columbia or New York 
University.'

Typically, Chinese investors spend between $1 million to $5 milion in New York, and buy two to three properties as an investment.

But a recent trend has seen them move towards the luxury range, with a fashion for taking apartments in One57, the 90-storey building overlooking Central Park.

Pritzker Prize-winning architect Christian de Portzamparc designed the skyscraper, where apartments start at $18.85 million for a three-bedroom, and rise to $55 million for a home that covers the entire 81st floor.

Each apartment has floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking Central Park and the Manhattan skyline, and the building has a private performance room, swimming pool and gym and yoga studio, and 24ft aquarium.

Another popular luxury building is the Baccarat Hotels & Residences, where one buyer recently took over two apartments for $13 million without ever stepping foot inside them.

The entire deal was conducted through the Chinese social networking site, WeChat, according to Emma Hao of Douglas Elliman, who managed the sale.

Brokers forecast the Chinese will continue to dominate the market, with Liam Bailey of Knight Frank said: 'There will be more Chinese buyers, and they will take more share of the market.'
