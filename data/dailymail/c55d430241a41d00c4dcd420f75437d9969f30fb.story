The photo editor of the famed National Geographic magazine has raided the publication's vast archive of 11.5 million images and selected her favourites for an online auction.

For more than a 125 years the pages of National Geographic magazine have been filled with stunning images captured by photographers from across the globe - making senior photo editor Elizabeth Krist's task of selecting the best particularly daunting.

Among the 70 eventually selected for the online sale with National Geographic, 'Limitless: Iconic Photographs From National Geographic: Editor's Choice', include an array of stunning shots that capture the magic of daily life - from a young seal playing off the Canadian coast, to hoards of people basking in the warm waters of the Szechenyi Baths in Hungarian capital Budapest.Â 

Playful: Photographer Brian Skerry's shot of a young Harp seal in the waters of the Gulf of St. Lawrence, Canada, is one of 70 images from National Geographic magazine selected as part of a Christie's online auction

Steamy: Photgrapher Ami Vitale took this shot of hoards of bathers enjoying the warmth of the Szechenyi Baths in Budapest, Hungary in 2012. The image is among 70 for sale through the Christie's website

Global appeal: For more than a 125 years the pages of National Geographic magazine have been filled with stunning images, such as this photograph of the hot springs at Hveravellir in Iceland, captured by Erlend Haarberg

Fine art prints of the images are being sold through the Christie's website until tomorrow, with starting prices of $400. Some of the photographs have been attracting bids of more than $1,000, with one image featuring a family of African elephants in currently at $3,500.

Also featured in the varied collection, the third collaboration with Christie's, are images dating back to the 1940s, among them awe-inspiring landscapes, animals and people taken by photographers including Carsten Peter and Jodi Cobb.

'It was a really different experience trying to curate the auction because I'm so used to curating for magazine stories in which you're really looking for a series of images that tell a story,' said Ms Krist.

Celebration: Sarah Leen's The Silver Man, featuring a reveller coated in silver body paint while wearing a mask and cardboard crown, was taken during the carnival celebrations at San Nicolas de los Ranchos, Puebla State, Mexico in 1998

Awe-inspiring: Photographer Carsten Peter journeyed to Mount Erebus on Ross Island, Antarctica to capture this shot of biologists scaling an ice tower in 2012

'I'm always looking for a narrative and how all the different images will fit together but in this case it was such a luxury because you're just looking for pure sensuous beauty.

'Each image can just stand on its own.

'While it's true that while I'm selecting images for a magazine story I'm looking for those dynamic points in the story, whereas for the auction I feel the images can be more contemplative. They do not have to be about something, they can just convey an emotion and that really can be enough.'

Ms Krist selected her favourite images after combing through the National Geographic's huge picture database containing every image featured in the magazine, dating back to 1888.

Old and new: David Bowman tool this picture at St Paul, Minnesota earlier this year, and it joined images dating back to the 1940s in the Christie's collection

Under the sea: A diver kneels beneath the bow of Russian destoyer 356, renamed the MV Keith Tibbetts, that was sunk as an artificial reef off Cayman Brac, Cayman Islands

Timing: Photographers Diane Cook and Len Jenshel managed to capture the exact moment these Fourth of July fireworks exploded over the New York skyline

As well as searching through the archive, which features more than 11.5 million images, she scoured books published by the magazine and previous collections compiled for exhibitions, selecting 250, which the auction house then whittled down to 70 prints.

'I could have kept going forever and the more time I had the more diamonds I could have kept digging up,' she said.

'The scope of the images we have included in the auction is so broad.

'We have portraits, we have landscapes, we have wildlife - but I think there is one quality that runs through all of the photographs and that's a sense of the photographer's innate curiosity.'
