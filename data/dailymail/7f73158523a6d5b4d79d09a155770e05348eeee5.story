A potentially dangerous teenager has been released from jail after being acquitted on charges of attacking a female jogger last month in Bremerton, Washington.

A judge decided Tuesday to free the unidentified 14-year-old suspect due to lack of sufficient evidence, and victim Jordan Monasmith says the local authorities are to blame.

Detention officers washed the suspect's clothing after he was arrested, thus erasing any potential DNA evidence from their run-in.

During the trial, Ms Monasmith's account of the attack was replayed in recordings of her calls to 911.

Jordan Monasmith says she was attacked outside of her Bremerton, Washington apartment last month

However, the unidentified 14-year-old who attacked her has since been released after a judge ruled there wasn't sufficient evidence in the case

'He tackled me to the ground and chocked me out and I fought him free,' she told the operator after escaping the teen last month and running back to her apartment. 'He grabbed my neck, so my neck is sore, but I’m OK.

'His body weight was too much for me to hold after running so we collapsed onto the pavement. His body was laying halfway on top of mine so I was pinned down to the ground.

'As all of this was happening, he said nothing. I then reached up with a free arm, grabbed the back of the male’s head and slammed it into the pavement approximately three times but he did not release his grip on my neck.

'I then pushed my thumb into his eye socket as hard as I could for about three seconds.'

After freeing herself, Ms Monasmith ran back to her apartment while the suspect continued on to a local YMCA where he was later arrested.

Ms Monasmith suffered cuts to her legs in the assault and has been attending counseling twice a week since the traumatic incident.

After hearing the judge's verdict on Wednesday, Ms Monasmith shook her head in disappointment.

'I’m absolutely disgusted by the procedures following the event and how the Bremerton Police Department handled it,' Ms Monasmith told Q13.

The prosecution based their case off Ms Monasmith's testimony and the account of responding police officers, which the judge found insufficient.

Detention officers deleted crucial evidence when they washed the suspects clothing after he was arrested.

'Any evidence of dirt or grit that might corroborate a scuffle on the blacktop driveway was not observed to or testified to,' said Mills.

However, Bremerton police maintain that they investigated the case by the book.

'We followed the rule of law,' said Lt. Pete Fisher with the Bremerton Police Department. 'We don’t have any say in how a judge rules on a certain case.'

Now Ms Monasmith worries that her attacker will find a new target.

'All he knows now is that it’s easy to get away with something like this,' Monasmith said.

The case can not be appealed.
