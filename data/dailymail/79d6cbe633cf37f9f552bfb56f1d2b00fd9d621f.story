A terrifying anonymous letter telling the founder of a not-for-profit to 'watch your back' also included threats against the woman's daughter, claiming they knew where she went to school. 

Lordina Jane, President and Founder of Palm Oil Investigations (POI) discovered the harrowing letter on Tuesday, ahead of the release of the POI app on Wednesday evening.

The free app - developed by the not-for-profit over the past 12 months - will inform consumers about the palm oil content of the products available on supermarket shelves.

'When I opened that letter I went cold... I took the letter and went straight to the police,' Lorinda told Daily Mail Australia.

This anonymous letter was sent to Palm Oil Investigations (POI) President Lorina Jane threatening her, and her daughter and claiming to know where they live

'It's a really gutless thing to do... The person who sent it has been that gutless they wouldn't put their name to it.'

Lorinda is the founder and president of the not-for-profit  which provides information to consumers about products that contain palm oil

Coming from an anonymous source, the letter made claims that should their company feature 'unfavourably' in the new app, 'we will be your worst enemy'.

'We know you are soon to release a phone app about products with palm oil in,' the letter began.

'If our company is listed unfavourably we will be your worst enemy.

'If our listing has a negative effect on our company, we know where you live, we know you have a daughter and we know where she goes to school. You will both need to watch your back,' it continued.

'You have bragged online that your app will be a ‘game changer’, it well may be only not how you expect,' the letter concluded,

Lorinda said in the years since the POI launched their Facebook page - which has over 144,000 'likes' - they have never encouraged any consumers to boycott particular brands, but are about simply providing information.

The letter, which was printed and not handwritten, and featured no company markings, is the first of its kind according to the POI founder.

Lorinda believes it could have come from a smaller brand they have contacted in the process of putting together their app - which acts as a barcode scanner and puts products into five categories.

The threats came a day ahead of the release of the POI app, which aims to inform consumers about the palm oil content of the products they consume

The first category is palm oil free, the second indicates the company has signed on to stop deforestation, the third is palm oil certified - which means they use ethically sourced oil, the fourth is for companies or products which used a mixed supply of certified and uncertified oil, and the final is a fail.

A fail means the company have refused to provide details when approached by POI, or that they use uncertified palm oil. 

'It is going to make big waves,' Lorinda said, speaking of the app.

'I don’t know what this person or company thinks they’re going to achieve. It's not the correct way to approach us'.

'Whoever it is is worried… in a way that’s a good thing because it shows the app is going to do exactly what it’s meant to,' she continued.

In recent years there has been controversy over illegal deforestation in south-east Asia

Animals such as orangutans, tigers and elephants are losing their natural habitats to the deforestation 

As a single mother to her young daughter, the POI founder said the letter was frightening, and it was now being investigated by detectives.

And she had a message for the anonymous sender: 'If they’re worried, why not send us a letter and say how are our brands sitting in that app … instead of sending something like that'.

A controversial ingredient in recent years, palm oil is used in a large amount of products found on supermarket shelves, from foods to beauty and cleaning products.

The issue surrounding the resource stems from the illegal deforestation of areas in Borneo and Sumatra, which is having a devastating impact on the animals that call these areas home.

Orangutans, tigers, rhinoceroses and elephants are among the native animals which face extinction as more and more land is cleared to harvest the cheap oil.

Harvesting the crops from which the oil comes from is not the issue at the centre of the debate, rather the uncertified and dangerous ways the resource is being collected and sold.
