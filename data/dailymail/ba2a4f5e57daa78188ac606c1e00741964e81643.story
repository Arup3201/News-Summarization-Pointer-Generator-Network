The spartan conditions faced by members of jailed Russian punk band Pussy Riot in a remote Russian prison have been revealed.

Nadezhda Tolokonnikova, who is pictured below, and Maria Alyokhina are forced to sew tunics onto police uniforms and abide by strict morning inspections as part of their daily routines in the bleak penal colonies deep in the Ural mountains.

The band members were convicted on hooliganism charges in August after
performing a 'punk prayer' at Moscow's main cathedral in protest against President Vladimir 
Putin and are serving two-year sentences.

A report by Russian newspaper Izvestia said Ms Tolokonnikova, 23, and bandmate Maria Alyokhina had
'successfully integrated' into prison life - although the newspaper is 
believed to have given a positive spin to the lifestyle faced by the 
women.

Ms Alyokhina is 
reported to have to use an outdoor toilet and, as a vegetarian, is 
finding it difficult to eat at the prison, in Mordovia, which is 
believed to have little access to fresh fruit and vegetables, the Times reports.

It is unusual for newspapers to be given access to reports from Russia's prisons. Mordovia is a region well
known in Russia for the Gulag camps here filled with tens of 
thousands of prisoners during the 1930s.

The
Russian Government is currently trying to fend off international 
criticism for its treatment of the Pussy Riot band members, whose 
performance in the cathedral was captured on video and viewed hundreds 
of thousands of times on You Tube.

Ms Tolokonnikova's husband, Pyotr Verzilov, was turned away by authorities when he tried to visit her at a prison camp in the village of Partsa in Mordovia

Three members of the band were jailed 
initially, but one, Yekaterina Samutsevich, was released on appeal last 
month, while Ms Tolokonnikova and Ms Alekhina, were sent to prison camps
to serve their sentences.

Prime
Minister Dmitry Medvedev said earlier this month that he detested the 
Pussy Riot act, but added the women have been in prison long enough and 
should be released.

He made a similar statement before October's appeal hearings, fueling speculation about their possible release.

Medvedev's
latest comment is unlikely to take effect, since he is widely seen as a
liberal yet nominal government figure whose pledges and orders are 
seldom followed through on.

The
band members' imprisonment has come to symbolise intolerance of dissent
in Putin's Russia and led to strong international condemnation. Their 
cause has been taken up by celebrities and musicians, including Madonna 
and Paul McCartney, and protests have been held around the world.

Mr Verzilov said his wife has been treated well by prison officials, but he attributed that to the publicity stirred up by the trial
