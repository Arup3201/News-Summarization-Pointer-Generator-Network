Amir Khan faces off against Devon Alexander on Friday - in a meeting of the scales rather than fists.

The pair will stand toe-to-toe at the customary weigh-in before fight night at the MGM Grand Garden in Las Vegas.

Khan and Alexander are both former champions in the 140lb light-welterweight division but have both made the step up to 147lbs in recent years.

28-year-old Khan has only fought once previously at this weight, which heralded a stellar performance against the experienced Luis Collazo in May.

The Bolton-born boxer will be hoping for a similar outcome against 27-year-old Alexander on Saturday - at the same venue that he beat Collazo.

In only his second fight as welterweight, Alexander won the IBF world title with a unanimous decision over Randall Bailey but subsequently lost his belt two fights later against Shawn Porter.

Both fighters will be looking to produce a knockout performance in the hoping of landing a dream fight against either Floyd Mayweather or Manny Pacquiao. 

Khan v Alexander will be televised live on Sky Sports late this Saturday night.
