With gunshots ringing out amid screams and terrified shoppers diving for cover, this dramatic video today revealed the first moments of the deadly terrorist attack on a Kenyan shopping mall.

The clip, taken yesterday by a journalist for CCTV Africa at the Westgate shopping centre in Nairobi, shows some people running or cowering behind shelves and boxes as others are heard shouting.

Later on in the 90-second video - which was posted on YouTube at 7pm tonight - a man can be seen behind a door in the mall speaking on his mobile phone and saying: 'They think they are terrorists'.

Shocking: The clip was taken yesterday by a journalist for CCTV Africa at the Westgate shopping centre

At the start: Some witnesses were seen cowering behind shelves and boxes as the terrorist attack began

It comes as Kenya's Red Cross said the
 death toll from the militant attack on the upscale mall in the 
country's capital had risen to 68 after nine more bodies were recovered 
in a joint rescue mission.

Officials
 say more than 175 people were wounded in the attack, which saw gunmen 
use grenades and assault rifles. Somali militant group al-Shabab has 
already claimed responsibility for the killings.

An
 estimated 10 to 15 militants remain in the mall holding an unknown 
number of captives. The Kenyan military has entered the four-story mall 
and there have been sporadic gun battles.

Some
 Kenyan military personnel were seen carrying in at least two rocket 
propelled grenades. Earlier military helicopters hovered over the mall.

Associated Press journalists at the Westgate mall said that a large explosion rocked the mall this afternoon and was by far the largest in the 30-hour siege. The blast was followed by silence.

Security officials were unable to say how many people were being held captive by the terrorists. Kenya's Red Cross said in a statement citing police that 49 people had been reported missing.

Officials did not make an explicit link but that number could form the basis of the number of people held captive. The attackers specifically targeted non-Muslims and included some women.

CCTV Africa is a division of China Central Television, launched in Kenya in January of last year.
