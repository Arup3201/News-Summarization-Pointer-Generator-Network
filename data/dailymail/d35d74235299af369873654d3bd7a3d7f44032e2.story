Boston marathon bombing survivor Jeff Bauman Jr. had a bright spot when he was visited by actor Bradley Cooper and New England Patriots wide receiver Julian Edelman.

Bauman was recovering at Boston Medical Centre when he was visited by the Hangover Star and the football player.

'Visited #survivor #stud #hero Jeffrey Bauman Jr.
today. He was looking great and is a true inspiration. #strong,' Edelman tweeted.

Bauman lost both his legs below the knees in the explosion near the finish line.

One
of the most shocking and recognizable images of the event shows Bauman 
being wheeled to a medical tent with both legs destroyed by the blast.

He still managed to describe one of the bombers to the FBI, despite his horrific injuries.

Cooper also took time to visit Sydney and Celeste Corcoran, who were both horribly injured in the blast.

An account at the Go Fund Me site to raise money for mother and daughter's medical recovery has raised $391,100.

The site recounted Cooper's visit: 'He was so sweet and kind to everyone – from the nurses and doctors to 
each person in the hallway trying to meet him or take his picture.'

Smith rushed to Sydney's aid after shrapnel tore into her legs. A relative said the family 'owes' the good Samaritan 'unspeakable gratitude'

Like Bauma, Syndey is featured in one of the most recognizable images to come from the attacks, captured with her limbs shredded by shrapnel as a stranger comes to her aid.

Sydney's femoral artery was ruptured and her mother was so badly hurt that both legs had to be amputated.

The man good samaritan who saved her life, Matt Smith, also visited her and is now considered 'part of the family.'

'It was so touching to see them hug, talk and hold hands,' the family noted in a blog post. 'We are so
incredibly grateful to him and he was as gracious in person as you’d 
expect a real-life superhero to be. Here are a few photos of their 
reunion'

Cooper and Edelman follow several other high profile visitors, including President Obama has also visited the bedside of dozens of Boston Marathon bombing victims.

Among those Obama visited was Karen Rand - who lost her best friend in the horrific blasts.

After attending the interfaith service in Boston on Thursday morning, he visited with hospitalized victims still recovering from the devastating twin blasts.

Miss Rand was one of them. She was waiting near the finish line with her best friend Krystle Campbell to cheer on Karen's boyfriend when the first explosion hit.

Krystle was killed in the blast. Karen will survive.

Krystle, a 29-year-old steakhouse manager who went to the race every year, was the second fatal victim to be identified.

Doctors initially told Krystle's father, William Campbell Jr., that his daughter had survived.

But doctors had mistaken her for 
Karen, because she was carrying Krystle's identification they were 
unable to correct the mistake while she was in surgery.

Campbell
spent 12 hours believing his daughter was alive and only learned the 
truth after going into the post-operating room and saw Karen lying there
instead.

'We had the doctors come out and tell us everything they did [to save Karen] — and it wasn't our daughter,' Campbell said.

Krystle went to marathon, which she did every year, and was with Rand, cheering on Rand’s boyfriend.

They were struck by the first blast as they waited near the finish line.

William
Campbell rushed to the hospital and felt relieved when doctors said 
they were operating on their daughter's leg at Massachusetts General 
Hospital.

Victim: Krystle Campbell's parents had believed she survived for 12 hours and only learned she had died after going into the hospital room and finding Miss Rand instead

But when nurses brought him into a post-operating room around 2am and saw Rand instead.

'I said, "That’s not my daughter, that’s Karen! Where’s my daughter?" The doctors were as shocked as we were,' Campbell said.

A Boston detective later showed them a photo of Krystle, who worked as a manager at Jimmy's Steakhouse.

'I almost passed out on the floor,' Mr Campbell said as he was about to view his daughter's body.
