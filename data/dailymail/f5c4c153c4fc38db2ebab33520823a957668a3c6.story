A dream beach house in Florida has turned into a nightmare for a Missouri couple after the $680,000, five-bedroom home was built on the wrong lot.

Six months after the custom house was built along the Atlantic Ocean near Palm Coast,   Mark and Brenda Voss learned it's on the wrong lot in the gated Ocean Hammock community.

Mark Voss tells the Daytona Beach News Journal they're in 'total disbelief.'

Custom-made disaster: Six months after their custom house was built along the Atlantic Ocean near Palm Coast, owners Mark and Brenda Voss learned it's on the wrong lot in the gated Ocean Hammock community

Big, misplaced house: The Florida dream home boasts five bedrooms and over 5,000 square feet of living space

'We may have moved (to Ocean Hammock) someday. But, with this headache and grief, we're not so sure. The Midwest is looking pretty good right now,' he said.

The couple own 18 other residential lots in the community, but the mistake managed to be made on a lot owned by someone else.

They bought the lot in 2012 for $160,000 and hired Keystone Homes to build a three-story, 5,000-square-foot vacation rental.

The other lot was purchased for $355,000 by a North Carolina couple way back in 2003.

Keystone and Voss say the error can be traced to a 2013 survey. The mistake was uncovered in September after the house had been rented frequently. 

Tough mistake to make: While the Voss family own over a dozen lots in the Ocean Hammock community, the builders managed to build on one owned by another couple--one that cost a great deal more

In June 2012 the Vosses purchased the lot of 23 Ocean Ridge Blvd for $160,000.

They then commissioned Keystone Homes to build the 5,000 square-foot home to be used as a vacation rental but the contractors mistakenly began construction next door at 21 Ocean Ridge Blvd. North.

Andrew Massaro and his wife Brooke Triplett, who live in Ocean Isle Beach, North Carolina purchased that lot in 2003 for $355,000, but never built their own property there.

Keystone claim the mistake is down to a land survey conducted last year when a simple mistake led to the wrong lot being assessed.

Mark Boyce, who is Flagler County's chief building official, told The Ledger in Florida that the mistake, though regretable, is understandable.

He says the west side of Ocean Ridge Blvd North has a long stretch of around 10 vacant lots all with short grass, with no clear landmarks or markers for builders or surveyors.

Keystone vice president Robbie Richmond says the company is trying to negotiate a settlement. The couple hired a lawyer. 

'We are in the process of trying to schedule a conference call and find a fair resolution without the lawyers,' Richmond said. 'I have built about 600 homes in Flagler County and this has never happened to me before. It does happen, but it's rare.'

We are 100 percent committed to finding a resolution that is fair,' he said.

What that resolution will be remains to be seen. Richmond thinks the best solution would be for the owners to switch lot, but Voss sounds as if he could be open to other fixes.

'We have some ideas and plans, but I'm not going to discuss them here,' Voss said. 'We're working all channels to deal with this. We have an attorney.'
