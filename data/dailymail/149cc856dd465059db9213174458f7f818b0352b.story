Anti-capitalist protests returned to St Paul’s yesterday, with four women in white invading the cathedral and chaining themselves to the pulpit.

They cut themselves free at about 10pm after more than six hours inside, after police warned that they faced being arrested.

The incident follows a protest camp outside the cathedral which began a year ago today. Both were organised by the Occupy movement.

A message on the group’s Twitter page 
claimed solidarity with Russia’s Pussy Riot protesters, who were jailed 
for a demonstration inside a Moscow church in February.

Protester Josie Reid, 52, said: ‘I know if Jesus was walking on the earth today he would be with us.

‘He was not afraid to stand up and speak out. And this is what we want our Church leaders to do.’

The rest of the St Paul’s quartet were
unemployed mother-of-three Tammy Samede, 30; actress Alison Playford, 
30; and Siobhan Grimes, 25, who works for the charity Homeless Action.

After disrupting the start of the 
evensong service with chants, they quietened for the rest – and 
requested communion, which they received while chained to the pulpit.

The group, which criticised St Paul’s 
for accepting money from the bank Goldman Sachs, wielded an umbrella 
spray-painted with the slogan: ‘Throw the money-changers out of the 
temple.’

Other Occupy members unfurled a 
banner with the same slogan on the cathedral’s steps.

One of the four 
inside asked: ‘How can you possibly take money from these people?

'Christianity will not die if you cannot keep the cathedral open. You 
don’t need this money.’

The Dean of St Paul’s, the Very 
Reverend Dr David Ison, responded: ‘We are already asking questions 
about that [sources of funding] and we will continue to do so.’

He told the protesters they had been 
‘discourteous’ to interrupt the service, but added: ‘Ultimately what we 
are working for and what you are working for is going in the same 
direction.’

Dr Ison said: ‘We disagree with the 
way in which some protesters are continuing to pursue the agenda of 
conflict with St Paul’s, rather than consulting with us.’

Occupy London called for the 
leadership of St Paul’s to ‘stop sitting on the fence and join the fight
against rising inequality in the UK and beyond’.

One Occupy member gave
a speech on the cathedral steps. ‘We will not be silenced,’ he said.

‘One year ago tomorrow Occupy arrived on your doorstep and pitched our 
tents in the tradition of St Paul. In the fight for economic justice 
Jesus threw the money-changers from the temple.

‘But you invited them in and instead 
evicted us. You testified against us, which acted to uphold injustice 
and inequality, which is growing by the day.’

Last night a member said the 
protesters had left the cathedral after ‘awareness-raising’. They added 
that Dr Ison has ‘agreed to meet them and talk’.

Hundreds of people set up camp outside
St Paul’s last year after they were prevented from entering nearby 
Paternoster Square, where the London Stock Exchange is located.

The camp was dismantled in February after the protesters lost a court battle with the local authorities.

Mark Clarke of the City of London 
council, who was elected on an anti-Occupy ticket, said: ‘I am appalled 
to see Occupy back at St Paul’s.

‘Last time they were here they 
vandalised the cathedral and even defecated in the grounds. Yet again 
they’ve substituted political debate for cheap stunts and thuggery.

‘The problem is that the cathedral took a softly softly approach last time, and now they’re seen as a soft touch.’

He claimed protesters ‘want to be arrested so they can say they’re Britain’s Pussy Riot’.
