What price a World Cup? The bottom line for FIFA is that Brazil 2014 will earn the world governing body at least £2.55billion.

By the next tournament, in Russia in 2018, that will have jumped above £3bn to cap an extraordinary doubling in income between 2006 and 2018.

As the new issue of specialist sports business journal Sportcal Insight details, TV income for this summer’s event alone will be about £1.5bn.

German and Italian broadcasters are paying £163million each, the French around £122m, the BBC and ITV combined around £120m for UK rights, and US broadcasters £150m.

That is set to soar in 2018 and beyond. The World Cup is uniquely popular, with roughly a third of the planet’s seven billion population expected to watch at least one of the 64 games on television.

The final in Rio will be the most watched event of any kind in the world in 2014, and it is expected that the average global audience per match this summer will easily top 150m. Last time the average was 188m per match.

Such an extraordinary reach means FIFA can attract some of the biggest brands in the world aspartners and sponsors.

Adidas have paid £120m to be partners for the current four-year cycle up to Brazil 2014.

Visa and Emirates are each paying £66.8m, Coca-Cola £75m, and Hyundai and Sony also spending tens of millions.

McDonald’s, Budweiser and a raft of others are also paying to be associated with the beautiful game, meaning FIFA will earn £733m at least from commercial deals this summer.

Excited: It seems the entire world has got in the Samba mood for Brazil 2014 with less than a week to go

2.2 BILLION - number of people in the world (31 per cent of 7bn) who watched at least one World Cup match in 2010 on TV

188.4 MILLION - the average live global TV audience per World Cup match. The World Cup is like 64 Super Bowls in a month, except every one is bigger

530.9 MILLION - the live global TV audience for the 2010 World Cup final

17.3 MILLION - the average viewers per match in Brazil for 2010 World Cup, rising to an average of 44m for Brazil games

5.3 MILLION - average UK TV audience for 2010 World Cup

17.9 MILLION - the highest audience for England vs Germany

Ticket sales, hospitality packages and merchandise will add another £315m.

Where all this money goes is a different matter entirely. FIFA distribute much of it around the world to associations and development projects.

Unquantifiable amounts go on expenses for FIFA executives. And more than a billion dollars is sitting in FIFA’s bank account.
