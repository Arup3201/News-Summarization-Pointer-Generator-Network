With his cute whiskers and glossy fur, he looks as gentle and benign as could be.

When he’s not indoors being petted by his owners, you’d probably expect Shiny the tom to be playing in the garden, perhaps chasing the occasional bird.

But things aren’t quite so perfect  in the Cornish village of Little Treviscoe, where he lives.

Mean face: Shiny the four-year-old male cat who has terrorised the neighbourhood of Little Treviscoe, St Austell

Neighbours say Shiny is terrorising 
the area and have branded him ‘devil cat’. Police have been called five 
times over his violent behaviour, which has left locals and their pets 
in need of medical treatment.

They want the four-year-old cat to be put down.

His owners, however, insist he is innocent and the injured must have done something to provoke him.

Police
 are powerless to act because laws designed to combat dangerous dogs 
don’t apply to cats. Paula Burton was taken to A&E in July after 
Shiny ran into her home and sank his claws into her arms and legs. The 
42-year-old had bruising and cuts that required antibiotics.

She
 said: ‘He was hanging off my arm by his claws. He eventually let go and
 ran away but I had to go to hospital as my arm had become quite 
swollen. I love cats and I’d never normally complain – but this animal 
is out of control.’

Neighbour
 Carol Ballsdon said Shiny clawed her 90-year-old mother. She said: ‘She
 had a large skin tear down the arm, which we had to dress every day for
 three weeks, and two big puncture wounds on the back of her leg. It is 
just four sets of claws and a set of teeth coming at you.’

Another local said she used to use water to shoo Shiny away but has also had to throw hot tea over him.

Julia
 Terry, 43, said: ‘It launched off the fence and attached itself to my 
arm. I had to throw hot tea over it.’ Shiny has also laid into cats and 
dogs, costing owners vets’ bills.

Helen Wade’s elderly cat was attacked a couple of weeks ago by Shiny and was left with gaping cuts.

The
 34-year-old carer said: ‘We’re living in misery – he’s like a devil 
cat. We’ve had a fence and a gate put in our front garden to try and 
stop him coming in, but he persists.

‘The
 laws need to be changed so the same rules apply for cats as they do 
dogs. If a cat attacks a person, they should be put down.’

Terrifying: Shiny has been branded Britain's most ferocious feline after  putting residents and pets in hospital

Shiny’s
 owners Mandie and Adrian Knowles, who live in the village with their 
three children, have had him since he was a kitten. They say they had 
Shiny neutered after Miss  Burton was attacked.

Mrs
 Knowles, 32, a learning support student, said: ‘I know people had 
problems with Shiny before but since he’s been neutered we’ve seen no 
signs of violent behaviour.

‘He’s
 an outdoor cat but will come inside and have his food around our 
two-year-old Poppy – we’ve never had any issues with our children. These
 people must have done something for him to act that way. He wouldn’t 
attack them out of the blue.

‘We’ve
 had the police knocking on our door about five times, and have had the 
RSPCA here – it’s getting ridiculous. The RSPCA found no problem with 
Shiny.’

Her 34-year-old 
husband, a dispatch supervisor, said: ‘It’s getting unfair on Shiny. If 
we genuinely thought this cat was attacking innocent people we would 
have him put down.’
