The FBI and Homeland Security have warned police forces across the country to be on the lookout for terrorist threats as a chilling note was posted online warning that Chicago could be an ISIS target.

The federal agencies sent a bulletin on Friday to law enforcement agencies warning them to be on the lookout for terrorism.

Although no specific threats have been identified, they could not guarantee no future attacks, the federal agencies said.

A chilling  was posted on Twitter on June 20 purportedly from someone with a connection to extremist group ISIS. It featured a picture of the White House and the Old Republic Building in Chicago

The message, reportedly from ISIS, read: 'We are in your state/We are in your cities/We are in your streets/You are our goals anywhere'

According to ABC, the bulletin read: 'Because of the individualized nature of the radicalization process – it is difficult to predict triggers that will contribute to [homegrown violent extremists] attempting acts of violence.'

It went on to say that lone operatives would provide police very few opportunities to detect and stop the potential mayhem and destruction they were plotting. 

Chicago in particular has become a prime target because extremist groups think of it as 'Obama Town', a security expert told CBS. 

A tweet, posted on June 20, has been discovered, showing pictures of the Old Republic Building in Chicago and the White House with a message reportedly from the Islamic State (ISIS or ISIL).

 It reads: 'We are in your state/We are in your cities/We are in your streets/You are our goals anywhere.' 

The brutal capabilities of ISIS were revealed on Tuesday after a stomach-churning video released showed the beheading of American photojournalist James Foley at the hands of a hooded militant. 

At a press briefing on Thursday, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said the U.S. military's job is to 'get ready' for whatever battle might lie ahead. 

ISIS is 'as sophisticated and well-funded as any group that we have seen,' Hagel said, appearing alongside Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Martin Dempsey.

'They're beyond just a terrorist group,' Hagel said. 'They marry ideology and a sophistication of strategic and tactical military prowess. They are tremendously well-funded. ...This is beyond anything we've seen, so we must prepare for everything.'

'It's a long-term threat,' he conceded under questioning from reporters, adding moments later that 'the president has been very clear on mission creep. And he's made it very clear that he will not allow that.'

Gen. Dempsey warned that America's involvement in Iraq will continue for years to come, citing the intensity of hatred among ethnic, religious and tribal groups there.

'The conflict against those groups – most of which are local, some of which are regional, and some of which are global in nature – that's going to be a very long contest,' he said.

'It's ideological. It's not political. It's religious in many cases. So, yes, it's going to be a very long contest.'

A U.S. senator also said on Thursday that ISIS, the militant terror group sweeping across Iraq, aims to destroy an American city and is working on a plan to do it.

'They're crazy out there and they're rapidly developing a method of blowing up a major U.S. city and people just can't believe that's happening,' Republican Senator Jim Inhofe told the Fox-25 television in Oklahoma City.

Inhofe, the ranking GOP member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, warned that leaders of ISIS 'are really bad terrorists. They're so bad even al-Qaeda is afraid of them'. 

Representative Jim Bridenstine, a fellow Oklahoma Republican and a committee member, told the Tulsa World that ISIS Islamists are 'cutting children's bodies in half. They're shooting them. I've never seen anything like it.'   

A frustrated Inhofe also said on Thursday night that he feared President Obama isn't up to the task, despite the tough words he delivered on Wednesday before hitting the golf course.

'Obama's lofty rhetoric is undermined by fainthearted follow-through and lack of meaningful action,' he told the World. 

'The president's limited strikes in Iraq have not halted ISIS' momentum but only temporarily redirected it,' said Inhofe. 'Without sustained pressure, ISIS will regroup and continue its campaign of terror.'  

'We're in the most dangerous position we've ever been in as a nation,'he told Fox-25. 

The president told a global audience this week from his Martha's Vineyard vacation spot that the U.S. 'will continue to do what we must do to protect our people.'

'We will be vigilant and we will be relentless. When people harm Americans, anywhere, we do what's necessary to see that justice is done.'

'We act against ISIL, standing alongside others,' Obama added, hinting at his 'coalition' strategy rather than a plan to strike unilaterally with overwhelming American force.

Inhofe, though, warned that without a concrete plan, Obama's words ring hollow.

'You have to come up with something that we're going to do,' the senator said, 'because they're holding another hostage in place.'

'And the problem is, the president, quite frankly – he says all these things and he never does them.' 

With the right strategy, he added, the U.S. could defeat ISIS on its home turf before the threat arrives on America's doorstep.

'This idea that they're coming and infiltrating the United States – sure, some are coming in who have had an association with ISIS. But the majority of them are still over there,' he said. 

The senator also defended the United States government's sweeping intelligence programs that have drawn barbs from civil libertarians, suggesting that information dragnets would play a part in keeping ISIS at bay.

'You have to have an intelligence process going on to stop attacks on America,' he said.
