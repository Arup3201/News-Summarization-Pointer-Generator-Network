Most women will bin unwanted beauty gifts worth an average of £26 this Christmas.

That adds up to a staggering £676m nationally, according to the latest study.

They know exactly what they like and don't like so if Santa brings something that's not on their list, they simply won't use it - regardless of cost.

Bin it: Women will throw out millions of pounds worth of unwanted beauty products this Christmas

The average woman will throw away two Christmas beauty gifts, worth an average £26.36 and one in five admit they'll chuck out 'wrong' gifts that cost friends or relatives £60.

If the cosmetics aren't right they'll bin them during the rest of the year - one a month on average.

It may have cost a fortune, or taken weeks to find, but if it's the wrong shade, or not the preferred brand, it'll end up in the bin.

Women shopping for themselves buy three new beauty products a month but stick firmly to the tried and tested brands they know and trust.

More than seven out of 10 women say they continue to buy the same beauty products because of 'positive usage' whereas just 12.4 per cent buy on the recommendation of others.

A further 18.5 per cent buy the same beauty brands out of loyalty and some 24.7 per cent buy the same brands because of habit.

The national study by teeth whitening brand BlanX did offer a glimmer of hope for Britain's menfolk though.

If totally bemused by the sheer plethora of beauty products available in the marketplace, play it safe and plump for bath and body goodies - the No1 Christmas beauty choice among British women.

Failing that, make-up comes in a close second and fragrance is third most popular - just be sure that you know which brand your lady prefers or you may as well stuff your hard-earned cash straight in the litter bin.

Louise Mark, of BlanX, said: 'British women are very loyal to their favourite brands and tend to want to stick with the beauty products they know and love.

'They very rarely choose a new beauty product based on a recommendation from others and choose their make-up and other beauty essentials out of habit, loyalty and, most importantly, because it has had a positive result for them in the past.

'Men need to be aware that it is easy to get it wrong when buying beauty products for their ladies at Christmas and British women are not scared of being ruthless when it comes to their beauty regime.

'If it doesn't work for them, no matter how much it cost or who bought it for them, it's going to end up in the bin.

'The same as £676 Million worth of other beauty products this Christmas.'
