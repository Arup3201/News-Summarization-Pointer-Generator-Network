A detective broke into a sleeping woman's home and raped her after she had turned him away at the end of a date, a court heard today.

The prosecution claim detective sergeant Trevor Gray forced the security chain on the front door of his alleged victim’s house, then made his way upstairs and attacked her as she slept.

The jury was told that minutes earlier, Gray, 47, had sent a text message to the woman from the street outside, which read 'You are harsh', after she asked him to leave so she could go to bed.

Derby Crown Court was told the pair, who met through mutual friends, had been out for drinks earlier that evening before sharing a cab. 

But the 43-year-old said she was 'shocked' when Gray got out of the taxi at her house in Mapperley, Nottingham.

Jurors heard she invited him in out of 'courtesy' for no more than 15 minutes, before telling him she was tired and asking him to go.

But Steven Coupland, prosecuting, said this 'upset' Gray’s plans to have sex with the woman - and minutes after leaving he returned.

Mr Coupland said: 'He tried to call her but she ignored his calls, and texted and asked her to get him a cab.

'Instead of him calling a cab himself, he decided to return to her address despite the fact it had been made plain he was being asked to leave. 

'He rang the bell. He did not take the message. He found the door was not locked but had the security chain on to make it secure.

'What he did was the force that chain. He went upstairs to where she was sleeping and went into her room. She woke to find he was on top of her.'

The court heard the woman had a 'limited recollection' of what happened next, despite only having a small number of drinks while out with Gray, who has been suspended from Nottinghamshire Police.

But Mr Coupland said she recalled he tried to get her to touch him intimately, before raping her. 

Jurors were told the next memory the woman had was waking up at 5.30am to find Gray still in bed with her.

Giving evidence, she told the court she was left feeling 'terrified', and like a 'prisoner in her own home', unable to confront Gray, who was acting 'as though nothing had happened', because her young child was there. 

The woman said Gray appeared to be unaware she was 'uncomfortable' - even when she asked him several times how he had got into her home during the night.

She eventually plucked up the courage to call him a taxi, and as he was leaving, spotted the broken security chain. She told the jury Gray said, 'Don’t worry, I’ll fix it', causing her to lose her temper and push him out of the house.

The court heard that later that day, she told a friend her version of what had happened, then called Gray 'to go through the sequence of events'. However, she said Gray appeared 'cold', and when he asked her 'Does this put you off me?', she hung up.

The following day, she spoke with a police officer friend, who reported the matter to her superiors.

The court heard that after his arrest, Gray claimed he had returned to the woman’s home and found her door ajar before forcing his way in because he 'thought something might have happened to her'.

Mr Coupland said Gray told officers he then made his way upstairs and was invited to stay by his alleged victim, who was an 'active participant' in sex. The court heard Gray added that the pair had 'parted on good terms' with a kiss on the doorstep, and had no idea anything was wrong until he received her phone call.

Jurors were told the pair had met on a night out with mutual friends around a month before the alleged attack, on July 24 last year.

They swapped phone numbers and exchanged 'jokey' texts before meeting for a drink.

The woman said Gray appeared 'articulate, funny and pleasant', and they met again in Nottingham City Centre.

But she said that despite only having three glasses of wine and lemonade, and a 'strong-tasting' vodka and coke bought for her by Gray, she could not remember much of the evening.

She told the jury she had a 'vague recollection' of being unable to understand why Gray got out at her house.

The woman added: 'I never invite people back to my house. Even if I have decided someone is okay, it is not something I do. I did not even find him attractive.

'I vaguely remember saying he needed to go, I needed to go to bed, and he needed to get a taxi from the top of the road. He went out the back door.

'My memory is of locking the door and putting the chain on. I remember being woken by the bell ringing lots and lots of times. I just ignored it and went back to sleep.

'The next thing, I was aware of a naked person. He was over me. I was in bed. It was not what I wanted.'

Gray, of Nottingham, denies rape, attempted rape, and sexual assault.

The trial continues.
