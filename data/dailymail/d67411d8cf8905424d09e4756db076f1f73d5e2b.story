If you aren’t quite in the Christmas spirit yet then maybe this viral video from Canadian low-cost carrier WestJet will help.

The airline claims to have spent the past four months putting together its Christmas Miracle stunt, in which passengers got to tell Santa Claus what they want before catching their flight and hey presto it was there waiting for them at the other end of their journey.

The video was uploaded onto YouTube on Sunday and depending on your seasonal cheer levels, it is either a heart-warming reminder of what Christmas is all about or a shameless attempt by an airline to milk the holidays for all they can in a shamelessly icky promo stunt.

Passengers flying with Canadian low-cost carrier WestJet got an early Christmas surprise when they got to ask Santa for gifts as they boarded and then collected the presents at their destination

Air travel during the holidays is typically a nightmare of cancelled flights and lounges overflowing with harassed passengers, but in WestJet’s alternative universe the whole experience looks a lot more relaxed and even fun.

Passengers flying to Calgary from Toronto and Hamilton were filmed asking a virtual Santa Claus what they wanted for Christmas while still in the departure lounge.

The video shows a variety of passengers – young and old – take it in turns to tell Father Christmas about the gift they most what before boarding their flights.

Then we get to see behind-the-scenes as an army of 150 volunteers rush to the nearest retail park to fill their vehicles full of all the requested presents. 

While the passengers enjoy their apparently relaxing flights, the WestJet elves are busy getting the presents to the airport and wrapping them up

While the passengers enjoy their apparently relaxing flights, the WestJet elves are busy getting the presents to the airport, wrapping them up and ensuring that each package has the name of the person who asked Santa for it.

After the passengers finally touch down in Calgary we see them milling around baggage reclaim, which has been decorated to look as seasonal as possible with giant gingerbread men and even fake snow.

Then the baggage carousel starts up and rather than their luggage, the passengers are greeted with individual gift boxes containing their specially-requested Christmas gifts.

The footage of the passengers opening their presents is very touching, especially a young boy who looks super excited to receive an Android tablet and a young family get the biggest present – a big screen TV, looking slightly less impressed is the poor guy who only gets some socks and underwear.

He and some of the other must be regretting that they didn’t set their sights a little higher, after all they knew they were being filmed for a Christmas Miracle stunt.

'This year, we wanted to turn our holiday campaign into a tradition by doing something that's never been done before,' explained WestJet spokesperson Richard Bartrem. 

'Inspired by the notion of real-time giving, we wanted to surprise our guests with meaningful, personalized gifts when they least expected them. Being able to show our guests how much we care with gift-giving, a tried and true holiday tradition, resonates with WestJetters as much as our guests.' 

As the video accumulates viewings, the airline has promised to donate flights to families in need.
