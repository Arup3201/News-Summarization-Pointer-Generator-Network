Accused: Hannah Bonser when she appeared at magistrates court earlier this year accused of killing Casey Kearney, 13, at a park in Doncaster

As a sensible 13-year-old, Casey Kearney had been allowed by her mother to travel alone to visit a friend for a sleepover.

But her treat ended in tragedy when she encountered former psychiatric patient Hannah Bonser.

As the pair – who had never met – passed  each other in a park, 26-year-old Bonser  plunged a large kitchen knife into the schoolgirl’s chest before calmly walking off, a court heard yesterday.

Casey managed to ring 999 on her mobile phone and collapsed. She was helped by passers-by and rushed to hospital, but died that evening.

‘The attack was sudden and caught Casey completely unawares,’ prosecutor Graham Reeds, QC, said. ‘There was no argument, no shouting and no warning that anything was about to happen.’

Bonser, who was said to have a ‘troubled history’, had been treated in a psychiatric hospital four months earlier and had been involved with an organisation helping those with mental health problems.

Just three days before the attack she told a friend she was going to stab her ex-boyfriend to death because he made her have an abortion years ago and she was ‘going to get anyone else who crossed her in her life,’ Sheffield Crown Court was told.

There was also evidence from damage to the door of her flat that Bonser ‘practised inflicting a stab wound’ to someone of a similar height to Casey.

After walking out of the park in Doncaster with the ‘murder’ weapon – which she had bought earlier that day – hidden up her sleeve, the defendant went to the offices of the mental health charity Rethink and told a member of staff she knew that she had killed someone, the court was told.

The worker immediately rang police and
told the operator: ‘She’s been out at a park and she’s passed a girl on
the park and she’s stabbed her.’ Bonser denies murder and the court 
heard that her defence is likely to argue her crime was that of 
manslaughter due to diminished responsibility.

Casey was killed on Valentine’s Day this year as she travelled to stay with a friend during half-term.

Described as ‘very sensible and mature
for her age,’ she was allowed to travel alone by bus and was texting 
her friend during the journey.

Mr Reeds said she was stabbed once and
the six-inch blade cut an artery, causing severe internal bleeding that
made the damage ‘irreversible and unsurvivable’.

The schoolgirl and the defendant were 
walking in opposite directions through Elmfield Park and the attack 
happened just yards from a children’s playground.

Attack: Casey, pictured at a family event holding a baby, managed to call police after she was stabbed

Casey’s last text was sent at 1.11pm 
and her 999 call after the stabbing was made seven minutes later.

Two 
ten-year-olds who had been close by were said to have heard no screams 
and noticed no signs of a struggle.

Moments later Casey was spotted on her
knees ‘as if she were looking for a lost earring or a dropped phone’. 
In reality she was close to losing consciousness. There were no signs of
blood and the women who found her initially thought she was ‘having a 
fit’ rather than the victim of a stabbing.

It was only when paramedics arrived 
that the seriousness of her condition became clear.

Kerry Berry came 
across Casey lying on the ground and put her in the recovery position. 
She said: ‘Her hair was all over her face.

‘I moved her hair back and stroked her face.

‘She was foaming at the mouth so I thought she was fitting.’

Mr Reeds said psychiatrists on both sides would give evidence about Bonser’s mental state.

He said she should be convicted of 
murder, telling the jury that despite her ‘troubled’ background and a 
history of ‘mental difficulties’, she ‘managed to look after herself and
lived independently’ and her ability to do so was ‘not substantially 
impaired’.

A friend apparently thought her behaviour had been odd since last summer.

In September last year, the court 
heard, Bonser was caught in the street with a kitchen knife in her coat 
pocket and the following month spent a short time in a psychiatric 
hospital in Doncaster. She lived alone and was said to want to move to a
safer area.

Bonser bought two kitchen knives less 
than three hours before the killing and was carrying them both when she 
handed herself in.

Mr Reeds said there was ‘no other discernible purpose other than to use as weapons in a stabbing’.

He added: ‘As to why she did it, the prosecution say only she knows, and she is not saying.’

Violence: The injured teenager managed to stagger away after the attack in Elmfield Park, Doncaster and dialled 999

Bonser refused to answer police 
questions and her solicitor told police ‘she’s hearing voices telling 
her to do things and not to do things’.

The court also heard a statement from 
Casey’s mother Kerry Day, 32, who recalled how when her daughter had 
left the house they said ‘I love you’ to each other. The trial continues.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
