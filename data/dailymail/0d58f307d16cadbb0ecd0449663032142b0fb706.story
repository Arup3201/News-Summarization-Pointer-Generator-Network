America's secretive spy agency, the National Reconnaissance Office, has been in possession of two space telescopes which are better than Hubble - and has now decided to gift them to NASA.

Sources say that the reason for the 
hand-me-down is because the NRO - motto: 'Vigilance from above' - has 
found even better technology.

The revelations leads to questions over how long the NRO has had the satellites - which are said to have 100 times the field of view of Hubble - and what exactly they were planning to use them for.

The space agency has confirmed that 
it received a pair of giant identical Hubble telescopes, and said the 
spy agency built them and then decided it didn't need them.

So, having decided they had no use 
for them, the NRO has now gifted the pair, which have been sat in their 
original wrappers in a warehouse in Rochester, New York, to the space 
agency.

The trouble is, NASA is too cash-strapped to refurbish them - until at least 2024.

Even with this windfall, NASA has no money to launch the telescopes anytime soon. They have consistently been dealing with smaller budgets and fewer staff members. 

The transfer last summer was only recently declassified.

The telescopes have mirrors similar in size to the famed Hubble Space Telescope, but they are not ready for space - not by a long shot.

For starters, they lack cameras and instruments essential for astronomy research. The equipment costs money - around $1billion, according to some estimates.

Dr Spergel, a member of the National Academy of Science’s Committee on Astrophysics and Astronomy told Time: ‘A 50 per cent discount still means you have to come up with the other 50 per cent.’

NASA astrophysics director Paul Hertz told the Washington Post that the soonest NASA could hope to launch the telescopes was in 2024, but said they might launch earlier ‘if money is no object.’

He added that the initial framework means less overhead, and more that can potentially be spent on newer technologies. In total, the massive gifts will likely save the space agency some $250million down the road.

However, until scientists have enough money for launches, the telescopes will remain in the upstate New York warehouse.

Neither the NRO or NASA would release pictures of the two telescopes.

Scientists hope NASA will repurpose one of the telescopes to study dark energy, the mysterious force that could explain the universe’s expansion.
