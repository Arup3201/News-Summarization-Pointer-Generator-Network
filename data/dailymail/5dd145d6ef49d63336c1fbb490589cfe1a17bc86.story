Police who arrested a suspected schoolgirl psychopath on suspicion that she cut off the head of a friend discovered that the alleged killer had been practising by cutting off animal's heads.

The 16-year-old schoolgirl had even told her father and stepmother that she planned to kill someone after getting bored of torturing animals, yet when her desperate parents tried to raise the alarm they were told there was no room for any more patients in the psychiatric hospital, and advised them to call back again in a week. 

The schoolgirl, not named for legal reasons, had also attacked her father with a baseball bat before allegedly attacking and severing the head of fellow student Aiwa Matsuo, 15, in the western Japanese city of Sasebo.

Victim: Police said Aiwa Matsuko was killed during a visit to the accused schoolgirl's apartment

After the attacks on animals - and on him - the suspect’s father had rented a small flat for his daughter where she lived alone and apparently carried on with her animal torturing tactics.

He had re-married about three months ago, after the girl's mother died of cancer last year, and is believed to have given cash to his daughter so that she could get by on her own after he failed to get her admitted to a psychiatric institution.

The rejection was made despite the fact that she had told her parents that she "wanted to dissect someone".

Suspect: A van carrying a schoolgirl - who was arrested on suspicion of killing a school friend at her home - leaves a police station for the prosecutor's office in Sasebo in Nagasaki prefecture

Crime scene: Police seal off the apartment building in Sasebo where the teenager was killed. The horrific crime came to light after Aiwa Matsuo's parents contacted police to say their daughter had not returned home

Details: A teacher at the school which both the victim and suspect attended tells assembled media about the staff's response to the grisly murder following an emergency meeting

Location: Both the victim and the suspect attended this school in the small town of Sasebo. The murder  comes just 10 years after Sasebo was rocked by a primary school girl being stabbed to death by a classmate

A day before the incident, her parents consulted with a psychiatrist and tried to get the girl hospitalised but the request was turned down due to lack of space at the facility.

The father then called a local child welfare office, but a security guard told him to telephone back after the weekend. But before he could do that, the murder had been carried out.

After the alarm had been raised, police who went to the high school girl's apartment in Sasebo, 900 miles south west of Tokyo, found the bedroom soaked in blood, with the decapitated body of her friend lying on the bed.

A police investigator told the AFP news agency that the accused admitted to strangling the victim before severing her head and left hand 'using tools... and something like a cord'.

Police alleged that the suspect struck Matsuo on the back of the head more than 10 times with a blunt instrument and while she was unconscious strangled her.

Then as a final act, it is alleged, the suspect cut off Matsuo's head and her left hand with a large knife.

The horrific crime came to light after Matsuo's parents contacted police to say their daughter had not returned home.

Police said Matsuo had earlier sent a message to her parents to say she was going to visit her friend at her apartment - then later sent her parents a text at around 7pm to say she was about to leave for home.

'She has not provided us with a motive for the attack at the moment,' said a police spokesman.
