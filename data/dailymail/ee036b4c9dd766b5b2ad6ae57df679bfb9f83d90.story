Drilling is expected to resume within days at a potential fracking site after police gained the upper-hand over a dwindling numbers of protesters.

Engineers were carrying out maintenance yesterday in preparation for exploratory drilling for shale gas on the outskirts of Balcombe, West Sussex.

Police made a series of targeted arrests around the camps after reviewing CCTV evidence of Monday’s violent protests. More than eight riot-trained policeman jumped out of a minibus before surrounding one female suspect and quickly driving her away for allegedly earlier assaulting an officer.

Altogether, three people were arrested yesterday, two for offences that happened during Monday’s protests and one for a public disorder offence while a lorry was entering the site.

Many of the activists had already decided to leave – with some saying they would focus on other sites that currently have applications for drilling being considered.

Hundreds of environmental campaigners had been buoyed by Sussex Police’s advice to energy company Cuadrilla last week that it could not secure the area from incursions.

As a result, the company decided to temporarily ‘scale down’ work to see how much potential energy was buried deep under the ground. This led to accusations the police had given into mob rule and were not enforcing the rule of law.

But after a day of action where the protesters were cleared away from the main gate, lorries and workers were yesterday escorted safely by police onto the site.

Following the arrest of 29 people – including Green MP Caroline Lucas – campaigner numbers have fallen to a third of the 1,200 present during the weekend. The ‘Reclaim the Power’ camp that was set up two miles away in a farmer’s field was also being dismantled yesterday and due to be completely cleared by tonight.

Sources say Cuadrilla executives now believe they can contain the site with the current police presence and private security patrolling the perimeter. Drilling, which was suspended last week, is provisionally planned to resume by the end of the week.

Sussex Police have been joined by more than 10 forces helping to provide a combined force of 400 officers to patrol the site around the clock.

Dave Packham, 37, who is unemployed and from London, was trying to hitch-hike back to the capital. He said: ‘I think it’s all over now. I came down last week but numbers have really dropped.

‘It was fun while it lasted and there was a great atmosphere. This has been like a music festival and people have really pulled together. I think the police are now not going to let us carry on so it’s time to move on.’

A statement on the ‘No Dash For Gas’ campaign website said its activists were considering more direct action techniques in Balcombe and other UK sites following the police clamp-down.

Cuadrilla had hoped to carry out exploratory drilling to assess if it is worth applying for a licence to extract shale gas that might involve fracking. The overall police operation against the protesters is expected to cost taxpayers more than £2million as it goes into its third week.

Fracking pumps liquid at high pressure deep underground to split shale rock and release gas to be used as fuel. Campaigners say this might pollute local water supplies and cause earthquakes.

Cuadrilla said in a statement: ‘Cuadrilla is rightly held accountable for complying with multiple planning and environmental permits and conditions, which we have met and will continue to meet.

‘Clearly we are held to one set of legally enforceable standards while some protesters believe that they can set out and follow their own.’

Under pressure, David Cameron broke his silence over whether he would support fracking in his Witney constituency, saying he would welcome it.

Last week, his spokesman declined ten times to give a definitive answer on the controversial practice.

But the same spokesman said on Monday: ‘If locally led planning processes were followed then yes, the Prime Minister would be happy [for fracking to go ahead].’ Mr Cameron has said the whole country should accept fracking as it might potentially cut rising energy bills.

Brighton MP Miss Lucas yesterday said she took direct action during a sit-in because ‘the Government isn’t listening’ to campaigner’s concerns.

Sussex Police said nine people who took part in protests on Monday had been charged with mainly public disorder offences, five cautioned and 14 bailed until a later date.

Last night, Sussex Police said fireworks and drugs had been seized from an area of woodland close to the Cuadrilla site where protesters have been accused of threatening a local landowner who asked them to leave.
