With computer games, television shows and mobile phones to distract them, it is no wonder that some children end up lying in the house all day.

But one who is bucking that trend is 10-year-old Will Doran, who has lived up to the Scout oath to always do his best by earning every single cub badge.

The adventurous young man, part of 3rd Sandhurst Troop in Berkshire, has earned all 33 activity badges, six challenge awards, six staged activity badges, three partnership awards, three core badges and the Chief Scout's Bronze and Silver awards.

Proud: Will Doran, 10, has collected all 51 Cub Scout badges as well as winning two awards for his work

In order to get them, Will had to practice martial arts, learn astronomy, master ice skating, hone his DIY skills, learn a foreign language and ride a horse - to name just a few activities.

However, when it came to sewing all 51 badges onto his uniform, he did need to turn to Mum for some help.

Will said 'I felt really excited to have achieved it and very proud of myself. It took determination and persistence. The hardest badges were horse riding and sailing.'

Enduring whatever the elements hurled at him, he toiled on scrub clearance at the local Wildmoor Heath nature reserve for his final Cub badge, Global Conservation, which was handed to him at a special presentation ceremony by assistant district commissioner Pam Pearce at the Scout hut in Sandhurst Memorial Park.

In order to get his badges Will had to learn a foreign language and practise martial arts, but according to him the sailing and horse riding were the hardest

From the age of six to eight, he achieved all 12 Beaver badges and by the time he was nine and a half, both the Chief Scout’s Bronze and Silver awards were sewn on to his jumper.

He’s won all 53 Cub Scout awards in just under two and a half years, which is the time youngsters can be Cub Scouts, from the age of eight to 10 and a half.

Brenda Davies, the group Scout leader - known as Akela - said 'I have been with the Scouts since 1998 and this is the first time I have ever seen this.

'When he got his Silver award in January last year, he said I am going to get all other badges and I didn’t really believe him.

'He stuck to his word and pestered us. He is a very lovely, enthusiastic adventurous little Cub who is a real credit to his parents and we are really proud of him.'

Now that he is nearly 11 Will has to move on to the Scouts and hopes to complete all the Duke of Edinburgh awards as a teenager

Will’s father Colin is group chairman of 3rd Sandhurst Scouts, his sister Olivia, 15, is a Ranger and 12-year-old brother Louis is a Scout.

All three siblings were representing Scouting and Guiding when the Duke of Edinburgh visited Sandhurst in April and Prince Philip admired Will’s collection of badges.

Now he’s nearly eleven, Will has joined the Scouts and he said 'When I am a teenager I am hopefully going to do all of the Duke of Edinburgh awards.'

Dad Colin, 51, said 'We are really proud of him. It shows the tenacity he has at everything he does.'

Andrew Thorp, Scout Association spokesman, said 'For a young person to have achieved all of their badges shows a diverse and adventurous programme is being provided locally.

'Scouting is more popular than it has been for a very long time with numbers growing across the UK.'
