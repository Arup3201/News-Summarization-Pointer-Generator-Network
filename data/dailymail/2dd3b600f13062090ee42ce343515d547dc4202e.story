Betrayed: Beverley Neville found out her husband of 13 years was living a double life

Beverley Neville used to be thankful for her chauffeur husband who worked all the hours he could to pay the mortgage on the house they shared in Welwyn Garden City, Hertfordshire, after she was made redundant.

Beverley, 58, believed that husband, Raymond, 55, often had to stay away from home as he worked night shifts and was regularly hired to drive to Cardiff.  

But she was shocked to discover her husband of 13 years was not the man she thought he was. In fact, many of the times he had stayed away 'working' he was actually seeing another woman.

And Beverley was stunned to find out he wasn't just having an affair - he had committed bigamy by marrying the other woman after forging divorce papers. 

Recalling the events that led to her shocking discovery on today's This Morning, Beverley said: 'One of the times he told me he was away in Wales I became worried because I couldn't get hold of him for ten days. His mobile kept going straight to answerphone.

'I had started working as a carer then and by coincidence, the son of one of the ladies I looked after worked at the same chauffeur company. I asked him to try and contact Raymond and he did - on a different number to the one I had.

'Raymond was living a double life and had two mobile phones and he wasn't in Wales, he was in China.' 

Beverley confronted her husband when he returned home but he denied everything. He said his work was 'top secret' so he couldn't tell her where he had been. 

'Oh so you're Pinocchio working for MI5 now?' she retorted at the time.

Suspicious of what he had been up to, Beverley later checked her husband's emails - which she had access to, as she did his invoicing for him.

This was how she discovered he was married to a Chinese nurse, April Chang, who he had set up home with less than 20 miles away in Harrow, North London. 

Beverley was stunned. She told presenters Eamonn Holmes and Ruth Langsford: 'I didn't know about his double life. I didn't have a clue as it was happening over a long period of time. If you married someone who is a chauffeur who does night work, how would you know any different?'

Beverley told Eamonn Holmes and Ruth Langsford on today's This Morning how she discovered her husband had married another woman by checking his emails after becoming suspicious of his behaviour

The betrayed wife revealed how things had started out so differently when she first met Raymond at a dance in 1997 and she had been instantly attracted to him.

She recalled: 'When I first met him, I danced with him and he asked for my number. We got on really well and had the same interests, we both enjoyed dancing and going out, we were hunky dory.'

Caught up in a whirlwind romance, Beverley said yes when Raymond proposed to her a year later.

It was only after they tied the knot that it became apparent Raymond was prone to withholding the truth. He'd failed to tell Beverley that he had been married before and was a father.

She said: 'I didn't know until after I married him that he had been married before and had children. He said if I found out he had children it might put me off.'

Beverley said they were happily married for a time until she was made redundant and Raymond volunteered to start doing extra shifts, which meant he would be away from home more.

Then in 2010, he came home and told Beverley about a money-making scheme he had heard about.

'One time he came home and told me about a friend who had a Chinese nurse for a girlfriend. She was struggling for a visa to stay in Britain and he couldn't ­marry her as his ­divorce hadn't come through,' she explained in an earlier interview in The Mirror.

'Raymond told me he was ­looking for someone else to marry her for a fee – just to keep her here.

'I thought it was really sad that someone was in that ­position, but even sadder ­anyone would be ­desperate enough for cash to marry someone they didn't love.

'I thought to myself: "we may be poor, but I love my husband, and that's worth a lot"'.'

But unbeknownst to Beverley, Raymond went on to marry Chinese nurse April himself in a £10,000 visa scam - and then he fell in love with her. 

They tied the knot at a registry office in Camden, North London, which Beverley only discovered two years later when she checked his email following his mysterious trip to China.

April appeared to have no idea Raymond was still married as he had forged divorce documents to make their union possible. 

Beverley reported his bigamy to the police in fear that she may be accused of being involved in the visa scam. 

In December last year, Raymond admitted perjury, bigamy and making forged statements and was sentenced to nine months, suspended for 18 months. 

On This Morning, Beverley said while Raymond admitted his crimes in court (while the 'Chinese lady was in floods of tears'), he has yet to confess his crimes to her.

'Still to this day he hasn't admitted to me what he did and he showed no remorse in court, he didn't offer a word,' she said.

She added that she's now trying to 'get on' with her life.

'I have to start again and keep myself busy and I have plenty of friends. I don't know if I would marry again.'
