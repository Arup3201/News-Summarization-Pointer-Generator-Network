South Carolina candidate for U.S. Senate and reality show star Thomas Ravenel broke up with his on-and-off screen younger girlfriend Kathryn Dennis and the couple did it on social media for all the world to see.

Southern Charm stars and parents of a baby girl Ravenel, 52, and Dennis, 23, suggested in Facebook and Twitter posts over the weekend that they were the one doing the breaking up.

The news comes right on the heels of revelations from the Charleston police who say they're investigating charges Ravenel assaulted Dennis's hairdresser Lauren Moser earlier this month.

Derailed again? U.S. senate hopeful Thomas Ravenel wanted to get his political career back on track after a 2007 cocaine conviction derailed it, but now he's being investigated for assaulting his Southern Charm co-star's hairdresser Lauren Moser. Here, Ravenel is pictured with daughter Kensington

According to Ravenel's Facebook announcement of the breakup, Dennis knows the truth about what happened between the Senate hopeful and Moser--information that could save his campaign--but she's too consumed by fame to help him out of the pickle.

'When the allegations surfaced that I had assaulted Kathryn Dennis' hairdresser, I pleaded with Kathryn to leave the Bravo shoot,' Ravenel, who hopes to unseat Republican Lindsey Graham.

Ravenel claims in his post that Dennis was all set to leave filming on Georgia's Jekyll Island. He says Dennis told him she was coming but backed out at the last minute--a disaster for his campaign.

'The temptation of missing film time was a more a important value to her. So telling. Our relationship is over,' he said.

Dennis, whose pregnancy news dramatically punctuated the first season of the Bravo reality series, hit back on Twitter around 1am Monday morning.

'I'm doing what's best for my daughter, and presently that is not being with Thomas,' Dennis tweeted.

Then, on Monday afternoon, the consummate politician halfheartedly apologized.

'While I was shocked and stunned at the situation I was in, no father should EVER speak negatively of the mother of his child. I was wrong,' Ravenel tweeted.

The drama has its roots in the alleged October 17 event now being investigated by Charleston police.

According to the assault allegation, reports the Charlotte Observer, Dennis and her hairstylist Moser were sitting outside a Charleston home when Ravenel showed up and began lecturing Dennis about the way she was caring for the baby.

HER SIDE: LAUREN MOSER'S POLICE REPORT

A complaint filed to Charleston, South Carolina police by Kathryn Dennis's hairdresser Lauren Moser paints Senate hopeful Ravenel as temperamental and abusive.

An excerpt of the complaint via the Charleston City Paper:

The victim stated that as she was walking behind the offender into the house he swung the door hard (as to close it) when he cleared [the] doorway and it bounced off of the victim's knee. The victim stated that when the offender saw that the door did not close he turned and swung the door again and this time the door struck the victim on the inside of the right arm due to the fact that her hand was raised because she was videoing the episode. The victim stated that the door hit her so hard it caused her to topple backwards down three steps and into some bushes. 

HIS SIDE: RAVENEL BEGS KATHRYN DENNIS TO HAVE HIS BACK 

Thomas Ravenel is beiong investigated following Moser's claims, which he denies completely. If true, these accusations would spell the end of Ravenel's already all-but-derailed political career.

He posted to Facebook along with news of their breakup that Dennis was scheduled to leave Southern Charm filming in Georgia return to South Carolina and defend Ravenel. Dennis, Ravenel writes, preferred to stay and film the show.

Ravenel has since taken the post down, but it's been preserved by the Charlotte Observer: 

When the allegations surfaced that I had assaulted Kathryn Dennis' hairdresser, I pleaded with Kathryn to leave the Bravo shoot in Jekyll Island. They had even packed her bags and had lined up a driver. She told me she was coming to clear my name but then she backed out at the last second and delayed telling the truth by 1 an 1/2 days. $900k of my campaign money down the drain. The investigators even told me that if she would have come and corroborated the accuser's story I would be cleared. The temptation of missing film time was a more a important value to her. So telling. Our relationship is over. 

Apology: Ravenel took down the Facebook post and the next day apologized via Twitter for the way he'd spoken about Dennis

Moser's complaint claims Ravenel then 'slipped and fell into the pool with the baby' before handing her off to Dennis.

Moser said she was following Ravenel into the house when he slammed the door on her knee and arm.

Ravenel denied the assault claims, but a read of his full Facebook post regaring his breakup with Dennis reveals the denial likely won't be enough to salvage what's left of his political career. 

This isn't Ravenel's first brush with political infamy. 

Ravenel was once South Carolina's Treasurer before being convicted on a cocaine charge and serving six months in prison.

Prior to his conviction, Ravenel was the working as Rudy Giuliani's campaign manager in the state.

Ravenel was also arrested on DWI charges in Montauk, New York in 2013.
