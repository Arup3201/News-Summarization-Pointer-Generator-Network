A Muslim accused of plotting to bomb locations in the U.S. has apparently been identified as the same man assaulting Christian protesters in a video posted online.

Sami Osmakac, 25, an immigrant from Kosovo, was said to have been planning an attack in Tampa, Florida using a  car bomb, machine guns and other explosives.

In the first video clip, a man who appears to be Osmakac, confronted Christian protesters and assaulted one outside the Tampa Bay Times Forum - leaving the man bleeding from the mouth. He was later arrested by police.

In the second video with the title 'Convert to Islam NOW! To all Atheist Christian (Non-Muslims)' a man who looks and sounds like Osmakac threatened members of other religions.

The message from Abdul Samia, believed to be one of Osmakac's aliases, warns viewers to convert to Islam 'before it is too late'.  The YouTube videos were posted in December 2010 and in April last year.

Sami Osmakac, a naturalized U.S. citizen, was charged yesterday with one count of attempted use of a weapon of mass destruction.

Osmakac, of Pinellas County, Florida, 
allegedly bought explosives and guns from an undercover FBI agent, which
had been made unusable.

He allegedly told the officer that he wanted to 'die the Islamic way' in attacks at locations in Ybor City and South Tampa.

After being tipped off in September, the five-month investigation culminated with a sting operation at the weekend.

Shortly before his arrest he made a 
video of himself explaining his motives for carrying out the planned 
attack, authorities said.

Threat: Sami Osmakac, 25 was said to have been planning an attack in Tampa, Florida using a car bomb

In
the eight-minute video he is seen cross-legged on the floor with a 
pistol in his hand and an AK-47 gun behind him.

He said in the video that Muslim blood 
was more valuable than that of people who do not believe in Islam, 
according to a criminal complaint.

Osmakac allegedly added that he wanted 'payback' for wrong that was done to Muslims and bring terror to his 'victims' hearts' in Tampa.

A
confidential source allegedly told federal officials in September 2011 that Osmakac wanted Al Qaeda flags.

Two
months later he talked with the source and ‘discussed and identified 
potential targets in Tampa’ that he wanted to attack, authorities said.

Osmakac allegedly wanted help getting the firearms and explosives for the attacks, and was put in touch with an undercover FBI employee.

Last month Osmakac met with the agent and allegedly told him that he wanted to buy weapons including an AK-47-style machine gun.

He also allegedly wanted Uzi submachine guns, high capacity magazines, grenades and explosive belt.

Osmakac gave the agent a $500 down payment for the items in a later meeting and outlined his intentions to build bombs, authorities said.

Osmakac allegedly said at another meeting earlier this month that he wanted to bomb
night clubs, a business and the Operations Center of the Hillsborough 
County Sheriff's Office. It is also believed he wanted to blow up an Irish pub and Starbucks coffee shop.
