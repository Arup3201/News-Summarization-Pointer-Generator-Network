A property developer has had his pride and joy towed after parking his white Lamborghini in a disabled space without a permit.

The $400,000 2011 Aventador was snapped at LynnMall in West Auckland, New Zealand, after passers-by stopped to admire the flash sports car.

A man took the photo that showed a distinct lack of any mobility permit on the dashboard and sent it to the New Zealand Herald. 

This white Lamborghini was towed from outside a shopping centre in New Zealand

The car’s owner Gerard Peters, who runs a property business and also imports high-end vehicles, told the paper he was sorry and had only left his car parked there for ‘a couple of minutes’.

Security at the LynnMall carpark contacted a towing company and had the car removed after a call out on the centre’s loudspeaker for 30 minutes.

NZ Towing gave Mr Peters a $300 fine after he did not collect the car until the next day.

Daily Mail Australia has contacted Mr Peters for comment.

The car's owner Gerard Peters told the New Zealand Herald he regrets the decision to park his car in the disabled spot

In Queensland an Australia Post truck was photographed parked in a disabled space 

No permit was disabled on the vehicle so it was posted on the No Permit, No Parking Facebook page 

Calling out drivers for wrongly parking in disabled spots is becoming somewhat of a trend, with Queensland resident Alicia Wright even setting up a Facebook page dedicated to the rule breakers.

Ms Wright, who has Parkinson’s disease, runs the Facebook page No Permit, No Parking where photos of cars parked in disabled spots are posted.

The page shows photos of Australia Post trucks, Mercedes 4x4’s and Audis all parked in disabled spots with parking permits.
