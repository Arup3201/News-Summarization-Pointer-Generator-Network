The Premier League is in full swing and fans across the country will have firm opinions on the best and worst performers so far this season.

Courtesy of the EA Sports Player Performance Index, Sportsmail can reveal exactly which players have performed the best during the first two months of the current campaign.

As expected, it is Chelsea - currently top of the Premier League with six wins from their opening seven fixtures - who hold the top three positions in the Player Performance Index rankings.

Chelsea's Diego Costa has settled into the Premier League very quickly and been on fire this season 

Top goalscorer Diego Costa, who has netted nine times already since his summer arrival from Atletico Madrid, tops the charts followed by team-mates Eden Hazard and Cesc Fabregas who has assisted his Spain colleague four times.

Raheem Sterling, who came off the bench in England's win over Estonia on Sunday, is fourth in the rankings with a PPI score of 172 followed by Swansea midfielder Gylfi Sigurdsson on 168 and Manchester City frontman Sergio Aguero on 166.

Southampton's Graziano Pelle, who arrived at St Mary's in the summer at a time when Morgan Schneiderlin wanted to leave the South Coast, sits seventh whilst his new French team-mate, who ended up staying with Ronald Koeman's side, is ninth. 

Young West Brom striker Saido Berahino, currently the highest English goalscorer, is eighth on the list following an impressive start.

Leicester attacker Leonardo Ulloa, who has scored against Man United, Arsenal and Everton already this season, completes the top 10.

Away from the highest ranking players, Mesut Ozil may have been criticised for some of his performances so far this season but the German international has actually been Arsenal's second best player behind fellow midfielder Aaron Ramsey.

Alexis Sanchez, the Gunners' £30million summer signing from Barcelona, has been their third-best player with the Chilean's stand-out moment being a stunning volley in September's 2-2 draw against Manchester City.

Wayne Rooney is ranked as Manchester United's second best player, but does not make the top 10

Yaya Toure is yet to hit top form for Manchester City this season but is still their third best player

Another player to arrive in England from La Liga, Angel di Maria, tops the Manchester United charts with a score of 132.

The Argentina midfielder became English football's most expensive player following his £60m switch to Old Trafford from Real Madrid and has scored three goals in five appearances for the Red Devils.

Wayne Rooney, named captain at the start of the season by new United boss Louis van Gaal, is second among United's 'Gaalacticos' with Robin van Persie third.

Jordan Henderson has been one of Liverpool's best players this season and scored against West Brom

Alexis Sanchez has been Arsenal's third best player so far this season according to the stats

Looking at the other half of Manchester, Yaya Toure, who is yet to hit top form this season, is Manchester City's third best player behind Spaniard David Silva who lies 13th overall in the Premier League standings.

Jordan Henderson and Steven Gerrard make up Liverpool's top three along with Sterling while Tottenham's best performers include Emmanuel Adebayor and Nacer Chadli - two players who struggled for spells last term. Christian Eriksen has been Spurs' standout man.

Everton frontman Steven Naismith, signed on a free transfer from Rangers in 2012, has outperformed the Toffees' £28million summer signing Romelu Lukaku.

The Scotland forward scored in every one of Everton's opening three games while Lukaku has struggled for form since arriving permanently at Goodison Park.
