Road death: PC Hassan Ali, 44, who was under investigation by the Independent Police Complaints Commission over the Rotherham scandal, has been killed after being knocked down by a car

A serving police officer linked to the Rotherham child sex scandal has died after being hit by a car as he crossed the street.

PC Hassan Ali, 44, was under investigation by the Independent Police Complaints Commission after it was alleged he twice asked a victim out on a date.

Four complaints in total were made against PC Ali to South Yorkshire Police by two members of the public.

But PC Ali was fatally injured  after being struck by a car in Darnall, Sheffield at around 10.15pm last Wednesday.

He died with his family at his bedside yesterday morning.

His death comes just two days after a bombshell report branded Rotherham Council ‘in denial’ over the abuse of up to 2,000 young girls over a 16-year period, predominantly by members of the town’s Pakistani community. 

Police, who have made no arrests, say they are not treating his death as suspicious and a source said they believe it was a 'tragic accident'.

Chief Constable David Crompton, of South Yorkshire Police, said: 'All of our thoughts are with Hassan's family and on behalf of the force I would like to offer my sincere condolences at this incredibly difficult time.

'PC Ali was a well-liked officer whose colleagues are devastated by what has happened.'

He was a neighbourhood policing officer based in Rotherham and had been placed on 'restricted duties', while the IPCC assessed whether to launch a full investigation into him.

He was one of ten officers from the force referred to the IPCC for their handling of the scandal. 

One of the complainants, who is now an adult, said PC Ali had first asked her out when she was 17 and then did so again four years later when she was 21.

The woman said the officer had been involved with her case and was aware she had been a victim of sustained abuse between the ages of 14 and 17.

At the time he first asked her on a date, she had a one-year-old son, who had been born after she was made pregnant by her abuser when she was 15.

The woman said the officer's behaviour had been 'inappropriate and totally unprofessional'.

Appeal: Police want to speak to witnesses to the collision that fatally injured the police officer in Staniforth Road, Sheffield. It is not being treated as suspicious

She said she told the police of his approaches in August 2013 when she gave a statement about the abuse she had suffered, but she claimed nothing was done to investigate her claims. 

South Yorkshire Police last month confirmed an officer had been referred to the IPCC. 

The woman said she had asked the officer when she was a teenager to provide her with a picture of her son's father for his nursery.

'He said I will get you a picture but you are not to tell anyone because I could lose my job,' she said.

'He said he had to go into files that he wasn't authorised to go into. Then he fetched me the picture to my mum and dad's house. He came in and my mum made him a drink.

'I walked out with him and he asked me out on a date. A few years after he asked me out again.'

She said she had said no on both occasions. 

The nature of the other complaints made against him are not known.

A police spokesman said: ‘South Yorkshire Police has received four public complaints relating to alleged misconduct of one of our officers.

‘The complaints were made by two separate people about the officer, a PC based in the Rotherham area.’

This afternoon an official Ukip Twitter account said the death of the was 'Karma'.

The tweet, which was deleted shortly after being posted this afternoon, read: 'South Yorkshire police says PC Hassan Ali who was under investigation in relation to child abuse in Rotherham has died in a car crash KARMA!'.

Ukip blamed volunteers running the page for the tweet.

A Ukip said: 'The UKIP Plymouth account is run by a team of volunteers, and it seems the tweet was made by one of them without permission.

'Once it was tweeted it was deleted almost immediately. The content of the tweet does not reflect the views of the branch, its candidates or indeed the wider party. The matter is being investigated.'
