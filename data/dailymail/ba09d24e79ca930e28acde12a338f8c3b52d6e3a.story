When former
Barcelona B, Roma and Celta Vigo coach Luis Enrique begins work as the new
coach at the Nou Camp this week he will begin the biggest overhaul of the team since his pal
Pep Guardiola took charge in 2008.

Established key names could leave Barcelona and they will need replacing.

Sportsmail looks at exactly who will be
‘incoming’ and ‘outgoing’ as the revolving door at the Nou Camp begins to spin.

New boy: Goalkeeper Marc-Andre ter Stegen will sign from Moenchengladbach this summer

IN Marc-Andre ter Stegen will be the first signing. The 22-year-old keeper signed from
Borussia Monchengladbach should arrive this week.

OUT Victor
Valdes will join Monaco. He leaves as Barcelona’s most decorated goalkeeper.

OUT Jose
Pinto will cease to be the reserve keeper. Messi’s great pal has shown in
the run-in that he no longer has what it takes to fill Barça goal in times of
emergency.

On their way: Goalkeepers Victor Valdes and Jose Pinto will leave the club this summer

IN A No 2 will be brought in. Valencia’s Diego Alves, Levante’s Keylor Navas,
Malaga’s Willy Caballero and Liverpool’s Pepe Reina are all candidates, although
the latter might end up at Atletico Madrid if, as expected, they lose Thibaut Courtois.

OUT Dani
Alves. Practically signed, sealed and delivered to Paris Saint-Germain, meaning it’s the end of an era
for arguably Barcelona’s greatest ever right back.

OUT Carles
Puyol. Retiring and simply irreplaceable.

On his way: Dani Alves is not expected to be at Barca next season

Calling it quits: Carles Puyol retired at the end of the season and will be a big loss

IN Trying
to replace the irreplaceable one will be a tough job. David Luiz has the hair
for it. He also has the chaotic, occasionally calamitous style that Puyol
showed earlier in his career.

IN Even if
Luiz signs, Barcelona will still look to further strengthen their weakest area.
Athletic Bilbao’s Aymeric Laporte and Real Sociedad’s Inigo Martinez will be
leading candidates.

OUT (of the
question) Vincent Kompany and Javi Martinez are also on Barca’s wishlist but
both look like staying right where they are (Manchester City and Bayern Munich respectively).

The Nou hairo: David Luiz has been a long term target for Barcelona and could step in for Puyol

OUT Alex Song was sold to Barcelona fans as someone who could play in
the centre of defence or in midfield. The former was plainly never true and he
has never been given the chance to demonstrate the latter. Will be sold if a
buyer can be found.

IN Barca
want another midfielder and some have put Paul Pogba on their wanted list. Hard
to think why Juventus would sell. Toni Kroos is another target but new Manchester United manager Louis van
Gaal might have other ideas.

One in, one out: Paul Pogba could come in at Barca and Alex Song could be heading for the exit

OUT
Fabregas, Pedro, Alexis Sanchez. None of them will leave for so much as a euro
less than Barcelona want, and it’s clear they won’t all leave. But for
Barca to bring in as many players as they want to it’s clear they will have to
sell big too and these three all have suitors with cash to spend. Alexis the
most likely of the three to eventually move on.

OUT Cristian Tello, Adriano, Martin Montoya, Ibrahim Afellay and Isaac Cuenca will
also be show the door to make way from returning loanees.

IN Gerard Deulofeu will return to play for his former Barca B team boss. Everton could
sign one of the above to fill the gap or take 18-year-old Adama Traore on loan.

On the move? Cesc Fabregas could be heading for the exit at Barca and could return to the Premier League

Return: Gerard Deulofeu looks set to head back to Spain after a loan spell at Everton

IN it used
to be that Plan A worked so well that there was no need for a Plan B but Barça
now see the need for a big centre forward who can offer solutions when all else
fails. Fernando Llorente has been discussed although, as with Pogba, why would
Juventus sell?

OUT Xavi
and Javier Mascherano. Such is the huge respect for these two players they will only
go if they decide to. Neither can be assured a first-team place in the new
Barcelona and so if Xavi is tempted by an MLS adventure and Mascherano fancies
a Serie A or Premier League swansong, they will be allowed to move on.

Happy faces: Lionel Messi signed his new contract with club president Josep Maria Bartomeu

And after
all that IN and OUT, there will also be some of the proverbial. Shake it all
about for Leo Messi.

After the announcement of a new £16.3m-a-season contract on Friday he could yet dash off to South America for World Cup
preparations without actually signing it, such is doom and gloom that now
surrounds the four-times Ballon d’Or winner.

Enrique’s first job
when he starts work on July 7 will be to get Barcelona’s talisman back in the
groove.
