A scuffle with a suspected shoplifter in a busy New York shopping mall sent Christmas shoppers running for the exits - because they thought he was a gunman.

The mass panic occurred on Christmas Eve when security guards at Macy's at the Roosevelt Field mall on Long Island wrestled with someone they believed was a thief.

Witnesses spoke of hearing several loud booming sounds that reverberated around the shopping center when the fight broke out.

Thinking it was gunfire, hundreds of people stampeded out of the mall, fearing for their lives.

Some were so frightened they were reduced to tears and outside people hugged each other for comfort.

In fact, the loud noises were caused by an display case being knocked over.

The mall closed temporarily amid the chaos, but Nassau County police officers on patrol in the mall quickly restoredÂ  calm.

One witness told CNN: 'With people running and screaming, your first thought is "just get out of here".'

Another said: 'Watching that many people move, at that pace, is very concerning. You don't know what it could be.'
