A First World War seamstress flirted with soldiers on the front line by sewing romantic poems into their kilt linings, it has emerged.

A note with a three-line poem, followed by an address, was found attached in an heirloom which had been passed down for generations without being discovered.

After some of the stitches were unpicked from the garment - which was meant to be sent to Scottish soldiers in the field but never made it - the note dropped out.

Hidden message: This London Scottish Regiment kilt had a flirty note sewed inside of it, from a seamstress who referred to herself as Helen Govan, and left her address

'If single drop a line': The message, which rhymes in parts, imagines the handsome soldier in his kilt and suggests he get in touch - as long as he isn't married

It imagines the soldier looking handsome in uniform and suggests that he gets in touch with the seamstress, identified as Helen Govan - unless he is already married.

The rhyming message said: 'I hope your kilt will fit you well, & in it you will look a swell.

'If married never mind. If single drop a line.

'Wish you bags of luck, & a speedy return back to Blighty.'

Economic historian Dr Helen Paul, of the University of Southampton, found the hand-written message when she was removing the packing stitches from the kilt, which has been passed down her family over decades. 

The London Scottish Regiment kilt, manufactured by Peter Wilson of Bridge Street in Glasgow, would have been made for use by a soldier sent to fight in the war, but for reasons unknown, it was never unpacked or worn.

Dr Paul is now hoping to find the descendants of the seamstress to uncover the story behind the note.

Heirloom: Dr Helen Paul, an academic at the University of Southampton, found the note in the kilt, where it had lain untouched for around a century

She said: 'This garment has been in our family for a number of decades, and until recently, we were completely unaware there was such an intriguing secret hidden in its folds. It was a real surprise when the note fell out.

'My father tried to trace any relatives of the note's author a few years ago, but his efforts failed and I'm hoping to pick up where he left off.

'There are many unanswered questions. We don't know how many of these poems this lady sent. 

'Was this a one off, or were there many more lost to the battlefield, or even still existing undiscovered?

'If there were more, did anyone ever answer her message and indeed did she ever meet and marry a soldier returning from the war?

'It would be fantastic to trace who this lady was and learn more about her history, as well as the social history of the women who made and packed the kilts, which ultimately went to clothe the soldiers fighting in the trenches.'

Clothing historian Professor Maria Hayward from the University of Southampton said: 'The condition of the kilt is very striking - you do not expect to see a piece that has such clear links to the First World War being in such good condition.

'The construction, which is very simple, in combination with the efficient use of fabric and the way one size could be made to fit most men, made kilts of this type a very versatile piece of military uniform, which also retained its distinctive national identity.'
