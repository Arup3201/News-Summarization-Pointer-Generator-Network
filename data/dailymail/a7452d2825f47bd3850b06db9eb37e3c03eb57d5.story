Of course the London-born singer is 
currently resting her voice due a vocal chord injury - which saw her 
have to cancel her American tour and which could prevent her performing 
at the actual Grammys ceremony in February next year.

Her album 21 will compete against Foo Fighters’ Wasting Light, Lady Gaga’s Born This Way, Mars’ Doo-Wops & Hooligans and 
Rihanna’s Loud for the album of the year honour.

West, meanwhile, mainly received

He also is up for song of the year for All of the Lights, for which he has a co-writer credit.

Best new artist nominees are folk band Bon Iver, country trio Band Perry, rappers J. Cole and Nicki Minaj and Los Angeles-based
