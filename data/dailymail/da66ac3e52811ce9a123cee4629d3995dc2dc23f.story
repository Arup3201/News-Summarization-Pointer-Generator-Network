Sergio Aguero has been pictured stocking up on festive supplies at his local supermarket - father-in-law Diego must be making a Christmas visit.

The Manchester City striker, who is married to Maradona's daughter Gianni, posted this picture of himself on Twitter filling his trolley in Waitrose along with the caption: 'Tarde de compras en el Super' (In English: This afternoon, going shopping).

Sportsmail understands that the Argentina legend, 52, who seemingly likes a good feed, will be paying his son-in-law a visit over over the Christmas period and is set to take in a City game.

Maradona watched Aguero and Co defeat bitter rivals Manchester United 1-0 at the Etihad Stadium in April this year. Captain Vincent Kompany scored the winner.

Ever the professional, Aguero, 24, who will line up at Wigan in a bumper night of eight Barclays Premier League fixtures, was snapped in the middle of the fruit and veg aisle - so City's nutritionist can rest easy.

It's not clear whether the striker was using Roberto Mancini's January shopping list, but here at Sportsmail we've come up with a Supermarket XI that may interest the Italian boss and his scouting network...
