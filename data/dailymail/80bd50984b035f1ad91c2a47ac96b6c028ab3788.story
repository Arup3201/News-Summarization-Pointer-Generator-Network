A man has been convicted of beating his wife to death and dumping her body off a remote logging road in the woods just hours after she filed divorce papers.

James Robarge, 45, from Saxtons River, Vermont is alleged to have flown into a rage and callously killed his wife who was found ten days later with her head and hands detached from her corpse.

During his murder trial, he testified  that he had not killed her, but a New Hampshire jury  convicted him of second-degree murder after deliberating for more than 12 hours over three days.

After the verdict was handed down, Robarge's two daughters left the courtroom sobbing and clutching one another in disbelief.

According to police, Kelly Robarge, 42, had filed for divorce after more than 20 years of marriage on June 27, 2013 — the day she disappeared from her Charlestown, New Hampshire, home. 

Her badly decomposed body was found ten days later in Unity.

Her husband could face life in prison for her murder when he is sentenced in April.

The jury rejected a first-degree murder charge but found him guilty of second-degree murder for reckless conduct that showed 'extreme indifference to the value of human life.'  

Defense attorney Caroline Smith said: 'We are pleased that the jury who met him as well could not believe he would ever plan to kill his wife.

'We're certainly saddened that they thought he killed her at all.'

However, prosecutor Diana Fenton told jurors last month: 'He dumped her out in the woods like a piece of trash and left her out there in the woods to rot.'

Prosecutors said the entryway to Kelly Robarge's home contained 'countless' spatters of blood.

And James Robarge's disabled car was found several miles from where her body was discovered with a bloodstained trunk and numerous bloody items outside it.

However, most of the case was built largely on circumstantial evidence.

The closest thing to an eyewitness was a Unity man who said he saw Robarge, wearing latex gloves, crouched beside his disabled car on a turnaround in Unity the night Kelly Robarge disappeared. 

Her body was found off a logging road not far from there, and forensics experts said metal fragments found near an oil-smeared rock on the road matched Robarge's shattered oil pan.

Due to the condition of her body, a medical examiner could not pinpoint the cause of death or determine how her head and hands became detached but concluded she died as the result of 'homicidal violence.'

Meanwhile, one of the last people to see Kelly Robarge alive the day she disappeared was Frances Uptegrove, a physician assistant who had treated her for anxiety and depression for several years. 

Uptegrove testified that Kelly Robarge told her she was heading to court to file for divorce.

He said: 'She seemed clear-headed, determined. She'd made up her mind.'

Public defender Alex Parsons told jurors during his opening statement on January 15 that James Robarge was 'the critical witness.'

In testimony spanning two days, James Robarge showed no emotion as he repeatedly denied threatening or harming his wife and stared straight ahead when the verdict was announced.

Robarge claimed that he didn't know his wife had filed for divorce, but he acknowledged that just days before, he found a letter from her on their kitchen counter saying she wanted one.
