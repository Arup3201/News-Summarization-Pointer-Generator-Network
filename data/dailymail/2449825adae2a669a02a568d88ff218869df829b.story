While TJ Oshie steals headlines for emerging from the ranks to lead Team USA hockey to victory over almighty Team Russia on Saturday, it's his gorgeous fiancee who's now stealing hearts.

Even at eight months pregnant, Lauren Cosgrove managed to remain the picture of blonde beauty as she cheered on the 27-year-old St. Louis Blues forward, but the intense game-winning shootoout nearly proved to be too much.

'I might go into labor,' joked Cosgrove, as she watched the breathtaking display from home in Missouri.

Shocking upset: USA forward T.J. Oshie, who normally plays for the St. Louis Blues, reacts after scoring the winning goal against Russia goaltender Sergei Bobrovski on Saturday. Back at home, eight months pregnant fiancee Cosgrove couldn't have been more thrilled

Cosgrove told KSDK that she's accustomed to her fiancee's prowess and that, despite all the excitement, it's no surprise he's rocketed to overnight superstardom.

'He's been a hearthrob for a while, here in St. Louis at least,' said the pert, smiling Cosgrove, who stayed behind because of her looming due date.

Nonetheless, Minnesota raised Oshie barely made it to the Olympics.

He was among the final selections for the U.S. roster and while he has never had a 20-goal NHL season, Oshie leads the Olympic team's American-born players with seven shootout goals this year.

Oshie scored four times in the shootout and put the winner between the Russian goalie's legs in the eighth round, leading the United States past Russia 3-2 in the thrilling revival of the classic Olympic hockey rivalry stretching back to the USA's 1980 Miracle on Ice win.

So, it may have been his small fish attitude less than his underdog status that made Oshie's game winning shoot out goal so unexpected.

Just ask Cosgrove what he said when he called her after the game.

'I hope this all blows over pretty quick,' Cosgrove recalls Oshie saying about the media frenzy currently encircling him.

'This isn't really him,' she said. 'He's so low key.'

'I might go into labor!': Cosgrove, who is due to give birth on St. Patrick's Day, was unable to make it to Sochi. She watched Saturday's headlining grabbing game from home with friends in Missouri

Cosgrove, who is due to give birth 
St. Patrick's day, says she's confident her country, and her personal 
hearthrob, will take Team USA to the top of the podium at Sochi.

'I definitely have faith in team USA and I think they have a shot at the the gold.'

Oshie's rise to fame was sparked thanks to a quirk in Olympic hockey rules.

Whereas
 in the NHL, teams must alternate which players they choose to face the 
goal keeper in a shootout, in the Olympics a coach may choose the same 
man each time.

Oshie 
was chosen for the U.S. men's hockey team with just such a situation in 
mind, and the shootout specialist concocted one last clever goal to 
silence an arena filled with screaming Russian fans.

International rules allow the same player to take multiple shots after the first three rounds of a shootout, and U.S. coach Dan Bylsma leaned on Oshie's array of slick shots and change-of-pace approaches to the net.

Oshie scored on the Americans' first shot before taking the last five in a row, going 4 for 6 against Bobrovsky and disappointing a Bolshoy Ice Dome crowd including Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Oshie's final shot was a beauty: He threaded a forehand right through Bobrovsky's pads, the puck punching the back of the Russian net emphatically enough to pop the water bottle on top into the air.

The U.S. men are only interested in the one that all but wrapped up an automatic berth in the quarterfinals next week.

'I think you're going to see T.J. Oshie become a household name after that display he put on,' said David Backes, Oshie's teammate in St. Louis. 'The kids will be out on the pond probably in Minnesota right now, throwing a 5-hole on the goalie three or four times in a row.'

Timothy Leif Oshie was born on December 23, 1986.

Grew up in Warroad, Minnesota AKA Hockeytown, USA, a town of 1,770 that's sent a player to every medal-winning USA men's hockey team.

Oshie was born in Everett, Washington, but as a boy moved to Warroad in hockey-crazed Minnesota. Oshie starred at Warroad High School, a tiny powerhouse in the northwest corner of the state, right near the Canadian border.

He led the Warriors to two state titles before playing three years in college at North Dakota.

Oshie was a first-round draft choice by the Blues in 2005. His entered the league in 2008, but his best season came in 2011-12 when he scored 19 goals and had 35 assists to help the Blues make the playoffs.

'I think you're going to see T.J. Oshie become a household name after that display he put on. The kids'll be out on the pond probably in Minnesota right now, throwing a 5-hole on the goalie three or four times in a row. He does a great job for us in St. Louis. That's part of the reason he's on this team, along with some of the other things you can't put on the stat sheet.' â€” Team USA teammate and St. Louis Blues forward David Backes.
