Children as young as five are being taught to massage each other at school in a new initiative designed to help them learn how to relax.

The global scheme, which has now spread to the UK, has been introduced in response to fears that pupils are suffering from elevated stress levels.

It involves instructors visiting schools and teaching children how to perform massages, before the youngsters are allowed to practice their skills on each other.

Massage: Children at Ardingly College in Sussex are being taught how to give each other massages

Programme: The initiative is supposed to reduce pupils' stress levels and help them relax

The Massage In Schools Programme was first launched 15 years ago Mia Elmsäter in Sweden and Sylvie Hétu in Canada.

As well as reducing stress, it is intended to help children concentrate at school and sleep better at night.

One of the British schools to have introduced the scheme is Ardingly College, a public school for boys and girls aged between two and 18 near Haywards Heath in Sussex.

Drama teacher Mary Spink, who is running the programme at the school, said: 'The children really enjoy it and are fully relaxed and calm afterwards.'

Friendly: The pupils must ask permission from each other before performing a massage

Teaching: Ardingly runs sessions every two weeks in which pupils take part in the 'Chill-out Club'

She said that parents had been supportive of the scheme - which sees pupils ask permission before they perform a massage on anyone else.

Eight-year-old pupil Dylan said he practises his massage techniques at home on his parents.

He said: 'As a class, it is peaceful, relaxing and calm and everyone is quiet, which we don't really get anywhere else.'

The massages are part of a school initiative called the 'Chill-Out Club', which teaches children to relax and to respect each other.

Hands: One pupil gives another a hand massage as part of the school's relaxation sessions

They are taught on a fortnightly basis to children aged between five and 13.

In the lessons, the children are encouraged to give each other feedback on their massage techniques, and taught 'mindfulness' as well.

Organisers of the scheme say that children who are taught how to perform massages often boost their self-esteem and are less likely to bully others.
