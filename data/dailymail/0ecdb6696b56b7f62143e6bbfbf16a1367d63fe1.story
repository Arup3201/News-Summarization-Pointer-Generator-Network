Police are looking for Juan Soria Hernandez after he allegedly poured petrol over his wife on Monday morning

Police are hunting a man accused of pouring gasoline over his wife before setting her on fire in front of their terrified children.

Juan Soria Hernandez, 31, allegedly poured the flammable liquid over his 29-year-old wife in the early hours of Monday morning.

Authorities were alerted to the horrific attack when his wife managed to call 911 just before 4am, telling emergency services her husband was trying to set her one fire. 

The Ventura County Sheriff's Office says police who attended her home in Broadway Road in Moorpark, Southern California, found her suffering from significant injuries.  

James Mireles, understood to be part of a power crew working nearby who the woman manged to flag down, said she had burns to her head, face, arms and upper body.

'She was telling us that there was a fire and that she needs help,' Mireles told KABC-7. 'As we got up closer to her, she was pretty badly burned.' 

Mireles said her three young children - who authorities have confirmed were at home - were terrified following the incident, which apparently took place in the bathroom. 

According to the Moorpark Acorn, somebody had already tried to put the fire out in the bathroom. 

Mireles added: 'I brought the hose around and started hosing down the kitchen, and that's when I saw a gas can in there. You could smell the gas.'

The woman was rushed to a local hospital, before being moved to a specialist burns unit.

Mireles said the children, all under seven, told him their parents had been arguing 'for hours'. 

Neighbour Alejandro Magdalena told KTLA 5 News: 'It's just king of shocking, hearing that.

'Honestly — hearing that someone poured gas onto his woman. That's just wrong.'

Police have not released the name of the woman, but have offered $1,000 for Hernadez's arrest.

It is thought Hernandez left the scene in his white Ford F250 truck with the licence plate 86644S1 (pictured)

The sheriff's office confirmed he was a suspect in an attempted murder. 

Hernandez, who is believed to be armed, is thought to be driving a white Ford F250 truck with the license plate 86644S1.

He is described as Hispanic, 5ft 7ins and about 200lbs.

People who see Hernandez or his truck are urged to call  911, while anyone with information can contact Detective Peterson at (805) 384-4744.
