A female vandal has daubed one of France's most iconic paintings with graffiti referring to the 9/11 terrorist attacks at the new Louvre museum in the northern city of Lens.

The 28-year-old woman used a red permanent marker pen to scrawl 'AE911' in three-inch high letters on Eugene Delacroix’s 1830 masterpiece Liberty Leading the People - which dramatically depicts a bare-breasted woman raising the French flag against oppression.

AE911 is the name of a website calling for an independent inquiry into the September 11, 2001 attacks on the Pentagon and New York’s World Trade Centre.

The woman was immediately grabbed by security guards after she wrote on the painting on Thursday evening, and remained in custody on Friday.

A specialist restorer was rushed to the scene and the Louvre believes that the inscription can be removed.

Liberty Leading the People is one of France’s best-known images that represents popular resistance to tyranny.

It had been loaned to the Louvre in Lens by the Paris Louvre to help launch the museum’s regional offshoot.

Theories: The truth behind the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks on the Twin Towers in New York and the Pentagon in Washington have been disputed by conspiracy theorists

It is not clear exactly what the 
woman's reasons were for attacking the artwork in the Lens Louvre but 
the graffiti she daubed on the piece suggests she was making a political
point about the 9/11 terrorist attacks.

There
are dozens of conspiracy theories claiming to explain the 'truth' 
behind the attacks floating around cyberspace, some of which are more 
believable than others.

Proponents
of these theories claim there are inconsistencies in the official 
government conclusions, or evidence which was allegedly 'overlooked.'

A
2008 global poll of 16,063 people in 17 countries, 15% of those who 
responded said they believed the US government was responsible while 
seven per cent even claimed Israel was the culprit.

One
of the most prominent conspiracy theories among self-proclaimed 
'truthers' is that the Twin Towers and number 7 World Trade Center were 
destroyed in a controlled demolition rather than as a result of the 
impact of the two aircraft and resultant fire.

Others apparently believe the Pentagon was hit by a missile launched by elements from inside the US. government.

Some
also claim the authorities had pryer warning of the terrorist attacks 
but deliberately failed to act on them, or even assisted the attackers.

Critics claim the theories are simply a common, and misguided, response among sections of society to a traumatic global event.

In 2009, a Russian woman tourist was arrested after hurling a mug at the world’s most famous painting the Mona Lisa, at Louvre in Paris.

The mug which she had just bought in the gift shop bounced off the bullet-proof glass shielding the Mona Lisa and shattered on the floor, causing no damage.

In 2007, another woman was prosecuted for kissing a 1.5 million pounds painting by American artist Cy Twombly and leaving a lipstick smudge on the canvas.

She claimed in court that her act was an ‘artistic gesture’, telling the court: 'I just gave it a kiss. It was an act of love, I wasn’t thinking. I thought the artist would understand.'

And in 2006, pensioner Pierre Pinocelli smashed a porcelain urinal - a modern ‘artwork’ by Marcel Duchamp - with a hammer.

He told a court in Paris: 'I am not the cheap vandal that some would have me to be. I wanted to pay homage to the spirit of Dadaism, which is all about disrespect.'
