The young man who killed Thomas Kelly in a brutal one punch attack in 2012 has reportedly stomped on another prisoner's head.

Kieran Loveridge, 21, and a 22-year-old inmate allegedly assaulted a 31-year-old inmate in a cell at the Mid North Coast Correctional Centre in Kempsey, NSW, on March 10.  

The 2GB Morning Show reported Loveridge trampled on the other inmate's head. 

Police told Daily Mail Australia the injured prisoner was rushed to Kempsey Hospital with head injuries.

Thomas Kelly (pictured) was killed in a single punch when Kieran Loveridge assaulted him on the streets of Sydney's Kings Cross on July 7, 2012. The attack was unprovoked and Kelly died two days later

A Corrective Services spokesman said both of the alleged attackers had been segregated and 'will be moved to other centres'. 

The alleged attackers are already facing tougher security restrictions.  

Loveridge was 18 on July 7, 2012, when he felled Thomas Kelly, also 18, with a single blow while he was out with his new girlfriend in Sydney's Kings Cross nightclub district.

Mr Kelly was rushed to St Vincent's Hospital but died two days later following emergency surgery.  

The attack triggered a huge uproar about alcohol-fuelled violence across Australia.  

It led Thomas's parents, Ralph and Kathy Kelly, to launch the Thomas Kelly Foundation - an organisation committed to fostering a more responsible drinking culture. 

Loveridge was initially sentenced to 5 years and 2 months in prison. His sentence was nearly doubled in July 2014 following a community backlash. 

Detectives are investigating the latest alleged attack. 

The assaulted inmate may not be co-operating with investigators, a police spokeswoman told Daily Mail Australia. 

'Police are continuing to pursue a number of lines of inquiry; however, it’s believed the injured inmate and witnesses are refusing to cooperate with investigators.'
