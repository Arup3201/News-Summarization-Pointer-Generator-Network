A policewoman who stole crash victims’ details and sold them to injury lawyers in a scam worth up to £1million was branded a ‘disgrace to the uniform’ yesterday.

Sugra Hanif, 27, was jailed for three and a half years for tarnishing the reputation of the force after downloading personal details from 2,456 road accidents recorded on a police computer.

The constable conspired with her married lover Raza Khan, 27, to sell victims’ names and numbers to ‘ambulance-chasing lawyers’ for fees of up to £800 a time. She has now been sacked.

Corrupt: Married father-of-two Reza Khan arrives at court for his sentencing yesterday where he was jailed for three years for a scam with WPC Sugra Hanif who illegally accessed the Police National Computer to find details of road traffic accidents, which the pair then sold to unscrupulous lawyers

Yesterday, His Honour Judge Andrew Barnett said that the ‘appalling’ actions of the corrupt officer had undermined public confidence in the police force.

‘You are a disgrace to the uniform you once wore,’ he told her. ‘You have let down the police and you have let down your colleagues because the reputation of Thames Valley Police has been tarnished. That is something that those who still serve have to live with.’

He added: ‘You have behaved in an appalling fashion, breaching time and time again the trust placed in you by the public and those who employ you.’

Winchester Crown Court heard that Hanif, from Banbury, Oxfordshire, trawled through the police national computer downloading almost 2,500 files on those involved in accidents.

She then telephoned 644 victims using the fake name Sarah Gold and said that she was from SR Auto Repairs – a company set up by Khan – to pressurise them to seek compensation for their injuries.

Policewoman Sugra Hanif is seen arriving at court with her solicitor at a previous hearing. Yesterday she was sent to prison for three and half years for stealing and selling accident victim's details from a police computer. Her cohort and married lover Reza Khan was sent down for three years

The lovers, who had an eight-month affair after meeting when Khan was in prison, set up two other businesses in 2011 selling reference numbers for each incident to solicitors, who paid fees of between £600 and £800 for a lead resulting in a claim. Hanif and Khan netted at least £26,400, but the scheme could have raked in more than £1million if all the details had led to claims.

They were arrested after an anonymous tip-off. Prosecutor Peter Asteris said Thames Valley Police could face a fine of £500,000 from the Information Commissioner’s Office, as well as claims from almost 5,000 victims.

The court heard Hanif joined the force in 2008 and was the only Muslim officer in Oxford. She alleged father-of-two Khan, who has previous convictions including death by dangerous driving and wounding, threatened to tell her devout family about the affair, but the jury rejected her account.

Khan was jailed for three years.
