The row between Sporting Lisbon and Doyen Sports over who gets what out of Marcos Rojo's proposed transfer to Manchester United is poised to end up in court unless a quick resolution can be found.

Doyen own 75 per cent of Rojo's rights and Sporting are contractually bound to pay the fund 75 per cent of any rejected bid. Sporting also say 20 per cent of any fee received over £4million for Rojo is also due to go to his previous club Spartak Moscow. Clear?

United have so far tabled an offer worth a reported £16million, which falls short of his £30million release clause, meaning Sporting will have to pay £12million if they continue to reject United's offer - and their 75 per cent.

Doyen confirmed that they will vigorously pursue that figure, whilst also threatening the Portuguese outfit with legal action if no payment is made. Sporting have now cancelled their contract with Doyen citing 'just cause'.

In a statement Doyen said: '(Sporting are) making mindless demands as a condition of releasing the player.

'If Sporting want to keep Rojo they must compensate the fund under the terms and deadlines set forth by the contract. If necessary we will not hesitate to use every legal resource at our disposal to fully defend our rights and interests.'

Rojo has become a key figure for United as Louis van Gaal wants a left-sided centre-back who can bring the ball out of defence unlike Jonny Evans, Phil Jones and Chris Smalling.

United are not confident at this stage in their ability to prise Angel di Maria from Real Madrid. They are the player's best option should he leave but it is understood Carlo Ancelotti would prefer other members of their foreign contingent to be sacrificed. Madrid need one non-EU player to go so they can recruit Radamel Falcao from Monaco.

Any United move for Arturo Vidal of Juventus remains on the sidelines also at the moment.

Juventus have made an enquiry for Benfica centre-back Luisao that could pave the way for Arsenal to sign Kostas Manolas from Olympiacos for £8million.

Towering Brazilian Luisao is eager to get a move done to Turin before Juve sign somebody else with Manolas high on their options.

Strategic advisor at Olympiacos, Christian Karembeu, admits Juventus have made an offer for 23-year-old Manolas, but so too have English clubs.

Karembeu said: 'The Bianconeri are interested in the player and have made a good offer. They are not the only ones, though… In the last few days interesting proposals have also arrived from England.

'The price, pretty much, is this - we are not willing to negotiate for less than €10m. We have not set a deadline. If we receive the right offer, we will sell him. Otherwise, we will keep him.'

The former Middlesbrough midfielder was asked if he was surprised by the attention now on Manolas: 'No. We were certain that he would become a player in the international market, even more so after the great World Cup with Greece.

'His preferred destination? Juve are top of his wishes, but Kostas has an emotional attachment to Olympiacos. He has a deal with the President, he will accept the team that will meet the economic needs of the club. Be that Juve or an English club.

'I think he would be fine with Juventus’ defenders. Kostas can be used indifferently in a back three or four. He is so fast he could play at the back by himself!'

Hull City and Crystal Palace have expressed interest in free agent Nicklas Bendtner but face competition from Bundesliga side Wolfsburg. The 26-year-old Dane has an offer from Olympiacos also but the prospect of playing in the Premier League again or the Bundesliga is more appealing.

Cardiff City's search for defensive re-inforcements has led them to Reading's Sean Morrison. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has asked for Michael Keane on loan from Manchester United, as have Blackburn, but Solskjaer has also enquired about Watford's defender Joel Ekstrand prior to bidding for Reading's Morrison. He will have a medical at Cardiff on Thursday as will Norwich winger Anthony Pilkington.

Norwich, meanwhile, have expressed an interest in Chris Wood of Leicester City after his proposed move to Wolves fell through. Peterborough are keen on Wolves striker Liam McAlinden. 

Charlton are in talks with Championship side Charlton are hoping to sign Alain Traore from Lorient on a season-long loan.

Deportivo La Coruna are hoping to pull off a double loan signing from the Premier League after holding further talks with Manchester City for midfielder Bruno Zuculini and with Fulham for Kostas Mitroglou. Zuculini has plenty of interest and City were keen to loan him out in the Premier League with Sunderland an option but Deportivo are hopeful they have persuaded Manuel Pellegrini to send him their way instead.

Mitroglou has been talking to former club Olympiacos but Deportivo are willing to pay the £2.5million loan fee that Fulham are chasing. Mitroglou has started only one match for Fulham since arriving in January for £10million and was not in the squad for their opening day Championship defeat to Ipswich Town last weekend.

City are in discussions over deals to either sell or loan John Guidetti and Scott Sinclair while they hope to formally announce Sergio Aguero signing his new contract very soon.

Aston Villa defender Joe Bennett is attracting interest from other Premier League and Championship clubs following the arrival of Aly Cissokho and Kieran Richardson. Bennett, 24, a £2.75million signing from Middlesbrough in 2012. 

QPR had made tentative enquiries as have Brighton but both have since moved on to other targets. Brighton are returning for Stephen Ward who was on loan from Wolves last season.

West Bromwich Albion are poised to bid £7.25million for West Ham winger Matt Jarvis. The 28-year-old has failed to rediscover the form that earned him an England call-up while at Wolves and the Upton Park club will sell. 

Albion have gone cool on Jonathan Biabiany from Parma with the Italian club looking for £8million. Jarvis at least would be aware of what is required in the Premier League, which would be an advantage over Biabiany in terms of transition.

Vic Alderweireld, the father and agent of Atletico Madrid centre-back Toby Alderweireld, has urged the club to send the Belgian international out on loan so the he can play more.

Premier League clubs have interest in the left-sided defender and in and interview with Het Nieuwsblad, the elder Alderweireld stressed: 'Toby wants to play, going out on loan would be the best option. If there is a solution, Atletico won’t stand in his way.

'Since last year, we’ve had several discussions on this issue and Atletico understands that we don’t think it makes sense to leave Toby on the bench for another year.'

Alderweireld is behind Diego Godin and Miranda.
