After conquering search, launching best-selling software, phones and tablets and even financing lab-grown burgers, internet giant Google is now turning its attention towards the quest for eternal life.

Founder and Google CEO Larry Page has announced he is teaming up with Apple's chairman Arthur Levinson for a health and well-being project called Calico.

Calico will focus on tackling the 'challenge of ageing and associated diseases' and will use expertise from Levinson's biotechnology firm Genentech to look for potential cures for age-related illnesses.

Google's co-founder Larry Page, pictured, has announced plans to finance a health startup called Calico. The new California-based firm will tackle the 'challenge of ageing and associated diseases' and will be run by Apple chairman Arthur Levinson. Levinson is also the chairman of biotechnology company Genentech

Announcing the new investment, Page said: 'Illness and aging affect all our families.With some longer term, moonshot thinking around healthcare and biotechnology, I believe we can improve millions of lives.'

Page added it was still too early to share other details about his hopes for Calico.

In May, Page 
announced he had a rare nerve disease that affects his vocal chords as well as a thyroid inflammatory  condition called Hashimoto's thyroiditis.

'While this is clearly a longer-term bet, we believe we can make good progress within reasonable timescales with the right goals and the right people,' Google chief executive Page said in an blog post on Wednesday.

Google isn't disclosing how much 
money it will give to Calico, but Page indicated it won't be a major commitment.

Larry Page - Google CEO and co-founder

Lawrence 'Larry' Page founded search engine Google with Stanford university friend Sergey Brin in 1996.

In April 2011 Page took over from Eric Schmidt as the chief executive officer of Google.

Page invented PageRank, the basis of Google's search ranking algorithm.

In May, Page 
announced he had a rare nerve disease that affects his vocal chords.

He also suffers from a thyroid inflammatory  condition called Hashimoto's 
thyroiditis.

Arthur Levinson - Apple and Genentech chairman

Arthur Levinson has been the chairman of biotechnology firm Genentech since 2009 and took the Apple chair in 2011.

He was formerly on the Google board until 2009 when the U.S. Federal Trade Commission 
opened an investigation into whether his role on Apple board
caused a conflict of interest.

Levinson is also a member of Genentech’s Scientific Research Board - a research advisory group.

The
 comments are an apparent effort to placate investors who would prefer 
to see the company boost its profits even higher instead of pursue 
far-flung ventures that may never pay off.

'Please
 remember that new investments like this are very small by comparison to
 our core business,' Page wrote in a post on his Google+ profile.

Google's stock gained $17.21 (£10.61), or nearly 2 per cent, to close Wednesday at $903.32 (£560).

Levinson
 was previously a member of the Google board but the U.S. Federal Trade 
Commission opened an investigation into whether his role on 
Apple's board caused conflicts of interest.

Calico will use expertise from Levinson's time at biotechnology firm Genentech in San Francisco. Levinson is also a member of Genentech's Scientific Research Board - a medical advisory group

Google previously ventured into the healthcare field in 2008 with the launch of its Google Health project.

Google Health was a 'personal health information centralisation service' also known as personal health record services in the U.S.

The service let Google users store their health records and details securely online.

Information could include 'health conditions, medications, allergies, and lab results.

However, after a lack of public interest, the firm was closed three years later following Page's appointment to CEO in April 2011.

Elsewhere, Google and its venture capital arm have invested at least $10 million in 23andme - a genetic testing startup founded by Brin's wife, Anne Wojcicki.

In an interview with Time magazine Page suggested it could be take 10 to 20 years before Calico's efforts bear fruit.

But he also said Calico's mission could prove to be even more important than curing cancer.

'One of the things I thought was amazing is that if you solve cancer, you'd add about three years to people's average life expectancy,' Page told Time.

'We think of solving cancer as this huge thing that'll totally change the world. But when you really take a step back and look at it, yeah, there are many, many tragic cases of cancer, and it's very, very sad, but in the aggregate, it's not as big an advance as you might think.'
