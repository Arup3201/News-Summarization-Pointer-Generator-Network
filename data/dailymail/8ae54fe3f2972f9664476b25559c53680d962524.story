Two Turkish university students who filmed a porn movie for their dissertation say they underwent a 'four-year nightmare' after being arrested for their course work.

Photographer Deniz Özgün, 26, and Elif Safak Urucu, 25, were dragged off  and interrogated after education officials reported their dissertation work to police in 2011.

Despite having had their idea approved by academics at Bilgi University, Istanbul, the dissertation was instantly marked as a fail upon completion, and the pair were arrested a few days later.

Mr Özgün and Ms Urucu said they had been treated like criminals and subjected to a four-year nightmare of court cases before finally being acquitted this month.

'I discussed everything with my academic leaders before going ahead, I told them quite clearly that we wanted to make a pornographic film in order to show how synthetic the sexual scenes in it were,' Mr Özgün, now a professional photographer and designer, told an Istanbul court.

Their arrests also resulted in the sacking of three academics from Bilgi University, one of Turkey's most prestigious private universities.

The university, also considered the most liberal in the country,  shut its film department after the 'porn dissertation' incident. 

The incident has drawn attention to the clash between traditional values and the sometimes experimental arts and lifestyles practised in Istanbul.

Bad result: Not only did the pair get arrested, Ms Urucu and Mr Özgün were failed on their dissertation

Mr Özgün and Ms Urucu said they had been forced to go into hiding after the university was flooded with hate mail.

The two explained in court how they had undergone a nightmare over the last four years and added that in addition the ordeal was unlikely to end.

A lawyer for the pair, Volga Gokce, said: 'This case should never have been initiated. It was clearly an academic project sanctioned and approved by university officials and neither of these young people should be held accountable.

'They have been put under enormous psychological pressure and at the end have been left with nothing. 

'Their university educations ended abruptly and there are little prospects for either of them here in Turkey.'
