Crackdown: Researchers found some supermarkets are selling alcohol so cheaply that it costs less than mineral water

Supermarkets are selling alcohol so cheaply that cans of lager and cider cost less than mineral water.

New research shows the price cuts – introduced in time for the World Cup – mean consumers can drink more than their daily recommended alcohol limit for less than £1.

It prompted experts to demand a ban on alcohol prices at 'dangerously low levels' because it was fuelling health problems, crime and antisocial behaviour.

The findings are also a blow for David
 Cameron who two years' ago announced a crackdown on bargain-basket 
alcohol prices by saying: 'When beer is cheaper than water, it's just 
too easy for people to get drunk on cheap alcohol at home before they 
even set foot in the pub.'

But
 the Prime Minister was forced to water down a new minimum price for 
alcohol of 45p a unit in the face of a revolt by most of the Cabinet who
 warned it would punish responsible drinkers on low incomes.

Instead, the Government outlawed 'very cheap' alcohol – despite admitting it would have little impact on problem drinking.

An investigation by Channel 4's Dispatches found three supermarket chains selling lager cheaper than sparkling Perrier water.

Tesco
 sold multipacks of Fosters, Carlsberg and Carling lager at 69p a pint 
and Strongbow cider for 65p a pint. This compared with Perrier mineral 
water costing 73p a pint.

In Asda, the same beers could be bought for 72p a pint, compared with 76p a pint for Perrier.

And at Sainsbury's, 20 cans of Fosters lager was 72p a pint while 15 cans of Strongbow cost £8, equating to 69p a pint, 7p less than a pint of sparkling water.

Researchers also found that Tesco and Asda have also been selling two-litre bottles of own-brand cider for £2.25 which means a man could drink his recommended daily alcohol limit for £1 and a woman for 75p.

Katherine Brown, director at the Institute of Alcohol Studies, said: 'The government has completely reneged on its commitment to tackle pocket money-priced alcohol, which is fuelling rates of disease and disorder in the UK.'

Public health and crime prevention experts wrote an open letter yesterday SUN calling on the Government to take 'urgent action to curb the damage caused by cheap drink'.

The 21 specialists criticised ministers for failing to 'tackle the burden that cheap alcohol places on society'.

Asda, along with Tesco and Sainsbury's, were found to be selling alcohol at less than the price of a bottle of Perrier

Recent government figures showed alcohol abuse is costing the country more than £21billion a year through crime, accidents and disease.

The experts, including Professor Ian Gilmore, the special advisor on alcohol to the Royal College of Physicians, warned England 'risked being left behind to deal with a growing burden of disease and social disorder' as Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland push ahead with plans for minimum unit pricing for alcohol.

The Prime Minister had proposed to ban the sale of alcohol at less than 45p a unit in England and Wales.

It would have meant a can of strong lager could not be sold for less than £1.56, a bottle of wine for less than £4.22 and spirits for £12.60.

But the plan was dumped last summer after strong opposition from within the Cabinet and a lobbying campaign by the drinks industry.

Ministers insisted it would be disastrous to penalise hardworking families who drank responsibly.

Instead, the Home Office announced in February it would ban 'very cheap' booze – effectively the first ever minimum pricing regime.

But campaigners dismissed it as 'laughable' when it emerged that supermarkets would still be allowed to sell cans of strong lager for as little as 50p, wine for £2.24 and 750ml spirits for just £10.16.

The new system works by banning shops and pubs from selling alcohol at less than the total cost of the duty payable to the Treasury, plus VAT.

The British Retail Consortium, which represents supermarkets, said: 'The efforts of retailers working with the government to give clear health information [and] reinforce health messages . . . are having an effect and we are committed to building on these.'

Crime Prevention Minister Norman Baker said: 'There has been no government U-turn on minimum unit pricing. It is still on the radar, but it is sensible to await the legal ruling in Scotland before advancing it further in England.

'Our ban on the sale of alcohol below the cost of duty plus VAT is the first ever government intervention to set a floor for alcohol prices and its significance should not be underestimated. It is after all a minimum price of sorts. It will stop the worst examples of very cheap and harmful drink.'
