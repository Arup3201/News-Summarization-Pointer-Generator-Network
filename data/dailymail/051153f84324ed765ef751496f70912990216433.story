George Soros says both Greece and Portugal should dump the euro and quit the EU because of their massive debts

Greece and Portugal should quit the euro to help save the currency, George Soros said yesterday.

The former currency speculator turned 
billionaire philanthropist also backed the idea of a euro bond, where 
debt is issued jointly by member states.

He said: ‘Countries sharing the currency must be able to refinance a large part of their debt under the same conditions.’

Such a bond would allow Europe’s 
poorer countries to raise money cheaply, because French and German 
financial muscle would act as a guarantee.

Soros told Germany's Der Spiegel magazine that Portugal and Greece leaving would not kill off the euro - or the EU.

Debt-stricken Greece and Portugal are struggling to implement eurozone and International Monetary Fund-mandated reforms by slashing spending and raising taxes in exchange for financial aid.

European shares experienced slight gains as investors focused on tomorrow’s meeting between France and Germany to deal with the current financial crisis in the region.

President Nicholas Sarkozy and Chancellor Angela Merkel have taken leading roles in the debt crisis and will hold talks and a press conference in Paris.

Soros also suggested the time had come for eurozone members to accept the introduction of eurobonds.

'Whether you like it or not, the euro exists. And for it to function properly, countries sharing the currency must be able to refinance a large part of their debt under the same conditions,' he said.

Berlin is opposed to the introduction of such bonds, but Soros suggested Germany, as Europe's strongest financial partner, should be responsible for defining the rules for its introduction.

Soros, who made over $1billion by betting against the British pound in 1992, also said he had no intention of playing the market against the common european currency.

'I am certainly not betting against the euro, because the Chinese have a huge interest in an alternative to the dollar and will do everything possible to help Europeans save it,' he said.

Chancellor Angela Merkel and President Nicholas Sarkozy (pictured here in December last year) have taken leading roles in the debt crisis and will hold talks and a press conference in Paris.

Both Greece and Portugal, along with Ireland, have been granted multi-billion EU-IMF rescue loans to prevent them from defaulting on their huge debts.

Despite Berlin’s resistance to the idea of eurobonds, today one of Germany’s leading economic associations came out in favour of the move, claiming all other avenues had been exhausted.

BGA export association president Anton Boerner said: ‘What is the alternative?

'The alternative is the markets attack Italy, then France, we lose our AAA rating and then it's our turn. This is a downward spiral that would lead to a worldwide depression.              

'What have we achieved then? We'll end up paying [for the crisis] three times over. This way we pay just once.'        

The head of the centre-left Social Democrats, Sigmar Gabriel, has also backed the idea, telling German public television station ARD late on Sunday that eurozone countries should be able to raise 50-60 per cent of their funding through such joint issues if they agreed to certain conditions.

'States that use eurobonds would have to agree to give up a degree of sovereignty over their own budgets,' Gabriel said.              

After unveiling tougher austerity plans in return for European Central Bank help, Italian Economy Minister Giulio Tremonti said a common eurozone bond would stop markets forcing high-debt economies in the bloc to the brink.          

'We would not have arrived where we are if we had had the eurobond,' he said on Saturday.

Merkel and Sarkozy are instead expected to discuss improving economic governance in the eurozone.

Officials have suggested they could agree to introduce regular meetings of eurozone leaders - a longstanding French demand - and enlarge the role of European Council President Herman van Rompuy to make him a spokesman for the euro.   

These steps could bring greater policy discipline in the 17-nation currency bloc, which has regularly sowed confusion in the markets by talking with disparate voices, but are unlikely to assuage market concerns about the high debt and deficit levels of certain countries in the bloc.

Yields on Italian and Spanish bonds fell back to around five percent last week after the ECB intervened in the market to support them. The ECB is due to publish data detailing how many bonds it bought in the week up to last Wednesday.

Both German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble and Economy Minister Philipp Roesler gave interviews over the weekend in which they spoke out against eurozone bonds and debt collectivization.   

Conservative German newspaper Die Welt, however, reported that the government was no longer ruling out the idea.              

Merkel, whose popularity has sunk to its lowest level in nearly five years according to recent polls, could face a revolt within her coalition and Germany's broader economic policy establishment if she agreed to joint bond issuance.             

Her coalition partners, the Free Democrats (FDP) and the Bavarian Christian Social Union (CSU), are seen as dead-set against the idea.             

The leadership of the FDP have set a meeting for Wednesday to discuss their stance on the euro crisis, which will be chaired by Roesler, a party spokesman said.      

German media reports have said a working group within Merkel's own Christian Democrats (CDU) has been studying the idea of eurobonds in greater detail, suggesting some may be open to it.

But leading members of the party have ruled it out in clear terms in recent weeks and other northern European member states, such as the Netherlands and Finland are also vehemently opposed. 

Boerner of the BGA said, however, that eurobonds may be the only solution that can prevent the markets from launching new assaults on eurozone members.  

'We must show the markets that we are ready to use the appropriate tools, and that means eurobonds signed off by Germany,' said Boerner.

'We need eurobonds with strict conditions attached. We need this and we need it fast.'
