Margaret Rohner worried about her troubled adult son not taking his psychiatric medications and had been trying to find him proper care in the years leading up to her horrifying murder at his hands.

The 45-year-old Rohner was viciously attacked Dec 26 with a fireplace poker and knife, her torso butchered and her intestines pulled out by son Robert O. Rankin, who was charged with murder after police said he confessed to the killing.

It was a tragic end for a woman who had spent years trying to find appropriate care for her son she called Bobby, a person she desperately wanted to help after doctors took him off medication prescribed to treat schizophrenia.

Friends say she spent four years guiding Bobby through hospitalizations, changing medications and doctors, and various treatment programs for his mental illness without much improvement in his mental state.

The recent breast cancer survivor, was rewarded for her efforts by bearing the brunt of Bobby's angry rants while holding out hope that her only child would find the right combination of treatment.

'He was in and out of that system for four years, and all we ended up with was a disaster, a tragedy,' Robert Rankin Jr., Rohner's former husband and Bobby's father, said in an interview.

Rankin said his son has been diagnosed with a form of schizophrenia.

The case highlights many of the issues state policymakers have been wrestling with in the wake of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting by 20-year-old Adam Lanza, who killed his mother before gunning down 20 first-graders and six educators on Dec. 14, 2012.

One task force is compiling recommendations for legislators to consider regarding mental health services for patients ages 16 to 25. State Sen. Dante Bartolomeo, who has pushed for improved mental health services for children, said one challenge for young people with psychiatric problems is that once they become adults, treatment is generally voluntary and "medication compliance does become a problem."

Another commission is looking into whether Lanza's mother had difficulty accessing treatment services for her son, who was diagnosed with a form of autism that isn't associated with violent behavior.

On Friday, Gov. Dannel P. Malloy announced that his new budget will include additional funding for mental health care, including residential and transitional services for young adults with serious mental illness, something Rohner was hoping to find for her son.

Bobby Rankin, who hasn't entered a plea to the murder charge, is being held at Garner Correctional Institution in Newtown. His attorney, Dennis P. McMahon, said Bobby has serious psychological problems and he's been advised not to visit him because of his fragile mental condition.

'He's struggling with this now,' McMahon said. 'I don't think he understands what is happening.'

Several of Rohner's friends and customers described her steadfast efforts to fight for the right treatment for her son and her dream to find him long-term, supportive housing.

Sally D'Aquila, who hired Rohner to clean her house and work on her garden, said Rohner would frequently be on the phone with doctors and social workers, trying to manage her son's care. D'Aquila said Rohner 'wanted so desperately for him to be normal, if there is such an animal.'

'I think she often felt there was nothing there. She was just on her own with no one to help her,' D'Aquila said. 'That's a pretty lonely place to be.'

Patricia Unan, a close friend, said Rohner expressed frustration to her Dec. 19 about Bobby's deteriorating mental condition since he stopped taking his medications. Bobby for months had been receiving residential respite services offered at River Valley Services in Middletown, a program run by the state Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services, according to Bobby's father.

'She told me she'd pleaded with the person she spoke with (at River Valley Services) to hospitalize him and force meds because she recognized when he was headed for a break down from previous experiences,' Unan wrote in an email. 'She said they told her they wanted to wait until after the holiday to address the situation.'

Mary Mason, a DMHAS spokeswoman, 
couldn't confirm whether Bobby was a client, citing patient 
confidentiality laws. But she described the respite program as a 
voluntary alternative to a hospitalization, where temporary, supportive 
housing is provided. She said patients can check themselves out but need
 to notify staff when they're leaving.

Bobby's
 father picked him up Dec. 23, not wanting his son to spend the holiday 
away from family. The elder Rankin understood Rohner didn't want Bobby 
to come to her house because he hadn't been taking his medications, 
which often prompted outbursts directed at his mother.

Robert
 Rankin Jr. said Bobby, who wore his hair closely cropped and a bushy 
beard, appeared distant, but he saw nothing out of the ordinary and the 
staff didn't express any concerns. In hindsight, he doesn't believe his 
son should have been allowed to go home.

'I'm sure Margaret told them more than once, `When he's not on his meds, I'm threatened by him,' Rankin said.

Rankin
 and Rohner have been divorced for about 20 years but remained friends 
and lived about a half mile apart. When they saw each other on Christmas
 Eve, Rankin said Rohner told him that she wanted to see Bobby on 
Christmas and give him presents.

'She basically said, `How's he been?' And I said, `Fine, for the most part. He's been fine,' Rankin said.

To Rankin's surprise, Rohner decided 
to let Bobby spend Christmas night at her home, where he typically 
stayed when he wasn't in Middletown.

Bobby
 spent an uneventful night with Rohner and her boyfriend, Jack Adanti. 
But soon after Adanti left the house on Dec. 26 to run errands, Rohner 
was killed. The young man once known as a kind, high honors student with
 good manners and who had been accepted to Hofstra University told his 
father afterward that he was 'sick and tired of being sick and tired.' 
State police say he immediately confessed to killing Rohner, telling a 
trooper: 'I used the knife to kill my mother.'

Adanti
 is still stunned by what happened, saying Bobby was quiet when he left 
that morning. Bobby even shook his hand and thanked him for his 
Christmas presents.

'If I 
had the slightest inclination that anything was wrong, I wouldn't have 
left,' he said. 'That's going to haunt me for a long time. Probably 
forever.'

Adanti said he knew about Rohner's recent concerns about Bobby not taking his medications but that she really wanted him home for the holiday.

'Love is going to overcome caution, and you want to love your kid,' he said. 'You don't want to be afraid. You don't want to push him away.'

Adanti has kept Rohner's text messages on his phone, including one from Dec. 4 about a conversation they had about Bobby and his problems.

'Thank you for listening,' she wrote. 'Sometimes my strength gets tested, but as you know, I'll survive.'
