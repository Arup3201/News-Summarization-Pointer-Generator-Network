One of Real Madrid's leading figures has stated he would love to face Jose Mourinho's Chelsea in the Champions League following a series of digs at the La Liga giants by the Portuguese tactician.

Mourinho recently criticised Real Madrid's first team stars by saying he had missed being in love with his players during his time at the Santiago Bernabeu.

And his latest remark appears to have angered a senior Real Madrid star. Speaking to Marca, the unnamed player said: 'Hopefully we'll face him in the Champions League. If we reach the final, here's hoping it's against Chelsea. Then we'll do our talking.

'He should leave us alone. It's water under the bridge and we're just doing our thing.'

The Spanish newspaper claims Alvaro Arbeloa, Raphael Varane and Sami Khedira are the only players who have kept in touch with Mourinho.

AS focus on Fernando Torres' impending loan move to former side Atletico Madrid.

Torres, who will join AC Milan on a permanent basis from Chelsea in January, is closing in on a move back to his boyhood club.

Italian publication La Gazzetta Sportiva suggest Juventus are tracking Galatasaray playmaker Wesley Sneijder.

The Dutchman has been linked with a move to the Premier League, however The Old Lady are keen on tempting him back to Serie A.

Atletico Madrid's Alessio Cerci is expected to swap places with Torres as the Italian international is closing in on a move to AC Milan, according to Corriere dello Sport.
