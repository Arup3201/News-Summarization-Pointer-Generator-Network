The sons and daughters of the late founder of the Benihana restaurant chain are trying to stop their father's widow from wasting their $50million inheritance.

The six children of Hiroaki 'Rocky' Aoki assumed legal control of their father's sizable estate earlier this year after a long, bitter legal battle, but are still at the whims of its trustee, stepmom Keiko.

Page Six reports the kids, including DJ Steven Aoki - a millionaire in his own right - and model Devon Aoki, have no access to the money until each turns 45. Steven and Devon are in their 30s.

The money is currently in a stock-holding trust invested in Benihana of Tokyo and operated by Keiko.

Benihana of Tokyo, which operates restaurants overseas and in Hawaii, has been the benefactor of some questionable gimmicks, according to a suit filed in the Manhattan Surrogate's Court.  

Funds have gone to pay to fly around the Beni Girls, a duo of hip-hop dancers performs in Benihana chef attire at restaurants and during promotional events, the suit claims.

Court documents called it an 'odd attempt to entertain guests.'

Keiko also introduced a Japanese-style burger called the Beni Burger at Honolulu Benihana that drew a lawsuit from Benihana Inc, a company outside the family that currents owns the license.

The children's stepmother reportedly initiated three 'frivolous' lawsuits of her own against Benihana Inc, two of which she already lost.

But even during Aoki's lifetime, his relationship with his children was tempestuous - and litigious - with the elder restaurateur initiating his own lawsuit against his four other children in 2006.

'I want to help my kids, but I want my children to crawl, to walk, then run on their own,' Aoki told New York Magazine at the time, explaining his decision to rewrite his will to give Keiko control over how to dispense his estate after his death.

Aoki was worried over how his heirs were trying 'wrest control' over his business, and was bitter over how they had let Benihana of Tokyo lose its controlling interest in Benihana Inc.

Steven and Devon had, at the time, reportedly avoided their father's wrath, not being very close to the patriarch. 

The lawsuit was still unsettled at the time of Aoki's death in 2008 at the age of 69 and taken up by Keiko.  

Restaurateur: Aoki founded the Benihana chain, which popularized the teppanyaki style of restaurant service in the United States, in 1964

Benihana - founded in New York and with headquarters in Florida - now owns or franchises 116 Japanese restaurants around the world
