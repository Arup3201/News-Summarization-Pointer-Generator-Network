Angel di Maria's old mansion is up for sale - but Manchester United fans need not worry that it means he is on his way out of Old Trafford.

The Argentina international has not returned to the £4.15million, luxury six-bedroom pad in the leafy Cheshire village of Prestbury since an attempted break-in at the end of January.

He moved with his family to The Lowry Hotel in Manchester city centre where they had a round-the-clock-security team.

Angel di Maria's drop in form can be put down to the break-in at his house 

But Sportsmail understands the Di Marias are no longer at the hotel and have found more long-term alternative accommodation at the Beetham Tower.

The 27-year-old winger rented the stunning property, which features an indoor swimming pool, children's TV room, office, gym, changing rooms and apartment for staff, following his £60m switch to Old Trafford.

Last month, Di Maria and his family suffered a 'terrifying raid' while inside the house.

The player, who has struggled for form since his move from Spain, was reportedly having dinner with his wife, Jorgelina, and children as crooks tried in vain to smash through his patio doors.The three would-be thieves then fled empty-handed after triggering an alarm system.

It is understood the house owner is now looking to sell the property but would be open to renting it again. 

A source said: 'It was a very unfortunate scenario and something that is very, very rare. The house is absolutely beautiful.'

The advert, on Rightmove, states: 'Magnificent mansion set in well-manicured grounds in the heart of Prestbury on a private road. Indoor swimming pool with glass panels into the sitting room and hallway which truly envelopes the pool into the heart of the house.'

United assistant Ryan Giggs insists Di Maria is not suffering from a crisis of confidence, however, and expects him to play a major role in their push for FA Cup glory and Champions League qualification.

'I think his confidence is fine,' Giggs said. 'He's a quality player and we'll be looking for him to produce because it is big game after big game now.

'Players get used to different leagues, sometimes quickly and sometimes it takes a bit of time. He had a really good start to the season but with players who take risks and who can win games it's always difficult to be consistent because they will try things that other players won't do.

'They're capable of doing that and that's why they're match-winners and the best players.'

Di Maria has been replaced in Manchester United's last two Premier League games before the end
