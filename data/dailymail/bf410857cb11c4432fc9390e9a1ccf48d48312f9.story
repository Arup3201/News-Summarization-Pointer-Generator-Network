Actress Susan Sarandon has been slammed as 'positively obscene' after calling Pope Benedict XVI a 'Nazi' during a public interview at a New York film festival.

The Oscar-winner was speaking in front of an audience at the Hamptons Film Festival on Saturday when she made her remark.

Ms Sarandon was recounting the time she sent a copy of Sister Helen Prejean's book Dead Man Walking - the film adaptation of which she starred in and won an Oscar for - to 'the Pope' in the mid-1990s.

Controversy: Susan Sarandon onstage at the Hamptons Film Festival in New York on Saturday. During the interview she called Pope Benedict XVI a 'Nazi'

She clarified that she was referring to Pope John Paul II by adding: 'The last one, not this Nazi one we have now.'

When her interviewer, actor Bob Batalan, 
gently chided her for the remark, Ms Sarandon again repeated it to a 
quiet murmur of laughter from the crowd.

But Catholic groups have been quick to hit out at the 65-year-old, saying her quip 'bespeaks unparalleled ignorance'.

Pope Benedict, 84, was born Joseph Ratzinger in Marktl, Germany, in 1927.

As a 14-year-old during World War Two, he was forced into the Hitler Youth, even though his Bavarian parents despised the Third Reich.

In 2006, a year after his election as pontiff, he visited the Auschwitz death camp where he expressed horror at the Holocaust.

He also said that the Nazis, by attempting to destroy the Jews, were striking at the root of the Catholic faith.

Catholic League president Bill Donohue said: 'Joseph Ratzinger [the Pope] was conscripted into the Nazi Youth the way every other 14-year-old German boy was at the time.

'Unlike most others, he not only refused to go to the compulsory meetings, he actually deserted the Hitler Youth.

'Which is precisely why Jews today regard him as a friend, not as an enemy.'

The Anti-Defamation League, which fights anti-Semitism, called on Sarandon to apologise to the Catholic Community.

In a statement, it said: 'Ms Sarandon
 may have her differences with the Catholic Church, but that is no 
excuse for throwing around Nazi analogies.

'Such words are hateful, vindictive and only serve to diminish the true history and meaning of the Holocaust.'

Ms Sarandon, who was raised in New York 
as a Roman Catholic, is known for her support of causes ranging from 
hunger and Aids to opposing the U.S.-led war in Iraq. She was appointed a
 UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador in 1999.

Blessing: German-born Pope Benedict was briefly a member of the Hitler Youth in the early 1940s when membership was compulsory

German-born Pope Benedict, formerly 
Joseph Ratzinger, was briefly a member of the Hitler Youth in the early 
1940s when membership was compulsory, the Vatican has said.

He deserted the military during World War Two and has said that as devout Catholics, his parents rejected Nazi ideology.

During the interview, Ms Sarandon also touched on the Occupy Wall Street 
protests currently taking place in lower Manhattan.

She
 also spoke of her former run-ins with the New York Police Department 
over the shooting of a Guinean immigrant, Amadou Diallo, in 1999.
