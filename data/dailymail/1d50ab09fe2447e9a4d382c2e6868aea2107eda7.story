Tour de France champion Chris Froome has become the first person ever to cycle under the sea from England to France.

The cycling star, 29, pedalled 32 miles from Folkestone to Calais in the Eurotunnel.

It is the first time in history anyone has cycled through the tunnel, with Froome completing the task in 55 minutes.

Incredible: Chris Froome has become the first person to scale the length of the Eurotunnel on a bicycle. The Tour de France champion did it in 55 minutes

He was cycling at 'training pace', which still saw the super-fit sports star reaching speeds of 40mph.

A train, in comparison, takes 35 minutes to carry out the trip and hits 100mph as it travels 150ft beneath the English channel.

Froome, who is currently competing in this year’s Tour de France, today described the experience as 'incredible'.

He said: 'Cycling under the sea was an incredible experience.

On your marks: He started at the industrial yellow iron gate in Folkestone, England, which leads all the way to Calais under the sea

Eerie: In a video released of the cycle ride last month, the 29-year-old is seen pacing through the concrete walls lit by harsh white lights

Speed: It takes a train 35 minutes to make the journey, driving at 100mph. Froome, who took the yellow jersey last year, achieved it in 55 minutes at 40mph

'Opportunities to become the first 
person in the world to achieve these kind of feats are extremely rare 
nowadays, especially as a pro-cyclist.

'To
 become the first person ever to cycle through the Eurotunnel was right 
up there with some of the most iconic rides I’ve ever done - this must 
have been one of very few ‘world first’ rides left.'

The service tunnel which Froome cycled through is one of the highest security sites in the UK and France.

Training: In the run up to this year's Tour de France, which started in Yorkshire, Froome was 'only cycling at training pace'

Race is on: A Jaguar boarded the train decked with Team Sky's bikes to meet him at the other end. They were only waiting 20 minutes for him to arrive

Chilled: As Team Sky greeted the champion cyclist, he looked relaxed, gliding out the 'shuttle' with a smile on his face and an arm in the air

It was organised last month by Jaguar, which provides Team Sky, who Froome cycles for, with a fleet of XF Sportbrakes.

Jaguar will be releasing a film, 'Team Sky - Cycling Under The Sea', to celebrate the event.

John Keefe, head of public affairs at Eurotunnel, added: 'The Eurotunnel is an incredible, unique piece of engineering on par with the Golden Gate Bridge or Sydney Opera House.

'The problem of course, is that no one gets to see it, so we were delighted when Jaguar Land Rover came to us with this ground-breaking request'.
