A transgender widow of a Texas firefighter who died in a blaze is taking her fight for his benefits to an appeals court after it was ruled that their marriage was not legally binding.

Nikki Araguz, who celebrated a wedding ceremony with her second husband this week, was married to volunteer firefighter Thomas Araguz when he died while fighting a fire three years ago.

She says she's entitled to the Wharton County firefighter's death benefits as she had changed her gender on her birth certificate and they were married in 2008.

But Houston state district Judge Randy 
Clapp ruled in 2011 that Araguz was born male and that the state's 2005 marriage 
amendment does not recognize same-sex marriages.

Araguz's first wife, Heather Delgado, sued to have Araguz's marriage declared entirely void so that she could receive benefits instead to take care of the sons she had with the fallen firefighter.

Araguz lost her appeal to the ruling in 2012. But in an interview with ABC News, she resolved to keep fighting on behalf of the transgender community.

'As difficult as this has been for me in my grief, I cannot in good conscience allow someone else to go through this again,' she said.

The appeal comes as Araguz celebrated a marriage ceremony with her second husband, WIlliam Loyd, The Corpus Christi Caller-Times reported.

They shared the ceremony in front of the Nueces County Courthouse surrounded by a small group of family and friends in Corpus Christi, Texas on Wednesday.

The celebration came despite their struggle to achieve a marriage license because Texas law still considers Araguz a male, even though she presented documentation showing her gender transition, KHOU reported.

Mrs Araguz, who was born Justin Graham Purdue, legally changed her name to Nikki Paige Purdue in 1996, and married Mr Araguz in 2008. She underwent a sex-change operation that October.Â 

Her husband died at a fire at an egg farm in Boling, Texas, on July 4 2010.

His estate was frozen after the launch of the lawsuit which claimed that he did not know the truth about his wife's sexual identity, a claim she has rejected.

'My husband and I loved each other very, very much,' Araguz told the Houston Chronicle on Sunday. 'We had a completely honest marriage, a 100 percent loving, honest marriage.'

Happy: Araguz, pictured with Lloyd, continues to battle for her late husband's benefits, saying she will not give up the fight because she wants to improve conditions for the transgender community

The widow now lives in Houston, 60 miles northeast of Wharton, where she works as a public speaker and activist for the transgender community.

She has also started a business with her new husband called The Starving Artist, where she's selling her handmade jewelry and hopes to star in a TV reality show.

According to her attorney, Mrs Araguz is entitled to a weekly benefits for the rest of her life, or 104 weeks in a lump sum if she remarries.

In the latest appeal, three judges from 
the 13th Texas Court of Appeals heard arguments in the case on Wednesday
but they have not announced a timetable on a ruling.
