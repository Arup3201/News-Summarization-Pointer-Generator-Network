George Michael is used to delivering show-stopping performances when he takes to the stage.

But on Thursday, the stage was the M1 near St Albans, Hertfordshire, which was closed after the singer was involved in a crash in his Range Rover during rush hour.

Michael was recovering last night after being airlifted to hospital with a head injury following the accident.

Worry: The M1 is brought to a standstill as George Michael is checked after a crash in his Range Rover

An ambulance crew was so concerned at
 the 49-year-old’s condition that a  helicopter was summoned, and the 
motorway was closed for half an hour while it landed to take Michael 
away.

Although the ambulance service said 
he suffered a head injury, Michael was well enough to be discharged from
 hospital last night.

No other vehicle was involved in the incident, which happened just before 6pm near the junction with the M25.

His spokesman Connie Filippello said: ‘George Michael was a passenger in a vehicle involved in a traffic accident, no third party was involved. He is being treated for superficial cuts and bruises but is fine. We have no further comment at this time.’

The singer, who has enjoyed a successful solo career since finding fame in the 1980s duo Wham!, is banned from driving.

Three years ago he was jailed for eight weeks for crashing a Range Rover into a shop in north London while under the influence of drugs.

In July 2010 George Michael famously crashed his Range Rover into a shop in north London.

the following September he received an eight-week prison sentence.

He
 was also given a five-year driving ban after he pleaded guilty to 
driving under the influence of drugs and possessing cannabis.

The star had earlier been banned from driving for two years and sentenced to 100 hours of community service in 2006.

He had been convicted of driving while unfit through drugs after he was found collapsed in his Mercedes.

He was also disqualified from driving for five years, having served a two-year ban imposed in 2006 when he was convicted of driving while on drugs after being found slumped in his Mercedes.

Speaking at the singer’s home in Highgate, North London, last night, Michael’s boyfriend Fadi Fawaz, 39, said: ‘He is perfectly fine. Of course I was worried, but I have spoken to him and he is good.‘He suffered a few bruises but there is nothing to worry about. I have no idea what happened, I wasn’t there.’

Hertfordshire Police said: ‘The exact  circumstances of what happened are unclear at this time, and until further investigations have been carried out it would be inappropriate for us to comment further.’

An East of England Ambulance Service spokesman said that a 49-year-old man ‘sustained a head injury and following treatment, stabilisation and immobilisation by land and air ambulance crews, he was flown to hospital for further care’.

Only 18 months ago, Michael – real name Georgios Panayiotou – spent a month fighting for his life in an Austrian hospital after a severe bout of pneumonia. He fell ill while preparing for a concert in Vienna, and needed a tracheotomy to keep him breathing when he slipped into a coma.
