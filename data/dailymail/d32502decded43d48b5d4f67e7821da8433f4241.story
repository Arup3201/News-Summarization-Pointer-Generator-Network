They may look like plain old photographs of road sides and supermarkets, but these meticulous images take hours to construct.

It is the latest series of camouflage trickery unveiled by artist Liu Bolin, or 'the invisible man', who made his name blending into the background of everyday scenes.

The new shots, now exhibited at the Eli Klein Fine Art gallery in New York, shows him melting into shelves packed with soft toys, fruit and vegetables, and a magazine rack.

Now you see him, now you don't: Mr Bolin, 40, spends 10 hours painting himself for each photograph

The 40-year-old, who has spent years perfecting the art, says the images are a statement of his role in society.

'Each one chooses his or her path to come in contact with the external world. I chose to merge with the environment,' he said.

When he is posing for the shots - after 10 hours of make up - he claims even passers-by do not know he is there.

Mr Bolin, who is also a sculptor and painter, goes through swathes of clothes as he smears them with paint for each image.

In another, he manages to disappear into the grey of a a huge aircraft carrier docked in New York.

A third shows him camouflaged into a rack of magazines - making it hard to see where they end and he begins.
