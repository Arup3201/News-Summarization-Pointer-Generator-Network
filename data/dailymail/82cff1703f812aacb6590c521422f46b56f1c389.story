A 13-month-old baby girl in the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen is suffering from a rare, undiagnosed disease which is preventing her from growing.

The parents have turned to the media now to find medical experts who could provide help and a formal diagnosis.

The infant, named Yuanyuan, weighs about 2.9 kg and measures in at 10cm.

Since birth, Yuanyuan has only gained 0.5kg in weight, which is less than a quarter of what a healthy baby should have gained in that time frame.

She has grown only 10cm, less than half of what she should have, and bears a resemblance to Benjamin Button - a character created by U.S. author F. Scott Fitzgerald. [related]

Fitzgerald's short story, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, tells the story of a man who was born with the looks of a 70-year-old man and ages backwards.

It was given the silver screen treatment in 2008, starring Brad Pitt as the title character.

The parents have spent about 100,000 Chinese yuan - or more than AU$17,000 - on treatments, which has exhausted their savings, and they still do not know the cause of the disease or what is the appropriate treatment.

The baby can only consume small amounts of breast milk and a formula known as sips, where a baby formula is injected through a hose attached to her nose.

It takes her about two hours to eat 30 millilitres of milk.

The baby is malnourished and her immunity is growing weak. 

Her parents say she can express joy through eye contact, but is unable to make any noises.

She also has symptoms of eczema, requiring ointment to be applied after bathing. 

A doctor in Shanghai, Xiao Yuan, responded to the parents call for help on Weibo - a microblogging service - saying that Yuanyuan may have a digestive system disease.

Dr Xiao suggested the parents take the baby to a hospital in Shanghai.
