A 42-year-old Florida man was arrested Monday after going on a drunken rampage at his mother's home - where he also lives - after she asked him why he hadn't gone to work that day.

By the time Paul Rossi's rampage was over, his mother's house was destroyed, her television and some furniture had been thrown in the swimming pool and she was telling police to throw her son in jail.

Rossi, of Port St. Lucie, was booked into jail on charges of aggravated assault and battery after he allegedly used a baseball bat to destroy his mother's home during his booze-fueled rampage, authorities say.

Wet: Rossi allegedly threw his mother's TV - as well as some of her furniture - in her pool

Rossi's mother called 9-1-1 after she knocked on his bedroom door to ask why he hadn't gone to work.

Rossi - according to his mother - has issues with depression and addiction, and has been on an alcohol 'binge' for the last several days.

'He's an alcoholic,' Rossi's mother told the 911 operator in an audio recording first obtained by WPBF.com. 'He needs to go to 
jail. I don't care if he's drunk or not. He's throwing stuff at me.'

In the recording of the 9-1-1 call, Rossi can be heard in the background smashing things as his fearful mother explains to the dispatcher that her son was destroying her home.

'He was stumbling through the house and he went in his room and slammed 
the door,' Rossi's mother told the 911 operator. 'I went in the room after him 
because there's a sink full of soap and I asked him what it was, and he 
was smoking in bed which he's not allowed to do. I took the ash tray and
 put it outside and took the cigarette, and he said I attacked him.'

Rossi's mother retreated to her vehicle as her son continued to smash things inside the house with the baseball bat. However, he soon left the home and shifted his focus to his mother's car.

'He's breaking my car window. He broke both of my car windows with me 
sitting in the car ... with a baseball bat,' his mother said on the 9-1-1 recording.

Police arrived at the home and discovered Rossi's path of destruction, which included the TV and furniture in the pool, shattered antiques, dishes and other glass collectibles. Authorities also discovered Rossi's mother's car, which had the driver's side window shattered and was covered in dents, presumably from getting hit with a baseball bat.

Rossi surrendered to police without incident.
