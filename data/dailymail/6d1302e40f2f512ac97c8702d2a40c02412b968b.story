A young Welsh lingerie designer has landed the job of a lifetime with a major American fashion label - thanks to a chandelier hanging in a hotel.

Kate Howard, 22, was inspired to create a range of sexy underwear after seeing the delicate glass chandelier in the lobby of London's Claridge's hotel.

And Kate's designs based on the light have won her a job with major fashion label Abercrombie & Fitch.

Job of a lifetime: Student fashion designer Kate Howard, 22, has landed her dream job with American fashion giant Abercrombie & Fitch after an Apprentice style selection process

Kate was one of 28 talented young British fashion designers flown to the company's headquarters in Ohio to compete in a design competition for a job at the prestigious company.

She went out armed with a suitcase containing her delicately made underwear and photographs of models wearing it on the catwalk.

The candidates were put through a rigorous selection process similar to BBC's The Apprentice show.

After a tough week Kate returned home to Merthyr Tydfil, South Wales, unaware she had landed a job with the company.

Determination: Kate flew to the States armed with a suitcase containing her delicately made underwear and photographs of models wearing it on the catwalk

But a letter arrived offering her a $42,000 (£27,000) a year job in the States.

Speaking about her success, Kate said: 'I saw the chandelier in Claridge's and fell in love with it.

'I used it as an inspiration for my lingerie - the chandelier has all the vintage glamour and layered style that I wanted to replicate.

'People think I'm crazy when I tell them how my sketches of a chandelier turned into a catwalk collection of undies.

'But designers get their ideas from all sorts of places and the chandelier really sparked my imagination.'

Talent: Kate graduated from Leicester's De Montfort University where she studied fashion design and corsetry and made garments such as these

Kate has just graduated from Leicester's De Montfort University after four years studying fashion design and corsetry.

She was working on one of her latest designs in the university's sewing room when she heard Abercrombie & Fitch were offering her a job.

Kate said: 'I was crying my heart out - I was so happy.

'I'm absolutely thrilled that I've got the job. I haven't stopped smiling since I found out.

'My parents are chuffed for me too. Ohio is so far from home but they are proud as punch and know working for Abercrombie & Fitch is such a huge opportunity.'

Creative: Claridge's hotel say they are very happy that their chandelier inspired her work and landed her the dream job

Kate plans to celebrate by having afternoon tea at Claridge's before she starts her new job in October.

The striking chandelier created by American glass sculptor Dale Chihuly is made of 300 hand-blown glass pieces.

The piece was commissioned for £1 million in 2012 and hangs in the main lobby of Claridge's.

A spokesman for the prestigious London hotel said: 'We are delighted our chandelier has played a part in Kate's success.'

And Kate isn't the only former student of the De Montfort University Contour Fashion course – which is widely regarded as one of the best in the world by industry experts.

Classmates Eve Cotterill, Jade Boggis, and Jodi-Ann Fowler, will all be jetting off to Hong Kong to begin their careers with leading lingerie manufacturer Clover Group International Limited – suppliers of some of the biggest names in the industry, including Victoria’s Secret.

Rachel Davies will begin working for high-street giant H&M and will be based in Stockholm, Sweden., while Chelsea Wilshaw has joined luxury lingerie brand Agent Provocateur and Anneliese Pugh will be working for full-bust brand Curvy Kate – who supply lingerie to some of the biggest fashion retailers, including New Look, ASOS, Next and Debenhams.

Success: Kate will celebrate her win by going for a lovely afternoon tea at Claridge's hotel
