Double-trouble: The Nationwide Building Society confirmed problems with some payments this week.

Britain's biggest building society 
left more than 700,000 customers out of pocket yesterday after a basic 
computer error took payments from their accounts twice.

An estimated 704,000 Nationwide 
account holders saw cash – in some cases thousands of pounds – wrongly 
snatched out of their current account.

Every debit card payment was deducted as normal on Tuesday – but then taken again on Wednesday.

In another blow to the UK’s 
beleaguered banks and building societies, NatWest’s online service froze
yesterday, leaving up to 11.5million customers locked out and unable to
access their cash.

The Nationwide error hit 50,000 people
so badly that they were forced into unauthorised overdrafts which stung
them with penalties of up to £100, had card purchases turned down or 
saw cash requests at ATMs rejected.

Others relying on a minimum sum in 
their account risked missing mortgage payments.

Nationwide blamed ‘human error’ and 
said the money would be refunded this morning.

But it will be up to 
those who suffer a stain on their credit record to contact credit 
reference agencies themselves to clear up the mess.

Angry customers took to the internet 
to vent their fury at the chaos. Steve Jones, from Wales, complained: 
‘My account was twice debited with £1,200 – I couldn’t get cash out at 
the ATM and it says I’m now overdrawn for the first time in my life. 
Unbelievable.’

Yesterday’s blow emerged just weeks 
after Nationwide boasted how it had received a 67 per cent surge in new 
customers following the disastrous IT meltdown at RBS. It has pumped 
millions into a high-profile advertising campaign tapping into the 
public sense of outrage against high street banks.

Nationwide praised its virtues as a 
building society – where savers and borrowers effectively own the 
business. However, last night experts said there was little to choose 
between Nationwide and RBS in the way they had treated their customers 
following the problems.

Twoutrage: Customers take to social media for answers after finding payments had been taken from their account twice.

Marc Gander, of consumer champion 
Consumer Action Group, said: ‘This is a total laugh. Nationwide ought to
have been much more careful before it started crowing about the fact it
was different to the big high street banks.’

Nationwide said people left penniless 
by the problems would be able to ask the bank for an emergency payout.

But the Daily Mail received reports from readers who were turned down 
when they resorted to begging staff for help or for a £10 payout to tide
them over.

Nationwide spokesman Jenny Groves 
said: ‘We apologise to those customers affected by an issue which has 
affected some of our debit card customers. All charges will be refunded 
in full and any costs associated with this error will be reimbursed in 
full.’

More problems: RBS group customers reported difficulties this afternoon with online banking and credit cards - the second time this month that bank - parent to Natwest - has had technical difficulties

NatWest’s online problems came only a 
month after its reputation was damaged by a massive computer crash. 
Yesterday’s website freeze meant many customers struggled to use 
internet banking services and ran into problems paying for goods with 
their debit cards.

John Grafham, whose business and personal accounts were hit by both rounds of IT failures, yesterday said he would switch banks.

The 64-year-old from High Wickham, who runs a consultancy firm, said: ‘This is simply not good enough.’

Jo Roberts from Warwickshire said: ‘I 
had my NatWest card “declined” at Asda and my shopping taken away. It 
was so embarrassing.’

An RBS spokesman said: ‘Some of our 
customers are experiencing technical difficulties with online banking 
and debit cards. We are working hard to resolve this.’
