Hip-hop star Jay-Z is buying a
Scandinavian music streaming company for $56 million to take on Spotify and Apple and add to a
business empire that has spanned clothing and sports bars.

Project Panther Bidco Ltd, a company controlled by the
45-year-old rapper, said on Friday it had agreed to buy
Sweden-listed Aspiro, which runs streaming service Tidal and Wimp, for 464 million Swedish crowns
($56 million) in cash.

The deal will pit Jay-Z against Spotify, and also Dr Dre after his streaming service, Beats Music, was bought by Apple.

Jay-Z is buying a Scandinavian music streaming company for $56 million to add to a business empire that has spanned clothing and sports bars

Shares in Aspiro, which runs music streaming service WiMP,leapt 59 percent in early trading to the bid level of 1.05crowns per share.

 'I think they will be a better owner to lift Aspiro and its advanced music streaming service to a new level,' said Trond Berger, the financial director of Norwegian media group Shibsted, currently Aspiro's majority owner.

At the end of the third quarter of 2014, Wimp said it had 512,000 paying users in Germany, Poland and the Nordic countries.

That is a far cry from its Nordic rival Spotify, a pioneer in the streaming music business. 

The unlisted company boasted 15 million paying subscribers in mid-January and is available in 58 countries.

Norwegian business daily Dagens Naeringsliv reported that Jay Z's company was particularly interested in Wimp's high-fidelity Tidal streaming service which is being launched on the US market.

'The Wimp/Tidal service has the potential for greatness, given that it has high-end audio capabilities,' music specialist Simon Dyson at corporate analytics firm Ovum told AFP in an email, adding that the $56-million price tag was 'not excessive'.

Wimp would need substantial investments to challenge Spotify or US tech giant Apple's widely expected entry into the market later this year after acquiring Beats Music from another rap star, Dr Dre, in 2014.

Jay-Z, real name Shawn Corey Carter, is one of the world's
best-selling music artists of all time, having sold more than
100 million records. Forbes estimated last year that his net
worth was $520 million.

Married to Beyonce, Jay-Z has had a number o fbusiness interests, including 40/40 Club sports bars and Rocawear clothing

Married to pop star Beyonce, Jay-Z has had a number of
business interests, including 40/40 Club sports bars and
Rocawear clothing.

His mix of music and entrepeneurial interests mirrors that
of other rappers, including De Dre, who sold his Beats
headphones business to Apple, and 50 Cent, who sold his
vitamin water business to Coca-Cola.

Project Panther said it had followed the development of
Aspiro for some time, believing it to be 'an innovative
high-quality company with strong future growth potential'.

Norwegian media house Schibsted, Aspiro's main
shareholder, said it had accepted the offer, while Aspiro's
board said it was united in recommending the bid, virtually
ensuring its success.

Schibsted owns around 75 percent of Streaming Media AS,
which in turn owns about 76 percent of Aspiro.
