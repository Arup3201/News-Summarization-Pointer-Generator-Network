A brother and sister have been revealed as heroes of the Sikh temple massacre after they spotted the gunman and ran to warn those inside.

Abhay Singh, 11, and his nine-year-old sister Amanat had gone to sit outside the gurdwara on Sunday morning because it was too hot in the temple kitchen.

The children witnessed shooter Michael Page open fire on two people at their place of worship in Oak Creek, Wisconsin.

Bravery: Abhay Singh, 11, and his nine-year-old sister Amanat watched the gunman emerge from a car and open fire before running to warn those inside the Sikh temple

Abhay said they saw a white man emerge from a purple sedan and believed he was coming to ask for directions - before he pulled out pistols and began shooting.

Abhay, whose name means 'fearless', told CNN:
'We ran as fast as we could inside to warn everybody in the kitchen and
everybody else there is a man outside with a gun. We were a little bit 
scared.'

The children ran into the temple kitchen where many of the congregation had gathered to prepare a meal and raised the alarm that a man was on the rampage with a gun. Many fled to pantries to hide.

Abhay and Amanat's parents were not at the temple when the gunman struck, having gone to the store to buy supplies for the meal. They faced a terrifying wait to learn if their children had survived the attack.

Their mother Kanwal said she had prayed that she would see her children again and that she was very proud of them. 

Police confirmed yesterday that neo-Nazi Michael Page, who killed six worshippers 
at the Sikh temple, died after turning the gun on 
himself.

It was originally believed that Wade Michael Page had been killed by a police officer who was wounded after responding to the shooting.

FBI Special agent Teresa Carlson told reporters in Milwaukee that the 41-year-old gunman shot himself in the head after the second police officer responding to the scene shot him in the stomach.

The disturbing moment was caught on camera. A motive has not yet been given for the senseless massacre.
