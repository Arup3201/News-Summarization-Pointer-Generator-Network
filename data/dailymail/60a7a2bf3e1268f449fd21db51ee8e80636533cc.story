The U.S. Air Force has provoked outrage by removing a Latin reference to God on one of its logos after complaints from a military atheist group.

The Rapid Capabilities Office patch included a motto until several weeks ago in Latin saying: ‘Doing God’s Work with Other People’s Money’.

But this was altered to ‘Doing Miracles with Other People’s Money’ after the Military Association of Atheists and Freethinkers kicked up a fuss.

Edit: The Rapid Capabilities Office patch has gone from 'Doing God’s Work with Other People's Money', left, to 'Doing Miracles with Other People’s Money', right

‘It is most egregious,’ Virginia Rep. Randy Forbes told Fox News. ‘The Air Force is taking the tone that you can’t even use the word “God”.’

‘(It is a) bridge too far in terms of the rights of men and women who serve in our services and their ability to express their faith.’

Rep. Forbes has asked the Air Force to revert back to the original logo, which was printed as: ‘Opus Dei Cum Pecunia Alienum Efficemus’.

He has written to Air Force Secretary Michael Donley and Air Force Chief of Staff Norton Schwartz with 35 other politicians, reported Fox News.

A U.S. Air Force spokesman told Fox News that they had received a letter from the lawmakers and will begin a investigation into the claims.

Mr Forbes claimed the removal of the 
reference suggests the Air Force believes the word ‘God’ cannot be used 
in the force at all.

‘The RCO’s action to modify the logo sets
a dangerous precedent that all references to God (must) be removed from
the military,’ he wrote.

Mr Forbes believes the change to ‘Miraculi Cum Pecunia Alienum Efficemus’ is not required to abide with the First Amendment.

The RCO was created nine years ago to speed up weapon systems and reports to a board of directors including top Air Force officials.

Mr Forbes tried to reaffirm ‘In God We Trust’ as the U.S. motto in a bill last November, but Barack Obama was unimpressed, reported The Hill.

‘I trust in God, but God wants to see us help ourselves by putting people back to work,’ President Obama said, reported ABC News at the time.
