The search for missing British student Hannah Graham was broadened at the weekend with canine units and All Terrain Vehicles scouring dense woodland and mountain roads south of Charlottesville for signs of the 18-year-old, who went missing two weeks ago.

'We already have boots on the ground working,' said Mark Eggeman, search and rescue coordinator for the Virginia Department of Emergency Management. 'We have maintained a presence on the scene searching every day since this happened. We have not stopped searching.'

Earlier desperate police offered $100,000 for information that could lead to the safe return of the missing second-year University of Virginia student.

The search area has now been widened to wooded areas south of Charlottesville principally between routes 29 and 20

Hannah Graham was reported missing on September 14, the day after she was caught on surveillance videos as she walked unaccompanied in Charlottesville's Downtown Mall.

Police have identified Jesse Leroy Matthew Jr, a hospital worker, as the last person to be seen with Graham early on the morning of September 13.

Matthew was returned from Texas late Friday after he was found on a beach near Galveston. He is being held without bond at the Charlottesville-Albemarle Regional Jail.

Matthew, 32, is expected to make his first court appearance on Thursday to face a charge of abduction with intent to defile - or sexually molest.

While Charlottesville Police Chief Timothy Longo has encouraged residents of his city of 40,000 and beyond to be aware of any sign of Graham, the team directed by Eggeman brings special skills in its search for her. They are trained, for instance, to detect signs of human movement.

'You're looking for signs of passage, you're looking for the very subtle things that most people who are not trained to do this will walk right past,' Eggeman said.

Custody: Jesse Leroy Matthew Jr., 32, was arrested on a charge of abduction with intent to defile Hannah

Extradited: Matthew was returned from Texas late Friday after he was found on a beach near Galveston and taken to Charlottesville-Albemarle Regional Jail. He is expected to make his first court appearance on Thursday

The team includes volunteers often called in by the state to look for lost hunters or wayward elders. Others taking part include members of the Albemarle County Sheriff's Office. The searchers number about 20 and include about half as many canine units.

Eggeman said the focus of the search is based on investigative leads. He declined to state precisely where searchers were looking Saturday other than to say south of the city in Albemarle County.

'There's a lot of ground to cover,' he said, calling the search part marathon, part process of elimination.

Last weekend, more than 1,200 volunteers searched Charlottesville. The search area has widened to the rolling hills outside of Charlottesville.

Confusion: This map shows Hannah Graham's movements on the night of Friday 12 and Saturday 13. At 11.50pm she was seen at a party by friends with another male friend. She then seemed to head westward toward the Charlottesville Downtown Mall - where she encountered Matthew

To supplement the professional searchers, Longo has encouraged area residents to search their property for any signs of Graham. He also asked real estate agents to search vacant properties.

Longo acknowledged that hope of finding Graham, who was born in Reading, in the UK, dims the more time passes, but he said he remains hopeful.

As for Eggeman, he too remains hopeful as leads continue to pour into Charlottesville investigators. Longo has said more than 1,600 tips have come in.

'Every day there's new information, there's a new lead,' Eggeman said. 'It's like building blocks, it's one thing leads to another.

'As long as they have things to pursue, we will continue to search.'

Hannah's parents, John and Sue, spoke publicly on Sunday for the first time since their 18-year-old daughter's disappearance last week.

Mr Graham said: 'As this nightmare for Hannah, for us, for Hannah's big brother James, her grandparents and extended family continues we would like to make this statement.

'Hannah is our little girl, our only daughter, James's little sister. She is also the oldest granddaughter of her grandparents. She is enormously precious to us.'
