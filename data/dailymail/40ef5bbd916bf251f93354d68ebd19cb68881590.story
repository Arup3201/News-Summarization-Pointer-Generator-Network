The rising star of the New York Knicks might be setting alight the basketball world by leading his team to three straight wins - but he doesn’t quite yet live the high life enjoyed by some of his team-mates.

Jeremy Lin, 23, is currently living on his brother's sofa in Manhattan’s student-dominated Lower East Side - but the Harvard University graduate wants to buy a more permanent high-end property.

The star from Palo Alto, California, whose parents are from Taiwan, scored 23 points and enjoyed a career-high 10 assists to lead the Knicks to a 107-93 rout of the Washington Wizards on Wednesday.

The 6’3” 200lbs economics graduate, who was signed from Golden State Warriors two months ago, is living with his brother Joshua, a New York University dental student, reported the New York Post.

He has been shown two luxury properties by a broker. One is owned by another Knicks player in New York City and the other is close to the side’s practice centre in Greenburgh, New York state.

Lin is the NBA's first Chinese-American and fifth Asian-American. The fervour around his recent amazing performances is dubbed ‘Linsanity’ and he has rescued an otherwise-dire Knicks season.

He will be paid a minimum of $613,567 next season and is expected to star as the Knicks take on the Los Angeles Lakers at Madison Square Garden in Manhattan tonight, reported the New York Post.

‘We never expected anything like this,’ Lin’s dad, Gie-Ming Lin, who has travelled from California to watch his son tonight, told the New York Post. ‘It’s like this happened overnight. We can’t believe it.’

Mr Lin said he brought up his three sons in California with the understanding that their academic education was first, but they were encouraged to train and joined church basketball leagues.

Meanwhile his son Jeremy is making the Knicks must-see TV in Asia, where the NBA’s partners have added games to their broadcast schedules.

Sina in China will show Friday's Lakers game, while stations in Taiwan will show Knicks games this month against Toronto, Sacramento, New Orleans, New Jersey and Atlanta.

Lin has led the Knicks to three straight wins, scoring more than 20 points in each game. But ironically his performances are missed by many in New York.

That’s thanks to a dispute between Time Warner Cable and MSG Network. MSG said its ratings are up 36 per cent over its season average in the two games since Lin moved into the starting line-up.

‘It hasn't even been a week yet,’ Lin said after his amazing performance against the Wizards. ‘I just want to make sure I do what I can to help the team win every time I step out on the floor.

Jeremy Lin

Scores of Asian-Americans at the Verizon Center cheered his every move, holding up signs, and jumping to their feet each time he sliced through the Wizards' defence on Wednesday.

Since he began getting significant minutes, Lin has averaged 25.3 points and 8.3 assists. He came along at a great time for the Knicks, who are on the outside looking in at a play-off spot.

With star players Carmelo Anthony lost for several weeks with a groin injury and Amar'e Stoudemire on an indefinite leave after the death of his brother, the Knicks were desperate for a spark.

‘Jeremy puts everyone in the right spots and calms us down,’ Knicks coach Mike D'Antoni said. ‘He's making things easy and the rest of the guys around him are playing the way we want to play.’
