A young boy died in a car crash after his 15-year-old sister lost control of the family SUV.

Emir Zilkic was riding with his two older siblings, the unlicensed driver and a 14-year-old girl, near their home in Erie, Pennsylvania, on Tuesday night.

The teenage driver had taken the large 4-by-4 without permission and was taking her younger siblings and two friends to McDonald’s when the car came off the road just four blocks from the family home.

Accident: Emir Zilkic, 8, died when this SUV, driven by his 15-year-old sister, flipped off the road near their home in Erie County

Witnesses said the vehicle was speeding when it started rolling, and then flipped through the air.

At least three of the children were thrown out of the car as it flew through the air, but two were pinned underneath as it landed, Erie County Police said.

Emir Zilkic was pronounced dead at the scene just after 9.30pm. The 15-year-old driver, their 14-year-old sister and two other children, a boy aged ten and a girl, 14, were taken to hospital.

The girl behind the wheel suffered a back injury and her sister a broken arm and internal bleeding, their mother Alma Zilkic told GoErie.

‘They say she was speeding, like 80 miles per hour, and lost control. And (Emir's) gone,’ she told the paper.

The family, who hail from Bosnia, has lived in Erie for 14 years and Mrs Zilkic said the accident has hit them hard.

She added that she does not blame her daughter for the accident, as the Erie police continue the investigation of the scene of the crash.

Once a review has been put together, Erie County District Attorney's Office will make a decision on whether to press criminal charges.
