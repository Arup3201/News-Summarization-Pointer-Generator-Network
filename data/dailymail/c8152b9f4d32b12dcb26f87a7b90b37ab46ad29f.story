Read the riot act: Home Secretary Theresa May launched a scathing attack at the findings of a study into the root causes of August's events

Most August rioters were hardened criminals driven by a desire for ‘instant gratification’, Theresa May declared last night.

The Home Secretary rounded on apologists for the summer riots, dismissing claims those involved had been protesting about spending cuts and police harassment.

In an unforgiving speech to the London School of Economics, she criticised the Reading the Riots research it conducted jointly with the Guardian newspaper as ‘limited’, adding that the rioters’ actions were ‘inexcusable’.

The report claimed the rioters were driven by anger over police stop-and-search techniques.

But, to heckles from the audience of academics, Mrs May said: ‘Nearly two thirds of those brought before the courts were charged with either burglary, robbery or theft – so we know the vast mass of rioters weren’t protesting, as they claimed; they were thieving.

‘The riots were about instant gratification.’

Facing down barracking from the audience, Mrs May said the study had ignored the views of victims and the ‘law-abiding majority’ and focused instead on the ‘excuses’ of the rioters.

‘They would of course try to 
rationalise and excuse their inexcusable and irrational behaviour,’ she 
said. Speaking later, she said: ‘What the LSE/Guardian report tells me 
more than anything is that the rioters still have not accepted 
responsibility for their actions.

‘They’re still blaming others – the 
police, the Government, “society”. They’re still making excuses. But I 
don’t accept their excuses because it was their choice to riot and their
crimes had consequences.’

Research conducted by the LSE and Guardian found a deep-seated anger and frustration towards the police was a significant factor behind the riots.

Analysts, who studied 270 interviews with people who took part in the disturbances, said distrust and antipathy towards officers was a key driving force behind why thousands took to the streets.

A complex mix of other political, social and economic factors also contributed, they said.

Out of those questioned, 85 per cent said policing was an 'important' or 'very important' factor in why the riots happened.

It was second only to poverty, which saw 86 per cent of rioters class it as one of the main causes of the four consecutive nights of unrest during the summer.

Poor parenting and gangs were also said to be an important cause of the trouble, which led to the deaths of five people and saw more than 4,000 arrested.

Analysts said the view that the police were 'the biggest gang out there' was a reoccurring theme among rioters.

Mrs May said the research, followed 
extensively by the BBC, lacked a ‘control group’ of non-rioters with 
impartial views. It interviewed very few rioters from outside London, 
she said, three from Nottingham, seven from Salford and 16 from 
Merseyside.

‘It’s important to highlight the limitations of such a study, limitations that I’m sure you also all recognise,’ she said.

‘Rather than listening solely to the 
rioters’ stories, I think it’s important that we take all of the 
evidence together and that we draw a more comprehensive and accurate 
picture of what actually happened this summer.’

Ministry of Justice research showed 
about two-thirds of rioters had convictions or cautions. Yet the 
Guardian/LSE research highlighted the one third without convictions.

The research claimed that  deep-seated
anger and frustration towards the police was a significant factor 
behind the riots, with officers’ incivility a major concern.

Political, social and economic grievances contributed to the unrest, the report said.

But Mrs May said: ‘In fact, on average
each rioter charged had committed 11 previous offences. In other words,
they were career criminals. And these are the very people saying they 
feel harassed by the police.

‘Frankly, I’m delighted that career 
criminals don’t like the police, that they feel the police are always 
targeting them and, as one said, that the police are always “causing 
them hell”.’

The riots broke out in Tottenham, 
North London, on August 6, following the fatal shooting by police of 
alleged drug dealer Mark Duggan. They spread to other parts of the 
capital and to other English cities, including Birmingham, Liverpool, 
Nottingham and Manchester.

■ A thug who set up a Facebook page 
called ‘Letz start a riot’ in August was jailed yesterday. Danny Cook, 
22, of Kidderminster, Worcestershire, had admitted intentionally 
encouraging or assisting in the commission of theft or criminal damage. 
He was jailed for 30 months at Worcester Crown Court.
