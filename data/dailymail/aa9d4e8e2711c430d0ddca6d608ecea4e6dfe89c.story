She's the farm girl with a Harvard education that left a high-flying law career to embark on a life in politics.

But on Tuesday the focus was on Foreign Minister Julie Bishop's new relationship, rather than her policies.

By her side at the Melbourne Cup Carnival was businessman David Panton, and the pair are said to have been dating for around six months, the Daily Telegraph reported.

Mr Panton's two adult daughters Sally and Laura were also at the celebration at Flemington Racecourse earlier this week.

A property investor from Melbourne, Mr Panton recently relocated to the beachside Sydney suburb of Manly from the Melbourne suburb of Shoreham.

According to The Telegraph he and Ms Bishop both share a common passion for sport and fitness.

Mr Panton also has an adult son, Matt, who lives in New York.

Aside from her blossoming relationship, Ms Bishop seems to have gained the approval from voters to be crowned the nation's next leader.

Fairfax poll found Ms Bishop (left) and Tony Abbott (right) both have 20 percent support from voters in preferred leadership stakes

As Australia's first female Foreign Minister and the Liberal Party's first female Deputy Leader, Ms Bishop's popularity has nearly doubled in the past five months.

A Fairfax-Ipsos nationwide poll found Ms Bishop is now level with Prime Minister Tony Abbott in the preferred leadership stakes, who both have 20 per cent of support.

This has been attributed to her strong showing on the international stage - particularly throughout the MH17 crisis in Ukraine - and her calm handling of government affairs in Australia. 

After the figures were released on Tuesday - Melbourne Cup day - she attended Flemington Racecourse in Melbourne with her new love, confirming to the Daily Telegraph the pair had been dating for six months.

But it appears Ms Bishop has no plans of taking the country's top job as she told Daily Mail Australia on Tuesday that she is: 'Living the dream and loving the job'.

'I am in the best job I could ever wish for,' she said.

'It's the job I wanted to do when I went into politics.'

Ms Bishop's popularity has jumped from 11 percent in June to 20 percent.

But both the Foreign Minister and Prime Minister fall into second place behind Communications Minister Malcolm Turnbull who remains the overall choice with 35 percent support. 

The Fairfax poll of 1,401 voters, carried out between Thursday and Sunday, found female voters heavily favoured Mr Turnbull or Ms Bishop.

The surge in support for Ms Bishop could be a result of her strong performance in relation to foreign diplomacy and national security in recent months, the Sydney Morning Herald reports. 

Ms Bishop fiercely confronted Russian President Vladimir Putin late last month at a summit in Italy to question him over the MH17 disaster over the Ukraine.  

The Foreign Minister was also regarded for pushing the resolution the United Nations Security Council passed back in July to allow Australia and other countries access to the Malaysian Airlines crash site to retrieve the bodies. 

Ms Bishop also created close ties with US Secretary of State John Kerry as they signed a Force Posture Agreement during the AUSMIN talks at Admiralty House in Sydney in August this year.

She has also met with powerful figures including US President Barack Obama, First Lady Michelle Obama and Bono - the frontman of music group U2 - during her time in politics.

Ms Bishop grew up on a cherry farm in Adelaide Hills, east of Adelaide, as she attended the prestigious St Peter's Collegiate Girls School where she later graduated as head prefect in 1973.

She was also class captain and debating champion, according to the Daily Telegraph. 

Ms Bishop went on to study law at Adelaide University and graduated in 1978.

Whilst completing an eight-week advanced management program at Harvard Business School in Boston in 1996, she was inspired to enter politics.

Two years later, Ms Bishop won pre-selection for the Liberal Party for the seat of Curtin, Western Australia.

Since then, she's gained a number of titles having served as a Cabinet Minister in the Howard Government as Minister for Education, Science and Training, the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Women's Issues and the Minister for Ageing.  

Ms Bishop married Perth property developer Neil Gillam in 1983 but divorced in 1988.

Afterwards the Foreign Minister dated former Lord Mayor of Perth Dr Peter Nattrass for at least 12 years before stepping out with her new man yesterday.
