Manchester City remain steadfast in their determination to keep Yaya Toure despite fears that the midfielder wants to leave the club.

Reports in the French Press on Tuesday repeated once again the suggestion that Toure is unhappy at the Etihad Stadium and that he is seeking a summer move away from the Manchester club, with PSG his likely destination.

Indeed, the reputable Le Parisien even went as far as to suggest that fellow Premier League sides Chelsea and Manchester United were considering an approach for the 31-year-old.

However, it is understood that City do not intend to allow the player to leave the Etihad Stadium as they look to retain their Premier League title next season. 

It follows a series of peculiar sideshows this summer, after Toure threw his future at the club into doubt when his agent Dimitri Seluk claimed that the club should have made more of a fuss for his 31st birthday, with his representative saying that the midfielder was left ‘very upset’.

City did give Toure a birthday cake and wished him happy birthday on Twitter but the player’s agent suggested he was ignored by the club’s Abu Dhabi owners when the squad visited at then end of the season.

‘None of them shook his hand on his birthday. It’s really sick,’ Seluk added. Toure later backed his agent, writing on Twitter: ‘Everything Dimitri said is true. He speaks for me. I will explain after the World Cup.’

On a more 
serious note, Toure then spoke of his sadness following the death of his
 brother Ibrahim and suggested that his club did not offer him 
sufficient support during a period which he describes as ‘the hardest in
 my life.’

The
 Ivory Coast midfielder’s 28-year-old brother tragically died of cancer 
in June, while Yaya was in Brazil representing his country at the World 
Cup and the City talisman has stated that he felt disappointed that he 
wasn’t afforded greater sensitivity by his club employers, with the 
midfielder alleging that City did not allow him to leave a post-season 
training camp to spend time with his brother.

Toure told France Football: ‘At the end of the season, I wanted to stay for four or five days with my brother before I flew to prepare for the World Cup with Ivory Coast, except that City did not want to grant me a few days.

Manchester City were left disheartened by Toure’s quotes and Sportsmail understands that Toure did not request compassionate leave to spend time with his brother. A senior insider maintained that had Toure asked for those few days off, they would have been granted without hesitation.

Sportsmail also understands that City have been pro-active behind the scenes in supporting the midfielder, both during Ibrahim’s battle with cancer and since his death last week.

City are believed to have pledged their unequivocal support to the family, with the club maintaining dialogue with former player Kolo Toure and brother Yaya, contributing to the arrangements for the funeral and even assisting with the paperwork.

Before Ibrahim died, he was also invited to the club’s Carrington training ground as a special guest.
