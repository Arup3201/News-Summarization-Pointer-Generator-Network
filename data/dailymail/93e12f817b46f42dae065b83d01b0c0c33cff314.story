A mother of four who emigrated from Scotland with her family to start a new life in Australia  has been killed in a car crash.

Shelly Scobbie died in a head-on collision with a Toyota Landcruiser 4x4, which left three of her  four children trapped in the wreckage of her vehicle.

The 31-year-old’s Glasgow-born husband, Jamie, witnessed the tragedy from  the vehicle in which he was travelling ahead of them.

The three youngsters with Mrs Scobbie – who was originally from Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire – were  rescued from their Hyundai Lantra by emergency workers.

However, their mother died at the scene in the Henley Brook area of Perth, Western Australia, the city to which the family moved earlier this year.

The children were taken to hospital, where one had to undergo an operation on his leg, following the accident on Saturday morning. 

They were said to be making a good recovery.

Distraught widower Mr Scobbie now faces bringing up the boys – Connor, Callum, Cameron and Findley – alone.

He has spoken of his heartbreak and paid an emotional tribute to his wife who he refers to as his ‘angel’. In a post on Facebook, Mr Scobbie said: ‘Thank you all for your kind words, thoughts, wishes and prayers. I will take strength from them all at this hard time. My angel will never leave mine and my boys’ hearts.

‘I know she is with us and will live on through the beautiful children she gave me as well as the happy memories that still remain.

‘Rest In Peace my darling, you touched the lives of so many. See you again eventually.’

He later posted a copy of the couple’s wedding song, From the Heart, by British group Another Level, along with a touching message.

He wrote: ‘Our song for our first dance at our wedding. I’m so sorry I couldn’t live up to it baby. I miss you.’

Devastated relatives travelled to be at his side after being told of Mrs Scobbie’s death.

Mr Scobbie’s brother, Graeme, flew out on Monday to comfort him and to help support the couple’s children.

Graeme Scobbie said: ‘I’m devastated and feel totally helpless. It’s always the most amazing, loving, caring people who get taken.

Australian police say they are now investigating the cause of the crash in which the mother of four died

‘I’m completely distraught, but I’m flying out to be by my brother and nephews’ side. I need to be strong for them.’ Family members are now desperately trying to raise enough money to have Mrs Scobbie’s body returned to the UK.

They have estimated that it could cost up to £10,000 and have set up a fundraising page in an attempt to reach their target figure.

A Facebook page where  family and friends can share their memories of Mrs Scobbie and send their support to her husband has also been set up.

The tragic incident took place in the Henley Brook area of Perth, Western Australia

Among those paying tribute was one of the boys, Connor, who left an emotional message to his mother, as well as thanking well-wishers for their support.

He said: ‘Thank you for all those wonderful comments.

‘My mum will be missed but I have managed to acclimatise with her in my head and my heart. God is so lucky for her to come, though.

‘We are crying our sockets out. But we all know this is life and I guarantee she will be watching you all and we will never forget her. Love you mummy.’

Australian police have begun a crash investigation.
