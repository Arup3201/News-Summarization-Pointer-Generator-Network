Police have released CCTV footage of two men they want to speak to about the murder of a church organist on Christmas Eve, as they try to find a motive for his murder.

Alan Greaves, 68, was found beaten and 
collapsed on the pavement close to St Saviour’s Church in High Green, 
Sheffield, late on Christmas Eve.

Police say the 'shining light' of the community was 'brutally murdered', and hope the short CCTV clip, which shows two men walking along a pavement, will refresh the public's memory and help assist the investigation.

Alan Greaves died after being attacked on his way to a Christmas Eve midnight mass

Detectives admitted they have not established a motive for the murder of the lay preacher.

Speaking at a press conference in 
Rotherham, the detective said: 'I still have not established a motive 
for the attack. Alan retains all his property.

'Nothing is missing and my inquiry remains very open in relation to identifying a possible motive for this attack.'

Mr Fenwick said there was nothing in the victim's personal life which would point to a motive.

He said more than 50 officers are working on the case.

Mr Greaves, who died after he was 
attacked on the way to play at Midnight Mass, was attacked with a  weapon
and discovered by a pizza-delivery boy.

He was taken to hospital where he underwent four hours of emergency surgery for multiple head injuries. He died two days later.

Now, South Yorkshire detectives have 
released CCTV footage which hopefully will jog someone's memory that 
could assist with the investigation into the murder.

Detective Superintendent Matt Fenwick
said: 'Alan Greaves was brutally attacked at approximately 11.10pm on 
Christmas Eve on Greengate Lane outside Mortomley Park, High Green, 
Sheffield.

'Alan Greaves was a church organist 
with a strong religious faith and was on his way to church when he was 
assaulted. He was a loving caring husband, father and grandfather who 
was well loved and respected by all who knew him.

'First of all I would like to appeal 
for anyone who was in the Greengate Lane area near to Mortomly Park 
between 10.45pm and 11.15pm on Christmas Eve to contact us as soon as 
possible.

'I would ask 
if anyone living within the High Green area has found anything in their 
garden that is not yours please contact the incident room.

'I would also like to release this CCTV footage of two people who may be able to assist us with our enquiries. If you are either of these two people shown on the footage then please contact us as soon as you can.

'If you know or can identify either 
of these two people please pick up the phone and call the incident room 
on 01709 443723 and tell us what you know.

'I am absolutely convinced that 
someone out there will know who these two are, a mum, a dad, brother, 
sister, another family member or friend.

'Alan Greaves deserves your help. Alan Greaves family deserves your help. Please make that call.'

His wife said she had not stopped crying over the ‘evil that has been done’.

Maureen Greaves led prayers to husband Alan as dozens came together in grief at the first Sunday service since his death.

The
Bishop of Sheffield, who attended the service, paid tribute to the 
devout Anglican and lay preacher, saying the church had lost a ‘shining 
light’.

Support: Mrs Greaves, left, was comforted after she attended the church service where she thanked the congregation for their help, which was led by the Bishop of Sheffield Steven Croft, right

Thanking the congregation for their 
support, Mrs Greaves said: ‘I have prayed constantly for Alan and I know
you have too. I have not stopped crying for him and I know you have not
stopped either.

‘I have wept over the evil that has been done. I have prayed for you and I know you have prayed for me.

‘You were Alan’s Christian family and he loved belonging to this church. I have felt your love towards me.’

Two men, one in his 20s and another in his 40s, were bailed after being arrested on suspicion of murder.

Police believe Mr Greaves was attacked
‘brutally’ with a weapon but have yet to determine what it was and are 
appealing for witnesses.

Respected: Flowers left at the murder scene on Greengate Lane, Sheffield where Mr Greaves was attacked on his way to church

Inquiries: Police carry out investigations close to the scene where Mr Greaves was attacked on Christmas Eve

Mr Greaves, a former social worker who
leaves behind four children and two grandchildren, had played the organ
and preached at his local church for nine years.

He also played the piano for children 
at a primary school and had set up a food bank and community project for
disadvantaged people with his wife.

After the service, Dr Croft paid tribute to Mrs Greaves, who is an evangelist with the Church Army.

He said: ‘Maureen has been very impressive and courageous throughout this week.

‘I spoke to her on Friday morning and she was courageous then but in deep shock.’

After Mr Greaves died, Mrs Greaves, 63,  said she did not seek vengeance.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
