A £60 ($100) smart toothbrush that can tell you if you’ve missed a spot when you brush is set to go on sale this year.

The Kolibree toothbrush is filled with sensors, and uses an app to show people exactly where they have brushed and if they’ve missed a spot.

Its makers boast it will 'tell you whether you brushed long enough and reached the hard-to-reach but important parts of your teeth and gums'.

The Kolibree toothbrush, pictured, is filled with sensors, and uses an app to show people exactly where they have brushed and if they've missed a spot. This smart toothbrush is set to go on sale after April this year.

Users load a special Kolibree app on their phone.

Sensors in the toothbrush can monitor exactly where in the mouth it is, and how much pressure is being used.

The toothbrush sends the data to the app after each brushing, and can tell them if they have missed a spot or not brushed for long enough.

'It connects to your smartphone, and you’ll have an app that tracks the time, and the effectiveness of how you brush - the motion - and how far back in your mouth you get,' Amy Forrester of Kolibree told MailOnline.

'It’s like having a dentist inside your phone.'

The device was unveiled at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, where the world’s electronic manufacturers are meeting this week to unveil their products for the year ahead.

The smart toothbrush sits on a small white charging stand so users don't run out of power, and uses Bluetooth to communicate with a phone.

The app - available on both Android 
and iOS - is able to show a dentist if the user has been brushing 
properly, and owners can even share their daily dental routine with 
friends.

Each brush is given a star rating out of five.

'It’s a really interesting idea - I use a Sonicare brush at the moment, and I presume it’s working, but with this I’d know for sure,' said Stuart Miles of gadget website PocketLint.

'I could even show my dentist my data to see if I’m brushing correctly. The question is whether there’s a big enough market for it.'

Mr Miles predicts 2014 could be the year of the connected gadget.

'I think this year we are going to see more things around the home than ever before get connected online,' he said.

The toothbrush is due to go on sale after April this year.
