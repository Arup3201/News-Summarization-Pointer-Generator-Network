A mass cremation was held today in the Balinese town of Ubud in which more than 60 corpses were burned.

The ceremony, well known as Ngaben, was shared by mourners who could not afford to perform the ritual by themselves.

Ngaben, which means 'turn to ash', is considered to be the last and most important rite in the cycle of a Balinese Hindu life.

60 bodies were burned today in a mass cremation known as Ngaben. The Balinese tradition is believed to release spirits from the burning bodies so they may reincarnate

In Balinese culture, cremation is believed to free spirits from the burning bodies so they may reincarnate or return to heaven.

The corpses are placed in individual coffins and then in sarcophagi made of paper and wood which are burned at the end of a long procession.

Traditionally the procession is not walked in a straight line so as to confuse bad spirits and keep them away from the bodies.

The ritual involves holy songs and offerings, and is considered a joyous occasion for mourners who are releasing their loved ones from the restrictions of worldly life.

Unlike Hinduism in India, the bodies are not cremated immediately after death.

They are typically buried in a funeral and then placed in a temple facing the sea. The corpses are then retrieved three days before the cremation, the date of which is decided upon by the community.

Balinese Hinduism involves three rituals after a person has died, the cremation being the second. After the corpse has been burnt, mourners collect the ashes of bones of the deceased which are offered to the sea in a final ritual

During these three days it is common for the bodies to return to their former homes.

Priests are never buried in this way, but remain in their homes after death until their families have gathered enough money to perform a cremation.

Typically, mourners try not to cry during these ceremonies for fear that they will halt the deceased in their journey to the afterlife.

But some communities believe the shedding of a tear towards the end of the ritual can mean the spirit has completed its journey.

The joyous occasion involves offerings to the dead and celebratory music. Communities perform mass cremations to enjoy the best elements of Ngaben without having to pay for it all themselves

When the fire has burned out, the ashes of bones are separated from the rest of the residue and placed in white and yellow cloth with flowers.

Once the ashes have been collected the 'initial purification' is complete, and the soul is ready for the third stage of ritual which is known as the 'final purification'.

During this ceremony, which usually occurs 12 days after cremation, the ashes that were collected are taken to the sea or a nearby river.

It is believed that once the soul has been purified by fire which represents earth, it must be purified by water so it may return to heaven to begin the process of reincarnation.

According to tradition, the deceased returns to human life in the form of the next born family member after these rituals.
