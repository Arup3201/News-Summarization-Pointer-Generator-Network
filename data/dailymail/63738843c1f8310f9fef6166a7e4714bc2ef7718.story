Sergeant Danny Nightingale in the court martial in Bulford, Wiltshire, where he is on trial charged with possession of a prohibited firearm and possession of 338 rounds of ammunition

An SAS serviceman giving evidence in the trial of sniper Danny Nightingale, claimed soldiers bringing back weapons to the UK as trophies from operations overseas was 'part of the course'.

The special forces man, identified only as Soldier N, described the collecting of weapons from operational tours as 'illegal' but 'semi-okay'.

Soldier N spoke about the gathering of trophy weapons as he gave evidence in the trial of SAS sniper Danny Nightingale, who is accused of having a Glock 9mm pistol and ammunition stored in his bedroom.

He said he had himself brought back a 
Glock 9mm pistol from Iraq, which had been given to him by an Iraqi 
national as a 'gift' in 2003, but would have 'loved' to have obtained a 
sniper’s rifle.

He told the court he was 'not shocked' when he alleged Sergeant Nightingale, 38, told him that he also had a Glock pistol in his possession.

'I know it is illegal but it is kind of part of the course,' Soldier N said.

'You go on operations, you want to bring back a trophy, as our grandfathers did in the war.

'To bring back a trophy of some sort is kind of semi-okay.'

Asked what types of weapons have been brought back from operations overseas, Soldier N replied: 'You only have to look at most sergeants’ messes... AK47s, Dragunovs.

'I’m a sniper and I would love to bring back a Dragunov as a centrepiece.'

The court heard Sergeant Nightingale, 38, (with his wife Sally) had a Glock 9mm pistol stored in his wardrobe and the ammunition stashed under his bed

He described the procedures for checking military equipment coming back into the UK from abroad prior to the Op Plunder directive in 2004 as being 'reasonably relaxed'.

Soldier N, who was best friends with Sgt Nightingale, was sharing a rented house with him when police acting on a tip-off about a gun searched the property in September 2011.

He is currently serving a two-year period of military detention after admitting last year possessing prohibited firearms.

Giving evidence for the Crown, he denied assertions by Sgt Nightingale’s barrister William Clegg QC that the pistol found in his colleague’s bedroom was in fact his.

Mr Clegg asked: 'Was that Glock pistol one that you had ever been in possession of?'

Soldier N replied: 'No.'

Mr Clegg asked Soldier N again: 'Are you quite sure you didn’t bring both pistols back to this country?'

He replied: 'I am positive.'

Mr Clegg said the witness would have received a longer sentence if he had admitted having two pistols.

Soldier N replied: 'I admitted my crime and took it on the chin. One gun, two guns. As far as I was concerned I was in for a long sentence.'

Soldier N, whose evidence was relayed to the public gallery in a neighbouring annexe in order to protect his identity, said he was on deployment in Afghanistan when he was informed police were going to search the house after his ex-wife told them a gun may be stored there.

He described to the court martial board the moment he told Sgt Nightingale that the police were at the house.

'I said: ‘Look mate, I don’t know what is going on. I’m buggered’.'

Soldier N explained that a gun and ammunition had been found among his belongings and claimed Nightingale told him: 'I’ve got the same, mate.'

He told the court that he had a second conversation with Sgt Nightingale - after the defendant had spoken to his superior.

'It was a little bit confusing at first,' Soldier N said.

'He mentioned a Glock pistol. I said "no, no that’s mine". He said "no mate, I have a pistol too".'

Soldier N said Sgt Nightingale did not go into the details of how the Glock came into his possession.

'It was more about the consequences of having it, with a possibility of a five year (prison) term,' he added.

SAS sniper Sergeant Danny Nightingale from Crewe, Cheshire, pictured with wife Sally in March, has pleaded not guilty to a charge of possession of a prohibited firearm, namely a Glock 9mm pistol, between November 26 2007 and September 16 2011

The court has heard that rounds of ammunition were found under Sgt Nightingale’s bed and the pistol was discovered in his wardrobe.

Soldier N said that both he and Sgt Nightingale worked as range instructors and habitually stored ammunition at the rented house rather than checking it back into stores.

'Therefore, I know it’s lazy, however at the end of the day it was easier to drive home ready for the next day rather than going all the way through town etc etc, then vice versa in the morning,' he explained.

Soldier N accepted there had been a 'marked change' in Sgt Nightingale after the illness in the jungle in 2009 but said he did not have memory problems over 'big topics'.

The witness said he and Sgt Nightingale had been best friends but that ended in the wake of the court proceedings when he had declined to provide a statement saying he had moved the defendant’s kit from quarters at their base to the rented house they shared.

Earlier, two former special services colleagues of Sgt Nightingale and Soldier N gave evidence via video link from Afghanistan where they are involved in operations.

Members of the public and media were cleared from the courtroom and listened to the men’s evidence from the annexe but could not see the soldiers. The line was crackly and there was a delay of a few seconds.

Sgt Nightingale, of Crewe, Cheshire, has pleaded not guilty to a charge of possession of a prohibited firearm, namely a Glock 9mm pistol, between November 26 2007 and September 16 2011.

He also denies possession on or about September 16 2011 of ammunition, namely 122 9mm live rounds, 40 7.62mm live rounds, 50 9mm frangible rounds, 50 .338 armour piercing live rounds, two .308 live rounds and 74 5.56mm live rounds.

Sgt Nightingale’s family, including wife Sally and father Humphrey, were in court to support him.

The court martial was adjourned until tomorrow when Sgt Nightingale is expected to give evidence.
