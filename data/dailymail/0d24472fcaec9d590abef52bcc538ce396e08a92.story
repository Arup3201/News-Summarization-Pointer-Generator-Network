They were told their luggage was overweight and faced an extra fee of $130 (£72), so these two passengers on their way to Sydney decided to get creative to get out of paying extra costs.

The duo were flying from Singapore to Sydney when they were told by budget airline Scoot that one of their bags was over the free weight limit.

But instead of protesting, the travellers believed to be from San Fransisco, opened their bags and put on as many of their clothes as possible in a bid to escape financial penalty.

Travellers in Singapore flying to Sydney show off their new trend to avoid being out of pocket $130 (£72) for the excess baggage fee

The cheeky pair sported shoes tucked into
 their pants, jeans tied around their necks, various layers of jocks and
 pants, and even hats piled high on top of each other.

Traveller Stou Sandalski witnessed the unusual ordeal and even snapped a photo of the comical duo decked out in their new attire.

He posted the photo to Reddit where it has since gone viral.

Sandalski said Scoot's airline staff warned the pair at the check-in desk.

'I am going to come to the gate and make sure you are still wearing everything,' a staff member told them.

Daily Mail Australia contacted Scoot who said the baggage policy was at the discretion of ground staff at the time.

Many on social media were quick to jump to the pair's defence.

'Seems
 like a dumb rule. If a couple pounds is an issue why don't they charge 
bigger people more (who only need one seat mind you) and/or smaller 
people less? These airlines... honestly. Doesn't matter if they're still
 wearing everything at the gate - same weight either way,' one Reddit 
user posted.

Another
 user said: 'I did this once, crammed all clothes on me in front of the 
security people (long story short, they were being ridiculously 
unreasonable). They gave me the stink eye but couldn't refuse me 
boarding. Once I entered the lounge I got a round of applauds by the 
people who'd witnessed the whole ordeal'.
