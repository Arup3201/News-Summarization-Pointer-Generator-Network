A landscape gardener has taken drastic measures in his bid to fulfil his new year's resolution to find romance after he hit the streets with a sandwich board declaring: 'Hot brunette wanted for 2014'.

Gerald Abrahams, 39, said he has been walking around the capital with the sign after he 'had enough of internet dating'.

Mr Abrahams, from Chessington, Surrey, said he had received some emails after standing outside Waterloo Station and Piccadilly Circus yesterday, but he had not yet contacted anybody for a date.

Gerald Abrahams has been hitting the streets with a sign featuring the words 'Hot brunette wanted for 2014!' in a bid to find romance

He told the Evening Standard: 'I just needed to do something different for 2014. I’ve had enough of internet dating and thought this would be something light-hearted that people might find amusing and bring a smile to their face.'

He said his perfect woman would be a brunette with brown eyes and she 'must like dogs and landscapers'.

Last week MailOnline reported how, according to research, a 25-year-old Catholic woman who owns a dog, describes herself as thin and drinks alcohol three times a week is more likely to receive the largest number of messages than any other woman on online dating.

Her last relationship would have lasted between three and eight years, according to the analysis.

Likewise, a single Christian, athletic man with brown hair, who publicly states that he wants children, drinks socially and makes between £60,000-£90,000 a year will receive the most number of messages from women.

He would have a masters, law or doctorate degree, and have brown hair.

A team of researchers, including two PHD scientists, examined more than 1.8 million messages sent between heterosexual singles.

Their sample involved more than 81,000 singles between the ages of 25 and 35 in America.

Researchers analysed attributes, demographics, physical traits and length of profiles to identify what makes men and women most desirable on a dating site.
