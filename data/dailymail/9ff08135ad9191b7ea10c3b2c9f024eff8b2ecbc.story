A woman has spoken of the traumatic birth she endured after being turned away by a hospital’s maternity unit - only have the baby 40 minutes later in her mother’s living room.

Zeenat Patel claims she was refused a second labour check by a triage nurse when she called her local hospital.

Miss Patel and her partner, Yaseen Lockhat, first went to the maternity unit at Royal Bolton Hospital about 3.30pm on Thursday, July 3.

Zeenat Patel claims she was repeatedly turned away from her local hospital during labour. Forty minutes after being sent home again she gave birth to baby Liyana in her mother's living room

She claims a triage nurse told her she was not in 'active' labour and advised her to go home until the contractions became more frequent.

But an hour after the couple left, Miss Patel, 26, found herself in constant pain and called the maternity triage nurse at 5.50pm - and was told again to wait at home.

Concerned their baby was just minutes away from being born, the couple drove back to the hospital. off for the hospital again by car.

Miss Patel said: 'My labour pains were getting a lot stronger and I just knew the baby was going to come soon.

'By the time I had explained this over the phone, got cut off and got back through again, we were outside the hospital doors.

'I was told that because I was talking between contractions I couldn’t be that close, but I was in pain all the time.

'They spoke to me like I was a child, like I didn’t know my own body.

'I’d given birth before and I knew what was happening, but they wouldn't listen. We were left with no alternative but to go home.'

But as soon as Mr Lockhat dropped her off at her mother’s house, she started to give birth.

Miss Patel's mother, Hanifa, delivered the baby herself on the living room floor with the aid of an ambulance call-handler

'I shut myself in the toilet and when I sat down I could feel the head,' she recalled.

'All I could do was push. I kept thinking if they had checked me, I wouldn’t be giving birth in this situation.

'I stayed in the toilet because I didn’t want my three- year-old daughter, Jasmine, to see what was happening.

'Giving birth is meant to be a special experience, but this was just traumatic.'

When her mother, Hanifa, heard her daughter scream in the toilet and saw the baby’s head, she dialled 999.

Mrs Patel managed to help her daughter to the living room where she delivered the baby herself at 6.30pm, with the aid of an ambulance call-handler.

Mrs Patel, 54, said: 'It all happened so quickly. It was very scary. I grabbed some towels and managed to lie her down in the living room.

'It was very difficult because I had to hold the phone and catch the baby as she was born.'

Baby Liyana came out with the cord around her neck but is now doing well

To make matters worse, baby Liyana came out with the cord around her neck. 

Mrs Patel added: 'My mother was a midwife so I remembered some of the things she had told me.

Paramedics arrived 25 minutes after baby Liyana was born - weighing 6lb 2oz -  and took mother and daughter to hospital. 

Miss Patel said: 'I was so grateful my mum was there - I don’t know what I would have done without her.

'All I want to know is how and why this was allowed to happen. Imagine if it had been someone who didn’t have her family around her.'

Sue Anderton, head of midwifery at the hospital, said: 'A senior matron met with Zeenat and her family as soon as we heard of these concerns and I followed this up and went to meet them myself.

'Clearly they are very upset and we will look into what happened thoroughly and get back to them.'
