A British soldier has died in a rafting accident during training in Austria after reportedly being swept away when his boat capsized.

Austrian police said the 22-year-old man was one of a group of British Army servicemen based in Germany who went on the trip.

They believe eight people set off on the raft from Landeck in Tirol, western Austria, yesterday.

It is understood to have overturned shortly after departure along the Inn River near 
Fliess.

Eyewitnesses said the man, who has not been named but was with 2 Logistic Support Regiment, lost his grip on the boat after it capsized and he and his colleagues tried to upright it.

But the water current was reported to be too strong and he was 
swept downstream, according to the Austrian Times.

Investigators are expected to look at whether the raft trip should have gone ahead due to the torrential rain that has fallen in Austria in recent days.

A spokesman for the Ministry of Defence today confirmed the man's death.

He told MailOnline: 'It is with regret that the Ministry of Defence can confirm the death of a serving soldier from 2 Logistic Support Regiment (2 LSR) yesterday.

'The circumstances of the soldierâ€™s death are being investigated by the Austrian police and we are supporting them with the work.'

The spokesman said the trip was organised as an 'adventurous training' activity, which is provided to all armed forces personnel.

The Austrian Times reported that the man was recovered from the water but attempts
to resuscitate him failed.

His boat was the last of three that set off and was reportedly 'hit by a huge wave shortly before it turned over'.

According to the British Army website, soldiers from 2 LSR have in recent years been deployed to countries including Bosnia, Kosovo, Northern Ireland, Kenya and the Falkland Islands.

In January this year, Her Royal Highness Princess Anne, The Princess Royal, presented personnel from 2 LSR with campaign medals following their return from a 'demanding' tour in Afghanistan.

Princess Anne, who is the 
Colonel-in-Chief of the Royal Logistic Corps, presented medals to 2 LSR 
during a ceremony at Princess Royal Barracks in northern Germany.

During their tour, between March and November 2011, soldiers were deployed across the volatile Helmand Province in support of Germany-based 20th Armoured Brigade.

They provided transport and communications expertise and worked with the Afghan National Army to prepare them to take over security for the country.
