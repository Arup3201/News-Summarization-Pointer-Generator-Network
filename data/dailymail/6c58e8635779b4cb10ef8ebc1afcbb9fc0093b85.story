The Obama administration told law enforcement to 'stand down' and not arrest Occupy Wall Street protesters even though some may have broken the law, newly-obtained documents have revealed.

Emails show the General Services Administration told authorities in Portland, Oregon not to enforce curfews on protesters camped out on federal property, on the orders of the White House.

This relaxed approach will likely raise concerns over the government's willingness to protect its workers or punish the anti-capitalist movement's wrong-doers.

Relaxed: Emails have revealed the White House told law enforcement officials in Portland, Oregon (pictured) to 'stand down' and not arrest Occupy protesters on federal-owned property last year

The correspondence between Robert Peck, the federal agency's former commissioner, and a senior official from the Department of Homeland Security were obtained by the conservative watchdog, JudicialWatch.org.

In one email sent on November 6, 2011, officials from the two agencies discussed a group of 11 protesters who had camped out at Terry Schrunk Plaza, a downtown park.

'They have chained themselves to a large drum filled with concrete,' Caitlin Durkovich, chief of staff at the Department of Homeland Security/National Protection and Programs Directorate wrote.

'GSA controls the permits and has asked [Federal Protective Services] not to enforce the curfew at park and the prohibition on overnight encampments.

Questions: An email dated November 6, 2011 from a Department of Homeland Security official asks for confirmation they are 'standing down'. Thh emails were obtained by JudicialWatch.org

Response: Robert Peck, the former commissioner for Public Buildings Services for the government agency, writes that it is the White House's request that the protesters are not arrested

'Our FPS Commander in Portland says they are standing down and following GSA's request to only intervene if there is a threat to public safety.'

Peck, the recipient of the email, replied: 'Caitlin: yes, that is our position; it's been vetted with our administrator and Michael Robertson, our chief of staff, and we have communicated with the WH [White House], which has afforded us the discretion to fashion our approach to Occupy issues.

'The arrests last week were carried out despite our request that the protesters be allowed to remain and to camp overnight.'

The emails come several days after the start of protests on GSA-owned property; a week before, Portland police, some wearing riot gear, had arrested 25 protestors.

Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton said the emails show the White House was protecting Occupy protesters, Fox News reported.

Messenger: Peck, left, claimed he was passing on orders from President Obama's White House

'These documents clearly show that 
federal agencies colluded with the Obama White House to allow the Occupy
 Wall Street protesters to violate the law with impunity,' he said.

'These documents tell us that the GSA and DHS can't be relied upon to protect federal workers or property.'

A spokeswoman for the GSA told Fox in
 a written statement: 'The General Services Administration worked 
closely with the Portland Police Bureau and the Federal Protective 
Service (FPS) in maintaining the health and safety of the general 
public, protesters and federal employees during last year's Portland 
Occupy protests.

'However FPS and local law enforcement had the best 
understanding of the situation on the ground in Terry Schrunk Park, and 
determined the necessary action.'

Asked if she was specifically saying Peck was in error, spokesperson Mafara Hobson told The Washington Examiner:
 'Yes, I'm saying that the decisions that were made were based on the 
judgment of the law enforcement folks on the ground ONLY. He's not 
correct.'

Clashes: Despite requests to 'go easy' on protesters, there were still numerous clashes, with riot gear-clad police using pepper spray (pictured) and arresting more than 180 people in total at Portland

Shutting down: The tents in Portland were finally cleared on November 13, but the movement continues

Peck resigned in April this year following reports over his agency's excessive spending at a training conference, which featured a mindreader, a clown and a comedian.

The Occupy Wall Street movement spread across the United States last year after beginning in the financial district of Manhattan in September following the protests from the Arab Spring.

Despite the White House's reported desire for officials to 'go easy' on protesters, some of the most violent Occupy clashes occurred in Portland and a total of 184 people have been arrested there in conjunction with the movement, according to OccupyArrests.com.

The camp was eventually dismantled on November 13 but the group still plans and carries out acts of civil disobedience, including a picket that shut down the port in December.
