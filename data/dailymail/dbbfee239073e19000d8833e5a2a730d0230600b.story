New rates: Chancellor George Osborne announced changes to the current tax credit system, which was introduced in 2003, in his Autumn Statement

A promise by the Tories to ensure all policies are family-friendly has been broken by making the ‘couples penalty’ worse, campaigners said last night.

The current tax credits system, introduced by Labour in 2003, can encourage parents to live apart, or pretend to do so, because they can claim more credits if they do.

But new rates of the benefit for next year, announced by George Osborne in the Autumn Statement, will actually increase the size of this penalty for many couples, according to the Marriage Foundation.

It said couples with one child who stay together now will not be eligible for up to £7,295 a year – a rise of £80. 

And a mother working more than 40 hours a week could miss out on as much as £11,059 if she has three or four children.

Harry Benson, of the think-tank, said this penalty threatened family stability and encourages fraud. 

He added that it failed the Government’s ‘family test’, a promise announced in October to put the family at the heart of all policies.

The foundation last year found there were 240,000 more claimants of lone parent tax credits than there were lone parents.  

Mr Benson’s new analysis, on the changes following the Autumn Statement, show that the new rates mean the couple penalty has got worse for certain groups.

Couples with one child who stay together lose out on as much as £7,295 a year.

The losses are particularly high if the mother works for more than 40 hours a week. In that scenario, she could lose as much as £11,059 if she has three or four children.

Mr Benson said: ‘The introduction of tax credits in 2003 brought with it the perverse side-effect of paying thousands of pounds more to couples who live apart than together.

‘As well as discouraging couple formation, this “couple penalty” also discourages the formal commitment of marriage, thereby threatening family stability.

‘The “couple penalty”’ encourages fraud. Official figures show that at least half a million people are pretending to live apart.

‘For most typical scenarios, the ‘couple penalty’ has risen consistently under both Labour and Coalition governments.’

Broken promises: Marriage Foundation, a think-tank, said that the new tax credit plans failed the David Cameron's ‘family test’, a pledge announced in October to put the family at the heart of all policies

He added: ‘The Prime Minister’s new family test requires all policy to be scrutinised for its impact on the family. In his announcement, Mr Cameron specifically mentioned the incentive to live apart.

‘New rates of tax credit for 2015/16 mean that the “couple penalty” will actually increase under different scenarios.

‘This policy fails – or falls well short of – three of the five points in the “family test”. It negatively influences family formation, transitions to parenthood and marriage, and deters couples from reducing their risk by getting married.’
