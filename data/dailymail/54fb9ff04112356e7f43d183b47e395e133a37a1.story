Immigration minister Mark Harper said measures have been put in place to prevent the error from happening again

The personal details of 1,600 illegal immigrants have been published in online in a Home Office blunder.

The names, dates of birth and immigration status of 1,598 immigrants involved with the family returns process were revealed on the government’s website.

In a written statement to Parliament, 
immigration minister Mark Harper said measures have been put in place to
prevent the error from happening again.

Labour condemned the ‘staggering level of incompetence‘ at the Home Office after the data was left on public view for almost two weeks.

The Information Commissioner has been called in to examine the data breach and the Home Office has ordered an internal investigation.

The details were available in error between October 15 and October 28 and were taken down by department officials when the mistake was identified.

The information did not include personal addresses or financial information.

Fewer than 30 visits were made to the relevant webpage and the Home Office believes the risk to those whose personal information was accessible for the period is ‘low’.

But chair of the Home Affairs Select Committee Keith Vaz said he was ‘appalled at this serious breach of personal data’.

He said: ‘This breach yet again raises serious questions about the departments' ability to function adequately.

‘The Home Affairs Committee recently scolded the Home Office for taking months to reply to our correspondence, yet it seems in just seconds they were able to release this private data.

‘We will be seeking assurances from the Home Office that they are looking carefully at their reporting systems. They must ensure that this does not happen again.’

The family returns process deals with immigrants who have been found to have no right to be in the UK.

Among other measures, the process involves helping families return home through conferences, providing notice to families who are required to leave and dealing with those who refuse to depart the UK.

Shadow immigration minister David Hanson said: ‘It is a staggering level of incompetence in the Home Office that has let the personal data of nearly 1,600 people be put on the internet for anyone to download, and yet again shows just how chaotic the Home Office is under this Government.

‘People need to be able to trust the Home Office to process their immigration applications efficiently and confidentially but this huge breach of data security seriously undermines that.

‘Ministers need to provide answers about how this was able to happen and whether people's data is still at risk, and Theresa May needs to take urgent action to stop the incompetence on her watch.’
