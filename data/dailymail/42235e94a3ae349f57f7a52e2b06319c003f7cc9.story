A father who allegedly abandoned his two children in the wreckage of a car crash after they were seriously injured, has been arrested by police.

Detectives believe Umbar Ali was driving a Vauxhall Zafira, which was involved in a collision with an Alfa Romeo in Bradford, West Yorkshire on Saturday night.

Two children, aged two and four, were discovered by police officers in the Zafira alone.

They were taken to hospital with serious injuries.

Accident: Two children, aged two and four, were left in the wreckage of a Vauxhall Zafira following a crash in Manningham, Bradford. Police investigating launched a hunt for Umbar Ali, 39, believed to be the father of the children and driver of the Zafira, who allegedly fled the scene

Officers believe Ali, 39, from Bradford is the father of the youngsters.

The accident happened in Queen's Road at the junction with Valley Road, Manningham, at around 9.30pm.

Ali is thought to have fled the scene, sparking a manhunt.

A spokesman for West Yorkshire Police said: 'We can confirm a 39-year-old man has been arrested in connection with the incident.'

He said the man has been detained on suspicion of failing to stop at the scene of an accident.

Officers had been concerned that Ali may have been injured in the accident and could require treatment in hospital.

Two people in the Alfa Romeo, aged 34 and 32, were freed from the vehicle by firefighters and taken to hospital with suspected spinal injuries and a broken collar bone.

A fire service spokesman described the collision as a 'fairly high-speed impact'.

One woman is understood to have suffered a broken collarbone in the accident.

Firefighters called to the scene of the crash, cut the roof from the Alfa Romeo to free the female passenger and male driver.

A fire service spokesman said the man was suffering from suspected spinal injuries.

The road was closed for about three hours after the crash.

Inspector Joanne Field, of West Yorkshire Police's Western Area Roads Policing Unit, has urged anyone with information to contact the unit on 101 or Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
