Erik Lamela has been making the most of his time off by getting himself fit for the new Premier League season with Tottenham.

The 22-year-old wasn't selected in Argentina's 2014 World Cup squad after a difficult first campain with the north London club.

Lamela seems to be looking forward to the new season though as he took to Twitter to show off a gym workout while writing, 'come on you Spurs!'.

New Spurs boss Mauricio Pochettino will be hoping to get the former Roma forward back on track this season after injuries plagued his debut season in England.

Pochettino left Southampton to sign a five-year contract with Spurs in the summer as the club decided not to continue with Tim Sherwood as their manager.
