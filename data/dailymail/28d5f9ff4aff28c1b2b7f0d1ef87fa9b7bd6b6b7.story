Final: Germany vs Argentina

Venue: Estadio do Maracana, Rio De Janeiro

Kick-off: 8pm (4pm, Brazil time)

TV coverage: BBC1 and ITV1, from 7pm

Odds: Germany 13/10 Draw 11/5 Argentina 12/5

Joachim Low (Germany)Alejandro Sabella (Argentina)

Team talk: Germany head coach Joachim Low talks to his players ahead of the World Cup final

Team news: Germany defender Mats Hummels is expected to be available for selection despite missing the second half against Brazil as a precaution because of tendonitis.

Argentina winger Angel Di Maria is a doubt after pulling out of training on Saturday with a suspected thigh injury.

Striker Sergio Aguero has fully recovered from a muscle strain and could replace Ezequiel Lavezzi or Gonzalo Higuain.

Left-back Marcos Rojo did not complete training on Friday due to a sore ankle but he should be fine for the final.

Key clash: Toni Kroos (Germany) v Javier Mascherano (Argentina)

Two Golden Ball nominees come face-to-face here and Mascherano must ensure Kroos cannot keep Germany ticking. This game could be decided by just one goal with La Albiceleste’s talisman Lionel Messi unlikely to get much space - so Argentina’s defence, which has not conceded since the group stage, will be vital.

Opta stats:

They have won just one of their last four appearances in the World Cup final (1990 v Argentina).

Record breaker: Germany's Miroslav Klose has scored more World Cup goals than any other player in history

Star man: Argentina's Lionel Messi (centre) controls the ball as he prepares for the World Cup final

The last time Germany scored in a World Cup match and lost was the 1994 quarter final defeat to Bulgaria (1-2).

Germany are unbeaten in 17 internationals (W12, D5).

Argentina haven't been trailing in any of their six games at the 2014 World Cup, Germany just eight minutes (v Ghana).

Argentina have won four out of five penalty shootouts at the World Cup, Germany won four out of four (including the one against Argentina in 2006).

Miroslav Klose has scored more World Cup goals than any other player in history and as many as the entire current Argentinian squad (16).

Only Lothar Matthäus (25) has played more World Cup games than Klose (23, as many as Paolo Maldini).

Klose is the only player in both squads who has already played in a World Cup final (2002, 0-2 v Brazil).

Argentina's Angel di Maria and Marcos Rojo lead the way in terms of crosses attempted from open play, with Rojo's haul of 25 so far bettered only by team-mate di Maria (32).

Thomas Müller has played a hand in 16 World Cup goals in 12 appearances at the finals (10 goals and six assists).

Müller (2010 and 2014) and Klose (2002 and 2006) are the only players in history to score 5+ goals at consecutive World Cup tournaments.

Eye on the ball: Germany's Thomas Muller trains at Estadio Vasco da Gama on Saturday

Müller is the first-ever Golden Boot winner to reproduce his number of goals at the following World Cup (five goals in 2010, five in 2014).

Müller could also become the first player ever to win the Golden Boot at successive World Cups.

Lionel Messi has been the most creative player at World Cup 2014, setting up a tournament-high 21 goal-scoring chances for team-mates.

Messi has embarked on a tournament-high 65 dribbles so far, completing (another-high) 39 of them.

No German player has created more chances for their teammates in the 2014 World Cup than Mesut Özil (15).

Barcelona midfielder Javier Mascherano has attempted a competition-high 509 passes so far.

Mascherano has also made the most tackles so far - 28.

Andre Schürrle has scored three times in just 156 minutes of action so far at this World Cup.

Only Tim Howard (27) has made more saves in the competition than Manuel Neuer (23).

Lionel Messi has scored five World Cup goals to date, but none of them in the knockout stages.

Angel di Maria or Sami Khedira will become the 10th player to win both the Champions League and the World Cup in the same season. Seven of the previous nine have been German (Bayern Munich 1974) along with Christian Karembeu in 1998 and Roberto Carlos in 2002.
