Accused: Catherine Kieu is alleged to have cut off her husband's penis and then dialled the emergency services

A woman accused of drugging her husband before cutting off his penis with a kitchen knife and grinding it up in a garbage disposal after a row over house guests faces life in prison.

Catherine Kieu, 48, is said to have made her 60-year-old husband dinner at their California home on Monday night and put an unknown poison or drug in the food to make him pass out.

When he woke up, he was tied to a bed and could not move while his wife took a 10 inch knife to his genitalia before throwing the organ into the garbage disposal and turning it on, police said.

Prosecutors said that incident followed an argument over friends staying at the house.

The couple, who married in late 2009, were involved in divorce proceedings.

Kieu, who works as a real estate broker, rang 911. She told officers who found her husband tied to the bed and bleeding from the groin that he 'deserved it'.

The man was rushed to the University of 
California-Irvine Medical Center in Orange where he underwent emergency 
surgery. The severed organ could not be reattached.

Behind bars: Kieu faces life in prison if found guilty and given the maximum sentence

Kieu, who was initially identified as Catherine Kieu Becker, appeared in court yesterday charged with one count each of 
torture and aggravated mayhem, with sentencing enhancements for causing 
great bodily injury and using a knife.

During a brief court appearance, in which she hid her face behind her dark hair, she was told she faces a maximum sentence of life in prison without the possibility of parole if convicted.

Authorities were called to the 
couple's home in Garden Grove, just south of Los Angeles, after Kieu 
called 911 reporting a medical emergency.

The husband told police she served 
him dinner and he went to bed around 9pm after feeling tired.

While 
he was sleeping, Kieu 'tied the victim’s legs and arms to the four 
corners of the bed with nylon ropes', prosecutors said.

The victim told authorities that when
he woke up, Kieu pulled his pants 'grabbing the victim’s penis and 
severing it with a knife'.

Kieu then took the penis to the kitchen and 
threw it in the garbage disposal, 'turning it on, and mutilating the 
organ'.
