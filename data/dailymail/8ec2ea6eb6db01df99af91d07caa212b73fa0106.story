The world gets a first proper look at Apple’s latest gadget tonight when the company launches its first smartwatch.

With a price tag of about £220, the Apple Watch boasts a range of lifestyle functions – promising to open your car door, buy a coffee and even track your heart rate.

The company hopes it will have a winner on its hands, even though sales of rival products by Samsung, LG and Sony have been sluggish and many smartwatches have a notoriously short battery life.

Apple's latest gadget - the Apple Watch - will be unveiled on Monday night and comes with a price tag of £220

However, Apple and its British design guru, Sir Jonathan Ive, plan to make the firm’s watch a lifestyle essential.

Partnerships have been signed with car companies like BMW, which will allow users to open the vehicle door through the watch.

It can also be paired with technology in the home and in hotel chain rooms to automatically let the user in without a key or smart card.

There will be partnerships with airlines that will see the watch double as a boarding pass to allow users to sweep through airports more quickly.

Importantly, it will be loaded with the new ‘Apple Pay’ technology, that will allow users to pay for a raft of purchases by waving the watch over a till point scanner.

The system, which is tied in to user bank accounts, means people will buy lunch or pay for a train or bus ride without the need for cash.

The watch, which will be linked to the owner’s iPhone via a Bluetooth link, will also provide a map and directions, vibrating on the wrist to warn of the need to make a turn.

The first details of the watch were revealed by Apple chief executive, Tim Cook, in September last year

Importantly, it will also include a raft of health sensors and trackers, which will measure the heart rate and activity level as part of a program to boost fitness.

When the first details of the watch were revealed last September, chief executive, Tim Cook, said: ‘We love to make great products that enrich people’s lives. We love to make technology more personal and allow our users to do things they never imagined.

‘We believe this new product will redefine what people expect from this category. This is the next chapter in Apple’s story.

‘It is the most personal watch ever created. It is incredibly customisable to find one that reflects your personal style and taste. It is also a comprehensive health and fitness device.

‘Being more active is being one of the best things you can do to improve your health. Apple Watch gives the ability to motivate people to be more active...or track what you are doing during the day.’

While the watch will have a starting price of around £220 it is suggested there will be a host of other premium versions, including one in gold that will cost as much as £3,325.

As such, the company are presenting the device, which was created with input from Paul Deneve, the former chief executive of the fashion house Yves Saint Laurent, as very much a fashion item.

The first version, which was unveiled in the autumn, featured a square steel and glass device with a range of case designs, digital watch faces and straps, some leather, some sporty, and one stainless steel to reflect the style of the wearer.

It is controlled via a button on the side, which is called a ‘digital crown’ and looks much like the winder on a traditional watch.

Sir Jonathan said: ‘Creating beautiful objects that are simple, pure and functional has always been our goal. We have designed a range of products so personal that you wear them on your wrist.’

Ernest Doku, technology expert at uSwitch.com, said: ‘Apple’s long-awaited entry to the wearables space will no doubt supercharge a market that otherwise seemed destined to be the preserve of techies and early adopters.’

The Apple Watch boasts a range of lifestyle functions including the 'Apple Play' software, which will allow users to avoid the need to use cash by simply waving the watch over a till point scanner

The latest speculation suggests that Apple is worried about battery life on the Watch - a common issue among existing smartwatches. 

Smartphone users already struggle with the relatively short battery life and adding the need to charge a new device will put some people off the whole idea.

Mr Doku said: ’The reveal will hopefully give us greater insight into how this device will benefit our lives with a selection of dedicated app demos, a more finalised look at the software and user interface as well as those all-important price points - we entirely expect Apple’s premium positioning to continue in the wearables arena.’
