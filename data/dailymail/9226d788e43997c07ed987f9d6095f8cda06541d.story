World boxing champion Kell Brook is in hospital in Tenerife after being stabbed in the leg on Thursday during an altercation while on holiday.

The 28-year-old, who won the IBF welterweight title last month, is not believed to be in a life-threatening condition, though Spanish police claim ‘he lost a lot of blood’ from multiple wounds in his left leg and also suffered defence injuries to his arm in the 6am incident.

Onlookers at the scene, close to the Golf De Sur resort in southern Tenerife, have described a trail of blood from an apartment at the Las Adelfas complex, to a second apartment where Brook is understood to have attempted to gain entry by smashing a patio window.

Kell Brook's career-defining victory over Shawn Porter in Los Angeles last month finally proved what he'd always insisted, that he could mix it with the worlds best.

The Sheffield star had won 32 fights as a professional before earning his shot at the IBF welterweight title, a journey that had more than it's fair share of roadblocks.

Brook was the mandatory challenger to the great Manny Pacquiao as far back as 2010 but instead had to bide his time. A switch to promoter Eddie Hearn saw an upturn in his fortunes as he progressed from fighting in leisure centres to filling out arenas.

Victory over Hector Saldivia two years ago manoeuvred him into position to fight then champion Devon Alexander but injuries to both men saw the fight postponed three times and eventually cancelled.

Instead, he faced the undefeated Porter, outpointing the champion to become the sixth Brit to hold a world title in the division and the first since Ricky Hatton's brief stint in 2006.

That victory should catapult him into the realm of mega-fights with a domestic dust-up with bitter British rival Amir Khan on the cards for next year.

Sportsmail has been told by a local source that concerned residents then contacted security and Brook was taken by ambulance to Candelaria hospital in Santa Cruz.

Brook is understood to have been on a night out in Golf De Sur with his heavily pregnant partner, Lindsey, who left early and was not present when the altercation occurred.

Brook is said to have met up with mutual friends after parting company with his girlfriend, before heading back to Las Adelfas in the early hours. It is believed he had spent time with his attacker.

A Spanish police spokesman said: ‘This morning a 28-year-old British man was stabbed in the left leg and is hospitalised.

He lost a lot of blood. There are no arrests at this time.’

The Sheffield fighter’s promoter Eddie Hearn, who had been in talks to make a blockbuster showdown with Amir Khan at Wembley next May, was on Thursday night planning to fly to Tenerife to check on Brook’s condition.

Hearn told Sportsmail: ‘We are all worried about what has happened and we have not been able to speak to Kell. I am told he is stable.’

Brook’s next fight, scheduled for December 6 in Sheffield, is now a major doubt.

It is the second time Brook has been stabbed, having also been attacked in his hometown of Sheffield in 2007.

He was leaving the Cactus Club, in Earsham Street, when he was stabbed in the side and buttocks.

Brook returned to fight six months later and has since amassed a perfect record of 33 fights and 33 wins.

He clinched the IBF world welterweight title 20 days ago with a points victory over 26-year-old American Shawn Porter in California.

Hearn failed with a previous £3million offer to Khan to fight Brook, but the Sheffield fighter has become a far more attractive opponent to Khan since beating Porter. 

Hearn had written in his MailOnline column this week that negotiations could be concluded within a month.  

'Talks are ongoing over a fight between Kell Brook and Amir Khan. It is going well because I think everyone realises it makes sense,' wrote Hearn. 

'Khan obviously wants a fight with Floyd Mayweather, as does everyone in the division, but he knows that while that fight might never happen, even if it did he would make more money fighting Kell.

‘Everything so far has been very straightforward and I am in talks with Wembley over a May date. They want us back there as soon as possible after the success of Froch-Groves – I have no doubt in my mind that we would fill that stadium again. I hope to have this tied up in the next month or so.’
