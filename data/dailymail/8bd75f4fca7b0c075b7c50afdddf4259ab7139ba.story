A woman is on a mission to smash the 'bogan' stigma that plagues the Queensland city where she lives by creating a nostalgic Facebook campaign.

The city of Logan, south of Brisbane, is often criticised for housing too many bogan residents and has a bad reputation for crime.

The 'Gotta Love Logan' Facebook page is Kathleen de Leon's attempt to instill pride in Logan residents and prove they aren't bogans.

'I started to get a bit weary of all the negative things. People keep trying to tell us we're a bad place and we're not,' Ms de Leon told Quest Logan News.

'I thought it was about time people hear about the positive side of our city.

'I want to show people what we have to be proud of from the past, present and in the future.'

The Gotta Love Logan page has more than 1700 likes since Ms de Leon started it last year and hundreds of Logan residents contribute to the page

Wild Waters was a popular attraction in Logan operating from 1982-84. The land currently houses the largest shopping centre in Logan, the  Hyperdome

Queensland Premier Campbell Newman came under fire last month for calling people in the area 'the bogans who lives in Logan'.

The comment was made during a parliament sitting when Mr Newman interrupted a speech from one of his colleagues to refer to the people from Logan by the offensive term.

He later said his comments had been taken out of context, insisting he made the comments in reference to how he thought the people of Logan were perceived by Federal MP Clive Palmer and the Palmer United member for Gaven, Alex Douglas.

One of Australia's most iconic bogans, Reg Reagan, was a persona adopted by former NRL star Matthew Johns for The Footy Show.

His attire of football shorts, a flannelet shirt and thongs is the clothing choice people most often associate with bogans.

The Gotta Love Logan page has more than 1700 likes since Ms de Leon started it last year.

Hundreds of residents have contributed historic photos of old water attractions, gardens, pools and shopping centres.

The nostalgic photos have mostly formed a platform for people to look back on memories, but Ms de Leon said the Facebook campaign was to make residents fall back in love with Logan.

Oasis Gardens was a popular spot for locals and featured eight acres of lawns and subtropical gardens, three swimming pools, a children's wading pool and playground

The property where Oasis Garden sat now houses several homes in an exclusive estate

Apart from the gardens and pools, Oasis Gardens attracted people for the kangaroos, koalas and parrots spotted in the area
