In a brief statement issued through his Dublin-based communications consultants, the golfer said he was making the announcement publicly after talking to Wozniacki.

'The problem is mine,' he said.

'The wedding invitations issued at the weekend made me realise that I wasn't ready for all that marriage entails.

'I wish Caroline all the happiness she deserves and thank her for the great times we've had. I will not be saying anything more about our relationship in any setting.'

The golden couple of sport enjoyed a short-lived engagement after announcing to their million plus Twitter followers last new year's eve that they were to marry.

At the time the pair posted matching pictures of themselves with a ring.

It is 
understood the couple - dubbed Wozzilroy in some circles after a golf 
wedge was engraved with the moniker - had been an item for more than two
 years.

As recently as Sunday, McIlroy's Twitter feed suggested there were no signs of trouble in the relationship after he posted a picture from Nobu restaurant in Monte Carlo where the pair had dinner.

McIlroy is involved in a lengthy legal battle with his former management company in the courts in Dublin over commissions from his lucrative sports sponsorship and endorsement contracts.

The golf star, who has a $20m-a-year contract with Nike, claims he has paid more than $6.8m based on unreasonable fee rates much higher than the norm in the sports agency industry.
