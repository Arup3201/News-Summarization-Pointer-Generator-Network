The New York City schoolboy who gained overnight fame after telling a reporter he had made $72million trading stocks on his lunch breaks has claimed he made it all up.

Mohammed Islam, 17, who said he had made millions of dollars by trading oil and gold futures and equities, has now hired a pricey crisis PR firm and battle-tested attorneys to spread the word.

The Stuyvesant High School student was surrounded by his new entourage when he came clean to the New York Observer on Monday after his little fib turned into a major international news story.

It comes as New York Magazine, which ran the original interview with Islam, including his estimated $72million fortune, has admitted it was 'duped' by the teenager and apologized to its readers.

Not a multi-millionaire: Mohammed Islam, 17, from Queens, New York made international headlines after a New York Magazine article said he had made millions on the stock market. Now, Islam says the claims aren't true

Apology: New York Magazine today admitted it was 'duped' by the teenager and apologized to its readers

In a statement, the magazine, whose reporter Jessica Pressler initially insisted she was shown bank statements showing he is worth eight figures, said: 'As part of the research process, the magazine sent a fact-checker to Stuyvesant, where Islam produced a document that appeared to be a Chase bank statement attesting to an eight-figure bank account. 

'After the story's publication, people questioned the $72 million figure in the headline, which was written by editors based on the rumored figure. The headline was amended.

'But in an interview with the New YorkObserver last night, Islam now says his entire story was made up. A source close to the Islam family told the Washington Post that the statements were falsified.'

It concluded: 'We were duped. Our fact-checking process was obviously inadequate; we take full responsibility and we should have known better. New York apologizes to our readers.'

Far from his original claims, Islam, president of the prestigious high school's investment club, now says he traded only using simulated money he made using an online trading program.

Eight figures? The writer of the article, Jessica Pressler, has come under fire for failing to fact check, but she insisted she saw bank statements backing up rumors Islam was worth 'eight figures'

The Queens teen told the Observer that not only was the $72 million totally false, but he's never made any money in the stock market at all.

'[I led her to believe] I had made even more than $72 million on the simulated trades,' he told the Observer.

A firestorm of criticism was unleashed in the wake of Islam's retraction on New York Magazine and the original article's author Jessica Pressler.

Detractors say the writer failed to do appropriate fact checking for her article. 

The Observer's Ken Kurson writes: 

'Even if this working-class kid had somehow started with $100,000 as a high school freshman on day one at Stuy High, he’d have needed to average a compounded annualized return of something like 796% over the three years since. C’mon, man.'

Helaine Olen of the Pacific Standard took to Twitter, as many did Monday, to demand that Pressler come up with some answers to how she and her publication managed to pass off the seeming impossibility as fact.

'OK. Here goes ... did he show statements? I have a 15 yr old so I want to believe,' Olen tweeted.

Pressler responded to the criticism through Twitter on Monday morning. 

'We saw a bank statement confirming the eight figures, & I'm comfortable with what's in the piece,' she wrote.

In the wake of the controversy New York Magazine added an editor's note to qualify their now contentious article - which was later edited to include the full apology. 

'Our story portrays the $72 million figure as a rumor; the initial headline has been changed to more clearly reflect the fact that we did not know the exact figure he has made in trades,' the note said.

'However, Mohammed provided bank statements that showed he is worth eight figures, and he confirmed on the record that he’s worth eight figures.'

So, as the Observer and everyone else wants to know: where did Pressler come up with the $72 million figure? In Islam's own words, 'The number’s a rumor.'

Indeed, Pressler does not state the $72 million figure as fact in her original article. 

Regardless, NYmag.com has since changed the original headline so as not to reflect that number.

However, the online bickering began when the  New York Post picked up the story and ran it as fact with the breathless headline, 'High school student scores $72M playing the stock market.'

'A thing that I have learned today is that @nypost still drives a remarkable amount of international news coverage,' Pressler would tweet Monday.

Talking the talk: Islam (pictured giving a high school TED talk) told the Observer he's actually never made any money in the stock market at all

Fighting back: Pressler says she saw statements backing up the rumors about Islam's wealth, but he says they were only rumors and he's never even traded a stock

The house of cards has since fallen for Islam, too, of course. He was due to appear on CNBC on Monday morning to talk about his fantastical skills on the stock market. 

In light of his new found infamy and no doubt counseled by his new advisers, that slot was canceled.

And as a teenager, Islam still has to face his disapproving parents when he goes home.

'My mom basically said she’d never talk to me. Their morals are that if I lie about it and don’t own up to it then they can no longer trust me,' he said in his interview with the Observer. 'They knew it was false and they basically wanted to kill me and I haven’t spoken to them since.'
