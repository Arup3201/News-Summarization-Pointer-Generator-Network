It all ended in smiles, but when Sydney Sixers opener Riki Wessels was cracked in the head by a 144.7 km/h delivery in his side’s Big Bash match there was a sharp intake of breath all around the Adelaide Oval.

The tragic death of Australian batsman Philip Hughes last November when he was struck in the head by a similar ball from fast bowler Sean Abbott is still fresh in the memory, and since then there has been a lot of debate and controversy over the kind of helmets being used today.

In this instance Wessels’ helmet did its job. The 29-year-old was struck on Saturday night by a bouncer from Adelaide paceman Kane Richardson in the fourth over with the ball getting lodged between the peak of his helmet and the protective face grill.

Wessels kissed his helmet in relief immediately afterwards and he was only half joking when he did it. Richardson’s 144.7 km/h delivery was pitched straight at him and the ball was heading directly for his forehead.

Only the protective grill saved him from serious injury, so it was no wonder he was thankful.

Wessels had even more reason to be grateful as he came in for more punishment just a few overs later when he was struck again on the helmet by a Shaun Tait delivery.

In the same match retiring fast bowler Brett Lee showed there was still life in the old dog yet after one of his trademark blistering deliveries smashed Craig Simmons' bat.

The 38-year-old Sydney Sixers star will retire at the end of his side's Big Bash campaign, but he stunned Adelaide's Simmons with a 149km/h yorker in the opening over, snapping his bat in two.

Simmons was left holding the handle of his bat as the remainder was sent flying down the wicket. Ever the gentleman, Lee pick what what was left of it and lobbed it back to the batsman with a big smile on his face,
