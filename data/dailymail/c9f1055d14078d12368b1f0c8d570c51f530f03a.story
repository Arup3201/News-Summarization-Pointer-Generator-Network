Lewis Hamilton continued his domination of the inaugural Russian Grand Prix to claim the 38th pole position of his Formula One career, but only after a major error from Williams' Valtteri Bottas.

After finishing comfortably quickest in the second and third practice runs around F1's newest venue, the Sochi Autodrom, Hamilton topped the timesheet in all three qualifying sessions. and will lead away the field on Sunday.

There was a scare, though, as Bottas was fastest in the first two sectors of the track on his final flying lap, only to make errors over the final third to finish third behind Hamilton and Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg.

Lewis Hamilton claims the 38th pole of his career. He appears to have the edge over Nico Rosberg here, but what of Valtteri Bottas? He was so close to splitting the Mercedes drivers until that error at the final corner. 

Russian GP Grid: 1 Hamilton; 2 Rosberg; 3 Bottas; 4 Button; 5 Kvyat; 6 Magnussen*, 7. Ricciardo, 8. Alonso, 9. Raikkonen, 10. Vergne 

*Magnussen will serve five-place grid penalty 

Lewis Hamilton improves on his time with a 1:38.513 and Rosberg doesn't have a response. But here is someone who can - it's Valtteri Bottas who is faster than anyone in the middle sector but the Finn can't keep his Williams under control through the final corners and has to settle for 3rd. He could have taken pole there. 

Rosberg responds and is up in the middle sector, but he has a scruffy end to his lap and he is two tenths shy of his team-mate. Bottas is 3rd with Button in 4th and Ricciardo 5th for Red Bull. 

But Hamilton is back on song and, for the moment, takes provisional pole with a 1:38.647.

Hamilton also had a problem at Turn 10 which would have compromised him through Turns 11 and 12, going some way to explaining his time. He is down in sixth, but is on another competitive lap... 

Raikkonen is first over the line with a 1:41.5... but here comes Hamilton, he makes a mistake at Turn 7, but still goes fastest.

Rosberg, however, trumps Hamilton by ONE SECOND with a 1:38.946. Bottas is second only a couple of tenths back. 

Hamilton is the first of the Mercedes drivers to take to the circuit. Surely, the Briton won't be beaten today? 

We're underway in Sochi and just 12 minutes away from finding out who will be on pole for the inaugural Russian Grand Prix. 

Here's a hugley disappointed Felipe Massa, who will start a miserable 18th tomorrow. 

'The only thing I know is that here was no power. There was a problem with the fuel pressure I think. I was trying to talk to them to get the power back in the engine but it was not possible. I am so disappointed.'

So, Hamilton finished the session almost three tenths clear of Rosberg. Over at Red Bull and Vettel was three tenths slower than Ricciardo...

Sebastian Vettel falls at the Q2 hurdle. He will start only 11th tomorrow. 

Perez, Hulkenberg, Gutierrez, Sutil, Vettel and Grosjean in the bottom six with one minute remaining...

Vettel improves on his time, but it is only good enough to promote him one place to 14th. Does the four-time World Champion have some sort of problem? Red Bull were expecting to struggle this weekend, but not by this much, surely? Ricciardo is 7th, over a second quicker than his team-mate...

But as I say that, Alonso slots in to P7 and Raikkonen is eighth fastest. Vettel is way down the order in 15th. 

Rosberg improves on his time, but he is still a quarter of a second shy of Hamilton. The Ferrari pair of Raikkonen and Alonso meanwhile are out of the top 10 with only five minutes left. 

Bottas currently splits the Mercedes with some six minutes remaining. The Finn really has been one of the breakthrough performers of this season. 

But what of Lewis Hamilton? Here comes the championship leader and he is SIX TENTHS faster than Rosberg and Co. It looks as though Hamilton has really stepped up a gear as he bids to win his first championship since 2008. 

Magnussen slots into second and is only four thousandths of a second of Rosberg's best time. McLaren appear to be back on form here. 

Button then goes almost seven tenths quicker than his former McLaren team-mate only for Rosberg to go fastest with a 1:38.9, four tenths quicker than Button. 

Sergio Perez is the first man over the line in the second part of qualifying with a 1:40.1. 

The 15-minute session, to determine which drivers go through to the top-10 shootout, in Sochi is underway. 

A nice touch from FOM (Formula One Management), who control the TV feed, to display a message of support to Bianchi on the exit of the final corner. 

Lewis Hamilton ends the session three tenths clear of Rosberg, with Bottas, in the sister Williams, the best of the rest in P3. 

Lots of concerned faces down at Williams as the chequered flag falls and Massa fails to improve on his time. And to make matters worse, Ericcsson goes faster than the former Ferrari man. Massa will start only 18th tomorrow. 

Massa: 'You need to do something. I cannot do anything.' 

The exasperated Brazilian is readying himself for one final run, but he really appears to be down on speed. 

Massa posts his best lap of the afternoon, but it is only good enough for P17 - the Brazilian, battling a problem with his Williams, is in real danger of missing out on Q2 here. 

With only three minutes remaining, Pastor Maldonado, Marcus Ericsson, Kamui Kobayashi, Max Chilton and a struggling Felipe Massa occupy the bottom five places.

Hamilton goes three tenths quicker than Rosberg as we see the German making a mistake at Turn 10 after running wide.

A 1:38.759 from Hamilton is only marginally slower than his best lap of the morning session. 

And Rosberg goes even quicker on the soft compound; some two tenths better than his first flyer. Button meanwhile is in fifth, running on the slower medium compound. A good effort from the British driver, still chasing a seat next season. 

But Nico Rosberg responds to his team-mate's time with a 1:39.292 which is almost seven tenths quicker than Hamilton. Kvyat is third with the McLarens of Magnussen and Button fourth and fifth respectively. 

But here comes the in-form Hamilton, who despite a lock-up, goes more than a second quicker than the Russian.

Jenson Button, who has impressed for McLaren this weekend, posts the fastest time of the session so far, only to be trumped by home favourite Daniil Kvyat in his Toro Rosso. 

Lewis Hamilton is the first of the frontrunners to take to the track. Hamilton is on the soft tyre, which would suggest Mercedes are not confident they'll be able to make it through to Q2 on the slower, medium compound. 

With Marussia entering only one car, it's worth noting that only five cars will be eliminated from this opening session. 

The pit lane is open and the opening 18-minute session is underway in Sochi. 

The drivers are strapped in their cockpits and ready for qualifying for tomorrow’s Russian Grand Prix. We will be underway in a couple of minutes.

The Sochi Autodrom is the newest venue to join the F1 calendar, with the track winding its way through the site that hosted the Winter Olympics earlier this year.

The organisers are proudly boasting it to be the only track in the world to be located in an Olympic venue, and the only one to be both permanent and a street circuit as it integrates into Sochi's general infrastructure during non-racing periods.

At 5.853km in length, it is the third longest circuit on the current calendar behind Silverstone (5.891km) and Spa (7.004km).

Although a street circuit, cars are expected to hit speeds of 200mph on the main straight between turns one and two.

The Russian Grand Prix weekend got off to the best of starts for British racing after Dean Stoneman stormed to a lights-to-flag victory in this morning’s GP3 race. After securing pole, the young Briton led from the front before posting the fastest lap, too. All of this on his debut for the Koiranen team; incredibly impressive.

Jules Bianchi's crash was so shocking that it's almost difficult to put into words. I was informed of the severity of his accident by the FIA immediately after the Japanese Grand Prix; that it was extremely serious and as such the race result became completely irrelevant. You would have seen that Lewis Hamilton, Sebastian Vettel and I did not spray any champagne on the podium. It wasn't a time to celebrate.

JONATHAN McEVOY EXCLUSIVE: British television coverage of the Russian Grand Prix - the most security-conscious race ever staged - could go blank moments before Vladimir Putin arrives at the Sochi Autodrom on Sunday.

Back on track and Lewis Hamilton has so far carried his good form through to Russia after setting a searing pace in this morning’s final practice session.

Despite a late spin, the Briton was the best part of three tenths clear of team-mate and rival for the championship Nico Rosberg, as he bids for his fourth straight win.

It’s been a difficult week for all of those connected with the sport of Formula One with Jules Bianchi in hospital following his horror crash at the Japanese Grand Prix.

The F1 paddock has returned to work this week, albeit with a heavy heart, for the inaugural Russian Grand Prix just days after Bianchi was left with a severe head trauma after he ploughed into the back of a tractor.

The drivers will sport tributes to Bianchi, fighting for his life in Mie University Hospital, with stickers on their crash helmets.

Jean-Eric Vergne, the Toro Rosso driver, countryman and close friend of Bianchi, summed up the mood in the paddock when he poignantly said: ‘I am not going to race for me. I am not going to race for my team. I am going to race for him’.
