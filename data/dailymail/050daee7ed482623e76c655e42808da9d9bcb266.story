A 36-year-old man has been charged with the murder of a mother-of-five who was found stabbed to death in a paddock in the New Forest as she tended to her horses.

Penelope Davis, 47, known as Pennie, was found with multiple stab wounds by her husband, Pete, near Beaulieu, Hampshire, on September 2.

This afternoon, detectives charged Justin Robertson, of no fixed address, with Ms Davis's murder. 

A 36-year-old man has been charged with the murder of Penelope Davis, 47, known as Pennie, who was found dead in a field near Beaulieu, Hampshire, on September 2

This afternoon, detectives from Hampshire Constabulary charged Justin Robertson, of no fixed abode, with Ms Davis's murder

Mrs Davis, pictured here on her wedding day in May with her husband Pete, had been stabbed multiple times when she was found by Mr Davis in the field five miles from their home 

Mr Robertson will remain in custody and is due to appear at Southampton Magistrates' Court on Monday, September 15. 

A spokesman for Hampshire Constabulary said Mrs Davis' family had been informed.  

John Montague, senior district crown prosecutor for the Crown Prosecution Service in Wessex, said: 'I have authorised Hampshire Constabulary to charge Justin Robertson with the murder of Penelope Davis, 47, from Blackfield, on 2 September.

'It is alleged that Mrs Davis was found killed when she was tending to her horses in a paddock near Leygreen Farm in Beaulieu. Her husband Peter Davis found her dead; she had sustained several stab wounds.

'I carefully reviewed all the available evidence provided to me by Hampshire Constabulary and in accordance with the Code for Crown Prosecutors I am satisfied that there is sufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction and it is in the public interest to prosecute Justin Robertson with the murder of Penelope Davis.

'Proceedings are now ongoing and the defendants have the right to a fair trial. It is very important that there should be no reporting, commentary or sharing of information online which could in any way prejudice these proceedings.'

Sainsbury's shop worker Mrs Davis - who married Mr Davis in May - was found in the field, five miles away from the couple's home in Blackfield, Hampshire.

Witnesses saw Mr Davis, who also works for a supermarket, sobbing uncontrollably as he knelt by his love's body.  

Mrs Davis' devastated children made a desperate plea for help to find her killer, hours before the arrest of Mr Robertson

Around 200 police officers and staff have been working on the investigation and the public have come forward with more than 230 calls with information.

Police have already charged suspect Leanne Doyle, 24, of Hythe, Hampshire, with assisting an offender and intending to pervert the course of justice.

She has been bailed and will reappear at Winchester Crown Court on October 1.

A 28-year-old woman, also from Hythe,  who was arrested on Thursday on suspicion of conspiracy to commit murder, has been released on bail until November 3.

A 22-year-old man, previously arrested on suspicion of murder, has been released on bail, while a 37-year-old man held on suspicion of assisting an offender has also been bailed.

Police continue to ask people with information about Mrs Davis's killing to contact them in confidence.

In particular, they would like to hear from anyone who may have seen anything suspicious near Mrs Davis's work at Sainsbury's, Blackfield between 1.30 and 3pm on the day she was found.

Police believe Mrs Davis was followed after leaving her work in her dark green Toyota Land Cruiser to Leygreen Farm in the New Forest. 

Around 200 police officers and staff have been working on the investigation, including searching a river for a weapon, just yards from where Mrs Davis was found

The public have come forward with more than 230 calls with information in the 11 days since her death

Detective Superintendent Paul Barton, leading the investigation, said: 'Pennie's death has had a significant impact on people living and working in the New Forest who are rightly concerned about what happened to her.

'I said early on, and I would like to say again today that there has never been any suggestion of a direct risk to the wider community.

'I appreciate our enquiries have also been a cause for concern and I would like to thank everyone affected for their understanding while we continue to investigate this brutal murder with minimal disruption to day-to-day life.

'I've been massively encouraged by the number of people who have come forward with information.

'During our week anniversary appeal work yesterday, we spoke to the occupants of around 960 vehicles, which has been incredibly useful.

'I'm asking anyone with information who has not already done so to get in touch.

'You may think what you saw or heard was insignificant, but it could be important to our enquiries and our efforts to secure justice for Pennie and her family.'  

Detectives are yet to confirm whether a murder weapon has been found but have previously said they may be looking for one or more assailants

Location: Mrs Davis was found by her husband in a field just yards from Leygreen Farm, in the New Forest

Mrs Davis' devastated children made a desperate plea for help to find her killer, hours before the arrest of Mr Robertson. 

Her husband Pete and her children Sophie, 20, Alex, 19, Georga, 18, Daniel, 15, and Josef, 13, described 'the void in their hearts' in the moving statement. 

The family said: 'It has been a long and agonising week since our precious mum and wife was selfishly taken from us.

'We had no idea how many lives she had touched and we have been overwhelmed by love and support.

'Despite this, the void in our hearts only continues to grow. The police have made progress in their investigation but there is still much more to be done.

'We only hope that no other family should ever have to go through the ordeal we are currently enduring.

'No other person deserves to have to go the way our poor mum and wife did. We will never begin to understand how scared and how alone she must have felt.

'This is why we are pleading for anybody with any information to come forward. Even if you think it won't make a difference, it might just be the call we were waiting for.'

Detectives are yet to confirm whether a murder weapon has been found but have previously said they may be looking for one or more assailants.

A total of 20 bouquets of flowers and written tributes remain by the gate to the paddock where shop worker Mrs Davis was found.
