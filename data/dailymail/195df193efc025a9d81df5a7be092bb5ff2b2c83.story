The blond-haired, blue-eyed killer called out to the campers and asked them to come closer.

Unsuspecting and trusting, they came over but when they did he killed them in a random and unprovoked attack.

According to one witness, he then shouted for them to come and said: 'It's safe to come out. You'll be saved.. I'm a cop!'

The gunman, who has been identified as Anders Breivik, 32, killed at least 80 people at an island summer youth camp north west of Oslo on Utoeya island.

His boots crunching along as he sought out his victims and wearing what appeared to be a police uniform, he shot at them twice to make sure they were dead.

One witness Thorbjorn Vereide, 22, said Breivik first started shooting then persisted that it was safe for people to come out.

He said: 'We were 30-40 people standing together when he started shooting. When he was done [with us] there were only five or six left of us.'

Mr Vereide then escaped to a nearby cave where he hid with a number of other youths.

'People were seriously injured, lying all around us. We didn't dare to go out of the cave, fearing that the gunman would discover our whereabouts,' he said to Norwegian newspaper VG.

"I've never lost anyone close before. Considering that, it's pretty dramatic to start off by losing 85 great friends."

Mr Vereide described the assailant as very calm, as he made sure his victims were indeed dead by shooting them twice.

"He just didn't seem to care," he added.

One of Breivik's victims, Adrian Pracon, who was shot in the shoulder as he lay face down, playing dead, said he heard the killer shouting about how everyone was going to die.

The 21-year-old said: 'He yelled out that he was going to 
kill us all and that we must all die. I started speculating and thinking
 this can't be real because Norwegian people wouldn't attack Norway.'

Mr Pracon also described how he could
 hear the blue-eyed gunman's boots as he walked along the rocks and felt
 his breath moments before he shot him in the back.

'I was lying on a rock, face down and I could hear him coming. I could feel his breath.

'As he approached, he shot at me to see if I was dead and fortunately I didn't move so he thought I was dead.

'I was laying there for two hours, still healthy but very cold.'

Before he was shot Mr Pracon said he 
had tried to escape the island by swimming into the ocean but only 
managed a short distance before deciding to turn back.

'I jumped into the water like the rest of the people but I did not have time to take my clothes off and it had started to rain.

'When I had swum about 100 metres I 
felt I had to turn back because I started to get very cold and felt I 
might meet a certain death.'

Once he reached the shore he saw Breivik who pointed his gun at him.

'I screamed to him, please no please.
 I didn't know if he didn't want to just kill me because I was one 
person or if he preferred to kill a group of people.

Another teenager, aged 15, who took refuge in the village of Sundvollen after the massacre said she stood just feet away from the gunman when he opened fire on the camp.

'I saw many dead people," said 15-year old Elise. The teenager said she had just come out from an information meeting in a nearby building when she heard gunshots.

She saw a police officer and thought she was safe, but then he started shooting.

'He first shot people on the island. Afterwards he started shooting people in the water," she said.

Elise said she hid behind the same rock that the killer was standing on. "I could hear his breathing from the top of the rock," she said. In panic, the girl phoned her parents, whispering to them what was going on.

'They told me not to panic and that everything would be OK," she said.Her parents also told her to get rid of a brightly coloured jacket she was wearing to not draw attention to herself.

She said it was impossible to say how many minutes passed while she was waiting for him to stop.

Survivors described a scene of sheer terror at the camp, which is organised by the youth wing of Norway's ruling Labour party.

Hundreds of young people were eagerly awaiting a speech the prime minister was to give there today.

Police said the man arrested in the shooting is Norwegian and had set off a bomb that killed seven people outside the prime minister's headquarters in Oslo, about 20 miles from the camp.

Several of the survivors seemed calm as anxious parents picked them up at a Sundvollen hotel, but the stories they told were of utter terror.

Dana Berzingi said the fake police officer ordered people to come closer, then pulled weapons and ammunition from a bag and started shooting.

Several victims "had pretended as if they were dead to survive," the 21-year-old said. But after shooting the victims with one gun, the gunman shot them again in the head with a shotgun, he said.

"I lost several friends," said Mr Berzingi, whose trousers were stained with blood. He said he used the mobile phone of one of his fallen friends to call police.

Emilie Bersaas told Sky News she ran inside a school building and hid under a bed when the shooting started.

'At one point the shooting was very, very close (to) the building, I think actually it actually hit the building one time, and the people in the next room screamed very loud," she said.

'I laid under the bed for two hours and then the police smashed a window and came in. It seems kind of unreal, especially in Norway. This is not something that could happen here.'

Another camper, Niclas Tokerud, stayed in touch with his sister through the attack through text messages.

'He sent me a text saying 'there's been gunshots. I am scared (expletive). But I am hiding and safe. I love you,'" said Nadia Tokerud, a 25-year-old graphic designer in Hokksund, Norway.

As he boarded a boat from the island after the danger had passed he sent one more text: "I'm safe.'
