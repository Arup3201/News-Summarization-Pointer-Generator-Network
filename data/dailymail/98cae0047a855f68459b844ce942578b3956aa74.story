France is so worried about its culinary reputation that authorities are set to introduce a 'homemade' logo to menus to prove to diners that food is freshly prepared.

The rise of microwaved and prep-prepared food being served up in French restaurants has prompted the move in a bid to safeguard the country's reputation as a gastronomic great.

From tomorrow, French restaurants will be able to use a specially-designed 'homemade' logo if the in-house chef has made everything from scratch.

Alternatively, the logo can be placed on the menu next to specific dishes that are made in-house to reassure diners that food is fresh.

An official government publication announced the change to secure France's culinary reputation, amid fears that pre-packaged food is diminishing the quality of dishes served in restaurants.

Consumer affairs minister Carole Delga said: 'The aim of this decree is to recognise the act of cooking, recognise a know-how... by giving the consumer simple and reliable information.'

And while frozen meat, delivered to restaurants to be used in homemade dishes will be allowed to use the logo, other frozen items may not.

High standards: The new 'homemade' logo will only apply to dishes created completely in-house

Ms Delga explained: 'Frozen chips for example are not part of this decree. That means that those used by fast-food restaurants will not be considered homemade, just like sauces that arrive ready-made will not be considered homemade.'

However, other pre-prepared foods will be allowed to be included in 'homemade' dishes, such as pasta, bread, cheese and wine.

The new legislation is a bid to improve what many say are declining standards in French restaurants.

In recent months, France has taken various steps to encourage more tourists to visit.

Ministers have told French citizens to be 'nicer' to tourists, while Chinese police have also been draughted in to help big-spending Chinese tourists in Paris.

Legislation to force certain shops to open for Sunday trading is another way France is attempting to make itself more appealing to travellers - particularly those from China and Russia.
