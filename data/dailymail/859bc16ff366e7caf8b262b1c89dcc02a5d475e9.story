From old television sets with only two channels, to salt and pepper shakers found inside an abandoned TB hospital, these images document the slow but steady decline of rural Britain. 

This incredible set of photographs, taken across 15,000 miles of Norfolk's most rugged terrain, brings home the reality of that disappearing lifestyle like never before.

From rotting farmhouses to rusting cars and even a set of abandoned petrol pumps, photographer Brian Wells, 43, has sought to bring the decline of the countryside to life.

Decay: A rusting pick-up truck is pictured on the old site of Medlars Vehicle Dismantler's, near Stratton Strawless in the Norfolk countryside

Forgotten: Petrol pumps covered with old, peeling red paint, were discovered by photographer Brian Wells, 43, close to the village of Seething

Rotting: Paradise Farm, a Grade II listed 17th century farmhouse situated on private land in Stradsett, which is now being renovated

Ancient: An old Aga is seen at Bessingham Manor House, which has now been fully restored. Legend has it that one of the former owners, Edmund Spurrell, used to entertain the guests at dinner parties with a dancing bear which is buried in the grounds

Relics: Medicine bottles found in a large derelict house in the village of Methwold, know locally as 'The Pickelman's House', due the fact that there are a multitude of pickle jars in the pantry

He said 'My photographs highlight the beauty in the broken that we usually overlook. I am drawn to the history held within the abandoned buildings and rusting rustic objects, and marvels at the possibilities that each alludes to. 

'Ruins capture the viewer’s imagination with their ability to tell stories. They are a window into human histories, silent rooms with dust covered furniture, discarded objects that are left behind and a smell of mustiness lingering in the air echoing a past long gone. 

'I feel that one of the most powerful aspects of a ruin is the subject that's missing in the photograph - the people who once worked and lived in these places. Their presence can still be felt.'

Time gone by: An old container of Cadbury's Marvel dried milk power and a glass jar prop up a copy of Parade magazine on a rotting shelf at this unknown location

Lost choice: Dials on this television set show it dates from a time when there were only two channels, almost unthinkable to those born today

Gone bust: While the numbers on these tiles may appear to be random, they are in fact prices, found inside the old Yallops Shoes store on St. Augustines Street, Norwich

Spooky: This shot was taken inside an old prefabricated bungalow named 'Regina', in Felthorpe. A swathe of prefab homes were built to house those whose homes were destroyed after the Second World War

Packed up: This suitcase was found in a forlorn cottage on the side of the busy A47 towards Kings Lynn in the village of East Winch. A luggage tag still attached to it reads 'Albert'

Brian said he uses ordinance survey maps, and an ancient Kelly's Dictionary, the Victorian equivalent of the Yellow Pages, in order to track down the long forgotten sites.

He added: 'Checking out the Auction pages in local newspapers is useful and 'Urban Exploration' websites also come in handy. 

“I always seek permission where possible to photograph the property, especially if it is not isolated. Most of the time I get a positive reply.' 

Empty: These old salt and pepper shakers were found inside a former night porters' cabin, at an abandoned TB Hospital in Mundesley

Fancy a sit down? This tatty armchair, discovered in an abandoned house in an unknown location, has not been used in decades

Not in use: A rusting plug socket for a cooker is seen on a mouldy wall in derelict cottage on the outskirts of the Toftrees estate, Norfolk

Peeling: Sixties-style wallpaper is seen falling from the damp walls inside a derelict cottage located along Doles Lane, in Bradwell

Stuck in the past: An out-dated doll figure is seen standing in front of three mirrors inside an abandoned house at an unknown location
