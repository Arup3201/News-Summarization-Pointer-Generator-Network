General Motors Co will pay compensation for 19 deaths linked to a faulty ignition switch, according to the lawyer overseeing the compensation process, more than the 13 deaths the automaker had previously admitted were caused by the now recalled part.

The death toll tied to faulty ignition switches in GM's small cars has risen to 19 people - and that number is likely to go higher.

Kenneth Feinberg said today that he has determined that 19 wrongful death claims are eligible for payments from GM. General Motors' estimate of deaths has stood at 13 for months although the automaker acknowledged the possibility of a higher count.

Feinberg received 125 death claims due to the faulty switches in older-model small cars such as the Chevrolet Cobalt. The rest remain under review or require further documentation, he said in a report issued on Monday.

'The public report is simply reporting on those eligible to date,' Feinberg spokeswoman Camille Biros said in an email. 'There will certainly be others.'

GM has admitted knowing about the ignition switch problem for more than a decade. Yet it didn't begin recalling the switches in 2.6 million small cars until earlier this year. 

Feinberg is still reviewing claims of death and injury that occurred due to the risk that an ignition switch could slip out of the 'run' position, stalling the vehicles and disabling the cars' airbags.

The automaker hired Feinberg to compensate victims of crashes caused by the switches, and Feinberg has said GM has not limited the total amount he can pay. Some lawmakers have estimated the death toll is close to 100.

Biros, citing confidentiality agreements, said Feinberg will not identify any of those eligible for payments, nor will he say if the 19 deemed eligible so far include the 13 deaths that GM has documented. GM has not identified the 13 victims. 

The U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration says it has not tallied the total number of deaths.

Biros said no claims have been rejected yet, although Feinberg is in the process of turning down a few because they don't meet the requirements for compensation. Feinberg will issue reports each Monday on how many claims have been granted, she said.

Feinberg also has received 320 claims for compensation due to injuries. Of those, 12 have been deemed eligible for payments so far.

Of the injury claims, 58 were in the most serious category, seeking compensation for injuries resulting in loss of use of limbs, amputation, permanent brain damage or pervasive burns, the Feinberg statement said. 

Another 262 claims are for less-serious injuries that required hospital stays or outpatient medical treatment within 48 hours of the crash.

Attorney Bob Hilliard, who said he represents 11 of the approved death claims, expects his clients to receive compensation offers within 10 days.

The offers are expected to be high in order to persuade beneficiaries from filing lawsuits against GM.

The deadline for filing a claim is December 31. Feinberg will follow formulas to determine how much people will get, and they can demonstrate circumstances to him that would bring more money. Claimants can wait until he comes up with an amount before deciding whether to sue GM or take the money.

General Motors CEO Mary Barra says a 'pattern of incompetence and neglect' led to a long-delayed recall of faulty ignitions in their Chevy Cobalt

GM has estimated the cost of compensating victims at $400 million, but says it could rise to $600 million.

The faulty ignition switches can slip out of the 'run' position into 'accessory' or 'off,' cutting off power to the engine. That can knock out power steering or brakes and disable the air bags if there's a crash.

The ignition switch problem triggered a company-wide safety review that has resulted in 29 million GM vehicles being recalled through August.

Despite persistent bad publicity for much of the year, GM's sales haven't been significantly harmed by the spate of recalls. GM's U.S. sales are up 2.8 per cent through August. U.S. auto sales overall have risen 5.1 per cent during the same time.

GM dealers have been able to convert customers who come in for recall repairs into new-car buyers when they see renovated dealerships and the company's new vehicles, GM North American President Alan Batey said Monday in an interview. Many customers are first-time GM buyers, having bought used cars in the past, he said.
