Jairo Ben, who had moved to the Phillippines only two months ago, was discovered near a mass grave after the typhoon

The body of a six-year-old British boy was among around 1,000 corpses at a mass grave in the typhoon-ravaged Philippines.

His mother, Mary Joy Escalante Ducusin, who also lost her husband in the disaster, sobbed bitterly as she discovered the bag bearing his tiny corpse waiting to be put into the pit in a cemetery above the badly hit city of Tacloban.

'For several days I kept on searching for him but now I have found him,' she cried.

'No words could really explain how painful it is.'

Ducusin and her husband, Jeff, 45, both Philippines nationals, moved to Britain several years ago to work as nurses in Harlow, near London.

Their only child, Jairo Ben, was born there six years ago. He was a British passport holder and grew up speaking English.

Two months ago the family moved back to the Philippines to start a new life.

But weeks later the monster typhoon smashed into Tacloban, bringing a destructive storm surge that swamped entire neighbourhoods.

'It was so quick,' she recalled. 'All I remember was the water rising to the top of my house.'

Beyond grief: Mrs Ducusin says 'I don't want to think about tomorrow. I just want to live life day by day, I don't know where to start, I don't know where to pick up the pieces'

Jairo Ben, Ducusin, her husband and his mother climbed onto the roof, but were blown off by the 200mph winds of Super Typhoon Haiyan that smashed through the central Philippines on November 8.

The 37-year-old Ducusin was the family's sole survivor of the typhoon.

'We were carried to the second floor of a house nearby. But I didn't see my mother-in-law or my six-year-old boy again.'

She scoured the debris left by the monster flood for days in the desperate hope of finding him.

'One of my neighbours sent me a text message saying that they had found a boy, like six years old with the green shirt and the stuffed toy,' she said.

Typhoon Haiyan ripped through Tacloban in the Philippines, and has been described as one of the most powerful typhoons ever to hit land

Authorities estimate more than 3,900 people were killed when Typhoon Haiyan, one of the largest ever recorded, made landfall in the central Philippines and the sea surged ashore

'My baby loves the stuffed toy so much because when he was born, even in the hospital, he got that stuffed toy. He called it Cocoa.'

The unidentified bodies are among the around 4,000 people known to have died in one of the most powerful storms ever recorded. The bodies are bagged and taken away by firemen on trucks that patrol Tacloban.

They are then transported to a cemetery above the city for rudimentary identification by a forensic pathologist, who records the height and gender of each corpse, along with any distinguishing marks, and ascribes a number to each body.

Then they are put into the communal grave.

On Tuesday more than 700 putrefying bodies lay piled on top of each other in the grave. Around 250 more were waiting to be processed. Among them was that of Jairo Ben.

'I don't want to think about tomorrow,' said his heartbroken mother.

'I just want to live life day by day, I don't know where to start, I don't know where to pick up the pieces.'
