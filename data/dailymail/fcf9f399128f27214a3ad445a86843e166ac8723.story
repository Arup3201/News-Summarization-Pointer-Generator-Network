Climate change will cause ‘irreversible damage’ to the Great Barrier Reef by 2030 unless immediate action is taken, marine scientists have warned.

Australia’s iconic heritage site is at a turning point, and coral will be destroyed ‘for hundreds if not thousands of years’ by hikes in carbon dioxide and the average global temperature, states a report published today.

Experts are calling for an ‘increase in commitment’ to lower carbon emissions to help protect the reef, which has already lost about half its coral coverage since the 1980s, with climate change fast becoming its main threat.

Unless the average global temperature is kept below the internationally agreed limit of 2C warming on pre-industrial levels, ‘it is highly unlikely that coral reefs will survive’, according to University of Queensland reef researcher Ove Hoegh-Guldberg, co-author of the Lights Out For the Reef report.

He said current climate trends and a 'business as usual' temperature increase of 4C would mean ‘game over’ for the Great Barrier Reef.

‘Even under the best-case scenario of 2C, corals disappear,’ Hoegh-Guldberg told Guardian Australia. ‘But with business as usual, it’s game over. You look in the tank and the corals have died, bacteria have taken over, the sand has dissolved.

‘It’s a very, very poor place. If you were to replicate that on the Great Barrier Reef, it would hardly be worthy of the word “great”. It simply won’t be a coral reef.’

And he called coral bleaching, which 
occurs when sea water temperatures becomes too warm and results in coral
dying faster – a process unknown on the Great Barrier Reef before 1979 –
a ‘serious threat’.

‘If we
don't increase our commitment to solve the burgeoning stress from local
and global sources, the reef will disappear,’ he wrote in the foreword 
to the report, compiled by WWF as part of its Earth Hour campaign.

‘This is not a hunch or alarmist rhetoric by green activists. It is the conclusion of the world's most qualified coral reef experts.’

Hoegh-Guldberg said the Great Barrier Reef, which generates $6billion a year from tourism and supports 63,000 jobs, was at a turning point.

‘It is highly unlikely that coral 
reefs will survive more than a two degree increase in average global 
temperature relative to pre-industrial levels,’ he said.

‘But
if the current trajectory of carbon pollution levels continues 
unchecked, the world is on track for at least three degrees of warming. 
If we don't act now, the climate change damage caused to our Great 
Barrier Reef by 2030 will be irreversible.’

Dr
Selina Ward, co-author of the report, told the Sydney Morning Herald: 
‘One of the most important functions of the reef is as a wave barrier. 
That protection will be lost.

‘Without the reef, a lot of islands will be swamped.’

The Great Barrier Reef, one of the most biodiverse places on earth, teems with marine life and will be the focus of Australia's Earth Hour - a global campaign which encourages people and organisations to switch off their lights for one hour on March 29 for climate change.

The report comes as the reef, considered one of the most vulnerable places in the world to the impacts of climate change, is at risk of having its status downgraded by the UN cultural organisation UNESCO to ‘world heritage in danger’.

Despite threats of a downgrade without action on rampant coastal development and water quality, Australia in December approved a massive coal port expansion in the region and associated dumping of dredged waste within the marine park's boundaries.
