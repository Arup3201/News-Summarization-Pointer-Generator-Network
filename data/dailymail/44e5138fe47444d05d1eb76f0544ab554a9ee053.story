Serena Williams has been forced to retire injured from her doubles match alongside sister Venus in some of the most surreal scenes witnessed at Wimbledon.

The five-times singles champion was majorly struggling with illness after her warm-up and had her blood pressure taken by a doctor, who consulted with her for nearly 15 minutes.

During this time Serena was asked, 'Are you not fit to play?' as she wiped tears from her eyes and appeared distraught.

Sick: Serena was in tears during the warm-up when a doctor asked her if she was able to play

Struggling: The world number one looked visibly unwell during the pre-match hitting

Static: Serena was virtually unable to move and looked extremely uncomfortable as the sisters went 3-0 behind

She was heard to reply something such as, ‘I don’t feel like I can do anything.’

But she mustered on and her sister opened the serving, only to be broken when Serena could barely run for a drop shot and winced as she missed entirely.

When it came for Serena to serve she could hardly bounce the ball, repeatedly failed to throw it up properly, then sent both her first and second serves into the bottom of the net.

The 17-times Grand Slam champion looked dazed, and playing as if she had never before picked up a racket.

Down and Out: Williams served four double faults, including several serves dumped into the net, before retiring

Distraught: Serena told doctors 'I don't feel like I can do anything', but they ruled her fit to play

Assessment: The umpire came down from his chair to check if Serena was fit enough during her service game

Her following serves were all double-faulted – variously sent into the net and long – and at 0-40 to opponents Kristina Barrois and Stefanie Voegele umpire Kader Nouni came down off his chair to check on the 32-year-old’s fitness.

Spectators in the crowd should words of encouragement. ‘We love you Serena,’ said one. ‘Hang in there,’ said another.

But after a
 further double fault handed the game to Barrois and Voegele, Serena 
immediately retired injured with the match at 3-0.

It
 marks the end of the Williams’s sisters Wimbledon after both were 
knocked out of the singles event. They were the 8th seeds in the doubles
 tournament.

Support: The Wimbledon crowd continued to get behind the five-time champion despite her inability to play

Exit: The sisters leave the court after retiring - they are now both out of all draws at Wimbledon

Pain: The 17-time Grand Slam winner and her sister Venus were seeded eighth in the women's doubles

Virus: Shortly after the match the WTA confirmed that Serena was suffering from a 'viral illness'

VIDEO Wimbledon: Day eight roundup

Since the match, the WTA have announced Serena is suffering from a viral illness.

Pam Shriver, working in her capacity as an ESPN analyst, was on court and said it was one of the stranger episodes she had seen.

'You can have reasons not to feel right on the court but nothing that would make you not be able to hold the ball in your hand or catch the ball after a bounce or throw the ball up,' Shriver said. 'You might hit four double faults in a row but you'd make contact.'

Shriver questioned: 'Is this a drama? Is this an act? If you're not well, you need to get help.'
