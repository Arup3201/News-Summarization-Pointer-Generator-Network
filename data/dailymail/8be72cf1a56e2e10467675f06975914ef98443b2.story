A French doctor faces life imprisonment if he is convicted of poisoning seven terminally-ill patients at a hospital in Bayonne, south west France.

Nicolas Bonnemaison, 53, has been accused of administering lethal injections to the patients to help them die in alleged mercy killings.

His lawyer Arnaud Dupin said Dr 
Bonnemaison, who was struck off amid the allegations, faces life in prison if he is convicted of the charges.

Nicolas Bonnemaison, 53, pictured left with his wife Julie and right with his lawyer Arnaud Dupin, arrived at the court in Pau, southwestern France, today where he will be tried for poisoning seven terminally-ill patients

The trial, which is taking place in Pau, near to the city of Bayonne, comes amid debate in France over whether to legalise
 euthanasia or loosen laws on treatment for people with incurable 
illnesses.

The medic, who worked in the emergency department, is accused of having poisoned the terminally-ill patients - described as 'particularly vulnerable people' - between March 2010 and July 2011.

He is also accused of having given drugs to the patients without asking other doctors' advice.

During his first day in court, where he arrived supported by his wife Julie, Dr Bonnemaison said: 'I'm thinking of the patients today.

'You experience powerful things with terminally-ill patients, things that leave their mark on doctors.

'They leave their mark on the human being too, beyond our job as doctors. It's important that the family be informed so that they can understand what is going on.'

Dr Bonnemaison faced a media circus as he arrived at the courthouse for 
the start of his trial. He faces life imprisonment if he is convicted of
 the crimes, his lawyer said

He added that he hoped he had been 'up to the challenge' before adding: 'I did what I could'.

The case came to light in August 2011 
after the doctor was reported to bosses by nurses and a carer who said they found his behaviour suspicious.

The case, which came after the doctor was struck off, has stirred up considerable emotion, including among the victims' families

The trial has since stirred up considerable emotion, 
including among the victims' families.

In comments made on television as the trial began, the widow of one the patients said she had asked Bonnemaison to help her husband die, and that what the doctor did was 'good'.

Patricia Dhooge, her voice shaking with emotion, said in remarks carried on French television Wednesday that 'it would hurt me very much if they gave him any kind of punishment'.

A petition in favour of the defendant has also garnered 60,000 signatures.

Euthanasia is illegal in France, but President Francois Hollande promised during his 2012 campaign to look into legalising the hugely divisive practice.

A law passed in France in 2005 has already legalised passive euthanasia, where a person causes death by withholding or withdrawing treatment that is necessary to maintain life.

Last year, a panel set up by Hollande also recommended legalising assisted suicide.

That allows a doctor to provide a patient with all the necessary lethal substances to end their life, but lets them carry out the final act.
