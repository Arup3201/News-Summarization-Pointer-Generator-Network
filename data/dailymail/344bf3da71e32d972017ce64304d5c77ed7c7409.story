Hatem Ben Arfa will be sent back to Newcastle in January with Hull boss Steve Bruce having lost patience with the on-loan forward.

The 27-year-old joined the Tigers on deadline day after Alan Pardew had banished him to the reserves on Tyneside.

But Ben Arfa – who was substituted after 35 minutes during the 3-0 defeat at Manchester United on November 29 and hasn't been seen since – will now return to St James' Park when Hull terminate his loan deal in the new year.

Hull boss Steve Bruce has grown frustrated with Ben Arfa and says he has no future at the KC Stadium

'Sometimes transfers work out and sometimes they don't,' said Bruce.

'It's fair to say with Ben Arfa that I can't see there being a future. It's a team and you've got to reform and come into the team.

'Unfortunately he wants to do things his way, which is fair enough, so unless he changes...

'I'll treat him like any other player. There's been no fall-out, he's been omitted from the squad because when you're up against it you need to show a bit of resilience. Unfortunately Hatem sees it differently.

'It's a shame because we were excited to get him on deadline day but in three or four months it hasn't happened.' 

Ben Arfa's contract at Newcastle expires at the end of the season and they are likely to send him out on loan for the remainder of the campaign.
