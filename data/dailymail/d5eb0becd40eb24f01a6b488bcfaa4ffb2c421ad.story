The majority of U.S. women - 53per cent - will be following Kim Kardashian's lead by wearing one-piece bathing suits this summer, with most admitting that this option is better for their body shape.

Of the 2,321 women polled by money-saving website CouponCodes4u, only 18per cent planned on emulating celebrities like Rihanna and Hayden Panettiere by sporting a bikini on the beach.

The remaining 29per cent said they would choose a tankini as their swimsuit of choice.

Body conscious: More than half of women in America are opting to cover up in a one-piece bathing suit on the beach instead - like voluptuous beauties Sofia Vergara, 40 (left) and Kim Kardashian, 32 (right)

Of the respondents who planned on 
wearing a one-piece to the beach, 57per cent said it was because this 
conservative choice was better suited to their body shape.

A third of the women who wanted to wear a one-piece explained it was the 'more comfortable' option.

According to the study, it would appear that women choose their swimwear based on how flattering it is more than any other reason.

63per cent of the women polled said that they purchased a particular bathing suit only if it enhanced their body shape.

The
study was intended to determine whether or not American women have become more 
self-conscious about their beach bodies, and to see if their insecurities have affected their choice of beachwear.

Indeed, when the women were asked if they thought they had the perfect beach body, an overwhelming 82per cent said they did not.

Mark Pearson, chairman of CouponCodes4u,
said of the findings: 'While bikinis were once the most popular choice 
of swimwear, it seems that some American women no longer feel that this 
fashion piece is right for them or their body shape.'

He added: 'More consumers seem to be 
flocking back to the one-piece or even the tankini, citing comfort and 
body shape as their top purchasing factors.'

Not only have women apparently become more self-conscious of their bodies, but they also are increasingly fretting over the pressures of beach season.

A third of respondents - 34per cent - said they planned on dieting in the lead-up to bikini season.

The study also discovered that while women may be increasingly insecure about exposing their bodies on the beach, that hasn't stopped them from buying swimwear altogether.

The average amount spent on bathing suits each year was $54.79, with each woman buying an average of 2.5 new pieces of swimwear per year.

Mr Pearson remarked on the study: 'What is important to mention is when picking the right option for your swimsuit, make sure you choose one that can last more than one season as otherwise you will be wasting your money.'

He added that finding the right bathing suit can be difficult, but worth it: 'Choosing the right swimsuit is a bit like choosing the right suit - it can be expensive but get it right and it will last for many seasons to come, and you will look and feel your best while on vacation or at the beach.'
