Liverpool fell to a surprise 3-1 defeat at Upton Park on Saturday evening as West Ham scored two early goals to dent Liverpool’s title challenge.

Winston Reid headed West Ham ahead after only two minutes before Diafra Sakho lobbed Simon Mignolet with a sublime chip after seven minutes to double the lead for the Hammers.

England starlet Raheem Sterling fired in a low drive to reduce Liverpool’s deficit before half-time but Brendan Rodgers’ side failed to overhaul West Ham’s fine performance with Morgan Amalfitano completing the scoring late on.

Sportsmail’s Sami Mokbel was there and rates the West Ham and Liverpool players below.

West Ham United (4-4-2)

ADRIAN - No chance with the Sterling's strike and held firm as Liverpool threw caution to the wind. Booked. 6.5

GUY DEMEL - Had his hands full with Liverpool's fluid attacking unit and coped well before being substituted. 6.5

JAMES TOMKINS  - Has had his detractors in recent weeks, but coped well with Balotelli's threat yesterday. 7

WINSTON REID - West Ham need to get the New Zealander signed up to a new deal ASAP. Solid again. Booked. 7.5

AARON CRESSWELL - Solid display from the left-back. Easy to see why he was so highly-rated at Ipswich. 7

MARK NOBLE - Typical display from the hammers skipper. On point with his passing and discipline in midfield. 7.5

CHEIKOU KOUYATE - Powerful and energetic in midfield. Can see how he kept Momo Diame out of the team. Booked. 8

ALEX SONG - Bossed the midfield for late sections of the game. Great piece of business by Sam Allardyce to sign him. Booked. 7.5 

West Ham captain Mark Noble put in a typical solid performance for the Hammers in the midfield

STEWART DOWNING - Led the line for the Hammers and caused his former club a host of problems in the first half. 7

ENNER VALENCIA - Industrious and economical for the Hammers. The Ecuadorian looks a real class act. 7

DIAFRA SAKHO  - Ran, ran and ran. His work-rate and directness was infectious against the Merseysiders. 7

Diafra Sakho scored a fine chip to double West Ham's lead on seven minutes as the Hammers won 3-1

SUBS: 

CARL JENKINSON (for Demel 61) - Helped see out late Liverpool pressure. Booked. 6

JAMES COLLINS (for Valencia 76) - Experience was key for the Hammers late on. 6

MORGAN AMALFITANO (for Song 69) - Shored up West Ham's midfield in the closing minutes and scored vital third. 6.5

SUBS NOT USED: Zarate, Vaz Te, Jaaskelainen, Cole. 

 Morgan Amalfitano was a late substitute at Upton Park but still managed to have a strong impact with a goal

Liverpool (4-4-2) 

SIMON MIGNOLET - Brilliant shot stopper but his ability to to stop crosses, however, remains suspect. 5

JAVIER MANQUILLO - Lasted just 22 minutes before enduring the embarrassment of being substituted. A day to forget. 4

MARTIN SKRTEL -  Looked uncomfortable dealing with West Ham's excellent front three. Not the Slovakian's best day. 5 

DEJAN LOVREN - Shaky opening 35 minutes became even shakier following a hefty blow on the head in a collision with team-mate Sakho.5 

ALBERTO MORENO - Caught out of position on occasions, particularly in the first-half. Decent outlet going forward, though. 5.5

STEVEN GERRARD - The game bypassed the Liverpool skipper a little bit. Found Song and Kouyate's power in midfield too much to handle. 5 

JORDAN HENDERSON - Should have done better with West Ham's first, but still tried to drive his side forward. 6 

LUCAS - Contributed very little to his side in the first half and was duly substituted at half-time. 5 

RAHEEM STERLING - Hauled his side back into the game. Overtaking Steven Gerrard as Liverpool's most important player. 7 

England international Raheem Sterling was his usual influential self, scoring with a fine low strike

FABIO BORINI - Didn't show enough to convince Liverpool fans he is an adequate replacement for Daniel Sturridge. 5.5

MARIO BALOTELLI - Cut a frustrated figure for much of the game, but showed flashes of brilliance to scare West Ham. 6 

Liverpool striker Mario Balotelli failed to replicate his Champions League scoring heroics from midweek

SUBS: 

MAMADOU SAKHO (for Manquillo 22) - Thrown into action early after Liverpool's calamitous start to the game - but didn't look comfortable. 5 

ADAM LALLANA (for Lucas 46) - Liverpool looked a much better team when he came on. 7

RICKIE LAMBERT (for Borini 75) - Couldn't find an equaliser for his side. 5 

SUBS NOT USED: Jones, Jose Enrique, Toure, Markovic.
