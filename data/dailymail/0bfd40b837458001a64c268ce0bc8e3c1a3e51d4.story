Waste? Fish oil contains vitamin D

Taking vitamin D supplements in order to ward off illness could be a waste of time, a study shows.

Scientists saw little evidence that the pills lowered the risk of cancer, heart disease, stroke, Alzheimer’s Disease, Parkinson’s or other diseases.

For decades, scientists assumed that the mineral, one of the most popular supplements in Britain, had numerous health benefits.

But a review of 462 studies involving more than a million adults has concluded that a lack of vitamin D is not a trigger for many common illnesses.

In Britain, the supplements market is worth £700million a year – a growth of 16 per cent in five years – and the most popular pills are multivitamins and fish oils, which contain vitamin D.

The main reason scientists thought vitamin D could protect against disease was that patients with cancer, heart disease or Alzheimer’s had very low levels of the nutrient.

But the French researchers now suspect that, rather than vitamin D deficiency leading to disease, these illnesses stop the body from producing vitamin D, so sufferers have lower levels.

Lead author Professor Philippe Autier, from the International  Prevention Research Institute  in Lyon, France, said: ‘What this  discrepancy suggests is that decreases in vitamin D levels are a marker of deteriorating health. Ageing and inflammatory processes involved in disease occurrence . . . reduce vitamin D concentrations, which would explain why vitamin D deficiency is reported in a wide range of disorders.’

But his study – published in The Lancet – did not cast doubt on the supplement’s effect on the bones.

The mineral is known to protect against bone thinning and the bone disorder rickets.

Two months ago the chief medical officer, Dame Sally Davies, called for free vitamins to be given to children after it emerged that a quarter of youngsters are short of vitamin D.

Presently it is only available on  prescription to under fives from low income families.

In addition, pregnant women and those 
who are breastfeeding are advised to take one vitamin D tablet a day – 
which they can get on prescription – to ensure their baby’s bones are 
healthy. Other academics said more research was needed before vitamin D 
was discounted.

Professor 
Peter Selby, honorary clinical professor of metabolic  bone disease at 
Manchester Royal Infirmary, said: ‘One problem with this sort of 
systematic review is that it can only examine the studies  which have 
been published previously, so it is limited by the level of vitamin D in
 subjects in these studies.

More investigation: Other academics said further research was needed before vitamin D was discounted

‘It could very well be that the apparent negative results of this study have been obtained simply because they have not been looking at people with a sufficient degree of vitamin D insufficiency to have any meaningful biological effect.’

Other recent studies have also cast doubt on the curative properties of vitamin D supplements.

In one case, scientists found ‘no convincing evidence’ that vitamin D supplements would fend off a cold. Testing was carried out on more than 300 adults in New Zealand over 18 months in 2010 and 2011.

Half were given extra vitamin D while the rest took placebo tablets.

The vitamin D group caught 3.7 colds per person on average, compared with 3.8 colds per person for the placebo group.

In October, a review of previous studies by University of Auckland researchers claimed taking vitamin D supplements did not improve bone mineral density at the hip, spine, forearm or in the body as a whole.

Professor Ian Reid, the study’s leader, said: ‘Most healthy adults do not need vitamin D supplements.

‘Our data suggest the targeting of low-dose vitamin D supplements only to individuals who are likely to be deficient could free up substantial resources that could be better used elsewhere in healthcare.’

Professor Reid reviewed 23 studies examining the effects of vitamin D supplements on bone density
