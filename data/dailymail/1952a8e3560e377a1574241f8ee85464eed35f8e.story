A cunning fox gives firefighters and locals the slip and leads them on a wild goose chase inside a building in the seaside city of Valparaiso, Chile in this video.

The footage was filmed on Friday, September 26 and it lasts for just over one minute.   

The firefighters had been called to the building after reports of a wild fox inside the building in the Florida district of the city.

'(It was) totally surprising because I have never seen a fox before,' commented a local resident about her surprise visitor.

The agile animal managed to outrun and outsmart the firefighters along with local residents and volunteers who tried to catch the fox in order to return him to his natural habitat.

'We couldn't get very close as it was young,' said another local resident who had been witness to the whole event.

Running wild: The wild fox is seen running free during the video which lasts for just over one minute

Plan: Firefighters move closer to the rampaging fox as they attempt to catch the wild animal

Restless: The fox looks restless and anxious as the firefighters gather around him and moments later he slips

Just before the fox managed to escape, it reportedly tried to bite a firefighter that was trying to grab the animal.

Local police captain, Ingeborg Villa, blamed the firefighters' lack of planning for the animals' escape.

'The firefighters should have) adopted a procedure that corresponded (to the situation) to successfully rescue the animal (which did not happen),' he added.

The fox managed to escape in the end by jumping off the building from a balcony and then ran off.

Level down: After the fox falls off the railing he lands a level down and is free to start roaming again

Getaway: The wild fox looks down at the drop from the first floor of the apartment block down onto the road

Gone: The fox then jumps down from the first floor onto the roadside and he rushes off
