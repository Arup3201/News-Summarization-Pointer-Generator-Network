'Sending strong signal': U.S. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta gave the go-ahead today for two Patriot missile batteries and 400 troops to be sent to Turkey to defend against the threat of Syrian rocket attacks

U.S. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta gave an order today to send two Patriot missile batteries to Turkey with 400 American personnel to operate them in a move by NATO members to bolster Turkey's defences against the threat of Syrian rockets.

The go-ahead was signed shortly before Panetta arrived on an unannounced visit to Turkey to meet American troops stationed at the Incirlik Air Base, the last stop on a week-long trip that took him to Afghanistan and Kuwait.

'The purpose of this deployment is to signal very strongly that the United States, working closely with our NATO allies, is going to support the defense of Turkey, especially with potential threats emanating from Syria,' spokesman George Little said.

NATO-member Turkey has repeatedly 
scrambled jets along the countries' joint frontier and responded in kind
when shells from the Syrian conflict came down inside its borders, 
fanning fears that the civil war could spread to destabilise the region.

The widely expected U.S. move follows
similar steps by Germany and the Netherlands, which also said they will
send two Patriot batteries.

The three countries are the only NATO 
nations with the most modern type of Patriots.

Little declined to say where the U.S. 
batteries would be located and said the systems would be deployed to 
Turkey for an unspecified amount of time.

'We expect them to be deployed in the coming weeks,' Little said.

NATO approved Turkey's request for air
defence batteries on December 4, in a move meant to calm its fears of 
coming under missile attack, possibly with chemical weapons, from Syria.

The Patriot system is designed to intercept aircraft or missiles.

NATO says the measure is purely 
defensive, but Russia, Syria and Iran have criticised the decision, 
saying it increases regional instability.

The decision comes days after the Syrian government escalated hostilities with rebel forces by firing more than six scud missiles.

Rising tensions: The decision to send Patriot missiles (seen here during the Iraq war in 2003) to Turkey comes amid fears the civil war could spread to destabilise the region

Escalating conflict: The decision comes days after the Syrian government escalated hostilities by firing more than six scud missiles (like these Iraqi ones seen in 2003) at rebel forces

The
attacks are thought to have been the first time President Bashar 
Assad's military has used missiles to attack insurgents during the 
two-year conflict.

U.S. 
officials said Assad's troops fired several missiles over the last few 
days, suggesting the embattled president's forces are attempting 
new ways to stop opposition fighters.

The missiles were fired from the city of Damascus towards northern Syria on the same day
that more than 100 countries recognised a
new Syrian opposition coalition.

The political move will further alienate Assad's 
regime and will allow more humanitarian assistance to be given to the 
forces battling to oust him.

The
bloody battle in Syria has already resulted in 40,000 deaths and the 
conflict has threatened political stability in the Middle East.

The U.S. official who revealed the missile use said there was no indication
that chemical weapons were aboard the missiles.

There had been fears
over the past week that rebel advances were prompting Assad 
to consider using chemical weapons.

The official said that more than six missiles had been fired so far - believed to be scud missiles.

Scuds are most often used as a defensive weapon and were often employed by Saddam Hussein's forces during the Persian Gulf War.

Meanwhile, Russia's foreign ministry has denied reports that a top diplomat said Syrian president Bashar Assad is losing control of his country.

It said in a statement today that deputy foreign minister Mikhail Bogdanov 'has not made any statements or special interviews recently' on Syria but was simply citing the stance of the Syrian opposition while giving a speech yesterday.

Russian state-owned news agencies had quoted Mr Bogdanov as saying that rebels might win the civil war, a comment that appeared to dramatically shift Russia's stance on Syria.

The US later commended Russia for 'waking up to the reality' by acknowledging the regime's impending fall.

Analysts viewed the diplomat's statement as Russia's attempt to begin positioning itself for Assad's eventual defeat.
