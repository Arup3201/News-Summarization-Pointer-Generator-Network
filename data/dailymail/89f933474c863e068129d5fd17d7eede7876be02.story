TV legend Barbara Walters today reassured fans that she is recovering following an accident at the British ambassador's home in Washington - as she continues to be treated in hospital for a fever.

The 83-year-old news veteran issued a statement that was read out by her co-host Whoopi Goldberg on The View, and said: ''First and foremost, I want to thank all
the people who have called, written and been concerned about me. I am 
most appreciative.

'I'm running a low grade fever and the 
doctors are keeping me in the hospital until my temperature is normal. 
I'm pleased to say that it is going in the right direction and I will be
home soon.'

Miss Walters was admitted to hospital in Washington D.C. after she tripped over a step at the residence of Sir Peter Westmacott and cut her forehead on Saturday.

Today, Whoopi, 57, told concerned viewers: 'Barbara went to Washington to cover the inauguration.

'She missed a step and had a fall, which cut her upper temple.

'The doctors stitched her up and she is doing fine, but they want her to take it easy.'

Miss Walters was taken to hospital 'out of an abundance of caution,’ according to ABC News’ spokesman.

And yesterday, an ABC source told MailOnline: 'Barbara's doing fine, she's still under observation at hospital in Washington.'

The journalist, who remains evergreen, was in Washington to cover the second inauguration of President Barack Obama.

However, she tripped over a step at the residence of Britain’s U.S. ambassador, Sir Peter Westmacott.

ABC spokesman Jeffrey Schneider said that 'out of an 
abundance of caution,' Miss Walters was taken to a hospital to get the cut
treated and to receive a full examination.

It remains unclear as to when Miss Walters will be released from hospital.

He fellow View co-star Joy Behar tweeted: 'Wishing @BarbaraJWalters a speedy recovery! Get well soon Barbara!'

Mr Schneider added that Ms Walters is alert 'and telling everyone what to do,' which is 'a very positive sign.'

It's unclear when Ms Walters might be released from the hospital.

Diane Sawyer and George Stephanopoulos yesterday anchored the day’s events for the network.

Miss Walters was TV news' first female superstar, making headlines in 1976 as a network anchor with an unprecedented $1 million annual salary.

During more than three decades at ABC, and before that at NBC, her exclusive interviews with rulers, royalty and entertainers have brought her celebrity status.

In 1997, she created 'The View,' a live weekday talk show that became an unexpected hit.

Miss Walters had heart surgery in May 2010 but returned to active duty on 'The View' that September, declaring, 'I'm fine!'

Even in her ninth decade, the ever-active star continues to keep a busy schedule, including appearances on 'The View,' prime-time interviews and her annual special, '10 Most Fascinating People.'

During last December's special, she asked New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie if he considered himself fit enough to be president someday. (Gov. Christie, although acknowledging he is 'more than a little' overweight, replied he would be up to the job.)
