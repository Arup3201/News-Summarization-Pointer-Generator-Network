A coroner has blasted medics for "serious, repeated and systemic failures" which led to the death of a pensioner from kidney failure.

Stewart Maltby, 64, was not given any fluids for 14 hours after a string of delays in his treatment - including a four hour wait for an ambulance to take him to hospital.

An inquest at Nottingham Council House on Tuesday heard how a catalogue of errors by 36 medical staff contributed to Mr Maltby's death on November 7, 2012.

Two days before he died, his GP Dr John Porter visited him at his home in Farnsfield, Nottinghamshire, after he complained of being dehydrated and suffering from diarrhoea.

Dr Porter called East Midlands Ambulance Service at 1.53pm on November 5 and told the operator Mr Maltby, who had previously suffered a stroke, required IV fluids when he arrived at hospital.

But the ambulance failed to arrive so the GP dialled 999 saying it was an emergency but the ailing pensioner was not picked up until 6.19pm because of a mistake by the dispatcher logging the call properly.

When he finally arrived at the Queen's Medical Centre (QMC) in Nottingham, he was taken to a ward but further delays meant he did not have fluids until 3.50am the next day.

Kidney failure happens when the kidneys encounter difficulty removing salt, water and waste products from the bloodstream.

When this occurs, waste products will accumulate and can reach dangerous levels and cause an imbalance in the blood's chemical makeup.

Acute renal failure can come on within days or even a matter of hours.

Symptoms include tiredness, passing only a small amount of urine or urine being discoloured.

Acute failure can be fatal and requires treatment.

One course of treatment is to ensure that the correct fluids are introduced to the body and ensuring the amount of salts and minerals remain at the correct levels while the kidneys recover.

Even when he was given IV fluids he 
was not given the correct dose which meant he received just two litres 
within 24 hours instead of the recommended five litres.

Mr Maltby died the next day on November 7 after suffering kidney failure.

Both the QMC and East Midlands Ambulance Service have apologised to the family.

Recording
 a narrative verdict, Assistant Coroner Jane Gillespie condemned medical
 staff who treated Mr Maltby - branding them "oblivious" to his care 
needs.

She said: "These 
failures were far-reaching and impacted on all aspects of his care, from
 basic observations and recordings, to a delay in the escalation of his 
care and a failure to review his condition by an appropriately senior 
doctor when necessary.

"All the while, Mr Maltby's condition continued to deteriorate and those caring for him were oblivious to the same.

"During
 the period of his admission, there were several missed opportunities 
when the correct treatment plan could and should have been pursued.

"I find that had this been so, the outcome may have been different."

Speaking after the inquest, Mr Maltby's family blasted the medics who failed to care for their father.

A
 statement read: "It is clear that the initial reply from the ambulance 
service to our complaint about the delayed response to the call for an 
ambulance that they were 'very busy' was simply paying lip service to 
their initial failings in this unfortunate and distressing series of 
events.

"In his short and tragic time at the QMC, Stewart was dealt with by around 36 people.

"Some
 were clearly shown by the inquest to be hard-working, dedicated 
individuals struggling in a highly-pressured environment with little 
support from management despite direct and repeated requests for 
additional assistance.

"Stewart was a character who made us laugh with his mischievous sense of humour.

"He
 spent a lot of time caring for others, often to his own detriment. 
Eighteen months on he is still very much missed by us all."

Peter
 Homa, chief executive of Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust, 
said: "We extend our condolences and reiterate our unreserved apologies 
to Mr Maltby's family for the failings in our care and for letting them 
and their father down so badly.

"The absence of regular clinical 
observations, handovers between staff and failure to administer fluids 
appropriately meant Mr Maltby's rapidly deteriorating condition was not 
acted upon as it should have been.

"We have learnt from this sad and tragic case and made changes to improve safety and outcomes for our future patients."

A
 spokesman from the ambulance service added: "The service we provided to
 Mr Maltby fell short of the high standard our patients should expect, 
and we are very sorry about that.

"We have since initiated a number of 
changes and issued guidance to all control staff to ensure that the same
 error can't be made when entering bookings in future."
