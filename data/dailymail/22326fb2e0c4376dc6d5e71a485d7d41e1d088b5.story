Tragedy: Rebecca Thompson, 11, may have lain dead for 12 hours before she was discovered by her mother

The father of an 11-year-old girl found strangled at her home appeared in court today charged with her murder.

Simon Thompson, 52, from Hertfordshire, is accused of killing his daughter Rebecca Thompson at the home they shared two weeks ago.

Her body was discovered by her mother Mary, who works selling programmes at Watford Football Club, when she returned to the house, at around midday on Saturday June 22.

Thompson, who works from home, had crashed his VW Golf into trees on a roundabout at high speed around 12 hours earlier.

Doctors allowed detectives to question the man, who had been under police guard in hospital, for the first time yesterday.

Thompson was in a wheelchair when he appeared before Hatfield Magistrates Court today, his left hand was in a cast and his legs were bandaged.

He made no plea and the case was sent to St Albans Crown Court, where he is now due to appear on Tuesday.

Rebecca Thompson was found dead 12 hours after her father was cut free from
his car following a high speed crash.

Rebecca, who had just completed her 
SAT exams before preparing to move to secondary school, is believed to 
have lain dead in the house in Bushey, Hertfordshire, for several hours.

Rebecca's headteacher paid tribute to the 'lovely' and 'hard-working' schoolgirl in the wake of the tragedy.

Rebecca's father Simon Thompson was seriously injured when his car crashed at high speed in Elstree. He will appear in court tomorrow

Rebecca, 11, was found murdered in her home in Bushey, Hertfordshire at about lunchtime on Sunday 23 June

In a statement, Rita Cooper, head of
Sacred Heart Primary School, said: 'It is with great sadness that we 
heard of the death of Rebecca.

'Rebecca was a lovely girl who was hard-working and did well in her learning.

'She was looking forward to secondary school.

'The whole school is very distressed by this tragedy and our thoughts are with her family and friends.'

Floral tributes were left outside the 
schoolgirl’s home as scenes of crime officers examined the three-bedroom property.

Her father’s grey Volkswagen car was wrecked in the high speed crash.

Firefighters had to cut him out of the
car. He was understood to have suffered serious leg injuries. No one 
else was in the car when it crashed.

Neighbours described the family as
private and said Rebecca was only seen in the company of her parents and never 
played outside with the other children in the street.

Another neighbour said of Simon and 
Rebecca Thompson: 'You used to see him with her. He used to take his 
daughter for walks up to the shops.

'It was just him, within the last six-to-eight months.'

Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and 
Hertfordshire Major Crime Unit launched a major crime inquiry and 
appealed for information about where Rebecca’s had been and who she had 
been with on the Friday leading up to her death.

Detective Inspector John Arthur said: 'This is a very important element to this investigation.'

Rita Cooper, headteacher of Sacred Heart Primary School in Bushey, said the schoolgirl was hardworking and lovely
