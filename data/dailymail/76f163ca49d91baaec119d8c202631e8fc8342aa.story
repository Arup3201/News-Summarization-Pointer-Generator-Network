Seven people were killed when a military helicopter that was rescuing a desperately sick baby crashed in Serbia.

Official said that the helicopter was evacuating a five-day old child with life-threatening respiratory problems from the south of the country when it crashed near Belgrade. 

The helicopter had been sent to save the new-born after the ambulance transporting the baby to an emergency hospital in Belgrade got stuck by a landslide blocking the road.

The military said all contact with the aircraft was lost at 10.30pm on Friday after it apparently tried to make an emergency landing while running out of fuel near the airport. 

Serbia's state TV said the Russian-made MI-17 transport helicopter had four crew members and two medical workers on board as well as the sick child. 

The defence ministry said no-one survived the crash that happened late on Friday night near Belgrade's international airport, approximately 18 miles west of the capital. 

The crash occurred in dense foggy weather, which had caused several commercial flights to be rerouted to other destinations.  

Floodlights at two of Belgrade's biggest soccer stadiums were lit to help the pilots to find a spot to land.

Serbia's Defence Minister Bratislav Gasic said the helicopter was the only one in the army with advanced medevac equipment and described the dead pilots as two of 'the best' the army had.

According to military officials, the pilot was among the most experienced in the Serbian army, with more than 4,000 hours of flight. 

Helicopter unit commander Predrag Bandic said: 'The weather conditions were complex but nothing that such an experienced crew in a helicopter equipped as this one could not handle.

'The crew was the best that the Serbian army had to offer for this task, (and) the helicopter was fully functional before taking off.'

Aleksandar Vucic, the country's Prime Minister, called for a day of mourning and offered condolences to the families of the victims.

Soldiers were today seen guarding the site on the outskirts of Belgrade.
