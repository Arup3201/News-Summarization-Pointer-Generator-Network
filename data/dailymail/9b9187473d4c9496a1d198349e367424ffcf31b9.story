They may be one of the world's favourite pets, but it appears not everyone loves looking after cats - after five tiny kittens were found abandoned in a battered suitcase, with one stuck in the zip.

The adorable nine-week-old cats were discovered In Cardiff when a passer-by opened the suitcase - and saw the five sets of eyes staring up at him. 

One  had been stuck in the zip, another had a sore right eye and all five had dirty fur and fleas, but they were otherwise in a healthy condition.

Purrked up: Five adorable kittens have been saved from a suitcase in a Cardiff back street

Ouch: One of the cute little cats was stuck in the zip and another had a sore right eye

The kittens are mostly white and have black and ginger markings. Three are male and two are female.

They were found dumped on Clive Street in Grangetown, Cardiff, and the RSPCA are appealing for any information on the moggies.

RSPCA animal collection officer Rachel Chapman said: 'They are lovely kittens. It is just so sad that someone has just left them.

Saved: The RSPCA will make the kittens available for re-homing if the original owners do not come forward

Cute: There are three males and two females. All are mostly white with ginger and black markings

Help: Anyone with information about this incident should contact the RSPCA on 0300 1234 999

'We would rather the person called us first instead of just being irresponsible and abandoning their pets.

'The cats have been placed into our care and will be made available for re-homing if the owners do not come forward.'
