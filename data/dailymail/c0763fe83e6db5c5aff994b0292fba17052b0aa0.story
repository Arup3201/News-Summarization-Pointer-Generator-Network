Militants have forced a college to drop its ban on students wearing full facial veils.

The U-turn came in the face of a planned mass demonstration against ‘Islamophobia’ and an online petition signed by 9,000.

The niqab ban had been in place at Birmingham Metropolitan College for eight years without protest. But an anonymous prospective student complained to her local paper, saying she was being discriminated against.

When the story broke it sparked claims of racism and even rumours that the college was planning to ban prayer on its premises.

Late
 on Thursday, the college climbed down and ‘modified’ the ruling against
 veils, hoodies and hats, which had been brought in to ensure students 
were always ‘easily identifiable’.

Aaron Kiely, the left-wing 
student activist who organised the 9,000-name petition, is best known 
for opposing the extradition of hate preacher Abu Hamza.

He was 
also forced to apologise for defending the London rioters of 2009 and 
has suggested the police are institutionally racist.

Last night 
Tory MP Philip Hollobone, who is championing a law to ban face coverings
 in public, said he was sorry the college had ‘caved in’.

And 
Downing Street stepped in to the row to reveal that David Cameron would 
back a ban on Muslim veils at his children’s school. The Prime Minister 
is being pressured to give headteachers more protection against similar 
backlashes.

The college, which is the third largest in the UK, with 44,000 students, insisted the policy was designed to protect students.

It
 stopped female Muslim pupils from wearing the niqab, the full facial 
veil in which only the eyes are visible, or the burqa where the eye area
 is covered in mesh.

The policy was attacked by local councillors, MPs and the NUS Black Students’ Campaign, headed by Mr Kiely.

Mr Cameron had backed the college’s original decision to enforce the uniform code.

But
 Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg admitted on Thursday he was ‘uneasy’ 
about the ban and believed the bar had to be set ‘very high’ to justify 
any prohibition on wearing a veil.

More than 800 people were 
expected to attend a protest yesterday, however late on Thursday night 
the college posted a statement on its Facebook page.

It said 
teachers were concerned that media attention was ‘detracting from our 
core mission of providing high quality learning’. It added: ‘As a 
consequence, we will modify our policies to allow individuals to wear 
specific items of personal clothing to reflect their cultural values.

‘The
 college will still need to be able to confirm an individual’s identity 
in order to maintain safeguarding and security.’ The college said it was
 confident this would ‘meet the needs of all of our learners and 
stakeholders’.

Mr Kiely, 24, yesterday thanked supporters, adding:
 ‘We can’t be complacent though as Prime Minister David Cameron 
signalled that he supported the college’s decision to ban students from 
wearing veils.

‘That is why we must always be ready to unite 
together to defend our fundamental human rights to freedom of thought, 
conscience, religion and cultural expression.’

However, Mr Cameron’s spokesman said the Government would defend the right of headteachers to decide on school uniform.

He
 added: ‘There’s an important point here around headteachers and their 
leadership teams being able to take the decisions that are right for 
their schools and we will continue to support that. It’s a very 
important principle.’

When asked if Mr Cameron would be happy to 
see a ban on the veil in his children’s schools, he replied: ‘That would
 apply to every school, every single one, including the ones that his 
children may attend. What’s important is to back the right of schools to
 set their own uniform policy and that’s what the Government will keep 
doing.’

Mr Cameron’s nine-year-old daughter Nancy, and 
seven-year-old son Arthur, attend a Church of England junior school in 
West London.

In a key 2007 case, a High Court judge rejected a bid by a pupil to be allowed to wear the niqab in class.

Afterwards,
 the Department for Education issued guidance that enabled headteachers 
to ban full-face veils on grounds of security, safety or learning.

Mr
 Hollobone, who refuses to meet constituents who wear the veil, said 
stronger guidelines need to be introduced to help schools.

 to enforce uniform rules but Nick Clegg said he felt 'uneasy' about 
telling people what they should wear

‘The 
Government should republish them,’ he added. ‘The shame is that this 
school have done a U-turn when their original decision would have been 
roundly supported by most people who read the Mail.

‘I recently 
read about a teacher who sent home those pupils who were not dressed 
properly. That’s the kind of robust leadership we need in our schools.’

Birmingham
 Metropolitan College is believed to be the only college in the UK to 
have banned the niqab. Some 43 per cent of its students come from ethnic
 groups that are non-white. Of these, 14 per cent are from Muslim 
Pakistan.

This week, the college refused to be drawn into 
discussion on why the ban was introduced, but one student’s story is 
that it was brought in after a group wearing niqabs entered the college 
and attacked a pupil.

The 17-year-old who started the protest told the Birmingham Mail the veil ban was ‘disgusting’.

She
 added: ‘It’s a personal choice and I find it absolutely shocking that 
this has been brought in at a college in Birmingham city centre when the
 city is so multicultural and so many of the students are Muslim.

‘It
 upsets me that we are being discriminated against. I don’t think my 
niqab prevents me from studying or communicating with anyone.’

Tension
 quickly spread across the college’s eight campuses. A group of white 
male students at one of the sites said they were worried. ‘This is 
causing tension, not just with the Muslim girls, but with the boys too,’
 said one.

‘The lads are proud to be Muslim and feel this is discrimination against the girls. The situation is getting out of hand.’

But
 one of his friends said: ‘I support the ban. I have no problem with 
people of other cultures coming to this country – I just think they 
should play by our rules.’

Another young man said: ‘How would people like it if I came into college wearing a balaclava?’

Mr
 Kiely lives in Thurrock, Essex, where he is a local councillor as well 
as being the full-time black students’ officer for the National Union of
 Students on £20,000 a year.

Case by case: Schools can outlaw veils but only after a consultation

Headteachers have the power to order students to remove veils after a series of high profile legal cases.

In a key 2007 case, a High Court judge rejected a bid by a pupil to be allowed to wear the niqab in class.

Although the 12-year-old’s three older sisters had worn the headwear at the same school in Buckinghamshire, teachers said it impeded their ability to communicate with her.

They said they needed to be able to tell if a pupil was paying attention, engaged with her work or distressed.

After the case, the Government issued guidance that enabled headteachers to ban full-face veils on grounds of security, safety or learning.

It said teachers were justified in enforcing uniform rules which mean they can see and make eye contact with pupils.

Schools need to be able to identify pupils to maintain order in classrooms and to spot any intruders, it added.

But rather than a French-style blanket ban on face coverings in all public spaces, the Department of Education said institutions could outlaw the coverings as long as they carried out a proper consultation.

Updated Government guidance released last year clearly continues to back heads who choose to ban face-coverings.

It says it is ‘still lawful’ to restrict the freedom of pupils to express their religion on the grounds of ‘health, safety and the protection of the rights and freedoms of others’.

And religious freedoms do not mean pupils can practise their beliefs ‘at any time, in any place, or in any particular manner,’ the  guidance adds.
