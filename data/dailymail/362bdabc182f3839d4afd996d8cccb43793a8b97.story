Charlie Lee, 19, tricked his vulnerable victim out of tens of thousands of pounds

A teenage conman was jailed for tricking a grandfather out of almost £50,000 for fake home repairs.  

Charlie Lee, 19, had followed his vulnerable victim home and claimed he needed tens of thousands worth of work to fix a crack in his home's foundations.

A court heard Lee and his 17-year-old accomplice even sent a fake solicitor's letter demanding more and more cash from the man, 61.

A judge told the baby faced pair that they had acted like 'hardened criminals' during the con.

Judge Gregg Bull QC: 'It was planned and persistent.

'The victim was cajoled and threatened to give money. It is the thinking of hardened criminals.'

Lee had spotted the 'lonely and vulnerable' man, who would not be named for fear of further scams, walking home from work.

The conman noticed the victim stumble and decided to target him and follow him home, the court heard.

Lee and his 17-year-old accomplice, who cannot be named for legal reasons, stopped the car and 'saw they could take advantage'.

They offered to do some work on the roof at his home in Monmouth, South Wales, then pressed him to hand over more and more money.

Newport Crown Court heard how their victim handed over £47,000 for just £2,200 worth of repairs during a three week period.

Lee, who lives on a caravan site in Northampton, was jailed for 19 months and the 17-year-old received 18 months in a young offenders institute.

Gwent Police DC Mark Price said: 'This was an incident where two people took extreme advantage of a someone's vulnerability to con them out of a significant amount of money.

'This kind of crime is dealt with robustly and we will continue the work we do locally to raise awareness of rogue trader activity and promote steps members of the public can take to better protect themselves, family members and their neighbours.'

The scam comes on the eve of major government reforms  that will hand millions the chance to cash in their pension pots – giving them access to huge sums previously locked away.

On April 6 over-55s will be allowed to cash in all or part of their pension but the shake up has renewed fears it could trigger a flood of scams on the elderly and vulnerable whose newly-available funds will be rich pickings.
