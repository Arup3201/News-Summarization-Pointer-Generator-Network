The eating habits of Scots have long been the subject of both ridicule and grave concern.

The nation that gave the world such culinary obscenities as the deep-fried Mars Bar and the pizza fritter has one of the highest levels of obesity in the world.

Now a study has found that one in five Scottish people believe that jam constitutes one of their recommended five-a-day servings of fruit and vegetables, despite it containing more than two-thirds sugar.

Healthy eating? A worrying one in five Scottish people believe that jam constitutes one of their five-a-day

The study was conducted for the Food Standards Agency which has long been attempting to educate people north of the border about the importance of healthy eating.

Agency spokesperson Dr Jacqui McElhiney, told the Sunday Times: 'Clearly we still have work to do.' 

Latest figures have revealed 41 per cent of Scottish men are overweight and more than half of those are obese.

The figures are only slightly better for women with 32 per cent classed as overweight and 23.5 per cent as obese.

Of perhaps even greater concern, one in six boys aged between two and four are obese.

Scotland has the third worst obesity levels in the world behind Mexico and America.

A spokesman for the Scottish Government said: 'we are investing more than £7.5 million between 2012 and 2015 on projects to encourage healthy eating.'
