A British woman was shot dead by her future brother-in-law in an apparent murder-suicide in Tennessee after a row over a Christmas present dramatically escalated.

Kayleigh Dupont, who was originally from Essex but had moved to the U.S., was found dead on Thursday at an address in Village Lakes Apartments in an upstairs bathroom along with her future brother-in-law Justin Bennett, 32.

Her two-year-old son Jacoby was found unharmed walking around in the apartment.

Murder-suicide: Kayleigh's future brother-in-law Justin Bennett was also found shot dead and police believe he committed suicide after killing her. He posted a picture of a recently acquired gun on his Facebook page in October

Authorities believe the death stemmed from a fight between Kayleigh and her fiance Jason Bennett's father Timothy who lived with the couple in the apartment along with 'several others'.

According to Timothy Bennett, Dupont became mad when her son's train set broke.

'So what - it's just a toy,' Timothy Bennett told WSMV.

The fight reportedly got physical and Kayleigh told police that Timothy choked her, so she took out a restraining order against her future father-in-law on January 14.

Family feud: Kayleigh had recently gotten into an argument with her future father-in-law Timothy Bennett (left), who lives with the couple and their child. Apparently he choked her after she complained about a broken Christmas toy - leading her to take out a retraining order against him

Obsessed: Authorities say Justin Bennett became 'consumed' by Kayleigh filling out a restraining order against his father and that's what led him to kill her

Timothy was arrested for domestic assault and he was ordered to stay away from the home he lived in.Â 

Authorities believe that Justin became 'consumed' over Kayleigh's retraining order and that's what led him to kick down the door of her apartment Thursday night.

Kayleigh's fiance Jason was out of town on business in Kentucky at the time, but has since returned to take care of Jacoby, according to Kayleigh's brother, who lives in England.

Paying tribute to her daughter Kathleen Donoghue, 48, of Harlow, Essex, said: 'She never had an enemy in her life.

'We told her she should come home. I spoke to her an hour before it happened. I prayed for her that night.

'Kayleigh worked so hard all her life. She didn't want to come back and she was so happy with Jason her fiance. But she had her life cruelly snatched away.

'She was a beautiful soul taken in a senseless act. I am brokenhearted that someone has taken my only daughter away from me.

'She was looking forward to marrying Jason and looking after her son Jacoby.

'Jacoby and her family were her number one priority. I spoke to her everyday. She was a fantastic mum and we miss her so much.'

Kayleigh's brother also mourned her loss on 
Facebook, writing: 'My sister was a beautiful lady and Jason treated her
 really good. He [was] such a good man and proud to say he [is] part of 
my family. I will miss my sister so so much. She was my only sister.'

Smyrna Police Chief Kevin Arnold was heartbroken to see the toddler taken out of the apartment after losing his mother.

'When they brought that child out last night, and here is this 2-year-old with a pacifier in his mouth, and to think that his life is impacted forever, just over something stupid and silly,' Chief Arnold said.
