When Quassia vom Wandsbarg went into labour, her owners were ready to welcome eight or nine more Irish Red Setters into their home.

But nothing prepared them for this.

By the tenth, they were pleasantly surprised.

Unexpected: Four-year-old Irish red setter Quassia vom Wandsbarg gave birth to 17 puppies in her first litter

Adorable: Quassia's owners were only preparing to welcome about eight or nine new puppies into their home

After 11, they were gaping at each other in shock.

But that was nothing yet.

Hours later they sat - exhausted, baffled and ecstatic - marvelling at the sight of a 17-strong litter.

New family: 15 of the 17 born on November 1 in Germany survived and will now be cared for until March

Care: The puppies will now need to be fed by their mother for four months four times a day

Almost a record: Quassia's litter is just shy of the record, set in 2004 by Neopolitan mastiff Tia who had 24

Lively: Irish Red Setters are known for being lively, playful, energetic, companionable, and affectionate

It is just shy of the world record set in 2004 by Neopolitan mastiff Tia, from Cambridgeshire, who had a caesarean section to deliver 24.

The family, from Germany, will now care for the 15 surviving puppies before they are strong enough to be re-homed in about four months.

Popular: The owners will have no trouble selling these sleek-coated red puppies, ideal for dog shows

It was Quassia's first litter and her owner are preparing for a tough few months caring for her and the babies.

The little ones will have to be fed by their four-year-old mother four times a day.

But when it comes to a sale, the owners will have no trouble finding homes for these sleek-coated puppies, a popular breed for dog shows.
