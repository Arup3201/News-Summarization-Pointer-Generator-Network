A man whose six-month-old baby girl died after being trapped in a car for around six hours at an Intel business parking lot claims he forgot she was there.

The 38-year-old, who has not been identified, was meant to take his child to daycare on the way to work after a doctors appointment yesterday morning.

But instead he simply drove to work at Intel in Oregon and left the baby in her seat, The Oregonian has reported.

Just after 5pm, he returned to the vehicle to find the little girl lifeless and called 911. 

Fire Department spokesman Storm Smith said medics found both mother and father at the scene, with the mother following a 911 operator's instructions on performing CPR.  

Mr Smith says medics took over treatment and an ambulance took the child to Tuality Community Hospital in Hillsboro, where she died.

Lieutenant  Rouches added that the cause of death has not been determined. 

Neither the father nor mother was identified and no arrests have been made.

The father told police that he does not typically drop the baby off at daycare. 

On Thursday, he told officers, he was not operating in his normal routine. 

Detectives are continuing to investigate the case.
