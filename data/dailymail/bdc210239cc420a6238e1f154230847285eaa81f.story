Former X Factor star Cher Lloyd has hit out at music mogul Simon Cowell, saying she couldn’t handle the level of ‘control’.  

It looks like the relationship turned 
sour after the singer refused to give Simon’s label SyCo complete 
control over her career.

Explaining the reasons behind the split, Want You Back singer Cher said: ‘I don't really speak to him anymore. I left his label a year and a half ago and I got my record deal here [America].’

Moving on: Cher Lloyd has split from her record contract with Simon Cowell and is now working with LA Reid

‘I have a specific thing I am reaching for, so I have my own idea of how I'm going to get it ...

'He found me difficult': Cher has opened up about the reasons for the split from Simon's SyCo label

Speaking to Larry King on his US chat show, she added: 'We all have a specific thing in life 
that we want to get to and I don't deal very well with people having 
[control].

'I think he found me - I wouldn't say disobedient - but a little bit [difficult].'

But the singer, who finished fourth in the seventh series of X Factor UK, was adamant she wasn’t angry about the move: ‘I don't think so.

'I mean, I wouldn't say angry - I would like to think he misses me now.’

Cher is now working with LA Reid in America.

It’s not the first time Cher’s had a 
public spat with one of the X Factor judges.

Back in March 2012 Cher 
critisised her former X Factor mentor Cheryl Cole for allegedly not 
singing live during her performances.

Cheeky! Cher is known for her outrageous antics, and poked her tongue out for the cameras at the  Bloomingdale's Glendale cocktail gala  earlier this month

When
 asked on Real Radio North West if she would ever duet with Cole, the 
then-18-year-old said: 'Maybe, if she sings live with me... [it's] 
always [a challenge] nowadays when you haven't got that nifty little 
button to press.'

Cheryl later took to Twitter in an 
apparent attempt to reply to her former mentee saying: ‘Be Careful who 
you kick on your way up ... They kick you twice as hard on your way back
 down.. #unappreciationisugly.’

Cher later apologised to the Fight For This Love singer on television, and nothing more’s been heard about the argument.

MailOnline has contacted representatives for both Cher and SyCo for comment.
