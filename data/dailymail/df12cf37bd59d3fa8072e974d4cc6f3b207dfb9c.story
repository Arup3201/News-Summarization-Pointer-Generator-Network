A frustrated television viewer called 999 because she couldn't find the movie she wanted to watch.

The Sky subscriber dialled the emergency services number to lodge a complaint when she couldn't find a particular film on the channel's movie box service.

Police say this is just one example of numerous ridiculous calls made to 999 which waste operators' time and prevent them from dealing with real emergencies.

Other examples include a concerned mother who called 999 because her daughter's hamster got stuck under the floorboards, while another called because her son’s radio-controlled helicopter had crashed on a nearby shop roof and they needed help to retrieve it.

South Yorkshire Police say up to one-third of the 999 calls they receive should never have been made in the first place.

Superintendent Adrian Moran, the force’s officer in charge of communications said: 'These might sound amusing but there is a serious point to this.

'While we are distracted with answering these calls we are not attending to other more important calls from the public which potentially could put lives at risk and reduce the service we provide and our response to incidents.

'If it is clearly not a police matter do not use us a directory inquiry or advice service. We will and regularly do prosecute callers who repeatedly abuse the 999 system.

'The simple message is you should only call 999 in an emergency when a crime is in progress, a suspect is nearby or life is in danger. For all other matters use the non-emergency number 101.'

Other time-wasting calls the force has received include a neighbour complaining a couple next door were making love loudly with the windows open while a shopper dialled 999 because because a store would not exchange a pair of shoes she had bought.

Another parent even called 999 to ask if police officers could attend her home because her son would not eat his breakfast.

Operators also regularly received drunken phone calls from revellers asking for a taxi home.
