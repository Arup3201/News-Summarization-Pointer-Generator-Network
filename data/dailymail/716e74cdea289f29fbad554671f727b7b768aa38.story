Militant: Unite Union boss Len McCluskey

The bullying tactics used by unions are to be investigated by the Government.

Ministers had wanted to conduct a wider inquiry that would also have scrutinised how businesses behave during disputes, but the TUC refused to take part because it said the review was too political.

The move was prompted by last year’s Grangemouth oil refinery dispute, when company bosses were accused of blacklisting workers’ leaders, and union members intimidated managers and their families.

The Government has now revised the terms of reference and appointed leading lawyer Bruce Carr QC to lead the six-month probe solely into the behaviour  of unions during strikes, looking at the alleged use of extreme tactics, including the so-called ‘leverage’ policy.

It comes after the Daily Mail exposed the intimidation carried out by the Unite union.

During its dispute with Grangemouth owner Ineos, Unite general secretary Len McCluskey sent a ‘leverage team’ to visit bosses’ homes, where they would protest in front of neighbours.

One Ineos director said he had feared for his wife and two young children after 30 protesters arrived at his home, telling his neighbours he was evil.

Another manager said Unite activists had appeared on his drive with flags, banners and an 8ft inflatable rat, adding: ‘They were trying to humiliate me, trying to portray me as a nasty boss, a nasty capitalist.’

Former Labour candidate Jonathan Roberts quit the union in disgust, saying Mr McCluskey was putting the entire union  movement at risk, adding that ‘picketing the family homes of company bosses and intimidating their children’ was not a ‘decent’ way of representing workers.

Mr Carr, who will report to Francis Maude, Minister for the Cabinet Office, and Business Secretary Vince Cable, will also investigate whether the law on union disputes was tough enough.

Mr Maude said: ‘This Government’s long-term economic plan is building a stronger, more competitive economy to secure a better future for Britain.

‘Trade unions can play a constructive role in the modern workplace, but allegations of union industrial intimidation tactics – which include attempts to sabotage business supply chains – are very serious and may be damaging our economy’s competitiveness, which would make our future less secure.

That’s why it’s right to have this review to get to the bottom of these tactics and to determine whether the existing law is effective.’

Frances O’Grady, the TUC general secretary, said: ‘This review may have been announced with great fanfare by the Prime Minister, but the delay in setting it up, the limited terms of reference and the exclusion of the promised consideration of employer behaviour, such as blacklisting, confirms that it was never anything more than a headline grabbing party-political stunt.’
