This is one dog that really doesn't like Christmas.

So when Norman the  bullmastiff's owner begins singing the 12 Days of Christmas, the grumpy dog tries to do anything to make him stop.

This hilarious video shows Curt Kendall  singing the Christmas carol in a high falsetto, as poor Norman attempts to drown it out by whining and barking.

But when that doesn't work, the giant canine refuses to leave his master's side but decides to muffle the awful sound by lying across his owner's face - just as Curt launches into five gold rings.

The clip ends with the owner eventually  giving up the song and giving Norman a kiss.

On his You Tube page, Curt wrote: 'Norman hates Christmas, but he really HATES when I sing. He gets so embarrassed. It's torture for him!

'Merry Christmas from our Bullmastiff Scrooge!!'

Curt, who owns his beloved pet with partner Jason Kasal, had first recorded the video as an alternative to a Christmas card for Jason who was away travelling.

But the animal lover, from Indiana in America, had never expected the reaction the video, which has been seen over 6 million times, would receive.

To celebrate reaching the 1 million mark, Norman even got a cheeseburger.

 On his Facebook page, curt thanked the millions who had watched and shared the clip.

'Thanks for sharing our video! It was just going to be our Christmas card! (Because we are lazy). Me and Norman and Jason have had a lot of fun with this! Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.'

And from the comments, many people seem to side with Norman.

Jaelyn Jackson wrote: 'LOL im with Norman dont sing that was adorable beautiful dog.'

Emma Rose Norman added: 'I share your pain. My husband likes to annoy me with this song too. :)'

While Jarvis Wellington simply asked: 'Why are you torturing that doge?'

Ginette Bourque; This is so funny! Poor Norman, why must he suffer so. LOL ;) 

ScrumRunner: Sounds to me like Norman's trying to sing the alto harmony, and he does just great! Go Norman. 

David Sherman said: 'From this day forward, I will be unable to sing or listen to 'The 12 Days of Christmas' without being delighted in thinking about this video. A true MASTERPIECE!!'
