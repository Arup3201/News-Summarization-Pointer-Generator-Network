Squads of French riot police today smashed up and then bulldozed three illegal camps full of UK-bound migrants in Calais.

There were brief scuffles as the armed officers wearing body armour and carrying plastic shields moved in shortly after 8am.

‘Our orders are to get rid of the tents and order makeshift structures, and to evacuate those living in them,’ said a gendarme officer at the scene.

There was little resistance as the armed officers wearing body armour and carrying plastic shields moved in shortly after 8am, but as the clear-outs continued, there were scuffles between police and a few dozen activists demonstrating against the rough treatment of the migrants

The official reason for the clearance was to prevent an outbreak of the contagious skin disease Scabies from spreading.

But
 local prefect Denis Robin said he also wanted to prevent the creation 
of another ‘Jungle’ – the name of a similar illegal camp bulldozed in 
2009.

Some camp dwellers barricaded themselves into makeshift huts, goading the police massing outside.

Representatives of human rights groups also booed officers as they deployed around the camps.

A bulldozer destroys the immigrant camp in Calais this afternoon

A group of around 20 people who pushed and shoved the police were mainly student activists

But by midday, the litter-strewn camps were being crushed into the ground by bulldozers.

Showers
 and medication were laid on for the hundreds of migrants who lost their
 temporary homes, but there were no arrests, said Mr Robin.

A group of around 20 people who pushed and shoved the police were mainly student activists.

As
 well as the ‘deplorable hygiene’ conditions, Mr Robin said many of the 
migrants were ‘at the mercy of people smugglers’ offering to take them 
to Britain for cash.

There are fears that there will be a repetition of the so-called 'The Jungle', an infamous camp which was destroyed in 2009 after becoming a magnet for migrants

There are currently up to 1000 migrants living rough in Calais, with up to 650 around the port area alone

'Fragile members' of the migrant community, including children, will be allowed temporary accommodation in a holiday camp in the Pas de Calais, while adults can request 'emergency housing'

Mr 
Robin insisted that the clear out would assist the most vulnerable 
migrants, allowing the sick and aged to get emergency health care.

‘Fragile
 members’ of the migrant community, including children, were allowed 
temporary accommodation in a holiday camp in the Pas de Calais, while 
adults can request ‘emergency housing’.

But critics said the migrants will simply be left on the street, without even a roof over their heads.

Aid
 organisations said dozens of migrants had made last ditch attempts to 
get across the Channel over the past few days after being warned of the 
impending police operation.

Border
 guards meanwhile reported dozens of people hiding in shrubs along roads
 leading into the port, with many attempting to jump on lorries as they 
slowed down.

Police move quickly to make sure scuffles do not escalate on the outskirts of the camp

Charity workers helping refugees from wars in Syria and Afghanistan reacted with outrages to the planned clear-out, blaming it on a shift to the far-right in French politics

Representatives of human rights groups also booed the police as they deployed around the camps

Hundreds of people living in squalid conditions has also led to outbreaks of Scabies, a contagious skin condition caused by tiny mites which burrow into the skin, causing severe itching and rashes

A Sudanese 
migrant was killed on Friday after trying to conceal himself under the 
axle of a British coach in a supermarket car park.

Jean-Claude
 Lenoir, of the migrant support group Salam, said: ‘As if the situation 
isn’t tragic enough, these expulsions are leaving immigrants with 
nowhere to go.’

Charity 
workers helping refugees from wars in Syria and Afghanistan also reacted
 with outrage to the planned clear-out, blaming it on a shift to the 
far-right in French politics.

officials as they try to reach Britain in the back of lorries.

Once in the UK they will claim asylum, which entitles them to generous benefits, or disappear into the black economy.

Martine
 Devries, of the international charity Medecins du Monde, said: ‘They’re
 taking advantage of treating people for scabies to destroy the camp. 
It’s a waste of equipment and where are the migrants going to go?”

Mr Devries added: ‘We get the feeling the authorities think once everything is destroyed all this will go away.’

Four
 migrants died in one week alone in March this year. On March 9 an 
Albanian man was killed on a motorway outside the town. Three days 
later, Ethiopian Mesfin Germa was hit by a lorry as he walked to the 
port.

The body of a 
25-year-old Ethiopian man, Senay Berthay, was found in Calais’s  
Batellerie dock on March 14 and the next day a fellow Ethiopian in his 
20s was crushed to death by a car while hiding on a  vehicle 
transporter.

It is thought he had been among a group of three men who got on the truck and then realised it was going in the wrong direction.

Calais
 Mayor Natacha Bouchart has long argued that Britain’s ‘generous welfare
 system’ is the real cause of the migrant crisis in her town.

Referring
 to international treaties governing the treatment of migrants, Ms 
Bouchart said: ‘Calais is a hostage to the British. That's enough. It's 
no longer tenable. It's necessary to renegotiate these accords. We're 
not here to do their job.’

The
 Socialist government of French president Francois Hollande has 
continued the policy of razing illegal migrant camps  on the edge of 
major cities such as Paris and Marseille.

Court orders are regularly obtained for their destruction, with riot police moving in with the bulldozers.
