Tribute: Faurlin has a tattoo of Argentina legend Diego Maradona down his left side

Faurlin, who recently signed a new one-year deal at Loftus Road, told QPR Player: 'I already have one of Maradona on my ribs.

'I made a promise if Argentina win the World Cup, with Messi playing how he is, then I will put one on the other side.

'I will dedicate it to the two best players in history, the Argentinian No 10s and captain.'

Argentina beat West Germany to lift the World Cup in 1986 but suffered heartbreak four years later as the Germans gained revenge on home soil.

But Faurlin is keeping his fingers crossed Messi and Co can deliver on the big stage at the weekend.

'It would be massive for the country,' he added. 'It's been so long since the last one.'
