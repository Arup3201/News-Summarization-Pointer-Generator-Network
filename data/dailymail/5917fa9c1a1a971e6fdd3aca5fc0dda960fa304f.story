An SAS chief responsible for planning  top-secret operations in the Middle East was under armed protection last night after a life-threatening security blunder led to his identity being exposed on  the internet.

The commander met high-ranking officers from a Middle Eastern country earlier this month to discuss joint operations between UK Special Forces and local troops.

During the get-together a photograph was taken of the officers in their desert uniforms. This image and a report of the event should have been vetted by British officials before being released to the  media in the host country. Astonishingly, the leaking of the officer’s name and his role were discovered not by the Ministry of Defence or the Foreign Office but by this newspaper.

Due to his status, the man is considered a prime target for Islamic terrorist groups. The Mail on Sunday’s intervention triggered a tightening of his personal security arrangements.

The MoD also thanked this newspaper for bringing the  matter to its attention and a spokesman insisted that efforts were being made to remove the material from websites.

However, last night the image and the report of the SAS officer’s engagement with military officials remained online, raising the possibility that he may have to be flown back to Britain for his own safety.

A blame-game also started, with Foreign Office sources denying responsibility for the leak, even though the event was staged at a British Embassy.

A source suggested that  regardless of the venue, it was  up to the MoD and not the Foreign Office to put the necessary  security measures in place to protect personnel.

Colonel Richard Kemp underlined the need to be careful with the internet

Military experts suggested the leak could compromise British intelligence-gathering in the  Middle East, in particular with regard to Iran, because foreign security agencies will glean vital information from reading the report.

For security reasons The Mail on Sunday is not naming  the country where the meeting took place.

Colonel Richard Kemp, a former member of COBRA, the Government’s emergency response  committee, said: ‘This incident underlines the need to be more careful because, with the internet, once it’s there, it is there, and it is very hard to do anything  about it.

‘Undoubtedly, anyone who is interested will have noted the report and will continue to do so.

‘I am concerned for the officer’s personal security, and I  trust that the MoD will be taking steps to ensure that this does not  happen again. There is always great sensitivity surrounding  the presence of British Special Forces anywhere in the world, and for this reason a lot of effort is made to try to conceal their identities.’

As the British campaign in Afghanistan draws to a close,  the SAS is seeking to embed  soldiers into the armies of Middle Eastern states in order to provide tactical training and gather  vital information.

A regimental source said:  ‘The focus is on small teams of troops spending weeks and months with local forces, developing their skills and, while they’re there, getting to know  the ground and seeing what the Iranians are up to.

‘But these are supposed to be covert missions, not public relations exercises for local top brass.

‘If they’re too busy pushing photographs and reports of what we’re doing to the state media organisations, without thinking what the potential fall-out could be for the SAS personnel working with them, then lives are going to be put at risk.’

Middle Eastern states such as Bahrain and Saudi Arabia have recently accused Iran of aiding uprisings in their countries.

The invitations from states in the region to the SAS and British intelligence to offer training  and advice is intended to thwart these attempts.

An MoD spokesman said: ‘We have a long-standing policy of not commenting on the work of our Special Forces.’

A Foreign Office spokesman also declined to comment on  the matter.
