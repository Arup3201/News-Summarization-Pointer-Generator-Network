The first facial recognition app for Google's Glass wearable computer has launched - and it claims to be able to spot your perfect date in a crowded room.

It can scan the room, trying to match people with pictures takes from social networking and dating site.

Its makers claim it can even check the sex offenders register before deciding on a match.

The ultimate date finder: A new app for Google Glass can take a picture of a face then scour social networks for the person to see if they are a good match.

For peace of mind the NameTag app will cross-reference photographs against the sex offenders registry

NameTag can spot a face using the camera built into Google Glass.

It then sends this via the wearer's mobile phone to a server and compare it to millions of records.

In seconds, it will return a match complete with a name, additional photos and social media profiles.

FacialNetwork.com, the developer of NameTag, is also currently creating technology to allow the scanning of profile photos from dating sites such as PlentyOfFish.com, OkCupid.com and Match.com.

The technology will also allow users to scan photos against the more than 450,000 entries in the National Sex Offender Registry and other criminal databases.

Called NameTag, it blurs the lines between online and offline dating by allowing smartphone users to simply glance at someone nearby, or take their photo, and instantly see that person's name, occupation and even visit their Facebook, Instagram or Twitter profiles in real-time.

NameTag sends photographs wirelessly to a server, compare it to millions of records and in seconds return a match complete with a name, additional photos and social media profiles.

FacialNetwork.com, the developer of NameTag, is also creating technology to allow the scanning of profile photos from dating sites such as PlentyOfFish.com, OkCupid.com and Match.com.

For added peace of mind, the user can also cross-reference the photos against more than 450,000 entries in the National Sex Offender Registry and other criminal databases.

Keeping it real: NameTag takes online dating offline

NameTag's creator Kevin Alan Tussy said: ‘I believe that this will make online dating and offline social interactions much safer and give us a far better understanding of the people around us.

‘It's much easier to meet interesting new people when we can simply look at someone, see their Facebook, review their LinkedIn page or maybe even see their dating site profile. Often we were interacting with people blindly or not interacting at all. NameTag can change all that.’

NameTag is currently available on Glass for Beta testers – meaning that the developer is letting people outside the company examine how it works to help iron out bugs and glitches.

However, Google will not allow the app to be used for Glass beyond this as it contravenes its privacy rules - and NameTag has not made it clear how it will distribute the app.

Following privacy concerns the firm included a line in its Glass Developer Policies banning any Glass app that uses 'the camera or microphone to cross-reference and immediately present personal information identifying anyone other than the user, including use cases such as facial recognition and voice print.'

Tom Wiggins, Deputy Editor of tech mag Stuff, thinks the app is a good idea, but that users should exercise caution.

He said: 'It could be very handy if you're not afraid of scaring people off with your creepy app.

'It's evidently pretty clever but I think most people would find it quite invasive.

'And isn't the point of dating to find out more about people? This kind of defeats the object.

'In terms of privacy, I assume it's only finding information that you've already put online, so it's not really any more of a risk to privacy than adding photos to Facebook.'
