It's always been Match Of The Day 2's job to be the more rock n' roll version of its Saturday night, big arena counterpart. 

The quirky use of music, voiceovers and graphics likes to play with convention. 

And on Sunday night, they really pushed the boat out by inviting Manchester City's most famous fan-with-a-band to take the middle seat in pundit corner.

Musician and Manchester City fan Noel Gallagher made his first appearance on Match Of The Day 2

In fact, the trio sitting opposite Mark Chapman looked like they could just as easily be about to share their thoughts with us on the latest floor-fillers from the hit parade. 

Jermaine Jenas, to Noel's right, would make a perfectly good ex-boy band member.

While Mark Lawrenson to his left looked like he could be about to take the Bay City Rollers back out on the road again.

But as Chappers pointed out, it was Noel's 'fan's eye view' that he was there for. Which included being filmed on a very successful trip to see his team take Newcastle United apart at The Etihad.

After we'd seen Gallagher leaping about in the stands, Chapman asked him back in the studio if he missed being just in amongst the fans? 

The 47-year-old was in good spirits on the BBC's football highlights programme

'You sign too many autographs', replied Noel, clearly as someone wanting to keep his eye on the action. 

'Although he did add '(there's) champagne in the director's box...and they've got these heated seats.'

Having appeared to be something of the angry and cynical young pop star, Noel seems to have turned into a musician and grown-up who has no trouble keeping a twinkle in his eye nowadays. 

We saw that working well last November in his little Manchester derby-day battle with Gary Neville. And once again here he proved to be insightful, knowledgeable and witty.

He warmed up for his contribution to the show by eulogising 'the Brodge' - better known to you and me as Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers.

Gallagher joked that if he was the referee he'd send Wayne Rooney (right) off before he put his boots on

 'One should never underestimate the Brodge' was Noel's prophetic advise about him and his resurging Liverpool team, before proclaiming 'power to the Brodge!'. 

This he did as part of a theme that he was to pursue throughout the night. Namely, have a pop at United.

Because Gallagher was all about Liverpool staying in the top four, so as to keep Manchester United out of it. 

He then went on to point out, quite reasonably, that managers should take some responsibility in the issue of how to improve refereeing. 

He also said he wouldn't mind having a go on the whistle himself. But mainly, it would seem, because 'Rooney (would) be getting sent off before he put his boots on'. 

He was also quite happy to offer to sit alongside Sir Alex on the show should he be required to do so. I imagine a call was put into the Ferguson household immediately.

There were also a few words to be had about Jose Mourinho, particularly for his 'digging out of referees'. 

But he did still concede that he thought it was going to be Chelsea's title, if only 'by two or three points, though'. Which must have been particularly galling for him. 

Because when Chappers asked him - at the end of a most entertaining programme that he fully contributed to - if seeing his team win the Champions League was his ultimate ambition, Noel pondered for a moment and replied 'if I'm honest, I'd like to win the Premier League more'. Which would be definitely, then, Noel? No, maybe?
