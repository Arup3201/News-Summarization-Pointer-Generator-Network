Balancing on the head of a hungry cormorant after escaping from its jaws, this trout almost managed to survive.

Luck, however, was not on its side and seconds later he was flipped back into the air before being swallowed by the cormorant.

The moment was captured by American photographer Andrew Lee, 52, when he spotted the incident on a trip to Long Beach, California.

Where's he gone? For a split second the trout balanced on top of the cormorant's head as the bird tried to eat it

Got him! The fish however was flipped back into the air before being caught in the bird's jaws once again

Mr Lee, of Irvine, California, said: 'A cormorant came up from his dive with a very big trout in his beak.

'The fish was thrashing around very strongly, and the cormorant was trying hard to hold on to his lunch.

'It was like a dance of two unwilling partners. They both moved up and down furiously and rhythmically.'

As the bird and fish struggled, the cormorant threw the trout up in the air, ready to be swallowed.

The trout, for a split second, ended up on top of the cormorant's head, with the bird wondering where its lunch had gone.

Mr Lee was able to capture the moment from just 50 feet away.

He said: 'Having photographed the cormorants, I learned their hunting and eating behaviours.

'I followed this particular cormorant on his several failed dives, until he came up with a very big trout.

'I trained my camera on him and managed to capture the short five second dance.

Dance: Mr Lee said: 'It was like a dance of two unwilling partners. They both moved up and down furiously and rhythmically'

'When people see these photographs most of their first reactions are "wow!" followed with "how did you do that?".

'Others found the photograph very interesting and wonderfully amusing.

'I believe we should observe, learn, and enjoy natural phenomenal instead of disturbing and destroying the delicate balance of nature.'
