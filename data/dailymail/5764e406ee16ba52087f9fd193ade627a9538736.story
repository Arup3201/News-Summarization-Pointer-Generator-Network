The wife of a suspected jihadist has been cleared of buying supplies to help her husband to carry out terrorist attacks.

Gerri Tahari was accused of using an account on auction website eBay to buy a variety of equipment to send to her husband Rabat, who was fighting in Syria at the head of extremist forces.

However, she was acquitted today after medical reports suggested that she has been suffering from depression.

Cleared: Gerri Tahari was accused of helping fund terror but the charges have now been dropped

The 45-year-old mother of two from Birmingham was first arrested in February this year.

She appeared at Westminster Magistrates' Court in March alongside Moazzam Begg, who spent three years as a prisoner at the  Guantanamo Bay military base.

Mr Begg was accused of providing terrorist training and funding terrorism, but the charges were dropped in October when prosecutors were told he had links with MI5.

Mrs Tahari, had been accused of sending her husband 72 pairs of Wellington boots, gloves, a soup kettle, Russian Cossack-style military hats, sleeping mats, long range walkie-talkies, eye goggles, a fleece, and a balaclava between April 2012 and November last year.

During her initial court hearing, a prosecutor said: 'Rabat Tahari is the defendant's husband, and the prosecution case is he was and remains a Syrian terrorist commander of a rebel group.'

The fighter has apparently lost an eye and been left with permanent damage in his leg through his fighting in the Syrian conflict.

But during a hearing at the Old Bailey today, the court heard that the Crown Prosecution Service would be dropping all charges against Mrs Tahari in the light of medical reports on her.

'We have had time to consider their content and effect,' said prosecutor Brian Altman QC. 'None of what they reveal was known at the time the charging decision was made.

'Now that we have them and having carefully considered their content the view has been taken both by the CPS and law officers that it is no longer in the public interest to continue with her prosecution.

'In the light of that we offer no evidence.'

Judge Nicholas Hilliard QC formally entered a not guilty verdict on the single charge of entering into or becoming concerned with a terrorist funding arrangement.

Mrs Tahari's son, Hemmo Moloud Tahari, 20, was accused of funding Rabat Tahari with his housing benefit before the case against him was dropped in July.
