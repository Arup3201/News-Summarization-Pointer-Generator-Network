Former Southampton chairman Nicola Cortese has warned his old club not to sell any of their young talent while insisting the likes of Luke Shaw wouldn't be leaving this summer if he was still in charge.

Cortese left the club after being slowly forced out by owner Katharina Liebherr, shortly after he had persuaded manager Mauricio Pochettino to stay at Southampton.

Now, with Shaw the subject of a rumoured £27m bid from Manchester United and Adam Lallana looking for a move to Liverpool, Southampton look increasingly likely to lose their young stars who have been so instrumental to their rise through the leagues.

Wrong: Ex-Southampton chairman Nicola Cortese believes the club should not sell their young players

Star: Luke Shaw is a target for Manchester United and could leave Southampton in the summer

Cortese told BBC Sport: 'We created those talents. It was key to keep them.

'You don’t produce them just to sell, otherwise you give away your ambition.'

The 45-year-old Italian was a hugely popular figure at Saints and his departure was felt by all the players in January.

Upon Cortese's resignation, Shaw tweeted: 'Gutted with that news, but would just like to thank Nicola Cortese for everything he has done for me and the club! All the best to him!'

Cortese also believes that the Southampton youngsters will be reluctant to leave the club.

He added: 'I knew the players themselves wanted to stick together because this vision was something they believed in, too. I didn’t see any reason for them to go.

'I didn’t have written offers, but I obviously had phone calls. My answer was that it was not going to happen for at least the next two seasons.

'The other chairmen respected that. Until the day I left, there were no offers.'

Southampton looked to be a club in meltdown on Tuesday as two popular academy coaches were sacked 'for not spending enough time with the plasyers'.

Jason Dodd and Paul Williams were shown the door despite playing key roles in bringing through the likes of Shaw, Clum Chambers, James Ward-Prowse and Sam Gallagher.

United target Shaw took to Twitter to show his displeasure: 'Gutted for doddsy and Willo, helped me a lot in my development over the years, wish them all the best in their carers [sic]'.
