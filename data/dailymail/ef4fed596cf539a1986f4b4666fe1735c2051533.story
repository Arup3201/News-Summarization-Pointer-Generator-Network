Mindfulness is a mental state that can be achieved by focusing on an awareness on the present moment, while calmly acknowledging and accepting one's feelings. 

The practice was  reserved only for 'hippy' and 'bohemian' types, but thanks to stars like Miranda Kerr and Daisy Lowe, it has become synonymous with success, fortune and, quite frankly, all things cool.

Many credit the simple form of meditation with helping them to manage daily life and even land a job - but can it help you lose weight? 

Well, two women certainly think so - and they've even created a diet based around the Buddhist practice.

Making meditation mainstream: Miranda Kerr, left, and Arianna Huffington are both fans of mindfulness - and a new book even credits the practice with helping you lose weight 

Patrizia Collard, a psychotherapist, mindfulness teacher and stress management consultant has teamed up with Helen Stephenson, a mindfulness-based cognitive therapist, to create The Mindfulness Diet. 

The duo claim their new book teaches readers how to tune into their bodies and eat the foods they really need to achieve their ideal weight.

The book blurb reads: 'Mindfulness is the new attitude to living. 

'Taking an attitude of mindful awareness to eating will not only help you appreciate every mouthful, but reward you with a whole new way to eat that banishes any former food issues.

'There is no dieting, calorie-counting or fasting, by simply changing your approach to feeding yourself, you can tune in to your body wisdom and begin to eat less of what you don’t need, while filling up on nourishing foods that help you reach the weight you’ll be happy with for life.'

Chapters include myths and risks of extreme diets, tips on how to recognise your eating habits and understand your real food needs, plus mindfulness meditations, 70 recipes and mindful eating plans.

Patrizia said: 'By not being mindful with our "true hunger", we tend to eat more, when having less could be what is needed. 

'By becoming mindful we develop understanding, and in this process we become more forgiving and kinder to ourselves.'

They promise their approach will help readers 'release themselves from the grip of shame and anger' and 'replace it with understanding'.

They claim mindfulness helps people accept the fact that they cannot change the basic frame of their body but can still find their ideal weight and have a healthy appreciation of their body.

Be mindful: All too often we just grab a sandwich in front of our computer for lunch or eat in front of the TV at night. Sometimes we don't even notice what we have eaten, say nutritionists 

It can also apparently helps you learn what an ideal portion size is.

The pair instruct readers to carry out basic meditation practices like the body scan, which involves closing your eyes and focusing on different areas of the body to engage in a friendly relationship with our physique.

Other practises include analysing your food when preparing, cooking and eating it. 

The book advises users to pay special attention to the ingredients' colour, smell and texture, which heightens the eating experience.

Recipes in the £7.99 book include layered nutty bars and home baked beans for breakfast, roasted peppers with quinoa or falafel pitta pockets for lunch and salmon and bulgar wheat pilaf for dinner.  

As well as writing the book, which goes on sale in January, Patrizia and Helen are developing mindful eating weekend courses that will run in the UK.

So how did mindfulness become so hip and the relaxation method of choice for countless celebrities? 

Miranda Kerr is undoubtedly the postergirl for positive living - she has even penned two self-help books, Treasure Yourself and Empower Yourself, packed with uplifting affirmations, while Daisy Lowe says the practice helps her get through the day.

And it's not just supermodels and fashionistas at it. Arianna Huffington, who established the hugely successful Huffington Post, credits daily mindfulness and meditation for changing her life.

Ministers are even considering introducing lessons in mindfulness. Schools Minister David Laws said evidence suggested the sessions could help boost pupils’ attitudes and motivation. 

But can it be applied to weight loss? Shona Wilkinson, Head Nutritionist at NutriCentre.com, said: 'The mindfulness diet is all about being aware of what you are eating. I love the approach but I think to call it a diet is incorrect.

'Being mindful of what you eat is a great practice to follow. All too often we just grab a sandwich in front of our computer for lunch or eat in front of the TV at night. Sometimes we don’t even notice what we have eaten.'

Inspired by ancient Buddhist meditation, mindfulness courses were developed in the late 1970s by US doctors to combat stress.

The therapies aim to help people live more ‘in the moment’ and spend less time going over past stresses and worrying about future problems.

Techniques include moving the focus of attention around the body and observing sensations that arise – the so-called ‘body scan’.

Others involve concentrating on breathing or completing yoga-style movements and observing sensations in moments of movement and stillness.

Mindfulness is said to help people recognise and overcome negative thoughts while noticing small pleasures around them.

Although some regard it with scepticism, studies appear to show a clinical benefit for treating a range of mental health problems.

Thousands of mindfulness sessions are prescribed to NHS patients every year to help treat anxiety and depression.

Celebrity adherents of the now secular practice include Hollywood actresses Goldie Hawn and Meg Ryan. 

She continued: 'Before you even eat, take time to think about whether you are actually hungry or not. 

'Quite often you aren’t hungry but just eating because the food is there. 

'When you think about why you are eating, you may find out that there are emotional or physical triggers rather than just pure hunger.

'When you do eat, savour every mouthful and take time to eat. Notice the colours and flavours. Give yourself time to really enjoy your food. This will make you aware of what you are eating and also make you eat a bit slower which will help your digestive system cope. 

'Eating slowly also gives your body time to release a hormone called cholecystokinin (CCK). 

'This hormone tells the brain that you are full. It takes time to be released though (usually around 20 minutes) so eating slowly gives the body time to release this hormone therefore resulting you in finishing eating when you are full – not when your plate is empty. 

'Time yourself eating your lunch - I bet it doesn’t take 20 minutes!

'Overall, this is a practice we would encourage but wouldn’t call it a diet.'
