British photographer Terry O'Neill has unveiled a new exhibition of celebrity mothers and daughters, including Jo Wood, Twiggy and Judy Garland, just in time for Mother's Day.

The new collection, Mum: A Snapshot, is led by Jo Wood and daughter Leah, who appear in the exhibition twice thanks to a 1981 shot of the pair on tour with Ronnie Wood and the Rolling Stones.

Capturing the special bond between mother and daughter, the show has been created in homage to the photographer's own late mother, and is free to the public this weekend, at London's White Space gallery.

'I can tell her anything, just about anything, she's always there for me and I love her,' says Leah Wood of mother Jo, pictured here on tour with Ronnie Wood and the Rolling Stones in 1981

'I actually did it in homage to my mother who I never had a chance to thank, because she died when I was young,' Terry O'Neill told This Morning. 

'I never had a chance to thank her, and as you grow older of course you appreciate your mother more.'

He added: 'So I got together this exhibition as a tribute to Mother’s Day.'

Terry has been photographing celebrities for the last 50 years and the new show features both old and new pictures.

A rare gem among the collection, which was created in association with online gift specialist notonthehighstreet.com, is a touching photograph of Liza Minnelli pictured with her mother Judy Garland, in 1963.

Terry said: 'That was when I was 20 years old, I worked on the Daily Sketch, which was a tabloid paper at the time, and I got sent round to photograph Liza Minnelli.

'I go round to this mews house in Belgravia, door opens and it's Judy Garland! 

'We got on well, and she made dinner for me and her daughter too.'

Other subjects in the heart warming collection include Emilia Fox and mother Joanna, Holly Willoughby and her mother Lynn, as well as British icon Twiggy and daughter Carly Lawson. 

Several of the shots which feature in O'Neill's exhibition were originally intended as gifts for the husbands of the women pictured.

The 1980 shot of actress Nanette Newman, photographed with her daughters Sarah Standing and TV presenter Emma Forbes, was blown up by the photographer as a surprise present for the late Bryan Forbes, director of films including The Stepford Wives.

Swedish actress Britt Eckland also commissioned O'Neill to take a picture of herself with newborn baby Victoria in 1965, as a surprise gift for her husband Peter Sellers.

The photographer revealed that the actress was still in a London hospital after giving birth, but looked radiant nonetheless.

Britain's Got Talent judge Alesha Dixon also appears in the exhibition, along with Gloria Hunniford and her late daughter Caron Keating, plus models Jodie and Jemma Kidd with mother Wendy.
