Comparing season one with season two of Brad Goreski's reality TV show is like looking at before and after makeover photos.

It's a Brad Brad World began with Goreski trying to kick-start his styling business. He kept racks of clothes in his garage, worried about money and needed to get his name out there.

The show is now in its second season on Bravo (Wednesday, 10 pm EDT), and the former style director for Rachel Zoe has turned things around. (Goreski was featured on Zoe's Bravo series before landing his own show.)

Stylist's eye: Brad Goreski asesses a rail in an episode of his Bravo show It's a Brad, Brad World

He counts a number of Hollywood 
leading ladies as clients, including Jessica Alba, Rashida Jones, Stacy 
Keibler and Jenna Dewan-Tatum. He's also the head brand stylist for Kate
Spade.

So what does he do for those famous faces?

'It's
a very simple process,' he explained in a recent interview. 'I bring a 
very edited rack, and I know the top five things that (the client) is 
going to like.'

When he dressed Alba for the Golden Globe Awards, 'it was the first dress that we tried on,' Goreski said.

Tough love: Goreski says dressing stars like Stacy Keibler (left) and Jessica Alba (pictured at the Golden Globes, right) is about more than just flattering their egos

'We
tried on maybe three or four after that and were like, "This is it,"' 
he said. 'And I think that is a really good way to work.'

'People aren't hiring me to be a yes man. They have their girlfriends for that'

Goreski, 35, said dressing celebrities is more than feeding their egos.

'People aren't hiring me to be a "yes" man,' he said. 'They have their girlfriends for that.'

He said a stylist has to able to say why something doesn't look great on a client or why it won't be received well.

'You
can't just say "it doesn't look good on you," you have to say this: 
"It's not flattering, the color's off, it won't photograph well from the
side, there's nothing really special about it."'

Not a 'yes' man: Goreski says a stylist has to able to say why something doesn't look great on a client or why it won't be received well

Goreski, well-coiffed and often sporting a bow tie, said he goes for comfort at home, just like everyone else.

'It all comes off as soon as I get home,' he said. 'I love the big, like, basketball sweats... and I only wear vintage T-shirts to bed because I like the superthin ones.

'I have about six that all go on rotation and my boyfriend hates (them.) It's like a woman who wears the same flannel nightie to bed every night. Do you know what I mean? "Not the blue one again, get a new T-shirt, what's the matter with you?"'
