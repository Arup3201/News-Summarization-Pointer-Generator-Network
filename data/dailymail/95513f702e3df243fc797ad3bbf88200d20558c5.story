John Biehn, 39, of Southington, was charged twice on Monday for drink-driving and accused of shoplifting at a Wal-Mart early Tuesday

Playing strictly on the wrong side of the law, a former police officer in Connecticut was arrested three times in the space of 11 hours this week.

John Biehn, 39, of Southington, was charged twice on Monday for drunk-driving and accused of shoplifting at a Wal-Mart early Tuesday.

The string of offenses came after he appeared at Superior Court in Rockville on Monday for a drunken driving charge dating back to July 26.

The Hartford Courant reports that after Biehn was released from the courthouse, he was spotted driving in the wrong lane on Route 83 in Vernon.

Police stopped him in a McDonald's parking lot at around 1:30pm where he failed a sobriety check.

He was released on a $2,500 bail apparently posted by his wife.

But later in the day Biehn was stopped again and charged with the same crime in Wallingford, more than 30 miles away.

Again, he posted $2,500 bond and was released.

However, in the early hours of Tuesday he landed in trouble for a third time when a Wal-Mart in Wallingford called authorities and accused him of stealing a pair of headphones and food valued at $73.

He was charged with sixth-degree larceny and released after posting $5,000 bail. 

Biehn is now due back in Rockville Superior Court for the new drunken-driving charge on December 22. 

His listed number rang unanswered Wednesday seeking comment.

He left the Bridgeport police force after being convicted of reckless endangerment in 2006.

Prosecutors said Biehn went on a drunken rampage at a housing complex in 2004, firing his gun at random and shooting out several windows. 

Three residents testified that Biehn pointed the gun at their heads and tried to shoot them. Others said Biehn fired at them but missed.

He was acquitted of attempted murder and assault and received a suspended sentence.

The city later agreed to pay $48,000 to settle a civil rights lawsuit filed by several residents of the housing complex.
