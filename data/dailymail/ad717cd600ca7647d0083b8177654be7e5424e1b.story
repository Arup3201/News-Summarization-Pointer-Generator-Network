While a soup slurper or sandwich chomper be irritating to most, for 19-year-old Emma Riehl, everyday noises are unbearable. 

She suffers from a rare disease known as misophonia, in which she simply cannot tolerate noises like chewing, swallowing, and breathing.

The neurological condition, which literally means ‘the hatred of sound,’ means that many of its sufferers are forced into a life of quiet solitude.

Hatred of sound: Emma Riehl finds it difficult to go to class because of the distracting noises, which often make her angry

Ms Riehl currently attends university and feels a sharp anxiety any time she has to go to lecture.

‘Immediately after hearing one of my triggers, I become enraged, I become very hot, tingly, anxious,’ she explained in her video diary assigned by ABC News’ 20/20.

‘There are about 25 kids in this class, and five of them have colds, so it’s pretty hard for me to deal with.’

Those who suffer from the affliction are often driven into lives of quiet and solitude, simply because they cannot stand to be around people who make these simple noises.

Triggers: Common noises like typing and texting can trigger misophonia in its sufferers

Help: While there is no cure for misophonia, ear plugs and white noise machines can help

Even the sound of texting and feet hitting flip-flops could send a misophonia sufferer over the edge.

Simple eating noises such as chewing, crunching, sucking, and swallowing can trigger feelings of anxiety and rage in some, while pops in the letter ‘p’ and ‘s’ or fillers such as ‘uh and ‘um’ send others in a blind fury. Even household noises such as plastic bags crinkling or silverware hitting plates can put someone over the edge.

There has been little study into the causes of misophonia, though experts say that the condition worsens at the advent of adolescence.

Neuroscientists Aage R. Moller, who works at the University of Texas at Dallas, told the New York Times last September that there is ‘no known effective treatment,’ though Ms Riehl said she better contains her anger when she exercises frequently and keeps to a schedule.

The Times noted that misophonia is quite different from hyperacusis, which is the over-sensitivity to the loudness of a sound.

While there is no cure for misophonia, many recommend using earplugs to lessen everyday noises.

Noise generators can also help reduce the offending noises.

Those with the condition can also go to behavioural therapy and hypnotherapy, according to Misophonia UK.

ABC will air a special 20/20 investigation on this little-known affliction this Friday at 10pm EST.
