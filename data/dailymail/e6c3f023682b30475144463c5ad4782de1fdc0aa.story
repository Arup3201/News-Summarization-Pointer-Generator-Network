A calf who was left crippled after a freak accident and risked being shot is now back walking again thanks to a pair of custom-made leg braces.

Two-year-old Fawn from Woodstock, New York, apparently fell into a concrete manure pit when she was young and fractured her front left knee. A vet treated the injury but the break got infected.

As a result, the calf  resorted to 'crawling' on her knees and her bones grew into a bent shape. Her previous owner feared she might be euthanized as her range of motion deteriorated.

However, rescue workers from Woodstock Farm Animal Sanctuary went out a limb to get the animal moving again.

Action shot: Fawn the cow who was left crippled after a freak accident and risked being shot is now back walking again thanks to a pair of custom-made leg braces

Source of the problem: The calf from Woodstock, New York, apparently fell into a concrete manure pit when she was young and fractured her front left knee - A vet treated the injury but the break got infected

Fawn underwent surgery last year to get her legs straightened and funds were raised to get special boots made. 

Prices start around $800 per leg support.

After weeks of rehab, the youngster was soon back on her hooves again.

Video footage captured earlier this year shows her embracing the chilly weather and taking a stroll in the snow.

At one point she takes a slide on the ice but she quickly manages to regain balance.

Fawn was primarily bred for milking purposes but now she will live out her days at the animal sanctuary.

As she grows, her leg braces will need changing. 

Workers at Woodstock Farm Animal Sanctuary concluded: 'Throughout her ordeal, Fawn has remained incredibly friendly and affectionate. 

'She just loves people and other animals, and has become her doctor and vet students’ all-time favorite patient!'
