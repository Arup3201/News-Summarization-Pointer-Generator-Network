Celtic hat-trick hero John Guidetti insists he would relish an Old Firm meeting with Rangers in the League Cup semi-finals.

The on-loan Swede took his scoring streak to eight in as many games with two virtuoso free-kicks and a penalty in a 6-0 thrashing of 10-man Partick Thistle on Wednesday night.

Stuart Bannigan’s red card for a reckless challenge on the Swede before half-time teed up a second half procession for the champions.

Looking forward to Saturday evening’s semi-final draw, Guidetti admitted he used to get up early in Sweden to watch Glasgow derbies on television.

Now he wants to sample one for himself.

‘It was fantastic watching those games,’ he said. ‘It’s very spicy. You can see it means a lot and the atmosphere is always amazing – you can even hear it through the television.

‘It is an amazing football match, we all know this.

‘But we need to stay focused because there are four teams left – not just two.

‘We know Hampden Park is going to be an amazing atmosphere whoever we play because Celtic fans always do amazing atmospheres no matter who it is.’

Asked if other players had told him what to expect of facing Rangers, Guidetti insisted: ‘No. I know.

‘As a football player, you know. It is special. I played in the game in Holland, Feyenoord against Ajax.

‘I have probably not played anything like it before because in Holland away fans are not allowed to travel for security reasons.

‘If you play away it’s only their fans and if you play home, it’s only your fans.

‘It would be a fantastic game to be a part of but come Hampden in the semi-final the 11 people standing opposite us are going down. This is how we feel every time we play. We want to win every game.’

Rangers manager Ally McCoist admitted in the wake of his side’s win over St Johnstone that he wanted to avoid his city rivals in the semi-finals, but Guidetti responded: ‘It’s up to the Rangers manager how he feels about playing us. We try to work hard every single training day and improve. We try to get better and listen to what the gaffer has to say.

‘We want to win every game and this Cup. I’m like that with everything - if I play monopoly or cards I want to win. We’ll be up for the semi-final, we’ll be hungry and want to win.

‘I am excited in every game I play for Celtic because it’s an honour to pull the shirt on. There are four good teams left in the Cup and this club deserves trophies so hopefully we can do it.’

English scouts were watching £5million-rated Guidetti although Celtic boss Ronny Deila wants to tie up a permanent deal for the player after he left the pitch to a standing ovation.

Guidetti ducked questions on his future, with Celtic now under pressure to keep him from a fanbase crying out for a new hero.

‘I just try to focus on every game because if I start thinking ahead it’s easy to stop performing and maybe then they won’t want me to stay,’ he said. ‘It’s about performing, doing well.

‘I try to take one game at a time and now I am thinking about Saturday.

‘The grass is not always greener so you don’t have to think about the future, only Saturday.

‘I want to give 100 per cent every game for Celtic.

‘When my agent comes to me and says: “Okay John, this is what’s going to happen” then I listen.

‘I have full trust in the people working with me and the people that help me. That leaves me to do my absolute best just to perform on the pitch.

‘I just want to focus and we’ll see what happens when it happens.

‘I don’t want to speculate. I can’t think: “Oh, in five years I’ll be Real Madrid No 10”.

‘This is not real life. You just have to focus on what’s right now because you never know what the future holds.’
