A host of celebrities have joined forces to pose in Christmas jumpers emblazoned with snowmen, reindeer and even a penguin, to show their support for charity.

This group of kind-hearted celebrities, including Myleene Klass and Mark Wright, have volunteered to show their favourite cosy knits off in public, all in the name of promoting Save The Children's Christmas Jumper Day.

The fundraiser, which takes place on December 12, aims to raise money to help support vulnerable and poverty-stricken children around the world.

Charity appeal: A host of British celebrity favourites, including Myleene Klass, have teamed up to promote Save The Children's Christmas jumper appeal 

Feeling festive: Strictly Come Dancing stars Mark Wright and Frankie Bridge have donned their cosy jumpers to promote the campaign 

Union J, Frankie Bridge and Fearne Cotton are among the festive and charitable celebrities involved in the new campaign.

The children’s charity is asking people across the UK to join the woolly trend to help 'make the world better with a sweater'.

Festive cheer: Boy band Union J, who found fame on the X Factor, add a touch of fun to their charity campaign image

Screen stars: Jess Wright from The Only Is Essex, left, and Made In Chelsea Star Rosie Fortescue are also pledging their support to the cause

The charity are asking people to do this by wearing a Christmas jumper for the day and donating to Save the Children (they are asking grown-ups for a suggested £2 and schools and children for £1 per woolly).

The money raised will help save lives and the charity emphasise how just £2 could pay for potentially life-saving antibiotics to treat three babies with infections.  

So dig out your winter knitwear and join in the fun, just like your favourite celebrities.

Getting involved: Fearne Cotton, who is well known in the industry as a charitable figure, looks cool and Christmassy in her jumper 

How many celebrities can you fit in one campaign? Jon Snow, left, and Paul O'Grady are also supporting the cause, which aims to raise money to help support vulnerable and poverty-stricken children around the world
