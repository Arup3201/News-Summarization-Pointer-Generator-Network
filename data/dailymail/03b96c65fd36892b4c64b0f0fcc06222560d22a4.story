A photographer's exploration of her own insecurities, ideals of beauty and love and intimacy in the form of a series of self-portraits taken over 11 years eventually inspired her to lose 110lb.

The photographs Jen Davis began taking of herself in 2002 have been gathered in a new book, 11 Years, which shows her journey in the form of deeply intimate self-portraits. The images will also go on show at the ClampArt gallery in New York City from Thursday.

It was after her series had received critical acclaim and had been showcased around the world in 2011 that Davis realized that her body had not really changed over the years - and neither had she.

Raw: Davis's self-portraits explore themes intimacy, love, insecurity and loneliness

Accomplished artist: 'A lot of artists use self-portraits to transform into other identities. But my intention was to understand myself better. To articulate myself through the lens,' Davis told Oprah magazine in 2012

Intimate: Davis shot photographs of herself during her daily life

'In ten years, my body hadn't really changed, and I hadn't changed, either,' she told Oprah magazine in 2012 following her surgery.

'The problem was that I was making myself vulnerable only for the camera. What I really wanted was to be vulnerable for another person.'

Davis's first shot was taken when she was an undergraduate at Columbia College in Chicago during spring break.

A clearly uncomfortable Davis sits on a towel on the beach, wearing shots and a top over her swimsuit as friends around her sun themselves in skimpy swimwear.

'I had never really photographed myself but that beach shot made me realize that I had to step in front of the camera,' Davis told the New York Daily News. 'I need to look at myself.'

Posed: Davis took pictures of herself enacting everyday activities and also images such as this one, 'Fantasy' with male models

Change: Davis's portrait series was lauded but she realized when looking at them in 2011 that she hadn't changed since she began the series and decided to change her body

Bold: Davis says that if she'd known her work would be exhibited so extensively she doubts she would have been so open with her self-portraits

The portraits, raw and void of any pretension, are scenes from Davis's everyday life.

In one, she sits on her bed and stares square at the camera, as if trying to look into her own soul.

As the book progresses, Davis introduces male subjects into her self-portraits. She was craving intimacy, she says, but found it only in a camera lens.

She explains, 'In the work what I kept returning to is: What is love? Am I loveable? Can someone find me attractive?'

After her revelation in 2011, Davis underwent lap-band surgery and rapidly lost 110lb.

Societal ideals: Eating in public is often a cause of anxiety for overweight people

Artist: 'I couldn¿t necessarily identify with the idea of someone seeing me as ¿beautiful,¿ but I could accept that the pictures that I created and inhabited were,' Davis says

Body of work: Davis has published her powerful series in a book called 11 Years

At 34 in 
2012 and drastically slimmer, Davis had never had a boyfriend. She 
resumed her self-portraits, even though she felt more exposed than ever 
before.

She felt more beautiful and desirable too - but her subject was matter new and different.

11 Years marks the end of one chapter and the start of a new one in Davis's life, complete with its own joys and challenges.

'My
 sexuality feels tangible for the first time. There's a change in tone. 
Where I once saw an overpowering sadness, I now see confidence,' says 
Davis.
