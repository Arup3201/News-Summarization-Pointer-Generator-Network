A newly unveiled visual map allows anyone in the world to keep a finger on the pulse of Twitter.

Tweetping monitors each of the world's posts on the microblogging site, and identifies them with a small flashes of light on a map of the Earth as they happen.

Under the maps, Tweetping.net divides data by continent, showing the number of tweets, words and characters sent since a user logged into the site.

Tweetping also showcases the latest hashtags in realtime.

The fascinating tracker is the work of Paris-based developer Franck Ernewein, who launched the site several days ago.

The Atlantic's Megan Garber writes: 'The
map reveals Twitter's digital movements through the physical world via 
stark explosions of light - but it reveals just as much through its 
stagnant swaths of darkness.'

The site is already so popular with Twitter users that it is often overloaded with traffic and unavailable.

Ernewein has admitted that Tweetping is hosted on a small server that cannot handle the influx of curious viewers.

Tweetping has debuted amid a firestorm against Twitter over a new video-sharing app that has had some problems with sexually-explicit content.

The ease and lack of restrictions on the service, called Vine, allows for racy users to spread pornography quickly.

As with Twitter, users are able to search the platform by hashtags, so technology commenters began realizing the problem when a quick run of the term porn - or a vast array of more specific sexual tags - immediately produces a host of dirty videos.

This new facet of the service strikes at a potentially perilous point for the company, as they are known to be very firm believers in the freedom of the users.

Twitter debuted in 2006 and is one of the most visited sites on the internet.

Singer Justin Bieber has the most followers of any other Twitter user after he overtook Lady Gaga.
