Nathan Hughes will appear before a Rugby Football Union disciplinary panel on Tuesday following the incident which saw the Wasps forward sent off and Northampton's George North taken off on a stretcher last Friday.

North left the field unconscious after scoring the second of two tries in Saints' 52-30 win, as Hughes was sent off for dangerous play as the Wales wing touched down.

Hughes protested his innocence and now faces a disciplinary panel in London on Tuesday.

A RFU statement read: "Nathan Hughes (Wasps Rugby) will appear before an RFU Disciplinary panel on Tuesday evening (6.30pm) at the London Bloomsbury Holiday Inn, charged with striking with the knee and/or shin, contrary to Law 10.4(a), during Northampton Saints v Wasps RFC on Friday, March 27 in the Aviva Premiership."

North's injury was a worrying sight after he took two blows to the head in Wales' RBS 6 Nations defeat against England last month.

He controversially played on in that game before sitting out Wales' next match against Scotland.
