The family of notorious gangster 'Mad' Frankie Fraser are to sue a hospital for failing to spot his leg was fractured before he died. 

Relatives claim Fraser would have been in 'immense pain' after suffering the fracture and believe if if the injury had been spotted earlier he could still be alive.

Fraser, who allegedly pulled out his victims' teeth with pliers, died at King's College Hospital in London last week after he had to be put in a coma after attempts to operate the fracture. 

His family are now suing the hospital, the Sunday People reported. 

Fraser's son and carer Patrick said: 'They sent him home after ten days of X-rays and bone scans before contacting me to tell me he had a fracture. 

'Even then we had to wait for a proper appointment. 

'The pain he must have been in would have been immense.'

He said the family was keen to take action to ensure a similar incident did not happen to other patients.

The fracture is believed to be related to an injury Fraser suffered when he helped lead riots at Pankhurst Prison in 1969.

Fraser, who was 90 when he died, spent 42 years of his life in prison. 

He was a key member of feared London gangs in the 1960s, taking part in turf wars in the city and being associated with gangsters the Kray twins. The pair were once his biggest rivals. 

Fraser was part of the violent Richardson gang, which was well known in London. 

He was implicated in the Richardson's 'torture trial' where the gang dished out punishments of electric shocks, whipping and burning to disloyal gang members. 

Before this he worked as a bodyguard when it is claimed he attacked his victims with razor blades for £50 a time. 

His life after prison also continued to be colourful as he earned further fame by appearing in several crime dramas in the 1990s.

The notorious gangster was also invited to play several cameo roles in gangland dramas. 

He also launched a one-man show — An Evening With Mad Frankie Fraser — that toured the country, a highlight of which was when he told his audience how he preferred the cat o’nine tails to the birch because it was ‘more manly’.

Fraser became known as 'The Dentist' as he allegedly pulled out the teeth of his rivals with pliers and is pictured in his own one man show in London in 1995 (left(, and after he was arrested in the 1960s (right)

Fraser also managed to get an Asbo in 2011 following a row with a fellow resident at his sheltered housing in Bermondsey, south east London, over his favourite chair.

However it is claims that he used pliers to pull out the teeth of his rivals that earned him such notoriety and the nickname The Dentist.

Fraser had an operation last Saturday and was put into a medically induced coma on Wednesday.He had suffered with Alzheimer's for the last three years. 

A spokesman for King's College Hospital said they were 'aware of the complaint' and that an investigation was currently underway.
