A well-organised sham marriage gang staged fake weddings with eastern European brides so Pakistani men could illegally enter the UK, a court heard.

Czech and Slovak women living in the UK were paid by Rotherham-based Asian organisers to fly out to Pakistan where 'marriages' were arranged with Pakistani nationals.

Supported by false documents, applications for settlement and family permit visas were submitted to the British High Commission in Islamabad by Pakistanis seeking leave to join their 'wives' in the UK, Sheffield Crown Court was told.

Sham: 18 people face jail as they await the sentencing hearing at Sheffield Crown Court over their involvement in a sham marriage gang in Rotherham

As overseas nationals they would have been allowed to stay in the UK as 'husbands' of their spouses who were legitimately resident here as EU citizens.

But suspicions over the growing number of applications in Islamabad led to the ring being smashed and none of the 62 fraudulent visa applications were ever granted.

Prosecutor Sarah Wright said: 'It was a well-run, professional and indeed commercial operation. It was a massive operation over a considerable period of time.'

The phoney weddings included brides posing for photographs with their 'grooms' and pretending they were getting married. The photos were then submitted in support of visa applications along with false documents claiming the women could support their 'husbands' in the UK.

One 25-year-old Czech woman claimed to have been married three times in the space of four months and another 'bride' was found with £1,000 in her handbag when she returned to the UK.

Eighteen defendants are now facing jail when they are sentenced at a later date.

In a series of three trials at Sheffield Crown Court which can only now be reported after restrictions were lifted, seven defendants were found guilty after trials of conspiracy to assist unlawful immigration to the UK between January 1, 2009 and December 31, 2011.

Another 11 defendants pleaded guilty to the same charge.

Two of the alleged main organisers are on the run.

Ms Wright told the court: 'The aim of the conspiracy was to try and enable the applicants to enter the UK unlawfully.

'Some of those involved were sponsors of the false applications ie the alleged spouse or fiancee of the applicant.

'Although some of the sponsors took part in what appear to be wedding ceremonies with the applicants in Pakistan they clearly had no intention of living with them in settled and genuine relationships.

'Their marriages or pretend marriages posing for photographs and pretending they were marrying were undertaken solely for immigration purposes and were therefore sham marriages.'

She said some of the 'brides' never took part in ceremonies but allowed their details to be used, pretending to be the spouse of the applicant.

'The women were part of the conspiracy because they allowed themselves to be put forward as genuine wives of the applicants when clearly they were not,' said Ms Wright.

A total of 62 fraudulent visa applications were linked to 32 addresses in the UK and false documents were traced back to an address in Broom Grove, near Rotherham town centre, the semi-detached home at the time of the organisers, brothers Talib Hussain, 41, and Tariq Mehmood, 27, Rahina Zaman, 32, and Veronika Horvathova, 21. 

Forged documents were also found across the street in a bag in the attic at the home of Mohammed Ramzan, 59, and his wife Musserat Bi, 31. Bi was cleared of conspiracy.

The court heard that Mehmood, of Allan Street, Clifton and Veronika Horvothova, of Lindley Street, St Ann’s, both Rotherham are on the run.

The eighteen defendants are: Nikola Horvathova, 25, of St Anns, Eva Holubova, 19, Peter Pohlodko, 19, and Zuzanna Holubova, 25, all of Eastwood, Kristina Popikova, of Masbrough, Mohammed Ramzan of Rotherham and Aftab Hussain of Tinsley, Sheffield.

Talib Hussain, of Broom, Rahina Zaman, 32, of Clifton, Veronika Pohlodkova, 36, of Grosvenor Road, Michaela Lengyelova, 30, of St Anns, Khalda Ahmed, 45, of Clifton, and Svetlana Krausova, 31, of St Ann’s, all Rotherham; Sabina Khan, 45, and Farah Khan, 43, of Barkerend, Louise Kelly, 26, of Holme Wood, Yasser Nasser, 20, of Holme Wood, all Bradford; and Nadia Qureshi, 27, of Fir Vale, Sheffield.
