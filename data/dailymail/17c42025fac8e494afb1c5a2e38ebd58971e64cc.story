A 4.2-magnitude earthquake shook Guthrie, Oklahoma, on Tuesday morning.

While no injuries have been reported, two local news anchors got quite the scare on air.

KAUT co-hosts Lacey Lett and  Emily Sutton were talking about healthy food options about 7:41am when the studio began to shake.

'Earth quake, we just—wait, it's still going,' Sutton told her viewers.

Massive studio lights are seen shaking back and forth as the excited anchors make awkward chit-chat.

'I'm the person that gets overly-excited about earthquakes,' Sutton told her viewers.

The anchor even launched into a post-earthquake dance.

'I can't even focus because I get way too excited,' Sutton added.

'All right, breathe,' co-anchor Lett told her.

Residents 
and business owners in Guthrie, about 30 miles north of Oklahoma City, 
reported a few broken items but not much in terms of extensive damage, KFOR reported.

'It
 was just like a boom, then 7,000 bottles going "ch-ch-ch-ch-chhhh,"' 
Mark Uselton, who owns a liquor store, told KFOR. 'My heart just 
stopped.'

Uselton lost three bottle of tequila to the earthquake—luckily for him, the cheap kind.

'This
 was a 4.2, 4.3—if we get anything like a 5.0 just get out a mop and a 
rag,' he told KFOR. 'Clean it up and go back to work.'

Lett and Sutton have a minor freakout when the tremor continues to shake lights during their Tuesday morning broadcast

In March, a 4.4-magnitude earthquake rolled through Southern California and also forced news anchors to take cover.

'We're having an earthquake!' exclaimed anchor Chris Schauble as he and co-anchor Megan Henderson dove under their desk.

It was over almost as quickly as it had begun.

But a quick cut to a KTLA correspondent in the field a few miles away revealed he'd felt it, too.

'It was a definite jolt, just one single jolt and I haven't seen the magnitude,' reporter Eric Spillman said.

'But it definitely something we could feel here in downtown.'

Startling: The quake was clearly felt quite strongly in the Hollywood KTLA studios, but no damage was reported
