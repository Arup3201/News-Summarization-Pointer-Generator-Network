Luis Suarez was given reason to smile after scooping a hat-trick of awards at Liverpool's end of season bash on Tuesday night.

The Uruguayan striker was reduced to tears when the Reds blew their titles at Crystal Palace 24 hours earlier after throwing away a 3-0 lead to draw at Selhurst Park.

However, Suarez, who has smashed 31 goals in 35 games this term, was boosted by a trio of prizes after landing the Player of the Year, Supporters' Player of the Year and Goal of the Season for his stunning strike against Norwich.

Skipper Steven Gerrard paid tribute to Suarez and reckons the former Ajax star is the best player he's lined up alongside.

'Luis seems to be cleaning up at the moment,' he said. 'He's won everything and we are lucky to have such a world-class talent like Luis playing here with us and helping us to great things and be successful.

'He is out there by a big distance as the best player I have played with and that is no disrespect to anyone else - there has been some top talent for club and country - but this fella can do the lot. He is different to most footballers.

'I don't have to mention his talent, you can see it out there, and he is a fighter who doesn't give up.

'There is some disappointment looming 
around but if this fella stays around for a few more years I think there
 will be some really big nights.'
