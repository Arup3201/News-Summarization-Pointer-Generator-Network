This starling bit off a little more than he could chew when he tried to scare a woodpecker from a bird feeder.

The starling puffed out his chest and flapped his wings in an attempt to scare his rival away.

But the woodpecker merely looked over before launching its own attack.

Bird attack: This starling got a little more than he bargained for when he tried to take on a woodpecker on a bird feeder

Battle of the birds: The starling tried to scare the other bird away by puffing out his chest and flapping his wings, but the woodpecker merely looked over and launched his own attack

The confrontation came after the cold American winter had driven the Red-bellied Woodpecker to a garden feeder normally used by other birds.

Photographer Dr Peter Allinson was on hand to witness the attack in his garden in Kingsville, Maryland.

Dr Allinson, 64, said: 'It was the battle of the Red-bellied woodpecker and the European Starling, taken in my backyard.

'I have a backyard feeder set up and this year was a particularly cold and snowy one.

'Lots of birds use the feeder on a daily basis. For the past month we have had lots of European starlings trying to monopolise the feeder.

'Earlier this week the red-bellied woodpecker was eating some suet when a starling tried to scare him away to get at the food.

'The woodpecker took one look and responded by attacking the other bird.

'While I did not see any blood and the starling survived, it was quite a show.

'I think you can say he certainly got his point across.'
