There are many odd sports taken up by thrill-seekers looking for that next adrenaline rush, but a new game of Russian roulette using Tasers must surely be one of the most extreme - and bizarre.

The sport sees a group of hardcore pain addicts electrocuting themselves with the weapons, which shoot out two electrical darts through which courses 50,000 volts of electricity.

Pictures show the competitors - many of them shirtless - holding 'guns' to each others heads, or their own heads, before firing them. 

But it seems the fun of the game is not getting shocked, but rather 'surviving' to fight another round.

The game - named Perm, after the Russian city it was invented in - sees people shooting each other, or themselves, with Tasers

Tasers shoot out  10,000 volts of electricity - but players say it is just like being punched

There is only a one-in-seven chance of being electrocuted at the start of the game, as there is only one live cartridge in the seven chambers

Each of the gun-like weapons only has one 'live' cartridge in the barrel of the seven chambers - so there is only a one in seven chance you will end up writhing in pain.

Players claim the shock is a bit like being punched. 

However, if a player 'survives' the first round, a second live cartridge is placed in the gun which doubles the chance of them firing the weapon into their body. 

As each round continues the number of cartridges increases accordingly.

And if people get bored with just shooting just one person, there is the 'Love Triangle' where three players face off against each other

However, the game is still probably a more sensible option than the original version of Russian roulette, which uses actual bullets and comes with a substantial risk of death.

And there is an added bonus for the winner, who gets to take home the 200 roubles - about £2 -each player has paid to take part. 

Very lucky players even win competitions, medals - not to mention the respect of their competitors.

The winners - the last man or woman standing - take home the money collected from the 200 rouble entrance fee

It is said the game was invented by an ex-champion fighter, who wanted to find a new thrill after injury ended his career

The game is named Perm - after the industrial city on the edge of the Ural Mountains where the participants live. 

According to local legend, it was invented by former champion fighter Valery Eschenko, who invented it after realising his days in the ring were over due to an injury. 

However, whether the game is risk free remains to be seen: people suffering from epilepsy are banned from playing in case a shock induces a seizure.

Meanwhile, there are questions in the West - where Tasers are regularly used by police forces - about the safety of the weapons.
