Onwards and upwards: Prime Minister David Cameron is likely to increase interest rates in 2014

Half of pensioners want higher interest rates to counteract the disastrous effect of years of low returns on their savings.

Fifty per cent of the over-60s say a rise in interest rates would make them better off, according to a survey.

By contrast, just 7 per cent say their finances would suffer.

Over all ages, more people think they will benefit from higher interest rates, which is good news for David Cameron as a rate rise becomes more likely in the run-up to the election.

The survey shows that two thirds of people believe an increase would improve their personal finances or would make no difference.

The Bank of England has kept interest rates at 0.5 per cent since March 2009.

Chancellor George Osborne has cited the need to keep interest rates low as a justification for his austerity policies.

Higher rates are bad for homeowners, because they increase the cost of mortgage payments. It was thought this would make a rate increase unpopular,  costing the Tories votes in 2015.

But lower rates are bad for  savers, who do not get as much interest on their nest eggs.

Rates at such a low level as 0.5 per cent mean that, when inflation is taken into account, savings are actually falling in value.

Many elderly people who rely on money saved throughout their lives to top up their pensions would welcome a rate rise.

Ros Altmann, a former Treasury adviser on pensions, said: ‘Those in or approaching retirement have often saved hard and expect to live on their savings, but what they’ve experienced is a wipeout.

‘Savings have been the sacrificial lamb of policies which have encouraged people to borrow.

Conditions: Governor of the Bank of England Mark Carney, has said he will only increase interest rates if unemployment falls below 7 per cent

‘Those who have been responsible have had their savings taken away, while those who have borrowed more than they can afford have had a huge bonanza. The message is, “You’re a mug to save because we could take it away at any time”.

‘If one is retired, there is nothing you can do to retrieve your income in future – that’s it.’

A rise in interest rates will be bad news for many homeowners who are mortgaged to the hilt, experts have warned.

Home repossessions will go up when interest rates rise and the glut of cheap home loan deals dry up as some households struggle to afford their mortgages.

Bob Pannell, chief economist at the Council of Mortgage Lenders, said: ‘The benign period of falling arrears and possessions may be coming  to an end.’

Rock-bottom interest rates have been a boon to homeowners for almost five years.

The number of repossessions has been dropping for years, with 30,000 expected this year, down from 75,500 during the 1991 recession.

But the Bank of England estimates that 8 per cent of households are now ‘vulnerable’ – meaning they spend more than 35 per cent of their income before tax on mortgage repayments.

It said this figure could double if it raises the base rate – frozen at 0.5 per cent since March 2009 – to 3 per cent.

One in six households are mortgaged to the hilt, servicing home loans that are at least four times bigger than their annual salary.

A pre-election rise in interest rates looks increasingly likely as the economy begins to recover.

Bank of England Governor Mark Carney said he would only consider putting rates up if unemployment fell to 7 per cent, which is expected before the election in 2015.

Many had assumed such a move would be a disaster for David Cameron because it would push up the cost of millions of families’ mortgages.

Lib Dem Business Secretary Vince Cable has warned against an interest rate rise, saying: ‘The danger of raising interest rates is that you hit those parts of the country which are not yet fully recovered and you push up the exchange rate. That hits manufacturers. We don’t want that.’

But the results of the YouGov poll, in The Times, appear to show that a rise might not be a disaster for the Tories.

Around 45 per cent of people expect rates to go up some time next year, of whom 31 per cent believe they would be better off as a result and 23 per cent say they would be poorer.

A further 32 per cent said a rise or fall would make little difference, while 14 per cent said they did not know.

YouGov president Peter Kellner said: ‘For the moment, when inflation looks set to stay low, a modest rise in interest rates is actually likely to please far more people than it troubles.

‘If David Cameron and George Osborne can preside over low consumer-price inflation but higher rises in the price of homes – and other assets such as shares – then some rise in interest rates is likely to win them more votes than it loses.’
