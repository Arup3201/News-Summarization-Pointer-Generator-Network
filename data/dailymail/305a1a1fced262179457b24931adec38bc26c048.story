A flock of birds had a close call after a huge chunk of ice splintered from a glacier and crashed into the sea where they were paddling.

The huge slab of ice slipped from the Chenega Glacier into the sea at Prince William Sound, Alaska, U.S.

Despite being quarter of a mile away the spectacle was caught on camera by photographer Jon Cornforth who had just a small dingy for protection.

Iceslide: Jon Cornforth, 40, was in the area with his father in a 12-foot inflatable and when he first spotted the tonnes of ice falling and bizarrely there wasn't a sound

Heads up: The huge slab of ice of titanic proportions slipped from the Chenega Glacier into the ocean at Prince William Sound, Alaska, USA

Mr Cornforth, 40, was in the sound with his 
father in a 12-foot inflatable when he first spotted the tonnes of 
ice falling.

Mr Cornforth, from Seattle, said: 'The sound was thunderous as the ice fell into the water.

'Since
sound travels slowly in this area, I saw the birds erupt in flight 
before I even saw the ice falling. The last thing that I heard was the 
actual sound a moment later.

'The birds seemed to know it was happened before it happened and were quick to get out of the way.

Mr Cornforth said he used a Canon 5DmkII and 7D along with his professional Canon L series lenses.

Chenega Glacier is one of 20 tidewater glaciers located in Prince William Sound and on the Kenai Peninsula in the U.S. state of Alaska.
