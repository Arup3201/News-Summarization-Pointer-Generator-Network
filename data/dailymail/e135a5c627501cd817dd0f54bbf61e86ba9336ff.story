Luis Suarez scored his first goal in the Nou Camp to make sure of Barcelona's passage into the last 16 as group winners. Lionel Messi and Neymar netted too as, when it mattered most, the club's forward-line delivered.

It looked as though Suarez would be best supporting actor once again assisting Messi for Barca's first of the night but after Neymar had scored his 14th goal of the season – leaving him just one behind his tally for all of the last campaign – he took the lead role making it three and putting the result beyond doubt.

The gleeful slide into the corner summed up the relief. He started the move stabbing the ball back towards Xavi and when Neymar's shot was parried he converted the rebound.

'Scoring is great for my confidence,' he said after finally breaking his home duck. 'The goal helped the team finish top. Now we know we'll be at home for the second leg in the next round.'

Andres Iniesta echoed those sentiments. 'It's better to play with your own fans pushing you over the line in the second game.' Of Barça's scoring front three, defender Jeremy Matheiu added: 'We know in the forward line we have three players who can win games on their own. We have to make sure we do our job at the other end.' 

Barcelona needed the win to top the group and it showed in Luis Enrique's team selection. There were no full-backs on the pitch as the home side started with three at the back, three in midfield and Pedro, Messi, Suarez and Neymar stretched ominously for PSG across the width of the Camp Nou pitch.

It was a forward line with goals in and with the game only 15 minutes old Barcelona needed two. Ibrahimovic found himself all alone in the six-yard box. Blaise Matuidi held the ball up with Gerard Pique at his back, rolled it to the Swede and he sent it past Marc-Andre ter Stegen for 1-0. 

If ever a player was going to celebrate his former club it was Zlatan. Spurned after just one season at Barcelona he milked the goal that now had them facing their first second-place group finish in the Champions League in seven years.

Neymar picked up the ball midway in PSG's half and carried it towards his international team-mates Thiago Silva and David Luis. They allowed him to advance and the punished them with a curling shot that nestled in Salvatore Sirigu's left-hand corner – 2-1.

PSG were behind having spurned the chances to go in front themselves. Lucas Moura missed from Matuidi's cross and Cavani shot wide from Motta's pass. Sirigu had also saved from Suarez after Pedro, Messi and Iniesta combined. A game with three goals at half time could have had six.

There could have been two more inside the first seven minutes of the second half. Pedro was played in by Neymar but lobbed over from close range and PSG then missed a triple chance at the other end. 

Lucas Moura shot a Ter Stegen and when the ball came back out into the penalty area Marc Bartra threw himself in front of shots from Cavani and Matuidi.

Suarez then had the ball in the net with a run and shot but he'd handled in the build up and the goal was ruled out. Pedro was taken off on 70 minutes as Luis Enrique brought on Rakitic to bolster the midfield.
