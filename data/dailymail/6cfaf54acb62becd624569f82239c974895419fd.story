Tourists flocking to some of  London’s most famous landmarks during the Olympics are to be treated to a new attraction – tents full of rowdy drunks.

Scotland Yard is setting up shelters near Trafalgar Square, Piccadilly Circus and Leicester Square to offer help to inebriated revellers.

In an attempt to tackle drunken violence, policemen and nurses will be on hand to offer drunks cups of tea, medical treatment and advice on how to get home.

Sobering experience: Tents like this one will be set up across central London to deal with drunken revellers during the Olympics this summer

The booze tents, which the Met prefer to call ‘departure zones’, will be open every Thursday, Friday and Saturday for the next six months between 6pm and dawn.

It is part of a crackdown on violence which will see the West End flooded with up to 400 extra officers to prevent outbreaks of trouble on so-called ‘red days’.

The move comes days after the Prime Minister unveiled plans to ban cut-price alcohol as part of a  war on binge drinking.

But critics have questioned the timing of the makeshift tents when the eyes of the world will be on the capital for the Olympics and the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee.

They fear the spectacle of drunken Britons staggering into all-night shelters will tarnish the image of the UK abroad.

Yesterday Scotland Yard said Operation Trafalgar, its biggest-ever crackdown on anti-social behaviour in the West End, would improve safety in the capital.

As well as 400 extra officers in the area, six podiums will be set up to allow the police to spot troublemakers and to provide reassurance to the public.

Violent drunks who start brawls, drug dealers, pickpockets, unlicensed minicabs and dangerous rickshaw drivers are also being targeted, with the latter facing prosecution under an archaic law from 1839 that prohibits ‘cycling furiously’.

Westminster police Chief Superintendent Simon Ovens said that if the temporary tents proved successful, officers would consider looking for business sponsorship so the scheme could be expanded.

He said: ‘It’s somewhere you can go to, or be sent to, where you can be looked after, get a cup of tea, bus advice and train advice as well as medical support.’

But yesterday London mayoral candidate Jenny Jones, who was a Green Party member of London’s Police Authority for 12 years, compared the unsightly tents to the Occupy protest at St Paul’s Cathedral.

She said: ‘It seems like Occupy are having a tent for people to stay all night. It seems a bit overblown quite honestly.

‘I am a big fan of tents but erecting one for drunks in Trafalgar Square when the eyes of the world are on London, it does not seem like a good idea to me.’
