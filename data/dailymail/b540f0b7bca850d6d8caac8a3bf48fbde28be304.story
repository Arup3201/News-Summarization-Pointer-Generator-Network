A married mother from Missouri is facing a child endangerment charge after police said she was photographed topless in a hot tub along with her half-naked 14-year-old daughter.

The 50-year-old woman, of Wentzville, is not being named to protect her daughter's identity.

The photo that landed the mother in trouble with the law was taken November 14 with the 14-year-old's phone by her sister, according to charging documents.

Parent trap: A married Missouri mother, 50 (pictured), has been charged with child endangerment for allegedly  posing topless along with her 14-year-old daughter in their hot tub

Crime scene: The woman claimed that she was getting out of this hot tub when she spotted her other daughter snapping a picture, which she then told her to delete

The topless snapshot was posted on the social media app SnapChat and was circulated around two high schools in the Rockwood School District.

St Charles County Prosecutor Tim Lohmar told St Louis Post-Dispatch that 50-year-old woman told police she had no idea her topless shot will be distributed online.

The woman's son goes to one of the schools where students saw the image on SnapChat, and he was subjected to ridicule by his classmates over the picture, authorities said. 

According to Lohmar, it is clear that the mother and her teenage daughter were posing for the photo: both were covering their nipples, but their breasts were exposed.

According to the Wentzville Police Department, the 14-year-old girl last year had 'court mandated counseling' for taking nude photos of herself and circulating them around her school.

The 50-year-old mother could face up to a year in prison if convicted of misdemeanor child endangerment.

When a reporter from the station KMOV caught up with the mother at her home on Winding Creek Drive, the woman insisted she had no intention of posing topless with her underage daughter.

'I wasn't posing, I was getting out of the tub,' she said.

According to the mom, she saw her other daughter snap the picture and ordered her to delete it, but instead the X-rated print ended up on the popular social media app that allows users to share content that disappears after a few seconds.

â€˜This is an example of some extremely poor judgment by a parent,â€™ Lohmar said.
