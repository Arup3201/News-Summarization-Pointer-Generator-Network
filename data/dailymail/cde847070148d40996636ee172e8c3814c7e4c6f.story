James Norton's acting career has recently seen a complete turnaround.

Having played the psychopathic killer Tommy Lee Royce in the BBC series Happy Valley, his latest project has seen him take on a more angelic role. 

James has recently been filming the new series of Granchester where he plays the troubled Reverend Sidney Chambers. 

James Norton, who played the psychopathic killer Tommy Lee Royce in the BBC series Happy Valley, looks cool and casual as he poses for Marks and Spencer's online magazine  

In his interview with Marks and Spencer's online magazine, James admits that his recent change in character has confused some of his fans. 

He said: 'The funniest is when people see me in a dog collar, when the public gather on set when we're filming Grantchester, and you can see them looking at me, and trying to process this memory of a psychopath now wearing a dog collar and trying to marry the two together.'

Playing the local vicar should come as a welcome relief to the 29-year-old actor, who says that his role in Happy Valleys occasionally took its toll.

James explained that getting into character was something that required a great amount of investment from him. 

'Getting into the mindset of a guy like Tommy, who I played in Happy Valley, it's a lot of work. I was put in touch with a psychologist and watched lots of films, and you have to try and empathise as much as you can with his position.'

Making a name for himself in the acting industry is something that is really important to James, who has spent his life trying to prove himself as a thespian, he reveals in the candid interview

He says that although his part was testing, the experience taught him a lot about the human psyche and he even began to sympathise with Tommy.  

'I think the mistake lots of people make when it comes to a psychopath is that they completely write off their actions as cruel, callous and completely calculated but actually the truth is that they have interests and reasons behind their actions. 

'They commit these acts of brutal murder and cruelty in order to survive, because they see the world as inherently hostile and if they don't attack, the world will attack them.'

James' understanding of the role hadn't always been so well educated and he explained that perhaps his desperation to play Tommy showed in his first audition, where he admits to coming across as a little try-hard.  

'I was desperate to show them that I could play a ruthless psychopath, so I turned up at the read-through with these big black boots on and a trench coat and sat by the tea table, and didn't look or speak to anyone. I just tried to be really enigmatic and dark and sinister and then, eventually, of course, they found out.' 

He revealed that he really admires Richard Wilson, who played Victor Meldrew in One Foot in the Grave. 'He's become a mentor,' he said of the actor

James reveals that he is a huge fan of clothes, and loves M&S. 'All my underwear is M&S,' he shared as he poses in trunks by a pool

Before his stint as a kidnapper, James took on several other television and film roles and even appeared in Doctor Who, but Happy Valleys was easily his big break.

Making a name for himself in the acting industry is something that is really important to James who has spent his life trying to prove himself as a thespian. 

James says that he has always had extremely supportive parents, with his father even appearing as an extra in several productions, but the British actor admits that not everyone is as understanding when it comes to pursuing a career in the arts. 

'It takes a lot of courage, when everyone is asking you what you want to do, if you say that you want to be a musician or an actor, people can be very condescending and say, "oh, that's so sweet, good luck with that!" It can be very frustrating.

'I think that's one of the most important things about studying drama at an institution, you go, "I am now a professional." I can say that to people and I don't care if they're condescending because I know that this is my life and this is what I've dedicated those three years to.'

The actor explains that he had the acting bug from a very early age and loved storytelling as a child 

Despite his success, James has his head screwed on and remains humble. 'I've been pretty lucky, the last few years with Happy Valley and then Grantchester have been very special, so I'm waiting for that duff job or the diva-ish cast or aggressive director!'

It's no wonder he's loving every minute; James, who admires Richard Wilson, says that he had the acting bug from a very early age and was always the kid who loved telling stories, putting them on as theatre and then insisting that his parents and all their friends would sit down and watch them.

'I grew up in the countryside so I had quite a feral life up until the age of about fourteen,' he recalls.

'I had the safety of that environment so I was able to run wild and let loose. It was totally idyllic, like an Eden that was mine with no dangers or threats. And then at the age of fifteen, I realised there was a party going on elsewhere that I wasn't invited to, and suddenly the Eden-like paradise of the countryside felt incredibly limiting - I became very oppressive and adolescent, and then was a nightmare for the rest of my teenage years.'

Today, he is loving every minute of his acting career and feels blessed to be among so much British talent. 

'As far as people I'd like to work with, the list is endless,' he says. 'I think to work with Steve McQueen would be amazing, and then some of the UK talent we have; Eddie Marsan, Olivia Colman, both of whom I have met and admired for a long time. We're very blessed in this country, there is so much talent for people to work with and learn from.'
