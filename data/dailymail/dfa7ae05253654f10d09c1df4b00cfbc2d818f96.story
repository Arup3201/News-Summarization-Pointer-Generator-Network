Just six after Japan celebrated the birth of its first panda bear in 24 years the newborn cub has died.

The young bear is thought to have developed pneumonia and was discovered on its back lying on its mother's chest at Ueno Zoo in Tokyo.

It was the first time the zoo's natural breeding programme had led to a birth, and heartwarming photos of proud mother Shin Shin cuddling her new baby had been shown around the world.

Tragic: Just six after Japan celebrated the birth of its first panda bear in 24 years the newborn cub has been found dead

Heartbroken: It was the first time the zoo's natural breeding programme had been successful, and heartwarming photos of proud mother Shin Shin cuddling her new baby had been shown around the world

The baby had been kept in an incubator earlier this week, but had been returned to its mother on Tuesday.

Keepers tried to massaged the panda's heart after it was found at the zoo, but the cub was declared dead an hour later.

Experts say pandas often struggle to conceive naturally, particularly when they are on public display.

The birth was captured on night 
vision webcam and a video showing Shin Shin giving birth and holding the
tiny baby to her chest was released by the zoo.

The cub was the first panda to be born after being conceived naturally in Japanese history.

The task is extremely difficult task as female pandas are only in heat for 72 hours over the entire year and can only become pregnant during a 24 hour slot.

In the wild female pandas normally have a cub every two or three years.

The unnamed cub was too young to have gained the characteristic black 
marks and its size is not living up to the name of Giant Panda

The baby panda was still unnamed when it died, but suggestions for names had caused a stir even before it was born.

Shin Shin's pregnancy was only announced by Japanese governor Shintaro Ishihara last month. He said the bear would be called Sen Sen or Kaku Kaku – a wordplay on the disputed Senkaku Islands which are part of Japan but are claimed by both Taiwan and China.

The giant panda is threatened by loss of habitat, poaching and a low reproduction rate.

Females in the wild normally have a cub once every two to three years.

Only about 1,600 pandas live in the wild, mostly in China's southwestern Sichuan province.

Around 300 live in captivity mostly in Chinese breeding centres and zoos but also in foreign zoos around the world.

China’s policy on panda export is very strict in order to protect their national symbol.

A panda is never sold to a foreign country, but is instead on loan for a yearly fee of up to £650,000.

There is also a clause that any cubs born during the loan belong to the People's Republic of China and have to be returned within two years.

He got a quick response from Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei regarding the islands, known to the Chinese as the Diaoyu.

Speaking at a press conference in the capital the spokesman said: ‘Ishihara’s scheme to undermine China-Japan relations is a clumsy performance. It will only tarnish the image of Japan and Tokyo,’

‘No matter what names the Japanese side gives, it cannot change the fact that the two pandas belong to China.

‘Likewise, what names Japan gives to the Diaoyu Island and the adjacent isles, it cannot change the fact that these islands belong to China.’

The zoo's panda team, comprised of five 
workers and four veterinarians, will continue using two cameras to 
observe the pair 24 hours a day for about a week, and have been joined 
by a breeding expert from Sichuan, China, where Shin Shin grew up.

Visitors to the zoo eager to see the 
baby will be disappointed as Ueno Zoo, which is the oldest in Japan, has
expressed wishes to keep the cub and mother away from the public for 
another six months.

Shin Shin and her mate, Ri Ri, are on loan from China for 10 years.

Under the terms of the agreement between Japan and China, the cub will be sent back in two years.
