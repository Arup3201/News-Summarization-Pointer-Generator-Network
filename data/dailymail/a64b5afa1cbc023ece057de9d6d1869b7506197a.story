A mother-of-one has dropped four dress sizes, going from a size 16 to a size 8, by swapping Hula Hoops for hula hooping.

Kim Middleton 29, from Middlesbrough, North Yorks, got to her heaviest of 12st 9lbs after giving birth to her daughter as she turned to takeaways and bags of crisps to fit around her busy schedule.

The teaching assistant was devastated when Elisha, now eight, wanted to learn to ride a bike but Kim found she was too big to be able to run after her.

The busy single mother was always rushing around and would just grab unhealthy food on the go

But after picking up Elisha's toy hula hoop, she noticed the pounds soon melting away - and managed to hula herself slim.

Kim said: 'I was sick of being too unfit to play with my daughter in the park and she got to the age where she was learning to ride a bike and I just couldn't help her the way a mother should.

'As a busy single mother I was always rushing around and would just grab unhealthy food on the go such as sausage rolls and packets of Hula Hoops.

'I'd be running around after Elisha all day and busy with work, so when she'd gone to bed I'd just order a takeaway and scoff on crisps.

'And I never did any exercise at all - I just didn't have the confidence.'

Kim, a single mother, had always been bigger than her brother and sister as a child but her family told her it was 'just puppy fat'.

But the single mother never managed to shift the weight and she continued to pile on the pounds throughout the years.

The turning point came when Kim stepped on the scales and was shocked that she had almost reached 13 st and was wearing a dress size 16.

She said: 'I needed to make a change in my life - I was sick of being overweight and unhappy, eating unhealthy food so I swapped the fatty Hula Hoops for a healthier alternative - and I've never looked back.'

Kim kick-started her weight loss by joining Slimming World, but she knew it would take more than just healthy eating to help her lose weight and have the toned stomach she had always dreamed of.

She was inspired after seeing her daughter playing with her child's hula hoop and decided to give it a try for herself.

Kim said: 'I was always desperate to have a flat stomach with a small waist and toned abs. When I started doing hooping I never thought I would get it, but I persevered and it paid off.'

She would use her hula hoop while watching her favourite TV show Coronation Street, four times a week.

Kim said: 'At the start it was hard going, and I ended up with a few bruises but once I got the hang of it I could really see my body changing.'

After just a month's hula hooping, Kim was amazed that the pounds were falling off her

After just a month's hula hooping, Kim was amazed that the pounds were falling off her and after 18 months of hard work she had shed a staggering three and a half stone, and was a toned size 8.

Kim, who went from 12 stone 9lbs to an impressive 9st 4lbs said: 'I am so happy with my body now, and the hula hooping has given the toned tummy I have always wanted. I would recommend it to anyone who wants to start getting fit - it's so simple and can fit into everyday life.'

Kim is now a Slimming World consultant and offerS hula-hooping advice to the slimmers in her group.

She said: 'It hasn't been easy but I have been motivated by my daughter.

'We hula hoop together now, and after all my family and friends have seen the change in me, they have all rushed out to get hula hoops too!

'It is such a fantastic way to exercise and toned up at the same time, and you can do it while watching the TV - so it really is the best of both worlds.'

'I'm so glad I binned the unhealthy Hula Hoops in favour of a hula hoop which has transformed my life.'
