Click here for your ultimate stats guide, including how Ciro Immobile's opening goal was all his own work

And right here was the reason the Champions League seedings have got to change next year.

Arsenal are about as close to being among the top eight teams in Europe as Borussia Dortmund’s mighty and magnificent Westfalenstadion is to a wet Wednesday at Gresty Road, Crewe.

They were outclassed in Germany, outplayed, at times torn apart, reduced to an imitation of a team that UEFA blithely placed in Pot 1 when the draw was made earlier this month. Arsenal have no business sitting beside the champions of Europe and the Goliaths of the strongest European leagues right now.

Ratings by MATT BARLOW at the Westfalenstadion 

They have been allowed to make the most of an impressive run of qualifications and the odd foray into the last eight, but this can no longer hide the reality. The scoreline did not flatter Borussia Dortmund. Their margin of victory could have been doubled, even trebled, without complaint. 

Their opening goal, in the final minute of the first-half, was their 15th attempt – and if anything their chances after half-time were better, if less frequent. They totalled 22 by the time referee Olegario Benquerenca of Portugal called a halt to a very one-sided contest.

Quicker, sharper, more intelligent, with greater determination at the back, quite simply Dortmund should not be this far ahead. Jurgen Klopp is a fine coach, but he presides over a club that is constantly battling to keep its finest players, often without success. The best are picked off, by Bayern Munich or the elite of England’s Premier League – Arsenal would fancy their chances of getting a player out of Dortmund every time, as they once did with Tomas Rosicky.

Yet the Germans were on a different plane. Only mistakes in front of goal stopped this being a painfully sobering rout. As it was, even the appearance of a 19-year-old rookie, Hector Bellerin, at right back cannot excuse Arsenal’s inferiority. Nothing that happened was Bellerin’s fault; and Dortmund were missing Marco Reus and Mats Hummels.

Yes, Arsenal had the odd chance, too – but even this meagre resistance raised more questions than answers, all falling to new signing Danny Welbeck, who did little to refute Louis van Gaal’s criticisms of him. The Dutchman, not reluctant to back his judgement even in the worst of times, may be saying that he told us so.

Arsenal were desperate for a striker to supplement the injured Olivier Giroud, but their problems run deeper than that. Mikel Arteta was deployed to guard the back four, but that is not his natural role and it showed. 

Dortmund were too quickly into the heart of Arsenal’s defence; any team of attacking quality will enjoy playing against them now. Arsene Wenger was once invincible with men like Patrick Vieira in midfield. It seems incredible that he no longer finds such physically imposing figures relevant to how Arsenal play.

The goals summed up Arsenal’s malaise. The first was horridly soft and come from a bungled visitors' throw-in. Possession was lost, the ball was cleared and Ciro Immobile picked it up inside his own half.

Confounding those who love to mock his rather unfortunate surname, he began a run that took him through a very half-hearted Arsenal midfield and into the path of Laurent Koscielny. The centre half – outstanding here last season – put in a lame challenge which Immobile shrugged off easily, before striking the ball across Wojciech Szczesny in goal. It was no more than Dortmund deserved. They had been by far the best team until that point.

The second was little better from Arsenal’s perspective. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, French born but playing for his father’s country, Gabon, had been wasteful in the first half but he made amends three minutes after the restart. 

A ball from substitute Matthias Ginter caused unnecessary confusion in the Arsenal ranks, allowing Aubameyang to nip in ahead of Per Mertesacker, round Szczesny and finish smartly as Koscielny collided with a post in a frantic attempt to block on the line.

And, yes, it could have been worse. So much worse. Immobile nearly grabbed his second, forcing an outstanding one-handed save from Szczesny, Aubameyang had another shot hit the bar, and Henrikh Mkhitaryan lashed one over when a cooler head would surely have netted Dortmund’s third.

The first-half had been equally frustrating for Dortmund, not least after 27 minutes when Aubameyang failed to take advantage of a lovely move that saw his team-mates switch the play from right to left. Erik Durm, Sebastian Kehl and Kevin Grosskreutz were all involved before the ball found its way back into the centre where Aubameyang was charging towards the target. 

He shot first time, but straight at Szczesny from close range. Soon after, again picking up on a pass from Kehl, Aubameyang forced another good save from the Arsenal goalkeeper. Sokratis Papastathopoulos and Mkhitaryan also wasted decent chances. Arsenal barely got a look in.

When they did, Welbeck disappointed. After 31 minutes a cross from Alexis Sanchez eluded Dortmund goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller, only for the ball to get trapped beneath Welbeck’s feet at the far post. His second miss was more glaring. 

Put through by Ramsey, with only Weidenfeller to beat, his finish was snatched and wide. In the second-half, he had a last chance to apply pressure but demonstrated only the inconsistency that supports Van Gaal’s decision to sell. Everything about his build-up play – his run, his touch – was lovely, but the finish was that of a novice, panicked, and a long way over. Dortmund were equally loose but their sheer volume of goalmouth opportunities ultimately won the game. With chances limited, Welbeck’s misses stood out.

There is a way to go yet, obviously, but Arsenal may already be eyeing second place in Group D. Galatasaray are the next opponents, at the Emirates Stadium, and a win is vital, if only to regain their confidence in European competition. This was a humbling night.
