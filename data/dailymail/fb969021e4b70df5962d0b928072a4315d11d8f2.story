Photographs taken on the streets of Australian cities have been layered with images captured 100 years ago and the results are nothing short of profound.

The digital montages were created by John Donegan from ABC Radio 702, who combined his digital stills with the original photographs taken in 1914.

One image shows a businesswoman crossing a bus lane on York Street in Sydney's city-centre, looking as though she's about to step into the 20th century.

The road is noticeably less developed in the black and white part of the image, and there's not a sign of the skyscrapers which line the city streets today.

To create these mash-ups, Donegan combined three to five of the modern digital pictures with the images from the early 1900s, according to the ABC.

Flinders Street Station in Melbourne looks much the same as it did 100 years ago, where modern trams and old motor cars grace the same streets.

Women in long dresses and bonnets with men in three piece suits and hats appear to mingle with their more colourful counterparts.

In Brisbane a smart looking shop owner stands outside the front of the City Leather Mart owned by Charles Mackler & Co while 21st century joggers run past.

Sandwiched by modern clothing stores the leather shop proves the street has long been a buzzing retail area, albeit with different generations of customers.

Steam trains travel alongside cyclists on King William Street in Adelaide, while men in suits stroll with dressed-down locals.

The sidewalk and roads are considerably different now to how they existed in 1914, and a pastry shop stands on the corner of the block.

The original black and white shots were taken on glass plate negatives, a far cry from the digital pictures snapped in an instant in the modern world.

The thought-provoking photographs are part of a collection which will be on display at the State Library of NSW from the 2nd of August until the 5th of October.
