A woman who was brutally beaten and raped on a first date has spoken about her brave refusal to hand over details of what she looked up on Google to be used against her by the defense.

Jennifer Bennett was 23 when she was 
attacked in the Bend, Oregon apartment of Thomas Bray, a 37-year-old anesthesiologist
after setting up a date with him through Match.com.

She spoke about her decision to defy the defense's subpoena for her Google searches, Facebook profile and even the journals she wrote in counseling to help her deal with the horrific assault.

Courage: Jennifer Bennett, who was raped and beaten by a man she met on Match.com, refused to hand over a list of her Google searches to the defense, saying 'I am not on trial'

The decision is one that could have landed Ms Bennett in jail for contempt of court.

She told the Today show that she was shocked to have been asked for the personal material.

She said: 'I was not the criminal. investigating me and my life, it didn't seem right, it didn't seem just.'

Ms Bennett decided to go public following the attack in hopes of encouraging other sexual assault victims to report their attacks and not feel 're-victimized' by the system. 

Though she expected to be questioned by police and interrogated by Bray's prominent attorney, she did not expect that they would try to use her own Google searches against her in an attempt to diminish the seriousness of the attack. 

Ms Bennett added: 'You make internet searches all the time but you never think that anyone is going to be looking in and using that as a reason as a defense over something horrific that happened to you.'

Bray's lawyers ordered Ms Bennett to turn over her Google searches 
because they wanted to show that around the time of the February 2011 
attack, Ms Bennett searched for the definition of rape.

Defense
attorneys believed that this would help support Bray's story that their
sexual was rough but consensual, and Ms Bennett regretted it after the 
fact so she was looking for a way to argue her way out of it.

Victims
advocates, however, decried the move. Meg Garvin, director of the 
National Crime Victim Law Institute said 'it's subjecting them to 
re-victimization by the system'.

The filing for the search results was the first of its kind in Oregon, and though the both the county judge ruled that the order was justified and the state supreme court ruled that too much time had passed to appeal, the district attorney did not comply with the order.

Google also refused to turn over their
user’s information as protected by the federal Electronic 
Communications Privacy Act unless she agreed, which she did not.

In
the end, Ms Bennett didn’t turn over her searches or her journals, but 
the sympathetic judge did not react with a contempt of court charge.

‘I chose not to because I didn't think it was fair or correct,’ Ms Bennett said.

Instead of penalizing the victim, the 
jury sentenced Bray to spend the next 25 years in jail as he was found 
guilty of rape, sodomy, strangulation and assault.

Case didn't work: Bray's lawyer tried to have the victim's Google searches submitted as evidence in order to suggest she did not really know what rape was

He was also facing charges that stem back to an alleged sexual assault of a prior girlfriend, but her claims were dismissed since the judge found them to be less valid because she continued to date him after the incident took place. 

He will also have to pay a $112,000 
fine, and $50,000 of that money will go the Ms Bennett, who moved to 
Oregon just months before the attack after accepting a job as a research
chemist at Western Washington University.

She is now training to become a high school chemistry teacher.

Aside
from the unusual invasion into Ms Bennett’s privacy, the story of the 
attack is becoming a disturbingly familiar trend as there have been many
instances of sexual assaults during dates that came to fruition via 
online dating sites.

In Ms Bennett’s case, she met Bray at a 
drink at a bistro in downtown Bend, and they then went together to 
Bray’s condo which was directly across the street for a glass of wine.

Smirking: Bray, who is a licensed anesthesiologist, also faced charges over sexually assaulting an ex-girlfriend but those charges were dropped 

Very soon after entering the condo, Ms Bennett was beaten, raped, and strangled until she passed out. She said that the abuse took place over the course of several hours.

After reporting the crime to police, she suffered scrutiny from both internet trolls and local news reporters, who published the police report and highlighted her bra size. She has since moved to Seattle.

‘Yes, I was raped. It doesn't make me a bad person. I didn't make poor choices. I was not the criminal,’ she told The Oregonian.

‘(Bray’s sentencing is) the one nugget that I could hold on to through all of this-- that a dangerous criminal will be off the streets.’
