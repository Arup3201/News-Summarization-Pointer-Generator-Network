Former England spinner John Emburey has revealed that he has skin cancer and claims that years of playing cricket outdoors in the sun caused it to develop.

The 61-year-old cricketer had surgery on Tuesday and arrived at Lord's in St John's Wood, London with a black eye and large stitches on his forehead.

Emburey, a former England legend was at the grounds to see England players who were having a practice session for their upcoming one-day game against Sri Lanka.

He revealed that he has cancer and doctors had removed an area of skin.

He told The Sun: 'It's the results of playing cricket for so many years not wearing a hat and not using suncream.'

'When I played there wasn't the same awareness of how much damage the sun can cause as there is now.'

As the most common type of skin cancer in Europe, the USA and Australia, Basal cell carcinomas (BCCs) are slow-growing epidermal skin tumours which are thought to arise from hair follicles.

This type of cancer used to be most prevalent in elderly people, but it is now being seen in people under 40 years old.

The sun-exposed areas of the head and neck are the most commonly involved areas where the cancer develops.

It predominantly affects Caucasians and is very uncommon in dark-skinned races.

While the skin over the top can remain intact for many months, it will eventually develop into an ulcer that doesnâ€™t heal.

But BCCs which are treated at an early stage are usually completely cured.

However, some BCCs are aggressive, and if left to grow they may spread into the deeper layers of the skin and sometimes to the bones, making treatment difficult.

He only became aware of basal cell carcinoma (BCC), four years ago - despite it being the most common form of skin cancer.

It is not the most aggressive form of cancer and doctors told him that it can be eliminated through surgery and might not lead to scars.

But he joked: 'Looking at my face that's hard to believe! I look like Mike Gatting after he was hit by a Malcolm Marshall bouncer.'

Emburey was a familiar face in English cricket having played 64 Tests between 1978 and 1995 for Middlesex, Northamptonshire, Western Province, Berkshire and England.

He was a right arm spin bowler and a slightly eccentric but useful lower-order batsman who was named a Wisden Cricketer of the Year in 1984.
