Yaya Toure has snubbed his Manchester City team-mates by failing to name any of them in his dream team.

The midfielder has chosen to omit the likes of Sergio Aguero, David Silva and Vincent Kompany but has named former colleagues Gerard Pique, Dani Alves, Andres Iniesta, Xavi and Lionel Messi in his ideal XI.

To add insult to injury, Toure has revealed he would call on the services of four players from his former side's arch-rivals - Real Madrid.

3-5-2: Casillas; Ramos, Pique, Hummels; Dani Alves, Iniesta, Xavi, Schweinsteiger, James Rodriguez; Ronaldo, Messi

Real Madrid quartet Iker Casillas, Sergio Ramos, Cristiano Ronaldo and James Rodriguez are included in Toure's side, while Bayern Munich's Bastian Schweinsteiger and Mats Hummels from Borussia Dortmund complete the team.

The 31-year-old has not named a single player from the Barclays Premier League despite playing in England for just under five years.

There were no stipulations when picking his side which makes his choice to not include any of his Manchester City team-mates even more bizarre. 

Frank Lampard took part in the same exercise back in September and he named current City team-mate Kompany in his dream XI.

Premier League stars Petr Cech, Branislav Ivanovic, John Terry and Didier Drogba were also included in Lampard's selection.  

The only stipulation was that he could only select players who are still 'playing today'.

Toure is expected to feature against his former side on Wednesday as Manchester City travel to the Nou Camp to face Barcelona.

The Ivory Coast international, who missed the first leg through suspension, will be hoping he can help his current side mount a comeback after losing 2-1 at the Etihad Stadium.

Luis Suarez struck twice during the match in late February before Aguero pulled one back to keep Manchester City's dreams of winning their first ever Champions League alive.

Meanwhile, City playmaker Silva has warned his team-mates that they must not concede a goal at the Nou Camp if they are going to have any chance of progressing to the quarter-finals.

'We need the kind of mentality we showed in the games against Roma and Bayern Munich in the group stages,' said Silva.

'The most important thing is not to concede a goal because obviously things then become more difficult.

'Strange things can happen. Everybody wrote Schalke off before they played Real Madrid but they won 4-3 and could have scored again which would have put them through. Nobody predicted that.

'Not many thought PSG could beat Chelsea, especially with only 10 men for so long, so I know that anything can happen, not only in the Champions League but in every game.

'Everyone is expecting Barca to go through but hopefully we can give a strong performance and we don't have any kind of pressure on us because we are behind and playing away.'
