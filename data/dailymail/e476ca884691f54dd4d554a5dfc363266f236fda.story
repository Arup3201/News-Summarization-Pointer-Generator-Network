Eden Hazard is having his best ever start to a season - but the Chelsea playmaker still doesn't even rank himself among the top five players in the world.

The 23-year-old has starred in Chelsea's impressive opening to the new Premier League campaign, and was chosen as man of the match in their recent London derby against Arsenal.

But Hazard is not completely happy - and says he needs to be decisive in every game to match the players he ranks as the top five in the world.

Joint 1st: 'The extra-terrestrials' - Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi

3rd: Zlatan Ibrahimovic

4th: Franck Ribery

5th: Arjen Robben 

'I'm not a top-five player yet,' said Hazard. 'Maybe I'm close to it, but I still have to work on some aspects. You can only be part of that group if you are decisive in the top games. I (have started) doing that, like I did against Manchester City and Arsenal.

'Who are better than me? The two extra-terrestrials, (Cristiano) Ronaldo and (Lionel) Messi, (Zlatan) Ibrahimovic, (Franck) Ribery and (Arjen) Robben. They make the difference almost every game.'

After powering Chelsea's title campaign for much of last season, Hazard ended up taking the brunt of criticism from manager Jose Mourinho for his supposed laziness in midfield, something that Mourinho blamed for the club's Champions League semi-final exit to Atletico Madrid.

But Hazard says all that is behind the pair with Chelsea's star man and manager both happy with a start that has put them five points clear at the top of the Premier League after just seven games.

'Maybe this has been the best start in my career so far, although it isn't reflected in the stats,' he added in an interview with The Telegraph. 'I have played only one bad game - against Aston Villa. I've taken a good rest during my holiday, I had a short, but good pre-season and I feel really well.

'Jose Mourinho and I get along well. I've lots of respect for him. He gives me a lot of confidence. After a bad game he dares to say, "We have played with 10 today", but that's it. At moments like that he leaves me alone.'

On Saturday Hazard and Chelsea travel to Crystal Palace - a side that the Belgian failed to break down last season as the Blues lost 1-0 at Selhurst Park courtesy of a John Terry own goal. Hazard will hope to be 'decisive' at the other end of the pitch to keep the pack chasing at the top of the league.
