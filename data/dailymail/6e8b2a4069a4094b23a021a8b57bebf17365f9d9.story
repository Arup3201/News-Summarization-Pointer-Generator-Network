The comedy scriptwriter who ensured the success of Morecambe and Wise with his witty one-liners has died at the age of 82.

Award-winning performer and writer Eddie Braben was known as the third man behind the hit comedy TV show Morecambe and Wise.

His manager Norma Farnes said Braben, who also wrote for Ken Dodd, David Frost and Ronnie Corbett and lived with his wife Dee in North Wales, died following a short illness.

See some of his work below...

Ms Farnes said: 'The writer Eddie Braben, the third man behind the success of Morecambe and Wise, died this morning at the age of 82 after a short illness.

'It was Billy Cotton Jnr at the BBC who recognised the brilliance of Eddie's writing was the ideal marriage that would guarantee the success of Morecambe and Wise.

'He is survived by his loving wife Dee, three children and six grandchildren.'

Ms Farnes added: 'Eddie was a very humble man, a very quiet man and a very private man. He had a lot of integrity, which is in short supply in this business.

'I have to say - and he would have disagreed with this - that writing came easy to him, even on bad days, when he was writing Christmas shows for Eric and Ernie and he was under great pressure. 

Eddie Braben wrote his autobiography about his life's work entitled The Book What I Wrote which was published in 2004

'He was a writer. And as Eric Sykes used
to say, when you're a writer, you're a writer 24 hours of the day. That
applies to Eddie very much. He was a great observationist.'

Sir Bruce Forsyth, who worked with Braben on Play Your Cards Right, paid tribute to the 'fantastic writer'

He said: 'This is sad news, it really is. He was a fantastic writer. What he did for Eric (Morecambe) and Ernie (Wise) was incredible. He was the third man of the comedy.

'I wish I could have been doing the kind of shows he had written. His jokes and style of writing will be sorely missed in the business.'

The Strictly Come Dancing host added that he was surprised to hear of the comedian's death, because he had recently seen him and he had 'looked fine'.

Braben, who was born in Liverpool on Halloween 1930, first discovered his passion for comedy listening to the radio shows of Arthur Askey as a child.

After school he followed his parents into market trading, manning a fruit and veg stall, but continued to writes jokes on the back of the brown paper bags he used to package his goods.

Braben then began sending jokes to comedians performing in Liverpool and sold his first piece to Charlie Chester for 2 shilling 6 pence.

But his first major success came when he teamed up with Ken Dobb and continued to help write his material for 12 years.

The fellow Liverpudlian today paid tribute to his former colleague. Mr Dodd said: 'He was a brilliant comic scriptwriter and a brilliant man. He made me laugh a great deal. He was a wonderful writer.'

The pair worked on one-liners for Dodd's quick-fire stand-up routines in the 1960s and 70s.

He added: 'He had a very good, down to earth approach to humour, and he was never satirical or vulgar. He was full of fun. He loved to laugh.

'He achieved so many wonderful things, and did so many great shows.'

Dodd's style was good training for Braben because his relentless delivery averaged around seven jokes a minute.

But
his ultimate success came when the BBC lured Morecambe and Wise from 
ITV and asked Braben to help write the show. He helped alter their 
previous characterisations and bring out the duo's real-life friendship 
in their act.

He provided the idea of the two not only living together but also 
sharing a large double bed. He countered their reticence about the idea by
pointing out that if it was good enough for Laurel and Hardy, it was 
good enough for them.

Morecambe, Wise and Braben formed what came to be known in the television industry as 'The Golden Triangle'.

Together they won the Society of Film 
Television Artists 1973 award for Outstanding Contribution to 
Television.

Braben also won the Best British Light Entertainment Script award
from the Writer's Guild of Great Britain in 1969, 1970, 1971, and 1973.

But when the comedy duo were lured back to ITV in 1978, Braben remained under contract with the BBC, and didn't team up with Morecambe and Wise again until the 1980s.

From 1982 to 1984 Braben joined Eli Woods
and Alison Steadman for 13 episodes of the BBC radio series The Show 
with No Name, all of which he also wrote.

In 2001, Braben collaborated with Hamish 
McColl and Sean Foley to write The Play What I Wrote - a stage play and 
tribute to Morecambe, Wise and Braben, which opened in London's West 
End and was directed by Kenneth Branagh.

In 2004, Braben's autobiography was published, entitled The Book What I Wrote.

Braben and his wife Dee had three children and six grandchildren. His grandson, Owen Braben, is a former TV producer at ITV and now works as a news editor at Sky News.

While Eddie Braben was responsible for some brilliant visual comedy including contributing to Morecambe and Wise's celebrated Breakfast Sketch and the Singing in the Rain routine, he was also behind some of their wittiest one-liners and most celebrated routines. Here's a small selection:

Ernie (to celebrity guest Lulu):  'Oh, Lulu, you're one of my biggest fans'

Eric: 'What's on﻿ the television?'Ernie: 'A fruit bowl and an ashtray.'

Ernie peers out of the window, a police car rushes past sirens blaring Ernie: 'He's not going to sell much ice cream going at that speed is he?'

Ernie (grasping conductor Andre Previn’s lapels): 'Listen son, I’m playing all the right notes, but not necessarily in the right order'

Ernie: My auntie's got a Whistler.Eric: There's a novelty

Ernie: I've extended my repertoire.Eric: It doesn't show from back there.
