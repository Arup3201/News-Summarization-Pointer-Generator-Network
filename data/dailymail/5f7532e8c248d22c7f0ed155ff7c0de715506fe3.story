When Chris Taylor lost his hand in a jet-ski accident four years ago, he thought his career as a self-employed engineer was over.

But he can now climb ladders, grip a length of rope and even do complex wiring, after he was fitted with a new generation of bionic hand.

He is the first person in the UK to have a 'Michaelangelo Hand' - a unique prosthetic that has electronic fingers and thumb.

This means Mr Taylor he is able to move the five digits using the muscles in his right arm.

The £47,000 device has electrodes which sense movement in the muscles and, in turn, triggers signals that are sent to the hand. It is turned on and off by pressing a button on the upper part of the hand.

Mr Taylor can now hold and grip different-sized objects and perform simple domestic tasks most people take for granted, such as doing up a button or picking up a set of keys.

The service engineer lost his right hand when he fell off a jet-ski in a horrific accident in the sea off Torquay, Devon, in 2009.

He had been gripping a length of rope that was pulling his son on a rubber ring when a large wave struck the craft. As Chris was thrown into the water, the rope tightened and ripped his hand clean off.

Since then he has experimented with a rudimentary NHS prosthetic hand but then found out about the revolutionary 'Michaelangelo Hand' that had been developed in the U.S and Germany.

Mr Taylor was referred to the renowned private clinic Dorset Orthopaedic which is trialling the new device and has become the first to be fitted with it.

The limb gets its name from the Italian artist's famous painting of the hands of God and Adam touching.

The
married father-of-three from Ivybridge, Devon, said after his accident 
he had been fitted with an NHS hand, but it had limited functionality. 
He searched online for an alternative and came across the Michaelangelo 
Hand, which he was able to afford thanks to an insurance payout.

He said: 'I was attracted to the new technology in it, the fact it had a silicone socket that would fit my arm better, the overall look of it and that the thumb could be controlled electronically.

'I am really pleased that I have now been fitted with it. It is going to be a learning curve because I have been used to not having a hand for some time now.

'It will make a huge difference to my life. Now I have got something on the end of my arm that actually works.

'It obviously isn't quite as good as a normal hand but it is much better than what I had. I can pick things up and do things that everybody takes for granted.

'It is quite a weird feeling moving it and being able to do something I couldn't for quite a long time.'

The Michelangelo Hand is attached to a socket embedded with the electrodes, that detect muscle movement.

The electronic signals are then read by a piece of software which controls the hand and make it open, close, or grip.

The
limb is made from a variety of metal, alloys and plastic, and wearers 
will require sessions with an occupational therapist to refine the 
movements.

The hand, developed by Otto Bock, moves its fingers and thumb when it detect muscle movement in the wearer's arm stump

The hand can make seven different hand positions thanks to four movable fingers and a thumb that can be separately positioned using muscle
signals

Users are recommended to charge the hand every evening for approximately four hours, and can use it for 20 hours at a time.

It costs £47,125 which includes the silicone socket, a five year warranty, and therapist sessions.

Bob Watts, the managing director of 
Dorset Orthopaedic, said: 'What sets this apart from any other 
prosthetic hand is it is far more intelligent and it has a motorised 
thumb.

'With an able-bodied person, if the brain says 'close your hand' it sends a message to the hand without thinking.

'This hand has a built-in software 
programme that does the same thing, it's just that there is no human 
hand there. But it has sensors that send the message from the muscles in
the forearm to the hand.

'As a result the wrist, fingers and thumb can respond in a much more accurate and faster way than any other hand.

'Prosthetic hands have been around 
for 30 years but this is the only one that has a motorised thumb which 
can move and grip by itself.

'You have to move the thumb into position with your working hand with the other limbs.'

Mr Taylor's hand has a five-year warranty

It was developed by Otto Bock, a German company that manufactures prosthetic limbs.

Geoff Harding, business manager at 
Otto Bock, said: 'This is a myoelectric hand which is operated by 
electronic impulses given out from the muscles in the residual limb.

'As the muscles contract, there are electrodes on the skin that put out a signal and in turn, operate the hand.

'It
is made out of metals, alloys, and plastics, and what is different 
about this hand is it mimics human movement more so than any other 
electronic hand.

'It is the first hand with a thumb that can be moved electronically like this, and it is very quick and natural.

'This
is good for Chris because a lot of his work is up on ladders and it 
will respond as he needs to use it, he will find it comfortable and 
tasks will be a lot easier.'
