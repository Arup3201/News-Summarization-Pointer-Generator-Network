They are scared of vacuum cleaners and chase their own tails, but it seems dogs may be smarter than you think.

Man's best friend can sense whether a person is lying to them or telling the truth, according to a new study.

Dogs remember if a person is trustworthy and decide whether to follow their orders based on their opinion of the human, scientists believe.

Dogs keep track of whether people lie or tell the truth so they can work out which humans they can rely on, especially when it concerns food (file picture)

The latest research, published in Animal Cognition, suggests that canines learn which people they can rely on, especially when it concerns food.

It is common knowledge that if a person points at something, a dog will usually follow the instruction and run and sniff out what they are being directed towards. 

A team at Kyoto University, in Japan, tested this theory on 34 dogs.

Firstly, a researcher pointed each of the animals towards a container which had food hidden inside, which they ran over to before eating the treat.

In the second test, the same researcher pointed each of the dogs towards an empty container, which they dutifully ran towards.

When the scientist tried to direct them towards a third tub, which had food inside, most of the dogs ignored the instruction.

Dogs will only follow orders, such as fetch, from people who have a track record of being trustworthy, research shows

However, when a new researcher pointed them towards the container, they keenly did as they were told and found the treat.

Akiko Takaoka, who led the study, said this means that dogs can use their experience of the human to judge whether they can be trusted.

She told the BBC that she was surprised that the dogs 'devalued the reliability of a human' so quickly.

'Dogs have more sophisticated social intelligence than we thought. This social intelligence evolved selectively in their long life history with humans,' she added. 

John Bradshaw, a veterinary scientist who specialises in human-animal interactions at the University of Bristol, said that dogs like their lives to be predictable.

He said: 'Dogs whose owners are inconsistent to them often have behavioural disorders.'
