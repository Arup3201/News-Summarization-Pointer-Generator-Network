A Romanian woman has become an internet celebrity after she posted a picture of herself online asking for men to have sex with her so she can get pregnant. 

Adelina Albu, 25, from Timisoara, in western Romania, is offering €500 (£350) to the right man, who will perform the bedroom necessities and then leave. 

Although the man will provide the sperm, he will have no parental rights over the child whatsoever. 

Adelina Albu, 25, from Timisoara, in western Romania has posted a Facebook advert asking for a man to impregnate her 

According to The Mirror, Adelina posted the advert on her Facebook page with the words: 'Meeting men is not a problem. Meeting one who wants a baby is.'

'So, rather than wasting my time on a pointless relationship I’m going to pay for it.'

Before she agrees to sleep with the potential partner or hand over any money, the man will have to undergo a fertility test and sign an agreement to waive rights as a father. 

Adelina added: 'Men are so immature all they think about is themselves.

'I am a mature, independent woman and I want a baby - not a man who behaves like one, but a proper one.'

Adelina now has more than nine thousand followers on Facebook and even has her own fan page. 

Her announcement comes just a couple of weeks after a Russian woman advertised for a man to impregnate her online.  

Elena Komleva, from Cheliabinsk in southern Russia also recently advertised for a man to impregnate her 

Elena Komleva, from Cheliabinsk in southern Russia, placed the advert on a social media website - and was soon flooded with offers.

The 29-year-old toe-nail painting artist described it as a 'contest' adding that her mother would select the winning candidate.

Taking to her Vkontakt page - the equivalent of a Facebook profile - she wrote: 'My mother needs grandchildren to give them all the baby clothes she has been collecting. But nobody wants to marry me yet.

'So, if you are young, strong and healthy drop me a line.

'My mother will be in charge of selecting the candidates and announcing the winner. She knows what I need.'

She has already been inundated with offers from men, with many posting replies to her advert.
