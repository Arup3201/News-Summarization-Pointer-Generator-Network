A costume worn by child star Judy Garland during the making of the classic film The Wizard of Oz is expected to sell for £180,000.

The 'test' dress and pinafore was one of several that were made for Garland while producers experimented with how they wanted her character Dorothy to look in the 1939 movie.

The outfit was the first of the prototypes made to feature a blue and white Gingham pinafore - a feature the producers stuck with for the final dress design.

Although Garland, who was 17 at the time, never wore the dress on film, several photographs exist of her wearing it on set.

The images will be sold alongside the outfit at an auction dedicated to film memorabilia.

The rare outfit was bought by a private party when Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, the film studio which made The Wizard of Oz, held a sale of their costumes in the early 1970s.

It has since been passed among several collectors, and is one of the most sought-after film costumes on the market.

The film launched 17-year-old Judy Garland's acting career

The original dress sold at auction in November 2012 for $480,000 - around £290,000- and another prototype dress sold the year previously for $910,000 - or £550,000.

Catherine Williamson, head of entertainment at Bonhams, said: 'This dress is an early design of the one that was finally worn in the film.

'There were several variants made before they settled on the one we all know from the film.

'It doesn't appear on screen but we do have stills of Judy Garland modelling it. They took pictures and then the producers would take a look and see if they liked it or whether they wanted to make more tweaks.

The original dress was sold off by the film studio in the 1970s, reaching £290,000 at auction in November 2012

'The important thing about this particular dress is that it features a gingham apron. That was a big moment for the producers when they decided that was the look they wanted to go for.

'The dress itself didn't work but they loved the blue gingham - and that's how we got to the dress that was used in the film. It was the last step.

'This dress helped create the enduring image of the Dorothy we know and love.

'This dress was sold off by the film studio in the 1970s and it has had more than one owner. The present owner has had it for less than 10 years.

'There is a huge demand for Wizard of Oz memorabilia - it is universally beloved and visually stunning. The costumes are unique and material from the film is some of the most collectible in the marketplace.'

The auction will take place in New York on November 24.
