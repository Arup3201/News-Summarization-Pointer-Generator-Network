A set of identical four-year-old triplets are awaiting life-saving surgery after all three girls were diagnosed with the same brain disorder.

Izabelle, Edith and Adlette Ramirez defied doctors who told their mother, Isabel, she would never be able to have children. 

Without any form of fertility treatment, she fell pregnant with triplets.

Diagnosed: Izabelle, Edith and Adlette Ramirez, aged four, all have Chiari Malformation brain disorder

Danger: The girls need surgery to save them from paralysis as their brains push into their spinal cords

But since birth they have received constant treatment for muscular and speech issues.

And in January, an MRI scan revealed they all suffer from Chiari Malformation.

The condition pushes the back of the brain into the spinal cord. If untreated, it can lead paralysis or death.

Mrs Ramirez and her husband are now planning to travel from their home in Oro Valley, Arizona, to Michigan so the girls can be treated by their chosen neurosurgeon Dr Holly Glimmer.

'It's scary for them and I try to be very honest. I try to comfort them. 

'I tell them Mommy is going to be there. Daddy is going to be there,' Ramirez told CBS.

Miraculous: Isabel Ramirez was told she was infertile but fell pregnant with triplets without fertility treatment

Struggle: All three have been in and out of hospital since birth with various muscle and speech defects

Adorable: Mrs Ramirez said the girls are all 'fighters' and their struggles have not dampened their spirits

MRI scan: Izabelle, pictured, started repeatedly falling over so she was scanned and found to have the disorder

Doctors discovered the disorder after one of the girls, Izabelle, kept falling over and struggling to follow information.

She was scanned, alongside her sisters as a precaution.

The news was a devastating blow for the family as their insurance does not cover treatment for all three girls. 

'I never let the girls see me cry, upset, or scared. I want them to see me strong. They're such fighters. I am so proud to be their mom,' Ramirez added. 

Difficulties: Isabel Ramirez hopes to get treatment for the girls in Michigan if she can afford the surgery

Insurance: The family's insurance does not cover surgery for all three girls with Dr Holly Glimmer in Michigan

Staying strong: Mrs Ramirez said she doesn't cry or get upset in front of the girls who are strong and positive
