Colombian legend Faustino Asprilla claims that Radamel Falcao’s relationship with Louis van Gaal is ‘broken’ and his compatriot will leave Manchester United when his loan from Monaco runs out at the end of the season.

Falcao was said to be stunned when he was axed from United’s 18-man squad to face Southampton on Sunday after starting the previous five games, and held talks with Van Gaal at Carrington on Monday.

It has raised serious doubts over United’s intention to go through with a permanent £52million deal, with Falcao’s agent Jorge Mendes admitting that the 28-year-old might have to go elsewhere for regular first-team football.

Faustino Asprilla claims Falcao's relationship with Van Gaal is broken

Asprilla, who had an eventful two-year stay at Newcastle in the 90s, has blamed Van Gaal over his treatment of Falcao and accused him of driving the player out of Old Trafford.

‘If Van Gaal continues he will leave,’ Asprilla told IB Times UK. ‘I think it is a relationship that has already been broken. Falcao understands that the coach does not want him.

‘I remember when I went to Newcastle Kevin Keegan wanted me. He supported me a lot and here it is obvious that Van Gaal does not trust Falcao.

‘It is sad to see how he is treating Falcao. The problem is not Falcao, but the coach. Falcao had an injury earlier in the season, but after he proved that he is still the same top scorer he used to be.

‘He played five games and scored goals. But this is all about giving him confidence. After playing well some games it is inexplicable that he suddenly stops playing.

‘The truth is that I do not know what Van Gaal is trying to do at United. And I think both players and fans are also confused. He does many changes without reasons.’
