The IPCC is investigating South Yorkshire Police over the handling of a complaint made against paedophile singer Ian Watkins

The police watchdog is investigating a second force over the handling of complaints made against paedophile rock star Ian Watkins.

Watkins, the lead singer of the Welsh group the Lostprophets, is due to be sentenced next month after he admitted to a string of horrific child sex offences including attempting to rape a fan's 11-month-old baby boy.

The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) is already investigating claims that South Wales Police failed to act quickly enough having allegedly been told Watkins was planning to abuse children as early as 2008. 

They have now launched a second investigation over the handling of a complaint made against Watkins to South Yorkshire Police in 2012.

An IPCC spokesman said: '‬The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) is independently investigating South Yorkshire Police’s handling of information concerning allegations against Ian Watkins made in 2012. 'This follows a referral from South Yorkshire Police in September.'

Watkins, who was described in court as a 'determined and committed paedophile', was arrested late last year after South Wales Police raided his home on a drugs tip and stumbled upon hard drives containing images, videos and conversations about him attacking children.

From early 2010 horrified fans who had become friends with Watkins went online to beg for help after discovering vile images on his computer.

Friends claim they called police to tell them the 36-year-old was a paedophile but officers did nothing, allowing him to go on to subject babies to the most horrific abuse.

A disturbing child porn profile created in that time by Watkins was viewed by more than 40,000 people on the internet and yet appears never to have been monitored by authorities.

In one post, written before his arrest, a fan wrote: ‘His on-off girlfriend reported him to police twice for being a paedophile.

‘He sent pornographic pictures of a little girl to a few girls telling them it was a five-year-old girl he’d raped. He also watches child porn constantly. Sick sick man.’

Watkins allegedly boasted to obsessed female fans that he had HIV and was on a mission to pass it on to children.

The comments will only add to the growing
 fear that Watkins's guilty pleas offer only a glimpse of the true 
extent of his drug-fuelled debauchery.

Watkins, 38, is due to be sentenced next month after 
he admitted to a string of horrific child sex offences including 
attempting to rape a fan's 11-month-old baby boy

Former
 girlfriend Joanna Majic, 38, warned this week that sex predator Watkins
 had abused hundreds of young victims during years of secret offending.

She
 claimed besotted female fans of the paedophile are hiding the true 
extent of his offending because they secretly offered their children for
 abuse.

She repeatedly reported Watkins to the police from 2008 onwards but her accusations were not acted on at the time.

One fan added: ‘A girl found info on 
his computer on how to drug children. He told her he was thinking of 
giving kids drugs. He does need to be arrested before he infects anyone 
else.’

It emerged that he 
was filmed committing the sex acts on the baby boy the day after 
Lostprophets final album Weapons was released.

Watkins,
 a former boyfriend of BBC radio and television presenter Fearne Cotton,
 appeared on BBC Radio 1 just hours before the incident in April last 
year.

The 36-year-old, from Pontypridd, South 
Wales, plotted the shocking abuse with the two mothers of the babies in a
 series of text and internet messages.

Upset: Miss Majic says the scale of Watkins' abuse is being hidden by fans who were complicit in allowing him attack children, she claims 

The baby's mother, Woman A, admits aiding and abetting the attempted rapes on her son.

She also admits sexually touching the child and taking photographs, before sending them to Watkins.

Watkins also admitted conspiring to rape and sexually touch the daughter of the second fan.

He admits aiding and abetting Woman B to touch her daughter while he watched on Skype.

An
 earlier court hearing was told police had 72 pages of conversations 
between the pair online talking about their sexual relationship.

Woman B mentioned she had a daughter of a young age and Watkins said: 'Bring her along as well.'

She said she was getting the child ready for their meeting together - and 'what they all will do together' when they meet up.

She
 admits sexual assault after touching the child, she also admits taking 
an indecent photograph of the child before distributing them.

Nobody from South Yorkshire police was available for comment.

Anyone who has been affected by the Watkins case, or other cases of child abuse, is urged to contact South Wales Police on 029 20634184 or the NSPCC on 0808 800 5000.
