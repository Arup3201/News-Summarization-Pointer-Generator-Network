Kevin Durant may have scored thousands of NBA baskets, but none will ever be as memorable as the one he made on Monday night.

The Oklahoma City Thunder were trailing 98-93 with just 14 seconds left on the clock when Durant grabbed the ball and was knocked off balance by Memphis Grizzlies defender Marc Gasol.

But as Durant fell backwards into the stands, he made one last desperate attempt to make a shot - and miraculously, the ball went in for three points.

During the play the star was also fouled which won him an additional free throw - which he netted, completing the sensational four point play.

Unbelievable: Kevin Durant shoots as he is knocked off balance on Monday - but he miraculously scores

The crowd roared in shock and celebration - while the Grizzlies looked at each other in disbelief.

Social media went wild, too.

'Playoffs are over,' sports writer Brian Phillips wrote on Twitter. 'That basket was the championship. Thank you for watching basketball.'

Alecko Eskandarian, assistant coach for the New York Cosmos, added: 'Kevin Durant deserves the MVP award this year just for that shot alone. AMAZING.'

The Thunder later tied the game, but the Grizzlies won in overtime for a final score of 111-105, with the Grizzlies' Zach Randolph scoring 25 points.

It leaves each team with one game in the first round.

When Durant was asked, after the game, if he had scored his best ever shot, he could only focus on their loss.

'I don't know, man,' he said. 'We lost, so it really don't matter.'

The Memphis win gave Dave Joerger his first playoff win as a head coach.

Dismissive: After the game, Durant said his basket didn't matter because his team lost the game anyway

'Tremendous game to be a part of,' 
Joerger said following the game. 'I honestly can tell you that, whether 
you win or lose. I know that we won. But I thought it was a great game 
to be a part of.

'The game was never over. There was a lot of great plays and not just the-ball-going-in kind of plays - loose ball, passion, playoff basketball.'

Game three will be held in Memphis on Friday.
