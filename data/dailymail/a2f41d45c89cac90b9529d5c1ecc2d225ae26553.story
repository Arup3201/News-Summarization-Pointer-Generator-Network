The microscope at the University of New Haven, set at 10-times magnification, shows a marijuana leaf covered with dozens of tiny bumps of mold, and someone

The tiny bumps aren’t easily detectable with the naked eye, so someone somewhere could be smoking similarly contaminated pot and not have a clue.

Heather Miller Coyle, a forensic botanist and associate professor at the university, says all sorts of nasty things not visible to the naked eye have been found in marijuana - mold, mildew, insect parts, salmonella and E. coli, to name a few.

Moldy marijuana: A 10X magnification of a pot leaf shows tiny bumps of mold all over the specimen and researchers the University of New Haven say contaminants like this as well as insecticides, insects, and others are becoming increasingly common

Invisible menace: While the marijuana tested at the University of New Haven may appear normal to the naked eye, the contaminants become visible when magnified

That's why Coyle and her students earlier this year began developing a new process to detect contaminants in marijuana through DNA profiling and analysis. The aim is to be able to identify potentially harmful substances through a testing method that could make the analysis easier and quicker for labs across the country in the developing industry of marijuana quality control testing.

Twenty states and Washington, DC, now allow medical marijuana with a doctor's recommendation, and Washington state and Colorado have legalized the recreational pot use. Connecticut and Washington state already require testing and other states are doing the same, spawning a testing industry.

‘If there's no certification ... it's like saying we don't check our meat for mad cow disease,’ Coyle said. ‘That's our goal as a private university, to develop the tools to address or mediate this issue.’

A number of labs around the country 
are testing marijuana for contaminants using different methods, many of 
which have been around for decades and used to test other plants, 
including food crops, for harmful substances.

The
 health effects of marijuana tainted with mold, pesticides and other 
contaminants aren't clear, said Mason Tvert, a Colorado-based spokesman 
for the Marijuana Policy Project in Washington, D.C. The project was 
founded in 1995 to lobby for the reduction or elimination of penalties 
for marijuana use.

‘Although
 we have not seen significant problems with tainted marijuana in the 
past, we should certainly be taking steps to make sure it's not a 
problem in the future,’ Tvert said. ‘We have never seen a death solely 
associated with marijuana use. The same certainly can't be said of 
alcohol and other drugs.’

¿Significant toxicological threat¿: Another group in California this year found that pesticides found on marijuana could pass to the smoke, and then the smoker, when burned and inhaled

'Mediate this issue': Heather Miller Coyle, an associate professor at the University of New Haven, shows a DNA she hopes will help her develop a new method to detect contaminants on marijuana using DNA profiling and analysis

Food and Drug Administration records from 1997-2005 show no cases in which marijuana was the primary suspected cause of death, but the drug was listed as a secondary suspected cause contributing to 279 deaths.

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in July that an ‘epidemic’ of synthetic drug use has caused rising numbers of deaths and emergency room visits.

One study released earlier this year, however, found that pesticide residues on cannabis are transferred to inhaled marijuana smoke, possibly posing a ‘significant toxicological threat.’ The study was done by The Werc Shop, an independent testing lab for medical cannabis in Pasadena, Calif., and published in the peer-reviewed Journal of Toxicology.

New problems, new solutions: Twenty states and the District of Columbia now allow medical marijuana and Washington and Connecticut are blazing the trail toward a certification process patients can lean on for assurance their marijuana is safe

Marijuana can develop mold from an inadequate drying process or poor storage conditions after harvesting. It can also become tainted with E. coli and other dangerous substances by being near farm animals.

Coyle will be developing a new method
 for creating DNA profiles of biological contaminants found in marijuana
 including mold, viruses, fungi and bacteria. The profiles could then be
 compared with DNA profiles of organisms kept in a database maintained 
by the National Center for Biotechnology Information - a division of the
 National Institutes of Health.

‘What
 we're trying to do is put the information together in a user-friendly 
format,’ Coyle said. ‘Having some better technology in place is a good 
thing.’

The 
university's work also will include identifying whether cannabis 
material is real marijuana or a synthetic version comprising 
non-marijuana herbs sprayed with THC, the compound that gets users high.

Coyle
 is aiming to complete the new process by next summer. What happens 
after that hasn't been determined. The school could patent the process 
and sell it for a fee to whoever wanted to use it, or could allow its 
use for free, she said. The school also could establish its own 
commercial testing lab.

The
 University of New Haven's work is an extension of the law 
enforcement-related marijuana DNA profiling the school has done over the
 past five years under a $100,000 grant from the federal Office of 
National Drug Control Policy's High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas 
program. The school created a marijuana DNA profile database that has 
helped federal authorities determine where illegal pot growers and 
dealers got their product.
