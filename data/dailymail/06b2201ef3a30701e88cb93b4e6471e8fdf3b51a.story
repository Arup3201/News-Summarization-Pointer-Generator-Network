Commuters in London could soon pick up Amazon orders at their local underground station under plans to turn ticket offices into parcel drop-off points.

Transport for London is reportedly in talks with the online retail giant after it announced it's going to close all 240 ticket offices by 2015 with the loss of 750 jobs.

Mayor of London Boris Johnson announced 
the closures yesterday, along with a 24 hour tube service on certain lines over the weekend, saying he wants to fully automate tickets 
sales instead.

But today it was reported that TfL is now in talks with Amazon over possibly converting the hundreds of empty offices into parcel collection points.

Plans: TfL are reportedly in talks with Amazon to turn ticket offices, left empty by plans to fully automate ticket sales by 2015, into parcel collection points

'Click and collect': Pick-up lockers, similar to this one pictured, could be installed in the empty offices

It is thought that pick-up lockers - which allow customers to collect goods bought online and avoid missing a delivery to their home - would be installed in the spaces.

The news comes as supermarket giant Asda
 announced a deal with TfL earlier this week to launch similar 'click 
and collect' services in car parks of six Underground stations.

Instead of delivering a parcel an address, Amazon customers can opt for their purchases to be dropped at a locker location. This removes the risk of being out when it is delivered in the post.

Once the parcel arrives at the locker, the buyer will get an e-mail notification with a unique pick-up code and a barcode.

The email will also include details of when the lockers - often located in supermarkets - are open.

When the customer arrives at the locker, they then enter the pick-up code or scan the barcode, releasing the package.

Customers have three business days to collect the parcel before it is sent back to the Amazon depot for a refund.

The service costs £1.99 for next day delivery or customers can chose a free service - where goods take around two business days to reach the lockers.

When contacted today, Amazon declined to comment.

Graeme Craig, Director of Commercial Development at TfL said 'We have set out our vision for the future of the Tube which includes the introduction of 24 hour services at weekends, simpler ticketing, easier refunds and Wi-Fi across our network.

All Tube stations will continue to be staffed and controlled at all times.

'As part of our broader commercial development, we are working with retailers to transform the services on offer for our  customers. This week it was announced that we are working with Asda on a trial to offer click and collect services at six of our London Underground station car parks and are looking to work with other retailers to offer similar services.'

Yesterday Mr Johnson and London 
Underground Managing Director Mike Brown announced the radical changes 
to the Tube network - which will be implemented over the next two years.

They said six major 
central London stations will have special customer points to help 
tourists with ticket machines, while every station will be staffed while
 the tube is running.

As well as closing ticket offices, they announced the Tube will run 24 hours a day on Fridays and Saturdays on certain lines.

The vast majority of stops on the new night route map are north of the River Thames.

The new weekend service will run on core parts of the system - initially the Piccadilly, Victoria, Central and Jubilee lines and parts of the Northern line.

Other initiatives announced included improved ticket machines, contactless bank card payment technology from next year, extended Wi-Fi coverage at underground stations, and staff based in ticket halls and on platforms rather than in ticket offices.

TfL says the changes will be better for customers and help save more than £40m a year.

Mr Johnson said: ‘For 150 years the Tube
 has been the beating heart of London, its tunnels and tracks providing 
the arteries that have transported millions of people and helped to 
drive the development and economic growth of our great city.

‘Now
 it is time to take the Tube to the next level and so for the first time
 in London's history, we will provide a regular 24-hour Night Tube 
service at weekends.

'This will not just boost jobs and our
 vibrant night-time economy, it will further cement London's reputation 
as the best big city on the planet to in which to live, work, visit and 
invest.’

But there was threats of retaliation from unions yesterday.

Manuel Cortes, leader of the TSSA rail union, accused London Mayor Boris Johnson of being the ‘hypocrite of the decade’, saying the announcement would lead to the closure of all 268 Tube ticket offices by the end of next year

The Rail Maritime and Transport union warned of industrial action, adding that staffing levels will be 'decimated'.

General
 secretary Bob Crow said: 'The Mayor must believe he is some sort of 
magician if he thinks he can slash jobs and still run safe services when
 everyone knows that staffing has already been cut to the bone while 
passenger demand continues to rise.

'Throwing
 in the plan for night time operation at the weekends is just a 
smokescreen to try and camouflage the real issue which is a savage cuts 
to jobs, access and safety.

'We
 will work with sister unions and the public to fight these plans and 
that means using every campaigning, political and industrial tool at our
 disposal and our executive will be looking at a timetable and a 
strategy for that campaign, including a ballot for industrial action.'

‘It beggars belief that the Mayor who was elected in 2008 on a pledge to keep open every ticket office is now planning to close every single one, with all that means for safety and jobs.’

They will be campaigning to reverse the decision.

Shadow London minister Sadiq Khan criticised a reduction in staff, adding: ‘The Mayor of London has today ripped up his manifesto promise to the people of London. As a result of his plans, Londoners will feel more anxious travelling at times when stations may be deserted.

‘Commuters will have nowhere to turn when their Oyster card is lost, stolen or broken. It will make the daily commute more difficult for everyone but, more worryingly, there are serious concerns about whether there will be enough staff at London's busy stations to respond in emergency situations.’

London Underground said it was committed to delivering the reduction in operational staff numbers ‘without any compulsory redundancies'.

Managing Director Mr Brown defended the job cuts. He said: ‘People are at the heart of this vision - our customers and staff.

'My commitment to London is that all Tube stations will continue to be staffed and controlled in future, with more staff visible and available to help customers buy the right ticket, plan their journey and keep them safe and secure.’

The plan aims to deliver savings of £270million over the term of Transport for London's business plan to 2020/21.
