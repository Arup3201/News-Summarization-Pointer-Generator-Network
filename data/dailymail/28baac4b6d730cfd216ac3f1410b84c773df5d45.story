Martha Stewart has at last offered an insight into the rigorous beauty and health regime that helps her to maintain such a youthful appearance. 

Interestingly, the 73-year-old admitted that her seemingly ageless complexion does take a fair amount of work each and every day - starting off with a 4am wake-up call. 

'I spend anywhere from seven to 30 minutes getting my face and hair ready each morning,' she told People.com. 'This doesn't include the time I spend doing advance prep like my daily face mask, which I apply at 4 am, and I use hand cream with gloves.'

Age is just a number: Martha Stewart, 73, follows a strict skincare regime in order to maintain her complexion

Lifestyle expert: The TV host explained that there are many other aspects of her day-to-day routine which impact on how she feels and looks, particularly when it comes to sleep and exercise

Martha added that she follows up her early morning Yon-Ka Gommage mask with a strict skincare routine, starting with the Mario Badescu A.H.A. Botanical Body Soap and ending up with the $525 Cle De Peau La Crème.

The TV host's choice of pricey products caused a stir among her fans, many of whom were less than enthusiastic about the prospect of having to spend so much money on a face cream in order to replicate Martha's youthful appearance.

'Only $525 for a jar of her daily moisturizer? I think I'll age like a regular person, thanks,' one reader commented, while another added: 'Ladies, save your [money], I'm married to a dermatologist. 

'It's 50 per cent genetic and 50 per cent staying out of the sun, avoiding alcohol, exercising, and eating well.'

Luckily however, not all of Martha's favorite beauty products come with quite the same hefty price tag.

'I always have Johnson's Baby Oil in my medicine cabinet,' she added. 

'At night, I wash my face really well, because I have to have my makeup done a lot. Johnson's Baby Oil with a warm washcloth is one great way to take it off.

Budget-friendly: Not all of Martha's skincare choices come with a high-end price tag. She insists that Johnson's Baby Oil is the best product to use when it comes to removing make-up

'I like oil because it keeps my skin very moist, and it works for me. I don't get clogged pores.' 

Despite being praised for her flawless complexion however, when it comes to choosing her own best physical features, Martha insists her hair draws in just as many compliments as her skin and credits an ever-changing roster of shampoos with helping to maintain her lustrous locks.

Martha also added that following a strict workout routine, avoiding alcohol and ensuring she gets plenty of sleep have all contributed to her glowing complexion and healthy physique. 

She insists that, whenever she has a big photoshoot or event to prepare for, she spends the days leading up to it preparing, in order to make sure that she looks her very best.

But even Martha admits that nobody is perfect; she confessed that there are a number of things people would likely change about her if given the chance, but added that she doesn't let any of them weigh on her mind for too long.

'I have learned a lot over the years, but think everyone needs improvement,' she said. 'I could weigh 10 pounds less or comb my hair more often, for example.'
