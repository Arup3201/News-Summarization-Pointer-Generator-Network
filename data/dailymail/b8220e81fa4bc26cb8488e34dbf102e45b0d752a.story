Couples face being charged more for wedding venue hire, photography and DJs than other events - because businesses hike up their prices when they hear the party is for a wedding.

Consumer watchdog Which? found that one venue was prepared to charge its researchers four times as much to hold a wedding than a family party.

Researchers posed as engaged couples to get price quotes from venues, DJs and photographers in Edinburgh, London and Manchester for the survey.

Some businesses charged couples more when they heard they were booking a wedding, consumer watchdog Which? found

They then approached the same businesses pretending to be booking a family reunion for the same day with the same number of guests, and were often offered better deals.

Researchers bartered one photographer down to £320 for the reunion, but were told that £450 was their lowest possible price for the wedding booking.

All four DJs contacted by the Which? team bumped up their prices for a wedding.

One Edinburgh-based DJ said the wedding would cost between £300 to £350 compared with £200 to £250 for the family party.

The researchers had better luck with wedding venues, with only one offering a different price.

That venue quoted £850 for room hire with a minimum of 120 guests, even though the Which? team asked to make a booking for 100.

When the team called the same place pretending to be holding a reunion for 100 people, they were immediately offered a £200 room without prompting.

A Which? spokesman said: 'Our snapshot research reveals some businesses are cashing in on a couple's big day by hiking up prices.

One photographer told the undercover team that he could do a family party for £320 but could not go any lower than £450 for a wedding booking

'We advise people to shop around to find the best deal before signing any contract.'

Last month, a study of 1,000 people who got married in the past five years found that the average spend on a venue was £2,164, while the average cost of a photographer was £876.

Couples spent £682 on entertainment on average, with 24 per cent telling the Sheila's Wheels study that they felt they were overcharged by wedding suppliers.

A fifth said they were too embarrassed to haggle over prices.

One in eight said they found themselves £3,000 in debt from their wedding celebrations, with couples spending £18,244 on getting married and enjoying a honeymoon.

More than half of the newlyweds (52 per cent) felt wedding costs had spiralled out of control.
