His eight weeks doing porridge left him looking distinctly well-fed.

But Chris Huhne clearly didn’t think the morning of his release from prison was the time to start a diet.

Less than an hour after he walked out of jail, he was tucking into a full English breakfast at a motorway cafe.

The disgraced former Cabinet minister polished off two rashers of bacon, two sausages, two eggs, two hash browns, some black pudding, baked beans and tomatoes.

His £6.50 also bought him a round of toast and a mug of coffee at the Pit Stop Cafe near Junction 17 of the M4.

The former energy secretary had an 
unlikely breakfast companion for his first taste of freedom – 
transvestite artist Grayson Perry.

Despite only just being released, he agreed to meet Bafta-winning artist Perry, who was interviewing him for a Channel 4 documentary.

The artist won the Huw Wheldon Award for Specialist Factual Bafta on Sunday for his documentary All in the Best Possible Taste with Grayson Perry.

A café worker told The Sun: 'It was a real shock when Chris Huhne walked in. This other man was showing everyone the Bafta he won the night before.'

The former Liberal Democrat MP was then taken back to his home in Clerkenwell, central London, where he was met by a pack of reporters.

Huhne was released on licence after serving just two months of his eight month sentence after his ex-wife Vicky Pryce took his speeding points a decade ago.

His partner Carina Trimingham told waiting reporters that he would subject to an immediate curfew that will operate from 7pm to
7am.

Chris Huhne’s ex-wife is to publish a book based on the diaries she kept during her recent two months in prison, her publisher said.

The book, Prisonomics, will be published in early September, Biteback Publishing revealed. The book is not said to be a full memoir, but will draw on diaries the economist kept during her period in prison.

The new book will use a style similar to Pryce’s previous publication Greekonomics, and is said to be a very personal book examining prison life, but also a hard-hitting economic analysis of the cost to the economy of keeping women in prison. Pryce said: 'I am pleased Biteback will again be publishing a book of mine. I kept a diary while in prison and I have some strong views on how the prison system works, especially with regard to how it treats women.'

‘We’ve
got to move – we’re causing an obstruction!’ he shouted after 
discovering that his arrival by taxi had caused the road to be blocked 
by journalists and spectators (and he wouldn’t want to break the law, 
would he)?

Hand in hand 
with his bisexual partner Carina Trimingham, he told everyone to ‘calm 
down’

He then added: ‘I would just like to say once again, as you know 
from the night I was sentenced, I said that I was very sorry for what I 
had done.

‘It has been a humbling and sobering experience.

'I
would like to thank all of those who have written to me – hundreds of 
letters that I have had – and all my family and friends who stood by me.

‘And I would also just remind you that I have served only part of my sentence and therefore it is not appropriate to say more.

'I would now like to get on, get back to home, and continue with my life.’ 

The
entire show lasted less than three minutes before the front door of the
£1.2million home he shares with 45-year-old Miss Trimingham slammed 
shut.

Miss Trimingham had come fresh from 
taking a law exam nearby, an irony upon which no-one remarked. 

Huhne was taken away by car at around 7am and driven to his London after two months away

‘We’re looking forward to a few dinners in,’ she said chirpily.

The
electronic tag came a few hours later, courtesy of a visit from 
security specialists who attached it to his leg and installed a control 
and monitor box at the house.

Huhne had been met by his father Peter after being released on licence from Leyhill open prison in Gloucestershire.

Ten years of deceit came to an end in 
March when Huhne was jailed for eight months with ex-wife Vicky Pryce 
after finally admitting passing speeding points to her.

Yesterday
she too returned to her home, in Clapham, South London, after being 
released from East Sutton Park prison near Maidstone, Kent.

Pryce, who will also have to wear a tag, told reporters the first thing she planned to do was have a cup of coffee.
