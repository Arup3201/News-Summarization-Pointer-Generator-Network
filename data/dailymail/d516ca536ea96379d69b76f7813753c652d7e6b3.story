It is closer than most people would dream of getting to a pack of hungry lions.

But this mobile enclosure allows visitors at Orana Wildlife Park, in Christchurch, New Zealand, to come eye-to-eye with the big cats... at feeding time.

Up to 20 tourists pay £15 each to squeeze into the cage with keepers and watch the lions being fed.

Lions jump up the sides and onto the top of the moving mesh enclosure allowing people to get as close as is safe to the fearsome carnivores.

Keepers feed the lions from within the cage, giving visitors the chance to watch them feed in their habitat.

Park spokesman, Nathan Hawke, said: 'The Lion Encounter is a genuinely unique visitor experience.

'While people can see lions in numerous 
places, we think we can get you as close as you would safely want to get
 to view these magnificent animals.

'We've had visitors who have come to Christchurch just to take part in this encounter.

'It is an interesting way to display lions and also enables us to discuss ways in which visitors can help the King of the Beasts.'

The daily feeding trips into the lion enclosure costs $30 (£15) each, with a minimum height restriction of 1.4m for safety reasons.

Orana Wildlife Park is New Zealand's only open range zoo, set on 80 hectares of park-like grounds.

Over 400 animals from 70 different species are displayed.
