Senior doctors say it is ‘utter folly’ for patients to be able to get routine appointments and surgery on the NHS seven days a week.

They say running the health service ‘like Tesco’ – which has many stores open 24 hours a day – is unaffordable.

The expense would be further ‘magnified’, one doctor said, because staff working on Sundays would expect a ‘premium rate of pay’.

The Government wants to improve staffing levels and the availability of NHS services at weekends following concerns that patients are dying because current standards are poor.

Last month a study revealed that patients undergoing routine surgery at the weekend were 82 per cent more likely to die compared with on a Monday – partly because fewer consultants were on duty.

The British Medical Association, which represents senior doctors, said the NHS cannot afford to provide the same tests and treatments at weekends as it does during the week.

Dr Chaand Nagpaul, a member of the BMA’s GP committee, said: ‘It’s utter folly to compare the NHS therefore with a seven days a week supermarket.

‘Tesco opens for seven days for commercial reasons alone.’

Dr Chaand Nagpaulsaid that Tesco opens seven days a week for commercial reasons, and it is unrealistic to compare the supermarket with a GP

Addressing the association’s annual conference yesterday, he said: ‘Nurses and physios in hospital and community, health visitors, social workers, pharmacists will all need to be funded and open seven days a week or it would be a nonsense to claim a routine NHS service if it is only partial and piecemeal.

‘And of course staff working on Sundays will expect a premium rate of pay magnifying the expense.’

Joyce Robins, co-director of Patient Concern, said doctors simply did not want to work out-of-hours and were putting their ‘own interests before the patients’.

She said: ‘When you are ill it doesn’t matter what time it is, you need the appropriate care.’

GPs can opt out of working evenings and weekends under a contract negotiated under Labour which also led to their salaries doubling.

A similar contract for hospital consultants in 2003 allowed them to work fewer evenings and weekends.

The chairman of the BMA, Dr Mark Porter, said ‘we all want’ weekend care to be at the same standard as that provided during the week. 

But he added: ‘The calls we sometimes hear for a Tesco NHS, full service, 24/7, are just ridiculous when the health service can barely afford its current model.’

Katherine Murphy, chief executive of the Patients’ Association said the ‘NHS should be an organisation that puts the patient at the centre of everything that it does’. 

She said: ‘It is time for all professionals to accept that the NHS must be a 24 hours a day, seven day a week service.’
