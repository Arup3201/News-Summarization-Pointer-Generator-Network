A German photographer has captured three generations of her family in a series of identical poses and clothes.

Nina Röder shows how her family has changed in the sequence of pictures of her grandmother Theresia, her mother, Dagmar and herself in exactly the same outfits and rooms.

The photos were taken in her mother’s childhood home in Windsbach, Bavaria, and are designed to reflect a particular memory about her mother’s life.

Generation game: Nina Röder's mother Dagmar pulls on the same dress and poses in the same room as her daughter and mother as part of an art project

Reflecting: Nina Röder's grandmother Theresia takes a look in the mirror as she is pictured wearing the same dress as her daughter and grand daughter

They reference her mother’s prom night and her work as a hairdresser.

The
 work by academic Nina Röder, 31, is intended to question how her 
grandmother remembers the events and how she herself feels about them as
 a daughter.

She said: 'The interest in my mother’s youth is
 based on the fact that I wanted to get to know my mother better and 
maybe to learn  indirectly more about myself.

The photos were taken in the childhood home of Nina Röder's 61-year-old mother, Dagmar, pictured and were designed to reflect memories about her life

'I wanted 
to see her not only as my mother – but as a woman who had a life before 
me. A life full of hopes, first loves, dreams and ideas.'

'Both
 agreed immediately to work with me on this project. My family is from a
 little town in Bavaria so they never had any relation to the art world.
 To me it is fantastic because they both can criticise my work very 
honestly without any prejudices.'

Her grandmother, who was a housewife, now aged 87 and her mother is 61.

Nina
 Röder studied Theatre and Media at the University of Bayreuth, and 
Media Art and Design with the focus on photography at the 
Bauhaus-University in Weimar.

She has subsequently worked at Bauhaus-University since 2012 as an academic assistant for photography.
