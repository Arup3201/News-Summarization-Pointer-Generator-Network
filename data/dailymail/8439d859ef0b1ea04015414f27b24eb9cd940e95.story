With weeks to go until the World Cup kicks off, the preparations are well and truly underway. It's time for new stars, new optimism, and of course a new ball.

Unveiled by adidas in late 2013, the ‘Brazuca’ is the official ball of the World Cup 2014 and it’s the 12th the sports giant has made for the global tournament - and Sportsmail took the opportunity to road-test it back in December.

Following on from the heavily criticised Jabulani in South Africa, the science inside the new ball has now been revealed to show how the best players in the world will have the perfect tool on the pitch.

The science revealed: Adidas'  'Brazuca' is set to be an improvement from the last World Cup, with more reliability

Stats: Weighs 0.96 pounds and has a low absorption rate, meaning it can retain shape and weight even in rain

Improvement: The Brazuca is set to be one of the most aerodynamic balls used at a World Cup in recent memory

'Supermarket ball': The infamous Jabulani ball was used at the 2010 World Cup

The Brazuca ball has six polyurethane 
panels that are bonded to keep the ball the same weight and roundness in
 even the heaviest of rain.

The never-before-seen panel shape revolutionizes the game by producing faster flight speed and maintaining true roundness.

The bladder of the Brazuca ball is made of latex and provides the desired rebound.

The
 ball is textured and feels more like the adidas’ Finale 13, the 
official UEFA Champions League ball, than the adidas Jabulani used in 
South Africa four years ago.

The
 adidas Brazuca ball, in a bold white/night blue/multicolor colorway 
befitting Brazil, is the most colorful ever for a FIFA World Cup.

Adidas came under fire four years ago for the unpredictability of their ball, with goalkeepers especially unimpressed.

Michael Carrick compared it to a 'beach ball', Daniel Agger said it made players 'look like drunken sailors' and Brazil stopper Julio Cesar claimed it was 'like a ball from a supermarket'.

But adidas claim the 'rougher' Brazuca will avoid an 'unreliable flight', and will have vastly improved touch and accuracy.

‘We do extensive flight path analysis and the results have shown constant and predictable paths with deviations hardly recognisable,’ Matthias Mecking, Adidas football director, told the BBC.

The ball itself weighs 437 grams (0.96 pounds) and it has a water absorption rate of just 0.2 per cent, meaning it can retain its shape, size and weight even in the rain (which could benefit England in Manaus).

The manufacturers have recently announced that a promotional ball will be fitted with six cameras to capture a 360 degree view of the on-pitch action.

According to their YouTube page: 'adidas developed an innovative camera-ball; the brazucam. Capturing 360º views through six different lenses, offering fans around the world the opportunity to enjoy and share the love of football from an entirely new perspective.

The ball is created by six propeller-shaped polyurethane panels being thermally bonded together.

Between the seams the Brazuca also has a different geometry to other balls, helping it remain more stable in the air.
 ‘The most important thing on the soccer ball is how much roughness you 
have,’ Dr Rabi Mehta, an aerodynamics expert at Nasa’s Ames Research 
Center in California, told the BBC.

Smoother balls, as seen with the previous Jabulani, are more unpredictable due to a process known as ‘knuckling’.

As air passes over the seams it can create a force that knocks or moves the ball.

The Brazuca, with its multiple seams and roughness, will be less prone to the ‘volatile swoops’ of the Jabulani.

‘The smoother you make the ball, the higher the speed at which it knuckles,’ says Dr Mehta.

‘In
 essence what happened in my opinion is that with the traditional ball, 
the critical speed at which you got maximum knuckling was lower than the
 typical kicking speed in World Cup soccer.

‘By
 making the ball smoother, that critical speed went up and happened to 
coincide with the typical kicking speeds, about 50 to 55 miles (80 to 88
 kilometres) per hour, especially in free kick situations.’

This year’s rougher ball brings us ‘back to square one’ says Dr Mehta.

Another way the Brazuca seems to have overtaken the Jabulani from four years ago is the depth of the seams.

The Brazuca’s are about 0.06 inches (1.56 millimetres), compared to just 0.02 inches (0.48 millimetres) for the Jabulani, about three times shallower.

The total length of the seams on the Brazuca are also longer, and all of this combines to make the ball rougher - travelling further. It can be compared to dimples on a golf ball, with the seams disrupting the flow of air.

‘This agitation is essential for fast and reliable flight,’ Dr Simon Choppin, a research fellow at the Centre for Sports Engineering Research at Sheffield Hallam University.

Robo-boot: The Brazuca underwent a series of extensive tests, including this robotic boot trial, in order to meet and exceed FIFA regulations

Putting the pieces together: The Brazuca ball is comprised of a groundbreaking six-panel design, which improves symmetry, uniformity and efficiency

‘A perfectly smooth ball experiences large amounts of drag and high aerodynamic forces.

‘The seams of a football disturb the flow of the air.

‘This results in a smaller wake-area of low pressure - behind the ball - reducing the pressure difference and reducing the force, which slows the ball down. The lower drag force means the ball travels for a longer distance.’

The result is that the ball should more closely resemble traditional 32-panelled balls that most footballers are used to, with Mehta insisting 'the complaitns we got in the last two World Cups will be minimised.

Despite this ball having just six panels, the deep and long seams will create one of the most advanced footballs yet used at a World Cup.

And Cesar, hoping to lift a dream trophy with his Braziulian colleagues this summer, is a lot happier.

'The ball is a good one, we had contact with it today,' the former Inter Milan and Queens Park Rangers player said of the Brazuca after training with it on Wednesday.

'I think the outfield players are going to like it too,' he added.

German-based players have had a six-month advantage with the colourful samba-inspired ball, as England and other nations could not kick it competitively due to a Nike contract.

They have been using a similar Nike Ordem ball. Brazil,
 France, Portugal, USA, Holland, South Korea, Australia and Croatia must
 also use the ball in their international friendlies leading towards the
 World Cup.

Lionel Messi used the Brazuca in an international friendly for Argentina, and England captain Steven Gerrard has joined him in praising the newest model.

'The sign of a good ball is when no one really talks about it,’ the Liverpool midfielder said at the launch event in December.

‘I
 don’t think anyone will have anything negative to say about Brazuca. I 
think the feedback from players will be really positive.

'It's very true and reliable, and those are the two most important things I want from a ball.

'The
 Champions League ball has always been a big favourite among the players
 because of how reliable it is. Brazuca’s very similar and I think the 
players will be very happy about that.’
