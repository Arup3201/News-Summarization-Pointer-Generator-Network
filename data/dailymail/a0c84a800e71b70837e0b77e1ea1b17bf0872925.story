Engaged: Silvio Berlusconi with Francesca Pascale in 2009. He has announced he is marrying the TV presenter, who is 49 years his junior

Controversial former Italian prime minister Silvio Berlusconi has announced his engagement to a girl old enough to be his granddaughter.

Twice-married Berlusconi, 76, today confirmed that his new partner was TV showgirl Francesca Pascale, 27, who has been at his side constantly in recent weeks since he announced he would be running in next February’s General Election.

The cruise ship crooner turned politician made the revelation during a long and wide-ranging interview on one of his numerous TV stations - and it came despite the fact he is still officially tied to his second wife Veronica Lario.

Berlusconi, who is currently on trial accused of having sex with an underage prostitute, said: 'It’s official, I have got engaged to Francesca Pascale and finally I feel less lonely.

'There is a 49 year age difference between us. She is a beautiful girl on the outside and even more beautiful on the inside, of solid moral principles, she is very close to me, she loves me and I feel the same way.

'She is a very good friend of my daughter Marina.'

In recent weeks the two have been seen together at the San Siro stadium in Milan watching his AC Milan football team and they were also snapped laughing and joking at a pizzeria in the city centre.

The two have been linked before and she has been seen driving into his apartment in Rome. She is a former councillor in Naples with his People of Freedom Party.

Miss Pascale has strongly defended Berlusconi in the past and cooed how she loved his ideas in interviews and is also famous for singing a song which includes the eye opening line of: 'If you pull your knickers down the ratings go up.'

Berlusconi also spoke of his ongoing trial which is centred on his infamous bunga bunga parties and again insisted nothing untoward took place at the evenings in his villa at Arcore near Milan.

He said: 'There was nothing illegal going on, they were just elegant dinners. It was a particular moment for me, I had just announced my divorce, my mother and my sister had just died.

'I would go home and there was no-one there, I felt sad.'

Berlusconi is alleged to have paid Moroccan belly dancer Karima El Mahroug for sex when she attended the parties as a 17-year-old girl and dozens of other TV starlets were also said to have been given cash, jewellery and cars for turning up.

The age of consent in Italy is 14 but paying a woman under the age of 18 is seen as prostitution with a minor and is punishable by up to three years in jail.

But Berlusconi hit back at judges and prosecutors in Milan where the case is being heard, once again insisting they were politically led and out to get him.

He said: 'I have fallen into their trap, it’s been built up by the judiciary. The trial is just an incredible machination.

'It was an excuse they needed to hit me with a massive defamation operation against me and my government which had international implications.'

He added: 'In a twenty year political career you get used to all sorts of insults. But there is something that before God smells of a vendetta.

'I have been convicted to four years in jail by a court in Milan who accused me of being behind a system that saved me three million euros a year but at the same time I paid 570million euros in taxes.'

In a 120-minute interview on his Canale 5 station with host Barbara D’Urso, Berlusconi also explained why he was running for prime minister a year after being forced out of office.

He said: 'We are in the same situation as 1994 - if I don’t run then the Left will get in. We cannot run the risk of them winning.'

Despite his boasts commentators see a win for Berlusconi as unlikely given that his party is trailing third in the polls with around 20% of the vote, with Democratic Left leader Pier Luigi Bersani the favourite to win.

Berlusconi’s appearance on the show unleashed a storm of protest on the internet, with many expressing anger at what they described as an 'obvious and concrete example of a conflict of interest.'
