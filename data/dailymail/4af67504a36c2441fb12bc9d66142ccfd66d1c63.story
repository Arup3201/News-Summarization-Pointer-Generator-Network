Jaw-dropping footage has emerged of a Russian man dangling one-handed off a crane hundreds of feet in the air.    

The footage, captured in Engels, near the city of Saratov, shows fearless Alexander Rusinov dangling perilously from the edge of building crane.

The 20-year-old has found fame in Russia due to his def-defying stunts that involve hanging without any safety wires from monuments, buildings and cranes at perilous heights. 

The 20-year-old still has time to interact with the cameraman, but better make sure he doesn't lose his focus

The daredevil knows no bounds when it comes to personal safety. But before he tries a stunt, he always thinks twice before doing anything. 

He also says his tricks are thoroughly prepared.'I really like what I do,' he adds. He says he is only afraid of hurting himself — not of plunging to the ground below him.

The height of the crane is all too apparent in this shot, yet Rusinov is confident to carry on

Not content with pull-ups, Rusinov displays some more of his strength at the heart-stopping height

The teenager started practicising parkour after watching films of other daredevils on the internet and started training in a playground and in the school gym just a year ago.

Since then he decided to up his game and take advantage of some of his hometown Saratov's impressive architecture and began doing handstands on bridges over the Volga River jumping between rooftops and scaling walls.

Rusinov has been practicing his skills for many years after watching videos of other daredevils online

He has since amassed an army of fans after posting his videos on YouTube.

Known as the Saratov Spiderman, he has said in the past that instead of fearing death, he prefers to imagine that he is safely on the ground while performing stunts.

Naturally, his worried family disapprove of his rather dangerous hobby.
