Objects that crashed to the ground in China have been identified as space debris, state media reported, after a Russian rocket carrying a communications satellite fell back to Earth minutes after lift-off.

Qiqihar city in the northeastern province of Heilongjiang, which borders Russiaâ€™s far east, reported that several objects appeared to have fallen from the sky on Friday, the Xinhua news agency said.

One of the parts is a metal dome with jagged, blackened edges.

Space debris from a Russian rocket that exploded in the earth's atmosphere have fallen in China, according to state media

After analysis, experts have concluded they were 'parts from a carrier rocket or a satellite', Xinhua said Sunday, citing the China National Space Administration.

Authorities were communicating on the issue 'with relevant parties,' it added.

On Friday the Russian rocket ferrying one 
of Europe's most powerful satellites into space exploded in the 
earth's atmosphere, setting the former Soviet state's commercial space 
program back 'three to four years'.

Russia's workhorse Proton-M was carrying the $275-million Express
 AM4R satellite when it failed and burned up, destroying 
the telecommunications module intended to bring high-speed internet to 
remote parts of the country.

It
 was the second failure for the Proton-M in less than a year, and the 
second time that it had failed to deliver such a European satellite, 
after the last one crashed shortly after launch in 2011.

Friday's
 unmanned mission went awry when the engine on the third stage of the 
Proton-M booster rocket failed, Oleg Ostapenko, head of the Russian 
space agency Roskosmos, told Russian news agencies.

He said the precise 
cause was unknown.

The unmanned mission went awry when the engine on the third stage of the Proton-M booster rocket failed 100 miles up

The 
failure occurred at an altitude of 160 km (100 miles), about nine 
minutes after the early-morning lift-off from the Russian-leased 
Baikonur facility in Kazakhstan.

The
 state-run RIA quoted Ostapenko as saying that the rocket and all debris
 had burned up in the atmosphere: 'We can say with certainty that 
nothing reached Earth.'

However,
 Russian media said some debris may have fallen into the Pacific or been
 scattered over Siberia and Russia's Far East.

No casualties or damage 
were reported on the ground.

The
 lost Express AM4R satellite, worth more than 200 million euros ($275 
million), was described by its maker Astrium, a unit of the European 
aerospace group Airbus, as one of the most powerful satellites built in 
Europe.

Its loss delays a number of commercial projects by three to four years.

'It's
 a heavy blow, of course. And the thing is that our workhorse rocket - 
our most powerful and the most-used rocket - has such a bad record,' 
Ivan Moiseyev, head of the Russian-based Institute of Space Policy think
 tank, told Kommersant-FM radio.

He said the rocket had a 7 
percent failure rate, and its unreliability was making it harder for 
Russia to compete in the multibillion-dollar global satellite launch 
industry, giving a boost to its European rival Arianespace and the 
American newcomer SpaceX.

Trouble in the sky: A Proton M rocket carrying the Canadian Anik F3 telecommunication satellite blasts off at Baikonur Cosmodromein 2007. But it has suffered a series of mishaps since

'It's
 a very unsuccessful picture on the whole and, if you compare it with 
our main competitors, with Europe, their last accident was 12 years 
ago,' Moiseyev said.

Last 
July, three navigation satellites worth about $200 million were lost 
when the Proton-M rocket crashed near the launch pad shortly after 
take-off.

That accident 
strained relations between Kazakhstan and Russia and led Kazakhstan to 
temporarily ban Proton launches from Baikonur.

State-run Rossiya-24 television said all launches had been suspended from Kazakhstan after Friday's failure.

Embarrassing: In September 2007, the Proton-M's booster rocket crashed destroying the Japanese JCSAT-11 communications satellite on board. Pictured is the crash site near Zhezkazgan, in Kazakhstan
