This is the eight-foot tiger shark a 12-year-old boy caught off the coast off Florida on his first ever fishing trip.

Kip Houghton was sitting on the boat with his family off Melbourne Beach in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, when he felt a strong pull on the end of the line.

The youngster ended up battling with the beast for 40 minutes before he managed to pull it up onto the side of the boat, with the help of the crew.

First catch: Kip Houghton was sitting on the boat with his family off Fort Lauderdale, Florida, when he felt a strong pull on the end of the line. His crew then helped him to pull in the eight-foot tiger shark 

Speaking to Florida Today, Kip said: 'They moved me to the captain's chair. I felt the reel was locked. It wouldn't move at all. It was a 40-minute battle.' 

According to Kip, the captain could tell immediately that he had hooked a shark, although they couldn't identify it until it was landed. 

He said initially they thought it may have been a bull shark or possibly a short fin mako. 

'I couldn't believe it. We were actually quite close to shore I touched its tail and it was made out of pure muscle. I always thought that you could move it around or at least squeeze it. It was as solid as a brick.'

After the shark was landed and measured the crew returned it safely to the sea. 

Kip said: 'We were not going to kill it. Sharks are incredible creatures that are so misunderstood When they bite people, it's usually an accident. Sharks make mistakes.'

Struggle: The youngster, on his first family fishing trip, battled with the crew and family by his side for 40 minutes in a bid to reel in the creature 

Close: The boat was only a small distance from Melbourne Beach in Fort Launderdale, Florida, when it was caught (file picture)
