Some of the earliest photos of Victorian women have come to light in a revealing and historical album of prints from the pioneering days of photography 150 years ago.

The rare set of pictures taken by Lady Clementina Hawarden, one of Britain’s first female photographers -  whose work was avidly collected by Alice In Wonderland writer Lewis Carroll - is set to fetch £150,000 at auction.

The photos, which date back to the 1860s, were taken by Lady Hawarden of her daughters and rank as one of Britain’s first ever fashion shoots.

She is rated as one of the 
most influential Victorian fine art photographers, blazing the way for 
women in the profession when it was dominated by men.

Lady Hawarden enlisted her daughters (Isabella, above) as models and got to work with a stereoscopic camera and set the standard to which aspiring photographers reach for today

She enlisted her daughters as models and got to work with a stereoscopic camera and set the standard to which aspiring photographers reach for today.

Born Clementina Elphinstone Fleeming in 
Dunbartonshire in 1822, she was the third of five children of a British 
father, Admiral Charles Elphinstone Fleeming (1774-1840), and a Spanish 
mother, Catalina Paulina Alessandro (1800-1880).

One of five children, she grew up on the family estate, Cumbernauld, near Glasgow.

Much
 of Hawarden’s life remains a mystery. But in 1845 she married 
Cornwallis Maude, an Officer in the Life Guards.

In 1856, Maude’s father,
 Viscount Hawarden, died and his title, and considerable wealth, passed 
to Cornwallis. Hawarden and her husband had ten children, two boys and eight girls, out of whom eight survived to adulthood.

In 1859, the family also acquired a 
new London home at 5 Princes Gardens, in South Kensington. Much of the square survives as 
built, but No. 5 has gone.

From 1862 onwards, Lady Hawarden used
 the entire first floor of the property as a studio, within which she 
kept a few props, many of which have come to be synonymous with her 
work: gossamer curtains; a freestanding mirror; a small chest of 
drawers; and the iconic ‘empire star’ wallpaper, as seen in several of 
the photographs.

The superior aspect of the studio can
 also go some way to account for Hawarden’s sophisticated, subtle and 
pioneering use of natural light in her images.

It was also here that Lady Hawarden 
focused upon taking photographs of her eldest daughters, Isabella Grace,
 Clementina, and Florence Elizabeth, whom she would often dress up in 
costume tableau.

The girls were frequently shot - 
often in romantic and sensual poses - in pairs, or, if alone, with a 
mirror or with their back to the camera.

Hawarden’s photographic exploration 
of identity - and female sexuality - was incredibly progressive when 
considered in relation to her contemporaries, most notably Julia 
Margaret Cameron.

Graham Ovenden said in his book, 
Clementina Lady Hawarden (1974): 'Clementina Hawarden struck out into 
areas and depicted moods unknown to the art photographers of her age. 
Her vision of languidly tranquil ladies carefully dressed and posed in a
 symbolist light is at opposite poles from Mrs Cameron’s images... her 
work... constitutes a unique document within nineteenth-century 
photography.'

She exhibited, and won silver medals,
 in the 1863 and 1864 exhibitions of the Photographic Society, and was 
admired by both Oscar Rejlander, and Lewis Carroll who acquired five 
images which went into the Gernsheim Collection and are now in Texas.

Tragically, Hawarden was never to 
collect her medals.

She died at on 19 January 1865, after suffering from
 pneumonia for one week, aged 42. It has been suggested that her immune 
system was weakened by constant contact with the photographic chemicals.

Now an important collection of 37 albumen prints by her and a pair of pencil sketches of her and her husband are to be sold.

The images are derived from a single 
album, the vast majority not represented in the Victoria & Albert 
Museum’s collection, where the majority of her work is housed.

Francesca Spickernell, photography specialist at Bonhams, said: 'It was pioneering for a woman to be taking photos like this at this point in the 19th century.

'Her output was prolific and she won awards for her work. She struck out into areas and depicted moods unknown to the art photographers of her age.

'The photography scene at this point in history was dominated by males so for a female to achieve the amount of recognition she did in such a short space of time was a tremendous achievement.

'Most photography was very masculine and mostly architectural so these elegant, feminine shots really stood out at that time.'

In 1939, her granddaughter presented the V&A with 779 photographs, most of which had been roughly torn from their original albums with significant losses to corners. Proper examination, and appreciation of this gift, was delayed by World War Two, and it was not until the 1980s that there was a detailed appraisal and catalogue of the V&A holdings.

This comprises almost the entire body of Hawarden’s surviving work apart from the five images now in Texas, and small groups or single images at Bradford, Musie d’Orsay and the Getty.

Some smaller images are arranged on album leaves that are still intact - measuring 322 x 235mm. As distinct from the V&A’s holdings, it is presumed that these images have been taken from an album which may have belonged to one of the sitters or their siblings.

The most significant group in the present collection are all approximately 198 x 144mm. and tend to depict one figure in the first floor front room at 5 Princes Gardens.

Curiously there are no images of this size in the V&A collection, but the presence of close variant images in a smaller format suggests that Lady Hawarden was using two cameras in the same session.

The photographs have been in the same 
private collection for the last 50 years and will be auctioned by 
Bonhams in London on March 19.
