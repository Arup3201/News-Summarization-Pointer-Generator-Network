Former President Ronald Reagan's foundation expressed outrage today after a vial said to contain his blood taken after a failed assassination attempt was put up for sale in an online auction.

The Guernsey-based PFC Auctions claimed the blood was from a sample taken after the President was shot and seriously wounded outside a Washington hotel in 1981.

As the bidding passed $9,700 yesterday, John Heubusch, executive director of the foundation, threatened legal action and said it would fight to stop 'this craven act.'

Presidential fluid: The seller's mother asked the director of the lab that handled Reagan's blood tests where she worked if she could keep the tube

He said the hospital where Mr Reagan had been treated had assured the foundation that an inquiry was under way into 'how something like this could possibly happen.'

The website for PFC Auctions showed a picture of a blood-filled vial with a label stuck to it showing the president's name.

The glass vial is five inches long with a half-inch diameter, and has a white label with purple ink writing attached to it.

The label reads 'Reagan Ronald', lists the president's patient identification and the exact date of the assassination, March 30th 1981.

Reagan's birth date is incorrectly listed as February 2nd 1911. His actual birthday is February 6th of that year.

Mr Reagan suffered a punctured lung and internal bleeding when he was shot by John Hinckley Jnr outside the Washington Hilton Hotel.

Reagan survived the assassination attempt at the Washington Hilton Hotel in Washington, DC where he was for a speech.

Sale: A seller whose deceased mother gave him a vial of Ronald Reagan's blood she had kept since his 1981 assassination attempt is auctioning the tube

Hinckley was later found not guilty by reason of insanity. He is allowed to visit his family away from the psychiatric hospital where he is being treated.

Also posted on the PFC site was an image of a form from Bio-Science Laboratories that lists George Washington Hospital as the source of the vial, along with a statement from an unnamed person offering the vial for sale.

The seller wrote that the vial came from his or her late mother, who took it from her workplace at Maryland-based Bio-Science Laboratories, where blood work and testing were done for George Washington Hospital.

The seller said he had contacted the California-based Ronald Reagan Library and Museum, which is run by the late president's foundation, months ago and had been told that Mr Reagan's family would like to have the vial given to them.

In a letter of provenance on the site, the seller claims : 'The test tube and the lab slip that I have are for his blood work to be tested for lead on. The testing was completed and the test tube was sitting on my mother's desk.

'At the end of the week, she asked the director of her laboratory if she could keep the paper work and the test tube. The director of the lab told her no problem and really never gave it a second thought. It has been in my family ever since.'

The blood residue remained with her family for three decades. After the seller's father passed away in 2009 and the mother died in late 2010, the seller inherited the presidential fluid.

The seller said that an official at the Reagan Library had checked with lawyers, the FBI, the National Archive and other agencies before telling him or her 'everything was OK'.

'Since 30 years had passed by, he thought that it was simply something that was of no importance at this time and that I was free to do with whatever I wanted with it.

'He then stated that he felt the family would be interested in it being returned to them and if I was interested in doing so to contact him and he would make all of the arrangements.

'I told him that I didn't think that was something that I was going to consider, since I had served under Pres. Reagan when he was my Commander in Chief when I was in the ARMY from '87-'91 and that I was a real fan of Reaganomics and felt that Pres. Reagan himself would rather see me sell it rather than donating it.'

'Real fan': The seller really liked Reagan's economic policies so decided to sell the blood tested when he was wounded in 1981 instead of donating it

The seller claimed to have contacted the Reagan national library and national archives about whether they would be willing to purchase the blood.

But neither entities were interested in the vial and paperwork - though they did threaten to have the seller investigated by police over his or her possession of the artifacts.

Mr Reagan, who went on to serve two terms as president, died at the age 93 in 2004.

A spokesman for PFC was unavailable for comment yesterday.

Other items available for sale on the site include Winston Churchill's personal letters, a slice of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's wedding cake, a Cuban flag signed by Fidel Castro and Che Guevara and guitars signed by John Lennon, the Rolling Stones and U2.
