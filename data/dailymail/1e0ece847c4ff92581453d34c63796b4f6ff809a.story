It's been one of the most talked-about award seasons yet. From Eddie Redmayne's tearful triumph, to Dakota Johnson's awkward red carpet run in with her mother. 

But if there is one thing that once again set tongues wagging it's the beautiful gowns on the red carpet. 

From Scarlett Johansson's gorgeous green Versace gown to Dakota Johnson's beautiful red Saint Laurent number.

The stars of Toddlewood have recreated some of the best Oscars looks of this year including Scarlett Johansson's green Versace dress (left) and Jennifer Lopez's Ellie Saab gown (right)

And now the young stars of Toddlewood have recreated, and paid homage to, some of the best Oscars looks of this year following the Academy Awards this weekend. 

Including Reese Witherspoon's Armani Prive gown and Jennifer Lopez' gold Ellie Saab ensemble. 

Toddlewood is the brain child of New York photographer Tricia Messeroux, who takes everyday children and turns them into celebrities. 

In particular Tricia likes to photograph the children in red carpet looks because she says: 'I love fashion, I love photography and I love kids. 

'What better way to get everything I love than to Make It Happen Toddlewood-style!'

Tricia has previously worked on transforming children into Grammies stars and hilariously Kim and Kanye. 

Here are our favourite Oscar's looks, Toddlewood style...
