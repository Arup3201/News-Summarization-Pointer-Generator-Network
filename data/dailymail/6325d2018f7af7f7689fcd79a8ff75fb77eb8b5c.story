A father has been charged with murder after the body of his two-year-old son was found dumped in a lake, police have revealed.

Steven Blue, 31, is being held without bond following the death of Tristan Blue in Raleigh, North Carolina. 

Police announced on Thursday that Blue had been arrested following the disappearance of the child a day earlier from their apartment complex. 

Tristan Blue, two, went missing from his home in Raleigh, North Carolina, on Wednesday. His remains were then found in a lake, authorities revealed 

Steven Blue, 31, has been charged with the youngster's murder while the child's mother, Briana Dangerfield, 25, has also been arrested and held for multiple offences 

The boy's mother Briana Dangerfield, 25, was also charged with accessory after the fact, altering and destroying evidence and attempting to conceal the death of her son and a misdemeanor child abuse.

On Friday a search operation launched by authorities in the area discovered remains believed to be of the boy in Beaver Dam Lake in North Wake County. 

According to WCNN, in a 911 called released by Raleigh police on Friday, the caller told the dispatcher she woke up 15 minutes previously to find the boy had gone.

They added that there was a package outside the front door and was concerned because the youngster could not normally open the door to the property. 

A 911 caller told police that a package was left outside the home where the boy lived and he was not inside. They were concerned as he was normally unable to open the door

One member of the community told the station that those living near the apartment complex where the boy stayed were heartbroken at the news.

'It's a somber mood. Everybody is just kind of moseying around and doing the best they can. Of course there were plenty of police officers patrolling so everybody is just kind of in a downward type of mood.'

Miss Dangerfield's bond was raised from a $100,000 secured bond to $1 million after additional charges were added to that of misdemeanor child abuse.
