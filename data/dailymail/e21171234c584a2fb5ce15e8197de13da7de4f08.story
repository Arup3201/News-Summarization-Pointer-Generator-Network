There are plenty who would like to see Ryan Gauld make his Scotland debut against Georgia on Saturday. Far fewer who think he actually will.

Gordon Strachan's message has been clear. The Sporting Lisbon playmaker, an utter rarity in the Scottish game, was brought in to the squad to get to know people. To familiarise himself with the faces, the hard humour, the initiation rituals. 

Scotland's national coach wants to speak to Gauld and watch him in action. He wants to find out, first hand, what the fuss is all about. Just how good he is.

None of this sounds like the former Dundee United prodigy is about to be plunged into the starting line-up in a must-win qualifier against Georgia. Still to start a first team game for Sporting, the teenager would have to play out of his skin in training to elbow his way to the front of a strong, established crop of Scotland attacking midfielders.

And yet, as assistant manager Mark McGhee told the 18-year-old yesterday, stranger things have happened. The issue is not pre-determined.

'I pulled Ryan aside this morning and I said to him that, before the Croatia game last year, we pulled Barry Bannan up at the last minute.

'Barry trained so well he ended up playing. He has now played seven or nine games or something.

'So I said to Ryan: 'Don't be afraid or embarrassed to try. You don't need to think you are just here so we can get a look at you.'

'It's up to him really as to how much he shows Gordon about where he fits in to the pecking order.

'It's not a decision that has been made prior to him arriving here. He is here and one of the squad and if he shows up well enough he has a chance.'

All coaches base their decisions on what they see on the training ground. Yet few put more store on what their eyes and instincts tell them than Gordon Strachan.

Assistant manager Mark McGhee says Gauld is not in the squad just for the coaches to get a look at him

Asked if Gauld has any chance of starting, McGhee answered as he must: 'Absolutely.' Lifting a player's spirits and confidence before dumping them in a bin hours later has never been part of the Largs coaching manual.

Yet the truth is this. For all the populist, public clamour to 'put the kids in', the likes of Shaun Maloney, Bannan, Ikechi Anya, Steven Naismith and James Morrison will take some shifting. Scotland have improved under these players.

If Gauld progresses as football people suspect he might, the young man will take his place on merit soon enough. But not yet.

'Well, he has a lot of good players ahead of him,' McGhee conceded. 'It's hard for him to move up too quickly. But he can certainly put himself in Gordon's mind.'

Strachan had implied that Gauld had been called up to the squad primarily to gain experience

He already did that, of course, the minute he signed for a giant club in Portugal for £3million. Scots footballers are not noted for extending their horizons much further than London.

Intelligent and educated, Gauld has taken the same bold road McGhee took himself when he left Aberdeen for Hamburg in the 1980s.

'I was asked when he went there what I thought about that, and I thought: 'It can only be good for him,'said McGhee.

'The mentality it will bring and the broader outlook in life and as a person will test him and challenge him and that can only be good for his game.'

Stevie May, the Sheffield Wednesday striker, is the other fresh addition to the squad for the forthcoming double header.

Asked how they have bedded in so far, McGhee offered an approving nod.

'Really well. We really only got a couple of minutes with them this morning in a match situation, Gordon is very pleased with both of them.

'He commented on Stevie's movement and touch – and Ryan took up a couple of positions where you could see he was doing the things Gordon has talked about quite naturally. That's just what he does. So he was well pleased with him.'

Nevertheless, Saturday is an unlikely day to field fresh blood for the first time.

McGhee, however, rejected the widespread notion that this is the first 'real' qualifier the latest management team have faced.

In the public mindset the last World Cup campaign was already over by the time they took control at the beginning of last year. For Strachan, any notion of an extended honeymoon will end swiftly if the Scots take anything less than four from six points against Georgia and Poland.

'I don't think we needed or demanded or expected a honeymoon period,' claimed McGhee.

'We took responsibility for the first two performances and results (defeats to Serbia and Wales) and we would have been quite happy to accept some form of criticism for them.

'Because we were just in the job you guys gave us a lot. We are grateful for that because if took some of the pressure off and let us develop things in our head. But I think it started then and it continues.'

Anything less than two reasonable results would be a blow to a Scottish game battered and buffeted by harsh financial winds.

Scotland performed well in their first Euro 2016 qualifier but lost 2-1 to Germany in Dortmund 

The national team have been a candle in the gloom in recent months and McGhee accepted that responsibility readily. 'Us winning every game in the campaign won't change the current predicament of the Scottish domestic game but, from the point of view of encouraging future footballers, it's always important.'

As a former Celtic striker, McGhee is relishing the prospect of an international game at Ibrox.

'It's a fantastic place to play, I loved playing at Ibrox and I think the players will gain something out of that. Our approach to the game will gain something from that. I think everything is possible.'

It's pretty unthinkable, in truth, that Scotland will do anything other than beat Georgia at home. 

Heading for Poland on Monday morning it's an imperative.

And yet McGhee sounded a note of caution when he added: 'We've looked at them, I went to see them at the end of last season. We've looked at all the videos we could look at, we looked very closely at the Ireland game (a 2-1 home defeat for the Georgians) and we're convinced what we're seeing is a decent team.

'But pretty much outside of Germany the rest of us are going to have the ability to win any of the games. We have a game on Saturday night, it's at home, and that gives you a lot of advantages.'
