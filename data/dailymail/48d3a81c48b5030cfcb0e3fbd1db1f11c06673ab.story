Two children have been left orphaned after three people, including a woman and her baby girl, were killed after their car slammed into a tree near Victoria's western border.

The driver, the 39-year-old father, died in hospital on Sunday afternoon after being trapped in the car for a number of hours.

Two other children, a young brother and sister were airlifted to the Royal Children's Hospital in Melbourne and survived with injuries - but have tragically been left orphaned by the horror crash.

Three people, including a woman and her baby girl, are dead after their car slammed into a tree in Victoria 

The father and driver of the car, 39, was trapped in the car for a number of hours but later died in hospital

The woman, 29, and baby died at the scene of the crash, which happened about 7.30am on Casterton-Penola Road, near Lake Mundi.

The boy, eight years old, arrived in hospital with critical injuries but it has since been revealed he is now in a stable condition, Nine News reported.

He is suffering from head and abdominal injuries according to Fairfax Media. 

His surviving sister, aged three, escaped the accident with only minor injuries. It is believed Sunday was her birthday.

The family are believed to be from Congolese, from Central Africa, but now living in South Australia.

They arrived in Mount Gambier just 18 months ago, and had returned from a reunion with family in the Congo just hours before the accident, according to The Advertiser.

The family has reportedly flown into Melbourne early on Sunday morning, immediately attempting the six hour drive home just after they stepped off the plane. 

The Conglonese community in Mount Gambier held a vigil in memory of the young family on Sunday night, and a woman who works at the son's school spoke on behalf of the family.

'They are absolutely destroyed ... they are just grieving because it was such a sudden accident,” she said,' Inna Tucker told The Advertiser.

The accident takes Victoria's road toll to 39, compared to 36 at the same time last year.

'They’d already been through so much as refugees, endured so much trauma ... they came here for a better and brighter future and it has ended up like this,' she added.

Superintendent Don Downs told the ABC it was a 'tragic collision' and part of a 'horror start' to the year in the area.

'People think they can drive in these back roads and there's not a big risk, but there is a big risk,' he said.

'When you come out to jobs like this it's heart-wrenching. Heart-wrenching on the community and heart-wrenching on the members who attended.' 

Victoria police say they think the driver may have missed a turn off, and fatigue may have been a factor in the horror crash.
