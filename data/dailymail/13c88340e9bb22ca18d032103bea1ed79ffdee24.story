A 47-year-old man will appear in court after allegedly setting fire to a box of books and cardboard and placing them outside the longest medieval cathedral in Europe, causing up to £3,000 of damage.

Sean Clements will face arson charges after the blaze severely damaged historic doors to the Grade I listed Winchester Cathedral, which dates back to 1150, as well as a number of antique books.

He was due to appear before magistrates today following the incident in Hampshire, charged with four counts of arson - including blazes at a restaurant and a clothing shop in Winchester city centre.

Wrecked: Sean Clements will face arson charges after the blaze severely damaged historic doors to the Grade I listed Winchester Cathedral, which dates back to 1150, as well as a number of antique books

Tourist attraction: Although the cathedral was largely rebuilt in the 17th century, some parts of the 12th century building remain - in particular the three-arched entrance portico where the fire was started

Clements, of Winchester, was also charged with causing actual bodily harm and three counts of racially aggravated public order offences and will appear at Basingstoke Magistrates’ Court.

The magnificent Deanery, where the books and cardboard were ignited, is on the grounds of the cathedral, which attracts more than 300,000 visitors each year and is popular with tourists.

The front door’s brown wood was badly scorched and blackened by fire, with damage estimated at from £2,000 to £3,000, while the triple-arched porch and gravel driveway were covered in debris.

Dozens of badly burned books lay at the entrance. They were understood to have been piled up by the door when the fire began before being pulled away by fire crews trying to protect the front door.

A fire extinguisher on its side lay on a bookcase by the entrance. Dozens of books were left outside in the entrance as part of a charity scheme to fund the education of the cathedral’s boy choristers.

The history of the Winchester Cathedral site dates back more than 15 centuries.

The first holy building there became known as Old Minster and was built around 650 A.D.

This soon became a cathedral and was the burial place for King Alfred the Great, King of Wessex, who died in 899 A.D.

It was the priory church of monks by the 10th century before being demolished and replaced by a new cathedral in the 11th century.

By the early 16th century, much of the cathedral that can be seen today was finished.

Now it is the seat of the Bishop of Winchester and is home to daily prayers and sacred music.

Members of the public donate books which are available for sale, either by volunteers manning the store or through an honesty system where money can be paid through a letterbox.

The Dean of Winchester Cathedral, the Very Reverend James Atwell, was away on a post-Christmas break and not in the building at the time of the blaze, which happened at 7pm on New Year’s Day.

Although the cathedral was largely rebuilt in the 17th century, some parts of the 12th century building remain - in particular the three-arched entrance portico where the fire was started.

A Hampshire Police spokesman said: ‘A fire was discovered at the entrance to the Deanery, a building which dates back to circa 1150 and is part of Winchester Cathedral grounds.

‘The fire caused substantial damage to the doors and a number of antique books. The damage is estimated to be in the region of £2,000 to £3,000 to the doors and the value of the damage to the books is yet to be estimated.’
