A sky-diving pensioner, who became an internet sensation after a video was posted of her seemingly refuse to get out the plane then dangerously hanging from the instructor when the dive went horribly wrong, has said she DID want to jump.

In the incredible Youtube video, 81-year-old Laverne Everett looks like she is clinging onto the plane’s door as if she changed her mind about the jump at the last minute.

However the thrill seeker has spoken out to say that she wasn’t forced out of the plane – as the footage appears to show but that her her knees gave way.

'Stop': The woman, 80, appears to yell 'no' as she tries to avoid jumping out of the plane in California

Skydiving goes wrong: The woman's back is exposed as she clings to her instructor after her harness slipped. The tandem diver grasps her tightly as they plummet towards the ground at 125mph

Daredevil: Laverne Everett, 81, has spoken out insisting that she did want to jump out the plane - in the video she appears to have been pushed

'No, I don’t look at it that way,' said Laverne when asked if she was pushed out the aircraft. '[The instructor] knew how bad I wanted to jump.'

Laverne, who admits to seeking out excitement, surprised her family when she announced that she wanted to jump out of a plane to celebrate entering her ninth decade.

'They thought I was very brave,' Laverne, from Oakdale, California, told CBS. 'But, it’s just something I’ve wanted to do for a long time.'

And she fulfilled her wish at the Sky Dive Lodi Parachute Center last May.

However the dive itself, which was all caught on camera then posted on Youtube by Laverne's sister, did not go as smoothly as expected.

After her harness came loose Laverne was left precariously dangling from her instructor as she hurtled towards the ground at 125mph. Furthermore, the daredevil could not see what was happening as her shirt flew up covering her face.

'The upper harness came off, you know. Just slipped down, it was just the lower harness, is all I had.'

High spirits: Laverne, 80, the tandem skydiver, said it was her first ever jump as she is filmed before take-off. She said she had been planning the leap for a decade

Smiling: Laverne looks at the camera as the plane makes it ascent in preparation for the jump

In the dramatic video, which has been seen more than 92,000 times on Youtube, the woman's tandem diver can be seen clinging onto her safety harness which had slipped down her legs during the jump in California.

As they plummet towards the ground, the woman's top flies up exposing her back to the high-speed winds.

The cameraman - a separate jumper filming the whole experience - comes over to help as the pair get into difficulties.

Just before the jump happened, the woman appears to yell 'no!' - telling her instructor to stop her getting out of the aircraft.

Struggle: After making the ascent, the woman apparently decided she did not want to make the jump which she had been planning for the last decade

Jump: With the woman appearing to resist, she plunges out of the plane. A British Parachute expert said the problems started because they were in the wrong position when they left the aircraft

It was her first skydive, which she had been planning for a decade, she says on the video which was published on TheChive.com.

'She was very close to slipping out,' he said. 'You can see from the video the instructor was trying to get to the harness and cling on to it. The person with the video camera was also trying to help.'

The Federal Aviation Administration confirmed it is now investigating what went wrong with the dive.

At the end of the video the woman can be seen on the ground apparently uninjured but is seen being given some careful attention. Even the instructor is traumatised and has to be consoled by a colleague.

Parachute jump: The woman, 80, and her tandem diver leap from the plane over California. Shortly after leaving the aircraft, they would have been travelling at 125mph

Descent: The separate parachute jumper videoing the jump captures the moment they tumble out of the aircraft

Descent: They plummet towards the ground - but problems quickly start as the woman's harness slips

Difficulties: The instructor clings onto the woman's harness as they get into trouble

Freezing: The woman's back is completely exposed to the elements and rushing wind as her jacket top flies up during the fall

Difficulties: The tandem skydivers hold on to each other as they fall towards the sun-scorched Californian earth

Topple: Rather than being strapped together, the two jumpers' legs are both pointing in different directions

Comforting: The instructor, left, and the woman jumper, 80, right, are helped after they made a successful and safe-landing in California
