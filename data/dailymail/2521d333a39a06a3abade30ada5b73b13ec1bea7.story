After a spell of beautifully mild weather over the last few days, residents in Cambridge were stunned to see a field of crocuses suddenly bloom to life.

The Mediterranean plant, often known as the Snow Crocus, traditionally blossoms in February after the snowdrops and before the daffodils.

But gardeners feared the flower would fail to materialise this year because of the unusually cold weather and late-falling snow.

Their fears were put at rest today though as the plant showed its resilience after hundreds of the violet flowers bloomed to create a stunning purple carpet along The Backs by Trinity College in Cambridge.

Onlookers stopped to admire the view of the lilac woodland crocus, also known as Crocus Tommasinianus, which has bloomed across the iconic city landscape in the balmy 16c heat.

Head gardeners at Cambridge University colleges had feared that recent heavy snowfall would damage the plants' growth.

Dennis Footman, head gardener at Trinity College, said: 'Initially, I was slightly worried that the heavy snowfall in the last month would have been too heavy for the crocuses to grow. But they have come through nicely bringing through a lot colour.'

But across the country, spring seemed well on its way today as flowers came out in force, as temperatures remained above the average 6c to 8c for this time of year.

And this appears just to be the start of fine weather to come as forecasters predict March will see temperatures rise to 27c.

Temperatures in the south today reached around 14c to 12c and even northern parts of the country reached the very early teens.

And while tonight and the start of tomorrow should remain dry for most, temperatures will drop to average for this time of year at around 6c to 8c, with rain expected at the beginning of next week.

But Met office forecasters had some good news today - predicting that the weather would warm up again mid-week.

Met office forecaster George Goodfellow said: 'It certainly hasn't been quite as warm as it has been over the last few days but temperatures are still above average for this time of year.

'It may rain in northern parts tomorrow into Monday morning but it should then start to brighten up again.

'The weather system is coming in from the Atlantic which is relatively warm this time of year but also brings a lot of moisture in with it.

'In some parts it looks as though the good weather could continue for the next 30 days.'

Yesterday Casablanca, in Morocco in northern Africa, was lagging behind Britain's warmest spots at 16C and Crete and the Eastern Mediterranean floundering on temperatures in the low teens.

In Lincolnshire, Holbeach went from suffering sub-zero temperatures of -15.6c to basking in an incredible 17.7c yesterday - a colossal swing of 33.3c.

Sun-seekers even headed to the beaches in Bournemouth to coastal area right up to the Midlands.

Yesterday’s high temperatures weren't high enough to threaten any records with warmest February day still set on February 13, 1998, in Greenwich, when the mercury reached 19.7c.

Met Office forecaster Sarah Holland said: ‘The wind has changed direction and is blowing from the south-west, bringing very mild weather from the Azores.

'This also means that we have a lot of cloud across the country, but this breaks up the further east you are.’
