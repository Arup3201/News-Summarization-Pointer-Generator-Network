There was not enough of an off-season break — there never is — but Dylan Hartley did his best to escape from rugby on the family farm during the summer, despite Kiwi attempts to keep his mind on the day job.

In the aftermath of England’s tour-ending capitulation against the All Blacks in Hamilton in June, Hartley retreated to Rotorua to catch up with relatives and unwind. But New Zealand is not a place to get away from the game, especially on the back of an absorbing Test series.

‘I stayed in New Zealand after the tour to spend time with my family,’ said Hartley as he geared up to lead Northampton’s defence of their Aviva Premiership title in the forthcoming season.

‘It was nice to go back to my parents’ farm. Some days I didn’t even leave the farm. I helped out. Every morning you have to feed the cows and stuff like that.

‘For my parents it’s probably a chore because before they can do anything they have to tend to the animals. But I enjoyed it.

‘It was funny because they have this rugby channel in New Zealand and every time I turned the TV on they were playing that last Test (which England lost 36-13). It was on all the time. I kind of avoided that!’

Despite the emphatic nature of that result in the series finale at Waikato Stadium, Stuart Lancaster’s team made a profound impression on the Kiwi rugby public by the manner in which they stood toe-to-toe with the world champions in the first two Tests. Hartley was enthused by the response of people he spoke to after the tour.

‘What was nice for me was when I stayed out in New Zealand, the amount of positive feedback I got from Kiwis,’ he said. ‘I think we raised a few eyebrows out there. Everyone was so complimentary about the way we conducted ourselves and the rugby we played — I think we put them under a bit of pressure. The most disappointing thing was that we did not get a result; not one Test win. If we want to go up the world rankings we need to close games out.

‘That was the review from the summer. We look forward to the World Cup. It is a year out now. It’s crazy, it is all going to happen pretty quickly.’

For Hartley and the rest of Northampton’s large England contingent, the more pressing priority for now is the defence of their Premiership title, dramatically secured in the last minute of extra-time at Twickenham in May. Soon after that glorious occasion, the hooker and several of his club mates were on their way to Auckland, so there was precious little time for reflection.

‘It all went so quick,’ said Hartley. ‘I didn’t get to enjoy the final as much as some of the other lads because we had to get on a plane and shoot off.’

The time for looking back with satisfaction has surely passed, for now. Hartley returned from New Zealand via California to catch up with the same friends who had provided a haven for him when he was stewing on the ban last year which shattered his Lions ambitions.

Since then, an annual trip to the V Festival by Hartley and a group of Saints players served as the ‘last hurrah’ before club hostilities resume against Gloucester at Franklin’s Gardens on September 5. Northampton have opted to consolidate rather than recruit, but the skipper backs that strategy.

‘We are stable and I don’t think we played our best rugby last season,’ he said. ‘There are no excuses about new players coming in. We have to perform from the off and be more consistent.’
