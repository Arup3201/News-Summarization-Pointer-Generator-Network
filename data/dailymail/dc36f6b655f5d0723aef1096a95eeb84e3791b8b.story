The creationists posted a message above Times Square in New York City this week that reads, ‘To all of our atheist friends: Thank God you're wrong.’ The video advertisement hangs above 42nd street and Eighth Avenue.

The creationists decided not to turn the other cheek after atheists posted billboards last December that read, ‘Keep the Merry, Dump the Myth!’, ‘Tell your family you don’t believe in Gods. They just might agree,’ and, ‘You know it’s a myth. This season celebrate reason.’

Anti-atheist billboards are going up in New York, San Francisco, and Los Angeles this week and are funded by Answers in Genesis.

Answers in Genesis, a multi-million dollar Christian Ministry, is responsible for the Creation Museum outside of Cincinnati.

Ken Ham, president of Answers in Genesis, claims that the God favouring billboards are not meant to ‘attack’ the atheists.

‘We're not against them personally. We're not trying to attack them personally, but we do believe they're wrong,’ he said.

The Creation Museum represents the creationist belief in a literal interpretation of the book of Genesis. They believe that the Earth was created in six days less than 10,000 years ago.

‘The Bible says to contend for the faith,’ Ham said. ‘We thought we should come up with something that would make a statement in the culture, a bold statement, and direct them to our website.’

This billboard posted by the American Atheists in December of last year started a billboard war between atheists and creationists

The American Atheists, the organization responsible for the atheist billboards, finds the creationist billboards humorous and without validity.

Dave Silverman, the president of the American Atheists said, ‘They refuse to look at the real world. They refuse to look at the evidence we have, and they offer none.’  He continued, ‘They might as well be saying, “Thank Zeus you're wrong” or “Thank Thor you're wrong.” ‘

Many American’s think the creationists are right. Studies provided by Gallup Inc. in June 2012, show that 46% of Americans believed in creationism, 32% believed in evolution guided by God, and 15% believed in atheistic evolution.

Creationism was the most popular answer for as long as Gallup conducted the survey.

According to Ham, ‘We're a biblical authority ministry. We're really on about the Bible and the Gospel. Now, we do have a specialty in the area of the creation account and Genesis because that's where we say God's word has come under attack.’

By ‘attack,’ Ham may be referring to the atheist billboards posted in December of 2012. A Former Minister named Dan Barker defended the atheist billboards last December.

‘I understand how [people] might feel that nonreligious displays during December “ridicule” the precious beliefs of Christians, but what is wrong with ridicule? What is wrong with protest, in this great country that cherishes the freedom of speech and the freedom of religion?,’ said Barker

Silverman said of the creationist billboards, ‘I would suggest, if they're actually trying to attract atheists, they should talk about proof and reason to believe in their god, not just some pithy play on words,’ Silverman said.

The Answers in Genesis is hoping to attract more creationist followers with their video ad campaign. IRS filings for Answers show a yearly operating budget of more than $25 million. Ham said the marketing budget is about 2% of that, about $500,000 a year.

The billboard war between the atheists and creationists may not have one winner yet, but one billboard certainly costs more than the other.

Silverman noted that his billboards were not video and cost approximately $25,000 last year. He said that more atheist billboards would be appearing soon.

The billboard war continues.
