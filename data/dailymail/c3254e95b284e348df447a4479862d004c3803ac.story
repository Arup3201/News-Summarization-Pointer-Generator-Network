Residents of Dubai are in for a spectacle this weekend as the breath-taking Breitling Wingwalkers take over the city's airspace.

Britons Danielle Hughes and Emily Guilding will be performing for the first time above Dubai's popular beachfront area - as part of the 2014 UIM Skydive Dubai XCAT World Powerboating Series.

The fearless women, who perform their high-octane manoeuvres amid gusting 100mph winds, walk along the wings of two 1930's Boeing Stearman biplanes.

Their aerial stunts include riding on top of the wings and even performing an elegant gymnastics routine - despite high G-forces.

The UK-based team is well known at air shows around the world and have performed above China, Australia, Kuwait and their British homeland.

This weekend, the Wingwalkers will be taking off from the Skydive Dubai runway, displaying formation aerobatics and daring cross manoeuvres.

'We are thrilled to have the Breitling Wingwalkers performing at this weekend's Emirates Airline XCAT GP, which is the final round of the 2014 UIM Skydive Dubai XCAT World Series,' said H.E. Dr Saif Al Ketbi, president of the WPPA, the event's organisers.

The planes have been upgraded with 450-horsepower engines to allow for aerobatic stunts

'There is a great synergy between them and XCAT racing, which is all about high speed thrill and entertainment,' he added.

Later, they served as crop dusters and general utility aircraft.

However, they've since been upgraded with 450-horsepower engines to allow the planes to perform these aerobatic stunts.
