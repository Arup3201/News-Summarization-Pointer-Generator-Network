Europe's golfers this morning gave a tempered response to Phil Mickelson's mini-salvo about Rory McIlroy and Graeme McDowell 'litigating' against each other.

Martin Kaymer questioned whether the American's pointed observation was necessary but said that, more than anything, he found Mickelson's comments amusing.

As part of what appeared to be a concerted effort by the home side not to ratchet up tension ahead of Friday's start talisman Ian Poulter also failed to bite back at the USA side, preferring to assure that McDowell and McIlroy still get on well together.

On Tuesday Mickelson had deliberately brought up the elephant in the Europe team room, the fact that McIlroy is suing his former management company, in which McDowell is a shareholder, as well as a client.

'Phil's comment, it's not a topic for us. It's one of those things, you read it, you laugh about it and that's it,' he said. 'I heard about it yesterday but I think in the end of the day we should just play golf. It's fairly simple. If things like this start it's a little… I don't know if that's necessary.'

Poulter dismissed any notion that there was a problem between the two Northern Irishmen off the course. 'I did see the comments, but you need to see how Rory and G-Mac are in the team room, they are very comfortable. There's no animosity there whatsoever, the guys are good. So I just have to laugh at the comment.'

He also denied that there was any psychological angle at work with the Americans trying to disrupt the team that has beaten them with such regularity.

'I don't think there's mind games being put out there. Both teams want to win this trophy. We've had the upper hand in the past decade but you look at the board and there's still more red, white and blue on it than there is European blue.'

Justin Rose was also diplomatic, saying: 'It's a bit of banter and getting things going. We don't have a problem with that at all. 

'There's no real angst between the players and in our team room it's a non-issue. I've obviously been observing Rory and G-Mac and they have been getting on great and hanging out and having dinners together. The atmosphere is fantastic in our team room.'
