A mother has spoken of her despair at not being able to find any shoes that fit her son, who was born with a rare deformity.

Jack Duncan-Hale was born with cleft feet, which appear as though they are split down the middle, with his toes protruding outwards to the sides.

Due to the extent of his condition, the four-year-old cannot wear ordinary footwear. 

Jack has three toes on each foot which vary between a size 12.5 and 13.5, and he needs specialist footwear which is individually moulded for him. 

Jack Duncan-Hale (with his mother, Kim) was born with cleft feet, which appear as though they are split down the middle, with his toes protruding outwards to the sides

The four-year-old has three toes on each foot which vary between a size 12.5 and 13.5, and he needs specialist footwear which is individually moulded for him.

He has now outgrown a pair of orthopaedic shoes he was given when he was much younger, and needs specially made footwear so he can walk and play.

But Jack's desperate mother, Kim Hale, cannot afford to pay the £2,000 she has been quoted by a specialist cobbler.

Ms Hale, of Podsmead, Gloucester, said: 'I have been trying to do everything and I am just going around in circles.

'He has no shoes at all. He did have orthopaedic shoes but he cannot wear them any more as they don't fit him.

'You have to see his feet to believe it - this is such a rare condition.

'When he was younger it didn't really affect him but now he is walking a lot more his feet swell up.'

She is now appealing to the public to help her find an alternative.  'He needs special shoes but I can't get funding anywhere. 

'My GP has done everything he can and the school I can't thank enough because they have been trying their hardest.'

Cleft foot is a rare congenital anomaly that causes the affected foot to have missing toes, a V-shaped cleft and other anatomical differences.

The condition is generally thought to have a genetic cause. It can occur by itself, or with a cleft handIt is very rare, affecting fewer than 1 in one million babies.
