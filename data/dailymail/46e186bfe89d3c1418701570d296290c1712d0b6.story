It is one of the stranger new beauty trends – but it seems snail slime facials could be about to hit the big time.

After a Tokyo salon revealed it charges clients £161 to have live snails glide over them, a French snail farmer has devised a secret way of harvesting mucus from thousands of the creatures.

Louis-Marie Guedon says the slime is full of collagen, glycolic acid, antibiotics and compounds that regenerate skin cells.

Mr Guedon, of Champagnolles in western
France, is busy creating the country’s first industrial snail mucus 
business – and aims to gather 15 tons next year.

The 130,000 euro (£112,000) project 
was partly financed by small business subsidies from the French 
government and the European Union.

Mr Guedon, 47, who has raised snails 
for a quarter of a century, said: ‘I’ve been producing the slime for 
three years, but manually.’

He is hoping to make serious profits 
and has supply contracts with three local cosmetics laboratories and a 
Paris company that sells to the industry’s top names.

‘This client has ordered three tons of slime,’ he said.

Mr Guedon sells 25million baby snails a year to other farmers from breeding stock of 650,000 garden snails.

He preferred not to give details of 
his extraction process, but said the snails are put in two large 
containers. Mucus is extracted, filtered and chilled. Salt is used, but 
the snails are not killed.

The slime has already been used in beauty products sold in Asia and South America, but has yet to catch on in Europe
