Languishing in filthy conditions with little food or water, puppies bred on a Polish farm face a long and arduous journey.

Their destination? The UK, where they will be sold at a huge profit to unsuspecting dog-lovers who have no idea where they came from.

The cruel trade is booming after Britain relaxed import rules two years ago to meet EU guidelines. Since then, thousands of dogs have been brought into the country from Eastern Europe, many in poor health and with no vaccinations.

The Daily Mail accompanied animal welfare charity Four Paws as officials confiscated 12 dogs on a filthy small-scale farm in the Lipno district of rural Poland. 

Two German shepherd puppies were found lying in the basement of a dark and filthy outbuilding. Their only food was rotten pig’s intestines, which lay stinking on the damp concrete floor.

The breeding dogs also included cocker spaniels, with bleeding ears and matted calloused paws.

Julie Sanders, Four Paws UK country manager, said breeders were selling their pedigree puppies at Polish markets for less than £100 to unscrupulous dealers. Once in Britain, they can fetch up to £850.

‘The puppies are often badly treated and in poor health,’ said Miss Saunders. ‘Some are as young as four weeks old when sold, far younger than the legal limit of  15 weeks.

‘Taken too young from their mothers, they are transported hundreds of miles to reach the UK. This is organised international crime with a network of people making a profit at every stage.’

Britain relaxed its pet passport scheme in 2012, meaning pet owners no longer needed to wait six months after a rabies vaccination before entering the country.

The change triggered a surge in the number of puppies being brought over for sale from Eastern Europe.

Between 2011 and 2012, imports to the UK rose 1,150 per cent from Romania, 450 per cent from Hungary, 507 per cent from Lithuania and 183 per cent from Poland.

Under the rules, five puppies can be brought in per person for non-commercial purposes. But many dealers bring them in en masse.

Others enter with forged vaccination documents – putting Britain at risk of rabies.

At a puppy market in Słomczyn, central Poland, the Mail spoke to Mathius, a burly trader with two dachshunds tucked into his jacket.

Standing next to cots, cages and cardboard boxes full of thoroughbreds, he smirked as he boasted of how easy it is to import dogs into Britain.‘We sell to the UK all the time,’  he said.

‘What kind of puppies do you want? French bulldogs, chihuahuas? It is not a problem.’

At
 the same market, a man called Roman was offering to sell a miniature 
pinscher for £200, saying it was the last of his litter.

Holding the shaking ‘handbag dog’, the
 middle-aged man said the fur on the puppy’s head would grow back ‘once 
 it is in the daylight’.

‘It has been living in the dark, indoors, so the hair does not grow,’ he added.

Holding the puppy in one hand, he told the Mail: ‘This is a very good price. My daughter lived in Scotland and these dogs are 3,000 zloty there (£600). This is much cheaper than the UK.’

Once in Britain, the Eastern European dealers sell the puppies either over the internet or on to UK traders who pick them up from petrol stations or car parks near the ports or motorways.

The British dealers then sell the animals on from their own homes, pretending they are home-bred.

According to Government figures, the number of dogs which entered from Poland, Romania, Hungary and Lithuania rose from 2,000 to 12,000 between 2011 and 2013.

Jim Fitzpatrick, Labour MP for London’s Poplar and Limehouse, raised the startling statistics in Parliament last month. He said: ‘The rules regarding the importation of dogs appear to be completely useless when you look at the huge number of animals which are coming into the UK.

'None of them, not a single one, was supposedly brought in for commercial purposes. It defies belief.

'Many people are then buying these puppies in Britain mistakenly, in the belief they have the appropriate paperwork, when it is either forged or incomplete.’

Animal charities have warned Britain is at risk of rabies, a disease the country has been free from since 1922. David Bowles, of the RSPCA, said: ‘We have a big dog population in the UK and are a nation of pet owners.

‘The criminal gangs have realised it is a good market and they can make quick money here.

‘The puppy farms we have seen in Hungary have been horrific, with very little daylight.

‘They are kept as breeding machines to churn out puppies and then transported in a transit van across Europe. The chances of getting caught are very low.’

But he warned that pet owners  risk being landed with a large bill if they accidentally buy a dog with no vaccinations from a puppy farm.

‘A lot of these animals are suffering from terrible diseases such  as parvovirus, leishmaniasis, and echinococcus, which are prevalent in these countries in Eastern Europe,’ he said.

‘The owners are also taking a risk. If they take their dog to be registered with a vet and the vet finds the dog has not been micro-chipped or vaccinated then the dog will have to go into quarantine for six months and the owner will have to pay for that.

‘It is never worth trying to get a bargain basement puppy – for the animal or the owner.’
