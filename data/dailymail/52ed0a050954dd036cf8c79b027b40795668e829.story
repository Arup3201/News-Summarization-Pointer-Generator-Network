Selfridges believe shoppers no longer want to be limited by their gender (pictured is brand KTZ which the store says is increasingly popular with consumers wanting a more androgynous style)

From Grace Jones' angular suits to David Bowie's androgynous costumes, fashion icons have never been scared to experiment with gender.

Now Selfridges is launching 'gender-neutral' shopping to allow consumers to buy clothes without being restricted to men's or women's fashions.

The Oxford Street department store has announced it will be axing its separate women and menswear  departments in favour of three floors of unisex fashion. It is also getting rid of its traditional mannequins.

Selfridges  believe that shoppers no longer want to be defined or limited by their gender as to what they can wear. Instead they are able to shop for unisex or 'agender' clothing. 

'We want to take our customers on a journey where they can shop and dress without limitations or stereotypes,' the store told The Times. 'A space where clothing is no longer imbued with directive gender values, enabling fashion to exist as a purer expression of 'self.'' 

Selfridges have launched five unisex collections and 'agender' pieces from forty of its regular brands. Beauty products and accessories for men and women will also be mixed.

Brands at the store, such as KTZ, Trapstar and Hood By Air, are already popular with  women looking for a more androgynous style. 

While the unisex Boy London  saw a massive surge in popularity when singer Rhianna was seen sporting their range.

It comes as Selfridges bosses say they have seen a huge surge in women buying menswear as part of the trends for looser clothing and more masculine tailoring this year.

Several designers last year experimented with gender-neutral fashion while Vivienne Westwood's AW14 womenswear collection was inspired by androgynous pinup Tilda Swinton.

And Eastie Empire, originally a menswear brand, has previously launched a gender neutral line after its designer Sara Weston said she noticed female clients were buying from the range.

Jane Shepper, chief executive of Whistles which has  collaboration with Swedish company Stutterheim to create unisex raincoats, said the line between men and womenswear was becoming blurred.

'A lot of our men's collection influences our women's and vice versa,' she added.

Cos and Gap have all noticed increases in the number of women buying menswear, while men have also been picking up women's knitwear for themselves.

While there has been a swathe of high-profile unisex models,  such as Elliott Sailors, who  work for both mens and womenswear brands.
