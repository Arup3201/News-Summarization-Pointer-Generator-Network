Luke Shaw believes that he can ‘handle
 the pressure’ after sealing a £31.5million move to Manchester United on
 Friday afternoon to become the most expensive teenager in world 
football.

IIt is 
weird to think that it is only two years since I was playing against the
 United under-18’s,’ Shaw said, in an interview with MUTV,

‘Now I am 
signing for the club. At Southampton, I have learned to handle the 
pressure and I can keep doing what I am doing and improve. I want to 
come in for pre-season and show the new gaffer what I can do.’

The former Southampton left-back admitted that the move United, who he describes as ‘the biggest club in the world’, has been in the pipeline for some time and that he had also hoped it may have been concluded before he headed off to Brazil as part of England’s World Cup squad.

'It’s been going on for quite a long time now,’ Shaw revealed, ‘I have known for a number of weeks that United were interested in me and I was hoping it might be done before the World Cup. It wasn’t but now I’m finally here and I am very pleased and I can’t believe it has happened.

'United are the biggest club in the world and they are always going to be up there with the best. The main reason I have come here is because they want to win trophies and so do I. As a young lad, I want to be winning trophies and that’s the one thing they like to do.’

Shaw was initially targeted by former 
United boss David Moyes, who was sacked in April, with the Glaswegian 
laying much of the groundwork for the summer transfer but the England 
international spoke on Friday of his excitement about playing under new 
manager Louis van Gaal, who has impressed at the World Cup as the 
manager of the Holland national team.

Shaw
 said: ‘I’ve seen how Louis van Gaal plays at the World Cup, I have been
 watching the games and I know he likes to play an attacking game so 
that’s how I present my game. I am very excited to speak to him. He 
likes to play attacking full-backs and that’s something I love doing so I
 am looking forward to working under him. I can’t wait to meet everyone 
and get started.’

Shaw 
revealed that he had discussed the impending move at length with his new
 United team-mates at the World Cup, with Wayne Rooney, Danny Welbeck, 
Chris Smalling and Phil Jones all in Brazil with Roy Hodgson’s England 
squad.

‘I spoke to 
them out there,’ Shaw explained, ‘They were asking me what was happening
 because there were a lot of ongoing conversations in the media. It was 
good to get to know them before coming here. It’s a big thing for me 
because if I had come here not knowing anyone, then it is quite hard as a
 young guy and it can be a hard environment. To know four of the lads 
makes it a lot better for me.’

Green light: Louis van Gaal has given his blessing for the deal to go ahead to bring in Luke Shaw

It
 is understood that Shaw, who has signed a four year contract at Old 
Trafford with the option of another year, has been told that he will be 
the club’s first-choice left-back next season as Van Gaal looks to ease 
the burden on 33-year-old Frenchman Patrice Evra, who will act as a 
mentor to the teenage starlet.

'I’m
 really excited to be working with him (Patrice). He has been one of the
 best left-backs in the league for some time now and hopefully I can 
learn a lot off him.’

The
 new United man also thanked Southampton for nurturing his talent, 
adding:  ‘They meant the world to me, I have been there since the age of
 8-year-old. They have shown both me and my family such great respect 
and there will always be a place in my heart for Southampton. I have 
been there for 10 years and I have loved every minute of it.’
