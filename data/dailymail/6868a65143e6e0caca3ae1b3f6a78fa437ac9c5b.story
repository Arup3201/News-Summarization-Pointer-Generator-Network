Fernando Torres has been left out of Chelsea's squad to face Leicester at Stamford Bridge on Saturday.

The Spanish striker was an unused substitute in Chelsea's 3-1 win over Burnley on Monday night and has been linked with a Stamford Bridge exit this summer.

Jose Mourinho has brought in both Diego Costa and Didier Drogba during the transfer window, bolstering his team's attacking options.

Torres, who joined in a £50m move from Liverpool in January 2011, was linked with a move to Roma with Mattia Destro going the other way.

Belgian international Thibaut Courtois, meanwhile, retained his place in goal against Leicester ahead of Petr Cech.

Veteran Cech was on the bench once again as he had been at Burnley.

Summer signings Filipe Luis and Drogba, returning to his old club, were also both among the substitutes.
