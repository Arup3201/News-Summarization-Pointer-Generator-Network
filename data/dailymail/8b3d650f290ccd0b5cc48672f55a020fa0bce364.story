Elizabeth 'Beanie' Esteve: She will be allowed to hold divorce proceedings in London after her husband's appeal failed

The multi-million pound divorce of a couple who enjoyed a jetsetting lifestyle must be fought on an English battleground, the Court of Appeal has ruled.

Pyrros Vardinoyannis, 41, a scion of a Greek shipping dynasty, and his glamorous Brazilian heiress wife, Elizabeth, 38, met in St Tropez in 2001.

Although they initially lived in London, the couple spent time in Los Angeles, Sao Paulo, Milan, Crete and Gstaad.

Last year, while Mr Vardinoyannis was in Switzerland and his wife was in London, she petitioned for divorce in this country.

Lawyers for Mr Vardinoyannis tried to stop his wife – known to her friends as Beanie Esteve – pursuing her divorce in the notoriously generous English courts. London has been called the ‘divorce capital of the world’, attracting wives as ‘divorce tourists’ seeking bumper payouts.

He disputed her claim to have lived in London for the 12 months before she filed for divorce, since she had spent months in Crete and Switzerland.

Ruling against the husband at the 
High Court earlier this year, Mr Justice Peter Jackson said moving 
around was a feature of the family’s lifestyle, and now the Court of 
Appeal has upheld the decision.

The
ruling means the divorce battle, which has already run up legal costs 
of well over £1million, will go ahead in front of an English judge.

‘Just as there are multinational companies, so this is a multinational family,’ Mr Justice Jackson said in his judgement.

‘Their lives have not been tied down 
by mundane considerations such as financial budgets, local connections, 
immigration restrictions or language limitations.

‘Instead,
they have lived a protracted modern version of the 18th-century Grand 
Tour, gravitating towards places where the moneyed international social 
set gathers.

‘The 
husband, in particular, appeared to struggle in evidence to comprehend 
the concept of “home” as applying to his family at all. They have . . . 
shallow roots.’

Happier times: Elizabeth Esteve and Pyrrhos Vardinoyannis in 2005. They now live separately in London

Mr Vardinoyannis, who describes himself as a private investor, grew up in Switzerland, attended university in the U.S. and moved to London in 1994.

His wife was born and brought up in Brazil, went to school in Switzerland and the U.S., university in Paris, then attended an art course in London and worked in a gallery in New York. The couple married in 2003.

Rejecting the appeal, Lord Justice Thorpe, who sat with Lord Justice Longmore and Lord Justice McFarlane, said: ‘The requirement of European law does not stipulate for her presence, but only for her residence here.’

The family home in Kensington, West London, has been sold but the couple, who have two children, now live separately in the capital.
