Research In Motion has turned down takeover overtures from Amazon and other potential buyers because the BlackBerry maker prefers to fix its problems on its own, according to sources.

Amazon hired an investment bank this summer to review a potential merger with RIM, but it did not make a formal offer, said one of the sources.

It is not clear whether informal discussions between Amazon and RIM ever led to specific price talk, or who else had approached RIM about a takeover.    

Talks: Amazon considered buying RIM, but made no formal offer, say industry insiders

RIM's board wants co-chief executives Mike Lazaridis and Jim Balsillie to focus on trying to turn around the business through the launch of new phones, better use of assets such as BlackBerry Messaging and restructuring, two sources said.

They did not want to be identified as the discussions are private.

RIM and Amazon declined to comment.

At the moment Blackberry is trying to make sure that delays to its new touchscreen phones don’t harm the business.

Trouble ahead? Blackberry's new phone (not shown) has been delayed until late 2012, which analysts say could damage profits

The new devices are designed to update the smartphone brand for consumers used to iPhones and other touch handsets such as Android, but have been delayed until the end of next year.

It's a delay that some analysts predict could be disastrous for the company.

The touchscreen BB10 phones were crucial to updating the brand.

The co-CEOs insisted that BlackBerry can hold out - but admitted that BlackBerry sales were falling month by month, and that net income had fallen 71 per cent.

Earlier this year, BlackBerry also ran into trademark difficulties for the new operating system - BBX - and renamed the phones BB10 to avoid a dispute.

No official name or spec for any of the handsets has yet been revealed.

Shots of an angular handset supposedly known as BlackBerry London leaked earlier this month.

The phones will run an operating system that's mid-way between the simple, old-style operating system of current BlackBerries, and the more iPad-esque OS of the recent BlackBerry PlayBook.

PlayBook was another disaster for the company, with the seven-inch tablet sold at a damaging loss after customers failed to take an interest.

PlayBook required a BlackBerry phone 'tethered' to it for email to work - unlike any other tablet on the market.

Peter Misek, an analyst at Jefferies & Co in New York, said the company needs to get its new phones out fast.

Mike Lazaridis, one of the company's co-CEOs, said the BlackBerry 10 phones will need a new chipset that will not be available until mid-2012, so the company expects the new phones to ship late in the year.

'We've experienced a delay,' he said.

Analysts say RIM's future depends on the new software.
