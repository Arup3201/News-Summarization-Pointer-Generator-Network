Royal Ascot scorer Born In Bombay has been sold out of the stable of Andrew Balding and will continue his racing career in Hong Kong.

The royal trainer revealed the winner of the Britannia Stakes was heading for the Far East as he unveiled his team for Glorious Goodwood which is headed by Neptune Investment Management Gordon Stakes hope Scotland and Artemis Goodwood Cup entry Whiplash Willie.

Balding said: ‘He is in quarantine already and is off to Hong Kong. I don’t know which trainer here is going to but it was a very good offer.’

Balding has had six winners at Glorious Goodwood, which starts on July 29, with the first being supplied by international moneyspinner Phoenix Reach in the 2003 Gordon Stakes.

Balding hopes that mile-and-a-half race, run on the second day of the fixture, will provide a springboard for a tilt at the St Leger for Scotland who third to King George VI & Queen Elizabeth Stakes supplementary entry Eagle Top in the King Edward VII Stakes at Royal Ascot.

The one-time Derby entry missed a date at Epsom after finishing third to Orchestra in the Chester Vase.

Balding said: ‘The ground was as quick as Scotland wanted at Royal Ascot and I wouldn’t want to run twice on really quick ground.

‘But he is in really good form and ran a very good race in the King Edward VII Stakes.

‘He looks a Leger horse in the making and the intention is to use the Gordon Stakes as a trial. It was a good decision to miss the Derby. He probably a needed a couple of runs in the spring and took a bit of time to come to himself.’

Balding is also hoping that ground does 
not get too fast for his fragile Goodwood Cup hope Whiplash Willie, who 
has been forced to miss two outings because of quick going.

The six-year-old, a son of Phoenix Reach, has raced only 11 times during his career. The disruption, caused by a tendon injury, has not caused Balding to lose faith in his stayer who looks like having to take on the Queen’s 2013 Ascot Gold Cup winner Estimate and last year’s Goodwood Cup winner, Michael Owen-owned Brown Panther.

The trainer said: ‘He was due to run in the St Leger in his  three-year-old career and got a problem before the race and missed two years.

‘We thought plenty of him at the time and his owners have been very patient with him. I hope he would have place prospects at least.’

Balding’s team of handicappers for Goodwood include Van Percy, unplaced from a bad draw in the Northumberland Plate, in the Bet365 Summer Plate and Zanetto in the32Red Stewards’ Cup.

Montaly, fifth to Hartnell in the Queen’s Vase at Royal Ascot, goes for the Glorious Goodwood Stakes.
