At 22, Stephanie Gilmore was on top of the world with four surfing world championships under her belt.

But in December 2010, the young champion's whole life came to stand still after a random attack left her in emotional turmoil with head and wrist injuries to boot.

Now, the 25-year-old from New South Wales and the subject of the feature film Stephanie In The Water, has spoken out about how she overcame her trauma to rise back to the top of the surfing league.

Ms Gilmore describes her attack as the day 'the whole universe just flipped upside down'. 

She had been making her way back to her apartment in Coolangatta, New South Wales, when she noticed a random man from a car park she'd walked through, run at her with a metal bar in one hand. 

'The first time, he hit me in the head. I saw blood all over everything. I put my left wrist up to protect myself, and the second hit snapped my ulna and tore ligaments in my wrist,' she told ESPN news.

'I looked down and saw a big lump on my wrist. My body went into survival mode, and at the time, I didn't feel pain.'

The 25-year-old revealed the emotional toll a random attack took on her in 2010, when she was left with head and wrist injuries 

Her attacker was eventually jailed for four years, but the incident left her with both physical and emotional scars that would see her struggle in her next competition and only take out third place.

The professional athlete was told by her doctors that she would have to spend the following six weeks, just before her next competition, out of the water.

'I lost my rhythm…I realised it was going to take more than just natural talent and intuition to win this world title,' she said of her time in Brazil in 2011.

By 2012, after finally putting in that extra effort and giving it her all, Gilmore came away with her fifth world title in France.

'In 2011 and 2012, I really had to fight for something and I felt like I'd never really had to do that before,' she told Fairfax.

'Even chasing a sixth world title right now, I really have to work for it.'

Since recovering from the attack, the the Laureus World Sports Award recipient claims her perspective on life and sport has changed.

'I've definitely moved on and I've learnt a lot from it and I've grown from that. In a sense, I've appreciated it for having happened and being able to move on,' she said.

This year she won the Swatch Womens Pro, defeating Sally Fitzgibbons in the final on September 18 in California
