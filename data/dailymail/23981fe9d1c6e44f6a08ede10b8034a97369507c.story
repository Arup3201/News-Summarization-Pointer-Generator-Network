Sheila Thomas, now 64, was just 17 when, on Boxing Day 1967, she gave birth to her much-loved baby daughter Jacqueline.

But as an unmarried mother at a time when single parenthood was frowned upon, she had just six weeks with her child before she was taken away from her forever.

Now, almost half a century on, Sheila says she has never been able to have other children because she 'didn't deserve to'.

Reunited: Sheila Thomas, right, was forced to give up her daughter Jacqui when she was just six weeks old

'I knew 
that I couldn’t [have children] because I would be a bad mother,' she says, tears welling up in her eyes.

'I don’t
 deserve children. I gave one away, how could I? I just gave her away 
without a fight.

'I
 don’t see myself as a mother now, I can’t see myself as a mother,' she continues. 'I 
haven’t had that real opportunity of bringing a child up all through the
 trials and tribulations that kids go through. I haven’t done it.'

Sheila, who now lives in Sussex, was born and brought up in a south London semi, where she lived with her mother, father, two brothers and grandmother.

'My life now is a world away from where I grew up,' she explains. 'We lived in a three up two down in south London and there was my mum and my dad, myself, my two brothers and my nan in the front room, which meant we only had the back room for the five of us. It was tight, it was tight.' 

Tragic: Like Philomena Lee, whose life was turned into a film, Sheila never gave up hope of finding Jacqui

Sad: Although the real Philomena's search ended sadly, Sheila got a happy ending

Aged 15, she left school and got a job as a receptionist. But it wasn't long before she found herself caught up in a relationship with an older married man.

'I was bowled over by him,' she remembers. 'I felt like a silly schoolgirl. It was exciting. The whole situation took us both by surprise, I think. He was the one. I fell completely in love with him.'

But within a year of striking up the relationship, Sheila discovered that she was pregnant. 'I was 17 and I was frightened,' she says.

'My boyfriend was married so I couldn't turn to him. I couldn't ask him for help. I thought, "This can't be happening, it can't be true".

'When the time came and I couldn't hide it any longer, I had to finally face my parents. I told them and I had no idea what was going to happen. But mum and dad, they took charge.'

She broke up with her boyfriend and gave up her job, while her parents found a mother and baby home for her to go to.

On Boxing Day 1967, she gave birth to her baby daughter, Jacqueline. 'It was amazing when I first held her,' remembers Sheila.

'I thought, "Wow! I, me, have had a baby. I just need to look after this child now. That bond. It's so strong. It didn't dawn on me that that child would be taken away from me.'

Unbeknown to Sheila, her parents had made arrangements to have the baby given up for adoption and when the time came, she felt she had no alternative but to go along with their plans.

'A lady came in from the side and she said I'm going to take your child now,' she remembers. 'And she picked her up and I said: "Are you going to keep her name?"'

Coldly, the woman replied: 'I can't tell you that.' And with that, Sheila's baby was gone. 'The double doors opened and she was gone,' says Sheila. 'That's when it dawns on you, she has gone.

'I don't know how I could have done it, how I could have gone along with it,' she adds. 'I should have said, "Mum, come on. We can make this work, other people do it, why can't we?" But I never did, I never said it.'

10 years later, Sheila met and married her husband David and moved to Sussex, But the couple never had children of their own.

Notorious: Mother and baby homes such as this one in Chester were once to be found all over the country

'David and I found each other and before 
we got engaged, we said we didn't want children. I felt that it would be slightly 
disrespectful to Jacqueline.

'How could I have a child and give her away?
 How could I have done it?'

But things are finally looking up for Sheila after she was reunited with her daughter with the help of ITV documentary, Long Lost Family.

Jacqueline, who much to Sheila's delight is still called Jacqueline, lives in Kent with her 13-year-old daughter and says that she believes her mother did the right thing.

'I've always known [I was adopted],' she says. 'I cannot remember a 
time when I was sat down and told. The right thing 
happened for me and it all worked out well.'

'I knew immediately it was her,' said a delighted Sheila immediately after their reunion. 'Her eyes lit up when she saw me and she held out her arms to me and that was the best hug ever.

'I just want to be a little part in her life, just a little bit in the background,' she continued. 'It's time we go forward now.'

Sheila and Jacqueline appear on Long Lost Families, tonight at 9pm on ITV
