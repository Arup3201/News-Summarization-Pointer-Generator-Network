Sportsmail columnist MARTIN KEOWN answered YOUR questions after an entertaining week in the Champions League and the FA Cup.

Chelsea were knocked out by PSG on Wednesday night, with subjects ranging from the referee's performance, Zlatan Ibrahimovic's comments on the Blues being 'babies', David Luiz's return and whether the Premier League is still the best in the world.

Also, Arsenal overcame their Old Trafford hoo-doo to beat Manchester United on Monday night, and the former Gunners legend was at the game. But what was that 'money' sign to Arsene Wenger all about?

You can read all the answers below.

Host commentator

It’s certainly a good way to sum it up. If you think about how you’d react in that situation, he didn’t know whether to laugh or be angry. He probably thought the referee had got it so wrong, and everyone could see it, that he’d get off the hook.

The controlled reaction of the Chelsea players was definitely a factor in the red card. Many years ago, when I was playing under George Graham against United, he accused us of being too nice during half-time. He said we had to get around the referee as they were influencing every decision.

From that day, I contested every decision, almost giving the referee a running commentary. I would often say, ‘who’s in charge, them or you?’. There’s nothing worse for a referee to hear.

I appreciated why people don’t like to see it, but as well as influencing the referee, it makes you fight and compete for everything. It makes you more alive and puts your receptors on red alert. It’s like a game within a game, and believe me, it works.

Niall came into the game quite late. As a youngster he did his A-levels and his club Reading helped him through.

Just recently he’s turned a huge corner, particularly since Steve Clarke was appointed and started involving him in first-team training. Ireland asked about him last year, but he had an operation, which curtailed his development. Now he’s in the Under 21 squad and we’re very proud.

It looks ironic, given that I played for England, but a lot of my family were shocked I didn’t play for Ireland as I come from a big Irish family.

I could have played with as much passion for Ireland as I did for England, and it’s Niall’s right to play for Ireland, too.

It was a clear demonstration from United that he’s not going to be a part of their future. We know he hasn’t played well, and he looks like he’s lost some sharpness because of his knee injury. Though his last contribution for United, winning a penalty against Sunderland, was very important and has been largely overlooked. He hasn’t played since!

I think letting him go is probably the right call though. He’s not sharp enough, and doesn’t strike fear into the opposition. He looks to have given up trying to certain extent.

I think Van Gaal is largely responsible for United’s situation at the moment though, not the players. Man management was Sir Alex Ferguson’s forte, and some players find it harder to cope than others.

Mangers have to work with players’ minds, bodies and hearts. And when all is not right in their mind they will react to everything. It feels like Van Gaal has created this environment. Fergie would squeeze every ounce out of his players.

If he were still there, they wouldn’t be so far away from top of league.

I don’t blame either of them, Ben. They were shown the door, so why not?

When Roman Abramovich first took over at Chelsea, he offered a lot of money for Thierry Henry, but Arsenal refused and Henry was flattered by it. I think Luiz would have been half-hoping for that same reaction from Chelsea.

As for Welbeck, he’s a young man early in his career and was never really given a chance as a centre forward – his preferred role. And then there were the unnecessary comments from Van Gaal, claiming Welbeck was only good enough to be a substitute at United.

He wanted to fulfill his dreams at United and he had to listen to that. Now he has the chance to fulfill his dreams with Arsenal.

Everyone in the studio thought it was so funny. It’s like showing a montage of Gary [Lineker]'s misses! I was trying to explain that Andy Cole’s run takes me off Giggs’s line so I ended up caught in the middle. 

My most vivid memory is from after the game when I went into United dressing room to show some respect, but they were in full celebration mode and didn’t show a great deal of respect to us.

I felt I had to say something though, it was an epic battle. But they weren’t better than us that day, put it that way...

I had to have my smile surgically removed! It was fantastic.

I must admit, I was surprised at how many of the young United fans in the ground wanted photos with me and autographs. They were very respectful.

I had to walk through the United fans to get to the gantry, and it was a bit intimidating, but overall it was fine. Maybe, because the fans were so young, that hadn’t seen everything that used to go on!

There was one occasion when I exclaimed out loud when Arsenal wasted a chance – that got a few comments from the crowd, but it was good to feel like part of my old club again.

All credit to Luiz – he has so much self-belief. People were saying Mourinho was a genius for letting him go, but was he a genius last night, Calvin?

Of course, he had to let him go for that kind of money. It’s just unfortunate for him that the player came back to demonstrate he was worth every penny. Though I must say, Thiago Silva was magnificent with those successive headers at the other end late on.

You couldn’t have written a better script. David Luiz looks like the hero at his old ground, then Silva gives a horror penalty away but snatches the winning goal.

It’s a valid argument, Jaymie. However, I think Chelsea’s performance has quite a lot to do with winning the Capital One Cup. I’ve never liked that trophy being awarded so early in season. It’s possible you’ll lose focus, making it tough to keep going.

When Chelsea celebrated winning the cup I think they were also enjoying the fact that Manchester City had lost to Liverpool earlier in the day. They were probably thinking they had the league title wrapped up that weekend as well as the League Cup.

That looks to have taken the edge off of them. They had a tough game against West Ham afterwards, and they were very lucky to get a result there. They look to have the wrong mentality.

Money sign? We were talking about the grass! The Old Trafford pitch is part synthetic, part grass, which was a change sanctioned by David Moyes last season.

We were remarking on how it compares to a normal grass pitch. 

I don’t think it makes it any less interesting, Nico, but whether it’s the best? I’m not even sure I thought it was best when Chelsea and Manchester United were in the Champions League final in 2008.

Before Christmas, it looked like Chelsea and Real Madrid could win it. Suddenly there are huge question marks. It’s all about finding consistency and form at right time.

The workload doesn’t help, but Chelsea had seven days to prepare. Routine is everything for footballers, and perhaps going from a game every three days to one a week might have affected them.

Usually Chelsea control the tempo. They tried to press, but the likes of Thiago Motta and Marco Verratti were so calm and technically gifted... this forced the Chelsea players to sit off a bit as they couldn’t get the ball off them.

PSG didn’t panic with ten men, they were brave and kept the ball in tight situations. They just ignored the fact they had 10 men, it was an incredible show of strength. It was like they had been hypnotised into thinking they had 11 men!

Jose Mourinho was just as guilty as his team. Usually he’s very decisive – sending on three subs if he needs to – and gets it spot on. But he had them time wasting after they scored the first goal.

They didn’t go out to win the match.

Ibrahimovic goes to ground, realises he could make heavy contact and tries to pull away - I agree. Oscar knows exactly what he’s doing by feigning injury – it’s not nearly as bad as he makes out.

I don’t think he should have been sent off, I’m not even sure it was a booking. The speed at which the Chelsea players all surround the referee is important – it’s the quickest you’ll ever see John Terry run!

They can’t even be certain what’s happened or if their player is injured, but it doesn’t stop at least five or six of them waving their arms in air. It’s a calculated, orchestrated reaction, and they’ve been doing it for a while.

Premier League the best? It's still interesting, it's about finding consistency

Chelsea look to have the wrong mentality, Capital One Cup win may have taken the edge of them. It shouldn't be handed out so early in the season

@highlight

Both David Luiz and Danny Welbeck were right to celebrate. They were shown the door, so why not?

Manchester United would be near the top of the league under Sir Alex Ferguson. Is Louis van Gaal's man management failing?

'Babies' is a good way to sum Chelsea up... but pressurising the referee certainly works

Did Arsenal underestimate Monaco, and Jose Mourinho the Parisians?
