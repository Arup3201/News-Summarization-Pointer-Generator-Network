Panamanian police named an American ex-Marine as a person of interest on Sunday in the disappearance of a 42-year-old California woman last seen on an archipelago near the Costa Rica border.

Police in Panama and the United States haven't identified Brian Brimager as a suspect as they investigate the case of Yvonne Baldelli, who was reportedly dating Mr Brimager. But Panama national police official Alexis Munoz said Sunday that Mr Brimager had raised investigators' interest.

Panama police said Mr Brimager left Panama for Costa Rica and the United States some 10 days after last being seen with Ms Baldelli in November on the Bocas del Toro islands. Ms Baldelli's family reported her missing in January.

Munoz said witnesses reported the couple had a 'violent' relationship and frequently fought and argued. Panamanian officials said Mr Brimager was between the ages of 35 and 40 and had brought Ms Baldelli to the islands.

Panamanian investigators and FBI 
agents searched a hostel in Panama Friday for blood traces or other 
signs of a California woman last seen there several months ago, an 
official said.

Searches on 
land and by divers off the coast have turned up no sign of Ms Baldelli, 42, of Laguna Niguel, California.

Munoz said that his officers, FBI agents and
forensic specialists were using a chemical that could reveal signs of 
blood on the walls and floor of the hostel El Sapo, in the Bocas del 
Toro archipelago, a popular tourist spot where Ms Baldelli was last seen
on November 26.

Authorities said they were looking for signs that Ms Baldelli may have been a victim of violence in the hotel.

Ms Baldelli and her partner stayed at 
the two-story hostel for about two months. Munoz said Ms Baldelli's family 
had lost any contact with her at the end of November, 'which makes us 
think that there may have been some crime against her.'

Unresponsive: Ms Baldelli's parents last heard from her in November and became concerned when her boyfriend said she ran off to Costa Rica with another man

Together: Mr Brimager has since been named a 'person of interest' in her disappearance

The pair rented an apartment together on the Panamanian island of Carenero and Mr Brimager played guitar in local bars.

Ms Baldelli's parents last heard from her by email in the end of November, but then nothing since.

Mr
Brimager said that she had run away to Costa Rica and taken up with 
another man, but her passport records do not register any travel to the 
neighboring country.

Her 
family became concerned when Mr Brimager stopped answering their calls 
and returned to California in December, shortly after her disappearance.

Her sister Michelle Valenzuela said that she sensed that something bad was going to happen when she sister headed off to Panama, telling CBS that she had an 'ominous' feeling.

Aside from her senses, the first tangible clue they had was when the weekly emails stopped coming.

New beginning? Mr Brimager married a different woman in California, seen here, just months after Yvonne disappeared

Fox News Latino
cites police sources that say the couple had a violent relationship 
during their time in Panama and have suggested that the possibility of a
crime of passion has not been ruled out.

Another unusual move by Mr Brimager 
was to become engaged and marry another woman in the months immediately 
following his girlfriend's disappearance.

Mr Brimager has since taken down his Facebook page, and neither he nor his new wife are responding to press calls.

Since the declaration of him as a formal 'person of interest', the FBI announced that much of their investigation will take place in the U.S. That said, they will also be sending divers down to Panama to search the area around the home where Ms Baldelli and Mr Brimager lived.

Some of her relatives flew to Panama to look for her in January after she did not respond to emails about a planned family reunion.

Local investigations have turned up no solid clues about Ms Baldelli's whereabouts, or the location of her dog named Georgia May.

Her family launched an effort to enlist local volunteers to search via Facebook, and the FBI has since become involved in the case.

'What we want is to bring Yvonne home and show that she's loved and cared about,' her father James Faust said.
