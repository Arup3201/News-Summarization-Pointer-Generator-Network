Samsung is set to ring in the changes with its Galaxy S6 handset and abandon its much criticised practise of filling the handset with unwanted 'bloatware,' it has been claimed.

Samsung's next generation Galaxy handset is set to come in two versions - one with a curved screen that covers both its sides, and be revealed on March 1st.

Now it is claimed the software will also see a radical change.

A Samsung Galaxy Note E, the first to use Samsung's curved screen. It is claimed the Galaxy S6 could come in a special edition with both sides featuring the technology.

Bloatware is the name for any unwanted software or apps that are preinstalled onto phones, tablets, or computers.

As well as taking up space that can be used for photos and other personal files, bloatware can also slow down your device.

Bloatware can also refer to extras that come with wanted software including browser toolbars, desktop widgets or other unwanted additions.

'Software has always been the Achilles heel for Samsung,' said Sammobile, which made the claim.

'There are some really interesting things Samsung is doing if our info is correct, and perhaps the biggest change the S6 will bring is the removal of all pre-installed Samsung apps, or at least that’s how our insider put it.' 

The Korean firm has been heavily criticised in the past for only offering half the storage its customers pay for and although this has been improved with the S5, it is still a problem.

MailOnline revealed that on a 16GB Samsung S5, users get approximately 10GB of space for their own personal files, photos and apps. 

However, the Galaxy S6 will come with apps like Microsoft OneNote, OneDrive, Office Mobile (with a free Office 365 subscription), and Skype, according to Sammobile. 

Both new S6 phones will have all-metal bodies and 5.1inch screens, it has been claimed. 

 'Samsung Electronics Co. plans to release two new versions of its top-tier Galaxy smartphone next month, including a model with a display covering three sides, according to people with direct knowledge of the matter,' Bloomberg said. 

The  'special edition' version will have the curved technology, according to Sammobile.

 The Korean giant believes its curved technology could give it an edge over arch rival Apple. 

The handset is expected to be unveiled at Mobile World Congress, a trade show in Barcelona, which takes place from 2-5 March.

'Today, we can confirm that Samsung is indeed developing a Galaxy S6 with two-edge displays, one on each side, reports our source,' said the Sammobile site. 

The curved screen has already been used  in Samsung's Note Edge. 

In January, Which? magazine tested the eight most popular 16GB handsets from Samsung, Apple, BlackBerry, LG, HTC and Google, pictured. Samsung's Galaxy S4 was the worst performing handset, with only 54% (8.56GB) of available storage, while Apple's iPhone 5C was the best, with 79% (12.6GB)

Previous leaks from BGR say the SM-G925F, the codename believed to be assigned to the Galaxy S6, will feature a Quad HD (2560 x 1440 resolution) 5.5inch display.

It will also have an octa-core processor, Mali-T768 graphics processing unit, and a 16-megapixel rear-facing camera. 

The handset is expected to be unveiled at Mobile World Congress, a trade show in Barcelona, which takes place from 2-5 March. 

However, S6 Edge will have the ability to work in a left or right handed mode

'You will have an option to choose favourite contacts and an ability to assign specific colours to them,' explained Sammobile.

'So, calls and notifications from important people will show the designated color lighting on the edge area.'

Samsung surprised audiences at the Berlin-based trade show IFA in September when it unveiled its curved device. 

The screen was described by Samsung's David Park at the event as working like a 'ticker', with notifications and news scrolling along it.

The Galaxy Note Edge's unique curved touchscreen provides quick access to frequently used apps and alerts.

The curved screen displays notifications at the top and bottom, while viewing a video without disruption, for example.

These images, which appear to have been taken in a toilet, show a rounded edge and antenna bars almost identical to Apple's iPhone 6 in the 'standard' version of the handset

Because the curved edge remains visible even if a flip-book style protective cover is used, it is easier to keep up-to-date with incoming calls and messages. 

Previous leaks from BGR say the SM-G925F — the codename believed to be assigned to the Galaxy S6 — will feature a Quad HD (2560 x 1440 resolution) display, octa-core processor, Mali-T768 graphics processing unit, and a 16-megapixel rear-facing camera.

Earlier this month, in the face of stiff competition, and following a consecutive drop in profits, Samsung announced plans to curb the number of phones it makes each year.

Instead of releasing handset after handset and saturating the market with Samsung devices, the firm has decided it needs to concentrate on making fewer handsets, better. 

 The South Korean manufacturer is also expected to ramp up production of its remaining models so they can be sold more cheaply. 

Apple's On 1 March, Samsung and HTC are separately hosting events in Barcelona, to kick off this year's Mobile World Congress (MWC). HTC is expected to unveil its HTC One M9, while Samsung will likely use its event to announce the Samsung Galaxy S6. Samsung's invite hints at a curved device (pictured) 

Despite a drop in profits, Samsung has retained its leading position in the global smartphone market during the last quarter. 

But, it was the only top five manufacturer to record a sales decline. 

Apple, Xiaomi, Lenovo and LG all posted more than 15 per cent growth in their smartphone shipments, according to market research firm IDC.

Samsung's shipments fell 8 per cent to 78.1 million smartphones in the third quarter, and its market share eroded to 24 per cent from 33 per cent this time last year. 

Samsung's rise to the world's top smartphone maker was helped by its partnership with Google's Android operating system.

But other Android handset makers are matching Samsung in terms of performance, features and design. 

Shares of Samsung Electronics did rise 4 per cent, however, in Seoul. 

Although the earnings were weak, they were better than some forecasts. 

Plus Samsung said it is expecting a strong fourth quarter in the run up to Christmas. 

The strategy was unveiled during a presentation in New York by Samsung's head of investor relations, Robert Yi.

He said the company would reduce the number of smartphone models in 2015 by between a quarter and a third. 

Last month, for the third consecutive quarter, Samsung's profits took a hit.

The smartphone maker reported its lowest quarterly earnings in three years, after profits plummeted by 60 per cent compared to the same time last year.

Compared to a record-high of £6 billion ($9.5 billion) in 2013, the company achieved £2.5 billion ($3.8 billion) profits for July to September.

These figures were in line with what Samsung predicted earlier in October, and the firm blamed the drop on weak sales of its new Galaxy model.

The South Korean electronics giant became the biggest smartphone brand thanks to the popularity of earlier Galaxy models.

But the larger screen on Apple's new iPhone 6 has been linked with luring customers away from the larger Galaxy range. While in China, local brands are making inroads into Samsung's business.

In response to the dramatic drop, Samsung also vowed to revamp its smartphone range to win back customers.

Executives at the South Korean firm said it would overhaul its lower-tier line-up to boost price competitiveness, and use higher-quality components to set its devices apart.

'The mid-to-low end market is growing rapidly, and we plan to respond actively in order to capitalise on that growth,' said Samsung Senior Vice President Kim Hyun-joon during a conference call with analysts.

In a rare acknowledgement, Mr Yi added that Samsung had lagged behind changing market conditions.

Analysts claim the bigger iPhones released last month (shown) will likely take away customers who favoured Samsung Galaxy's larger screens. In emerging markets, such as India and China, Samsung's smartphone sales have been overtaken by local rivals

The company's response 'was not quick enough,' said Mr Yi. 

The earnings were below the median of analysts' expectations of £3 billion ($4.9 billion), according to FactSet, a financial data provider.

The decline in Galaxy sales has also hurt demand for Samsung components such as an advanced display called OLED.

'The operating margin declined due to increased marketing expenditure and lowered average selling price,' Samsung said. 

The company said it 'cautiously expects increased shipments of new smartphones and strong seasonal demand for TV products'. 

The latest profit drop comes despite the launch of the Samsung Galaxy S5 (pictured) earlier this year, which was received by mostly rave reviews. The Galaxy S5 handpicked features from its competitors and put them all into a single handset, with some calling it a 'superphone'

In emerging markets, such as India and China, Samsung's smartphone sales were overtaken by local rivals. 

'Rather than seeking stability, Samsung should seek to distinguish [its phones] with Galaxy's design policies,' Lee Seung-woo, an analyst at IBK Securities said.  

The company moved the launch of the Galaxy Note 4, a large smartphone with a stylus, to late September from October after Apple unveiled the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus. 

It also began sales of the Galaxy Note 4 in China last month, getting an early start in the world's most populous country before Apple.
