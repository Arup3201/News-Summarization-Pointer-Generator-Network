Andrew Bell, 50, told a sixth-form student he was in love with her

A history teacher who told a sixth-form student he was in love with her was sacked for gross misconduct.

Andrew Bell, 50, pursued her for nine months, and sent her unwelcome text messages and emails, a conduct panel heard.

He now faces a teaching ban.

Mr Bell, a history and archaeology teacher, was sacked when bosses at Colchester Sixth Form College, Essex, found out he had repeatedly contacted the girl for nine months.

He appeared before a National College for Teaching & Leadership conduct panel hearing this week and was found guilty of unacceptable professional conduct.

The panel heard Mr Bell had led a school trip to Paris, which the student had attended in March 2012.

After the trip she became distant from him in her lessons and two months later he agreed to her mother's request not to see her on a one-to-one basis.

However, over the coming months he sent five e-mails and texts, including one which said he was in love with her.

Her mother saw one of the texts, which read: '’I’m in Paris again and I’m remembering how much I was in love with you.

'I’m sorry I couldn’t show it then, I wont hassle you anymore but I just wanted to finally tell you what I wanted to say for so long.....x andy’.

Her mother contacted the college, on North Hill, Colchester, and Mr Bell was suspended.

Mr Bell told the hearing the word 'love' had been used informally.

He admitted the facts of the case but denied they amounted to unacceptable professional conduct.

The panel found the most serious text message, sent in March last year, used the words: 'I was in love with you'.

It said: 'In the light of the final text, the preceding contacts can only be seen as unwelcome and crossing a professional boundary.

'The panel were concerned such an experienced teacher failed to follow well understood safeguarding policies when he became concerned about his relationship with the student.'

The panel noted Mr Bell had repeatedly displayed poor professional judgement.

Mr Bell also admitted being absent for one night of another trip to Berlin and allowing students to drink more than was agreed on the Paris trip.

The panel said these were 'isolated errors in judgement' that did not amount to unacceptable professional conduct.

It will announce the sanctions on his conduct, which could include a ban, next week.

Mr Bell was also found guilty of gross misconduct by the college’s disciplinary hearing in May last year.

A spokesman for the college said: 'In the investigatory and disciplinary processes we liaised closely with Essex County Council’s safeguarding and personnel departments.

'We were advised the issues related to professional misconduct and were not criminal behaviour and we were not required to report this matter to the police.

'The recent findings of the National College for Teaching & Leadership are in line with the internal findings.'
