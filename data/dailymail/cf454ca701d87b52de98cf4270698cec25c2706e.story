Catching crooks is too hard, and home security's too soft. But one burglary victim discovered something just right for stopping a thief - his bed.

Baffled Kevin Connolly found a would-be criminal dozing mid-raid in his guest room in Houston, Texas, when he got up to drive to the airport at 4am.

The thief failed to wake up even when the homeowner switched on the light - only rousing himself when arresting officers dragged him from the bed.

Just right! A Goldilocks-like thief was caught fast asleep in the spare bed of a house he was in the middle of stealing from (left). Police arrested a man named as 22-year-old Christopher Provazek (right)

Mr Connolly said he woke up yesterday to find a bag missing along with a string of his possessions missing, including his MacBook Pro, iPad, guitar and even his dog's ashes.

He told local news stations he went downstairs and felt cold air sweeping through the house, so he knew someone must have opened a window. 

He grabbed his gun and searched every room before finding, to his surprise, the placid thief curled up on the sheets. 

Police named the sleeping man as 22-year-old Christopher Provazek, and said dozens of Mr Connolly's possessions were on his porch - along with a half-drunk bottle of liquor.

Victim: Homeowner Kevin Connolly made sure to take a few photos while police were on their way

Mr Connolly told click2houston.com he believed the thief may have made multiple trips before passing out in a booze-fuelled haze.

Provazek reportedly said he'd been framed, to which the homeowner replied the 22-year-old was still wearing his jacket.

Mr Connolly told the news station: 'I said "Hey buddy. Wake up, what are you doing here?" No response. I turned the light on and took a few pictures just for giggles.

'He told me he had been framed for the job and I reminded him that he couldn't have been framed because he was wearing my jacket'.

Provazek was arrested and burglary charges are pending, according to multiple reports.
