A charity raffle organiser who wrote to David Cameron in the hope that the Prime Minister could donate a prize has been left baffled after Downing Street sent back a signed picture.

Dementia campaigner Peter Smith is not sure that anyone who buys a ticket for his Christmas Tea Cosy Dementia Cafe raffle will want an autographed photo of the Prime Minister.

The 65-year-old from Leeds, West Yorkshire, was initially thrilled when Downing Street agreed to help.

Baffled: Peter Smith says that he doesn't know what to do with the signed picture of David Cameron offered by Downing Street as a raffle prize

But rather than send a dinner set or a hamper - the sort of prizes usually on offer as part of the prize draw - he received what he now says will be his 'booby prize'.

Peter, who runs the monthly dementia cafe with his 58-year-old wife Elizabeth, said: 'I was honestly shocked when I opened the package and it was a picture of Mr Cameron.

'The gifts we usually have in our raffles are useful prizes - so for the Christmas raffle we've got a TV, a hamper, a three-piece bistro set, a microwave, a trip to Thorpe Park hotel and spa, which would be a great gift for a carer.

'Alongside that, this picture of David Cameron looks a bit like a joke.

'I cannot think of anyone who would actually want it.'

Peter said the one pound-a-go raffle, which usually attracts around 60 people, aims to help carers and people with dementia, a condition that can affect memory, understanding and speech.

He explained that he wrote to the Prime Minister around six weeks ago inviting Mr Cameron to attend his Christmas raffle.

He received a reply on headed notepaper saying due to commitments, the PM would not be able to attend - but added: 'If you have another raffle, please contact us directly and with reasonable notive we may be able to provide a prize.'

Excited Peter wrote back telling them the next raffle was a special Christmas event on December 1 - and received the signed picture along with a letter that read: 'The Prime Minister is delighted to provide the enclosed signed photograph which comes with his good wishes for your fundraising.'

Peter, who worked in newspaper distribution and with the Alzheimers Society before retiring last year, added: 'I was a bit deflated. I don't know what I was expecting him to send, whether it would be a hamper or whatever, but there seems to be some crossed wires somewhere.

'We make sure all the raffle prizes are something that people who attend the event can use. I think that message might have got a bit lost at Downing Street, so they sent this picture.'So it's a bit of a bizarre prize. I don't really know what to do about it.

'I'd told everyone and they were all really excited to see what Downing Street sent up, so I don't know what they're going to say.

'Usually before the raffle I'll give a bit of a speech and get everyone excited about the prizes we've got on offer, but I honestly don't know what I'm going to say about this.

'I've put it in a frame because it didn't come in one. We're going to have to put our heads together and see what we can make of it.'

Peter, who worked for the Alzheimer's Society following his mother Phyllis' battle with the condition, said: 'I wouldn't buy it. I think it's a bit presumptuous as a raffle prize.'

A Downing Street spokesman said the gift was 'intended as a gesture of good will'.
