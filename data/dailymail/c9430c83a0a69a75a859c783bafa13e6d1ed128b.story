It emerged on Monday that Raheem Sterling could be prepared to turn down as much as £180,000 per week as contract talks with Liverpool continue to stall.

The England international's current £35,000-per-week deal has another two years to run at the end of this season and Sterling has so far turned down a number of offers from the Anfield club.

Sterling has become increasingly concerned by his constant switching of positions in the Liverpool side and has even been utilised at right wing back by Brendan Rodgers.

Here, Sportsmail answers five key questions on the Liverpool star’s future.

Raheem Sterling is prepared to turn down a mammoth £180,000-a-week deal at Liverpool

1) What is Sterling’s issue with the deal on the table?

Brendan Rodgers dug himself a hole by claiming Sterling is the one of the best young players in Europe. Someone of that stature is worth, at least, £100,000-per-week. Your moral views on whether a player so young should be paid so much is irrelevant.

You pay your best players the going rate. Sterling, arguably, is Liverpool's best player meaning he should be, at least, on a par with Daniel Sturridge's £150,000 per week. Likewise, there are issues with Sterling's role in the team at the moment. He's been shifted around the pitch by Rodgers - even utilised as a right wing back on occasions. He sees his best position as being through the middle.

2) What would it take to get him to sign a new deal? 

Certainly an improvement on the £90,000-per-week deal they've offered but even that may not be enough for him to sign. Qualifying for the Champions League will also help matters. A player of Sterling's rising stock wants to be plying his trade on the biggest club stage of all. Playing in the Europa League next season is nowhere near as glamorous. Assurances over his role in the side may help, too.

3) Are Liverpool losing patience with their star man? 

The fans are starting to get a little restless. The longer this drags on, the more agitated supporters become. Fans believe there will be a resolution but that optimism isn't shared by those in the corridors of power at Anfield. They know there's a real danger of Sterling point blank refusing to sign any sort of contract. Liverpool chiefs need to keep negotiations amicable. It's a delicate juggling act for them.

4) What is the likelihood of Sterling leaving Anfield in the summer? 

It remains in Liverpool's hands. The fact of the matter is Sterling will still have two years left on his current £35,000-per-week contract this summer. They could sit tight and maintain he isn't for sale. But whether Liverpool want to risk their prized-asset entering the final year of his contract remains to be seen. Also, will Rodgers want a player who has made it clear he doesn't want to stay? If there is no agreement over a contract, Sterling is likely to leave this summer.

5) If he was to go, what are his options? 

Clubs across the continent will be clambering for his signature should Liverpool decide to sell. Bayern Munich and Real Madrid are both monitoring the situation carefully. Likewise, Manchester City will be hugely interested in the forward. Arsenal are also keeping tabs on Sterling's situation but the greater finances of their rivals mean they are likely to be outsiders.
