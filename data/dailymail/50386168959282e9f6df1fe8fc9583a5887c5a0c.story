Looking at these photos, they could easily be from a film reel salvaged from 60 years ago.

But these images were actually taken this weekend at holiday camp in Norfolk during the Hemsby Rock 'n' Roll Weekender.

Devotees of the 1950s' revival packed their vintage clothes into their Cadillacs and descended on the Seacroft Holiday Camp for the biannual event.Â 

Twice a year, fans of rock 'n' roll, 
rockabilly, rockin' blues of the 1950s and Americana gather at the 
sleepy resort of Hemsby to dress up in period clothing and re-live the 
era over four days.

Bands play music of the era and devotees hit the dance floor to hop, bop, jive and rock 'n' roll.

The event has been running since 1988 - making this Hemsby Rock 'n' Roll Weekender the festival's 50th.

Rockabilly, which emerged from the Southern United States in the early 1950s, is thought to be one of the earliest styles of rock and roll music.

The term came from rock 'n' roll and hillbilly, the latter being a reference to the country music that contributed strongly to the style's development.

The popularity of the style waned in the 1960s but it is thought to have enjoyed a major revival in the late 1970s and early 1980s that has lasted to the present day, often within a rockabilly subculture.
