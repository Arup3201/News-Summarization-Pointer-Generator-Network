A three-story, professionally built treehouse is impressive even without a cool backstory. But the story of how one came to be at a summer camp in Wisconsin is as heartwarming as it is impressive.

Camp Wandawega is about two hours outside of Chicago and was the childhood getaway of David Hernandez.

In 2004, Hernandez and wife Tereasa Surratt bought the property, which previously Latvian Church Camp.

Fancy: Tereasa Surratt turned a sick tree into a touching memorial to hear father

Touching: Surratt's father hung a rope swing on an elm tree on the camp his daughter bought to christen the previously Christian summer camp

Surratt's father died shortly after she bought the camp - then the tree where he'd hung the swing fell ill

When the couple bought the property, Surratt's father was ill, but he christened his daughter's new camp by installing a rope swing on a giant Elm tree in the middle of the camp.

Sadly, Surratt's father died 18 months later. Then the young couple got some more bad news.

'Almost immediately after, we found out the tree had Dutch elm disease,' 
Surratt tells Chicagomag.com. 'I was devastated. I couldn’t cut that tree down.'

Luckily, the trunk of the tree was still strong even as the branches began dying. In an effort to keep the tree - and preserve the memory of Surratt's father - they decided to someday build a treehouse around the remaining trunk.

The couple went about cleaning up the rest of the camp, and put the treehouse plan on the back-burner for a while.

Not your average tree house: To preserve the tree - and the swing - Surratt decided to turn build a tree house

One day, Surratt and friend  Angela Finney-Hoffman were talking about the camp and talked about turning it into an art camp for adults. They also talked about building the treehouse - and decided it was time to make it happen.

Surratt recruited Shaun Owens-Agase and Tyler Peterson to help build it.

'Of course they chose a big healthy tree with a gorgeous green canopy,' Surratt told the magazine.. 

Surratt, however, had other plans, and when she told the designers the story of her father's elm, they agreed that was the tree for the treehouse.

The designers wanted to go a bit bigger than Surratt initially had planned, but that was fine with her.

'Everyone had a radically different idea, and everyone was thinking 100
 times bigger and more elaborate than I was,' she says. 'I was 
imagining a little kid’s house. The things they were coming up with were
 like castles in the sky.'

Go big or go home: Designers Shaun Owens-Agase and Tyler Peterson had big plans for the treehouse

The impressive abode is three stories high and includes a wood-burning stove and an upstairs bedroom - and, of course, a swing

The design they went with was a three-level cottage that has more bells and whistles than your average treehouse.

Of course, Surratt's father's swing remained on the tree - and she is grateful for the help she received.

'It’s rare to find folks so selfless that they would literally build you a cabin in the sky and ask for nothing in return,' she says. 'And these folks aren’t your average builders, but amazing, visionary designers. It’s humbling beyond words.'
