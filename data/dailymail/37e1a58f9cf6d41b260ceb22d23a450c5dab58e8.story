At first glimpse these pictures may look like nothing out of the ordinary - appearing to just show an ordinary leaf or a branch of a tree.

But on closer inspection you can spot some of nature's true masters of disguise playing a killer game of hide and seek.

From a katydid disguised as a leaf to a tiny Pygmy Seahorse camouflaged in sea fan in Papua New Guinea, these images showcase the creatures who can quite literally blend into the background.

The talented animals have the ability to camouflage themselves within their environment to hide from predators as a means of survival in the natural world.

The creatures photographed in this series of images use two basic methods of concealment in a bid to hide from predators and catch prey.

Some animals, such as the flat fish, use their colour to blend into a background making them barely visible.

Whereas others, such as the Katydid, cleverly mimic their surroundings using their shape, colour and texture to become part of the landscape.

Photographer John Cancalosi who captured these images of camouflage animals said the animals used their talent to remain hidden from predators.

Keeping a keen eye: John Cancalosi, who took this snap of a tiny red crab camouflaged on a Sea Fan in Papua New Guinea, said even he sometimes struggles to spot the creatures he photographs

He said some had mastered the art of invisible so well it was a challenge for him to even spot them.

He said: 'Katydids look so much like leaves in their colour, detail and texture, it actually looks like the leaves are copying the katydids.

'They are so used to pretending to be leaves they have the ability to remain completely still.

'There are also caterpillars who are such good leaf mimics when the wind blows they'll move themselves so as to appear like dead leaves blowing in the wind. It really is quite amazing to witness.'
