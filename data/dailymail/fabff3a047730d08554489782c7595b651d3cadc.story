It’s very rare to look at a professional photograph these days and not assume it’s been digitally altered.

But one artist is bucking the digital trend – refusing to use Photoshop and taking his photographs with analogue cameras.

Ukrainian photographer Oleg Oprisco’s photographs are born out of his imagination and bringing them to life takes more hard work than the average photo shoot.

Roll it up: One model rolls up what appears to be pre-grown grass and slings it under her arm, while another lays down a piece of fabric, while holding a vintage sewing machine

Flower children: A model is photographed with a bouquet of flowers on her head, while butterflies fly out of the other model's book

Oleg commenced his career at 16-years-old, where he would play around in his spare time while working at a photo lab.

Speaking with photography blog I Still Shoot Film, he admitted that the challenge of shooting on film is what excites him.

‘I see film photography as a game in a casino. You can win big or lose it all. I press the shutter release button and then I have to wait to find out the results when the film is processed,’ he said.

‘It’s a very cool feeling, addictive like a drug.’

Windows into the soul: One model is perched atop a crumbling shack, with the other standing next to a tree covered in intricate bird feeders

The sea, the sea: Both models are photographed near the ocean, birds circle above one and the other holds just one red balloon

Fielding out a landscape: Both models stand in a field - one appears to be painting the grass green, while the other appears to be burning the crop to the ground

Captured using Kiev 6C and Kiev 88 medium format cameras, Oleg uses a variety of lenses to get the effect he desires.

With twelve shots captured to each roll of film, he’s also unable to review the captured photographs until the film is developed.

While the photographs are not created using Photoshop, he does admit to using them to digitally modify the images.

Not to create the sets or resize the props, merely to correct the colouring in the final images and remove specks of dust from the frame.

Deciding what he will shoot isn’t even the struggle, as it is for so many artists.

Preparing the shoot doesn’t involve a keyboard and mouse, but a notepad and pen.

Painting the town red: Red features prominently in both photographs - where one has flaming red hair hanging to the side of her cape, the other appears to be painting the leaves red

Shine a light on me: One model is walking out of a tunnel with a fire ball in her hand, while a male model struggles to kiss what appears to be his lover - her body shrouded in sheer material

Taking a trip: The model on the left rides through the sky, while the one on the right sits perched on top of a stack of oversized vintage luggage

The props themselves would often take days to create – with the photos featured containing fake butterflies of varying sizes, oversized matchsticks, a stack of fake books, up to 21 light wooden bird feeders and pile of oversized vintage-style luggage.

On top of that, there’s hair, costumes and makeup to take into consideration.

Oleg Oprisco is based in Ukraine.
