A morbidly obese dog that snacked on pastries, roast dinners and cups of tea has lost almost half her body weight after embarking on a diet.

Amber, a beagle, ballooned to a whopping five stones after she refused to eat dog food and left her owner with no choice but to feed her human snacks.

The spoilt pet was fed salmon, chicken, roast dinners, toast, and sugary treats by her well-meaning family and grew so large she couldn't be taken out for walks.

Her owner Sharon Lowrie, from Bishop Auckland, County Durham, didn't realise her beloved pooch's health was in danger until she was deemed too unhealthy for an operation on her rear right leg.

Since then, Amber has undergone a special dog diet to save her life and has lost a staggering 2st 7lbs and is now a normal size for her age and breed.

Mrs Lowrie, a 49-year-old solicitor, bought Amber as a puppy and she grew at a healthy rate until she was spayed at 18 months when she started getting fussy over her food.

She said: 'She wouldn't eat any dog food and would act like a spoilt child, barking until she was fed what she wanted, which was human food.

'After a while of trying to get her to eat dog food I thought I had to feed her something, so she would have salmon, chicken, and ham.

'Because I work full-time, when she was a puppy I would take her to my aunt's house but as people came in for tea and a cake throughout the day, Amber would get some too.

'She would have a Danish pastry and a cup of tea in her bowl there, and when she got home she would bark and grizzle until you gave her tidbits of our tea.'

A year ago Amber was sedated so she could have her claws clipped but seemed to struggle with waking up and couldn't support her own weight.

Vets told Mrs Lowrie that Amber had snapped a crucial ligament in her leg and needed an operation, which could only be done if she lost weight.

The vets started feeding the huge dog Royal Canin Obesity Management food, and instructed Mrs Lowrie to continue until Amber reached a healthy weight of 2st 9lbs.

Hungry: Amber as a puppy, when she clearly already had a healthy appetite

Mrs Lowrie, a married mother-of-two, said: 'I didn't believe she was as overweight as she was and I wouldn't accept she was morbidly obese, even though my husband said we needed to do something about it.

'She was lame in one of her legs and vets said because her quality of life was so low the best thing to do would be to put her to sleep, but I was in pieces.

'We found out she had torn a ligament in her leg and needed an operation, but they wouldn't operate until she had lost weight.

'Over the next year we did a Royal Canin diet which is just dry dog food, and she initially turned her nose up at it but then realised that was all she was going to get.'

Amber reached her target last month by eating a bowl of the dry dog food mixture twice a day.

She no longer needs to have an operation as the damaged ligament has healed, although she does take pain relief medication.

Gabrielle Taylor, head veterinary nurse at Wilson Veterinary Group, said: 'Amber was one of the largest dogs I had ever seen.

'She had a ruptured cruciate ligament and wasn't able to walk unassisted or able to support herself and it was too unsafe to operate. But she has now lost a lot of weight by diet and exercise.

'The message here is for people to speak to their vet, they are not there to judge you and if it has got out of hand they shouldn't be embarrassed.'
