A young woman's body was discovered this morning lying near a creek behind her apartment complex.

Police told Daily Mail Australia that the body was discovered near Bridge Road in the western Sydney suburb of Westmead at 7.30am.

The body was found by the woman's husband and brother who called emergency services.

They were led from the scene screaming: 'Please, please, let me see her face,' Macquarie Radio reported.

A woman has drowned in Westmead Sydney. The circumstances of her death are yet to be determined

Police are reviewing CCTV footage of the woman, which shows her walking to and from the back entrance of her Westmead unit four or five times on Tuesday evening.

'She looked as if she was waiting for someone,' said complex manager Tom Hailey.

Mr Hailey said the woman lived in a leased unit on the seventh floor of the apartment block.

'She looked as if she was waiting for someone,' Mr Hailey said.

After some time the woman wedged her scarf in the door to keep it ajar and left, he said.

Police have said that they are treating her death as suspicious as it is not clear whether she drowned or died in another way.

A resident at the Monarco Estate complex said no one ever went to the creek behind the block.'It's not a place where people walk through, it's not pleasant, it's dirty and the weather's been bad,' she said.

The death has shocked locals, especially a resident who was from the same level where the woman lived.

A crime scene has been set up where the body was found.

Details of the woman's identity have not been released.
