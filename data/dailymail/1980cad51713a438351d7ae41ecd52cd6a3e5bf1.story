Tragic: Joshua Stadius-Horn died after accidentally hanging himself while playing in his bedroom with his three younger brothers, an inquest heard

A nine-year-old boy has died after accidentally hanging himself while playing in his bedroom with his three younger brothers.

Joshua Stadius-Horn had been spending time with his siblings at home in Watton, Norfolk, when he became tangled in the cord of his dressing gown.

He was found by his mother Helen and airlifted to hospital, but sadly died a few hours later.

The accident happened at about 8am on New Year's Day after the boys had been sent upstairs to tidy their bedroom,  an inquest in Norfolk heard yesterday.

Mrs Stadius-Horn realised that Joshua was in trouble when one of his younger brothers ran into her bedroom - complaining that the schoolboy 'wasn't helping' to tidy up and was 'pretending to be dead'.

She then discovered her unconscious son, before calling 999 and starting to perform CPR.

Paramedics and police arrived at the house, and Joshua was flown by air ambulance helicopter to Addenbrookeâ€™s 
Hospital in Cambridge. 

However, he died later that night, with his mother and father Steve, at his bedside after his life support machine was turned off.

Yesterday, police officer Donna Flanaghan told the inquest that social services had had no concerns about the schoolboy.

And recording a verdict of accidental death, coroner Jacqueline Lake agreed there had been no suspicious circumstances.

She added Joshua had died from a 'catastrophic' brain injury.

'It was a tragic accident in which Joshua was not aware and died not knowing the outcome of his actions,' she said.

Speaking after the inquest, Mrs Stadius-Horn paid tribute to her 'amazing' son.

'Josh was an amazing son and brother and we are all devastated by such a tragic accident,' she said.

'We love him so much and he will be very much missed.'
