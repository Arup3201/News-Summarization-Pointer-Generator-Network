Shocking footage has been posted on the Dash Cam Owners Australia Facebook page of another road rage incident in Queensland. 

The driver, only known as Stephen T, was driving the 445 km journey between Gladstone to Mackay when he came across one driver who didn't take too kindly to being overtaken.

Stephen T was in a 4-Wheel-Drive going along a 100 kmh road when he came up behind a driver in a red Suzuki SUV which was only driving at 80 kmh.

The shocking footage was posted on the Dash Cam Owners Australia Facebook

The driver ahead is seen erratically tapping the breaks of his car for no apparent reason

The SUV driver can be seen continually tapping his breaks for 15 minutes of the journey before the car with the dash cam actually runs into the car in front. 

Stephen T posted on Facebook: 'Driving from Gladstone to Mackay just north of Serina came cruising up behind this bloke not thinking much of his speed just getting as close as you safely can to try and overtake and not tailgate.'

The footage starts off on a rural tree-lined road where the dash cam driver is a safe distance away going about 100kmh. 

The SUV driver can be seen breaking for no apparent reason in the footage with no traffic ahead.

The driver ahead slows right down and the two vehicles nearly collide on the rural section of the road. 

When the two cars crash the SUV driver gets out and starts strolling towards the dash cam driver

The footage then cuts ahead 15 minutes and they are in a more built up area, the SUV can then be seen aggressively pulling in front of the dash cam driver where they again nearly collide. 

The dash cam driver goes into the SUV driver further down that stretch of road.  

The dash cam driver can be heard saying on the footage 'You’re a f***ing psycho' before the SUV driver jumps out of his car and strolls towards the car. 

He repeats the insult and a punch sound is then heard, the dash cam driver says 'You are in deep trouble mate'  

 The drivers then trade heated words for 30 seconds before the SUV drivers leaves the scene. 

The video has been shared nearly 2000 times and has more than 5000 likes.
