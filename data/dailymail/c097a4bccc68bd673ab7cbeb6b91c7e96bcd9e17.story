Pablo Zabaleta proved he's made of stern stuff after playing on in Manchester City's 2-2 draw at home to Burnley, despite suffering a gruesome-looking injury.

The full back took a nasty blow to the face after an accidental clash of heads with team-mate Eliaquim Mangala - as the duo challenged for an aerial ball in the first half.

Images, not for the faint-hearted, show the City medical team applying three stitches to the Argentine full-back, who was cut above his left eye.

The 29-year-old played the remainder of the game with a bandage wrapped around his head.

Despite his injury, Zabaleta won't be the only City player with a sore head after they threw away the chance to close the gap to one point on league leaders Chelsea.

The hosts took a two-goal lead at the Etihad Stadium courtesy of David Silva and Fernandinho before George Boyd and Ashley Barnes replied for the Clarets after the interval.

City boss Manuel Pellegrini accused his players of complacency after the match and will be demanding his side produce a better display when they host Sunderland on New Years Day.

The full back soon returned to the action as City were held to a frustrating 2-2 draw at home to Burnley
