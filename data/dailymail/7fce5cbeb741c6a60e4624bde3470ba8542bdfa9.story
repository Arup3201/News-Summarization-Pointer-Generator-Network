Anderson Cooper has tweeted his amazement at hearing his late father's voice for the first time in more than 30 years after a recording of a 1970s radio show was posted online.

Wyatt Cooper was an author, actor and screenwriter who suffered a heart attack while undergoing open-heart surgery and died on January 5, 1978, at the age of 50.

After hearing the recording of his father’s voice on Tuesday, Cooper tweeted: ‘Extraordinary. This is the first time I am hearing my father’s voice since I was ten years old.’

The death of his father while he was still a boy is a tragedy that Cooper says has been a major influence on how he has lived his life. 

He considers his father's book 
Families to be ‘sort of a guide on...how he would have wanted me to live
 my life and the choices he would have wanted me to make. And so I feel 
very connected to him.’

Cooper was born on June 3, 1967, in New York City, the younger son of Wyatt Cooper and heiress and New York socialite Gloria Vanderbilt.

Tragedy would strike the Cooper family again in 1988, when his brother, Carter, committed suicide by jumping to his death from the 14th-floor window of their mother's New York City apartment.

Just as his father's death had, Carter's death fueled Cooper's drive, and he would later connect the event with his correspondent career: 'I became interested in questions of survival: why some people survive and others don't ... Covering wars just seemed logical.'

The recording features Wyatt Cooper reading a chapter of ‘Miss MacIntosh My Darling’ by Marguerite Young.

It has been 
restored and resurrected by New York art organization The Clocktower 
Gallery and features on ARTonAIR, an online cultural audio archive.

The recording was originally carried out in either 1976 or 1977 for a series of WBAI radio programs focused on literature and radio performance, called The Reading Experiment.

As part of the series, 'Miss MacIntosh, My Darling' was read over a year-long period by Marguerite Young’s contemporaries from the New York City literature, music, and theater communities. All readings are underscored with soundscapes and music by artist Rob Wynne.
