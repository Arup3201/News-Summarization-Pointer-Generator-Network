Liverpool striker Daniel Sturridge will not make his return to action in Tuesday's Capital One Cup semi-final against Chelsea.

The striker, who has been out injured for nearly five months with thigh and calf problems, travelled with the rest of the Reds squad to London after returning to first-team training this month.

But despite posting a photo to Instagram which suggested otherwise, Sturridge was not deemed fit enough for a place on Liverpool's bench.

Posting a picture of his legs and some camouflage trainers, the 25-year-old added the caption 'Game time... #hardwork'. 

Brendan Rodgers has confirmed that Sturridge will definitely see some action against West Ham on Saturday but the Liverpool boss would not reveal whether the ex-Chelsea man would be fit to face his former club.

The tie is in the balance after last week's game at Anfield, which saw Raheem Sterling secure a 1-1 draw for the hosts after Eden Hazard's goal from the penalty spot.

Speaking about Sturridge on Monday, Rodgers said: 'We will see how Daniel is today. He trained very well with the team yesterday and it is as confident as he has looked.

'We won't risk him, that is for sure. We need to make sure he is ready and feels ready. He won't be 100 per cent when he comes back.

'He will need game time, but all we can do is make sure he is in the best condition he can be physically and mentally.'
