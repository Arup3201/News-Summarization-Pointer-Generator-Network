The medical director of the post-deployment clinic at the scandal-plagued Veterans Affairs hospital in Phoenix, Arizona, says that injured combat veterans from conflicts in both Iraq and Afghanistan have been forced to wait months to be seen by healthcare professionals despite the fact that there is a national directive that requires they be given priority access to medical treatment at VA hospitals.

Dr. Katherine Mitchell says that up until about three weeks ago - when the problems at the Phoenix VA began to come to light - didn't honor the national mandate giving priority scheduling for medical treatment for injured vets.

According to Mitchell, injured vets sometimes had to wait months to be seen.

Whistleblower: Dr. Katherine Mitchell says she witnessed dishonest scheduling practices at the Phoenix Veterans Affairs hospital

'People that are 100 percent service 
connected that are polytrauma were waiting anywhere from six to 10 
months to get into a new appointment when I found out about 'em,' she 
said during an interview on CNN's AC 360.

Recent 
revelations blame shoddy management for the deaths of dozens of former 
soldiers, airmen, sailors and Marines, as administrators in Phoenix – 
and possibly elsewhere – maintained a secret off-the-books waiting list 
for veterans in need of critical care.

Official
 lists were kept short so the agency could appear to be doing its job 
despite some waits being more than a year long.

In one case, a Phoenix 
official was awarded bonuses based on fraudulent statistics as veterans 
died waiting for medical care.

'We
 have been working continuously to try and identify where those sites 
are and what we need to do to prevent that from happening. It's 
absolutely inexcusable,' Veterans Affairs Undersecretary Robert Petzel told lawmakers last week.

'The individuals are ... held accountable,' he insisted, while admitting that  'I can't give you an example specifically.'

'But if someone were found to be manipulating inappropriately the scheduling system, they would be disciplined.'

Veterans Affairs Secretary 
Eric Shinseki requested and received Petzel's resignation but has 
steadfastly insisted upon staying put himself, despite calls from 
prominent Republicans and Democrats for his ouster.

White
 House Press Secretary Jay Carney released an approving statement about Petzl's resignation, which was announced just an hour
 after his final daily press briefing of the week concluded.

'The
 president supports Secretary Shinseki’s decision,' Carney said, adding 
that President Obama 'has asked Secretary Shinseki to conduct a review 
of Veterans Health Administration practices and procedures at its 
facilities nationwide to ensure better access to care, and that review 
is ongoing.'

Veterans Affairs Undersecretary for Health Dr. Robert Petzel has resigned just a day after testifying in a contentious Senate hearing about a VA health care scandal tied to as many as 40 deaths

'The president and Secretary Shinseki take the allegations around misconduct very seriously,' he added.

Shinseki
 said in a statement that 'most veterans are satisfied with the quality 
of their VA health care, but we must do more to improve timely access to
 that care.'

Mitchell
 told CNN that there were instances at the Phoenix clinic that case 
managers and patient advocates told superiors, 'This guy can't wait. Can
 you see him?'

'We're talking about people that 
were injured by being blown up by IEDs. We're talking about people who 
had a mental breakdown and have severe PTSD and ...are having trouble 
functioning,' she said.

Mitchell says she reported the issues to the VA's Office of the Inspector General.

The
 doctor believes the problem at the VA is a lack of medical 
professionals to care for the large number of veterans their supposed to
 care for. She says this is the result of low pay, slow hiring practices
 and not enough qualified professionals applying to work at the VA.

'As a result, you've got a lot of 
patients and not enough providers,' she said. 'It's not just Phoenix VA.
 It's across the country, which is why everyone is hiding a backlog.'

On
 Wednesday, the House of Representatives approved a bill to give the 
Veterans Affairs secretary more authority to fire or demote senior 
executives at the agency.

The
 bill is in direct response to the growing furor over allegations of 
treatment delays and preventable deaths at VA hospitals.

According
 to the department's inspector general, 26 facilities are being 
investigated nationwide, including the Phoenix hospital, which is facing
 allegations that 40 people died while waiting for treatment.

Standing guard: Members of the American Legion have attended hearings and applied pressure throughout the VA scandal, demanding Shinseki's resignation at every turn

Republican
 Rep. Jeff Miller of Florida said VA officials who have presided over 
mismanagement or negligence are more likely to receive bonuses or 
glowing performance reviews than any sort of punishment.

The bill was approved Wednesday, and now goes to the Senate.

The
 White House says it supports the goal of seeking greater accountability
 at the VA but has unspecified concerns about the legislation.

President Obama has vowed to hold anyone who falsified records at VA hospitals accountable. He also said that he is sending his deputy chief of staff, Rob Nabors, 
to Phoenix on Wednesday to visit the facility.

Mitchell
 says she didn't personally have any patients die as a result of the 
dishonest scheduling practices, but she says she was aware of a trend of
 suicides amongst combat vets.

'These guys who committed suicide, who 
were successful suicide completions, would have benefited from more 
intense mental health treatment,' she said. 'And those appointments 
weren't available.'
