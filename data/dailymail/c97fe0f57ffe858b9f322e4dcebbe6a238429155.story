Sir Paul McCartney's ex-wife Heather Mills has sold her British beachfront home for £2.75 million ($4.47m) to superstar DJ Fatboy Slim and his wife, DJ Zoe Ball - as she continues to spend most of her time in Austria.

The 44-year-old blonde, who is training to win a spot on the GB Paralympic team for the 2014 Winter games in Sochi, Russia, sold the stunning property to the DJ, real name Norman Cook, and his wife - who already own a property on the same row in Hove, East Sussex.

The celebrity enclave boasts a string of celebrity residents, including singer Adele and British comedian David Walliams.

Austria-bound: Heather Mills now divides her time between the UK and Austria, where she trains for the Winter 2014 Paralympic Games

Heather, who had her left leg amputated below the knee after a collision with a police motorbike in 1993, is keen to compete in the Winter 2014 games - and has already splashed out on two properties in Austria.

She bought a £1.5 million ($2.4m) two-bedroom apartment inside the grounds of the five-star, 400-year-old Schlosshotel Velden, a former royal palace, in May this year.

And she already owns a £1.4 million ($2.3m) chalet near Goldeck am Millstätter See, in the Austrian Alps, which she uses as her base for her training.

The mother-of-one - who has a nine-year-old daughter Beatrice with Sir Paul, 70 - put her eight-bedroom home stately country estate in the historic village of Robertsbridge in East Sussex up for sale for £3.9 ($6.3m) million last year.

However, she changed her mind and later withdrew it from the market.

Heather has shared custody of her daughter with Sir Paul, and Beatrice's base is in the UK, where she goes to school.

Sir Paul now spends much of his time in New York with his third wife, Nancy Shevell.

And a source said: 'Paul and Heather have total split custody of Beatrice. Paul will spend a week in the US and then come home to see Beatrice and then fly back again. Her home is in the UK.

'Heather does the same, she splits her time now between Austria and the UK.'

Heather built up an impressive property porfolio following her bitter divorce from Sir Paul in 2008.

But she has been off-loading her homes and last year sold a condominium in the West Village, Manhattan, for $5 million, as well as an apartment on The Bishops Avenue, Hampstead, North London, for £3.75million ($6.1m).

Following the end of her tumultous marriage to Beatles legend Sir Paul, Heather was awarded a £24.3 million ($39.5m) settlement, and has used this money to enlist the help of numerous former skiers, including the previous world speed record holder John Clark.

She had a trial with the British disability skiing team in December 2010 and she officially joined the 19-strong development squad last year.

But despite her speed, Heather's progress was hampered by difficulties with her prosthetic leg, which frequently "ejected" her from her skis - and has suffered a string of accidents.

In May 2011 she had to be airlifted to hospital  after colliding with a pole during training and fracturing her shoulder.

Then, just six months later, she injured her partly amputated left leg and broke her thumb.

She told BBC Sport last month: 'I was a little bit concerned because when I went into it [training], the leg kept coming off, but now the London Prosthetics Centre has helped design a new one.

'It means it cuts the circulation off for two minutes from the start to the finish of the course before I release it. But it actually stays on so, fingers crossed, no more injuries!'

She claimed the Super-G Austria Cup title in the speed race nine months ago. And Four gold medals  followed in April at the US Adaptive Alpine Skiing National Championships in Aspen, Colorado.

The improvements will have to continue throughout the next 16 months if she wants to win a place at the the Paralympics in March 2014.

Heather will have to achieve a International Paralympic Committee Alpine Ski  [IPCAS] score of 80 points and British coaches have now insistead that she work on her technique and enter additional slalom races in a bid to improve her chances.

She said: 'It's going to put my injury risk up even more. I'm going to try it and then hopefully convince them otherwise to say 'Do you want some medals in speed, or absolutely zilch at Sochi?' so we'll see.'

In May, Heather told Hello! magazine her young daughter told her: 'I';ve got the hottest mummy in school', thanks to her improved physique, adding: "She is really proud of me, and so lovely and sweet. To get the confidence about how you look from your daughter is heart-warming.'

She declared: “My goal is to get to Russia and to win a medal. The older you get, the more you realise that if you hang on in there, you can get past virtually anything.

I’m not afraid of anything. You can’t feel fear if you’re going to be a good downhill skier,” she adds. “And I’ve been skiing at 120km an hour!'
