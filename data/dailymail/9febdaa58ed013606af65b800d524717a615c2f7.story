It was a music hall favourite which has since become instantly synonymous with wartime Britain.

But while the popularity of 'It's A Long Way To Tipperary' has never been in doubt, two towns are fighting over the exact origin of the First World War classic.

A row has erupted between Oldbury, in the West Midlands, and Manchester suburb Stalybridge after both claimed the iconic tune was written on their patch.

Iconic: It's A Long Way To Tipperary is well-known and loved as a wartime classic

Both places are planning civic events to mark the 100th anniversary of the inspiring song, but they cannot agree on where its author penned the famous tune.

Jack Judge, the song's writer, was a fishmonger who hailed from Oldbury, but it is accepted that he first performed it on Jan 31 1912 at Stalybridge's Grand Theatre.

A brass band will belt out the classic in Stalybridge centre, while Oldbury Library will be the venue for a community choir’s rendition of the song.

Historians in Stalybridge are adamant he penned his classic during an extended stint at the theatre, after a fellow artiste wagered five shillings he couldn’t write a winning tune in less than a day.

Alan Rose of Stalybridge Local History Society, said in the 1920s, Jack Judge wrote a letter to the Stalybridge Year Book confirming he wrote it while staying at the town’s Newmarket Tavern.

A plaque to that effect has since been placed on the pub wall.

Yet their Oldbury counterparts insist Jack, born in 1872, wrote the tune - originally entitled It’s A Long Way To Connermara - at home, before taking it on the road when his music hall career took off.

Mr Rose said: 'Oldbury is claiming it because he was a resident there, but there is no doubt he wrote it in Stalybridge. There is no doubt in my mind.

'He got himself into a bet with another artiste. He bet five shillings Jack couldn’t write a song in 24 hours, which he did.'

That’s news to Oldbury residents who believe Jack crafted his greatest hit on the piano of a local pub.

Dr Terry Daniels, head of Oldbury Local History Society, believes Jack ‘pulled a fast one’. He already had the tune in his pocket when he agreed the bet.

'He was always a betting man and he would steer a conversation to writing songs,' he said.

'There is no doubt he sang It’s A Long Way To Tipperary for the first time in Stalybridge - no one in Olbury disagrees with that. But it was not produced from a blank piece of paper.'
