A politician who is frontrunner in the race to become the next New York mayor will marry her long-term girlfriend next month after spending years fighting to legalise same-sex marriage.

Christine Quinn, speaker of New York City Council, is set to become one of the most prominent  officials to have a gay wedding after it became legal to wed on July 24 last year.

Miss Quinn, 46, will marry girlfriend Kim Catullo on May 19 in Manhattan before 300 guests including New York's Mayor Bloomberg, Governor Andrew Cuomo and senators for the state Kirsten Gilliband and Charles Schumer.

A former chief judge Judith Kaye will officiate over the ceremony at a venue close to the High Line park in the trendy Meatpacking District.

It is expected that Miss Quinn, the first gay person in charge of the city council, will run for the position of New York mayor next year.

However she told the New York Times that the couple's big day was not about politics but a private time for her and Miss Catullo, a 45-year-old lawyer. 

She said: 'There’s really not a political implication to this for me as it relates to electoral politics. We’re trying to make it really a day, a night that’s about friends and family and us.'

Favourite: Recent polls have placed Miss Quinn as the most popular Democratic candidate to become the next New York mayor

The couple met in 2001 when they were set up by mutual friends.

Miss Quinn has long been an impassioned support of gay marriage. In 2009, she urged the state Senate to pass the same-sex marriage bill so 'all New York families are equal'.

When the bill was legalised last July, she spoke of her happiness for same-sex couples in New York along with her own wedding plans.

In a poll this week, Miss Quinn was 
the runaway Democratic favourite to stand in the 2013 mayoral elections 
in a battle which could pit her against the Republican frontrunner and 
current Police Commissioner Ray Kelly.

According to the latest NY1/Marist 
College poll, Miss Quinn holds 32 per cent of the vote and is 20 points 
clear of her nearest challenger, former city comptroller Bill Thompson.

If she was elected, Miss Quinn would become the first woman and openly gay person to run New York.
