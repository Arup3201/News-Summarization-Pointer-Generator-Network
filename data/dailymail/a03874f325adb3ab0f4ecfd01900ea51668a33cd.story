Christmas is now only five weeks away, and four Premier League footballers got into the festive spirit when they attended the Dolce & Gabbana Christmas Tree Party at Claridge's.

Chelsea duo Oscar and Willian, as well as Arsenal midfielder Mathieu Flamini and QPR's Adel Taarabt, were among a star-studded line-up of guests at the central London hotel.

The night was primarily to celebrate the Claridge's tree, designed for the second year in a row by Domenico Dolce and Stefano Gabbana, who were both in attendance.

The tree has been decorated with 300 hand-painted glass baubles - each featuring international flags to symbolise other seasonal traditions.

And there were plenty of nationalities on show in the footballing contingency present.

Chelsea stars Oscar and Willian both represent the best of Brazil, while Flamini is French and Taarabt Moroccan.

They will all be sampling the delights of a British Christmas this year though, as they travel around the UK for a busy footballing schedule over the coming weeks.

Also on show at the bash were singers, actors and actresses and fashion designers.

Pixie Lott made an appearance with her boyfriend Oliver Cheshire, while pop sensation Kylie Minogue and Harry Potter actor Tom Felton were also in attendance.
