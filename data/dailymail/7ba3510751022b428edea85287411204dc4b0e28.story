Alan Pardew was celebrating the perfect Selhurst Park homecoming last night - and then revealed that the first person to congratulate him after Crystal Palace’s 2-1 win over Spurs was Mike Ashley.

Pardew walked out on Newcastle just days before returning to Palace so was delighted to pick up Ashley’s message minutes after the final whistle.

‘When I checked my phone after the game the first person who texted me was Mike Ashley and I appreciated that,’ he added. ‘He knew that probably it was the right time for everybody concerned.

Mike Ashley was the first person to congratulate him after the win, according to Pardew

‘He just said it was a great result and I appreciated that.’

Pardew soaked up the applause from a thrilled home crowd who had seen Palace bounce back from a Harry Kane opener to win courtsy of a Dwight Gayle penalty and Jason Puncheon.

But Pardew reckoned the masterstroke was the half-time introduction of Adlene Guedioura to stifle the life out of Tottenham’s midfield and late arrival of Wilfried Zaha off the bench to run the visitors ragged.

‘I just felt we needed more maverick behaviour in the team and that was the reason for the sub at half time and then Wilf came on and gave us the exact reaction I was looking for,” Pardew said after the 2-1 win.

'I left him out to see what his reaction would be. This is a boy whose confidence I think really has to be rekindled and today will do him no harm, those 20 minutes were electrifying.

‘I don't know muich about Guedioura but he was the difference. Dembele was getting too much time on the ball and he stopped him playing.

'In the end it was our discipline that saw us home. We had all the attributes of a great victory and an eventful 90 minutes that has worked out really well for us. I am glad it ended how it did with us having a few more chances.'

Pardew has swapped relentless derision and criticism from Newcastle fans at St James’ Park for the unwavering support of the Selhurst Park crowd and he harnessed their voices by rousing their cheers in the final minutes as Palace worked hard to complete the triumph.

But the former Palace player knows how quickly things in football can change and how fickle football fans can be so he’s refusing to get carried away with a tough trip to fellow relegation fighters Burnley next weekend.

'Football has highs and lows,' he said. 'Spurs put one of the performances of the season in against Chelsea last week and then come here and get beaten by Crystal Palace.

'It will be the same for us if we lose to Burnley, it changes quickly and keep your feet on the floor. It is not straight lines in this game and turning up on time and eating the right food. It is about having a bit of maverick about you somewhere and this team needs a bit of that and today we found it just in time.

'We have a few but it can be withdrawn and I think you can get a bit negative with bad results and your maverick players start playing a bit sensible. You have to get the balance right and second half we did.'
