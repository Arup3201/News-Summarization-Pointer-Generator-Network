Predator: The remains of Kevin Patrick Stoeser, 41, who escaped from a halfway house in Austin, Texas, in October 2012 were found in a field more than a year after he fled

A skull found in a Texas field belongs to an Army veteran convicted of a string of child sex offences who escaped from a halfway house more than a year ago, officials have revealed.

Kevin Patrick Stoeser fled the Austin Transitional Center in October 2013 just weeks before the completing a 10-year prison sentence for multiple offences.

The 41-year-old had sex with girls as young as 13 while stationed at Fort Hood, and was also convicted of abusing five victims as young as 12.

The predator was also caught in possession of child pornography.

Following his escape Stoeser, who was dishonorably discharged from the Army following his conviction, was then placed on the U.S. Marshal's 15 most wanted list.

A $25,000 reward was offered for any information leading to his capture. 

In September a yellow Labrador brought the skull to its owners front yard two miles away from where Stoeser was incarcerated.

The bones were so weathered they were sent to a genetics lab for DNA testing. The results revealed the remains belonged to the former soldier, according to KUVE.

His 'wanted' pages on the US Marshals' and Texas Department of Public Safety were changed on Monday, confirming that he was dead.  

As he came to the end of his sentence, his cellphone was said to have 30 pictures of underage girls. He then managed to escape and was not seen by authorities until his remains were found.  

Robert Almonte, U.S. Marshal for the Western District of Texas, said in a statement: 'With the untimely death of Stoeser, we can now bring closure to this case.' 

'On behalf of the United States Marshals Service, we appreciate the assistance of our law enforcement partners throughout the nation who contributed a great deal of time and energy to see this investigation through.'

Stoeser was dishonorably discharged from the Army in 2003 after he pleaded guilty to carnal knowledge of a child between the ages of 12 and 16, sodomy, possession of child porn and indecent liberties with a child under 16.  

Police are now investigating what happened to the predator. 

Deputy U.S. John Clifton, the lead criminal investigator on the case, said: 'The physical description of the human skull and where it was found sparked U.S. Marshals interest in the case, because it was very similar to key facts concerning our fugitive investigation for Kevin Stoeser.'

End of hunt: Stoeser's page on the Texas Department of Public Safety was updated to say he was 'captured' confirming it was his skull that was found in the Austin field by a Labrador in September 

Facility: He managed to escape from the Austin Transitional Center after a member of staff found 30 pictures of underage girls on his cell phone. A nationwide manhunt was launched to find him
