Bournemouth manager Eddie Howe wants Callum McManaman from Wigan Athletic as he sets his sights on a future in the Barclays Premier League.

Howe has identified McManaman as a winger who can help the Championship leaders kick on during the second half of the season.

The 23-year-old from Huyton, who was Man of the Match in the 2013 FA Cup final when Wigan beat Manchester City, is under contract until 2017

He is likely to command a fee of more than £5million but manager Malky Mackay is in the process of reshaping the struggling team and may sell.

Bournemouth currently sit top of the Championship table having been led there under the management of Howe.
