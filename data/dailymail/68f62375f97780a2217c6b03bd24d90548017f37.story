It looked like an uneven contest when Ruggles the cat squared up to this baby blackbird.

Yet, surprisingly, the fledgling featherweight came out on top.

The bird refused to budge when the large cat crept up on him in the back garden of a house in Cambridge.

As Ruggles went to pounce, the bird stood his ground, causing scaredy-cat Ruggles to rear up.

And
 when Ruggles tried again, the bird did a quick side-step and then flew 
off, in a scene like something out of the escapades of Sylvester the cat
 and Tweety Pie in the Looney Tunes cartoons of the 50s and 60s.

‘It
 was amazing, the bird didn’t seem scared of the cat even though it was 
so much bigger and trying so hard to catch it,’ said photographer Geoff 
Robinson, who captured the scene in his garden.

‘The cat had the bird in his sight several times but no matter what he did he couldn’t catch it.

‘It was just like watching an episode of a Looney Tunes cartoon in my back garden.’

It
 is not the first time Ruggles has been left with his tail between his 
legs.

He once came face to face with a mouse – and failed to catch it.
