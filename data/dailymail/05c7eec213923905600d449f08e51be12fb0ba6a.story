Armed with an angle grinder, hammer and screwdriver, the pair stole this gold and bronze cross. The glass-fronted centrepiece holds the relic

A holy relic said to have been taken from the cross on which Jesus Christ was crucified has been stolen from an Irish monastery.

The miniature artefact brought to Holy Cross Abbey in Thurles, Co Tipperary, in the late 12th century, was taken by two masked men in a brazen daylight raid.

Armed with an angle grinder, hammer and screwdriver, the pair stole a gold and bronze cross about 12in high with a glass-fronted centrepiece used to hold the relic.

It had been stored securely in a steel-bound display case.

Father Tom Breen, parish priest of Holy Cross Abbey, said the relic has been the source of devotion and pilgrimage for the last 900 years.

'I would like to appeal to the thieves in the strongest possible terms not to damage the relic - just leave the artefacts in some church and they will eventually come back to me or we will use a third person,' he said.

'It is impossible to put a value on it commercially or an intrinsic value, and from religious and emotional point of view it's immeasurable.

The 'Relic of the True Cross', as it is referred to by the Archdiocese, was given by Pope Paschal II to the O'Brien Kings of Thomond in recognition for their support for the Catholic Church.

It was they who founded the abbey which was first consecrated by Cistercian monks in about 1180.

The Cistercian Order protected the relic until the monastery was suppressed during the Reformation.

In 1801 it was given to the Ursuline Sisters in Blackrock, Co Cork, by Bishop Francis Moylan before being returned to Holy Cross after restoration in 1975.

'I would in my heart feel that the thieves had no real appreciation of what it is they were taking. I would hope that they didn't have any ulterior motive.'

Archbishop Dermot Clifford, Archbishop of Cashel and Emly, added his voice to appeals for the cross and relic to be returned.

'The high profile of Holy Cross Abbey rests primarily on its possession of this relic. The unlawful removal of this relic is regarded as an outrage by the people of faith who value its spiritual and historic importance,' he said.

'The faithful are extremely upset at the loss of this irreplaceable and sacred relic.

'While it is not of great material value, it holds significant spiritual meaning for the faithful of the Archdiocese of Cashel and Emly and beyond.

'Holy Cross Abbey will never be the same again unless and until the relic is returned.'

The cross housing the relic is known as a monstrance, which sits on a small base and contains a transparent case normally used for holding the communion host.

It was housed in a steel-framed display which the thieves used the angle grinder, hammer and screwdriver to break open.

The thieves also took a 14th-century silver holy cross, again about 12in high, which had been hanging from a chain and contained two crosses and two dark stones.

Three sets of keys had been stolen from the church sacristy in recent weeks. The priests subsequently took precautions to call in locksmiths and change up to ten locks where important artefacts are housed.

Father Breen: 'I would like to appeal to the thieves in the strongest possible terms not to damage the relic'

The
veneration of relics has been a central part of the Catholic faith 
since the fourth century when three crosses were discovered at the hill 
where Jesus is said to have died.

According
to legend, a sick man was brought to touch each of them in turn. After 
touching the third he was miraculously cured, proving its provenance as 
the true cross.

The cross 
was divided up into hundreds of smaller relics, some no more than 
splinters, which were sent to churches and monasteries across Europe 
where they were venerated.

By the Middle Ages, the trade in fakes had become common.

So
many forgeries were thought to be in circulation that Erasmus, the 
Dutch philosopher, quipped that Christ must have been crucified on a 
'whole forest'.

Two women, who had been seen around the church, are suspected of involvement in the theft of the keys.

Gardai
said two men who carried out the theft both had their faces covered and
openly carried the tools into the church. A parishioner passed the two 
men in the church before the theft.

The pair left within a few minutes and fled in a red or wine-coloured VW Touareg jeep which was later found burned out.

Gardai
said a third person had been waiting in the getaway car, which had the 
partial registration number 06 OY or 06 LK, and went in the direction of
Yellow Lough.

The
car was discovered a short time later about two to three miles from the
scene at the Yellow Lough, Thurles, where it had been set on fire.

A dark-coloured saloon car was seen in the vicinity of where the VW Touareg jeep was burnt out, travelling at high speed.

Gardai in Thurles have appealed for witnesses.

The tiny relic was originally brought to the monastery when it was first consecrated by Cistercian monks in about 1180.

It is believed to have been a gift from Donal Mor O'Brien, King of Munster, who founded the abbey.
