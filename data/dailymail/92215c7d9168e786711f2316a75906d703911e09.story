Shake-up: Michael Gove plans to replace GCSEs with a more rigorous, O-level style of exam

Michael Gove will this week press ahead with reforms designed to fix the ‘broken’ exam system as he vows to replace GCSEs with a more rigorous, O-level style of exam.

The Education Secretary is expected to unveil plans to introduce a new qualification before the next election in 2015, arguing that GCSEs ‘haven’t worked’.

There has been a bitter row within the coalition over Mr Gove’s proposals, with Liberal Democrats vowing to oppose any return to a ‘two-tier’ system that would see less gifted children sitting different exams.

The Education Secretary has conceded that the ‘overwhelming majority’ of students should sit the new qualifications - but insists they must properly recognise the best students.

In a little-noticed move, the new Conservative education minister Elizabeth Truss has been handed responsibility for exam reform following last week’s Government reshuffle, rather than Mr Gove’s new Liberal Democrat number two, David Laws.

The proposals will be put out for consultation before the new examination is introduced in 2014.

‘I think one of the things that’s important to stress is that the O-level is an examination which in the past used to be sat by a minority, which is why when people have discussed its potential return they’ve automatically assumed it would be a minority exam,’ Mr Gove said.

‘But in fact, in other jurisdictions, in countries like Singapore, there are examinations which are set which are very reminiscent of the old O-level, but a majority... 80 per cent of students can pass them.

‘I think what we need to do is to have an examination that has all the rigour of the old O-level but which is sat by a majority of students, so that we can ensure that everyone is treated fairly.

‘It’s the aim is that it should be sat by the overwhelming majority. It’s not the case at the moment that every child sits a GCSE. But we want to make sure that this is an examination that can be sat by all children and cover the full range of abilities.’

The Education Secretary says the Government will consult experts, teachers and parents on what the new examination, and its grades, should be called.

‘The aim is to ensure that we have an examination that recognises the genuinely academically gifted by making sure that top grade, an A or whatever it might be called, is clearly a sign of someone who is a high flier, but at the same time, this examination, we hope, will ensure that all children - we hope the majority will take it at 16, some may take it at the age of 17 or 18 - that all children can have their fluency in English, mathematics and other subjects like history and physics recognised.

‘I think it’s important that there’s an appropriate discrimination between the top grades and then a lower pass grade, but the precise details of how that should be done is something that we need to agree collectively.’

The latest figures show that hundreds of state schools are already turning away from the traditional GCSE and offering pupils a tougher international exam based on O-levels.

The number teaching the international GCSE (IGCSE) has soared by 300 per cent since Mr Gove allowed them to start doing so.

Two-thirds of public schools already enter students for the ICGSE, regarded as more challenging and similar to O-levels. Unlike GCSEs, the exams are also favoured because they do not focus on coursework.

Labour banned state schools from adopting IGCSEs in key subjects amid fears they would undermine the domestic version, with schools which sought to get around the ban facing official warnings.

But in June 2010, Mr Gove reversed the ban, insisting schools which believed the international exams would better stretch pupils should be allowed to offer them.
