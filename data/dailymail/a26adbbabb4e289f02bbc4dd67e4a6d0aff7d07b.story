Floyd Mayweather dismissed Conor McGregor's recent comments about being able to 'kill' the boxer inside 30 seconds - claiming he is just being a publicity hound.

With under two weeks to go until his $300milllion fight with Manny Pacquiao, the undefeated champion claims that the Irish UFC star is just looking to gain some attention off the back of the media frenzy surrounding the fight.

He told TMZ Sports: 'I don't take that dude seriously. He's just trying to get himself some publicity.'

Like Mayweather, he's not been shy to show off his flash cars and expensive clothing on his social media sites.

The Irishman's most recent Instagram post is of his BMW 640i M Sport convertible and he captioned it, 'Locking up the bat mobile.'
