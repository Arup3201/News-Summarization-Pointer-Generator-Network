A couple who had a fantasy treehouse built outside their house, complete with a full kitchen, working bathroom and a viewing deck, have been told they have to strip parts of it away to comply with planning law.

Mike and Pat Splinter had a 500 square foot house, supported by concrete struts and with full plumbing and electricity, set up in their garden over Christmas.

The ambitious construction was created for the Treehouse Masters series on Animal Planet, and featured in their festive special episode.

Violation: Planning bosses in Placer County say that the Splinters do not have permission for a working kitchen - so must scrap it

On the show, designer Pete Nelson came to their vineyard in Sacramento, California, to set up the stunning home-away-from-home while the owners were away, at a cost of more than $60,000.

When they came back Nelson and the Splinters made candy canes in the treehouse's working kitchen, which led it to be dubbed the Christmas Candy Kitchen treehouse.

But, according to the Sacramento Bee newspaper, the home got on the wrong side of planning bosses in Placer County, who say the extravagant treehouse oversteps the mark and has to be scaled back.

Dramatic: The threehouse is supported by concrete posts, is fully plumbed and has electricity

Lush: The construction, which cost more than $60,000, is richly furnished inside

They have demanded that the kitchen be stripped out, as well as the mattress in the treehouse's loft bedroom.

The county's deputy planning director, E.J. Ivaldi, said: 'They can use it for entertaining.'

'What the county approved was a residential accessory structure.

'For the purpose of them being able to do a TV show, they were allowed to build a kitchen with the understanding that the kitchen would come out.'

Officials say the harsh criteria are being applied because the couple already has a full guest cottage elsewhere on their vineyard.
