The number of centenarians receiving birthday cards from the Queen has gone up by 17 per cent in just a year.

There are now so many people are now reaching their 100th birthday that the little-known Whitehall office responsible for making sure their milestone is celebrated has had to take on extra staff.

Some 7,517 people have received a Centenarian card from the Palace this year, up from 6,360 in 2013.

A total of 7,517 people have received a Centenarian card from the Queen this year, up from 6,360 in 2013

The cards are sent to British citizens on their 100th, 105th and every subsequent birthday.

The Department of Work and Pensions, which is responsible for checking ages and sending birthday cards from the Queen, has increased the number of employees involved from one to seven in the past five years.

Figures from the Office for National Statistics show that there are now 13,780 people over the age of 100 in Britain, compared with just 6,860 in 2000.

It is now estimated one in three children born today will reach 100.

Pensions Minister Steve Webb said: 'It is a massive source of celebration that more of us are living longer fuller lives and thousands of centenarians have celebrated their 100th birthday with a very special card.

'Our reforms will ensure the state pension remains strong for future generations and I am proud we are protecting today's pensioners with the Triple Lock meaning the basic State Pension is at the highest percentage of earnings since 1992.' 

The number of people over the age of 100 has risen dramatically from around 3,000 in 1983 to more than 13,700 last year

Margaret Wilberforce-Eke, who leads the DWP team in charge of keeping information on centenarians up to date, said: 'Every day we help families mark amazing celebrations. Reaching 100 might be becoming more common, but it is still very special for all those involved.

'It is a privilege to be involved in just a small part of these birthdays – but we hear back that receiving a card is the perfect finishing touch for a great day.'

The DWP Centenarian team, based in Newcastle upon Tyne, contacts people approaching their 100th, 105th and every subsequent birthday who are in receipt of State Pension.

Those not in receipt of State Benefits can make a direct application to Buckingham Palace to receive a celebration card.

Throughout their lives, these centenarians born in 1914 have lived through two world wars, the Cold War and the rise of the information age.

They turned 40 in 1954, when:
