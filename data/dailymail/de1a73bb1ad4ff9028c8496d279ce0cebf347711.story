Professor Dame Sally Davies, who said workers with depression or anxiety should be fast-tracked for NHS treatment 

Workers with depression or anxiety should be fast-tracked for NHS treatment ahead of pensioners and the unemployed with the same conditions, according to the chief medical officer.

Professor Dame Sally Davies said the working days lost when men and women are off sick with mental health issues cost the economy £100 billion a year.

She also urged employers to make it easier for staff who have been on long-term sick leave to come back to work by starting them off on reduced hours.

Around 70 million working days are lost because of stress, anxiety and other mental health conditions each year, a rise of a quarter since 2009.

But campaigners warned that her proposals risked discriminating against pensioners, stay-at-home mothers and the unemployed. 

They claimed that it would undermine one of the founding principles of the NHS, which is that it ‘provides a comprehensive service available to all’, promoting equality by focusing on patients’ clinical need rather than their personal circumstances. 

In a report published today, Dame Sally called on the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, the NHS watchdog, to weigh up the costs of allowing workers with depression or anxiety to be fast-tracked for treatment.

‘The costs of mental illness to the economy are astounding,’ she said.

‘I urge commissioners and decision-makers to treat mental health more like physical health.

‘Anyone with mental illness deserves good quality support at the right time.

‘One of the stark issues highlighted in this report is that 60 to 70 per cent of people with common mental disorders such as depression and anxiety are in work, so it is crucial that we take action to help those people stay in employment to benefit their own health as well as the economy.’

A spokesman for the Department of Health said it was likely that NICE would be in favour of such a policy.

Dame Sally did not indicate whether full-time workers should be prioritised over those who work part-time. But it would follow that their costs to the economy would be far higher if they were off sick.

However, Jenny Edwards, chief executive of the Mental Health Foundation said: ‘Whilst we recognise the benefit of good quality work to mental health we are concerned about the suggestion to focus the fast-tracking of care on people of working age who are at risk of falling out of work.

‘A health service that is free at the point of delivery should “fast-track” all and not discriminate in favour of those who are economically active.

‘We consider that there must be an investment in establishing a suite of evidence-based solutions to mental ill health and support mental well-being, particularly targeted where there are the greatest inequalities.’

As many as 23 per cent of women and 16 per cent of men are suffering from depression or anxiety at any one time, according to NHS figures.

It is thought the number of men with the conditions could be higher, because men can be less inclined to admit they have a problem and avoid seeing their doctor.

Professor Sir Simon Wessely, president of the Royal College of Psychiatrists, said: ‘We endorse the chief medical officer’s call for employment becoming a routine outcome indicator for mental health services – an outcome that has real world relevance and is simple to collect.

‘We also agree that more support is needed to keep those who are at risk of losing their jobs from joining the ranks of the long term sick.'
