Andy Murray goes into his next match at the Miami Open against Colombia’s Santiago Giraldo on Sunday, but his Great Britain Davis Cup colleague James Ward has had to fly home to rest a sore knee.

Ward, the British No 2, has paid a high price for his heroic win over John Isner in Glasgow earlier this month, having lost three first rounds subsequently, and now finds himself out of action for two weeks.

He was due to play in Guadeloupe next week but instead has gone back to London, where he eventually hopes to be able to begin preparation for next month’s clay court events, once his knee has settled down.

Giraldo, Murray's Miami Open opponent on Sunday, is number 31 in the world rankings

Murray, who plays Colombia’s world No 31 Giraldo in the third round on Sunday, expects to team up with Ward this summer at Queen’s Club for the Davis Cup quarter-final against France.

With the newly-extended three-week gap between the French Open and Wimbledon, it will mean six weeks of high profile grass court tennis in the UK, and Murray feels the longer run-in after Paris will help him.

‘I think it’s better for me if there are more weeks on grass,’ he said.

‘A lot of the players will go and spend a week at home after Roland Garros whereas for me I can easily practise on grass, for a lot of the players it’s not easy to get on grass courts.’
