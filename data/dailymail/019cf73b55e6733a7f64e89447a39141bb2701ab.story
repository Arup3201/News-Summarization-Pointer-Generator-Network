A detailed picture of how ‘Mr and Mrs  Average’ live has been built up using data from Facebook.

The study shows how men and women develop new interests as they mature – and how the genders are often out of sync.

While women tend to take exercise seriously from the age of 34, for  example, the average man waits until  his 45th birthday before working hard to  get in shape.

The average woman spends more time talking about sports, politics, career and money as she gets older

Women’s interest in books peaks aged 22, while men become most into literature as they reach their 50s.

And men start to shift their focus 
away from the workplace after age 30, while women do not do so until 
eight years later. Both sexes, however, care most about fashion aged 16.

The research used anonymous data 
donated by thousands of Facebook users, recording the statuses, ‘likes’ 
and ‘interests’ they had posted on their profiles.

It found the average woman talks about television most at 44, while men peak much younger, aged 31.

Men are also most likely to see a film in a cinema at 31 – but women go out to see films most aged only 19.

Men are most interested in travel at 29, women at 27, while women talk most about food and drink at 35, and men at 38.

And if you are middle aged, a fail-safe topic for any audience is the weather – a key  interest for many as they approach 60.

Stephen Wolfram, the British 
scientist who carried out the research, also created the Wolfram Alpha 
search engine used by Apple and Microsoft.

He recently said: ‘It’s almost shocking how much this tells us about the evolution of  people’s typical interests.

‘People talk less about video games as they get older, and more about politics.

The Facebook study found women are most interested in fitness aged 34 while for men they are aged 45

‘Men typically talk more about sports
 and technology than women – and, somewhat surprisingly to me, they also
 talk more about movies, television and music.’

Experts say tracking such details could mean social change is spotted sooner.

Carl Miller, of think-tank Demos, said such monitoring if done in ‘real 
time’ could also detect changes in the public mood. He added: ‘You could
 produce a social media version of the “worm” that ran alongside 
speeches [on TV screens] in the leaders’ debates during the last general
 election, but relying on millions of voices.’

But it may alarm others who feel we 
are already monitored too much online, for example with ‘cookies’ 
tracking browsing and tailoring online adverts to our tastes.

Tracking key words that users post on
 their Facebook walls, a picture is being created of what interests 
people depending on age and gender.

Mr Wolfram said in his blog: 'Some of this is rather depressingly stereotypical.

'And most of it isn’t terribly surprising to anyone who’s known a reasonable diversity of people of different ages.

The age of men and women when their interest peaks on Facebook

Books:    Men - 50                 Women - 22

Fashion: Men - 16                 Women - 16

Fitness:  Men - 45                Women - 34

Health:    Men - 54                Women - 43

Tech:       Men - 34                Women - 22

Sports:    Men - 14 and 18                 Women - 48

'But what to me is remarkable is how 
we can see everything laid out in such quantitative detail [and through 
data analysis create] a kind of a signature of people’s thinking as they
 go through life.'

The 
study revealed that people talk more about politics as they get older 
and are generally more interested in family and friends when in their 
early teens.

But not all subjects split the genders.

Men and women's interest in politics and weather both peak at 60 - the age where the study ends.

There
 is only a six year gap on the subject of pets and animals where women's
 interest peaks on Facebook aged 37 and men aged 43.

Carl Miller, from the think tank Demos, said the live tracking used in this study could be used on a wider scale - from politics to exercise.

The different ages men and women are most interested in books is the biggest gender gap - 28 years

Mr Wolfram was also optimistic about what could be achieved using these methods of live tracking and data science.

He
 said on his blog: 'Over the decades I’ve been steadily accumulating 
countless anecdotal “case studies” about the trajectories of people’s 
lives—from which I’ve certainly noticed lots of general patterns.

'But
 what’s amazed me about what we’ve done over the past few weeks is how 
much systematic information it’s been possible to get all at once. Quite
 what it all means, and what kind of general theories we can construct 
from it, I don’t yet know.

'But it feels like we’re starting to be able to train a serious “computational telescope” on the “social universe”.

'And it’s letting us discover all sorts of phenomena. That have the potential to help us understand much more about society and about ourselves.

'And that, by the way, provide great examples of what can be achieved with data science, and with the technology I’ve been working on developing for so long.' 

One in eight social media users make up things to tweet or put on Facebook

One in eight social media addicts make up things to put on their tweets and status updates, new figures reveal.

And it is because they want to keep up with the star-studded lifestyle of the rich and famous from Justin Bieber to Stephen Fry it seems.

Most reckon their own lives are too humdrum so exaggerate, fib and cheat to make themselves sound more interesting, said the study by Barclaycard Bespoke Offers.

The survey of 2,000 social media users found 12 per cent of social media users regularly 'big up' what's happening in their lives to sound more interesting.

Many are so determined to be on a social media site that they will be economical with the truth when nothing interesting is going on in their lives or they cannot think of something funny to say.

Four in 10 (39 per cent) of social network fibbers put their dishonesty down to pressure from friends and colleagues to have a good time or sound upbeat in their Facebook or Twitter updates.

More than a quarter (29 per cent) admit that their lives are simply too boring without a bit of embellishing on their profiles.Eight in 10 people have made their Facebook updates more colourful, 40 per cent on Twitter and five per cent on other social media web sites.

Examples of fibs include moaning about still being at work while on your way home, claiming to have spotted a celebrity, boosting culture credentials by pretending to visit a museum or art gallery, embellishing restaurant visits and claiming someone else's Twitter joke as your own.

Barclaycard brand ambassador Tom Fletcher, of boy band McFly, said: 'This research shows that social networkers are almost embarrassed by not having a good time.

'But people should not be disappointed by their lives. It's not just about the money. The real social currency lies in going to amazing events and having great experiences you can then share with friends and followers online.'

The research was commissioned by Barclaycard to launch its new 'bespoke offers' personalised shopping service.
