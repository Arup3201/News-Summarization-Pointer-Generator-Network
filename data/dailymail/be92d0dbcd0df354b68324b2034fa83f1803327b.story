A brazen scheme in which guns - even an AK-47 rifle - were taken onto passenger jets for years in carry-on luggage was described by a Brooklyn prosecutor Tuesday as a terrorism threat that should lead to the end of letting workers enter airports without security screening.

'I hope this is a wakeup call for the nation,' Brooklyn District Attorney Kenneth Thompson said at a news conference. 'This was an egregious breach of our nation's air traffic security.'

Thompson commented as he described a case brought against five people, including an airline baggage handler who was charged a day earlier by federal authorities in Atlanta.

Thompson said he was not trying to scare anyone. But he said it's 'truly frightening' what investigators learned after a probe that started as a way to reduce gun violence in Brooklyn.

He said former Delta Air Lines employee Mark Quentin Henry took guns aboard at least 17 commercial airliners this year from Atlanta to New York airports.

Surveillance: Mark Henry (far right under A1 sign) is seen boarding in an Atlanta airport on December 10...

Arrival: ...and later getting off of a plane at JFK airport that same morning at 10:26am. He was arrested December 10 after he was followed to his residence in Brooklyn 

Prosecutors alleged in a release that 'During the course of the investigation it was discovered that Henry, whose mother is a retired Delta employee, traveled back and forth between Georgia and New York for a nominal fee by using his mother’s employee privileges, which allowed him to take unlimited flights for life.'

Henry's lawyer, Terence Sweeney, said his client, held without bail, 'maintains his innocence and he's looking forward to his day in court.'

Henry was arrested December 10, when investigators videotaped him in the Atlanta airport prior to a morning flight to Kennedy International Airport in New York, where he was videotaped leaving the airport and was followed to his residence in Brooklyn.

Thompson said Henry was confronted by investigators at his door, he told them there were guns in a knapsack.

'He said: "I just brought them from Atlanta on the plane." He made that admission,' Thompson said.

The prosecutor said investigators discovered that guns were individually wrapped and that ammunition was in the bag next to them 'that he could have just put together and started shooting.'

He said the scheme 'really poses a threat in terms of terrorism.'

'They can put guns on a plane, they could easily have put a bomb,' Thompson said. 

Authorities said Monday that an Atlanta airline baggage handler suspected of helping smuggle firearms onto passenger jets to New York City has been arrested by federal agents. 

A FBI affidavit said there was enough evidence to charge Delta ramp agent Eugene Harvey, 31, with trafficking firearms, violating airport security and aiding others in the scheme.

Former Delta employee Mark Quentin Henry, who was fired in 2010, was arrested in New York on December 10 in a weapons trafficking investigation after an undercover agent bought a gun from one of his accomplices, according to the affidavit filed on December 19. 

Authorities: Brooklyn DA Kenneth Thompson, seen center, said of the alleged smuggling ring ''This was an egregious breach of our nation's air traffic security' 

Investigators said Eugene Harvey was assigned to work in the baggage transfer room at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport, above, which is within a designated secure area

The investigation targeted firearms that were being sold in New York that had been purchased in the Atlanta area.

Authorities looked at Henry's cellphone, airport surveillance footage and security records and determined that he conspired with Harvey to get the guns past security. 

Cellphone records showed the two had communicated via text message 12 times shortly before Harvey's flight departed Atlanta for New York City on December 10.

When Henry was arrested, authorities confiscated a backpack that contained a smaller bag with 18 handguns inside. Henry told investigators he traveled from Atlanta to New York with the guns and ammunition in his carry-on bag, which would not have made it past TSA screening.

Investigators said Harvey was assigned to work in the baggage transfer room at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport, which is within a designated secure area. 

Investigators said security records show Harvey used his employee access card to enter the secure area just before 7 a.m. the day of Henry's flight to New York.

Investigators said security footage showed Henry carrying a backpack and walking toward a gate in the B concourse around the same time he began texting Harvey. 

Harvey later entered a men's restroom across from the gate where Henry was waiting, and security footage recorded Henry walk into the same restroom soon after. 

A minute later, Henry walked back out carrying the backpack where the guns were later found.

Henry later traveled to the A concourse and flight records show he departed from gate A1, investigators said in the affidavit.

Federal authorities accuse Henry and Harvey of conspiring to smuggle guns through the airport several times. 

Between May and Dec. 10, Henry supplied 129 handguns and assault rifles to a co-conspirator who then made sales to an undercover officer, according to the affidavit.

Henry, a former baggage handler and ramp agent, was fired from the airline for abusing its buddy pass system. He used pass benefits belonging to his mother, a retired Delta gate agent, to arrange for the flight between Atlanta and New York, according to the affidavit.

'Delta is cooperating with authorities in this investigation. We take seriously any activity that fails to uphold our strict commitment to the safety and security of our customers and employees,' airline spokesman Morgan Durrant said in an emailed statement. 

It's unclear if Harvey has an attorney.
