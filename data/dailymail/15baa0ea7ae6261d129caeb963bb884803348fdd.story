She was one of the most photographed women in U.S. history, so it's hard to believe there are still powerful images of Marilyn Monroe which have never seen the light of day.

Now some of the most arresting 'forgotten' shots will go on display in New York after art researchers took more than two years to track them down.

The images of the actress relaxing during filming breaks were taken in the mid-1950s, just as she cemented her reputation as one of the west's most enduring sex symbols

Rare: Some of the most arresting 'forgotten' shots of Marilyn Monroe will go on show in New York after art researchers took more than two years to find them. This shot was taken by sound engineer Lani Carlson

Joking around: Allan Snyder depicted the star with a Mountie during the filming of River of No Return in 1953

Modelling work: This image by Mischa Pelz, a friend of the rising film star, was taken when he was hired to shoot lawn furniture with her as the model soon before the release of Gentlemen Prefer Blondes in 1953

Taken by five photographers, they show her leaning on a helicopter and posing jokingly with a Canadian Mountie as she made films including Niagara and River of No Return.

But it was not easy for photographers to capture the world's most sought-after model - and some resorted to unorthodox means.

One, Lani Carlson, famously pretended he was a Chicago Tribune photographer in need of urgent Associated Press shots to gain half an hour of the film star's time.

In reality he was not a newspaper photographer at all - just a sound engineer for Capitol Records with a hidden talent.

Pierre Vudrag, the founder of Los Angeles firm Limited Runs, began hunting down unseen images of the film star in 2012 after seeing photographs by Allan Snyder of her on the set of Niagara in upstate New York.

Relaxed: This image by Lani Carlson, a sound engineer who faked being a photographer for the Chicago Tribune, showed the film star playing with a dog on film sets. Carlson gained a valuable half hour of her time

Waiting for someone: This image by Milton Greene was taken in April 1956 during filming for Bus Stop

During breaks from filming, the pair 
took pictures as a way of relaxing in the great outdoors, offering a 
different look to the modelled images the public would usually associate
 with the star.

Mr Vudrag went on to scout out unseen images
 from four other photographers - Thomas Kaminski, Milton Greene, Lani 
Carlson and Mischa Pelz.

'We've spent over two-and-a-half years putting this collection 
together, always with an emphasis on making sure we respected Marilyn 
and always trying to stay true to the photographers' visions,' he said.

 'We see a very relaxed, casual Marilyn. She was more herself in these pictures and did not portray the image that she later worked so hard to depict'

- Curator Pierre Vudrag

'It
 was very exciting - I was finding photos that in many instances the 
photographers themselves had not seen since they were originally taken 
over 50 or 60 years ago. I was one of a few people that had ever seen 
these images.

'Because 
Marilyn didn't expect many of these photos would be published or 
generally seen by the public, we see a very relaxed, casual Marilyn.

'She was more herself in these pictures and did not portray the image that she later worked so hard to depict.

'We
 also see her working hard at her craft with the three photos that show 
her working with co-star Montgomery Clift and crew on scenes for a film.

'People's perception of 
Marilyn is that she was not a serious actress, which is far from the 
truth and is evident by these photos.'

Other images include the star in a white button-down, modelling lawn furniture and posing with a horse during the filming of River of No Return in 1953.

Marilyn: The Lost Photos was first seen in May when the show travelled to Hollywood and San Francisco.

It will reopen tomorrow at the Sumo Gallery in Manhattan, running until this Saturday.

Her real name Norma Jeane Mortenson, Marilyn was 36 when she died of a barbiturate overdose in 1962.

She was married to the baseball star Joe DiMaggio and the playwright Arthur Miller, and it has long been claimed she had affairs with President John F Kennedy and his brother Robert.

However, her last years were marked by illness and personal trauma. It has never been proved conclusively whether her death was a suicide or an accident.
