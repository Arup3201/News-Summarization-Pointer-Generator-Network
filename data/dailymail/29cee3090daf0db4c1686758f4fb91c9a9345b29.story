Mick Jagger landed in Los Angeles today to start making funeral preparations for tragic girlfriend L'Wren Scott as the rest of the Rolling Stones returned to Britain.

The 70-year-old rocker cut short the band's tour of Australia after the fashion designer's body was found in her Manhattan apartment on Monday.

Jagger's spokesman said that he is in Los Angeles being comforted by his children - daughters Karis,
 Elizabeth, Georgia May and Jade as well as his son James.

Hours after he touched down in the 
California city, the other members of the group, Keith Richards, 
Charlie Watts and Ronnie Wood, arrived at Manston airport, in Kent, 
aboard their logo-embossed private jet.

It remains unclear as to who has the 49-year-old's body, and the plans for where she will be buried have not been released either. 

Earlier this week, Scott's sister Jan Shane, who hadn't spoken to the designer in nearly six years, told MailOnline that she hoped she would be buried in the family's plot in Ogden, Utah, next to her adoptive parents.

The Rolling Stones left Australia, with the group's private plane departing Perth Airport at 2.55pm, with Mick Jagger and his fellow bandmates on board.

Jagger, wearing dark sunglasses and black cap, was dropped at the plane's boarding steps as he prepared for his journey home.

Pilots lodged a flight plan at Perth airport listing Abu Dhabi as the first destination. Jagger then flew back to the U.S.

On Wednesday night, the same night the Rolling Stones were due to perform in front of more than 15,000 fans for the first show of their sold-out tour, drummer Charlie Watts played to just 130 people at the city's tiny Ellington Jazz Club

The Rolling Stones left Perth's Hyatt Regency 
at 2pm on Thursday, filing into five separate cars in a military-style  motorcade.

Police closed roads while detectives and uniformed police - some wearing
 bullet-proof vests - escorted the band to Perth airport. Each of the 
five cars had heavily tinted glass, along with rear-window curtains.

The band left Australia only a few hours after a New York medical examiner ruled that the death of Ms Scott was a suicide. Police confirmed she did not leave a note.

Today, Frontier Touring has confirmed it is working on new dates for the 
Rolling Stones' Australian tour. Concert promoters said the band's shows
 may be held after the football season in either October or November, News.com.au reported.

On Wednesday night, the same night 
the Rolling Stones were due to perform in front of more than 15,000 
screaming fans for the first show of their sold-out tour, drummer 
Charlie Watts played to just 130 people at the city's tiny Ellington Jazz 
Club.

The club was 
closed to the public when Watts performed, but jazz fans already inside 
were treated to the surprise 45-minute performance from the Rolling 
Stones drummer.

Club 
director Graham Wood told MailOnline that the 72-year-old drummer was 
‘private and quiet’ during his two hours at the club. But he said Watts 
came alive when he walked onto the stage, even treating fans to a 
jazz-style version of Rolling Stones' mega-hit Honky Tonk Woman.

‘There was talk of Charlie coming on 
Monday. But obviously with the way things unfolded, it didn’t happen,’ 
Mr Wood told MailOnline.

‘He
 got here around 11pm and stayed a good couple of hours. He was fairly 
private. He had his entourage and security there. He was pretty keen to 
just quietly enjoy the music.

‘We had a full house of about 130, and they didn’t really know what was happening.

‘He played a kind-of slow, swing version of Honky Tonk Woman. The place just erupted. People couldn’t believe it.’

Watts had been expected to play at the club earlier in the week as part of saxophonist Tim Ries' Rolling Stones Project when the news of L'Wren Scott’s death altered his plans.

Kaitlyn Elsegood, who was at the club, told MailOnline that Watts arrived and took up a spot in a quiet corner, going largely unnoticed by most people. But she said the Stones drummer’s demeanor changed as soon as he hit the stage.

‘He was sitting in the bar the whole time, but he was sitting quietly in the corner having a drink.

‘Not many people noticed he was there. But he was very relaxed on stage. He played for about 45 minutes. 

‘He didn’t really say anything. He was just happy to play.’

The Rolling Stones released a statement overnight expressing their support for Jagger, saying 'the death of L'Wren Scott is terrible news and they are pulling together' around the band frontman.

The impromptu gig followed Watts telling MailOnline that Mick Jagger had been left dazed and unwell following the apparent suicide on Monday.

'He's holding up. He's okay,' Watts said earlier that night, adding: 'He's not really well. He's not really here. It was such a shock.'
