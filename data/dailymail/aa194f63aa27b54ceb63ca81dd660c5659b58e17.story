Ed Miliband was accused of playing ‘political games’ over HS2 by Nick Clegg yesterday.

His intervention stepped up pressure on the Labour leader as his party appeared to change its stance to back the £50billion rail project.

The Deputy Prime Minister added that he would not compromise on HS2 in any future talks with Labour about forming a government.

Under fire: Nick Clegg accused Labour leader Ed Miliband of 'playing political games' with the HS2 project

Mr Clegg said the idea was inherited from Labour and it was ‘pathetic... that when it becomes politically convenient to play games with it, they start playing games with it’.

Senior sources in the party said Labour would throw its support behind it as long as the incoming chairman, former Olympics supremo Sir David Higgins, is given a free rein to bring down the costs - particularly the £14billion earmarked as a contingency fund.

Both Ed Balls and the new transport spokeswoman Mary Creagh have been notably lukewarm about the project, claiming they still support the principle but not ‘at any cost’ and attacked the government for ‘mismanagement’ after the budget rose by £10bn.

Ministers say the link is vital to Britain’s future prosperity as HS2 will allow trains to travel at 225mph, reducing journey times but also providing much-needed capacity on the overcrowded route.

Yesterday David Cameron, who has suggested the rail link from London to Birmingham, Manchester and Leeds, will not go ahead without public support, accused Mr Miliband of ‘flip flopping’.

Non negotiable: Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said he would not compromise on the £50billion rail project in any future talks with Labour about forming a government

At Prime Minister’s Questions, he accused Labour of putting the project at risk. He said: ‘Let us just examine what has happened with HS2 this week. The shadow chancellor touring the radio studios telling everyone it won’t go ahead.

‘Labour local authority leaders begging the leader of the opposition to stand up this infrastructure scheme. And what has he done? Cowered in his office too weak to make a decision.

‘We all know it needs cross party agreement to make this important infrastructure scheme go ahead and what a pathetic spectacle we’ve seen this week - one minute they’re for it then they’re against it and the leader of the opposition too weak to make a decision.’

As the row escalated Ed Balls, the shadow chancellor, was heard to shout across the chamber: ‘I’m just doing what the chancellor should be doing.’

No 'flip-flopping': David Cameron accused Labour of putting HS2 at risk

Nick Clegg then upped the pressure by indicating that support for the rail link would be a red line in any coalition discussions with Labour at the next election, if the final decision falls after 2015.

Last night a Labour sources said they would vote with the government today on a law which allocates the funds for the project, but does not give the green light to construction

The project, on which around £1billion has already been spent, faces many more parliamentary hurdles before work can begin as planned in 2017.

But a party insider said: ‘We support HS2, we will support the bill tomorrow, but its right that we don’t give the government a blank cheque.’

Asked if he would ever compromise on HS2 in a future government, Mr Clegg said ‘no’, accused Labour of playing ‘political games’, and said business leaders in his Sheffield constituency were ‘absolutely appalled at the way in which Labour appears to be betraying the north.’

He said: ‘It just beggars belief for a party that constantly parades itself as the authentic voice of the north of England is now prepared to turn its back on the businesses, the communities, the families which I think all the evidence shows will benefit disproportionately from an investment in a high speed north-south railway link.

‘I just think it is miserable, it’s pathetic that an idea which we inherited from Labour and in all good faith took forward because we thought, given they were the architects of the idea they might support it, that when it becomes politically convenient to play games with it, they start playing games with it.’

Mr Clegg’s spokesman later tried to play down his remarks, saying that the party was not setting out its red lines yet.

Labour MP Graham Stringer accused the leadership had misjudged the party’s enthusiasm for the project.

He said: ‘I think the leadership of the labour party misjudged the mood, not just of the Parliamentary Labour Party but the Labour party in the whole of the country. Rather than just trying to undermine the project, Ed and the rest of them should be out campaigning strongly for it.’

Sir Albert Bore, leader of Birmingham City council, writing on behalf of councils in Leeds, York, Liverpool and Manchester, warned of a ‘protracted public conflict’ if Labour failed to support it.
