Arrested: Thomas Standley, 28 (photographed), was arrested and charged with assaulting his 93-year-old girlfriend, Willie Frances Robinson

A Tennessee man was arrested and charged with assaulting his 93-year-old girlfriend because she refused to take her medication, police say.

Twenty-eight-year-old Thomas Standley was arrested Tuesday at the Memphis home he shared with Willie Frances Robinson, 93, after allegedly choking her, squeezing her arms and shaking her violently, NBC news reports.

A court affidavit describes the woman as Standley's 'girlfriend/roommate,' but the 93-year-old told WMC Action News 5 that is not entirely true.

'I'm 93 and he's 28. That doesn't go together ,' Robinson said. 'He was staying with me and working full time. He fed me my meals and my medicine.

'It was no love, no sex, no nothing. It was just work.'

Officers were called to the home by Robinson's daughter, Patricia Haynes. Haynes, who lives next door to the two, told police that she heard her mother yelling 'Let go of me, you're hurting me,' the affidavit states.

When she went to check on her mother, Standley pushed her out of the door, police say. Her mother continued to yell, so Haynes called the police. 

When the police showed up, Robinson told them that Standley had grown angry with her after she refused to take her medication, according to NBC reports.

She said her arms hurt but refused medical treatment. She told police that this isn't the first time Standley has hurt her.

She said Standley hurts her often, though he is supposed to look after her. She told police she was afraid to call the police because she was afraid of him

Robinson also said that Standley talked her into signing over her power of attorney and resisted her attempts to undo it, according to NBC. 

Standley was charged with domestic assault and is being held in Shelby County jail. He is set to appear in court Thursday, reports say.
