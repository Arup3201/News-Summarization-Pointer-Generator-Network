Foul-mouthed parents launched a bitter tirade at grotto staff dressed as Santa's elves and fairies in front of their children when a Groupon deal turned sour at the weekend.

More than 2,000 families turned up to last weekend's St. Nicholas Fayre in York clutching a voucher from the discount website promising a magical Christmas train ride at the grotto.

But the atmosphere turned nasty when staff, decked out in festive fancy dress, were verbally abused after informing families that the website had got it wrong and that there was in fact no train ride.

Voucher blunder: Groupon are at the centre of claims they issued false information tempting 2,000 families to travel to York for a Santa's grotto train ride that didn't exist

As queues grew so long outside the grotto that children couldn't get in, tempers frayed and parents started to shout and swear at overwhelmed grotto staff.

Tearful and crying children watched while parents shouted at staff forcing one elf to quit and a woman dressed as a Christmas tree to complain that she had been targeted for abuse.

Grotto organiser Penny Ward said: 'One man even verbally threatened the lady who is dressed as a Christmas tree.

'One of the elves was so upset that she has resigned. It was a complete nightmare. Children were crying and upset.'

She added that most of the abusive parents had travelled from Newcastle during last weekend's popular Christmas market in the picturesque city.

The grotto was only able to handle 40 children an hour, she said and explained that dedicated staff had worked beyond their normal hours and without breaks to try to ensure excited children did not miss out.

Penny had initially been contacted by Groupon and agreed to use its services to help publicise the grotto, but she claimed she had never signed a contract and did not say there would be a train ride.

She thought that the York grotto, which runs in York's winter wonderland until Christmas Eve, might have been mixed up with a grotto she ran in Hull, where there was a train ride.

A Groupon spokesman said: 'Owing to a technical error, we apologise that the picture and wording used in this promotion may have indicated that a train ride was available at York Winter Wonderland when this wasn't the case. We regret any disappointment this may have caused.

'Although advanced booking is not essential, preferred time slots cannot be guaranteed without prior booking and are subject to availability. We hope that this hasn't taken away from the Santa's grotto experience and we wish everyone a happy holiday season.'

The website said it had corrected the promotion as soon as it discovered the error and had yesterday sent out a bulk email clarifying what was included in the promotion for customers that were yet to redeem their vouchers.

Groupon is an international organisation which uses collective buying power to offer huge discounts on things to do, eat, see and buy.

Recipe for disaster: Rachel Brown had to draft in 25 staff as demand surged for her cupcakes

But it has run into controversy in the past few weeks with companies claiming that they have been unaware of the impact the deals can have on their businesses.

Last month baker Rachel Brown, from Woodley, near Reading, told how, who normally makes 100 cupcakes a month, found herself having to bake an astonishing 102,000 after posting an offer on Groupon.

Disastrously, because the 50-year-old's deal 
had been so generous and the demand so huge, she made a loss on every 
order â€“ wiping out her profits for the entire year.

And yesterday the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) 
launched an investigation into Groupon after regulators complained the 
daily deals website broke advertising regulations on almost 50 occasions
since the start of the year.

The company debuted on the IPO stock exchange last month and, after an early rise, slumped below $20 on concern about competition from rival LivingSocial and how the European debt crisis might affect overseas growth.

However, Groupon released strong early holiday sales numbers this week and executives said international growth remains strong.

Groupon shares rose more than 7 per cent to an intraday high of $20.82 on Friday. The stock was up 5.5 per cent to $20 in late-morning trading.
