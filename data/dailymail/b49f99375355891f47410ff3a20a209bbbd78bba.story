Arsenal looks like being the next club on 15-year-old child star Martin Odegaard’s tour of England, with the schoolboy, who has already played for the Norwegian national side, auditioning major clubs before he makes a decision as to whom to join.

Manchester City, Manchester United, Barcelona, Real Madrid and Bayern Munich are also on the trail of the teenager, who spent last week training at Liverpool and looks likely to make a decision based on where he has the most chance of developing and making the first team quickly.

Odegaard will be guided in negotiations by his father, Hans Erik, who was a professional footballer in the Norwegian league and who is now the assistant manager at Norwegian club, Mjondalen.

Arsenal are next in line to have a look at Norwegian youngster Martin Odegaard 

Odegaard junior made his international debut for Norway against the United Arab Emirates in August and then became the youngest player ever to feature in a European Championship qualifier, when he came on Norway against Bulgaria in October aged 15 years, 253 days.

In the Norwegian close season he is currently negotiating with all the major clubs in Europe and is expected to spend time training at most of them before making a decision, with all the Premier League clubs still hopeful he can be persuaded to join them. 

United and Arsenal however will emphasise Louis van Gaal and Arsene Wenger’s willingness to blood teenagers in the first eleven, which would give them an advantage.

Brendan Rodgers can point to Raheem Sterling’s development as an example as to how Odegaard might develop at Liverpool. Most observers consider him the most talented teenage player seen for years.

At 15, the teenage sensation is the youngest player ever to represent Norway
