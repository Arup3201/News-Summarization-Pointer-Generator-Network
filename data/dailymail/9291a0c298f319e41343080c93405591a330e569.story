A mother who didn't know she was pregnant is in shock after she gave birth down the toilet - for the second time.

Stunned Kirsty Parker, 25, went to the loo with stomach pains but minutes later suddenly went into labour.

Before she knew what was happening her 3lb 40z baby daughter Ruby had arrived - and landed in the toilet bowl.

She fished the newborn out of the water and mother and baby are both doing well since the dramatic arrival.

The unexpected birth came just nine months after her previous child Amber was born - also down the toilet.

Kirsty had shown no signs of pregnancy apart from gaining a small amount of weight and feeling 'a little moody'. 

She was at her mother Angie Parker's home in Torrington, Devon, last week when Ruby, her second child, arrived in the lavatory. 

Kirsty said: 'I just thought I was coming down with a stomach bug. I had been having slight pains since around 2.30pm but I wasn't worried about them at all.

'It seemed to happen so quickly. One minute I was fine, and the next minute I had given birth to a baby down the toilet.'

Kirsty said she screamed for her Angie, to come upstairs and they both struggled to get the tiny baby out of the toilet before she was taken to hospital.

She had previously given birth to Ruby's sister Amber down the toilet at her own home.

Baby Ruby is in North Devon District Hospital in the special care baby unit as she weighs only 3Ib 4oz.

Doctors believe she was ten weeks premature but she's doing well.

Kirsty said: 'Who needs to go to hospital to give birth? I'm still in shock really. I think it's more that I just did not know I was pregnant.

Kirsty's nine-month-old baby Amber was also born into the toilet but that time Kirsty knew she was pregnant

'I'm religious when it comes to taking the pill daily and I didn't have any morning sickness. I had been a little moody beforehand but I just put that down to lack of sleep from having Amber.'

When Kirsty told her partner Lee Wren on the phone what had happened he said he did not believe her.

Lee, 34, said: 'I thought she was joking, it was just a complete shock.'

Baby Ruby is sister to Kirsty's  daughter Crystal Stevenson, seven, Lee's two sons Harry, five, and Ronnie, four, and the couple's baby Ambe, nine months.

Kirsty's mother said: 'It's all quite a shock but I think there are some things in life you can control and this is not one of them. Ruby was obviously just meant to be.'

But it wasn't just Ruby and and Amber who were born in the bathroom. Kirsty has revealed that she also had Crystal on the bathroom floor of her mother's home.

Kirsty said: 'As all my previous births have been in a bathroom - that is obviously just where I like to have my children.

'I had my first child Crystal who was born eight weeks early on the bathroom floor. That was a shock but I knew I was pregnant with her - and with Amber - but on neither occasion did I know I was in labour.' 

Kirsty said she did not have any morning sickness - and thought she had just struggled shifting the baby weight from Amber's birth nine months previously.

She said: 'If I knew I was pregnant there are things I would have done differently.

'I would not have had any coffee or egg mayonnaise. I am very good when I am pregnant and fortunately I am not a very big drinker anyway.

'I did feel guilty about some of these things but both Lee and my mum said I shouldn't as I had no idea I was pregnant.'
