An Oregon man wasted little time landing himself back in jail.

Christopher Franklin Weaver, 33, was arrested for an attempted robbery at a local bank less than an hour after he was released from prison.

Weaver left Lane County Jail in Eugene, Oregon, at 11am on Thursday and walked about a mile to the Pacific Continental Bank he was caught sticking up.

Time is money: Christopher Franklin Weaver, who was arrested for an attempted robbery less than an hour after he was released from prison

He was arrested on the spot and brought back to Lane County Jail 55 minutes after his initial release.

Nobody was injured during the alleged robbery.

‘This is pretty fast, someone getting released at 11:00 and then they arrive back 55 minutes later,’ Sgt. Carrie Carver of the Lane County Sheriff’s Office told ABC News.

‘I can’t say it’s the shortest time, but it’s certainly the most notable because of the nature of the crime.’

Free: Weaver was released from Lane County Jail in Eugene, Oregon, at 11am on Thursday

Stick up: Weaver tried to rob a nearby Pacific Continental Bank in the same hour

Back again: Weaver returned to Lane County Jail before noon

Weaver was initially incarcerated for parole violations for sex abuse and for unlawful use of a vehicle.

He now faces federal bank robbery charges on top of that.

Authorities at the Lane County Sheriff’s Office could not say whether or not Weaver has been assigned an attorney.

The judge at his latest court hearing said Weaver will be locked up for ‘as long as the feds pay for that bed,’ Carver told ABC.
