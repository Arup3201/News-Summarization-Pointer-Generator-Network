Released: Convicted child sex offender Cory Roberts has been freed from prison

The Washington mother of a young rape victim was horrified to hear that the violent sex offender who left her three-year-old daughter permanently brain damaged has been freed.

Cory Roberts, a repeat offender, was moved to a halfway house in Tacoma on Monday.

A technicality has meant that Roberts has been released rather than being committed for life to a secure facility for predators.

Roberts spent 24 years in prison for the violent attack on Kelly McGinnis's daughter, who he had been asked to babysit.

Two weeks ago, officials contacted Ms McGinnis to tell her that the 37-year-old was due to be released.

'It just tears me apart that he's out. He's done with his sentence and my daughter is 
continuing to serve her life sentence,' Ms McGinnis told Komo4.

Her
 daughter was left partially blind, brain damaged, and has to use leg 
braces to walk.

She has the mental capacity of a 10-year-old and can 
still remember parts of the attack at her home in 1990.

Ms McGinnis said her daughter is still terrified of Roberts and constantly asks if he is still in prison.Â 

For now, 
Ms McGinnis said, she will pretend he is in prison because she fears her daughter 
would not be able to cope knowing he had been freed.

Dark past: A newspaper clipping of Roberts, who was 13 when he brutally attacked a three-year-old girl

After
 being sent to a juvenile detention center, Roberts raped two boys who 
shared a cell with him, and in 2001 he was accused of raping another young child.

Ms McGinnis agreed to talk about the brutal attack on her daughter, to let people know Roberts had been freed.

'I want people to know he's out, what 
he's capable of, of what he could do to somebody else, another child,' 
she said.

'I cannot sit by and just let this happen. I can't not say 
anything because he's a monster,' Ms McGinnis said, adding that she feared he could attack again.

The Washington Department of Corrections had tried to block Roberts' release, possibly for life, but a legal loophole has led to him being placed under a community supervision order instead.

'The
 crime Roberts was convicted of 24 years ago when he was 13 is among the
 worst imaginable,' a spokesman for King County Prosecutor's office said.

Offender: The department of corrections wanted Roberts to be detained for life

'We have detained him using a petition under the 
Sexually Violent Predator (SVP) Civil Commitment statute for the past 11
 years.

'[But] as we neared the trial date, experts retained by the 
state concluded that Roberts did not have the kind of "mental 
abnormality" that we must prove to a jury in order to obtain an order of
 involuntary civil commitment.'

A letter, shown on KiroTV, has been sent by the police department to homes in the neighborhood where 
Roberts will be kept under a supervision order for the next 21 months.

In
 it, it states that Roberts 'admitted to sexually assaulting several 
other females' and did not take part in any sex offender treatment 
during his sentence.

Roberts must register as a child sex offender but he will not be required to wear an ankle bracelet to track his moves.
