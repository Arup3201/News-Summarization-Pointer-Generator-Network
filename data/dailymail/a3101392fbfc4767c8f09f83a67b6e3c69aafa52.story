A mere 24 hours after it launched, the website which allows you to send angry notes and glitter to your enemies, is now up for sale. 

The new company, founded by 22-year-old Sydneysider Matthew Carpenter, promised the public that immature pranks were the best solution and pioneered the genius idea.

However, he has now put ShipYourEnemiesGlitter.com up for sale, claiming he has already made a five-figure sum and is ready to let someone else take over.

22-year-old Sydneysider Matthew Carpenter has announced that he is selling his young company ShipYourEnemiesGlitter after he received an unprecedented amount of orders 

Taking to his Twitter and Facebook accounts, Carpenter announced his retirement from the young company and publicly put it up for sale, hinting he is overwhelmed by the amount of orders the company has received.

'ShipYourEnemiesGlitter with 1m visits, 270k social shares, $xx,xxx in sales, tonnes of people wanting to order. 24 hours old. For sale.' his post said.  

The news may not come as a much of a surprise to some, after Carpenter previously admitted that 'he hates glitter.'

Carpenter is the genius behind the innovative idead, which went viral worldwide within hours 

The next big thing: ShipYourEnemiesGlitter.com promises to send an envelope full of glitter to your enemies 

'I'm a 22 year old dude that has too much free time apparently because now my plans for the next few weeks will consist of sending stupid glitter to terrible people,' Carpenter told Daily Mail Australia. 

'People call it the herpes of the craft world,' the website said.

'Pay us money, provide an address anywhere in the world and we'll send them so much glitter in an envelope that they'll be finding it everywhere for weeks.'

The website was launched on Tuesday night and went viral worldwide within hours.

'The website is just over 24 hours old. We've had over 1.3m visits, 250k social shares so the response has been pretty intense,' said Carpenter. 

Part  of the appeal is that each package will be individually 'wrapped with hate' by Carpenter himself for the incredibly low price of $9.99 per envelope.

The hateful envelopes may seem harmless, with some people on Social Media expressing confusion at the concept due to their personal love of glitter.  

However, the frustration felt when covered with seemingly endless pieces of glitter cannot be fully understood unless one has experienced the twinkly torture.

It sticks to clothes, skin, hair and furniture and somehow has the creepy ability to pop up when least expected for weeks after the glitter ambush.

So why should someone use this website to send the sparkly packages?

The website founders explain that packaging the envelopes is an extremely messy process.

People who use the service can now cause the maximum amount of irritation to their enemy without any personal pain.

Although many people may think glitter is 'fun', they are wrong as it can be used as a harmless but intensely irritating torture 

'We're making a heroic sacrifice. (Glitter) gets all over our working space,' the ShipYourEnemiesGlitter team explain. 

'You can do it yourself if you want. But then you have to handle the glitter, making your own house full of glitter.'

These envelopes from hell, known in some circles as 'glitter bombs', are the perfect form of anonymous vengeance which the website promises to do for the bargain price of $9.99.

The website even generously gives the option of including a hateful note in the envelope to really hammer the message home.  

The unique commercial endeavour has paid off as just hours after launching the website was forced to suspend purchases.

'You guys have a sick obsession with shipping people glitter,' Carpenter explained.  

Although some believe the website is just a gag, the administrators promise the company is real, explaining 'we spent too much time, money and resources putting this... website up to not get paid for it.'

Rave reviews, as well as complaints from unhappy envelope recipients, indicate the product's effectiveness

The glitter will stick to every possible surface of the recipient's body and home and will continually and inexplicably appear for weeks after the ambush

The way it works is simple. When on the website, 'click the buy button. Decide whose day you want to ruin and then enter their address.'

The website already has glowing reviews from thrilled customers, including gleeful Grady Chambers:

'I bought this for my husband, he opened the mail before work & got it everywhere! He had to change, was late for work and might be getting fired, LOL!'

However, Alma Henry warned people to not underestimate the power of glitter.

'For my one year anniversary I didn't know what to get my wife, so I bought this thinking it would be funny. 

'It wasn't, I'm now divorced, broke and living with my best friend. I'd like to talk with the owner to get a refund and discuss damages.'  

The website has a helpful FAQ section, although they point out 'Yes, somehow we do have Frequently Asked Questions'

A thrilled customer wrote a reference, explaining ''I bought this for my husband, he opened the mail before work & got it everywhere! He had to change, was late for work and might be getting fired, LOL!'
