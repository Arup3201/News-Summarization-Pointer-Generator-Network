A teenage girl who smothered her mother to death with a pillow after years of 'mental cruelty' in their troubled relationship has been jailed for nearly five years.

Rebecca Durkin, 19, from Southport, Merseyside, admitted strangling her 55-year-old mother Clancy but denied murder saying she had not intended to kill her.

However, sentencing her to four years and eight months in prison for manslaughter, Judge Clement Goldstone, QC, told the student that he was sure she had intended to kill her and had smothered not strangled her.

'I am sure on this occasion you lost your self-control. You smothered your mother with a pillow as you had tried to a greater or lesser extent on two previous occasions in weeks earlier,' the judge said.

'On this occasion you smothered her with a pillow possibly in the course of a further argument superimposed upon others which had happened earlier that evening. 

'You resisted her efforts to struggle during which I am satisfied she scratched your face and you smothered her for about 15 seconds.'

Liverpool Crown Court heard that it 'had been a disaster waiting to happen.'

The judge told Durkin, who showed no emotion during the hearing, that he did not accept her suggestion that she had not intended to kill her mother, who was suffering with alcoholism. 

'I am sure you did. You had had enough and that is something you will have to live with for the rest of your life,' the judge said.

Referring to their relationship he said: 'Although in many respects and in difficult circumstances your mother did her best for you and you for her, it was clear that over a period of years you suffered long term mental cruelty at her hands.'

'Her addiction to alcohol for many years which she managed to keep from her close family clouded her judgement and it was drink which affected her ability to behave as a normal mother should.

'Sadly a picture has been painted of a young girl who was belittled and under-valued and had to withstand the sort of pressure which no teenager should have to.'

He said it was not a constant picture as they had enjoyed some good times. 

'Your mother was, I think, like the girl with a curl in the nursery rhyme who when she was good was very good and when she was bad she was horrid,' he said.

'I am satisfied your relationship with your mother had been continuing in a gradual spiral for many years.

He pointed out that after the killing at their home in Southport on the evening of January 6, Durkin returned to a friend's home and the next day feigned shock and surprise at the death of her mother, who worked as a domestic at Southport Hospital.

She tried to claim, at a friend's suggestion, that an intruder may have been to blame after a post-mortem examination found that Clancy had died from asphyxiation. 

A jury cleared the student and part-time care worker of murder at a trial in June after agreeing she had lost control after being provoked. 

During the trial, the jury heard how Durkin, who has an IQ of 80, had been unable to cope with the pressure of wanting to leave home and her mother's wish for her to stay.

She agreed to stay with her mother, whose number she had stored under 'The Evil B***h', if she promised to stop drinking.

However, Clancy started drinking again and on night of the incident, they rowed before Durkin returned home to get some belongings so she could stay overnight with a friend.

They had a further argument and shortly afterwards Durkin rang a friend and said: 'I've killed my mum, I swear down I've done it.'

The next morning she returned home and rang 999 saying she had found her mother 'all blue' on the floor.

Simon Medland, QC, defending, said, 'Here was a disaster waiting to happen. There was a most appalling set of circumstances building up between the deceased and the defendant.

'It is a tragedy worth remarking upon that the deceased's life although tried to make it good and in many ways was a good mother as best she could it fell very far short of the mark on occasion.'

Durkin admitted manslaughter in April and was jailed for four years and eight months by Judge Goldstone today who told her: 'Your family life may have been a very sad and very difficult one but that family is now totally destroyed and split by what you did.'
