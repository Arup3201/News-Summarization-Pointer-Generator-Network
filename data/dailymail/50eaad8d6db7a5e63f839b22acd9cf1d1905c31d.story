A mother whose 12-year-old daughter suffered fatal injuries after being thrown from the trunk of a moving car in Texas has been arrested.

Yasmin Lewis, 32, was a passenger in a Chevrolet Malibu being driven back from a swimming trip in Crowley, Fort Worth, last month, when four of six children aged eight to 14, who were sitting on the trunk and hood, fell off.

According to police, the driver, Kisha Young, 39, didn't want the children to ride inside her car with wet bathing suits.

Three of the children were hurt, and treated in hospital, while Lewis’s daughter, Octavia Watkins, died in hospital on June 25 from head injuries.

Lewis has been charged with reckless injury to a child causing serious bodily injury, according to the Star-Telegram.

The children had been on a playdate at the Creekside Community Pool.

Witnesses who saw the accident said that the children were flung from the car at a tight corner and Young kept on driving - apparently unaware that her passengers had come off the vehicle.

Young, the 38-year-old driver and mother to some of the children, was arrested on suspicion of intoxication assault, a third-degree felony.

Incident: The children came off the car at the 400 block of Angler Drive in Crowley, about 15 minutes from downtown Fort Worth, about 8:30 p.m

'Officers were advised that the driver and passenger of the vehicle mothers of the children allowed the children to ride outside the vehicle because their clothes were wet,' police the department stated in a news release to The Star Telegram.

Spokeswoman C.C. Meadows, said that the investigation is trying to determine exactly what caused the children to come off the car, but they suspect alcohol and driver error.

Young was taken into custody after failing a breathalyzer test on the spot. 

Playdate: The children were at he Creekside Community Pool, according to police

Short distance: The journey should have taken less than a minute
