Gus Poyet says there can be no more excuses for the shortcomings of his Sunderland side after signing Jermain Defoe from Toronto FC.

The Black Cats head coach has repeatedly bemoaned the attacking personnel available to him at the Stadium of Light.

Indeed, Sunderland are the Premier League’s second-lowest scorers with just 18, but Poyet said: ‘There is no doubt we all needed a lift, and the club is a different club today. I’ve got no doubts about that.

‘It doesn’t happen that way very often, and it’s not very often we’re in a position where we can bring in a player of the quality of Jermain Defoe.

‘But we’ve got him here, and we have to use him in the right way now. There are no excuses now. I am responsible, and I’m telling you there are no excuses now, so whatever happens from this point onwards is down to me.

‘I cannot say one thing one day and then change when it suits me. We were missing something in front of goal, but now we’ve got Jermain. Now I need to keep him fit and playing, and find a way with Jermain on the pitch to make him score goals. That’s my challenge now.’

Poyet has revealed that he used his friendship with Defoe – who he worked with at Spurs - to get the deal started, before handing over to sporting director Lee Congerton to thrash out the terms of his £80,000-per-week contract.

Poyet was pleased with how quickly Sunderland moved to sign Defoe ahead of their league rivals 

The Uruguayan – who could now start Defoe at White Hart Lane – explained: ‘When the club was happy to start finding out about the possibility, I talked to Jermain. Simple.

‘I knew that Jermain would tell me the truth. He wouldn’t say, “Let me wait and see, and maybe I’ll give you an answer next week or in another week’s time”. It was straightforward.

‘When I knew what Jermain told me, I went back to Lee and said, “Now the ball is on your side of the court”. As soon as I spoke to Jermain, I knew we had a chance, and that was the main thing. We had a proper chance, and it proved right, so credit to Jermain.

‘Then all the rest of the deal was tough, there were so many things involved, but that is credit to the club.’
