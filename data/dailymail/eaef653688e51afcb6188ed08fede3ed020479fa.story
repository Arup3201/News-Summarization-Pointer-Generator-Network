Eden Hazard has scotched talk of a move to Paris Saint-Germain this summer - even though the French champions want Chelsea's main asset.

Laurent Blanc's side are ready to shell out £50million on David Luiz ahead of the World Cup and they have their sights set on the Belgian too, according to the Evening Standard.

Despite being handed punishment by UEFA for not co-operating with Financial Fair Play regulations, the manager hasn't exactly been shy in talking about Hazard in recent weeks.

Plain talking: Hazard said he is purely focused on being a success for Belgium at this summer's World Cup

Hazard tops the list as PSG make further moves to become a European powerhouse.

But that doesn't bother the player one iota.

'If you got to know me you’d know I’m not someone who is disturbed by it,' he said when asked about PSG. 

'Every year they say I’m everywhere. It’s part of the job. I focus on the World Cup which is much more important than what is said in the papers.'

Hazard will be a key figure for Marc Wilmots' side in Brazil - a further platform to show why he has been such a draw in the Premier League over the last year.

The 23-year-old was named the PFA Young Player of the Year towards the end of the season as his mesmeric invention almost dragged Jose Mourinho's Chelsea to the title.
