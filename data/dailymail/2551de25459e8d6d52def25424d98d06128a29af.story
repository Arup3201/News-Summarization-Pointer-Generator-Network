College football champion Jameis Winston and Florida State University may be sued by a woman accusing the star player of sexual assault.

The charges against the 20-year-old quarterback were dropped in December last year, however the woman’s attorney has said she intends to sue the school, the Tallahassee Police Department and the player himself.

The woman claims she was sexually assaulted by Mr Winston in December 2012, but following investigation by Leon County prosecutors, no action was taken.

Mr Winston's attorney said the sex was
 consensual but Patricia Carroll, representing the young woman, said her 
client, who was an FSU student at the time, was sexually assaulted.

The woman was 19 at the time and reported what she claimed happened to Tallahassee Police.

At
 a mid-December news conference, Ms Carroll criticized the way the 
police investigation was handled, saying that detectives failed to 
interview key witnesses, used unreliable and incomplete forensic tests 
and never tested the alleged victim's blood for the presence of 
date-rape drugs. Ms Carroll said that her client was ‘treated like a 
suspect.’

Tallahassee police
 have defended their handling of the case and Ms Carroll said she 
received a letter from the department that said an internal affairs 
investigation found that the case was handled with proper procedures.

Ms
 Carroll has also criticized police for not submitting her client's 
sexual assault kit to the Florida Department of Law Enforcement lab 
until January 17 last year - 39 days after it was taken. The attorney 
questioned whether evidence was properly preserved during those 39 days.

Champion: Just days after the charges were dropped, Mr Winston became the second freshman to win the Heisman trophy given to college football's most outstanding player

Ms
 Carroll says she asked Florida's attorney general, the state department
 of law enforcement and Governor Rick Scott for an independent 
examination into the rape investigation, claiming it was riddled with 
problems.

Scott ‘didn't even
 give us the courtesy of a response,’ Ms Carroll said Thursday, adding 
that in her letters to Florida officials, she mentioned the unrelated 
cases of two other FSU students who said they were raped, but were 
‘discouraged’ from going through with a prosecution. Ms Carroll said the
 family members of those two girls contacted her following her December 
news conference.

Mr Winston 
became the second freshman to win the Heisman trophy given to college 
football's most outstanding player. He joined Charlie Ward and Chris 
Weinke as the school's three Heisman winners.

He
 led Florida State to its first undefeated season and national 
championship since 1999 after setting national freshman records for 
yards passing and touchdown passes. The Seminoles defeated Auburn 34-31 
to capture the third national title in school history.

Ms
 Carroll said she plans to file a notice to sue the police department 
early next week. Under Florida law, anyone filing a lawsuit against a 
government agency must file court paperwork six months prior to the suit
 itself.
