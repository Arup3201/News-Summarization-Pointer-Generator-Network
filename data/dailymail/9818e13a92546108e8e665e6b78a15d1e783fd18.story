Rangers midielder Lewis Macleod has been given a first Scotland call-up by Gordon Strachan for the European Championship qualifier against Republic of Ireland and the friendly against England, both at Celtic Park.

The 20-year-old has been capped at every level from under-16s to under-21s and has impressed Strachan with his his performances for the Ibrox club in the Championship this season where he has so far scored seven goals.

Stoke City full-back Phil Bardsley has been recalled to the squad in the absence of the injured Allan Hutton while Sheffield Wednesday striker Stevie May retains his place and Celtic's Charlie Mulgrew returns from injury and suspension.
