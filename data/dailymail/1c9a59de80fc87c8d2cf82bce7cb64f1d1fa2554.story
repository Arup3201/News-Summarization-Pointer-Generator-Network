Walkers and holidaymakers were warned of a risk of landslides yesterday as the wet weather was forecast to continue into the new year.

With many areas already saturated, the prospect of more heavy showers means there may be further flooding in the next week.

The South-West of England remains the worst affected and forecasters have warned of 'dangerous conditions' in coastal areas.

In St Ives Cambridgeshire some residents awoke to find small boats in their back gardens after the Great Ouse burst its banks

The water levels were so deep home-owners were trapped indoors, with the only way out by boat

We're going to a need a bigger boat: Only those with barges and ships appear to be safe this Christmas, with seven inches of rain expected by Saturday

'We have had such heavy and persistent
rainfall over the past few days and weeks that there is a danger of 
landslides and rockfalls along the coast, even on coastal paths,' said a
Met Office spokesman.

Families heading out for a Christmas 
walk were urged to 'take  care' and warned: 'Do not get too close to the
cliff edge or walk under the cliff face along the beach and remember 
coastal paths could be impacted too.'

Many coastal paths in the South-West 
have been closed over the  past few weeks, and train services have also 
been disrupted by small coastal landslides. The latest warning was 
issued following advice from the British Geological Survey monitoring 
centre.

The worst hit areas of the South-West 
can expect up to two-and-a-half inches of rain by Saturday night. 
However, for the most part forecasters expect heavy showers rather than 
the prolonged downpours that have caused the worst of the recent 
flooding chaos. A Met Office spokesman said: 'There are going to be 
short bursts of showery rain followed by drier spells.

But walking seemed to be the only way to get around the village, which was one of many flooded across the region

'This unsettled pattern will continue all the way through to the New Year period.'

Yesterday afternoon there were  120 
flood warnings and 228 flood alerts still in place around the country, 
mainly across the South-West, Midlands and South-East.

Last night firemen were pumping two 
feet of flood water from an electricity sub-station which powers 40,000 
homes in the Reading area. It was not expected to be shut down.

Ice
warnings compound the festive freeze for the east coast of Scotland and
the Shetland, on what is on track to be the wettest year on record. And
in St Ives Cambridgeshire some residents awoke to find small boats in 
their back gardens after the Great Ouse burst its banks.

Forecasters said around 0.8ins 
(20mm) of rain is expected across the south-west of England and south 
Wales today, and the wet weather looks set to continue until the new 
year, with as much as three inches (80mm) falling in north-west 
England and north Wales on Saturday alone.

Flooding is set to worsen across parts of England and Wales, causing the 'dangerous conditions'.

Many
coastal paths have been closed over the last few weeks along the South 
West and train services have been disrupted by small coastal 
landslides.

But there's much more to come... A glorious start to Boxing Day in Peterborough, Cambridgeshire, as the sun rises in an amber sky
