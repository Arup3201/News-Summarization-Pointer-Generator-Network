A boy was left almost completely blind for the first five years of his life after bungling NHS staff failed to notice there was anything wrong with him - despite the fact he couldn’t see his bottle as a baby.

Billy Wells, now 12, suffered from a deteriorating eye-condition that 'robbed him of his childhood' after it went undiagnosed for five years.

Health workers that visited concerned parents Tracy, 43, and Charlie, 44, from High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire, were too busy to properly diagnose the youngster and repeatedly told them to 'stop being silly'.

Clear victory: Billy Wells, 12, and his father Charlie Wells. The boy has received a payout after he was left almost blind by NHS staff who failed to diagnose his eye condition

This was despite Billy seemingly being unable to see his milk bottle right next to him and as he grew older needed to sit one inch away from the TV to see it.

He would also sit quietly in the living room while his boisterous older brothers ran around and barely moved when left alone.

But alarm bells really started to ring for the couple when they returned from a trip to Disneyland Paris in 2005 and looked at their holiday pictures

They noticed that despite posing for over 200 photos - Billy hadn’t looked at the camera in any of them.

They then took him to an optician who diagnosed Billy with a deteriorating sight condition called hypermetropica amblyopia which had left him barely able to see.

After being fixed with a pair of life-changing glasses which considerably improved his vision Billy is thriving seven years on. 

Now Charlie and Tracy have been handed an undisclosed payout from Buckinghamshire Hospitals NHS Trust after they admitted liability for a 'breach of duty'.

The money will fund future occupational therapy, optical and physiotherapy costs and will be used to pay for extra tuition for Billy.

Today Mr Wells, a full-time carer for his son, told how they brought bigger and bigger TVs in an attempt to stop his son sitting so close to the screen.

He said: 'The health worker came to see him, she was rushed off her feet, she was trying to do the job of 55 people.

'So she missed it, she didn’t have time to properly look at Billy. We were always told there was nothing wrong, or we were being silly.

'I met her five years later and that report she wrote about him was still in the bottom of her briefcase, she just had been so rushed it got forgotten.

'It wasn’t until after we returned from a family holiday to Disneyland and we looked through our photographs, that we noticed that Billy wasn’t looking at the camera in any of the photos.

'When we asked him why he didn’t turn to look at the camera he said that he simply didn’t see where it was.

'He was sitting barely an inch from the screen of the TV, there was no way he could see anything.

'We were gradually buying bigger and bigger TVs to try and get him to sit further back, to the point we still have a 55 inch one.

'This all set alarms bells ringing and we immediately took him to the opticians for an examination.

'When we spoke to the optician about his results, the tests revealed his sight was very poor to the point where he could barely see anything at all.

'We were devastated and could not believe he had gone through so many years of his young life not being able to see properly. We just trusted the health workers like you do.

'When the optician put on that metal pair of glasses they do that they change the lenses in and he got to the point Billy could see, he refused to take them off.

'We had to wait for two hours while they made up our prescription with Billy wearing those glasses as he was so amazed.

'When we left he saw a pigeon for the first time, and he didn’t know what it was. He told me it was the most beautiful thing he had ever seen.

'I realised then he had never seen anything, I had to tell him what a leaf was.'

His father said: '(After visiting the optician) he saw a pigeon for the first time, and he didn¿t know what it was. He told me it was the most beautiful thing he had ever seen'

He added: 'Despite his delay at the start he is now top of his class, he loves reading and doing many things normal boys do.

'I am just so sad he lost those first few years of his life for no reason. I want people to know that the NHS should treat all children with respect.

'I asked Billy why he never told me about his sight, and he just said he thought that’s how they were meant to be.

'The payout will help with paying for the glasses and physiotherapy but really this is about the fact that we were right all along about our son.

'However, we hope improvements are made in training and resource to help medical staff recognise the symptoms of hypermetropica amblyopia and refer other patients for the appropriate tests and treatment.'

Fun: Billy can now play video games on the sofa with his brothers. Right, Billy his brother Danny at his cousin's wedding in Surrey in August 2013

Thanks to his glasses Billy can now read, write and spend his free time playing his favourite game Skyrim on his Xbox.

He said: 'I can play my favourite games on my Xbox now.

'The glasses have changed my life completely, I didn’t understand what seeing was, I just thought it was how it was meant to be.

'Now I love playing Skyrim and I can do that from the sofa with my brothers.'

Jenna Harris, a lawyer at Irwin Mitchell, who represented the family, said: 'Billy’s family has been left devastated because his early childhood was severely hampered by the delay to diagnose and treat him, despite the family raising their concerns repeatedly with health professionals.

'Billy requires a lot of intensive treatment to help assist his development. The settlement will provide Billy with vital funding to assist with his treatment and provide future financial support.

'We hope that lessons are learned by the Trust from Billy’s case and that all staff are adequately trained to ensure that children are given the appropriate tests to identify and treat health issues as quickly as possible.'

The money will fund future occupational therapy, optical and physiotherapy costs and will be used to pay for extra tuition for Billy
