Barack Obama's half-brother is making his film debut in a documentary where he talks about his non-existent relationship with his relative who is the most powerful man in the world.

George Obama, 30, lives in Nairobi, Kenya and first came into the public eye in 2008 when his half-brother was a rising presidential candidate.

At the time, he was living in a hut in the slum neighborhood of Haruma, which prompted many critics to deride Barack for not providing financial support.

Opening up: A clip from a documentary that features George Obama, left, the President's half-brother, was released Tuesday

In his interview with conservative journalist Dinesh D'Souza, who based the documentary off his book, The Roots of Obama's Rage which focuses largely on the President's views on colonialism, George Obama keeps his comments about his famous relative fairly positive.

In a clip released to The Hollywood Reporter, Mr D'Souza asked whether he felt dejected that Barack has never offered to help George, but he simply brushed such claims aside.

'I think he has a family of his own, he's supposed to help his family,' George responded.

The journalist didn't let go, saying that they are blood relatives which should entitle him to be considered a part of Barack Obama's family, but George still didn't take the bait.

Familial similarities: Though they had different mothers, there are a number of physical similarities between Barack (left) and George (right)

Searching for answers: In 2008, George Obama was interviewed about his relationship- or lack thereof- with his half-brother Barack and he is seen here reading the then-Senator's book about his Kenyan roots

'Yea, I'm part of his family, but I'm over-age so I can help myself.

'He’s got other issues to deal with. He’s taking care of the world, so he’s taking care of me.'

George says that when he was five or six years old, he met Barack briefly.

'I was just surprised- he is some half white guy,' George said in a clip from the documentary. 

Barack was born in Hawaii by his mother Ann Dunham, who was white with various European ancestry.

The two men share the common bond of their father, Barack Obama Sr, but even that was not very strong because of their age gap.

Barack is 50-years-old while George 
is only 30-years-old, and Barack Sr died in a car accident just six 
months after George was born.

Back to his roots: While he was a senator from Illinois in 2006, Obama visited Nairobi, Kenya

The
President reportedly has seven half-siblings on his father's side- 
including George, though the paternity of two of his reported 
half-brothers, named Abo and Bernard, is questioned.

While President Obama hasn't spoken 
for years about his trip to Kenya as a child, he did write about it in 
his book Dreams For My Father.

Thinking back: George Obama said that he was about five or six years old when he met Barack, remembering that he was 'surprised' because his half-brother was 'some half white guy'

In the book, he wrote that meeting 
George was a 'painful affair' that was 'hastily arranged' with the help 
of Barack's half-sister Auma.

Towards the end of the book which 
describes a young Barack's trip to Kenya to connect with his extended 
family, he tells the story about how he and Auma drove to the school 
where George was at school and had his teacher pull him aside during 
recess.

'He was a handsome, roundheaded boy with a wary gaze,' he wrote.

'The boy shook our hands bravely but kept glancing back at games he'd just left. I realized then that we'd made a mistake.

'I took comfort in the fact that 
perhaps one day, when he was older, George, too, might want to know who 
his father had been, and who his brothers and sisters were, and that if 
he ever came to me I would be there for him, to tell him the story I 
knew.'

In a 2008 interview 
while then-Senator Obama was rising through the Democratic presidential 
primaries, George said that he ended up taking Barack's prescient advice
without knowing it.

'I
think I wanted to learn about my father the same way he did,' George 
Obama told a CNN reporter about his decision to read his half-brother's 
book.

Happy: Though an initial report said that George was living on less than $1 per day, he has since rebuked those statements and said that though he lives in a slum, he is happy and has had a good life

Different lives: There is a 20-year age difference between George and Barack Obama, as well as a vast distance between their homes as Barack has moved between Hawaii, the Philippines, New York, Chicago and D.C. while George lives in Kenya

'He came here searching for his roots, and I was also trying to find my roots.'

In the documentary interview, George said that he remembers little about his father except the stories that his mother told him.

'He was really educated,' George said of his deceased father.

'My mom was disappointed in me because I actually didn't finish my schooling. I really did let her down, I let my father down because he was an intellectual guy.'

That said, George did write a book, entitled Homeland, which was published in 2010.

While many conservatives- including the interviewer- were likely hoping for a more controversial and damning take on his half-brother, George seems to be one of the least problematic members of the wide-ranging Obama family.

By comparison, Mr Obama's 'lost' half-uncle Omar Onyango was arrested for driving under the influence which was coupled with an outstanding deportation warrant.
