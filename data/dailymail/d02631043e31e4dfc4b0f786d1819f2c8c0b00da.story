A unique collection of 350 handcrafted model planes has been unveiled for the first time, revealing the bizarre pre-First World War designs that led the way during the first years of flight.

The stunning aircraft were built over a 50-year period by an anonymous and 'reclusive' elderly man who has now decided to put them on sale through Gloucestershire auction house Dominic Winter.

The collection features aircraft from 15 countries built on a scale of just 1:72, with the resulting models thought to include the vast almost all of the planes that became airborne before 1914.

A Kowalaskiego biplane from 1910. The incredibly intricate models, some with parts as fine as a human hair, were all made by the same craftsman over the course of 50 years

A Sikorsky Russky Vitas biplane from 1913. The collection includes virtually every plane built before World War One

The collection includes aircraft from Austria, Czechoslovakia, Switzerland, Holland, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, New Zealand, Poland, Slovenia, Romania, Russian and Great Britain.

Gloucestershire auction house Dominic Winter will be auctioning the aircraft on Thursday May 15, and is expecting them to fetch more than £27,000 when they go under the hammer.

Sadly the collection is likely to be broken up as many of the planes are being sold in singularly or in small groups over an approximate 150 lots.

Chris Albury, who will be auctioning off the aircraft, described the collection as 'absolutely extraordinary'.

'I’ve never seen so many built to such a small scale. The attention to detail is amazing... The owner, who is very reclusive, spent several decades making them and there isn’t anyone in his family who wants to house them,' he said.

'It is hard to believe that one person has managed to make all of them. He set himself the task of making them at 1:72 and he has stuck to it...Whether it is the wing or the wheel or the cockpit, it is all to scale,' he added.

'He has been making them for decades and it is a hobby which really took over once he retired... They are so skilled and the aircraft are very unusual.

A cooley monoplane from 1910.  Of themodel's intricacy, Mr Albury added: 'It is quite overwhelming when you see them. The closer you look, the further your jaw drops'

He added: 'He couldn't have made one in less than a week. They are completely handcrafted and very fragile.' Pictured is a Piggot Bros No1 biplane from 1910

It must have been very difficult to get the plans to make some of them,' Mr Albury went on to say.
