No, these photographs aren't blurry. And don't worry, your eyes are just fine.

The fuzzy images are actually the latest hi-tech gimmick from a British plus-size women's fashion and lifestyle magazine: they are shot in 3D.

The cover of SLiNK's seventh issue features a 3D photograph of gorgeous Australian model Bree Warren, a UK size 14, which is the minimum requirement for all models featured in the publication.

The cover of SLiNK magazin's seventh issue is 3D and comes with free 3D glasses so you can see more of model Bree Warren than ever before.

The cover shows Warren - who works for Models 1+ and has just finished 
her journalism degree - wearing a furry Marimodo gilet, a body from ASOS Curve, and cuff and rings by Imogen.

Inside the magazine is further 3D editorial, with photographs of Warren modelling a selection of clothes and accessories from both high street brands and independent high-end designers.

Readers can fully appreciate the photos - all of which are taken by Roberto Aguilar - by wearing the free 3D glasses provided with the edition.

The theme of the edition is Freedom, exploring everything from the change in a woman's freedom after she has children, to how the changes in the Middle East have affected women in the region.

Bree Warren wears a jacket by Dea London and jewellery by Imogen.

The editor of SLiNK, Rivkie Baum (a size 16-18 26-year-old), said the 3D technique was employed 'to create a sensational selection of images with a military theme that truly come to life'.

She added: 'The issue is The Freedom Issue and as our
lead story we wanted something fierce and fresh with a military spin.

'We worked with a lot of mainstream PR agencies for this shoot, 
especially with young designers whose samples would work for both a girl of 
size 14 and a straight size model.

'We find emerging designers are keen to work with models of various sizes. We wanted this 
shoot to really be about pushing boundaries of what 'plus size' 
modelling and fashion should be about.'

Warren models a Jeffrey Michael Design bodice, an Imogen Belfield necklace and New Look leggings.

As well as the 3D shoot the edition also features a beauty section, shopping pages and extra
editorial shoots, including a beautiful lingerie shoot.

SLiNK, which won the award for Best Plus Size Magazine 2011 at the 100% People Awards, was founded 'to show that plus-size models can do anything a straight size model can'.

The fashion inside can always be found up to a size 22, often a 32.

The concept for the publication was Baum's, a graduate from the London College of Fashion in Design and Pattern Cutting and a creative at Models 1.

Her aim was to promote healthy lifestyle, body confidence and body acceptance to the 4.9 million women in the UK who wear a size 18+.

Warren wears a coat by Marina Rinaldi, a dress by Francesca Marotta and a head piece by Loren Wood.

Working the military look, Warren sports a Peek-a-boo Vintage top, a Lulu Liu furry gilet, Imogen Belfield rings and New Look leggings.

Baum said: 'SLiNK is a shining light in a world that frowns on plus size 
women.

'Using models who are a size 14+, SLiNK's 
ethos is to show their readers that being fuller-figured is no barrier 
to obtaining both an on-trend wardrobe and a fabulous lifestyle.'

The magazine has run online for one year and is now available to purchase via the company's website. Print copies cost £3.95 and digital downloads £2.

For the SLiNK shoot, editor Rivkie Baum was stylist, the model's make-up was done by Lauren Baker and her hair by Enzo at HMS Creative.
