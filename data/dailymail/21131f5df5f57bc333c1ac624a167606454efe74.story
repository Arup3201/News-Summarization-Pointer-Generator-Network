A mother-of-five relived her terror as she hid just feet from the Kenyan mall terrorists, with nothing more than a flimsy table to shield her young daughters.

Katherine Walton, an American who lives in Kenya, had been shopping with her five children at the Westgate Mall in Nairobi on September 21 when shooting erupted.

Mrs Walton scrambled to hide under a flimsy table with her three daughters - four-year-old Portia, Gigi, two, and baby Petra as the terrorists stalked the main floor, just feet from they were poorly hidden.

Katherine Walton recalls her horrifying ordeal when she was forced to shield her three young daughters under a flimsy table during a terrorist attack on the Westgate mall in Nairobi, Kenya on September 21

Mrs Walton told NBC's Dateline tonight: 'I think the first thought was, ''I really 
can't believe this is happening.''

'And then it was, you know, just 
instinct to grab the girls and run. … A Kenyan woman came and scooped up
 Portia.  And we both ran right behind this - display table.'

The frantic mother's next thought was for her two sons who had wandered off to do their own shopping elsewhere in the mall.

She called them to tell them not to come out of the store and hide. Teenager Blaise Walton told Dateline 
that he had been at the cash register with his younger brother, ten-year-old Ian, 
when they realized that something dreadful was happening.

Blaise said: 'Everyone looked to the main entrance and then people go flying through the air.'

The boys ran to a store room where they arranged bags of flour around them and pulled stacks of toilet paper rolls over their heads.

His younger brother, ten-year-old Ian, added: 'All my brother and I did was just pray for our family and laid there.'

Portia Walton, five, ran to Mr Abdul Haji from where she had been hiding from terrorists with her mother Katherine and sisters. Her mother can be seen crouching behind a table in the rear of the picture

Mrs Walton meanwhile was trapped on the main floor of the mall where al-Shabaab terrorists were stalking with large weapons, looking for victims to shoot dead.

The mother recalled: 'I saw them.  I saw two whole men. … They
 were talking very slow, and as I've thought about it, they almost had a
 demeanor like they owned the place. They looked my direction. … It was
 pretty terrifying.'

Mrs Walton calmed her daughters by rubbing their backs and making soothing noises as they stayed frozen in place for four and a half hours.

Finally, there was a glimmer of hope. The Kenyan woman turned to Mrs Walton and said: 'The cops are here.'

However it wasn't the police - but a Good Samaritan volunteer Abdul Haji. The businessman had been having a meeting nearby when he heard about the Westgate attack and ran to help his brother, an undercover agent for the Kenyan intelligence service - bringing his own handgun.

He saw the women cowering with the little girls, saying that Mrs Walton 'looked very scared'.

With a few words he planned an exit strategy with Mrs Walton but then her five-year-old Portia burst out of their hiding place and went running towards Mr Haji.

Mrs Walton said of her daughter: 'She's typically kind of cautious, maybe a little bit anxious and - not one just to get up and run … I think she saw the hope.'

The image of the brave five-year-old running across the mall became one of the most poignant of the massacre where at least 67 people died.

Luckily for the family, the Walton sons were also rescued from their storeroom hiding place after around four hours.

For husband and father Phillip Walton, 39, who was in North Carolina on a business trip at the time, it was an incredibly harrowing time. 

He told the Today show: 'I was trying to follow news reports as they came in.I had a close friend who was keeping me updated via Facebook.

'You just feel very helpless when you’re 9,000 miles away and you know that your entire family is going through something like this.'
