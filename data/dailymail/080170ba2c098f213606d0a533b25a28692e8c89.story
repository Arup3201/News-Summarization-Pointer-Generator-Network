Shot: Supporters of Jeremy Hill say he was 'protecting his children' when he shot the bear which had wandered on to his property (file picture)

Dozens of supporters have turned out in court to show their outrage after a man was charged with killing a grizzly bear which had wandered into his back yard where his children were playing.

Jeremy Hill has been charged with unlawfully taking a federally protected species after allegedly shooting the bear when it ambled on to his rural home in Porthill, Idaho, near the Canadian border.

Supporters of the father-of-six say Mr Hill, 33, was doing nothing more than 'protecting his children' when the bear, accompanied by two other bears, wandered on to his property on May 8.

It is thought the bear was shot with a bolt-action rifle after approaching an enclosure where Mr Hill's children had been raising pigs.

At a hearing in the U.S. District Court in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho, the crowd was so big that the magistrate judge had to move the case to another courtroom.

A jury trial has been set for Oct. 4. If convicted, Hill could face penalties of up to one year in prison and fines up to $50,000.

Following the hearing, Mr Hill's father, Mike Hill, told CDAPress.com, 'This whole thing is a waste of taxpayer money.'

Mr Hill Snr said at least five of his son's six children were at home when the three bears approached his property.

The Endangered Species Act classifies the grizzly bear as a threatened species in the lower 48 states, and it is protected by federal law.

Hill and his wife have six children, and their home is between two federal grizzly bear recovery zones - the Selkirk zone to the west and Cabinet-Yaak zone to the east.

Biologists estimate that 100 grizzlies inhabit the zones that include parts of Idaho, British Columbia and Montana.
