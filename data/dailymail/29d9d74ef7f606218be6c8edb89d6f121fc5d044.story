Suspect: Police say Kurt Meyers, 64, fatally shot four people on Wednesday

A gunman is on the run in upstate New York after shooting at least six people and killing four in a violent spree Wednesday morning across two towns in Herkimer County.

Police are still searching for the suspect, 64-year-old Kurt R. Meyers, whom they believe is hiding out in the tiny village of Herkimer.

As the manhunt continued into the afternoon, a half dozen gunshots rang out around 1:30 p.m. near a shuttered storefront downtown, while nearby, law 
enforcement officials and New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo were planning to hold a news 
conference.

It was not immediately clear who 
had fired the shots, whether it was police or possibly Meyers.

Meyers is suspected of shooting four people and killing two at John's Barber Shop in Mohawk Wednesday morning and then fatally shooting two others about a mile away at Gaffey's Fast Lube and Car Wash in the village of Herkimer.

Officials suspect Meyers also ignited a fire that broke out at his apartment building at 32 South Washington St.  in Mohawk shortly before the shootings.

Officers raided his apartment around 11 a.m. and found half a dozen guns and ammunition, according to the Utica Observer-Dispatch.

The newspaper also reported that the gunman may have worked at the car wash where two people were killed.

'We saw a 
gunman walking around the shop,' one woman who was at the car wash told 
WKTV. She said she saw two people who were shot on the 
ground.

'Then he took off in a Jeep Wrangler,' she said of the shooter, adding, 'There were empty rifle shells on the ground.'

The shootings prompted officials to put 
schools on lockdown in Herkimer and Mohawk, as well in as the nearby 
municipalities of Ilion, Frankfort, Little Falls, Richfield Springs, 
Dolgeville, West Winfield, Bridgewater and Newport, said Mark Vivacqua, 
the Herkimer school superintendent.

Harry Montgomery Sr. of Mohawk was among the victims who were shot and killed at Johnâ€™s Barber Shop.

Montgomery, who is in his late 60s, was visiting the shop for a haircut, according to his son. The other victims haven't yet been identified.

'My sister was
at the bank, cashing a check when she heard all the commotion,' 
Montgomery told the Observer-Dispatch. 'She came out to see what was 
going on and found out it was Dad who got shot.'

Meyers is described as about 5-foot-11 with white hair and a white beard. He was last seen wearing a flannel shirt.

Michele Mlinar, who works as a bartender at Cangees Bar and Grill in Herkimer, said Meyers had been a regular customer of hers for about 10 years.

'When I saw his picture, I just got sick to my stomach,' she told the Observer-Dispatch. 'It could have been here. It could have been us.'

She said he wasn't a 'people person' and 'he would never talk to anyone else' when he visited the bar. He would usually visit the bar on Fridays and Saturdays and drink two Coors and listen to live music, she added.

She also noted that he was kind to the staff, but seemed 'very jittery and nervous.'
