A 911 dispatcher laughed when told a man with mental health problems may have stabbed his girlfriend to death - and then passed on inaccurate information to police officers.

The woman found it hysterical when told that Ronald Friedfertig's psychiatrist reported his client was unsure whether he imagined stabbing Yvonne Geffner or if it really happened.

After receiving the report, the dispatcher, who is not identified, said it was 'crazy'.

Investigation: A 911 dispatcher laughed when told a man with mental health problems may have stabbed his girlfriend to death - and then passed on inaccurate information to police officers. This is a file picture

A recording of the conversation, obtained by the New York Post, reveals that the operator laughed: 'This man said that he had a dream that — I can’t even talk right now.'

She allegedly went on to give police officers the wrong information - saying no assault had taken place and mixed up the suspect and the victim.

Police officers were also allegedly not told that the emergency call was made by Friedfertig's psychiatrist and that nobody had seen the woman for a week.

Instead, when they visited the Brooklyn home, which was hiding the rotting body of Miss Geffner, they simply knocked and left when nobody answered.

It was only four days after the 911 call was made on May 30 that the body of Miss Geffner was found after neighbours reported
a smell coming from the home.

Friedfertig was arrested on Wednesday for allegedly stabbing Miss Geffner to death in their Midwood apartment.

Probe: Police officers in New York, pictured, are now investigating the alleged mistakes by the dispatcher

The delay in getting to Miss Geffner's body has left police officers furious and keen to find out what went wrong.

A law-enforcement source, speaking to the New York Post, said:  '[The call center] got a call for a person possibly stabbed inside a home. The door should have been taken down.'

The suspected killer had first told his brother that he had a vision of stabbing his girlfriend. The brother then passed this information to psychiatrist Noam Koenigsberg who called 911.

The operator he spoke to dealt with it professionally and passed it on to the dispatcher, who is now under investigation.

When police eventually found the body, Friedfertig was in a mental hospital after throwing himself in front of a train.

He is now awaiting arraignment on murder charges and is recovering from injuries in hospital .

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
