It is probably not what the driver had in mind when he forked out £230,000 for one of the most luxurious rides going.

But today an unknown motorist discovered that his white Ferrari FF has been written off after a dramatic-looking crash in which, thankfully, nobody was hurt.

The person behind the wheel lost control of the performance car and smashed it into a tree, damaging it beyond repair.

Write-off: The £230,000 white Ferrari FF was seen wrecked at the side of the road

Wreckage: A passing motorist pictured the totalled vehicle, which the driver had lost control of

Repairs: Rescue crew tinkered with the damaged car before it became clear it was unsalvageable

Impact came after the care came off the road, shooting 20 yards up a grassy embankment before being stopped in its tracks by a tree.

The crash made a mangled wreck of the 208mph, 651bhp vehicle, which was photographed by passing drivers on the southbound carriageway of the A56 in Lancashire.

Wayne Freeman, of Haslingden, said: 'My friend called me up to say there had been a bad crash on the road involving a really nice Ferrari.

'I drove there myself to have a look and it was a complete write off. It's such a beautiful car and I'm sure the owner's absolutely devastated.

'But the main thing is that he's OK. A car can be replaced at the end of the day although it's going to cost quite an amount to replace that.'

Police confirmed that the 6.2-litre car, which boasts a leather interior and TV screens for rear passengers, was the only vehicle involved in the accident.

A spokesperson for Lancashire Police said: 'There will be no further involvement from the police.'

When the Ferrari FF was launched in 2011, motoring editor RAY MASSEY took one for a spin. Here's what he had to say...

Ferrari has really put the boot in with this shooting brakestyle, four-wheel drive supercar. Designed by legendary Italian styling house Pininfarina, it aims for practicality with power.

The new FF is a sexier, faster, replacement for the 612 Scaglietti Gran Turismo and combines style with massive on-road presence.

It's Ferrari's first production four-wheel drive, sending power to the front wheels as well as the back if the rear wheels can't transmit all the power the driver is demanding.

Ferrari says it'll take four people plus luggage with 450 litres of boot space - slightly less than a Ford Focus estate.

It bears more than a passing resemblance to British classics of the Seventies - the Jensen Interceptor and Reliant Scimitar. Expect Aston Martin, and maybe Bentley, to follow suit.

The FF boasts colossal performance with 0-62mph in 3.7 neckwrenching seconds and 0-to-124mph in 11 seconds using the computer-operated launch control.

With a top speed of 208mph, it's totally relaxed cruising at motorway speeds, as the fabulous sound from the V12 engine is directed into the cabin.

Despite an enormous 651bhp  from its 6.2 litre engine, it's easy to drive. Its seven-speed F1 dual clutch gearbox can even be left in automatic if you feel lazy.

In terms of pure aesthetics, the styling is rather ungainly from some angles. But would I care? Nah.
