A man has been found guilty of murdering his girlfriend's three-year daughter because he was jealous that she was getting more attention than him.

Lylah Aaron suffered a fatal brain injury and three broken ribs after she was kicked, slapped, shaken and punched in the head by Delroy Catwell.

Catwell had denied killing Lylah and blamed her injuries on the girl's mother Precious Chibanda.

But a jury at Sheffield Crown Court found him guilty of murder today after a two week trial. He will be sentenced tomorrow.

Ms Chibanda, who found it too upsetting to attend much of the trial, broke down in tears as the verdict was read out.

The court had heard from medical experts that the force used to break Lylah's ribs was similar to that seen in a car crash or a fall from a tall building.

As well as a 'sustained and forceful attack' on Lylah hours before she died, the jury was told that Catwell also slammed the tot’s head 
against a bedroom wall damaging the plaster three weeks previously - 
claiming he hit the wall because he was trying to kill a spider.

Seven months before she died, Lylah was found with a bruised neck which 
Catwell said was caused when she banged her head on a sink.

Paramedics were called on February 8 when Ms Chibanda found Lylah was not 
breathing when she returned from work at Derby Royal Infirmary.

She asked
Catwell to help but he did not respond. She said: 'He looked like he 
was in shock. He was just frozen.'

Paramedics
discovered Lylah’s body was rigid and attempted resuscitation. She was 
rushed to Sheffield Children’s Hosptal but later died.

Prosecutor Bryan Cox QC said: 'There
were numerous bruises over her body.

'There was 
substantial bruising to her head and fractures to her ribs.

'The injuries
indicated she had been subject to a sustained and forceful assault that
had occurred within hours of her admission to hospital.'

Mr Cox had told the court: 'The couple’s relationship was generally good but sometimes he would complain he felt sidelined and she gave too much to Lylah.'

'This murder was a forceful and 
sustained attack on a defenceless three-year-old girl.'

Det Supt David Barraclough

Catwell, an unemployed DJ, told police the girl was full of energy and he found it hard to deal with her demands while trainee nurse Miss Chibanda said 'he at times mentioned that I perhaps smothered her.'

Lylah’s mother had gone to work on the day her daughter died but Catwell failed to take Lylah to nursery where staff described her as 'bright' and a 'confident, bubbly little girl'.

He claimed the girl was tired and had been ill for a few days so after watching cartoons he put her to bed that afternoon. He told police: 'I have never hit Lylah. I didn’t cause any injuries whatsoever.'

Experts said he must have inflicted the fatal injuries before Miss Chibanda returned from work at about 4.30pm.

A pathologist reported that the bruises to Lylah’s head were 'typical of non-accidental injuries' and bruising in and behind the left ear 'suggested impact from a hard object with a straight linear surface.'

He went on: 'Other bruises could have been caused by kicks, slaps or punches.'

All the bruises had been caused within 24 hours of her death.

Medical experts found scar tissue on the brain indicating a three-week-old injury and four rib fractures, one of which was about three weeks old.

The other three fresh breaks had been caused by 'squeezing or compression'.

The medics concluded Lylah died from repeated impacts causing fatal bleeding to the brain.

The court was told that Catwell had a previous conviction for sexual assault against a 13-year-old girl in August, 2005

Andrew Robertson QC, defending, said the attack on Lylah was not pre-meditated and although he admitted there were as number of impacts the court could 'never be sure in this case that there was an intention to kill.'

Judge Justice Nicola Davies, heard pre-sentence submissions from both barristers who agreed that Catwell will receive a life sentence with a minimum term to be fixed by the judge.

Both lawyers also agreed the judge's starting point for fixing the minimum term was 15 years but she could increase this by taking into account aggravating factors.

Mr Cox said these factors should include the vulnerability of the victim, the abuse of a position of trust, the previous violence towards Lylah, the fact he tried to blame his partner for the murder and his previous conviction.

After the verdict investigating officer 
Det Supt David Barraclough said: 'This murder was a forceful and 
sustained attack on a defenceless three-year-old girl.

'It was both 
deliberate and violent and perpetrated by Catwell the man who should 
have been caring for her.

'It is clear his vicious acts left Lylah with 
injuries that later were to prove fatal.'
