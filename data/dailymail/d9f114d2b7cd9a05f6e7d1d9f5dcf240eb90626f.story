The MoD today recovered two 2ft-long unexploded bombs which were seen being casually carried along by two men who found them washed up on a beach.

The pair were pictured with the two potentially deadly rusty 120mm tank shells slung over the shoulders.

Onlookers watched as the men strolled past them with the explosives that date back to the Cold War.

Shell-shocked! The walkers were photographed taking the tank shells away from a Dorset beauty spot

It is believed the unidentified pair may have seized the bombs to try and later cash in as scrap metal.

The MoD confirmed today following an urgent appeal that the shells had been 'swiftly recovered'.

The shells were found washed up at Warbarrow Bay, Dorset.  The area is part of the 7,000-acre Lulworth Military Range used by the Army for tank firing practice.

A woman who took the picture of the pair on her mobile phone, said: 'I thought they were carrying rugs at first but as they walked past I saw they were enormous shells.

'I was with somebody who used to be in the Army and he said that because their ends were intact, they were unexploded.

'I was really scared. As they were walking past, my little girl was alongside them.

A spokesman for the Ministry of Defence said the shells would have probably been fired from a Chieftain tank

Despite the copious signs about the military firing range, the pair risked death by taking the shells

'I just think they're a pair of idiots.'

Another person said: 'What a couple of twits. If you see anything like this you should always call the police, not cart it on home.'

A member of the public posted on a local internet message board that the men were candidates for the Darwin Awards, a tongue-in-cheek term for people who take themselves out of the gene pool via death.

However, another poster commented: 'What's the problem? One man's scrap is another's treasure.'

A spokesman for the Ministry of Defence said the shells would have probably been fired from a Chieftain tank or a Wombat anti-tank rifle used by the Army in the 70s and 80s.

The MoD confirmed today following an urgent appeal that the shells had been 'swiftly recovered'

He said: 'These shells have swiftly been recovered and we would like to urge the public using the ranges to keep to the designated pathways and remember that it is potentially extremely dangerous to touch any military material they may find.

‘We take the safety of the public extremely seriously and all pathways at Lulworth Ranges that are open to the public are cleared of military debris, including shells, before access is permitted.

‘A number of signs have been placed on-site warning members of the public of the dangers of venturing from authorised pathways and removing shells. Unfortunately there are instances where these warnings are ignored.’

The spokesman confirmed there have been no charges against anyone involved, but added: ‘They are being spoken to by the Ministry of Defence police.’
