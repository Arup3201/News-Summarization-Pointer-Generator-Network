The Anfield redevelopment project reached another milestone on Thursday after the demolition of the final two houses on one side of the ground.

The buildings in Lothair Road, situated behind the main stand of Liverpool's 46,000 capacity ground, were brought down by bulldozers to mark the completion of another phase of the project.

Liverpool City Council, in conjunction with the football club, aim to redevelop and regenerate the community around Anfield by mid-2016. The £260 million project aims to create refurbished or new housing, a multi-use park space and greater numbers of commercial and retail premises.

Crucial to the project is the expansion of the stadium, which will see Liverpool play in front of almost 60,000 fans from the start of the 2016-17 season.

The development remains controversial, even if it has received the endorsement of the vast majority of residents and officials. Some residents remain uncertain as to what benefit they will get from the project and are disappointed by the lack of communication they have received from the council throughout the demolition process.

The future: Liverpool's plans for Anfield will see the capacity grow to almost 60,000

Expansion: The main stand will house an extra 8,500 seats and the Anfield Road stand will take another 4,800

Margaret Sheilds, speaking to the Liverpool Echo earlier this year, claimed she has been 'left in limbo' by the council. She feels that 'everything is to suit the Anfield stadium and Liverpool FC,' as opposed to the future of the surrounding community and its residents.

Indeed in May Liverpool City Council had to consider seeking compulsory purchase powers in order to acquire the final few properties owned by those less keen to sell up.

On the other hand many see this latest demolition phase as another step forward in an exciting project, with one property owner in the area told the Echo 'people are happy again,' since the commencement of the redevelopment work.

Moving on up: Liverpool finished second in the Premier League and will hope to continue that success

The football club will benefit from a greatly increased capacity. Brendan Rodgers led the Reds to Champions League football last season, with the team narrowly missing out on winning a first league title since 1990. The Reds boss will be relishing the possibility of European nights in front of an additional 15,000 supporters after the completion of the project.

The fact that the club are remaining at Anfield, rather than finding somewhere to build a new stadium is also seen as a significant benefit of the upheaval in the area. Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard believes the club’s rich history will be consolidated within an improved Anfield. He said in 2012: 'A lot of history and important things have happened at Anfield and I think it is fantastic Liverpool are staying there.'
