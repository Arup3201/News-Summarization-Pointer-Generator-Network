Several participants in the Carnival parade in the Dominican Republic marched wearing Ku Klux Klan outfits - and the island nation's Ministry of Culture has come out in defense of the outfits following an outpouring of criticism.

The culture ministry is tasked with approving groups that are permitted to march in the annual parade, so when a group showed up wearing Klan outfits - which represent hate, fear and oppression against African Americans in the Southern United States - people expressed their outrage.

In a series of post on Twitter on Monday, the ministry defended the group's attire by explaining that it was for a portion of the parade dedicated to commemorating historical events.

'Every group is free to choose their themes, whether using elements of the Dominican identity or universal culture in their costumes,' the ministry tweeted.

Another tweet noted that the Dominican Republic is a 'free country' where people are at liberty 'to express their creativity.'

The controversy was first reported by El Caribe.

In a followup statement, the ministry claimed that the costumes were intended to be critical of the KKK in the U.S., which has a history of violence against blacks, and still exists - albeit in a much smaller capacity than in the past - today.

Not everyone was convinced, and many took to social media to voice their disdain.

'If the point was to demonstrate the obscurantism of a historical period, the message didnâ€™t come through!' write Twitter user Nieves Peguero. 

The Latino Rebels blog caught wind of the story after it gained traction in the Dominican media on Monday.

The bloggers were equally outraged.

'If the KKK procession was meant to be humorous or satirical, it obviously failed,' Iris Estrada wrote, as initially reported by the Huffington Post.

The Dominican Republic is no stranger to controversial racial issues.

Last year, the Supreme Court issued a ruling that eliminated the birthright citizenship to be applied retroactively. This ultimately jeopardized the immigration statuses of thousands of Haitian immigrants and their Dominican-born children, the majority of which are black.

According to the Huffington Post, human rights groups estimate that the ruling could strip more than 200,000 people of their citizenship.

The Dominican government says those estimates are too high.
