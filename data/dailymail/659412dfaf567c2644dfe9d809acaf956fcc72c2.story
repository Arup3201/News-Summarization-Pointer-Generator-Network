Manchester United stars including Robin van Persie, Angel Di Maria and Juan Mata brought some Christmas cheer to young patients at Royal Manchester Children's Hospital by paying them a visit.

The trio were joined by fellow Old Trafford team-mates such as Ander Herrera, Phil Jones, David de Gea and Marcos Rojo as they met the children before presenting them with gifts.

The young patients were beaming with smiles as they met some of their heroes, a heart-warming moment that also touched the players.

'This is unbelievable. All the people that are working here and helping these people to get through their bad moments is something that I will always respect,' said Mata.

The festive visit to the hospital was the Spain international's first and like the playmaker, fellow midfielder Herrera was equally humbled by his time with the kids. 

'If we can make the children smile, then I'm very happy. It's a pleasure for me to be here and I wish that they can have a good Christmas,' added the 25-year-old. 

Defender Jones echoed the duo's sentiments - adding that the sobering visit provided a reality check for Louis van Gaal's squad. 

'It's a reality check for probably most of us. It's not nice to see the kids like this especially over Christmas. Hopefully the presents and toys will give them something to smile about,' said Jones.

United's next excursion on-the-pitch is a Premier League home clash against Newcastle. The Red Devils know victory will aid their top four credentials and put a smile once more on the face of the patients at Royal Manchester Children's Hospital.
