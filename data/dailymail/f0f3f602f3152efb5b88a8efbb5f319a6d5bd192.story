Newport Gwent Dragons claimed just their second away win over Cardiff since the start of regional rugby at a packed Arms Park.

Two tries from line-out drives brought them their fourth victory on the trot in all competitions, although a final-quarter rally did earn the hosts a losing bonus point.

Both Dragons tries came from Elliott Dee, who played only because No1 hooker Rhys Thomas suffered a groin injury in the warm-up. 

Newport's Tom Prydie kicked 13 points while Elliott Dee scored two tries in their win over Cardiff

In the end, though, the place kicking of 13-point Dragons full-back Tom Prydie that proved the difference. 

Dragons captain Rynard Landman said: ‘The boys showed real guts out there. We haven’t won here for a long time. 

'I’m very proud of the boys for believing in themselves. We can start building momentum now with four wins in a row. Games like this are why we play the game.’
