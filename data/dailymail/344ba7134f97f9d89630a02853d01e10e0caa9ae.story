These are the horrific injuries sustained by a Good Samaritan when he was stabbed 11 times with broken beer bottles.

Anthony Jukes, 25, needed more than 100 stitches after he was attacked in a country park in July. 

Following the assault, he said he could 'see my insides' and was 'holding my rib cage and stomach' to stem the bleeding. 

Violent thug Robert Barone, 40, was sentenced to eight years in prison this week for the sickening attack.

Mr Jukes, from Meir in Stoke, needed more than 100 stitches after he was attacked in a country park in July

Sentencing at Chester Crown Court, Judge Roger Dutton said: 'Mr Jukes was lucky he didn't bleed to death because the extent of his injuries are just awful.

'(They were) bad enough at the time but the outcome many months later is not much better.

'He will be living with this experience for the rest of his life.'

A court heard the 25-year-old truck driver only had his life saved by an off-duty paramedic who was walking past at the time. 

Mr Jukes was walking through Astbury Mere Country Park, in Congleton, Staffordshire, when a fight broke out between a friend and another group. 

As he tried to intervene, he was slashed by Barone who had smashed two beer bottles together. 

He suffered shocking injuries to his face, chest and arms and was taken to hospital where he underwent emergency surgery.

The truck driver said: 'I never thought in a million years that something like this would happen to me' 

Previously describing the savage attack, Mr Jukes said: 'I looked down and could see my insides. I said to myself, "just keep calm, keep calm".

'I was holding my rib cage and stomach because I didn't want all the blood to come out.

'I kept as calm as I could because if you are stressed, your blood pressure goes up.

'At the hospital they said I was very lucky. If there hadn't been an off-duty paramedic there, this could have been a very different situation.

'I was in theatre for four hours. They said my injuries were a lot more complicated than they thought.

'But I will have huge scars for the rest of my life all over my body and my face.

'I never thought in a million years that something like this would happen to me - that I would be attacked like this.'

In a statement read to the court Mr Jukes, who lives in Packmoor, Stoke-on-Trent, said: 'I have received significant, permanent scarring to my face, torso and arms.

'I have been unable to work again. I'm an HGV driver and I cannot even get in a cab now.'

Mr Jukes was slashed by father-of-one Barone who had hit two beer bottles together 

Barone, a father-of-one from Meir, Stoke-on-Trent,  only handed himself into police when Mr Jukes made an emotional public appeal to find the men who attacked him.

The court heard Barone - who has a partner and a two-year-old child - contacted the police on August 2.

Bob Sastry, defending, said: 'He went back to Stoke-on-Trent and, when he saw the report, he handed himself in.

'Without that, there wouldn't be any evidence to him being involved with this case.

'I suppose the police may have caught up with him eventually but equally there's an even chance they might not.'
