Treatment: The cub was first taken to the Metro Richmond Zoo where it was treated for its injuries by a local veterinarian.

After completing her initial diagnosis and treatment, the veterinarian drove the bear to the Wildlife Center in Waynesboro, Metro Richmond zoo owner Jim Andelin told CBS 6.

‘They found several lacerations, some blood in the nose, and some scleral hemorrhages in the eyes (burst blood vessels) – but the big issue is the broken right femur,’ Wildlife Center of Virginia Director of Outreach Amanda Nicholson wrote in an email to the local news channel.

‘They’ll be attempting to pin the fracture today and then will settle the bear into our bear pen facility for recovery,’ Nicholson wrote.

He said the surgery, which began Friday afternoon, would take a couple of hours.

The bear cub is expected to be ok.
