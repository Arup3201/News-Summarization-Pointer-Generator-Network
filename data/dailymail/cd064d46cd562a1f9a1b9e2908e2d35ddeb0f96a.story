Unvetted technology developers who presented two sexist apps to a packed conference have caused a storm in the field of digital technology.

The 24-hour app conference saw two Sydney boys present an app to share pictures of men staring at women's breasts, and another man demonstrating maturation on stage for his 'circle shake' app.

AOL-owned Tech Crunch, the organiser of the Disrupt SF Hackathon conference, initially tweeted links to the apps, but after complaints, issued an apology for allowing the developers to present their inappropriate apps before they were screened.

The company initially tweeted: 'We apologize for two inappropriate hackathon presentations earlier today. We will more carefully screen from now on.'

And later it sent out a more thought-out response on its website, saying the 'spirit of the event was marred by two misogynistic presentations'.

The organisers said that 'sexism is a major problem in the tech industry and we've worked hard to counteract it in our coverage and in our own hiring.'

It blamed a failure to properly screen the presentations and a lack of clear guidelines for participants for the sexist content.Â

The two tech boys developed their app in 24-hours then presented it to an audience at the Tech Crunch conference in San Francisco

They tried to claim that women shouldn't be offended since it was good for men's health

'You expect more from us and we expect more from ourselves. We are sorry,' it said.

David Boulton and Jethro Batts claimed afterwards on Twitter that their 'T*tstare' app was just a 'joke'.

The Sydey duo were the first to present their work from the last 24-hours to the conference on Sunday. They tried to justify their misogynistic app by falsely claiming that staring at women's breasts helps men maintain a healthy heart.

Mr Boulton, who runs a business which sends anonymous 'hateful' postcards to people anywhere in the world, used pictures or women's chests to demonstrate his way through the presentation with his accomplice.

A Tweet after the conference read: 'Titsare guys here, sorry if we offended some of you, very unintentional. Just fun Aussie hack.'

Media reports from the conference point out that the audience contained many women, and even some children - including a nine-year-old tech genius girl who presented her own app.

Her presentation has been overshadowed by the Sydney boys and another inappropriate presentation, which saw a man simulate masturbation on stage - an app which he spent 24 hours developing during the conference.

He encouraged people to download his app to see who could shake their phone the most in 10 seconds.

The second inappropriate app was presented on stage, where a man simulated masturbation - to get as many shakes as possible within 10 seconds

The hackathon, which according to the New York Post, is partly fueled by beer and a sleepless night as teams work round the clock to design, develop and present their apps to an audience, is the prelude to the Disrupt conference, which starts Monday in San Francisco.

A total of 264 entrants each had 60 seconds to present their apps to the audience, taking up five hours on Sunday.
