For the past two years pop star David Archuleta has been on a Mormon mission and away from the spotlight. 

But the American Idol runner-up has announced on YouTube that he has returned home following his two-year-service. 

The 23-year-old Miami native, who grew up in Murray, Utah, always said he was not quitting music but felt he had a strong call to serve the church.

He's back: American Idol's David Archuleta returns home from Mormon mission after two years away

Throughout his mission for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Chile he took the opportunity to share his vocal talents. 

While at the Missionary Training Centre he performed in a missionary choir and two Christmas productions which took place at the Santiago Chile Temple.

Two years ago footage captured at a concert showed Archuleta overwhelmed with emotion and crying when he revealed his plans which led to a standing ovation from the crowd. 

'It's not because someone told me that I'm supposed to do it, and not because I no longer want to do music, but because it's the feeling that I've felt I need to do this with my life,' Archuleta said at the time.

Archuleta was 16 and one of the youngest contestants when he competed on the seventh season of American Idol.

The runner-up has since released three albums, one of which debuted at No. 2 on the Billboard 200 chart.

In 2010, he performed with the Grammy-winning Mormon Tabernacle choir at the group's annual Christmas concert.

Single men typically serve for two years, and women and couples serve for 18 months.Missionaries volunteer for service, but must be selected by program officials in Salt Lake City. They are not paid and must cover their own expenses while in the field.

The church has more than 350 missions worldwide.
