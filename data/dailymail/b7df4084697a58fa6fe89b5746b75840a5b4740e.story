Forget the Barclays Premier League, Manchester United top the Twitter table...

Louis van Gaal might have inherited a side that had temporarily fallen off its perch following the exit of Sir Alex Ferguson, but the Red Devils are proving more popular than ever on social media.

New data released shows United were mentioned more times than any other club - beating Arsenal, Liverpool, Chelsea and neighbours City respectively to the Twitter title.

19. Hull (@HullCity)

20. Burnley (@BurnleyOfficial)

City won't be too keen at not making the top four, however, as they just pip Newcastle to fifth.

Sadly for Burnley, however, they are rock bottom, joined by Hull and Swansea in the relegation places.

But it only gets better for United when it comes to the most followed players, too.

Their former star, Cristiano Ronaldo, has the most admirers (and critics) in the world as the Real Madrid star boasts 31.6million followers.

He's not-so-closely followed by former Real and AC Milan player Kaka, who has 21.5m.

Football dominates the top 10, but there are places for basketball, too.

Cleveland Cavaliers' LeBron James, formerly of Miami Heat, and Oklahoma City Thunder's Kevin Durant have 16.6m and 8.7m respectively.

In terms of the United Kingdom, though, Wayne Rooney is by far the most popular sportsman.

The United and England striker boasts 10.2m ahead of Rio Ferdinand, Gareth Bale and Scottish tennis star Andy Murray. 

But the most retweeted sporting celebrity of the summer was none other than Mario Balotelli.

The Liverpool striker posted his demands during the 2014 World Cup if his Italy side were to do England a favour and beat Costa Rica...

'If we beat Costa Rica I want a kiss, obviously on the cheek, from the UK Queen,' Balotelli wrote.

The Costa Ricans won 1-0, England went home, and, despite getting more than 172,000 retweets, Balotelli's wish never came true.

Balotelli, laughing in the stands, was retweeted more than 172,000 times for his post about the 'UK Queen'

A record 672m tweets were sent about the 2014 World Cup in Brazil during the summer

35.6m tweeted about Germany's 7-1 win over Brazil - the most tweets ever for a single event

The most tweeted about player for Chelsea was David Luiz, Liverpool was Luis Suarez and Southampton was Luke Shaw - none of which are still at those clubs!

In 2014, the word 'selfie' has been mentioned 92m times... a 500 per cent increase and 12x more than in 2013! Lukas Podolski may have helped that, as the selfie king below shows...

Lukas Podolski tweeted this selfie after Germany won the 2014 World Cup - it proved to be rather popular
