Dubbed by experts as Blue Monday, today is officially the most depressing day of the year.

Post-Christmas debt, bad weather and failing New Year's resolutions are all factors in making this innocent Monday in January, the worst in the calendar.

But if you don't want to be sucked into the sadness, here are some instant happiness tricks that psychologists and scientists say will lift your spirits. 

Breathing, laughing, eating and exercising can all boost happiness levels

Plug in your headphones

Scientists at the University of Missouri recently found that people can boost their mood by simply listening to upbeat music.

In the study, participants improved their mood after being told to try to do so, but they only succeeded when they listened to the upbeat music of Copland, as opposed to the sadder tunes of Stravinsky.  

If Stravinsky isn't your thing, an online survey my metrolyrics.com found Wham!'s Wake Me Up Before You Go-Go' was considered the happiest song of all time.

And, with lyrics including, 'You take the grey skies out of my way. You make the sun shine brighter than Doris Day' we have to agree.

Get sweaty for 20 minutes

People often use the terms 'endorphin rush' or 'runner's high' to explain the mood lift elicited by exercise.

But rather than a sudden burst of euphoria, research has found  a mere 20 minutes of cardiovascular exercise can produce more subtle mood benefits that last as long as 12 hours.

That's according to John Ratey, MD, author of Spark: The Revolutionary New Science Of Exercise And The Brain, who puts this happiness effect down to a substances called BDNF.

BDNF rises during exercise, prompting neural growth and repairing damage caused by ongoing stress and depression. 'BDNF is like Miracle-Gro for your brain,' explains Dr Ratey.

Stress out the body and help de-stresses  the mind.

Eat something fishy

Eating oily, fatty fish (salmon, tuna, sardines, rainbow trout) and mussels will give you omega-3s - a key mood-boosting nutrient and one our bodies don't produce naturally. 

Omega-3s alter brain chemicals linked with mood - specifically dopamine and serotonin. 

Low levels of serotonin are linked with depression and aggression, while dopamine is a happy chemical that the brain releases in response to pleasurable experiences.

You may not find eating oily fish pleasurable, but your brain will.

Breathe, like this... 

Breathe in through the nose, hold until it feels slightly uncomfortable and then slowly breathe out.

'Five of those breaths will even out your neurochemistry and make you feel good,' explains Linda Blair, clinical psychologist and author of mindfulness bible 'Key to Calm'.

'When you breathe through the nose rather than the mouth you automatically take in the right amount of oxygen, because it restricts the amount of air you inhale. 

Breathe in through the nose, hold until it feels slightly uncomfortable and then slowly breathe out for an instant 'feel good' boost

'When you take in too much air, you increase oxygen too much and become hyper alert, which isn't "feel good",' she says.

'Holding the breath gives us the message to ourselves that we're in control and breathing out through the mouth gets rid of excess gases in the body.

'Ideally we want a balance of gases so we feel an equilibrium.'

We should in fact be breathing like this at all times, says Linda, but five concentrated breaths is enough to give us an instant boost.

Have a (fake) laugh

When we laugh, our body relaxes and feel-good endorphins are released into the blood stream.

Nothing to chuckle about on Blue Monday? Luckily the body can't distinguish between real and fake laughter. So faking it has the same beneficial effect.

It was Dr William F Fry, a psychiatrist at Stanford University who first began to examine the physiological effects of laughter in the late 1960s and is considered the father of 'gelotology' (the science of laughter). 

He found that laughter, real or fake, provides good physical exercise and increases the body's production of endorphins. 

Dr Madan Kataria set up the first laughter club in Mumbai in 1995 and there are now more than 5,000 laughter clubs worldwide.

But there's no need for any expert tuition. Fake a laugh and the endorphins will come rushing.

Sex with a partner you care about tops the list of oxytocin releasing activities

Now find someone to smile at

Faking a smile or laughter gives you a small boost but smiling warmly at a stranger and eliciting a smile back makes you feel connected and safe.

'The best way to for us to feel good is to feels safe - and the only way we feel safe is to feel connected,' says Linda Blair. 

'We have boosts of cortisol when we're feeling down,' says Linda Blair. 'When you feel safe again the cortisol levels down.' 

She adds: 'Getting a warm response back from a stranger  is so powerful.'

End the day on a high  

It might be too late to start the day in a good mood, but there's one way to guarantee it finishes on a high.

When both men and women orgasm, oxytocin is released, which is the brain chemical that makes us experience feelings of happiness.

Oxytocin has also been found to calm fears and anxiety and increase trust and contentment. 

Positive interaction with friends and family increases the chemical somewhat too, as does any sexual activity. 

But sex with a partner you care about tops the list of oxytocin releasing activities.
