A ‘polar express’ blast of cold air from Greenland is forecast to bring widespread frosts to much of Britain on Christmas Day.

The polar air is expected to reach the top of the country on Monday and begin working its way south throughout the week. 

Rain will hit northern England and Scotland on Monday and temperatures will plummet in the build-up to Christmas Day to as low as -4C.

Met Office forecaster Calum MacColl said: 'For a large chunk of the country it will be a cold, bright, crisp day and it'll be a frost overnight leading into Christmas Day. 

'Certainly overnight Christmas Day into Boxing Day we've got widespread frosts so minus twos, minus threes, and minus fours.

'You could see maximum three degrees in the northern parts, working its way up to six degrees south of the country.'

Mr MacColl added: 'The area of low pressure over Greenland is associated with a front that will affect the country over the coming days. Following that there will be some polar air starting to flow in behind.'

Forecaster Brian Gaze of The Weather Outlook warned it was 'a polar express arriving in time for Christmas, and will be felt most in the north'. 

However, there is no indication there will be a repeat of last Christmas, in which thousands of families spent the day battling storms, floods and power cuts.

Scores of homes were under water, families were evacuated and others struggled to keep up Christmas spirits with no light, heat or cooking facilities after widespread power failures.

But those up north hoping to complete their Christmas shopping this week are still advised to pack a jacket, with rain warnings in place come Monday.

Severe weather warnings have been issued for the west of Scotland and parts of North East England, Yorkshire and the East Midlands.

'As we go into Monday that front is going to continue slowly pushing south, reaching northern England and Ireland,' Mr MacColl said.

Tomorrow and Monday will be hit with 80mm of rain in western Scotland, with 40mm of rain and gales up to 75mph expected in north-east England and south-east Scotland.

The RAC warned of festive period delays and put all 1,500 patrols on standby for overtime. 

Spokesman Simon Williams said: 'Drivers should plan ahead, drive with extra caution and allow extra time for journeys.'
