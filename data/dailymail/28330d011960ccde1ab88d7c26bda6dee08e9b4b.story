Botox is being used to treat women who suffer from persistent genital arousal disorder (PGAD).

This distressing sexual dysfunction causes spontaneous, unwanted and uncontrollable arousal, unrelated to sexual desire, that can last for hours, days or even longer.

Orgasm may only give a few hours of relief.

Doctors in Turkey successfully treated two women with single Botox injections to block the dorsal nerve, which provides sensation to the clitoris.

Both patients reported improved symptoms. The condition is believed to be linked to this nerve.

'Botox reduces electrical activity in the nerve so it can dull an inflamed nerve to provide relief,’ says Botox expert Dr Patrick Bowler, founder  of Courthouse Clinics.

Releasing the tension: Using Botox to treat PGAD could bring relief to thousands as it is believed to be plaguing more than one in 100 women

PGAD was first described in 2001 and can be extremely distressing.

Last year a 39-year-old Florida woman committed suicide after suffering with it for more than 16 years.

The true numbers affected are unknown as many women are too embarrassed to seek help; studies suggest it is more than one in 100 women.
