Boeing sent a 787 up on a test flight today, the first since the new airliner was grounded three weeks ago because of a battery fire.

The company said the aircraft was flying in and out of Boeing Field in Seattle. The plan was to spend two and a half hours in the air, flying back and forth over the inland Columbia Plateau.

The Federal Aviation Administration granted permission for test flights on Thursday. The 787 is the first commercial airliner to rely heavily on lithium-ion batteries, the same kind used in cellphones.

Each plane has two of the 63-pound blue power bricks, one near the front to provide power to the cockpit if the engines stop, and one near the back to start up the auxiliary power unit, which is essentially a backup generator.

On January 7, a battery on a plane that had recently landed in Boston short-circuited and caught fire. Nine days later, a battery on an All Nippon Airways plane started smoking, forcing an emergency landing in Japan.

Boeing Co. has billions of dollars tied up in research on the 787, and billions more dollars in 787s parked in Everett, Wash., and other sites that are waiting to be delivered.

The test flight took place after it emerged Boeing were left to carry out their own safety checks on the lithium batteries that grounded all their Dreamliner jets as there were no federal guidelines in existence at the time.

When the disaster-stricken airliner was in development, Boeing was granted what the Federal Aviation Authority called 'special conditions,' for its planned use of the new lithium technology.

By the time official guidelines for the batteries were created in 2008, the Dreamliner had already been approved so it did not have to meet them.

Link: Investigators found similar damage to the lithium ion battery occured in both incident

An investigation into last month's 
battery fire in a Japan Airlines 787 'Dreamliner' while it was parked in
Boston, shows it began with multiple short-circuits in one of the 
battery's eight cells.

The results so far contradict some of 
the assumptions that were made about the battery's safety at the time 
the system won government approval, said the board's chairwoman, Deborah
Hersman.

The NTSB investigation shows the fire started with multiple short-circuits in one of the battery's eight cells, she said.

That created an uncontrolled chemical 
reaction known as 'thermal runaway,' which is characterized by 
progressively hotter temperatures.

That spread the short-circuiting to the rest of the cells and caused the fire, she said.

The findings are at odds with what 
Boeing told the FAA when that agency was working to certify the 
company's newest and most technologically advanced plane for flight, 
Hersman said.

Boeing said its testing showed that 
even when trying to induce short-circuiting, the condition and any fire 
were contained within a single cell, preventing thermal runaway and fire
from spreading, she told reporters at a news conference.

Boeing's testing also showed the batteries were likely to cause smoke in only 1 in 10 million flight hours, she said.

But the Boston fire was followed nine 
days later by a smoking battery in an All Nippon Airways plane that made
an emergency landing in Japan. The 787 fleet has recorded less than 
100,000 flight hours, Hersman noted.

The plane that caught fire in Boston 
was delivered to Japan Airlines less than three weeks before the fire 
and had recorded only 169 flight hours over 22 flights.

'There have now been two battery events resulting in smoke less than two weeks apart on two different aircraft,' Hersman said.

'This investigation has demonstrated 
that a short circuit in a single cell can propagate to adjacent cells 
and result in smoke and fire. The assumptions used to certify the 
battery must be reconsidered.'

Battery experts said Boeing could try 
to build more safeguards into the battery by using a greater number of 
smaller cells and putting more insulation between them.

Or, they said, the aircraft maker 
could switch to a different type of lithium ion battery already approved
for aviation. Some business jets use lithium ion batteries as their 
main batteries.

Switching to another type of battery, 
such as lead-acid or nickel-cadmium battery, is another possibility, but
that would involve changing the charging system as well, they said.

Deliveries of Boeing's Dreamliner 
passenger jets will be delayed due to ongoing safety concerns, the 
troubled manufacturer has admitted.

Boeing
currently has orders for around 800 787s, however all 50 of the 
problematic planes already supplied to airlines remain grounded until a 
serious battery issue is fixed.

Battery
malfunctions led to a fire on board a parked Japan Airlines (JAL) 787 
in Boston and an in-flight problem on another plane in Japan which was 
forced to make an emergency landing.

Airbus is considering dropping Lithium-Ion batteries and switching back to traditional units on its new A350 aircraft as safety investigators probe battery incidents on Boeing's 787 Dreamliner, several people familiar with the matter said.

The move comes amid a wider rethink in the aerospace industry on whether the powerful but delicate backup energy systems are technically 'mature', they said.

An Airbus spokesman said the company would study and evaluate the outcome of the ongoing U.S. battery investigation. 'Let's not get ahead of ourselves', he said.

Airbus said recently it had a plan B and time to respond to any rule changes.

France's Saft, which makes both the new and old generation of batteries for Airbus, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

One operator, Norwegian Air Shuttle, 
which is due to launch a long-haul service, said it now plans to lease 
other aircraft to replace the 787s they have on order.

Boeing had warned the Norwegian Air 
that deliveries were uncertain because of the investigation by the US 
National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB).

The carrier said in a statement this 
morning: 'The extent of a possible delay and whether such delay will 
affect later deliveries is presently not known.

'Norwegian is taking precautionary steps by planning for substitute aircraft capacity.'

Earlier today the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration cleared Boeing Co
to restart test flights of its grounded 787 Dreamliner in order to get 
more data on potentially faulty batteries.

The groundings have cost airlines tens of millions of dollars, and there appears to be no end in sight.

Norwegian Air Shuttle, which is aiming
to take on established airlines in the overseas sector,  was due to 
take delivery of eight Dreamliners in April.

The firm had already sold a number of discounted tickets for its first overseas flights.

They added: 'In the event that the 787
is not operational in time for Norwegian's services to New York and 
Bangkok replacement long-haul aircraft will be leased to ensure flights 
are operated as scheduled.'On Thursday a one-off flight was approved to move a 787 from Texas to Washington state, where Boeing is based for examination.

The introduction of the Dreamliner has been fraught with difficulties from the start.

The first three 787s were found to be 
overweight. There were also problems sourcing certain parts and in the 
development of the on board software.

Test flights were delayed by a machinists strike and Rolls Royce was said to have struggled to supply the engines on time.

Positive step: Boeing was been given permission to carry out fresh test flights with the 787 Dreamliner jet on Thursday

In June 2010 Boeing stunned the 
aviation industry by postponing the first flight indefinitely after 
engineers discovered  structural flaws.

Then in November that year a test 
flight had to make an emergency landing in Laredo, Texas, after crew 
notice smoke in the cabin.

Earlier this week images of the charred remains of the battery which spontaneously combusted in Japan were released.

Pictures released by the Japanese 
Transportation Safety Board showed the blackened lithium device with 
frayed and broken earth wire.

Investigators are trying to establish 
the cause of an in-flight fire which forced an All Nippon Airways flight
to make an emergency landing in Japan last month.

CAT scans of the overheated lithium 
ion battery revealed similar damage to an incident just over a week 
earlier on January 7 which saw another Dreamliner make an emergency 
landing in Boston.

The latest probe is said to have found
evidence of short-circuiting and 'thermal runaway' - a chemical 
reaction which causes overheating.

Pilots
and safety advocates argued that it is too risky to fly with the 
batteries on board at all if the plane's battery system makes it too 
unsafe to fly.

The 
Dreamliner is the first airliner to make extensive use of lithium-ion 
batteries. They charge faster and can be better moulded to space-saving 
shapes compared with other aeroplane batteries.

Mike 
Sinnett, chief engineer on the 787, said last month that the plane's 
batteries have operated through a combined 1.3 million hours and never 
had an internal fault.

He said they were built with multiple protections to ensure that failures 'don't put the airplane at risk'.
