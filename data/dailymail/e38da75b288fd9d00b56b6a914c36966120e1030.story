Most of Ian McEwan's novels come in at 200 pages or fewer

With some of his most acclaimed works coming in at barely 200 pages, Ian McEwan is known for his ability to write concisely.

But it is a skill the novelist said is missing from some of his contemporaries, as he criticised the growing trend of blockbuster novels – often running to as many as 900 pages – saying few ‘earn their length’ and many are in need of editing.

Speaking yesterday to Radio Four’s Today programme, The Man Booker and Jerusalem Prize winner, 66, said that when reading such lengthy tomes, ‘My fingers are always twitching for a blue pencil.’

And asked what he thought of the trend more generally – the interviewer Mishal Husain singled out The Goldfinch (880 pages) and The Luminaries (848 pages) as examples – McEwan said: ‘The Americans especially love a really huge novel, they still pursue the notion of a great American novel and it has to be a real brick of an object. Very few really long novels earn their length.’

Giving the interview to publicise his sixteenth novel, The Children Act – published today and which comes in at 224 pages – McEwan was asked if his works were too short to be counted as novels and should instead be seen as novellas.

He said: ‘I would arbitrarily put the novella at 40,000 words and this is maybe 15,000 words more than that. If we can make this fine distinction, it’s a short novel rather than a novella.

‘But I do love this form, the idea of sitting down with a book that you could read in one sitting or within three hours, much as you might go to a movie or an opera or a long play.

‘I think you’ve got to establish characters very quickly, there’s room for one or two subplots, it’s a form I adore actually.’

Speaking about the themes running through The Children Act, which sees the courts intervene when a teenager refuses a lifesaving blood transfusion because of his faith as a Jehovah’s Witness, he said: ‘I would say that it’s fine for adults to die for their faith, as long as they harm no one else, but children who have had no other take on the world presented to them, I think this is the point the law must intervene.

‘I think if you had asked me in the 1980s the future of faith, I would have said it was endlessly diminished but now it does seem to be centre stage. As for religion in schools, my view is teach comparative religions, teach all religions but basically let children grow up to make their own minds, I’m more with the French on this.’

In the wide-ranging interview, he also addressed the rise of e-readers, such as Amazon’s Kindle, in the place of traditional paper books.

It is a shift McEwan said he is relaxed about, although did admit to concerns over how it is currently being delivered.

He said: ‘I don’t think e-readers make much difference to us at all, there’s still the sentence, the paragraph, the pages, it’s just a method of delivery as far as I am concerned. I do worry about the preponderance of Amazon and many publishers being in direct conflict with it - giant monopolies are never good for any enterprise and of course I would like it to be paying its taxes like the rest of us.

‘The trouble is, it’s like some delicious drug, you can’t really resist it. I’ve forsworn it many times than I want a book the next morning so I’m much like anyone else. I would just like there to be three or four Amazons, that’s what I’d like.’
