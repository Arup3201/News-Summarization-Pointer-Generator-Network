Not taking any risks: The Duchess of Cambridge, who is now heavily-pregnant, has decided not to attend a society wedding in Northumberland

The Duchess of Cambridge has been forced to pull out of attending the society wedding of the year amid fears she could go into labour.

Pregnant Kate, 31, and husband Prince William, were expected to be guests of honour at the wedding of Thomas 
Van Straubenzee, 30, and the Duke of Northumberland's daughter Lady 
Melissa Percy, 26, at Alnwick Castle tomorrow.

But while her due date is still some weeks off, the Duchess has decided not to risk the 300-mile drive to the North East.

It is understood William, who is best man, will still be attending with his brother Prince Harry, 28, and his girlfriend Cressida Bonas, 24.

Guests are also expected to include Harry's ex-girlfriend Chelsy Davy.

'The birth may be a few weeks off, but there is still a very slim risk she could go into labour,' a source told The Sun.

'Kate is gutted - as are Tom and Melissa - but she decided not to take any chances.'

The Duchess's final official public appearance was last weekend when she attended the Trooping the Colour ceremony with other members of the Royal Family.

But with the wedding taking place in Northumberland and her baby due in mid-July, Kate has decided not to travel.

The groom is a long-time friend of both William and Harry, and the brothers were at the chartered surveyor's London stag do earlier this month.

Mr van Straubenzee travelled to New Zealand with William on a gap year and was reportedly on the phone to Harry when he was mugged in London last year.

It was said that Harry alerted police and went out to find his friend after the ordeal.

Lady Melissa is the Duke of 
Northumberland's second daughter and she will exchange vows with Mr van 
Straubenzee in a parish church close to her family's ancestral home, 
Alnwick Castle, near Newcastle.

Kate's sister, Pippa Middleton, attended the 2011 wedding of the bride-to-be's older sister, Lady Katie, to Patrick Valentine.

Ms Middleton is a friend of the Duke of Northumberland's son, Earl George Percy.
Chelsy Davy, who dated Harry, will be among the 500 guests tomorrow.

The bride will leave Alnwick Castle -
 which has doubled as Hogwarts in the Harry Potter films - in a restored
 horse-drawn carriage that is almost 200 years old.

She will wear a Bruce Oldfield dress with flowers by local florist Caro Dickinson, who has also decorated the church and castle.

Lady Melissa, who is a tennis coach, will be attended by her sister and Ms Davy, as well as 12 pages and bridesmaids.

After the 5pm service, a reception will be held in the castle's State Rooms, followed by dinner in a marquee.

There will be fireworks in the evening which the public can watch from the Pastures below the castle.

Soon after the wedding, Lady 
Melissa's dress will be displayed alongside her sister Katie's wedding 
dress in The Coach House at Alnwick Castle.
