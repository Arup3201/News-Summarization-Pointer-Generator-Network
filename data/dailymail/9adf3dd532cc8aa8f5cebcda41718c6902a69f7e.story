Lawyer David Latham threw himself in front of a Tube train the day after he had warned a colleague he was going to kill himself

A partner at a top law firm who threw himself under a Tube train had warned a colleague he was going to kill himself the day before, an inquest has heard.

Colleagues of David Latham, 58, a world-renowned trademark lawyer at Hogan and Lovells, had noticed he was 'inconsolable' as he worried over the fate of a big case.

After weeks of sleepless nights, the father-of-three, from Kensington, west London, told a fellow partner that he was planning to kill himself but the remark was dismissed as a 'flippant comment'.

The next day, on February 15 this year, Mr Latham jumped in front of a tube train in west London.

His wife, Gillian Webb, told Westminster Coroner's Court more should have been done by his employers to help her husband.

She said: 'If a person shows the signs as David clearly had, they should have something put in place to prevent such tragedies.'

Ms Webb said Mr Latham's colleague only revealed his threat to kill himself after he had failed to show up for work the day he died.

'She said David came into the office and said I'm going to kill myself', she said.

'She said he went into the office and closed the door, which is normally lawyer-speak for "this is important".'

Nicholas MacFarlane, another partner at the law firm, said Mr Latham was a 'perfectionist' who was beset with worries that a big case he was handling had come unstuck because of evidence problems.

'He was worried the whole thing would reflect badly on him', he said. 'He thought he had made a mistake and he was very concerned about that. 

Mr Latham was a world-renowned trademark lawyer at Hogan and Lovells

'He definitely got very exercised about it, and I used the word inconsolable. However much we persuaded him that it wasn't important, he thought it was.'

Mr MacFarlane said the threat to kill 
himself had been dismissed as a 'flippant comment', but constant efforts
were made to reassure him the mistake did not matter and may not ever 
have been discovered.

He said: 'The firm is actively looking at how to give support to stressed lawyers.

'But not one of us said "my God, he is near to the edge of suicide".

'When he said he was going to kill himself, it was a flippant comment and unfortunately no one took any notice of it.'

Ms Webb said her husband had complained of not being supported at work as the strain of the case took its toll.

Westminster Coroner's Court heard how Mr Latham had struggled to sleep in the weeks before he jumped in front of a train

She said: 'The client had taken the stand and introduced evidence that wasn't in the affidavit, it had upset David and he had to go back and rewrite the affidavit and submit it to the court.

'He was very upset that it wasn't going to look good for him, but more importantly for the firm.

'I said you can't legislate for how people act on witness stand, it was out of his hands.'

She said Mr Latham 'tossed and turned' at night for weeks, and had been on edge the night before he died during a Valentine's Day meal at Claridges.

His mobile phone received a steady stream of messages throughout the evening, she said, and he knew they were from work.

'He was looking at me, like this was supposed to be a nice meal but he knew it was communications coming through.'

Ms Webb said the couple were planning to go on holiday in a week's time, and Mr Latham had promised to take her shoe shopping at the weekend before a night at the opera.

But she added: 'He had trouble sleeping at night for several weeks.

'I saw him staring into space at times, and even the children noticed it at weekends.'

She said she did not hear her husband leave the house early the next morning, and had no idea what he was planning.

Coroner Jean Harkin ruled Mr Latham had committed suicide, after being satisfied that the balance of his mind was not affected when he died.

'It is clear that he was involved in a matter of work where he felt that he would be criticised and despite reassurances from partners and colleagues at work, he retained those thoughts', she said.

'At home he was greatly affected by events at work and felt unsupported. 

'However, in evidence heard from Mr 
MacFarlane, he was consistently reassured, and even leading counsel 
reassured him that he hadn't done anything wrong and in any event it was
of no consequence.'

She added: 'Mr Latham jumped in front of a train of his own accord.

'He was suffering from stress like 
symptoms at work and he was deemed to be very worried about this case to
the point of being inconsolable, but that doesn't satisfy me that the 
balance of his mind was affected.'

Cambridge-educated
Mr Latham, who regularly featured in the Who's Who list of 
International Trademark Lawyers, was made partner of law firm Hogan and 
Lovells in 1988, just two years after joining, and ran the company's New
York office for many years.

'When he said he was going to kill himself, it was a flippant comment and unfortunately no one took any notice of it'

The firm, with headquarters in London and Washington DC, has more than 2,500 lawyers working out of 40 offices around the world.

In a statement after his death, colleagues described Mr Latham as an 'utterly charming man who was one of life's true gentlemen'.

'A likeable, modest man, David was not only an exceptional lawyer and consummate professional; he was also a great colleague, loyal partner and a friend to many at the firm', they said.

'He was one of the few people who could walk into a room and make sure he spoke to every person in it.'
