Thousands of fans roared as New York Giants quarterback Eli Manning hoisted the team's Super Bowl trophy, awarded to the NFL champions, from a glittering blue-and-white float during a victory parade through New York City.

Mayor Michael Bloomberg quipped during the ceremony today that the city should now be nicknamed the 'Big Blue Apple.'

The parade began at the southern tip of Manhattan and moved north to City Hall as fans were clad head-to-toe in Giants gear and confetti wafted slowly down from the high-rises lining the street.

Manning, joined by coach Tom Coughlin, Mayor Bloomberg, Gov Andrew Cuomo and other teammates, waved and grinned from the float as a deep roar rose from the crowds.

Defensive end Justin Tuck, who led the team's defense and sacked rival quarterback Tom Brady twice during the 21-17 victory over the New England Patriots, said he was glad to be part of the team.

'We made it here by believing in each other. We believe in every guy on this team,' he said. 'Honestly, we wouldn't be here today without your support.'The team was introduced at a City Hall Plaza ceremony with thunderous applause from the thousands of fans outside.

The crowd went wild for running back Ahmed Bradshaw, who plopped down in the end zone to score the winning touchdown.

Manning joked about the team's record of fourth-quarter comebacks. 'Make it tough but make it possible,' he said, laughing about how the team blew an early lead to come back and win.

The Giants had eight fourth-quarter comebacks to win games during the season.

'Finish games, finish fourth quarters and finish the season strong. That's what we did,' Manning said.

The team was introduced with thunderous applause from the lucky 250 fans who got tickets to a ceremony at City Hall Plaza, where the Giants were honoured with symbolic keys to the city.

Mayor Bloomberg reminded the cheering crowd that this was the second Super Bowl championship parade for the Giants in four years.

President Barack Obama has offered his personal congratulations to the New York Giants on their Super Bowl victory.

Coughlin said the Giants were successful because they never gave up.

'The key thing was to remember this: All things are possible for those who believe,' Coughlin said. 'We always believed.'

The White House says Obama called Coughlin this morning and told the Giants coach that his team's victory was a testament to his leadership.

Obama told Coughlin he looks forward to welcoming the Giants to the White House. Sports champions are traditionally honored with a ceremony at the White House.

Some fans waited since 6am to catch a glimpse of their favorite players.

About half of a Long Island high school class skipped school to see 'a whole nation coming together in one place - this parade,' said Mike King, 16, of Wantagh, N.Y.

King and seven school friends got up at dawn, arriving by subway in lower Manhattan to join the crowds packed behind police barricades lining Broadway.

He attributed the win to Manning's stellar performance and the hold-your-breath catch by Mario Manningham that led to the game-winning drive.

Frank Capogrosso, 11, from Staten Island, leaned against a barricade at the beginning of the parade route with his dad and best friend.

'This is better than TV. I love the cop cars, the toilet paper and the ecstatic fans,' he said. 'I love the Giants. I love their style. They play, they don't talk.'The parade for the Super Bowl champions will have an estimated economic impact of up to $38 million for the city, depending on the number of spectators, Bloomberg said.

As many as 1 million were expected - about a third of them from outside New York.

Bloomberg asked: 'Are you feeling deja blue all over again?' referring to the team's 2008 win. The crowd cheered.

Faithful: Fans were lined up as early as 6am hoping to catch a glimpse of their favourite gridiron stars

It's hard to imagine a victory more exciting than the Giants' last-minute 21-17 victory over the Patriots.Â 

The hero of this year's parade was Manning, the Super Bowl's Most Valuable Player who hoisted the Vince Lombardi Trophy for all to see.

Workers in high-rises tossed confetti - and later entire pieces of papers - from their windows.

Jun Kim, 28, a Korean linguist at the law firm Kenyon & Kenyon, reserved his biggest batch for Manning.

'You are a star!' he yelled as the quarterback passed by. 'People thought he would crumble under pressure, but he didn't. He's the best.'

Just moments after the parade passed by, a lineup of sanitation plows scraped their way up Broadway, pushing mounds of confetti - some as high as 5 feet.As the parade wound up around noon, fans stood on sidewalks ankle deep in the paper that was later sucked up by sanitation workers armed with hand-held vacuums.

New York City Sanitation Commissioner John Doherty said he expected to see about 40 tons of paper showered down. That's a lot but not one for the record books.

The streets in lower Manhattan on Tuesday were a mass of metal police barricades, and security was tight with helicopters flying overhead and police command centers parked nearby.

Mindy Forman, 53, of Yorktown, New York, was one of the lucky few who scored a ticket to the festivities at City Hall.

She said the win was a much-needed victory at a time when many could use some cheering up.

She counted herself among that group: She was laid off two weeks ago from her job as a college administrator.

'It celebrates New York,' she said. 'It celebrates the city. It celebrates the state. And it gives people something to believe in in very hard times.'

The city threw 5,438 tons of ticker tape on returning veterans at the end of World War II in 1945.

The second-highest amount of paper was thrown to honor astronaut John Glenn in 1962 - 3,474 tons.

The actual ticker tape from those days has been replaced by recycled paper that's shredded into confetti.

Sanitation spokeswoman Kathy Dawkins says the department picked up 34.2 tons of paper after the Giants' last parade in 2008.

Even before the parade started, city sanitation crews with hand-held vacuums were ready to suck up the piles of confetti that would rain on Broadway.

New York has feted its public heroes since 1919, with the first parade for World War I General John Pershing and his victorious troops.

They were followed by more than 200 parades honoring such people as aviator Charles Lindbergh, scientist Albert Einstein, Pope John Paul, South African leader Nelson Mandela and pianist Van Cliburn.Â
