In 2016, a team of engineers will attempt to smash the land speed record by reaching more than 1,000mph in their Bloodhound supersonic car (SSC).

The project has been seven years in the making and has been a dream of former RAF pilot Andy Green since he set the current record in 1997.

Now, it has moved a step closer to reality - with the hybrid rocket engine them car will use being fired for the first time.

The supersonic car will use one Nammo hybrid rocket in high speed testing scheduled for 2015 and a cluster of three rockets in its 1,000mph (1,609 km/h) campaign in 2016.

The firing lasted for a predefined 16 seconds, producing a maximum thrust of 30 kN (or 3 tons).

A hybrid rocket combines a liquid oxidizer (hydrogen peroxide) and a solid fuel (synthetic rubber) to allow the rocket to be throttled or shut off, a feature beyond the capabilities of traditional solid rockets.

The test burn lasted for 16 seconds and produced 30 kN (kiloNewtons) or 3 tons of thrust. 

Temperature inside the rocket reached 2,200 degrees celsius and 1,200 degrees in the plume, more commonly known as the massive jet of flame shooting out the end.

The test, conducted by the Bloodhound team's rocket partner Nammo tests the first in a series of large hybrid rocket motors at their Norwegian test site.

This is addition to main the main engine, which is normally found powering a Eurofighter Typhoon, weighs a tonne and produces 20,000lbs (90kN) - or nine tonnes of thrust. 

The two power plants together produce 135,000 thrust horse power, or the equivalent to 180 Formula 1 cars. 

The test firing of the rocket was an unprecedented success, the team said. 

The firing lasted for a predefined 16 seconds, producing a maximum thrust of 30 kN (or 3 tons).

The rocket will also be used to power spacecraft. 

Nammo’s work with hybrid technology has been supported by the European Space Agency (ESA) since 2010, notably under its Future Launchers Preparatory Programme (FLPP).  

Driver Andy Green, 51, is hoping to break the world land speed record when he tests the £10 million rocket-powered vehicle next year. 

The upper chassis is made of strong, but lightweight aluminium, onto which titanium stringers and titanium skin will be fixed using glue and 1,400 aircraft specification rivets.

The lower chassis, below the jet, is made of aluminium and steel, and houses the Nammo hybrid rocket.   

The pencil-shaped car will be 44ft (13.4m) long, 6ft (183cm) in diameter, and weigh 7.5 tonnes when completed.

Chief engineer Mark Chapman said: 'For us at Bloodhound, it is immensely exciting, this is the motor that's going to take us to break the record.

'For us this is a really important test. 

The SSC stands for ‘SuperSonic Car’.

The vehicle has four wheels and is powered by both the newly-fitted jet engine and a rocket.

It is set to travel at 1,000mph (1,600km/h).

The slender body, 44 feet (14 metres) long, keeps the entire vehicle aerodynamic.

It weighs just over seven tonnes and the engines will produce more than 135,000 horsepower.

That’s more than six times the power of all the cars on a Formula 1 starting grid put together.

In the coming years the vehicle will begin test runs at lower speeds before attempting to set a new land speed record.

The current land speed record stands at 763.035mph (1,227.985km/h), set by former RAF pilot Andy Green - who will also drive the Bloodhound - back in 1997 in the ThrustSSC. 

The project is on course for the finished car to roll out for low speed testing at up to 200mph (321km/h) at Newquay’s Aerohub next summer.

The team will then head to South Africa and attempt to break the 1,000mph barrier on a purpose-built 12-mile track in the desert in 2015 and 2016.

During the record-chasing run, Bloodhound will cover 12 miles (19km) in two minutes, exerting an acceleration force of almost 2G, and peak deceleration force of 3G on the driver.

Earlier this year, designers of the supersonic car revealed the vehicle’s futuristic cockpit.

It has been made from five different types of carbon fibre weave, and two different resins. It has taken more than 10,000 hours to design and manufacture in total.

The project is on course for the finished car to roll out for low speed testing at up to 200mph (321km/h) at Newquay’s Aerohub next summer.

The team behind the Bloodhound SSC also revealed how they intend to slow it from 1,000mph (1,600km/h) to zero. 

After the car reaches its top speed, air brakes and parachutes slow it to 160mph (260km/h).

Breaking to this speed is done at a constant 3G deceleration - equivalent to going from 60mph (95km/h) in a normal car to zero in just one second - for 20 seconds.

At this speed the cars wheels are still spinning 10,000 times per minute.

Attempts to use carbon rotors from a jet fighter in the form of car-like disc brakes shattered at speeds of just half this, so the team needed a new approach.

Instead, they switched to steel rotors. 

In tests, these could withstand temperatures of up to 850°C (1,560°F), and be used again.

The next step will be to test these brakes out at the full 10,000rpm that will be experienced.

Sandwiched between the layers of carbon fibre are three different thicknesses of aluminium honeycomb core, which provide additional strength.

At its thickest point the material is made up of 13 layers, but measures just 0.9-inches (24mm) thick.

The cockpit structure weighs 441lbs (200kg) and bolts directly to the metallic rear chassis carrying the jet, rocket and racing car engine.

It has to be strong as this front section will have to endure peak aerodynamic loads of up to three tonnes per square metre at 1,000mph (1,609kph), as well the considerable forces generated by the front wheels and suspension.

It will also carry ballistic armour to protect Wing Commander Green should a stone be thrown up by the front wheels at very high speeds.

The cockpit is positioned in front of three loud motors - the jet, a cluster of hybrid rockets and the racing car engine that drives the rocket’s oxidiser pump, which are expected to generate a noise level estimated at 140 decibels - the equivalent to a shotgun blast.

Wing Commander Green will wear a specially made in-ear communications system to protect his hearing and to ensure that he can communicate with mission control.

This last stint to zero is where the problem lies, however. 

Even at this speed the cars wheels are still spinning 10,000 times per minute.

Attempts to use carbon rotors from a jet fighter in the form of car-like disc brakes shattered at speeds of just half this, so the team needed a new approach.

Instead, they switched to steel rotors from brake manufacturer AP Racing. In tests these proved much more promising, withstanding temperatures of up to 850°C (1,560°F). They even survived to such an extent that they can be used again.

The next step will be to test these brakes out at the full 10,000rpm that will be experienced.
