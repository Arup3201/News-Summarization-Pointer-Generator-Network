QPR manager Harry Redknapp wants to sign two midfielders and a striker before the transfer window closes.

Rangers have so far added four new recruits to the squad but Redknapp has been left short after players were released and last year's loanees returned to their parent clubs.

Redknapp has already signed Steven Caulker and Jordon Mutch from Cardiff, Rio Ferdinand from Manchester United and Mauricio Isla on loan from Juventus.

'We need to get a couple more in, we're short in some areas,' Redknapp said.

'I've got three central midfield players - Joey Barton, Alejandro Faurlin and Karl Henry - when you need six midfield players really at this level.

'So we're looking to get one or two midfielders in and maybe a front man as well because we need a bit of cover there. You need four strikers in an ideal world.'

Redknapp added: 'If you look at the whole squad with everyone fit we've got 18 or 19 outfield players and that includes one or two lads who couldn't get in the squad last year.'

Helping hand: West Ham midfielder Ravel Morrison made a significant contribution to QPR's promotion 

Rangers used the loan system to their advantage last season in the Championship as the likes of Tom Carroll, Niko Kranjcar and Ravel Morrison all made significant contributions.

'We'll probably use the loan system again. Maybe we'll buy one and loan a couple,' Redknapp said after QPR were beaten 1-0 by Hull at Loftus Road on Saturday.

'I think the chairman is close to doing a couple of deals today, I'm hoping he is.

'I spoke to him before the game and he's confident he'll get another couple that I'm after.'

Uncertain: French striker Loic Remy could still leave the club before the transfer window closes

The future of Loic Remy, who came close to joining Liverpool earlier in the transfer window, is still uncertain.

The French forward is keen to leave Loftus Road but is waiting to be approached by a club who can challenge for a Champions League spot.

'He's got a buy-out clause which is a problem, because if someone comes in and offers the money you lose him,' Redknapp said.

'If he goes you're looking for two strikers, which isn't easy to find, but if he's going to leave QPR, it's got to be to a big club - a top-seven club I would think.

'He didn't want to go back to Newcastle which is a massive club, so unless it's a club in the top seven I don't think he'll go.'

On the move: Benfica are hoping to agree a deal to take Julio Cesar to the Stadium of Light

One player who does look set to leave is goalkeeper Julio Cesar.

The 34-year-old, who joined Rangers in August 2012, was due to hold talks with Benfica over the weekend with a view to completing a transfer.

Redknapp's side will be looking to bounce back from their opening day defeat when they travel to Tottenham on Sunday.

The fixture means a return to White Hart Lane for Redknapp, who was sacked by Spurs in June 2012.

'It's a tough game but I'm looking forward to going back there,' Redknapp said.

'They'll be strong this year. With the money they spent last year they've got to be pushing for the top four.'
