With Frank Lampard set to return to Stamford Bridge with Manchester City, Chelsea season-ticket holder BEN REBUCK explains why his legacy at the Blues is tarnished.

Chelsea vs Manchester City is the biggest game of the season by a mile, it could easily decide the destination of the league title. Frank Lampard has won these sort of games for Chelsea countless times - I can’t believe he’ll be lining up against us.

On September 21 last year, around 3000 Chelsea fans, including myself, made the trip up north for what was already billed as a title showdown at the Etihad Stadium. 

When Andre Schurrle opened the scoring for the Blues, and with City then reduced to 10 men, most of us thought we’d see a repeat of the win from last season. Then Frank came on…

What an ovation he received after leaving the club after 13 years almost through the back door at the end of last season. But then he scored. Frank had just scored against Chelsea. Our all-time record goalscorer had just dented our title hopes with one felled swoop of his right boot. It went quiet. ‘Who scored? It wasn’t Frank was it?’

That’s all I remember. On a personal level, this was up there with JT’s slip in Moscow and Iniesta’s last minute winner at the Bridge. Granted that will be met with some ridicule, but this is my childhood hero.

The goading began. The long walk back to Manchester Piccadilly was met with cries and jeers of ‘super Frankie Lampard’ from the City faithful. That’s when it started to turn a bit sour.

The weeks went on and with that came the goals. A crucial strike against Southampton with City down to 10 and a New Year’s Day winner at Sunderland spring to mind. Lampard had certainly split the opinion of the Chelsea fans.

With time passing, surely it was about time Frank left to New York? He’d done his bit for City but we’d been told that was that. Not to be. He’s staying to the end of the season and the news of the deal had come out. We’d been sold a dud and that really hurt.

Frank, who supposedly said he’d never play for another English team, had not only gone against his word, but had joined our main title rivals.

That’s the key here-title rivals. No, Chelsea and City don’t have much of a traditional rivalry; Lampard hadn’t joined Spurs or Liverpool, even Arsenal or West Ham, but he had gone to the one team who have a genuine chance of scuppering what could be our first title in five years.

All this leaves one hell of a bitter taste in the mouth for someone who should have left on an almighty high as the greatest ever to wear the Royal Blue.

With that in mind, it doesn’t change what Frank has done for Chelsea; three Premier League titles, captaining the side to their first Champions League trophy, four FA Cups, two League Cups, a Europa League crown - the honours of a true legend, a legend who should, in theory, be receiving the same reception that Didier Drogba got on his return with Galatasary last season.

But, unfortunately, the issue has divided the support like no other and no-one quite knows what tomorrow will bring.

I certainly will not be singing his name.

I won’t boo him either, but we all know Frank is the model professional and will be out to beat us in the biggest game of the season.

If the unfathomable happens and he scores the winner, I cannot imagine what will transpire. It’s an inconceivable outcome that would possibly tarnish his reputation with even the most ardent of supporters.

I think we’d all like to see this debacle over and done with as soon as possible. Once Frank spends a few years lifting titles in the USA - another continent on which he’ll win more than ‘Stevie G’ - he’d be more than welcome back to the Bridge as a member of staff, a club ambassador or even a ball boy.

But please, Frank, don’t make this harder than it already is.
