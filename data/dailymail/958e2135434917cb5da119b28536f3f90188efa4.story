TOWIE beauty Sam Faiers has been named the celebrity with the best bikini body of 2013.

The star fought off tough competition, including from love rival Amy Willerton and superstar Rhianna, to scoop the title

The survey asked 680 women to name the celebrity whose body they’d most love to be able to flaunt on the beach - and Sam took a fifth (20 per cent) of the vote.

The 22-year-old reality star is regularly photographed on holiday with her sister Billie and TOWIE cast mates showing off her bikini body.

After having recently slimmed down and toned up for the festive season, Sam has been following a no carbs, no alcohol regime, and has let her fans see the enviable results through her social media accounts after snapping multiple selfies in her underwear. 

Taking second place was Sam’s former co-star Lucy Mecklenburgh, with 17 per cent of women saying they’d love her figure.

She was followed by curvaceous reality TV star Kim Kardashian who was voted for by 13 per cent of respondents.

Pop star and Bajan beauty Rihanna took tenth place with one per cent voting for her.

One respondent said: ‘Sam Faiers looks amazing. She has a great figure and proves that exercise can help you keep trim and toned rather than trying faddy diets. She also has some gorgeous bikinis  - I’m always green with envy when I see her looking so gorgeous on the beach.'

Another said: ‘Lucy Mecklenburgh has had a great year – she’s completely transformed herself and has a really enviable figure. If I looked like her I’d definitely be flaunting my bikini body on the beach.

A third added: ‘For me Kelly Brook has the ultimate figure. She looks like a real woman not an ultra skinny model and has curves in all the right places. She’s happy to show them off too – good for her.’

A spokeswoman for CheapHolidayLand.com, who conducted the study said: ‘All these women are beautiful and no one can argue that they have amazing figures that each and everyone of us would happily flaunt on the beach.

‘They’re good role models too – they diet and exercise sensibly, lead healthy lifestyles and prove that combining these means they stay toned, trim and looking amazing.’
