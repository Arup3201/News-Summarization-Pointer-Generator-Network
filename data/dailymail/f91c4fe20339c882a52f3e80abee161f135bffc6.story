Former NFL star and actor Alex Karras died today after years of health woes which his wife blamed on the punishing, physical toll of a long football career.Â 

The former All-Pro defensive lineman and actor passed away at the age of 77 surrounded by family at his Los Angeles home. He had fought kidney disease, heart disease and for the last two years stomach cancer.

The NFL veteran had also been suffering from 
dementia and his death puts the spotlight on the NFL's conflict with thousands of former players over concussions.

In April, Karras joined more than 3,500 former players suing the league for not protecting them better from head injuries, immediately becoming one of the best-known names in the legal fight.

'It's the same thing as back in the 
gladiator days when the gladiators fought to death,' said his lawyer 
Craig Mitnick, who represents Karras and hundreds of others in the suit.

'Fans care about these guys when 
they're playing and they are heroes. But as soon as you're not a hero 
and not playing the fan doesn't really care what happens to them.'

The family had not yet decided whether to donate Karras' brain for study, as other families have done, according to the lawyer.

Karras' wife said his quality of life had been made worse because of head injuries sustained during his playing career.

Susan
 Clark said earlier this year that her husband couldn't drive after 
loving to get behind the wheel and could no longer remember recipes 
for some of his favorite Italian and Greek dishes he used to cook.

Clark, who also played the on-screen 
wife of Karras' character on TV show Webster, said he was formally diagnosed
 with dementia several years ago and had symptoms for more than ten 
years.

She and Karras were among those who filed suit nearly six months ago in U.S. District Court in Philadelphia.

'This
 physical beating that he took as a football player has impacted his 
life, and therefore it has impacted his family life,' Clark said earlier
 this year.

'He is 
interested in making the game of football safer and hoping that other 
families of retired players will have a healthier and happier 
retirement.'

For many former football stars, life after their careers have ended is far from the glory of cheering crowds and championship titles.

Doctors from the Center for Study of Traumatic Encephalopthy at Boston University, are currently studying brain injuries in professional athletes, looking for signs of the condition linked to more than a dozen dead NFL players.

Chronic traumatic encephalopathy is associated with cognitive and behavioural problems later in life and can eventually cause dementia.

Also known as 'punch drunk syndrome', it has been most common in boxers and is associated with receiving multiple concussions.

In recent years, CTE has been shown to exist in other athletes, including professional and college football players and pro hockey stars.

Sufferers can show symptoms such as memory loss, aggression, confusion and depression which may appear within months of the trauma or decades later.

In July, Tennessee Titans' wide receiver O.J. Murdock died aged 25 after shooting himself while sitting in his car.

He became the sixth NFL star to commit suicide in the last two years.

In May 2012 Junior Seau, of the San Diego
 Chargers, died of a gunshot wound to the chest. He was found by his 
girlfriend at his home in California.

South Alabama associate head
coach Kurt Crain, who once played in the NFL, shot himself in April 
2012. He had reportedly been suffering from a severe prostate 
infection.

Also in April, Ray Easterling, a one-time Atlanta Falcons star, shot himself at home after struggling to cope with dementia.

Former Nashville Predator Wade Belak was found dead in September 2011, having hanged himself in a Toronto hotel room.

Two-time Super Bowl winner Dave Duerson shot himself in February 2011 after texting family members asking for his brain to be examined for chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a degenerative disease.

The NFL has 
said it did not intentionally seek to mislead players and has taken 
action to better protect players and to advance the science of 
concussion management and treatment.

Speaking about Karras' deteriorating 
condition yesterday, Lions president Tom Lewand said: 'The entire 
Detroit Lions family is deeply saddened to learn of the news regarding 
the condition of one of our all-time greats, Alex Karras.

'Perhaps no player in Lions history attained as much success and notoriety for what he did after his playing days as did Alex.'

Born in Gary, Indiana, Karras starred for four years at Iowa.

Detroit drafted Karras with the 10th overall pick in 1958 and he was a four-time All-Pro defensive tackle over 12 seasons with the franchise.

He was the heart of the Lions' famed 'Fearsome Foursome', terrorizing quarterbacks for years.

The Lions handed the powerful 1962 Green Bay Packers their only defeat that season, a 26-14 upset on Thanksgiving during which they harassed quarterback Bart Starr constantly.

Packers guard Jerry Kramer wrote in his diary of the 1967 season about his trepidation over having to play Karras.

'I'm thinking about him every minute,' Kramer wrote.

For all his prowess on the field, Karras may have gained more fame when he turned to acting.

Playing a not-so-bright bruiser in 
Mel Brooks' 1974 comedy Blazing Saddles, he not only slugged a horse but
 also delivered the classic line: 'Mongo only pawn in game of life.'

Several years before that, Karras had
 already become a minor celebrity through George Plimpton's 
behind-the-scenes book about what it was like to be an NFL player in the
 Motor City - Paper Lion: Confessions of a Second-string Quarterback.

That led to Karras playing himself 
alongside Alan Alda in the successful movie adaption - Karras and 
Plimpton remained friends for life and one of Karras' sons is named 
after Plimpton - and it opened doors for Karras to be an analyst 
alongside Howard Cosell and Frank Gifford on Monday Night Football.

In the 1980s, he played a sheriff in 
the comedy Porky's and became a hit on the small screen as Emmanuel 
Lewis' adoptive father, George Papadapolis, in the sitcom Webster.

Karras played his entire NFL career with the Lions before retiring in 1970 at age 35. He
 was a first-team All-Pro in 1960, 1961 and 1965, and he made the Pro 
Bowl four times.

He missed the 1963 season when he was suspended by NFL 
Commissioner Pete Rozelle in a gambling probe.

Karras was recognized by the Pro Football Hall of Fame as a defensive tackle on the All-Decade Team of the 1960s.

'We
 know Alex first and foremost as one of the cornerstones to our Fearsome
 Foursome defensive line of the 1960s and also as one of the greatest 
defensive linemen to ever play in the NFL,' Lewand added.

Alex
 Karras is survived by his wife Susan and six children - five from his 
first marriage to Joan Jurgensen and a daughter to Susan.
