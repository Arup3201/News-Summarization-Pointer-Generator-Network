While most people kill time on a commute by catching up on a book, listening to music or indulging in some Sudoku, one Japanese office worker is up to something quite different.

Seikou Yamaoka, who studied at Osaka University of Arts, uses his iPhone to create incredible finger painting portraits with the app ArtStudio.

His stunning works look like they've been painted with oil or acrylic, not with just his fingers and his Apple device.

Serene and graceful, Yamaoka's finger paintings are full of depth and atmosphere

Yamaoka, who lives in Sakai in Osaka Prefecture, Japan, has become an internet sensation for his videos.

One of his most famous clips features him creating his own version of the famous masterpiece Girl With a Pearl Earring by Dutch artist Johannes Vermeer.

The married Japanese artist creates some of his art on an iPad mini or iPod Touch while on his longÂ  journeys to work.

Yamaoka constantly zooms in and out, capturing an incredible amount of detail in his complex and beautiful digital paintings which take around three to four hours to complete.

But he doesn't shy away from the canvas. His Facebook page and YouTube channel reveals he paints actual water color portraits, too.

It's hard to believe these masterpieces have been created with fingertips on a computer screen

His work captures an incredible amount of light and controlled sharpness

Yamaoka doesn't just focus on females or even people, as animals also feature in his work

When Yamaoka started creating iPhone art, the software was more basic and he used it just to practice his drawing.

He fell in love with the technology, which was free from the constraints of traditional painting tools and needing to wait for paint to dry. He was fascinated how an iPhone allows one to be free to create art at any time and says that he is excited about the prospects for the future.

Yamaoka held his first solo watercolor iPhone art exhibition this year in Gion, Kyoto's most famous geiko (geisha) district, which saw hundreds of visitors come to marvel at his work.
