A lifeguard from Hawaii is recovering in hospital after being hit on the head by a falling coconut. 

Harold Teshima was treated in hospital for concussion and a gash to his head after the coconut fell on him in Hanauma Bay on Friday.

Mr Teshima said he was fifteen minutes from the end of his shift, helping to clean up after hurricane Ana, when he was suddenly knocked unconscious.

Lifeguard Harold Teshima was taken to hospital with concussion, a cut to his forehead and neck strain after being hit over the head by a falling coconut

He told KHON2: 'I remember feeling my forehead, feeling blood dripping down my nose. I didn’t know what was going on. So I laid down.'

Fellow lifeguards rushed to help him, and discovered a 4lb coconut, approximately the size of a softball, laying nearby.

Mr Teshima was put on to a stretcher and taken to a nearby hospital, where he was treated for concussion, a cut to his head, neck strain and nausea. 

He has since said the accident could have been prevented, as lifeguards were reporting two weeks previously that large coconuts were falling from the trees.

Mr Teshima, who says the accident could have killed him, was injured on Hanauma Bay beach on Friday while helping to clear up after Hurricane Ana

He added: 'It's a good thing it happened to me and not a child or infant. Could have been fatal. Could have been fatal to me, actually.'

A city spokesman said the trees are trimmed every six months, and were last trimmed five months before Mr Teshima was injured.

The spokesman added that workers were sent to cut the foliage back after the accident on Friday.
