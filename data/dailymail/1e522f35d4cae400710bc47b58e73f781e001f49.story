Manchester City's first team stars and management team visited Gorilla bar to celebrate Christmas ahead of the busy festive Premier League schedule.

The likes of Joe Hart, Frank Lampard and Yaya Toure were joined by Manuel Pellegrini's coaching staff at the 'relaxed and sophisticated' bar on Whitworth Street, Manchester.

Gorilla claim they 'stock the best gins from around the world and contemporary classics with a considered dedication to the martini, its predecessors and derivatives.'

Manchester City decided to hold their Christmas party at the 'relaxed and sophisticated' Gorilla bar

City's staff and players, including Samir Nasri who wore a £490 Givenchy Black Rottweiler sweatshirt, made their way into the Manchester hotspot after travelling to the venue on a team coach.

The Premier League champions decided to make use of not having a midweek fixture, due to their exit from the Capital One Cup, by going on a festive team outing.

Pellegrini's side will be hoping to close the three-point gap on Premier League leaders Chelsea during the congested festive fixtures.

City face Crystal Palace on Saturday afternoon before taking on West Brom, Burnley and Sunderland before their FA Cup encounter against Championship outfit Sheffield Wednesday on January 4.

Bacary Sagna, who attended his first City Christmas party since joining the club in the summer, has told Pellegrini he is willing to fill in at centre back for their league clash against the Eagles.

The Frenchman said: 'I have played a few times at centre back for Arsenal.

'If I have to play I will play, and always try to give 100 per cent and my best for the team.

'But hopefully he (Vincent Kompany) will be ready for (Saturday's home league clash with) Crystal Palace.'
