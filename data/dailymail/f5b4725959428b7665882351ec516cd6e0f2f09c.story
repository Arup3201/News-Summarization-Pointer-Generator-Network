A killer who murdered a woman by dousing her in white spirit and setting her alight has been told he must serve at least 27 years behind bars.

Terrence Armer, 61, was sentenced for the killing of Stacey Mackie, who suffered 95 per cent burns in the attack at her flat in Kendal, Cumbria.

A jury took less than two hours to convict Armer of murder after rejecting his claims that he loved Miss Mackie 'like a daughter' and had done nothing to hurt her.

The trial at Carlisle Crown Court heard that Armer decided to kill Miss Mackie after she spurned his advances and ended their friendship.

CCTV footage showed Armer using an axe and a screwdriver to break into Miss Mackie's flat shortly after midnight on January 27, the court was told.

Once inside, he covered in the flammable liquid and set her alight. The jury heard that she told a police officer who found her: 'I know I am going to die.'

Miss Mackie was taken to the Royal Lancaster Infirmary and later transferred to Wythenshawe Hospital, Manchester, where she died.

The trial judge, Mr Justice Irwin, said Armer had been convicted on ‘overwhelming evidence’ of a ‘truly terrible act’.

He said it was clear that Armer felt he had ‘rights’ over his victim and that he had ‘wanted more than friendship’ from her.

After she ended their friendship Armer, of Kendal, Cumbria, had formed ‘the dreadful intention’ to kill her in a way that he knew would cause her great suffering, the judge added.

The trial heard that the pair had met last winter while they were both being treated in hospital for mental health issues.

When he was interviewed by police, Armer denied attacking Miss Mackie.

He said she had been rolling a cigarette while he left her to go to the toilet and was already alight when he came out.

The judge praised the dignity of Miss Mackie’s family, who were present at court throughout the trial.

He said he hoped they would eventually realise that Armer was ‘rare in his wickedness’ and that ‘not all people’ are like him.

The police officer who led the investigation, Detective Chief Inspector Mike Forrester, said after the sentencing hearing: 'Armer inflicted an horrific attack on an innocent young woman and, today, we have seen justice served.

'Stacey’s family have been left devastated and our thoughts continue to be with them.

'Armer has shown no remorse and has consistently lied throughout his police interviews and his trial in court - despite the compelling evidence against him.

'His decision to plead not guilty meant that Stacey’s family had to go through the ordeal of a full trial where they had to relive the cruelty that led to her death.

'I hope that today’s result will help them as they try to rebuild their lives.

'I know that this case will also have a lasting effect on the police officers who went to the scene that night.

'I want to thank each and every one of them for the compassion and comfort they showed Stacey, and the commitment they have shown since to help secure this conviction.

'Fortunately, murders are exceptionally rare in Cumbria but this case demonstrates how dedicated Cumbria Constabulary and the Crown Prosecution Service are to getting justice and putting dangerous offenders behind bars.'

Peter Kelly, of the Crown Prosecution
Service, said: 'This was a terrible, shocking murder which has left 
Stacey’s family and friends devastated.

'We
may never know exactly what prompted him to go round to Stacey’s flat 
that night or exactly what happened in the flat in those few minutes 
after he arrived.

'What we do know is that he carried out a premeditated murder by deliberately pouring white spirit over her and setting fire to her.

'Through piecing together all the strands of evidence gathered by the police we have been able to prove to the jury that this is the only explanation for what happened and that he is therefore guilty of murder.

'It is difficult to imagine a more calculating and distressing crime and during the trial Stacey’s family have had to relive the harrowing circumstances of what happened.

'Despite all the overwhelming evidence against him Terrence Armer claimed the fire had nothing to do with him and protested his innocence throughout this trial.

'He made no attempt to call the emergency services on that night and has shown no remorse since.

'However, the jury have seen through his lies and brought him to justice today.

'I hope his conviction for murder will bring Stacey’s family some measure of justice and I extend my sincerest sympathies to them.'

The judge ruled Armer should serve at least 27 years in prison before being considered for parole - something the court heard was likely to be ‘academic’ in view of his age and poor state of health.
