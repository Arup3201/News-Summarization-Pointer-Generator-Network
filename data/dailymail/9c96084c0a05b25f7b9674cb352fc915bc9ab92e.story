An Islamic State commander offered to free James Foley in exchange for $750,000 but the US government refused, it has emerged.

The general was reportedly rebuffed because America refused point blank to negotiate with terrorists - and did not even want to hear the details of his offer.

A report in the New York Times also claimed that after a botched raid to free Mr Foley in July ISIS sent an envoy to Turkey to meet an American intelligence officer to discuss a deal to free him and other American hostage.

But the officer refused to even meet with him even though he was told it would 'end very badly' if he did not.

The disclosures will deepen the pain for the family of Mr Foley, who was executed by ISIS militants in August a video that was shared on social media.

They have questioned the refusal of the US government to pay ransom demands and for threatening them with prosecution if they tried to raise the money themselves, a warning they ignored.

By contrast, European governments do pay ransoms and as a result their hostages are more often returned home safely, a practice America feels encourages kidnapping.

Mr Foley is thought to have been kidnapped near the town of Taftanaz in northern Syria on Thanksgiving Day in 2012.

He was not seen again until the summer when he appeared wearing an orange jumpsuit in two videos posted online by ISIS, the first threatening to kill him and the second showing his execution.

The New York Times reported that a general who defected from the Syrian Air Force and now works with rebels in the country was approached in February by an ISIS commander because he wanted to leave the group.

The commander said that he could get to the prison in Raqqa where Mr Foley and other American and British hostages were being held.

In exchange for his assistance he wanted $750,000 and asylum in the US.

According to the New York Times, the general sent an aide with this information to the US Embassy in the Turkish capital, Ankara, but he was rebuffed.

The general said: 'They didn’t even want to hear the details; they rejected the proposal outright. The Americans just keep on saying, "We don’t negotiate with terrorists."'

The Times also reported on a separate missed opportunity to free Mr Foley a few months later.

After the failed American raid to free the hostages in July, ISIS sent an envoy called Sheikh Abdullah al-Jarrah al-Nasir to the Turkish city of Gaziantep where he met a US intelligence official they knew as Darren.

A fighter who accompanied the Sheikh said: 'I met Darren, and he came out, but he refused to meet Sheikh Abdullah.

'I told him: "The sheikh is here to negotiate." Darren blamed me and said: "We don’t meet with terrorists." 

'I told him, "If you don’t meet with ISIS and deal with them as a state, this will end very badly."

Mr Foley’s parents have openly called into question the US government’s policy of not negotiating with terrorists, which was brought in by George W Bush in 2002 in the wake of 9/11.

The presidential decree also prohibits the use of intermediaries such as Qatar, a tactic that has been used by some European countries.

In an interview on CNN after her son’s death, Diane Foley said: 'We were just told to trust that he would be freed somehow miraculously, and he wasn’t, was he.

'I pray that our government would be willing to learn from the mistakes that were made and to acknowledge that there are better ways for American citizens to be treated.'

Among the other missteps the US government made was failing to interview other hostages held with Mr Foley who had been freed and could have provided intelligence as to their whereabouts.

Relatives of Peter Kassig, a humanitarian worker who was also among the hostages, were forced to try and negotiate with ISIS on their own after the US government refused.

They sent a family friend to meet a man calling himself Sheikh Mohamed who said he was there to negotiate.

He demanded $100,000 before talks went any further - the Times reported that they would have sought a total of $20 million.

The Kassigs said that without proof of life they would not pay anything because it would involve mortgaging their house, words which enraged the sheikh.

He told the family friend: 'Tell the family they will see their proof of life on TV.'

Eleven days later Mr Kassig appeared in a video wearing an orange jumpsuit with a militant holding a knife next to his throat - and was later executed.
