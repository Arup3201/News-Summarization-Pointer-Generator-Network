Twitter, inevitably, fired the conspiracy that the Italian Grand Prix was fixed for Lewis Hamilton to win. So it was there that Mercedes scotched the idea.

They posted: ‘BREAKING NEWS: Dramatic news in the skies over Brackley as #NR6 hands #Italian GP victory to #F1 WDC rival #LH44.’ They illustrated the tweet with a picture of three pigs flying above rural Northamptonshire.

It was a neat satirical touch and supported the prevailing view of paddock observers that Rosberg merely made a mistake at the first chicane, ran off the track and unwittingly allowed team-mate Hamilton to take the lead.

Straight on: Rosberg's error on lap 29 allowed team-mate Hamilton to cruise to victory in Monza 

Charlie Whiting, the highly respected race director, has seen every bit of pit-lane chicanery during more than 40 years in the sport, but he almost choked on his orange juice in the airport lounge as he caught up with the media coverage before flying back from Monza.

A conspiracy? ‘Spare me!’ he said. ‘No, we didn’t give the conspiracy theory a moment’s thought at the time. This sort of speculation might be good for people to talk about, but if Mercedes had wanted to fix the result they wouldn’t have done it like that. They would have found a more subtle way to do it.

‘A few drivers had problems there in practice, including Nico. I really don’t think there is anything in it.’

The most obvious argument against the theory is that Rosberg would surely never have followed any instruction to let Hamilton pass. He is hell-bent on winning the world title in what he perceives as his career-defining season.

Had Mercedes ordered him to give way to make up for his part in the infamous crash with Hamilton in Spa, it is unimaginable that he would have done anything other than flatly refuse to do so.

Speaking from Ibiza in his post-race blog, Rosberg, who leads Hamilton by 22 points at the top of the championship, said: ‘Lewis was quick and I had to step up my game and tried to get that little bit extra out of it and I messed up.

‘I could have made the corner but the risk is so big that my front tyre would be square from the lock-up, so the safer way, and the best way, and the only way was to go straight on. At least I would not have to do another pit stop and change tyres.’

Monza marked the traditional end of the European season, though the Russian Grand Prix makes its debut in Sochi next month. With six races remaining, Hamilton is exuding a more positive mental state.

Can the momentum keep swinging his way after Rosberg’s purple patch? ‘Monza was a big positive and a step up the massive staircase I have to face,’ said Hamilton. ‘Time will tell how the psychological battle will go.’
