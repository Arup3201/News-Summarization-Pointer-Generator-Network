Lionel Messi has committed his future to Barcelona, ending rumours of a move to Paris Saint Germain or Chelsea.

According to the front page of Mundo Deportivo in Spain, the Argentinian superstar has confirmed he will stay at the Nou Camp for the foreseeable future.

There had been rumours circulating of a potential move away from Barca, with Chelsea and PSG said to be preparing bids, but Mundo Deportivo claim, 'Leo Messi has a total commitment to the club.'

They continue by stating that Nassir Al-Khelaifi, president of PSG, was keen on the forward, while Chelsea had also readied themselves for a high bid.

The Blues are said to have consulted not only with their midfielder Cesc Fabregas, but also his partner Daniella Semaan, about the likelihood of Messi jumping ship and moving to London.

The front page of Marca leads with a story on Sergio Ramos, with the headline, 'Nobody can stop him'. They claim the Real Madrid defender will push to start at the Mestalla on Sunday, when Madrid face Valencia in La Liga.

The other Spanish papers focus on Sergio Ramos' return from injury, and Carlo Ancelotti's hopes for 2015

'His recovery work over Christmas has paid off,' they continue.

In Italy, much of the focus is on Arsenal forward Lukas Podolski's imminent loan move to Inter Milan. The German touched down in Italy on Friday, with La Gazzetta dello Sport reporting that he had stated he was, 'Happy to be here.'

He may also play against Juventus on Tuesday - a tough first game of his spell in northern Italy.

AS in Spain lead with a story on Carlo Ancelotti. The Real Madrid boss says 'there are no limits in 2015', as Los Blancos try to emulate the success of last season.
