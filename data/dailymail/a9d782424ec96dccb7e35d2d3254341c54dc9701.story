Jamie Vardy celebrated his starring role in the defeat of Manchester United with a day out at Leicester Racecourse.

The 27-year-old, who played a part in all five of The Foxes' goals on Sunday, was joined by team-mates Chris Wood, Conrad Logan, Ritchie De Laet and Andy King.

Nigel Pearson's side completed a remarkable comeback against Louis van Gaal's side, coming from 3-1 down to win 5-3.

The defeat was the first time in Premier League history that Manchester United have surrendered a two-goal lead to lose - so few could argue that Vardy and the Leicester players deserved some time off. 

Nigel Pearson's side have enjoyed an impressive start to the season, beating United and Stoke as well as earning draws against both Arsenal and Everton. 

Next up for The Foxes is a trip to Neil Warnock's Crystal Palace, who picked up their first league victory of the season against Everton on Sunday.
