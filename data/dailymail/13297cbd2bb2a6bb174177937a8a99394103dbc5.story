A baby girl born almost three months prematurely to a mother battling terminal cancer is doing well and gaining strength in the lead-up to Christmas.

Michelle Buchholtz, 38, gave birth to Ava at just 29 weeks, in Melbourne on November 14, in a bid to help prolong her own life as she holds out hope of living long enough to take her baby home.

The mother had Ava early so she could undergo further cancer treatment as her health slowly deteriorates.

At one month old, the baby girl now weighs 1767g after being born a tiny 1kg by caesarean.

At one month old, baby Ava - who was born at 28 weeks - is doing well

She has moved out of the intensive care unit at the Royal Women's Hospital but will remain at the hospital over Christmas, while her mother also battles on after her latest round of chemo.

‘She’s giving me hope. What I’m going through with the chemotherapy isn’t that easy, but she keeps me strong, seeing her doing so well,’ Ms Buchholtz told the Herald Sun.

Ms Buchholtz gave was forced to give birth wearing a neck brace due to fractures caused by her many tumours.

'It was difficult to be totally happy initially, I was looking at her thinking "Oh My God I'm not going to be here",' she said at the time.

An update on the family's Facebook fundraising page earlier this month revealed Ava's progress 

'But when they put her on my chest a couple of days later everything sank away.’  

Ms Buchholtz and her fiancé, Alex Ansalone, have been trying to raise money for cancer treatment to buy the new family more time together.

The couple have terminated two pregnancies since they started trying for a family - once during her first fight with an aggressive stage four breast cancer in 2012. 

They stored Ms Buchholtz's eggs before she underwent chemotherapy and had a double mastectomy.

Ms Buchholtz and Mr Ansalone decided to try again for baby Ava when Ms Buchholtz thought she was finally cancer free.

But 17 weeks into the pregnancy, her cancer returned and doctors said it had spread to her spine.

In just two months, 12 new tumours have grown and spread into her neck, back, pelvis, hip and thigh.

'We've been told her prognosis is not good and there's no cure,' Mr Ansalone told the newspaper.

Ms Buchholtz, pictured here pregnant with Ava, was first diagnosed with breast cancer after the couple returned from a trip to Europe in October 2012 

'So having the baby has been the best thing at this stage. It has helped us push through.'

Ms Buchholtz was first diagnosed with breast cancer after the couple returned from a trip to Europe in October 2012. 

The tumour along with 18 lymph nodes were removed and she had a double mastectomy as a precaution.

After a blood test showed Ms Buchholtz was pregnant, the couple decided to terminate the pregnancy so she could undergo intense chemotherapy.  

The couple managed to fall pregnant naturally following the treatment, but again had to terminate in September last year after learning the child would not survive due to abnormalities.

Ava was born via caesarean weighing just 1,056 grams as Ms Buchholtz lay in the hospital bed wearing a neck brace due to fractures caused by her many tumours

In December 2013, Ms Buchholtz had  breast reconstruction surgery and was able to return to work in February.

An MRI confirmed in August that her cancer had spread to the spine.  

Ms Buchholtz is undergoing radiotherapy and another round of chemotherapy following Ava's birth.

The couple expect Ms Buchholtz's ongoing treatment to exceed $40,000 and  set up a crowd funding website to help prolong her life.

They have now raised a staggering $174,690.
