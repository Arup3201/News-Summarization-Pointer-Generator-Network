One of the most hotly anticipated events in Monaco's social calendar, the annual Rose Ball, took place in Monte-Carlo on Saturday night and provided the perfect opportunity for a host of the principality's young royals to let their hair down, while it even attracted a public appearance from Prince Albert and his wife, Princess Charlene.

The Bal de la Rose is a traditional annual charity event in aid of the Princess Grace Foundation, and this year Princess 
Caroline, the foundation’s president, had asked her friend Karl Lagerfeld to
 design the Rose Ball.

Heading up the royal entourage was 
Princess Charlene, Prince Albert, and Princess Caroline - joined by her 
fun loving children, including daughter Charlotte Casiraghi, 27, who was pictured dancing up a storm to British popstar Mika.

Charlotte was joined by her partner Gad Elmaleh and their son Raphaël. Her brother Pierre also attended the star studded bash, accompanied by his girlfriend Beatrice 
Borromeo who wore a breathtaking peach gown with a matching fur stole.
