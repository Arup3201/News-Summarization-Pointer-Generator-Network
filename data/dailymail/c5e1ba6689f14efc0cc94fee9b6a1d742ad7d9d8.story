Plans for a third runway at Heathrow have finally been scrapped after Labour joined the Coalition in ruling out an expansion at the airport.

The controversial plans, which attracted widespread criticism from environmentalists, are now 'off the agenda', despite a third runway being backed by the previous Labour government.

Activists had opposed plans for an expansion at Heathrow on the grounds of disturbance and pollution from aircraft.

Overcrowded: Although Heathrow Airport is said to be running at 98 per cent capacity, a ban has been put in place on expansion of its runways

The Shadow Transport Secretary, Maria Eagle, explained to The Guardian that the reason for Labour's U-turn on the proposed runway was due to the local environmental impact.

She said: 'The answer for the south-east is not going to be to fall back on the third runway at Heathrow... it is off the agenda.'

Transport Secretary Justine Greening confirmed the decision but denied it meant ministers are 'anti-aviation'.

And although expansion of Heathrow was ruled out, Greening would not reject outright Boris Johnson's ambitious plans to build an airport in the Thames estuary near Kent.

Speaking at an aviation conference in London, Ms Greening admitted the third runway plan 'had its share of critics', adding: 'The political reality is that the (Heathrow) runway decision has been made and it is done.

'I want to emphasise that the decision we took does not mean we are anti-aviation.

'This Transport Secretary and this Government are anything but.

'I know just how many people rely on an efficient, effective and successful Heathrow - for work and for travel. I get just how crucial aviation is to our national wellbeing - economically, socially and environmentally.

With Heathrow and Gatwick both full to capacity, ministers are keen to find a solution to ease the strain on Britain's two busiest airports.

'Heathwick' Airport rail link: Heathrow and Gatwick airports could be linked by a high-speed rail network to create the world's first 'virtual hub' airport under proposals considered last month.

Dubbed 'Heathwick', the scheme would see a £5billion high-speed rail service linking the west London site to west Sussex in 15 minutes.

Travelling at speeds of 180mph, trains would leave every five minutes and would follow the route of the M25.

'Boris Island': London mayor Boris Johnson’s revealed plans three years ago for a London airport built on artificial islands in the tidal waters of the Thames.

The 'Boris Island' transport hub would see a £40billion airport built off the Isle of Sheppey in Kent.

'And I recognise that the industry needs certainty and decision making in the long-term national interest, not chopping and changing for reasons of short-term political advantage.'

She added: 'It's time to turn the page and write a new chapter in the story of aviation. Prominent in that new chapter will be a credible, workable aviation strategy.'

Greening used the speech to airport operators to also reaffirm the government's block of new runways at Stanstead and Gatwick.

However, when asked if she ruled out a new airport hub in the south-east altogether, she said: 'No. There are a number of airports in the south-east; we have people like the mayor who has proposals for new airports.'

According to the Guardian, Ms Greening refused to rule out the Mayor of London's 'Boris Island' airport plans, adding: 'There are a number of different proposals that we have to look at... I have no doubt he will want to raise that with me.'

It emerged earlier this year that Britain's busiest airports like Heathrow are running at 98 per cent capacity.

Overcrowded skies above the UK led to planes spending a cumulative 55 hours a day circling Heathrow waiting to land.

Fuel worth £119,000 alone is wasted above London every day as planes 'stack' delaying an average of 55,800 passengers for between four and 20 minutes.

Jon Proudlove, managing director of NATS air traffic control, said in June that London was 'on a knife edge' because of the lack of runways across the city that means planes are stacked as a matter of course.

Ms Greening added: 'Sometimes it's easy to fall into the trap of thinking that strategy is all about dealing with single issues, such as capacity for example.

'I believe our aviation strategy for our country has to be far broader-based than just the capacity question, though I recognise the importance of that question. Actually, the best strategies cover all the bases.

'They're focused on the short term and the long term, the economic and the environmental, the local and the global, the needs of the sector and the needs of the passenger.'

Ms Greening said she recognised that some at the conference were in favour of a third runway at Heathrow.

She told them that the best solutions emerged 'when all sides are fully engaged and properly involved'.
