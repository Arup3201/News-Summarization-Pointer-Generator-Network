The seven-year-old girl who survived a plane crash that killed the four other passengers has been described as 'one remarkable young lady' by officials investigating the accident. 

Sailor Gutzler was the sole survivor of the plane crash in Kuttawa, Kentucky, that killed her parents, sister and cousin. She is now being looked after by her grandparents. 

Investigators hope Sailor might assist them in determining what brought the plane down. 

National Transportation Safety Board investigator Heidi Moats said: 'Having someone that is a witness (is) always helpful in the investigation, it gives us kind of a story line.'  

Sailor Gutzler, seven, walked barefoot with broken bones through thorns in the dark to find help

 'Her voice was quivering': When police arrived, Sailor was so shaken she wasn't making any sense

Using survival techniques she picked up from her father, Sailor lit a stick from the burning wreckage to fashion a makeshift torch to guide her way through the Kentucky forest 

She crossed two embankments and a river creek in darkness and near freezing temperatures, before she reached the house of Larry Wilkins, about three-quarters of a mile from the crash site. 

'I opened the door and this little girl was standing there with bloody nose, bloody legs and bloody arms,' Mr Wilkins told NBC.

'Her voice was quivering. She told me her mom and dad were dead and she was in a plane crash and the plane was upside down.

'She was bleeding pretty bad, her legs were bleeding, her face had a bloody nose. She was barefoot, only had one sock on. She asked if she could stay here,' Wilkins recalled.

He immediately called 911 and then cleaned up the bloodied girl with a washcloth.

When police arrived, the little girl was so shaken up she could hardly make herself understood.

Sailor's cousin Sierra Wilder, 14, also died in the crash and was described by her mother as 'her best friend' 

A family spokesman said: 'We are devastated by this loss, but are confident that they rest in God's loving arms.  

'We ask that you respect our privacy at this difficult time. Please pray for us, especially for Sailor Gutzler.' 

In the wake of the disaster, relatives have set up a fund to provide for the girl. 

Lieutenant Brent White of Kentucky State Police said the situation was extraordinary.  

'She literally fell out of the sky into a dark hole and didn't have anybody but her own will to live and get help for her family,' White told the Associated Press. 'Absolutely amazing.'

He told NBC: 'She's upside down in an aircraft that's crash-landed, she is in shorts and a T-shirt, she's seven years old, she has broken bones, she pulls herself out of the aircraft, she's in a place where she doesn't see any lights, she walks through thorns, briers, a 12-foot ditch, and continues to walk in that environment with no shoes on until she sees a light on in a house.'

Lt. White said emergency crews 'worked tirelessly to find this wreckage and hopefully salvage the lives of those that were on board, but ultimately it just wasn't meant to be.'

Sailor was taken to Lourdes hospital in Parducah, Kentucky for treatment and was released on Saturday morning. 

Sailor's parents Marty Gutzler, 48, and his wife Kimberly Gutzler, 46, sister Piper Gutzler, 9, and cousin Sierra Wilder, 14, all died in the crash.

They were returning from visiting Sailor's adult brother at a naval base in Florida to their home in Nashville, Illinois.

A longtime friend of the Gutzlers, Patrick Povolish, 61, told the St Louis Post Dispatch: 'This is a small community where everybody knows everybody and this will be devastating for the whole town.  

Larry Wilkins found a bloodied and distressed Sailor on his doorstep and took her in before calling 911

Mr Gutzler, who was flying the aircraft was an experienced pilot who had been piloting light aircraft since he was 16 and taught as a flight instructor. He had made the Florida to Illinois flight, 'many, many times' a family friend told NBC News.

Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) officials said that the plane had reported engine problems shortly before it lost contact with air traffic controllers just before 6pm local time. The last contact was at 1,800 feet. 

Police received a phone call from Mr Wilkins about 30 minutes after the plane lost radio contact to report the crash and Sailor's survival.
