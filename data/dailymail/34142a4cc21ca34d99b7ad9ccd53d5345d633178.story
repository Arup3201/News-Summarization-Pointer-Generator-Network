Could this be the cutest cottage in Britain? This hexagonal-shaped stone thatch looks as if it could be lived in by a Hobbit – but, in fact, the impeccably restored two-bedroom Gingerbread Cottage is a former gatehouse to the Trelowarren estate near Helston, Cornwall.

Visitors are certainly charmed by it – it’s one of the most photographed buildings in Gweek, the pretty village at the head of the Helford River in beautiful south-west Cornwall.

And such is its allure that it has been let out successfully, all year round,  as a holiday cottage. Guests have included a honeymoon couple from Austria.

Living in a fantasy world: Owner Lizzie Flint, 60, and her late husband John, completely redecorated Gingerbread Cottage in Gweek village, near Helston, Cornwall

Gingerbread Cottage’s front door leads  into a lobby and on to a cosy kitchen with slate floor, handcrafted kitchen units, table and chairs and inglenook fireplace.

The deep window recesses in the cottage reveal the thickness of the 18th Century stone walls, with some of the stonework exposed and the rest plastered and painted.

The sitting room has comfy armchairs and the new ground-floor bathroom is immaculate, with white and turquoise tiling and exposed beams in the ceiling.

Up the winding staircase from the sitting room are two pretty bedrooms under the thatch, divided by an exposed stone wall and with dramatically sloping ceilings.

A window seat with plush pink cushions makes an irresistible spot from which to  gaze through the Hobbit window above the arched front door. Outside, the gardens are surrounded by a neatly painted picket fence.

Every detail in this little Grade II listed house, from the hand-placed pieces of slate in the kitchen floor to the carefully chosen bathroom accessories,  fits so perfectly that it’s hard  to imagine it as the run-down wreck it was when owner Lizzie Flint first fell in love  with it.

She and her husband John, who lived in  the Midlands, had loved coming to Cornwall on holiday since the 1970s, and vowed they would one day move there.

They spotted that the cottage was  for sale in 2004. ‘It had been on the market for 12 months apparently, but it was such a mess that nobody wanted it,’ says Lizzie.

‘But even though it needed work, I thought it was the most perfect cottage I’d ever seen. I remember standing in the garden with a gin and tonic  once it was ours, thrilled to bits.’

Signed, sealed, delivered: The £295,000 cottage is a former gatehouse to the Trelowarren estate in Cornwall

They bought it for £32,000, and for 
the next few years travelled from the Midlands at weekends whenever they
 could, doing it up themselves a bit at  a time.

‘We
 slept on a mattress  in sleeping bags, and stuffed carrier bags in the 
cracks in the walls to keep out the wind, but we were incredibly happy,’
 says Lizzie.

John was a carpenter by trade, so was  able to do all the joinery, as well as most of the other work, calling in craftsmen only when needed.

And there was a lot to be done, including rewiring, replastering, rethatching, flooring, fitting a new kitchen and bathroom and landscaping. John spent a whole two-week holiday painstakingly repairing the beautiful arched windows.

When they finally moved to Cornwall in 2008, they had both retired, Lizzie from  her job in the police force and John from  his carpentry business.

He has just heard about the cottage: Martin Freeman as Bilbo Baggins in the latest Hobbit film

They lived in a four-bedroom house they  had also bought in a nearby village and  John spent the next ten months working his way through the cottage, getting everything finished to his and Lizzie’s high standards.

By 2009, Gingerbread Cottage was ready  to rent out – and then, tragically, John was killed in a road accident in 2010.

Now 60-year-old Lizzie has decided that it’s time for her  to move on, and is selling the cottage  for £295,000.

‘It will be a great pity to lose the cottage because it has so many special memories,’ she says. ‘John and I wanted to rescue it  and we did. I’ll always be really proud of  what we achieved.’

Claire Ray, marketing manager at Unique Home Stays, which specialises in luxury holiday properties, understands the appeal of one-off homes like this.

‘We have properties of all sizes which do very well, but the ones that do the best are the sleeps-two boltholes,’ she says.

‘People are tripping over themselves to book them and love the chance to stay somewhere unusual and romantic, immersed in luxury and seclusion.’

She knows of one ‘sleeps-two’ bolthole in Cornwall which achieved 98 per cent occupancy in a year, with a gross annual revenue in excess of £31,000.

Lizzie has certainly done everything possible to make stays at Gingerbread Cottage special. She always leaves flowers and cream teas with strawberries for guests, and for Christmas visitors she even leaves wrapped presents.

‘It’s gorgeous here at Christmas,’ she says. ‘The Gweek Silver Band marches through the village on Christmas morning and stops right outside the cottage.

‘Everyone has mulled  wine and there’s a magical  atmosphere.

‘It’s just like a scene from  a Christmas card.’
