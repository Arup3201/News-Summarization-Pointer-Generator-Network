As a supreme adventurer, he is already skilled in battling the  elements, wrestling crocodiles and eating creepy crawlies to survive.

But Bear Grylls may be about to take on his most formidable opponent – council bureaucrats.

Officials are angry after the explorer erected a long slide into the sea on his remote North Wales island without permission. They are demanding a meeting with Grylls over ‘health and safety’ concerns.

The former SAS soldier, 39, bought St Tudwal’s West, which lies around a mile off the Llyn peninsula, with his wife, Shara, for £95,000 in 2000.

Safety concerns: On Monday Mr Grylls posted this picture of 
the slide on his Twitter account saying: 'New slide attached at home on 
our island! You hit the water very fast!!!!' which then sparked the investigation

The couple, who have three sons, aged 
between four and nine, divide their time between the island, where they 
have renovated a 100-year-old former lighthouse keeper’s cottage, and 
their other home, a Dutch barge, in London.

On Monday, Grylls took to Twitter to 
say he had installed a slide on the cliffs, which rise to 80ft in 
places, for his sons to use. Alongside a picture of the metal slide, he 
said: ‘New slide attached at home on our island! You hit the water very 
fast!!!!’

TV star: Mr Grylls, who is the star of Born Survivor (pictured), has removed the slide image from Twitter. The council said the slide can only be used for two hours a day due to the tide

But the 
announcement was not received well by officers from Gwynedd Council, who
confirmed they are investigating as the 20-acre island is in an area of
outstanding natural beauty.

Councillor Wyn Williams said: ‘I have been told that the slide can only be used a couple of hours a day due to the tide.

‘However,
I don’t believe you should be allowed to erect a slide in an area of 
outstanding natural beauty such as St Tudwal’s before going through 
correct procedures.

I am concerned that an accident could happen, since 
there have been no discussions with planning or the health and safety 
department of Gwynedd Council.’

Grylls has submitted an application to 
build a £580,000 harbour at St Tudwal’s West to improve access.

Home: St Tudwals Island (pictured in the distance) is just off the Abersoch coastline in North Wales. Councillors fear there could be an accident on the slide and planning permission could be required

Beauty spot: The island, which Mr Grylls bought in 2001, is about 2,000ft long and about 650ft wide

According to the application the current jetty is ‘exposed’ and arrival and exit to the island can sometimes be ‘dangerous.’

Edward
‘Bear’ Grylls, famous for his TV series Born Survivor, became at the 
age of 23 one of the youngest people to climb Everest, but Gwynedd 
Council planning committee could prove a bigger obstacle.

‘I would presume that planning permission would be needed,’ said vice-chairman, Michael Sol Owen.
