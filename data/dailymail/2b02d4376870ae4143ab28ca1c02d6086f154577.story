Brendan Rodgers has defended Steven Gerrard’s form and fitness, insisting the veteran Liverpool captain does not need to be rested more often.

Gerrard, 34, has played every minute so far this season, including three games in a week that saw Liverpool lose to Aston Villa and West Ham in the Premier League while stumbling to a Champions League win over the Bulgarian outsiders from Ludogorets when he scored a last-minute penalty.

Rodgers and his coaching staff are understood to be concerned that in both league games Gabriel Agbonlahor and Stewart Downing were successfully deployed to stifle Gerrard and stop him distributing the ball from deep.

As a result, the former England skipper misplaced 11 passes in the West Ham half on Saturday and gave away possession 14 times.

Steven Gerrard was poor against West Ham, as his stats from the game show. Is age finally catching up with Liverpool’s 34-year-old captain?

14 Gerrard lost the ball 14 times. Only Raheem Sterling (20) lost it more for Liverpool.

11 He misplaced 11 passes in the opposition half, more than any Liverpool player.

25% Gerrard won just 25 per cent of his duels, the worst percentage of any Liverpool player.

Only six players in last year’s top six squads are older than Gerrard, and most now play bit-part roles.

Rodgers has an ideal opportunity to rest Gerrard when Liverpool entertain Middlesbrough in the Capital One cup on Tuesday, although his options have been limited by fresh injuries to Jordan Henderson and Philippe Coutinho.

Asked about his captain’s form on Monday, he said: ‘There are no concerns. He is a brilliant player for us. It was a team performance that was not up to scratch. We have managed his recovery really well in the last two seasons even when Steven was playing international football. If you look at his numbers and games it has been as good as ever.

‘He is at the age where we need to treat him individually. We want him to be involved in the big games because of his experience and we will always taper that recovery to allow him to be the best he can be.

‘We will let you know  if he will be rested. Some young players will be involved in the squad.’

Rodgers admitted  his side have started poorly and new signings like Adam Lallana need time to settle

Liverpool’s run of three defeats from five Premier League games is their second worst start to a top-flight season in 77 years. And Rodgers, who made nine signings this summer, accepts that some of them are struggling to come to terms with playing for a club like Liverpool.

‘What people probably don’t get is the pressure of playing for such a big club,’ he added. ‘The weight of the jersey here is heavy for most players. Once you adapt to playing for Liverpool you become clearer in your thinking. It’s a young group and that adjustment takes a bit of time. When you have that transition there are little bumps along the way.

‘It’s not a great start by any means but that will improve and my team will get better in the second half of the season.

‘When I first came in here we had a lot of new players coming in and at that time there was a new manager as well. We got to where we wanted to be.

‘Of course it’s not all smiles, it’s not a feeling we’ve been used to. But you have to refocus and move on. You have to be able to recover quickly at this level. It’s my job to ensure confidence is retained.

‘We want to win a trophy this season, that is still a key objective for us and this competition gives us an opportunity.’

The Anfield boss leant his support to Mario Balotelli, who was subjected to racist abuse on Sunday 

With Merseyside Police continuing to investigate allegations of racist abuse aimed at Liverpool striker Mario Balotelli after he posted a tweet mocking Manchester United’s 5-3 defeat to Leicester City on Sunday, no questions about the issue were permitted at Monday’s conference.

But Rodgers took the opportunity to back the Italian amid the first controversy of his Anfield career.

‘Every player is different,’ he said. ‘I’ve really enjoyed working with him so far. He’s a good guy, he wants to do well for the club and he’s shown he cares enough about the club to devote that time to him. For me, he’s not complicated. He’s a football player who wants to do well in his life and career. If he continues to give everything and work tirelessly for the cause there will always be an opportunity here for him.’

Former defender Daniel Agger  criticised Rodgers but the Liverpool boss has refused to respond

Meanwhile, Rodgers refused to rise to criticism from former Liverpool defender Daniel Agger who claimed on Monday that he felt unappreciated at Anfield before joining Brondby in the summer.

Agger said: ‘Let me put it this way, the manager and me were perhaps not on the same page in all of last season. For most of last season at least. I felt that he didn’t appreciate the things I contributed. When I feel that, then it’s time to move on. Where me and him maybe went wrong was that I’m very direct. I say things as they are.’
