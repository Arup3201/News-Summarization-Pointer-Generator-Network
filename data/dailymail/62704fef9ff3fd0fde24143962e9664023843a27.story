A couple who were separated from their baby for more than a year have been awarded £12,000 compensation in a landmark ruling.

The pair – who have learning difficulties and are in their 30s – will receive the payment after a judge at the High Court in London said their basic human rights had been violated by social workers.

In the first known case of its kind, family judge Clifford Bellamy told how social workers employed by Leicester City Council had dragged their feet in sorting out the case, leading to trauma for the parents.

In a landmark ruling at the High Court in London today, a judge ruled that a local council had breached a disabled couple's human rights after taking away their baby for more than a year

During the court hearing, it emerged that medical professionals had no idea the mother was pregnant before she gave birth in May last year.

The court heard that it was unclear whether she concealed her pregnancy or was genuinely unaware of it. 

The couple had not been under assessment by social workers prior to the birth. When the girl, known only as Baby H, was born Leicester City Council social workers stepped in and decided that she was ‘at risk of significant harm’. 

The couple, who cannot be named, were prevented from taking her home from hospital.

The judge said he felt great sympathy for the parents as they had ‘no one to speak up for them’.

They had no choice in the matter as their baby was put into care with a couple known to them and were then stymied in their efforts to be reunited with their daughter.

The judge said the confused parents were repeatedly ‘subjected to unnecessary delay and uncertainty’. 

The council took almost a year to launch proper care proceedings. Baby H had already celebrated her first birthday before her parents were sent on a 12-week residential course to assess their ability to look after her.

Judge Bellamy said that was the first time they had ‘been together as a family’ since her birth.

Leicester City Council, based at the city's town hall (pictured), claimed the couple were not entitled to compensation, but after fighting a High Court battle, they were ordered to pay £12,000 to the family

The child is now almost 18 months old and the couple are finally able to look after her under close supervision.

‘The happy ending must not be allowed to mask or diminish this local authority’s serious failings in the way that it dealt with this case and the impact that had on these parents,’ he said.

The judge also expressed sympathy for a foster couple who had cared for the baby. He found they had taken her into ‘their home and their hearts’ and had been given hope they would look after her permanently. 

After initially being told they would be caring for the baby for a fortnight, social workers then said she might never be returned to her parents and they became ‘deeply attached to her’.

Judge Bellamy ruled the council had admitted making 14 mistakes.

These included failing to explain to the couple why their daughter was being cared for ‘far away from them against their expressly stated wishes’. 

The council admitted that its failures breached the parents’ human rights to a fair hearing and to respect for their privacy and family life.

‘The nature and extent of the poor practice admitted by the local authority is such that an adverse impact on these parents was inevitable,’ added the judge.

‘They would have needed great fortitude to be able to take such an experience in their stride.

‘Far from having great fortitude it is clear that these are vulnerable, learning disabled parents who had no one to speak up for them.’

Despite admitting it had violated the parents’ human rights, the council argued that it was ‘inappropriate’ to award them damages.

However, the judge said that because the baby wasn’t returned to her parents until June this year; ‘These parents have suffered a loss of time with their daughter which was both unnecessarily lengthy and deeply distressing.’

He ordered that the council pay £6,000 damages to each parent, adding that this was the least required to ‘afford just satisfaction’ for what they had endured.
