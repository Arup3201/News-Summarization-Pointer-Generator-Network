Thomas Menino, Boston's longest-serving and most beloved mayor, was remembered at his funeral Monday as 'the doer of small things': a city leader less interested in the national political stage than the day-to-day minutiae of running the city.

Menino, who served as mayor from 1993 to 2014, was diagnosed with cancer shortly after leaving office.

Among those paying their respects at a procession through the city today were former president Bill Clinton, Vice President Joseph Biden, Secretary of State John Kerry, Cardinal Sean O'Malley, ex-Celtics great Bill Russell, Red Sox slugger David Ortiz and retired pitcher Pedro Martinez.

Menino's City Hall successor, Mayor Marty Walsh, opened the private ceremony at Most Precious Blood Parish in Hyde Park, where Menino was baptized and served as an altar boy, by hailing him as a 'relentless, big-hearted, people-loving urban mechanic.'

'He's has gone to fix potholes in heaven,' Walsh said to laughter.

Emotional: Clinton watches as Menino's daughter Susan Menino Fenton, left, comforts his widow, Angela Menino, as they prepare to drive through the teeming crowds of mourners and supporters holding signs

Walsh said Menino, who died on Thursday at the age of 71, 'believed in underdogs' because the former insurance salesman who rose to become mayor knew what it meant to be underestimated.

'He didn't believe in old Boston and new Boston. He believed in one Boston,' he said.

In a lengthy eulogy Governor Deval Patrick recounted how Menino did not throw his powerful political weight behind Patrick's first successful run for governor in 2006 but still spent the time to get to know the political neophyte when he sought the city leader's support.

'He seemed to make time for everyone, even a political nobody like me,' Patrick said.

The governor touched on many of the former mayor's endearing traits, including his famous tendency to mangle words and names in a thick Boston accent.

Close: John Kerry arrived in Massachusetts on Sunday for the open casket service and today's burial 

Carried out: A team of armed ushers carried the coffin out of the hearse into Hyde Park as hundreds watched

He may have mumbled, Patrick said, but 'you always knew what he meant, and that he meant what he said.'

Hundreds of dignitaries, athletes and prominent Bostonians were on hand for the service. 

Menino's casket was carried out of historic Faneuil Hall on Monday morning to the sound of bagpipes.

Thousands had come out in the cold rain as he lay in state on Sunday.

He was later buried at Fairview Cemetery in Hyde Park.

The funeral procession took him on a final tour of the city he loved, passing Boston landmarks like City Hall, the State House, Boston University and Fenway Park, as well as neighborhood locations like shopping plazas, schools and libraries that he played a role in building.

'Thank you': Governor Deval Patrick said Menino seemed to make time for everyone no matter who they were

Family: Angela Menino is accompanied by her son, Thomas Jr, and numerous prominent Bostonians

The service: Family and friends clustered into the church for the funeral service with lengthy eulogies

Hundreds of residents and supporters lined the route. Some cheered while others openly wept. Many held green signs reading 'Thank You, Mayor Menino.'

Schools along the route took children out of classes to briefly pay their respects. 'He was the education mayor. 

'This is a big part of his legacy,' said Traci Griffith, principal at Eliot School in the North End, gesturing to about 80 schoolchildren standing with her on City Hall's steps.

MaryAnne Fitzgerald, 69, who was born in South Boston and grew up in Dorchester, said it was a sad day for Boston. 

'He was a good man,' she said, standing among the crowd in front of the State House. 'He loved the city and he loved the people.' 

A liberal Democrat in a liberal Democratic city, Menino helped found Mayors Against Illegal Guns, which has stepped up its gun control campaign in the wake of the school massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut.

Prayer: Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick and Vice President Joe Biden looked on next to the coffin

Beloved: Menino will be remembered as a man who shunned everything to help the city of Boston

However, he also worked to appeal to conservative voters in East Boston and won each re-election by landslide margins of at least 15 points.

He was City Counsel President in 1993 when President Bill Clinton named Boston Mayor Raymond Flynn as US Ambassador the Vatican. Menino was named acting mayor by default.

The Boston Globe reports that a community newspaper at the time declared him 'Action Mayor Tom Menino' and Mineno liked the the misspelling so much that he vowed to live up to it.

He won the 1993 election by a landslide, becoming the city's first Italian-American to run City Hall.

In his tenure as mayor, he oversaw a remarkable transformation in Boston. He used the city's wealth of elite universities to help recruit high-tech and financial firms that brought high-paying jobs.

He oversaw the construction of gleaming skyscrapers that transformed the skyline of Boston's Back Bay.

When the developers proposed a 36-story tower next to the Prudential Tower, he vetoed the initial design and told them: 'Guys, flat roofs don’t make it.'

He then personally approved the illuminated crown design that makes 111 Huntington one of the most recognizable towers in the city.
