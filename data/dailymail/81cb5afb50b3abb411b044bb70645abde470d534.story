An Upstate New York couple say that after they complained to authorities multiple times about harassment by their neighbor - but in the end the prosecutor had them arrested, instead of him.

Paul Sohacki and Katherine Gannon claim the threatening, abusive behavior they suffered from Gene Ellis at their home in Otsego County, New York, was so bad that they started recording every interaction with him.

They both started wearing body cameras and carrying hand-held camcorders everywhere they went. They ringed their property with surveillance cameras, as well, ABC News reports. 

When they turned all of the videos over to District Attorney John Muehl and pressured them to do something about Mr Ellis - Muehl responded by arresting them for invasion of privacy instead.

Paul Sohacki and Katherine Gannon claim they were harassed by their neighbor Gene Ellis. But when they turned over video to a prosecutor, he didn't see it that way and arrested them

Not-so-neighborly: Paul Sohacki and Katherine Gannon accuse their neighbor Gene Ellis of constantly harassing them. Videos they took show that often the confrontation was mutual

Muehl told ABC's 20/20 that he took something very different away from the videos than Mr Sohacki and Ms Gannon were expecting.  

Another neighbor confirmed Mr Ellis' version of events, which helped authorities decide to pursue charges. 

'But really, if it hadn't been for this, Mr Sohacki and Ms Gannon bringing me the evidence against themselves, I wouldn’t have known, for sure, who to believe. But when I've got these videos where it’s clear that they are causing the issue,' the prosecutor said.

He added: 'I believe they are obsessed with Gene Ellis.' 

The charges were later dropped before trial.  

The couple, who moved to their 15-acre property in Otsego County several years ago, claim they were set up by Mr Ellis and his friends. 

Videos that Mr Sohacki posted on YouTube show numerous confrontations between Mr Ellis and Mr Sohacki and Ms Gannon on their shared property line. 

In on exchange, Mr Sohacki walks up to  his property line, where Mr Ellis is posting 'No Trespassing' signs.

'Real imaginative Gene, putting up no trespassing signs,' Mr Sohacki jeers. 

Mr Ellis responded: 'I want you off my land. Stop lying, you and your wife.

'You're always trying to follow me around on my own property. This is my property. I've already been here for 20-something years. You only been here for three and nobody likes you.'

The banter continues with Mr Ellis saying: 'Why can't you be a nice neighbor? I feel sorry for you. I really do.' 

Mr Sohacki responds: 'Lies roll off your tongue like it is incredible, Gene. What a frickin' liar.'

Mr Ellis, done hanging the signs, ride off saying: 'I'm praying for you, Paul. I'm really praying for you, buddy.'

In another confrontation, Mr Ellis yells that Mr Sohacki is throwing rocks at him - all while Mr Sohacki holds a camera and is clearly not throwing rocks.

Paul Sohacki and Katherine Gannon own 12 acres in Upstate New York. Mr Ellis owns 50 - and yet they both found themselves fighting on opposite side of their property line on a regular basis

And in another video, Ms Gannon says she is out planting trees on her property when Mr Ellis rides up on a tractor about 50 yards away. They start shouting at each other. Ms Gannon accuses Mr Ellis of harassing her. 

He responds by saying: 'Why don't you get a life, Katherine? Why don't you get a job, instead of recording people and invading our privacy?' 

The dispute began because Mr Ellis' driveway crosses a sliver of Mr Sohacki's property. The incident escalated into a lawsuit and Mr Ellis - who owns 50 acres - agreed to move his driveway off their property. 

However, both sides say the harassment continued for years.

Mr Ellis, who refused to talk to ABC News and could not be reached for comment by Daily Mail Online, recently moved away. 

Mr Sohacki and Ms Gannon are also preparing to move - though they say it is because Mr Sohacki got a job elsewhere in the country.
