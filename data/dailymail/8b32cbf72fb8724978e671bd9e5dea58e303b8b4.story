It's meant to be Spring Carnival’s day of glamour, refinery and sophistication.

But some of the 60,000 people who came through the gates on the third race day at Flemington were left looking a little worse for wear by the time the final horse crossed the line.

Pictures from Oaks Day on Thursday – also known as Ladies Day - have emerged showing women in their best frocks kicking back, presumably after a few too many glasses of bubbly.

On the second-last day of the annual event, fillies rolled around the floor with friends, discarded their stiletto heels and enjoyed the sunshine.

With their Smirnoff Ice cans or plastic champagne flutes in hand, they frolicked on the grass in all their finery.

Some opted to wear black outfits for the occasion. But there were also flashes of bright yellows, deep blues and eye-popping fuschias.

By the time the Oaks, the biggest race was underway at 5pm, there were embraces and affectionate hugs aplenty.

The Oaks was won by Set Square, with the owners collecting a $1 million prize.

It was the third race day of Melbourne's glorious Spring Carnival, with the last event, the Emirates Stakes Day, on Saturday.

Meanwhile, on Tuesday they Melbourne Cup race goers were also reaching for the Berocca and nursing sore heads the next day. 

At this year’s race that stopped a nation, more than 100,000 punters flocked through the gates at Flemington racecourse in Melbourne, for a day of horse racing fun, which for some was just an excuse to take a day off work, dress the part and enjoy with friends. 

As the day went on, some opted to ditch the heels and go bare foot, while others ripped off their ties and ended up taking a snooze to sleep off a hard day.

Victorian police were relatively pleased with behaviour, praising Melbourne Cup crowds, with only two people arrested and ten evicted for boozy bad behaviour.

Police said they were all for alcohol-related matters.

'They have celebrated really safely and we have had no serious incidents reported to us,' Superintendent Cindy Millen told Fairfax Radio.
