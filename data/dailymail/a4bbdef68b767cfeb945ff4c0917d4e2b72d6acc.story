But no one was willing to buy the luxurious Sydney apartment where Simon Gittany threw his fiancée fifteen floors to her death when it went to auction on Tuesday.

There was only one registered bidder for the two-bedroom property at 1503/157 Liverpool Street in Sydney, which was expected to sell for at least $2 million, despite estate agency Morton & Morton receiving plenty of interest, according to News Corp.

Gittany was found guilty of murdering Lisa Cecilia Harnum at the site and was sentenced to 26 years in prison in November 2013 in one of the most high-profile court cases in recent history.

On July 30 2011, he threw the former ballerina to her death from the 15th storey apartment. Her fiancé, 40-year-old Gittany, claimed it was suicide and that he had tried to save her life.

Just over a year after Gittany was sentenced, the apartment he had been renting with his victim was placed on the market,Fairfax reports. 

The balcony was used as one of the unit's key selling points. 

'The private covered balcony offers a superb entertaining area from which to enjoy the peaceful and unique outlook,' the advert reads.

The crime was not mentioned in the advertisement on the Morton & Morton website. 

However, the property's contract stated: 'The vendor discloses a criminal homicide occurred from the balcony of the property in July 2011 when a previous tenant occupied the property.'

Real estate agent Tolga Ozer reportedly mentioned Ms Harnum's death with one of the prospective buyers during an inspection on Saturday, according to SMH. 

'I have to inform you of an incident that occurred in this apartment... a girl fell or was thrown and hit the floor,' Tolga Ozer said according to Fairfax.

The two bedroom apartment in the heart of the city is lauded for its 'stunning outlook above the tree-tops of Hyde Park, St Marys Cathedral and beyond to dazzling Sydney harbour.'  

Apartment 1503 is described as being 'highly coveted'. It towers over Hyde Park, on the corner of bustling Elizabeth and Liverpool streets in Sydney's city.

The unit was last sold for $1.6 million in June 2010. Gittany rented the property until he was taken into custody.

Images of the property's interior and the exterior have frequently been displayed by the media and in evidence tendered in court during the three week trial.

Former tenant, 40 year old Gittany, will spend at least 18 years in prison for Ms Harnum's death, making him eligible for parole in 2033.

It was ruled that Gittany became 'apoplectic with rage' when his fiancée tried to leave him. She had a one-way ticket booked to return to her family in Canada and escape their controlling relationship.

Gittany found Miss Harnum had packed her bags and made enraged threats, according to Judge Lucy McCallum.

'I have no hesitation accepting evidence of…rage,' said Judge McCallum. 

Mere seconds before Ms Harnum toppled to her death she ran to the lift, trying to flee.

CCTV footage in the lift captured the distressing moment Gittany dragged his fiancee out of the lift by her neck.

Residents in the building told the court that they heard Ms Harnum banging on a neighbour's door, shouting: 'Please help me, help me, God help me.' 

The agent pointed out the luxury apartments 'well-appointed and stylish main bathroom, as well as internal laundry, ample storage and reverse cycle air con'

Morton & Morton point out that resident's have a 25 metre infinity pool, gymnasium, spa and sauna

The court accepted the prosecution's version of events, in which Gittany rendered Ms Harnum unconscious in the apartment after dragging her in from the lift. He then threw her off the balcony to her death.

Gittany, pleaded not guilty to murdering Miss Harnum, claiming he was trying to save her from suicide. 

He had told the court he had tried to grab her when she climbed onto the balcony but had failed to stop her falling. 

The judge did not believe Gittany's account of how Miss Harnum fell to her death, ruling that she 'found him unconvincing'.

She said Ms Harnum could not have behaved in the way Gittany said she had - clambering onto the balcony - without leaving fingerprints.

She said it was likely that Miss Harnum was rendered unconscious before she plunged to her death.  

The real estate agent wrote: 'Defined by its prized location and uninterrupted panoramic views, this luxury residence at The Hyde offers a fantastic opportunity to invest in the elite Hyde Park precinct'
