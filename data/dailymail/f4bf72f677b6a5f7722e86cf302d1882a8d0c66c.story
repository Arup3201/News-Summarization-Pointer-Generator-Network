A bullying boyfriend who made his girlfriend drink out of a dog bowl before breaking her cheek girlfriend has been jailed.

The terrified woman only escaped from the ordeal by leaping out of a third floor window as she feared for her life.

Gary Manley, 30, from Exeter, Devon, has been locked up for seven years for the attack, which left his victim, Sharon Shute, 39, in need of a hip replacement.

Manley, who has previous convictions for violence, admitted two offences of causing grievous bodily harm and one of making threats to kill.

Miss Shute had been in a relationship with Manley for two years, Exeter Crown Court heard.

The couple lived apart and on the night of the attack, he kicked in the door and lay in wait until she returned from a night out.

The bully grabbed his victim by the hair and dragged her to the floor before hitting her across the face, Mary McCarthy, prosecuting, told the court.

The serial beater forced Miss Shute to drink out of her dogâ€™s water bowl and punched her so hard he shattered her cheek bone.

He then grabbed his girlfriend's throat and threatened to kill her, Exeter Crown Court heard.

Miss Shute jumped 25 feet out of the window in fear of her life when Manley went into the kitchen to fetch a knife.

She landed on a concrete path and suffered a shattered hip and an arm which was broken so severely a piece of bone was sticking out.

Manley pursued her downstairs and thrust a 14 inch knife into her injured hand before telling neighbours she had tried to stab him.

Judge Francis Gilbert, QC, passed sentence after watching a police DVD in which Miss Shute told how she was still in agony and walking with a limp one year after the attack.

Manley has a history of domestic violence dating back to his teens and has been jailed previously for attacking two former lovers.

The judge told Manley: 'You attacked Sharon Shute in her own home. You punched her in the face, grabbed her hair, dragged her about the flat and said you were going to kill her.'

'When you went to the kitchen she thought you had gone to fetch a knife and carry out that threat and she therefore jumped from a third floor window to escape.'

'Neighbours found her on the ground very seriously injured with multiple fractures of her face, left arm, thigh and hip. Her cheek bone had been shattered by you.'

'You went with a 14 inch knife which you placed in her injured left hand and told the neighbours she had stabbed you and so you had punched her in the face.'

'You have left her with very serious scarring and disablement, as was apparent from the DVD of her victim impact statement.'

'You have a bad record of violence and have been identified as posing a high risk to others.'
