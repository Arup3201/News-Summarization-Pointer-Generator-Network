It looks like a cat, but certainly doesn't purr like a kitten.

This amusing footage reveals how a moggy, who is peacefully curled up in a ball trying to sleep, reacts adorably to his owner's coughs.

Each time the man makes a sound, bizarrely, the cat quacks in response. 

Awake: The cat appears to be more awake after the quaking and coughing noises

The gray fur-ball responds the same way several times, before finally opening his eyes and burying his head under his paw.

'This happens almost every time the cat sleeps or rests,' owner and Rumble user pavelsutryin said.

'He responds in the same way to sneezing.

'And no, I do not pull his tail behind the scenes!'  

Sleeping: The cat has an unusual habit of making a quaking sound in response to his owner's cough

Noise: The cat makes the quack sound just moments after its owner coughs
