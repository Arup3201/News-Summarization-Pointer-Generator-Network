When a puppy suddenly keeled over after being stung by a bee, its owners began to panic.

But luckily their daughter, a 20-year-old nursery worker, knew exactly what to do.

Emma Harris realised that seven-month-old boxer Lola had suffered an allergic reaction and swung into action.

Determined to bring the family pet back from the dead, she started performing CPR.

Angel of mercy: Emma Harris with her dog Lola, who she saved with CPR after the seven month old boxer suffered an extreme allergic reaction when she was stung by a bee

Recalling the moments after Lola 
swallowed the bee and was stung,  Miss Harris said: ‘She seemed fine at 
first and then five minutes later she was sick.

‘After she collapsed we couldn’t feel a 
pulse. My dad was shouting, “She’s gone, she’s gone”. My mum was a mess 
and my dad didn’t know what to do. I don’t know what came over me but I 
jumped on top of her and started to pump her heart with my fists to give
her CPR.’

Neighbour Jim Ness, a retired nurse, saw the family’s distress and leapt over the fence to help save Lola.

After a few minutes the dog was revived, choking for breath, and was taken to be examined by a vet. 
‘I needed to keep pumping her chest for a good couple of minutes,’ Miss Harris said at the family home in Plymouth.

‘Jim helped me to keep calm and held Lola’s head for me while I pressed on her chest.

‘When she started to breathe again he told me to take a rest. I had just
given 60 compressions in a row and he said that I might have to give 
her more.’

Relief: Emma Harris with her Lola and her parents Ian and Tammy. The family lost a pet dog last year and were overjoyed when Emma revived Lola

The vet gave Lola steroids to help counteract the bee sting, and she was soon back to her usual adventurous self.

Her relieved owner said: ‘If I hadn’t taken part in a first aid course at work then I wouldn’t have known what to do.

‘I am quite proud of myself for doing it. She’s my pet and she’s only 
young. We lost a dog last June, another boxer called Stella, so it would
have been horrible to lose Lola so quickly.’

Emma’s grandmother Shirley Ball, 66, said: ‘Her mother told me that Emma just told them to go away and let her get on with it.

‘The circumstances could have been very different if she hadn’t decided to act. I’m just so proud of her right now.’
