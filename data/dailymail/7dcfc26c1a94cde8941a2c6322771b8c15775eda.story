Joan Rivers has shared a sneaky selfie that she took with an unknowing Eliot Spitzer in an airplane lounge.

The comedienne posted a photo on her Twitter account on Thursday that shows she is standing feet away from the disgraced former New York governor.

'In the airport lounge. Eliot Spitzer in the red shirt behind me. Didn't recognize him with his pants on,' she wrote, poking fun of the prostitution scandal that led to his resignation.

Familiar faces: Joan Rivers posted this photo on Thursday and considering how she tried to be stealth while taking the photo, it seems unlikely that she went on to chat with the disgraced governor afterwards

Rivers' spokeswoman Judy Katz confirmed to MailOnline that the run-in took place at JFK on Friday morning.

It seems unlikely that they chatted given the stealth nature of her photo.

Rivers, who most recently identified as a Republican during a January interview, is known for her barbed critiques of fashion so it comes as no surprise that she used his clothing as a way into an insult.

Spitzer has been seen on a regular basis in recent months after his relationship with his former campaign manager Lis Smith was revealed, leading to his formal split from his wife Silda.

Spitzer, 54, and Smith, 31, were photographed sneaking into her SoHo apartment before he filed for divorce and then were later seen visiting her mother on Christmas.

More interested in each other: Eliot Spitzer and his girlfriend Lis Smith attended their third Knicks game in as many months on Monday (pictured) as they watched the home team play the Philadelphia 76ers

They have since put their relationship on even more public display by attending a number of Knicks games at Madison Square Garden over the past two months.

For her part, Rivers isn't above using a photo stunt to help generate some publicity.

She mysteriously stormed out of a QVC pre-Oscars party with her face covered in cake.

It was revealed later that Miss Piggy, the Muppet, was behind the gag as the two got into a staged fight over their competing lines that landed the 80-year-old comedienne in a strategically placed wedding cake.

Rivers has carried the feud over to Twitter.

Christie's auction house just announced that they will be selling a lot of furniture, fine art and decorative objects from Rivers' country home in Connecticut.

She sold the 760-acre estate for $4.4million last year and now she is unloading more than 150 items that once filled the house.

An unspecified portion of the sale, which will take place on April 1 and 2nd, will be donated to God's Love We Deliver, a charity that provides meals for homebound and ill New Yorkers.
