A woman has made a miraculous escape after a 12-foot-long shark bit her hand and tried to drag her out to sea.

Mckenzie Clark, 34, was surfing in North Kohala, Hawaii, on Friday morning when the shark launched out of the sea and clamped down on her left hand.

Her friend Brian Wargo turned back to see the shark lifting her up out of the water on her board as it wildly lunged at her body.

'I was just scared. I didn't know what to do. The first time it bumped me I thought, "What's happening? Did I hit a rock?" I was kind of in disbelief. It just happened so fast,' Clark told Hawaii News Now.

It pulled Miss Clark off her board and bit her hand, which she ripped back, tearing off the skin.

Mr Wargo grabbed the shark's dorsal fin and punched the beast five times in the nose.

After the fifth strike, it turned away and disappeared under the water.

Danger: Signs have now been erected around the shore in North Kohala warning passers-by of sharks

They rushed to hospital where Miss Clark received two stitches.

She is now awaiting a skin graft operation to fully repair the damage. 

The board was left with three rows of tooth marks.
