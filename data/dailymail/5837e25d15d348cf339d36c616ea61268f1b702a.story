Chains such as Pizza Express are stealing business from more formal restaurants, market research shows

Families have helped drive up the popularity of casual dining – where they can enjoy both speedy service and a restaurant atmosphere, say researchers.

But the rise of chains such as Nando’s and Pizza Express, which typify the casual dining experience, has come at the expense of more formal eating out.

Market research firm NPD Group found that casual dining has increased annual traffic by 11.6 per cent compared with five years ago.

NPD said the rise equated to 47million more restaurant visits.

Quick-service restaurants, including fast food outlets, coffee shops and bakeries, recorded 4.2 per cent traffic growth. Full service restaurants, however, have seen traffic fall by 11.4 per cent.

Families account for more than a third of casual dining visits but only a quarter overall.

With an average bill per visit in a casual 
dining restaurant standing at £11.90 for a dinner - only slightly more 
affordable than the full service where bills average £15.17 - NPD said price was not the only appeal.

They said: ‘People tell us that casual dining is the best of both worlds – speed and a good ambience.

'We believe casual dining restaurants will continue to take business from full service restaurants.’

Among the chains in NPD’s casual category are Café Rouge, Café Uno, Garfunkels, Harry Ramsden’s, Nando’s, Pizza Express, Pizza Hut, TGI Fridays and Prezzo. 

The findings also show Britons see casual dining as a good family option when eating out.

Firm NPD Group found casual dining had increased annual traffic by 11.6 per cent but full service restaurants had seen traffic fall by 11.4 per cent

At dinner time, 36 per cent of all the meal occasions in casual dining restaurants are due to family visits, whereas they only account for 25 per cent of the meal occasions in restaurants generally.

The casual dining sector remains small, accounting for only 4 per cent of Britain's total foodservice market, which generates 11 billion visits annually.

But The NPD Group said further growth was likely. Casual dining visits in Britain grew 1.5 per cent in the year ending March 2014, while fast food restaurants grew 0.6 per cent.
