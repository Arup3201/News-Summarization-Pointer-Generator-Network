While many couples will choose to honour their love by getting tattoos that symbolise their commitment, it's not often that friends and family will choose to join in the fun.

When Marlee and Jordan Follman decided to tie to knot after five years together, they set out to start their life as husband and wife in a manner distinctly their own, leaving their mark on each other- and their wedding guests.

The young couple, from Brisbane, hired a mobile tattoo van for their reception, commissioned a set of custom designs, and celebrated their nuptials by getting matching tattoos- along with 15 of their loved ones.

'Both Jordan and I had tattoos before we met each other, and have covered ourselves more since then so it was really a part of ourselves,' Marlee told Daily Mail Australia.

The pair, who met while they were studying at university, wanted to celebrate their love in a public way that was fun and unique to them, and decided to pull out all the stops to make sure their wedding reflected that. 

'After four years together we went out to dinner, and were just talking about our future plans and marriage came up,' Marlee said.

'I asked if Jordan could see us getting married one day and he said he would want to, the conversation turned to - well if that's what we want to do, why don't we do it next year?,' she said.

'We settled on a date and that was that! After a high-5, we finished dinner and walked back to the car. I remember saying - are we really going to do this? And Jordan said, yeah why not? We both want to, let's just do it.'

'Our ceremony was beautiful, my Dad and our dog Pinto walked me down the aisle,' said Marlee

Marlee and Jordan wrote their own vows to read at the wedding, and they ended up being very similar

'We wanted our wedding to reflect us as people - and to show our love for each other, and we look back on it knowing we achieved that,' Marlee said

From there, the couple collaborated on all the details of their wedding, including Marlee's hair colour, which she dyed to a vibrant purple, the colour it was when they first met, to 'pay tribute to the 'us' that was back then'.

After a few hiccups, including a change of wedding venue six months out, rescheduling the date to lock down their wedding celebrant, and a bout of food poisoning two nights before the wedding, Marlee and Jordan were ready to say their 'I do's'.

The morning of the wedding, Marlee and Jordan headed down to Officeworks in their pyjamas and then split up to prepare for the evening's ceremony.

'I had my mum and my two sister-in-laws and my bestie with me, we just sat around talking laughing and working on origami cranes for the wedding- these were all filled with handwritten notes to every guest, from me, a personal party favor,' Marlee said.

After Marlee was in her wedding dress, she and photographer Jess Jackson went down to meet Jordan for the 'first look' as she stepped out of the elevator of her hotel. 

'It was so nerve wracking and exciting. When we were waiting for the lift another guy was there waiting, and Jess asked if he would mind if we got in there alone - and sort of pointed to me and said it was my wedding day,' Marlee said.

'The guy said, "Yeah, I would mind, I'm going to work". I just couldn't stop laughing,' she said.

'It was nice to be brought back down to Earth and remember that even though it was our special day - the world keeps turning for everyone else.'

Marlee and Jordan chose their celebrant, Paul Vogue, because they knew he would understand what they wanted their wedding to look like.  

'It was important to us that we had someone like Paul, who knew legally what needed to happen in the wedding - but considered that to be somewhat boring - what else can be done in the ceremony?' Marlee said.

'He encouraged us to be creative, and to most importantly, be ourselves.'  

'Our ceremony was beautiful, my Dad and our dog Pinto walked me down the aisle, and Jordan's brothers and my brother stood beside us. Our vows were a surprise to each other - and ended up being remarkably similar,' Marlee said.

'I had been crying on and off all day - just nervous and excited for everything, but managed to feel completely confident during our vows. Jordan was the one who ended up crying - it was the first time I've ever seen him cry,' she said.  

After the couple had said their vows, they headed outside for one of the most unique elements of the wedding- the signing of the registry while getting matching tattoos.

15 of the couple's guests decided to get tattooed on the night, which Marlee said was a surprise

'My Mum even got a massive tattoo. It was such a surprise as she has never really liked them,' Marlee said

'Jordan and I wanted to get matching swans with a love heart. There's no real deep an meaningful reason for them, just a design I really liked and something that was a bit of a mystery to people when they see it,' Marlee said.

'We wanted a tattoo van there because we thought it was an awesome way to celebrate.'

Marlee enlisted the services of one of her good friends, Luke Bishop, who owns and operates Bishop's Mobile Tattooing, with the inspiration for allowing their guests to join in the inking. 

'When we approached him with the idea he thought it was awesome, and drew a flash sheet of 'love' images people could select from to get tattooed,' Marlee said.

15 of the couple's guests decided to get tattooed on the night, which Marlee said was a surprise. 

'A lot of our family are more conventional and conservative than we are, so we weren't sure if they'd join in with getting tattooed or really like the idea, but we had discussed it and knew we wanted it - so we weren't worried,' Marlee said.

'My Mum even got a massive tattoo. It was such a surprise as she has never really liked them, but she was feeling the love that day so she got her husband's name, and her two kids. It was awesome,' she said.

'It's special to know you have people in your life who love you enough to get a tattoo,' Marlee said

'The whole weekend of festivities was unique to us - we were surrounded by friends and family who were loving and supportive,' Marlee said

'It's special to know you have people in your life who love you enough to get a tattoo - and even though it was to celebrate a love in their own lives - it's cool to know they will always remember our wedding as a part of that tattoo.' 

Marlee and Jordan also chose to leave their mark on one another in a different way, combining their last names to start a new family line.

Marlee, whose last name was Wiseman and Jordan, whose last name was Follett, melded their  surnames, and officially became Mr and Mrs Follman.

'We wanted our wedding to reflect us as people - and to show our love for each other, and we look back on it knowing we achieved that, and that the hard work we both put in to make it happen really paid off,' Marlee said.

'The whole weekend of festivities was unique to us - we were surrounded by friends and family who were loving and supportive, they were open minded enough to accept what we wanted to do - and they laughed at our jokes and references even if they didn't get it,' she said.
