The biological Thai mother of baby Gammy and his twin sister Pipah has revealed she hopes to travel to Australia to see the baby girl who has remained under the care of David and Wendy Farnell.

Pattharamon Janbua told the Sun Herald that she cannot stop thinking about Pipah, originally named Paiparee, since giving birth to the children after agreeing to act as the Australian couple's surrogate mother.

'Every day I look at Gammy and see Pipah in his eyes,' she told the Sun Herald.

'I just want to hug Pipah againâ€¦ I miss her a lot every day.'

Ms Janbua was left with now nine-month-old Gammy, who was diagnosed with Down syndrome and suffers from a heart condition, when the Farnells left him behind and took only his healthy sister home with them to West Australia.

The story led to mass public outcry and a reshaping of surrogacy laws, particularly following revelations that Mr Farnell was formerly convicted for paedophilia.

The 21-year-old says she has no intention of taking Pipah for herself, but simply misses her biological child

Despite this, Ms Janbua told the Sun Herald that she has no intention of claiming Pipah for herself.

'I'll be very happy for Pipah if they love and take care of her. I will not destroy the family's happiness,' she said.

Ms Janbua did however mention that she would take the little girl under her care if Mr and Mrs Farnell were deemed unsuitable guardians by Australian authorities.

Until then, the 21-year-old said she would continue to work and save money for her trip to Australia, which she revealed she would not risk bringing Gammy to in case she was unable to bring him home again.

Her fear comes a month after the Farnells claimed they missed their son in an interview with 60 Minutes, saying 'we want to get our son back'.

According to Thai surrogacy laws however, baby Gammy's surrogate mother can not be forced to give up custody as Thai civil law states that the birth mother is his legal mother and that both children were both born Thai citizens.
