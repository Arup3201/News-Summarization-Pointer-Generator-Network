This is the moment a disgusted takeaway customer caught a chef washing his feet in a kitchen sink.

The picture, which appears to show a chef next to a food preparation area, was taken at the Neel Akash Indian and Bangladeshi Restaurant in Salisbury, Wiltshire.

According to the restaurant owner the incident happened because the chef had dropped hot oil on his foot and needed to cool the area down.

Putting his foot in it: A customer at the Neel Akash Indian and Bangladeshi Restaurant in Salisbury, Wiltshire, took this picture of a chef at the restaurant washing his feet in the kitchen sink

The restaurant has a five star rating from the Food Standards Agency (FSA) - the highest rating possible. 

The diner, who has asked not to be named for fear of reprisal, said: 'When I saw this chef washing his feet in the kitchen I felt sick to my stomach instantly.

'The only thing that I could think about was that nobody would believe me so I must get proof - hence the grainy photo.

'This is a restaurant I've eaten from many times, so I was totally shocked and upset. I will never step foot in there again.

'This is quite a popular takeaway in the area with people travelling from all over the rural surrounding villages to collect a curry.

'I used to really like the place, I just don't understand now how a five-star FSA rating was achieved.'

Restaurant owner Mohammed Shajahan, said it was an isolated incident and was not reflective of their consistently impeccable food hygiene standards.

He said:'The only reason the employee had his foot in the sink is because he had dropped hot oil on his foot and quickly needed to cool the area down in order to stop it from becoming a severe burn.

'After the member of public sent me this picture I immediately apologised to him and asked the staff member why they had broken the health and safety rules.

'After the incident happened the member of staff was asked to hand in his resignation and has now left my restaurant.

'This type of incident will never happen again.'

A spokesperson for the FSA said: 'We cannot comment on individual cases.

'However, food hygiene must be the priority for all food business operators and if any person has concerns about an individual business then they should report these to their local environmental health team.'
