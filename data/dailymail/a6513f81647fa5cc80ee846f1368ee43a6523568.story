This is the touching moment that dozens of strangers embraced a blindfolded Muslim man who has been wrongly labelled a terrorist.

More than 20 people wrapped their arms around Mustafa Mawla as he stood on the streets of Toronto, Canada, and asked for hugs.

He had two signs at his feet reading, 'I am a Muslim.I am labelled as a terrorist,' and 'I trust you. Do you trust me? Give me a hug.'  

The social experiment, filmed by Time Vision, aimed to eliminate the stereotypes surrounding Muslims.

The group were taking part in a social experiment aimed at spreading awareness of islamophobia

During the three minute clip one man is seen jumping out of a passing car just to hug Mr Mawla.

Others are captured in the short video walking past, whilst some people stop and take photographs.

At the outset of the video Assma Galuta said: 'We are conducting a social experiment to address the rise of Islamaphobia in north America and Europe and show are own community how Muslims are made to feel in their own country.

'Are message is to the world is that we wish to break down the barriers and eliminate the fear and ignorance that is projected towards Muslims and Islam and to make a difference to eliminate stereotypes and Islamophobia.' 

After conducting the experiment she described the results as 'touching' and 'inspiring.'

'The purpose of the blindfold was for him to give complete trust,' she reportedly told the Huffington Post.

'To show Canadian society that he feels like he's a part of the community.

'Blindfolded, anyone could harm him or feel very angered. 

'He's giving people his full trust and he wants to see if people trust him enough to give him a hug.'

The video, posted last week has been viewed more than 700,000 times.
