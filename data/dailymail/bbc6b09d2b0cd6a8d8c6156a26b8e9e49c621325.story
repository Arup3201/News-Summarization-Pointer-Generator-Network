Gary Anderson is confident he will dethrone world champion Michael van Gerwen on Saturday night— and avenge his two major defeats at the hands of the world No 1.

Anderson faces a formidable test against the defending champion from Holland in the best-of-11-set semi-final of the William Hill World Darts Championship at Alexandra Palace.

During the 2014 tournament, the 44-year-old Scot lost 4-3 to Van Gerwen in the last 16 — despite leading 3-1 at one stage in a titanic encounter. Back in May, Anderson experienced a last-leg defeat in the semi-finals of the Premier League play-offs at the O2 Arena.

But, in spite of the formbook, Anderson believes he can turn the tables tonight. If he does, he will reach his second world final.

The No 4 seed said: ‘I’m enjoying my darts at the moment — and I will certainly enjoy my next match.

‘I know I can score as good as Michael. If I didn’t believe that, then I wouldn’t be sitting here — it’s as simple as that.

‘You all talk about Michael. Well, I’m looking to Phil Taylor (in a potential final), not Michael.’

Van Gerwen is equally bullish about his chances. ‘You can say whatever you want but it doesn’t count. You need to do it when it’s prime time,’ he said.

Anderson produced a dominant 5-1 victory over Wright to book a place in the semi-finals of the Championships
