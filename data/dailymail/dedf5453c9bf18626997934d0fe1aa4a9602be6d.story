Twitter has become a mecca of #anger and #profanity since launching in 2006.

Now a website has been created that shows, in real time, exactly who and where drops the 'f bomb' on the social network giant.

And it should come at no great surprise that, in the United States, New Yorkers and other east coast residents appear to be the worst offenders.

FBomb.co is an interactive map that drops a pin with a warning sign at any place in the world where a potty-mouthed Tweet is posted.

Users can click on the pins, which show the vulgar Tweet and the handle that wrote it.

It's the brainchild of Martin Gingras, a junior at Carleton University in Ottawa and aspiring software designer.

Care to take a guess which side of the States likes to swear more? A new website tracks every Tweet in the world that uses the 'f word' and maps it online in real time

Bigger picture: This map, generated over about two hours on FBomb.co, shows the greatest volume of vulgar Tweets originating in the US and the UK

Show some manners: The English are not shy in using the 'f bomb' online, it would appear

Gingras said he developed the site by pulling from the public Twitter API and using geocoded date to plot a bomb signpost.

'The concept behind the application is to plot tweets containing the F word on a Google map,' he wrote on the site.

Understandably, the most foul-mouthed countries are those with English-speaking populations.

The U.S. and Britain are registering the most unrefined Twitter uses.

Canada and Australia, for whatever reason, appear to swear a lot less.

Creator: College junior Martin Gingras is an aspiring software designer

An accompany Twitter feed 'sporadically retweets the messages that make up the map.

The timing of the tweets is what is interesting most people who log onto FBomb.co.

Humorously, the concentration hits at peak in the late afternoon.

To put this in perspective, a 2010 Northeastern University study found that weekdays between the hours of noon and 6pm were the most miserable for the U.S.

Typical Tweet: Swearing in the designated 140 characters has become the norm on Twitter, with users using the site to vent their anger and feelings

At 5.45pm today, this Tweet was posted on the east coast by '@joogfac'.

'The fact that people actually tweet about getting drunk every night and smoking weed... Grow the f--- up. #NoOneCares #Pathetic.'
