Rugby star Alesana Tuilagi has escaped a jail term after pleading guilty to a drink-fuelled attack on a reveller outside a Dublin nightclub three years ago.

The Samoan winger, who is the brother of England star Manu, paid the victim around £30,000 several months ago.

Tuilagi had been out drinking after his then club Leicester Tigers lost to Leinster in a European Cup quarter-final and punched the man in what his defence lawyer described as a ‘pent-up lapse of judgement.’

Alesana Tuilagi has escaped a one-year jail sentence for an assault in Dublin back in April 2011

Tuilagi was playing for Leicester Tigers at the time and was drinking after a defeat to Leinster in April 2011

The 33-year-old, who now plays for Newcastle Falcons, pleaded guilty at Dublin District Court to assault causing harm following the incident on Harcourt Street on April 4, 2011.

Judge Anthony Halpin struck the case out, saying Tuilagi could face trouble travelling if convicted. He noted that the victim suffered no lasting damage from the punch and ‘was more than generously compensated.’

His verdict spared Tuilagi a possible one-year jail sentence and a criminal record.
