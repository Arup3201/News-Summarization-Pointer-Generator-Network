It is a stunning sunset - and heralds that for Antarctica, winter really is coming. 

 Antarctica is moving from 24-hour daylight to the 24-hour darkness of winter. 

In between there is a brief period where the sun does set and rise - and this is the first sunset of 2015.

The British Antarctic Survey research station on the Brunt ice shelf witnesses this year’s first sunset over Antarctica

Called Halley VI, it is made up of four-legged modules linked by enclosed walkways. 

The centre is designed to house between 16 and 52 members of staff, depending on the time of year. 

A central social hub gives residents the chance to relax and contains a dining room, bar and a gym.

For the crew of the French–Italian Halley research station in Antarctica, it means isolation is coming. 

They are about to be 'locked in' - and will have to survive six months of complete isolation.

To make things worse, four months will be in darkness because the Sun never rises above the horizon.

A vacuum drainage system keeps water 
consumption down, and the ski-clad stilts keep the units about 4 metres 
(13 feet) above the level of the ice. 

The inside of the centre has been 
been specially designed to support crew numbers ranging from 52 in the 
summer to 16 during the three months of total darkness in winter, when 
temperatures at the base drop as low as -56C.

It has triple-glazed windows and a 
quiet room at the north end of the station is included for residents to 
contemplate the Antarctic environment in peace.

This year, ESA-sponsored medical doctor Beth Healey will monitor five experiments that are helping to prepare for long-duration missions to explore our Solar System. 

'Living in Concordia is similar in many ways to living in space, where crew are cut off from the world without normal sunlight and live in reduced pressure – Concordia station lies 3200 m above sea level,' says the European Space Agency.

'From searching for life that could survive in these extreme conditions to monitoring how the crew of 13 interact and cope with living in close quarters, Beth will have her hands full as the crew maintain the station and perform Antarctic science for the French and Italian polar institutes.'  

Called Halley VI, the lab is made up of four-legged modules linked by enclosed walkways.

ESA signed an agreement this month with the British Antarctic Survey to perform two of the five Concordia experiments at their Halley VI station. 

If this pilot season runs well, ESA will extend the cooperation.

Concordia offers ESA scientists a place to investigate how humans adapt to living in isolation and at high altitudes. 

The crew at Halley experience the same isolation and lack of daylight but live at sea level. 

Performing the same investigations at Halley will allow researchers to cross one factor off the list that might influence data: air pressure. 

Over the next six months, volunteers at Halley and Concordia will record themselves in a video diary and have their social interactions monitored. 

This is working towards objective computer software that will give clues to an astronaut’s state of mind.

Ask anybody how they feel and most will reply ‘fine’ but, for mission controllers planning a complex spacewalk or spacecraft docking, having an objective second-opinion could be a lifesaver.

The system works by analysing small changes in intonation and grammar, as well as charting how often people talk to each other, to develop an idea of how people feel.

The second experiment being run at both sites will test how our eyes adapt to four months of outside darkness and artificial lighting.

David Vaughan, British Antarctic Survey’s director of science, concludes: “We are committed to supporting excellent science in Antarctica in all disciplines. We are hugely excited to be hosting these new experiments that may help prepare for, perhaps, the biggest adventure in history, a manned flight to Mars.”

During winter the Sun stays below the horizon for around four months. A skeleton crew of up to 15 to keep the base running and fend for themselves for nine months.

It was built solely for purpose, to enable scientists to live comfortably as they carry out vital research work in the freezing cold Antarctic.

But thanks to its strikingly futuristic appearance, the Halley VI centre has been causing quite a stir in architectural circles, and it has now been nominated for a prestigious global award. 

In a textbook example of form following function, British architect firm Hugh Broughton 
created the series of four-legged pods, seven of them blue and one red, 
which stand on moving ice and can be raised to keep them above the snow 
which builds up.

The dismantlable research station, 
which few fans of design will ever get to see unless they venture to the
 Antarctic wilderness, is among the nominees for the World Architecture 
Festival Awards 2013.

Halley VI is the sixth facility to occupy the site on the Brunt Ice Shelf - a floating sheet of ice about 10 miles (16 kilometres) from the edge of the South Atlantic.

Most of the previous stations were crushed under the weight of the polar snow, while Halley V had to be abandoned due to fears that the station would be lost if the ice sheet split apart, said survey spokesman Paul Seagrove.

remote location means the scientists have been able to see the stunning 
aurora australis

Home from home: The modules include house labs, a dining room, a bar and a gym

Linked: The scientists do not need to go outside to move between modules as they will be joined together by walkways
