WIGGINS TO GET GB BACK ON TRACK

Bradley Wiggins can fill the leadership void in British track cycling, according to the man who now runs the sport.

The home nations won just two gold track medals combined this Games, and British cycling technical director Shane Sutton admitted Team GB lacks leaders.

On Wiggins’ decision to focus on Team GB, Sutton said: ‘It’s a massive boost. You need those big leaders and I think Sir Bradley coming back has given everyone a lift.

Silver lining: Wiggins won his forth Commonwealth silver medal in the 4000m Men's Team Pursuit final

Northern Ireland’s Michael Conlan made the bantamweight quarter-finals by beating India’s Shiva Thapa.

The 22-year-old was clearly punching above his weight when he took part in Ireland’s Celebrity Apprentice in 2013, though. He was fired in the third week after leading his team to a €10,000 loss.

England had to settle for silver in the men’s team table tennis, losing 3-1 to holders Singapore in a repeat of the Delhi 2010 final.

Singapore took a 2-0 lead as Jian Zhan and Ning Gao beat Paul Drinkhall and Liam Pitchford respectively.

Drinkhall and Andrew Baggaley halved the deficit by dispatching Ho Li and Ning Gao in the doubles, but the result was confirmed when Zhan beat Baggaley in the singles.

AUSSIES STICK IT TO ENGLAND

England’s women were humbled 3-0 in the hockey by Australia, ending hopes of finishing top of their pool. Australia take their record to four wins from four - scoring 25 goals and conceding zero.

Meanwhile, Scotland won 2-0 against Wales - a welcome result after their 9-0 thrashing by Australia. Not even Xenna Hughes, the daughter of Stoke boss Mark, could save Wales from a third defeat.

Humbled: Australia cruised to a 3-0 victory over England's Women's hockey team for a forth straight win

It was a disastrous decathlon for Australia’s Jack Stein. The 20-year-old made two false starts in the first event - the 100m - meaning he was disqualified, therefore scoring no points and ending his medal hopes before the first starting gun had been fired.

Two-time Games champion Denise Lewis had little sympathy for Stein: ‘Two false starts is unbelievable, you have nine events to go,’ she said. ‘I’m sorry for him, but you have to have discipline.’

MICK MISSES OUT WITH FINAL SHOT

Veteran shooter Mick Gault OBE stowed his air pistol for the last time on Monday, after failing to qualify for the final of the 50m pistol event.

The  60-year-old from Norwich came out of retirement for these Games, and equalled the all-time medal tally on Saturday by winning bronze in the 10m air pistol - pulling level with Australian shooter Phillip Adams on 18 medals.

Bowing out: Mick Gault OBE has retired for a second time following his exit from the 50m pistol event

A weightlifter from Papua New Guinea has been charged with allegedly sexually assaulting another man in the toilets of a Tesco near the athletes’ village on Sunday.

Toua Udin, 22, spent the night in a cell following his arrest after finishing ninth in the 77kg category the same day. He has denied the charges.

PRODIGY REBEKAH FALLS JUST SHORT

English weightlifter Rebekah Tiler came agonisingly close to a bronze medal in the 69kg weight category, twice narrowly failing to lift 123kg in the clean and jerk. Schoolgirl Tiler, 15, managed a highly respectable fourth place, with a combined total of 209kg. The event was won by Cameroon’s Marie Fegue - eight years Tiler’s senior - with a total lift of 234kg.

Morgan Lake, 17, may not be appearing in Glasgow, but she won two golds at the World Junior Championships. After setting a new world youth record to win the heptathlon, she took gold in the high jump. It was clearly meant to be: there’s a lagoon in Oregon, where the event took place, called Morgan Lake.
