A footballer searching for his long-lost family found he had a sister playing for the same team.

Barrie Prowse, 27, was adopted as a baby and wanted to trace his biological parents, managing to track down his mother and discovering he had a sister - Gemma Sanders, 23.

But it turned out that they were players for the same football club. Father-of-two Barrie, 27, plays centre midfield for the men's team at Penzance AFC in Cornwall - while Miss Sanders plays for the women's XI.

They played at the same ground, trained on the same pitch and regularly enjoyed a post-game pint at the same clubhouse - while unaware they were brother and sister.

Mr Prowse, of Penzance, Cornwall, who is married, said he had often watched his sister, who is deaf, play matches for the South West Peninsula League Premier Division side.

He said: ‘I would sometimes take my two girls down to the pitches to watch the woman's matches that Gemma was playing in.

‘Funnily enough, a friend of mine had once told me to watch out for a deaf girl playing in the team because she was such a fantastic player. I hate to say it but Gemma is a better footballer than me.

‘I was gutted because I've always been the best sportsman in my family.’

Support worker Miss Sanders lives 15 miles away from Mr Prowse in Redruth, Cornwall, and also plays for the Great Britain deaf women's football team.

She said: ‘I got a Facebook message from Barrie saying he was my big brother and I was in shock, I just couldn't believe it.

‘I would play for the women's team on a Sunday and he would play for the men's team on a Saturday. After the game we would go to the bar at the ground and have a few drinks.

‘Obviously I didn't know about Barrie but now I know we would have been in the same bar and I always wonder if we have spoken before. We could have walked past each other.

‘I may have seen his two daughters and not known that I was their aunt. It is just such a weird story, we didn't even know each other but we might have said hello.

‘Thinking back, it is mad to think what could have happened, he could have held a door for me or anything. I am just really pleased that he found me.’

Mr Prowse used Facebook and the Genes Reunited website to track down mother Caroline Perry, 45, who had given him up aged 18.

Following the reunion Mr Prowse was told he had four brothers from her side, sister Miss Sanders and a brother through his father, Anton Whitehead, who died in 1995.

Mr Prowse said: ‘I kept typing Gemma's name into Google and it was coming up saying “Penzance football”. I couldn't figure out why it kept coming up. I was thinking: “Surely not, this can't be right”.

‘But then my wife Natalie sent me a link to Gemma's Facebook and we spoke on there and realised we were related - it was surreal.’

Mr Prowse, an IT recruiter, has now met with all his living biological relatives with the full blessing of adoptive parents, Keith Prowse, 66, and wife Elizabeth, 59.

He has also introduced them to his own family - dance teacher wife Natalie, 28, and their two girls, Taylor-Grace, four, and one-year-old Kenza-Rae.
