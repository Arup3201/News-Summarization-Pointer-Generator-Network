A Newport Beach lifeguard accidentally drowned during his attempt to save someone in the water in Southern California in July, it has been revealed. 

The Daily Pilot reported Friday that Ben Carlson's bruises and scrapes are pointed out in his autopsy report.

The 32-year-old lifeguard's heart was 'severely enlarged,' the newspaper said.

Injuries: Carlson had bruises and his heart was reportedly enlarged

His blood contained marijuana compound THC, the newspaper reported.

Newport Beach Fire Chief Scott Poster told The Daily Pilot that officials from the Orange County coroner's office said the compound did not contribute to his death.

'None of us believe he had any impairment,' Poster told the newspaper.

'He'll be remembered by his friends and co-workers as one of our best and most observant lifeguards,' Poster also said.

Carlson died July 6.

The 15-year department veteran had gone into the water to help when he and the swimmer were both hit by a large wave.

Carlson went under, though the swimmer was able to return to the beach. 

A website for Newport Beach says Carlson graduated from University of California-Irvine and was a member of the water polo team.

Carlson worked as a bartender in the area and enjoyed both surfing and golfing, according to the website.

After his death, The Los Angeles Times reported that over 2,000 people participated in a paddle-out to memorialize Carlson.

A statue of Carlson is expected to be built, The Daily Pilot reported last month.

The Ben Carlson Foundation has also been established.
