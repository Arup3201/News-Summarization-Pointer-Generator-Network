A Crossrail worker holds one of 20 new Roman skulls discovered beneath London's Liverpool Street Station

Construction workers in London have made an 'unexpected and fascinating discovery' during work on the city's billion pound Crossrail project.

Around 20 Roman skulls have been unearthed by tunnellers working beneath Liverpool Street Station, where the historic River Walbrook flows.

Working under the direction of Crossrail's archaeologists, the construction workers carefully removed the human skulls and Roman pottery.

They were found buried in clusters in the sediment of the historic tributary.

For safety reasons the archaeologists had to leave the work to the tunnellers as the skulls were buried as deep as six metres below ground.

The cross-London scheme has already led 
to a number of exciting discoveries, including around 4,000 skeletons 
found buried in the Eldon Street area.

These skeletons were found in August and will be carefully removed 
during major archaeological excavations next year.

The latest discovery of the skulls and pottery was made below the site of the historic Bedlam burial ground.

Bedlam hospital was a psychiatric asylum and patients who died while at the hospital were buried in a cemetery first established in the 16th century.

Historically, Roman skulls have been found along the Thames tributary Walbrook during various excavations in the region. 

This led to speculation the skulls found were heads decapitated by Queen Boudicca's army during the rebellion against Roman occupation in the 1st century AD.

The latest discovery of the skulls, pictured, and pottery was made below the site of the historic Bedlam burial ground. Bedlam hospital was a psychiatric asylum and patients who died while at the hospital were buried in a cemetery first established in the 16th century

Archaeologists believe the skulls, pictured, may have washed downstream along the River Walbrook. They were found six metres under the ground below what is thought to have been a 16th century burial ground for patients of the Bedlam hospital

The hospital was originally called Bethlem – or 
Bethlehem - Hospital  was founded in 1247 by Simon FitzMary,
 a wealthy former Sheriff of London.

Its graveyard was built on the hspital’s vegetable patch in the 1560s after churchyards around the 
city started to overflow.

Bethlem's name quickly became 
pronounced ‘Bedlam’ by Londoners.

By 1403, the majority of its patients were lunatics. Others suffered from epilepsy, learning disabilities and dementia.

Archaeology later suggested the River Walbrook may have eroded a Roman cemetery under Eldon Street, and the skulls and other bones had been washed downstream.

Because the latest skulls were located in clusters, the archaeologists believe this indicates they were caught in a bend in the river and were washed out of the burial ground during Roman times.

Lead archaeologist Jay Carver said: 'This is an unexpected and fascinating discovery that reveals another piece in the jigsaw of London's history.

'This isn't the first time skulls 
have been found in the bed of the River Walbrook and many early 
historians suggested these people were killed during the Boudicca 
rebellion against the Romans.'

He
 went on: 'The skulls are possibly from a known Roman burial ground 
about 50 metres up river from our Liverpool Street station work site.

'Their location in the Roman layer indicates they were possibly washed down river during the Roman period.'

The Museum of London Archaeology will analyse the finds and hope to find out more about the age, sex and diet of the people associated with the Roman skulls. However, it will be difficult to distinguish Bedlam patients from other dead because mental illness will not have left any physical scars on the skeletons

The tunnellers have also discovered wooden medieval structures believed to have been part of the walls of the Bedlam burial ground.

It is thought headstones from the Bedlam cemetery were used as foundations for modern-day buildings.

The hospital was originally called Bethlem – or 
Bethlehem – and was founded in 1247 by Simon FitzMary,
 a wealthy former Sheriff of London, as a priory dedicated to St Mary of
 Bethlem.

Its graveyard was built on the hospital's vegetable patch in the 1560s after churchyards around the 
city started to overflow.

As well as patients, it was used to bury London’s poor and religious 
non-conformists.

Bethlem's name quickly became 
pronounced ‘Bedlam’ by Londoners.

By 1403, the majority of its patients were lunatics. Others suffered from epilepsy, learning disabilities and dementia.

The Museum of London Archaeology will analyse the finds over the coming months and hope to find out more about the age, sex and diet of the people associated with the Roman skulls.

However, it will be difficult to distinguish Bedlam patients from other dead because mental 
illness will not have left any physical scars on the skeletons.

Investigation: 4,000 skeletons will be disinterred and studied before being reburied elsewhere

In most cases, identification will be impossible, because although some were buried in 
coffins, any name plates recovered have been too rusty to read.

The 
dig’s manager, Nick Elsden from the Museum of London Archaeology, is 
part of a team of more than 100 archaeologists who are examining each of
 the 40 sites being dug up for Crossrail.

The 73-mile rail line that 
will link the City, Canary Wharf, the West End and Heathrow to commuter 
areas east and west of London.

The River Walbrook formed from tributaries coming from Shoreditch, Barbican and merging in the Finsbury Circus area of Central London.

It flows through the middle of the City of London beneath the Bank of England and joins the Thames between Southwark and Cannon Street Bridges.

It is believed to be named after a brook that ran through the London Wall, built by the Romans around London to protect the city.

Romans built the Temple of Mithras, which worshipped the ancient religion of Mithraism, on the banks of the Walbrook in the 3rd century AD.This temple was found during construction work in the 1950's.

Following the invasion of the Anglo-Saxons in the 6th century, Britons were forced to live on the east bank of the Walbrook, while the Saxons lived on the west.

The Walbrook began being covered by buildings in 1440 and it now runs entirely underground, running parallel to a street called Walbrook.
