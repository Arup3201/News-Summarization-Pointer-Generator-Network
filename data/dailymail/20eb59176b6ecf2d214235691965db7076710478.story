James DeGale emerged from the shadow of his domestic rivals on Saturday night before taking a dig at both Carl Froch and George Groves.

DeGale arguably stole the show with his stunning third-round knockout of Marco Antonio Periban but the 2008 Olympic champion must now wait for Froch to decide if he will grant him a shot at his world title.

‘I like Carl but it feels like he doesn’t want to fight me. I respect him but I think he’s being a bit of a coward not fighting me. Fight me or vacate the title,’ DeGale said.

DeGale risked his position as mandatory challenger to Froch by taking on the experienced Periban but a left hook sent the Mexican sprawling and referee Howard Foster immediately waved the fight off.

‘I bet I still won’t get any credit. My last two performances have been against world-class opponents,’ said DeGale. ‘It doesn’t matter though, my next fight is for a world title.’

DeGale was followed into the ring by Groves who looked out of sorts before stopping Denis Douglin in the seventh. Groves was vulnerable in the early stages and doubts remain as to how well he has recovered from his brutal knockout defeat by Froch in May.

DeGale, who lost to Groves in 2011 and as an amateur, said: ‘I haven’t been impressed with him. I know he’s young but he looks a bit shot. His confidence isn’t there and he’s not fighting right.’

Anthony Joshua looks primed for his toughest test to date when he faces veteran American Kevin Johnson in London in January. Heavyweight Joshua recorded his 10th successive stoppage, pummelling Michael Sprott into submission after just 90 seconds.

Johnson, however, is made of sterner stuff, having never been stopped despite facing Vitali Klitschko and Tyson Fury. Joshua said: ‘Johnson is durable and he’s got a lot of experience and quite a lot of mouth, so it should be fun.’
