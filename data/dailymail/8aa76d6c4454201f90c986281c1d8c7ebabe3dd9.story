It is known as the world's toughest team sport, where the players seem to spend more time embroiled in mass brawls and punch-ups than they do scoring goals.

But as these adorable pictures show, even the brutal world of professional ice hockey can have its tender moments.

When children of the Stanley Cup-winning Chicago Blackhawks players ventured onto the ice to celebrate their team's win, a fan of the losing Boston Bruins put rivalry aside to take their picture.

The youngsters couldn't hide their delight after the Blackhawks snatched a dramatic 3-2 victory to seal their second Stanley Cup in just four seasons.

But in a heartwarming display of sportsmanship, the Bruins' fan joined in with their celebrations and even took several victory snaps. Let's hope he sends them a copy.

The children were later pictured parading around the ice waving Blackhawks flags.

The Blackhawks were just seventy-six seconds away from defeat and a trip home for a decisive seventh game, when Bryan Bickell tied it.

Then, while the Bruins were settling in for another overtime in a series that has already had its share, Dave Bolland scored to give Chicago victory.

The back-to-back scores in the time it takes for one good rush down the ice turned a near-certain defeat into a championship clincher, stunning the Boston players and their fans and starting the celebrations on the Blackhawks' bench with 59 seconds to play.

'We thought we were going home for Game 7. You still think you're going to overtime and you're going to try to win it there.

'Then Bolly scores a huge goal 17 seconds later,' said Chicago forward Patrick Kane, who won the Conn Smythe Trophy as the postseason's most valuable player.

'It feels like the last 58 seconds were an eternity.'

The sold-out TD Garden had begun chanting 'We want the cup!' after Milan Lucic's goal put the Bruins up 2-1 with eight minutes left, but it fell silent after its team coughed up the lead.

The team came out to salute its fans as they streamed out of the building for the last time, from the air conditioning into the summer air.

The arena was almost empty - except for a few hundred fans in red Blackhawks sweaters who filtered down to the front rows - when NHL commissioner Gary Bettman handed the 35-pound Cup to Toews, who left Game 5 with an undisclosed injury and wasn't confirmed for the lineup until the morning skate.

The Chicago captain skated the cup right over the crease in which the Blackhawks mounted the comeback and in front of the fans in Blackhawks sweaters who lined the front row behind the net. Toews banged on the glass while the remaining Bruins fans headed up the runways.

He then continued the tradition of 
handing it from player to player before the team settled to the side of 
the face-off circle for a picture with the trophy they will keep for 
the next 12 months.

Just like in 2010, they won it in a Game 6 on the road.

'In 2010, we didn't really know what we were doing. We just, we played great hockey and we were kind of oblivious to how good we were playing,' said Toews, who scored his third goal of the playoffs to tie it 1-1 in the second period, then fed Bickell for the score that tied it with 76 seconds to play.

'This time around, we know definitely how much work it takes and how much sacrifice it takes to get back here and this is an unbelievable group,' Toews said. 'We've been through a lot together this year and this is a sweet way to finish it off.'

The Blackhawks opened the season on a 21-0-3 streak and coasted to the Presidents' Trophy that goes to the team with the best regular-season record. But regular-season excellence has not translated into playoff success: Chicago is the first team with the best record to win the cup since the 2008 Detroit Red Wings.
