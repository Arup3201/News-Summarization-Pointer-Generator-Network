A whistleblower said Mr Clegg's officials reversed plans to axe a £2billion spending project in his constituency

Nick Clegg was last night accused of playing ‘pork barrel’ politics by funnelling taxpayer funds into the constituencies of key Lib Dems.

According to claims made by a Coalition whistleblower, Deputy Prime Minister Mr Clegg and his right-hand man, Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander, have used their influence over public spending decisions to covertly boost the re-election chances of Lib Dem MPs.

The source told The Mail on Sunday that:

The source also claimed that public subsidies to reduce water bills in the South West were agreed by Chancellor George Osborne after pressure from Mr Clegg’s officials. Lib Dem MPs are clustered in that part of the country.

Matthew Sinclair of the TaxPayers’ Alliance said: ‘This type of pork barrel politics is completely unacceptable and Ministers must give assurances they are spending taxpayers’ money in the public interest and not feathering their own political nests.’

Tory MP Mark Reckless said: ‘This seems scandalous and underlines why it was a mistake for us to enter into a coalition. It is unacceptable for senior Lib Dems to get special treatment for their pet projects.’

According to the source, the decisions started after Mr Osborne ordered Ministers to draw up plans for public spending cuts.

One of the projects to be axed was a £2 billion scheme to refurbish roads, pavements and bridges in Sheffield – until Mr Clegg, MP for Sheffield Hallam, insisted otherwise.

 The term ‘pork barrel’ – meaning public spending diverted for local citizens – originates from a pre-American Civil War practice in the Deep South of giving slaves a barrel of salt pork as a reward and requiring them to compete among themselves to get their share of the handout.

The Oxford English Dictionary dates its modern usage in a political context back to 1873.

‘Sure enough, it was agreed that a private finance partnership would be forged, which took it off the Government balance sheet,’ said the source.

Responsibility for ‘signing off’ on the cuts fell to Mr Alexander, who in 2011 was facing the threat of changes to his constituency boundaries that would have forced him to go head- to-head with former Lib Dem leader Charles Kennedy.

According to the source, Mr Alexander privately insisted that extra funding should go to high-profile projects in his Highlands constituency, which includes the Cairngorms.

‘He presented, as a fait accompli, a proposal for more money for mountain rescue teams, ski-lifts and railways,’ the source said. He received credit in the local newspaper for the ‘perks’.

Another Coalition plan, to cut the 
number of full-time coastguard stations in Scotland, was abandoned in 
2011 at the behest of Mr Carmichael.

Mr
Hammond was called to a meeting by the then Government Chief Whip, 
Patrick McLoughlin, and Mr Carmichael to be told to abandon the plans.

Danny Alexander has salvaged the state subsidy for the Cairngorm Mountain Railway - which benefits his constituents

The source said: ‘Hammond was told the manning of Shetland’s coastguards was a “Coalition matter” and he should scrap it. He was angry about that.’

The source said hidden in spending decisions were ‘bungs’ to the Lib Dems to ‘keep them quiet’.

‘The 2012 Budget ploughed money into subsidising water bills in the South West where there are loads of Lib Dem MPs.

Last night, a Lib Dem spokesman failed to address the ‘pork barrel’ allegations. He said: ‘The biggest financial decisions the Lib Dems have made in Government have been to raise the income tax threshold every year.’

Mr Hammond was unavailable.

Philip Hammond, when Transport Secretary, was ‘angry’ to be summoned to a meeting with the Lib Dem Chief Whip Alistair Carmichael and told to abandon plans to make cuts to the coastguard service. He was told that stopping the cuts, which would have affected Mr Carmichael’s  Orkney and Shetland constituency, had become a ‘Coalition matter’.
