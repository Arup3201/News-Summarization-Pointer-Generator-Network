Coalition relations hit an all-time low yesterday after Liberal Democrats refused to back Jeremy Hunt as he was  branded a ‘liar’ in Parliament.

Tory MPs called their partners ‘traitors’ and vowed revenge – promising to vote against Nick Clegg’s plans to reform the Lords and to withdraw support for Lib Dem ministers in difficulty.

But there was uproar as Speaker John Bercow allowed Labour to accuse the beleaguered Culture Secretary of lying to MPs over his handling of Rupert Murdoch’s take-over bid for BSkyB.

Commons Leader Sir George Young protested that such remarks – normally ruled out of order – did  nothing to enhance the reputation of Parliament.

The Culture Secretary, who is widely expected to be moved from his job in a forthcoming reshuffle, told MPs the accusation was ‘disgraceful’.

But he admitted he may have ‘inadvertently’ provided incorrect information when he claimed in the Commons to have released all his correspondence relating to the deal.

A Labour motion calling for Mr Hunt to be referred for investigation by Sir Alex Allan, the independent adviser on the Ministerial Code, was defeated by 290 to 252 votes.

This was despite Mr Clegg ordering his Lib Dem MPs to abstain, a move seen as an unprecedented slap in the face for David Cameron.

On his bike: Jeremy Hunt leaves his London home yesterday

One Tory MP, Justin Tomlinson, had to return from his honeymoon in Mauritius to take part in the vote, while another, Conor Burns, was forced to leave his hospital bed. Mr Cameron decided less than half an hour after Mr Hunt concluded his evidence to the Leveson Inquiry a fortnight ago that he would not order a further investigation into whether ministerial rules had been broken.

It emerged at the inquiry that hundreds of texts and phone calls were exchanged between Mr Hunt’s special adviser Adam Smith and News Corp.

Opposition MPs also allege Mr Hunt misled Parliament when he said he made no intervention in the bid while Business Secretary Vince Cable was handling it, since it has now emerged that he sent Mr Cameron a memo effusively backing the Murdochs.

The Culture Secretary suggested that he had not lied, but may have ‘inadvertently’ misled Parliament by failing to disclose the note, in which he said that failing to agree to the bid for the broadcaster would set Britain’s media sector back a decade.

Shadow minister Chris Bryant said Mr Hunt had told MPs that it would be too expensive to detail all of his exchanges on the subject.

‘How much would it have cost to reveal he sent a letter to the Prime Minister? He has lied to Parliament!’ Mr Bryant shouted, prompting angry protests from Tory MPs.

Mr Hunt said there was a ‘huge difference between misleading Parliament inadvertently and lying’. The Prime Minister told MPs that he ‘understood’ the motives of the Lib Dems in not backing Mr Hunt, saying it was ‘politics’.

Mr Clegg told his Lib Dem MPs to stay away from yesterday’s vote, but caused confusion when he then backed Mr Hunt’s handling of the bid during his own evidence to the Leveson Inquiry.

He said the Culture Secretary had given a ‘full, good and convincing account of himself’.

Lib Dem aides said Mr Clegg believed Sir Alex should investigate a potential breach of the Ministerial Code, nonetheless, given that ministers are meant to take responsibility for the actions of their special advisers.

Tory party bosses asked MPs not to attack Lib Dems publicly for their failure to back Mr Hunt. But several ignored the edict.

Conservative MP Nadine Dorries said: ‘Everyone is furious on our side. Jeremy is a good man and the questions about him have all been covered.

‘I think it will hit home to a lot of people that they are traitors, that they are not proper members of this Government.’

Louise Mensch, a Tory member of the culture select committee, said the Lib Dems were ‘being silly’. Another senior MP said privately: ‘On our side we’ve fought for Lib Dems who got into trouble, like David Laws.

‘This is a fundamental breach of faith and a turning point in the Coalition.

‘It has actually had the effect of rallying our benches behind Jeremy Hunt and ensuring that very many people will be less willing to go along with Liberal Democrat hobby horses like Lords reform.’

David Cameron was accused of a ‘smokescreen’ last night after insisting he had the support of the ministerial sleaze watchdog for his decision not to refer Jeremy Hunt for investigation over his handling of Rupert Murdoch’s takeover bid for BSkyB.

The Prime Minister yesterday brandished a letter in which Sir Alex Allan, suggested that because the Leveson Inquiry into media standards was ongoing and taking evidence under oath, it would not be appropriate for him to hold a further fact-finding probe.

‘I do not believe I could usefully add to the facts in this case, though I remain available should circumstances change or new evidence emerge,’ Sir Alex, the independent adviser on ministerial interests, wrote.

Debate: Mr Cameron said Mr Hunt, top left of the picture, had handled himself well and needn't be probed over the issue

Labour critics accused Downing Street of a ‘stunt’ designed to take the heat off Mr Hunt ahead of the Commons vote and Mr Cameron as he prepared for his own appearance before the Leveson Inquiry today.

They said that Sir Alex was not being asked to establish the facts, but whether the Culture Secretary broke the Ministerial Code in his handling of the £8billion takeover application.

The full exchanges, published by the Cabinet Office during Prime Minister’s Questions, made it clear that Sir Alex had not been asked to make any judgment on whether the code had been broken.

Given that both letters bore yesterday’s date, Downing Street also faced questions over the startling speed with which the watchdog replied, raising suspicions that the exchange had been pre-planned. Labour frontbencher Chris Bryant, a victim of phone hacking, said it was ‘suspicious’ that the Prime Minister and Sir Alex had exchanged letters yesterday morning, given that two weeks have passed since Mr Hunt gave evidence.
