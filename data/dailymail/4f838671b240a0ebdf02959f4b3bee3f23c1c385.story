Anti-domestic violence campaigner Denise Brown has been caught up in the tricky situation of her son being accused of beating up his girlfriend.

Ms Brown’s sister Nicole Brown Simpson was suspected of being killed by ex-husband O.J. Simpson in Los Angeles, California, in June 1994.

In the early hours of this morning Sean Brown, 25, and his girlfriend Amy Johnson, 22, were arrested at their home in Orange County, California.

They were arrested for injury charges and investigators told MailOnline visible marks were seen on them both. Mr Brown will be in court tomorrow.

Both were taken into custody after police responded to the scene of their home following a call at 2:30am on Tuesday morning, reported TMZ.

Ms Brown founded the Nicole Brown Foundation as a non-profit U.S.  organisation that stands against domestic violence.

Former NFL player O.J. Simpson is serving a nine-year sentence at a jail in Lovelock, Nevada, after his robbery and kidnap conviction in Las Vegas.

The conviction came in October 2008 after
a trial following his botched heist to retrieve sports memorabilia he 
said was stolen by dealers.

Sensational trial: Nicole Brown Simpson was suspected of being killed by ex-husband O.J. Simpson in Los Angeles, California, in June 1994

He was acquitted in October 1995 of the murders of Mrs Simpson and her friend Ronald Goldman despite huge amounts of evidence against him.

After the bodies were found in a pool of blood on her driveway, Simpson began a bizarre slow-speed car chase with police.

Almost 100million people are thought to have watched the events live on TV as the sports star held a gun to his head while being driven by a friend.

He was allegedly headed for the Mexican border with $5,000 dollars and his passport when he was tracked by authorities.

Eventually more than 25 police cars trailed him until he surrendered on his mansion's driveway an hour and a half later.

Evidence against him included bloodstains in his car, a glove holding DNA from the three and a sock with his victims' blood on his bedroom carpet.
