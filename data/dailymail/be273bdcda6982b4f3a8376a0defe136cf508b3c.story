Milton Keynes Dons' remarkable cup run is set to continue after they overcame fellow League One high-fliers Bradford City at Stadium mk.

Benik Afobe, who scored twice against Manchester United in the second round, bagged another brace as Karl Robinson's side reached the last 16 of the Capital One Cup for the first time in their history.

Afobe netted in the fifth minute to put the Dons ahead, and then sealed the victory five minutes from time to earn the Dons a place in round four.

The first goal in particular was spectacular, as the on-loan Arsenal striker spun away from his marker and fired into the bottom corner from 20 yards for his ninth goal of the season.

On the night his parent club went out of the competition at home to Southampton, it was the kind of inspiration they could have done with.

Bradford, who famously reached the final of this competition two years ago, had plenty of chances to get back into the game, Mason Bennet and Jason Kennedy spurning the best opportunities as the visitors shaded possession.

But the Bantams were unable to find an equaliser, and when Liverpool target Dele Alli slid the ball through for Afobe in the 86th minute the striker had the pace and composure to secure the win. 

MK Dons assistant manager Richie Barker was full of praise for the on-loan striker who has now bagged nine goals in this season's competition.

'Benik has scored a lot of one-on-ones because of his pace,' said Barker, 'but the way he took his first goal was excellent. I didn't realise how good it was until I watched it the second time around.

'He's got everything. And to be fair to him and Will Grigg - who have rotated - every time one of them starts they end up scoring and it gives us a headache in terms of team selection.'
