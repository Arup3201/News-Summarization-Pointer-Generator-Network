A photographer got a little too close to the action when he nearly got bitten by a caiman during a rescue mission.

The reptile had got stuck in a swimming pool at a lodge in Pantanal, Brazil, and staff attempted to save it by pulling it out of the water by the tail.

Wildlife guide and photographer Paul Goldstein rushed to assist, but escaped with barely an inch to spare when the animal launched itself teeth first towards his legs.

Too close for comfort: Paul Goldstein is nearly bitten by the caiman as it bares its teeth after being pulled out of the pool at Pousada Araras Lodge in Pantanal, Brazil

The 10ft reptile had gotten stuck in the pool at Pousada Araras Lodge in Pantanal, where Mr Goldstein, from Wimbledon, was staying with a group he was guiding.

Wimbledon-based Paul explains: ‘I was alerted by one of my tour clients after breakfast that an adult caiman was at the bottom of the pool.

’The creature had got himself stuck and local guide Juan and Ingrid Girahn from the lodge did their best to help free it from its chlorine-based incarceration.

’It proved very hard and also dangerous as a bite from this ten foot close relative of the crocodile would be more than a little graze.'

Helping hands: The caiman was discovered in the lodge's pool and staff and guests immediately came to its aid

See you later alligator: After trying several different methods, the staff concluded that they needed to pull the caiman out of the pool by hand - tail first

Tail end: The 10ft reptile struggled as its rescuers began to pull it by its tail

’This is a heavy animal so once I realised it was a struggle I got involved but it twisted out of our grasp.

’It was not until I saw the photos that I realised it was that close to biting me.

’Eventually
it was freed and skulked down to a nearby shrunken pool to go fishing, 
it seemed the caiman was unimpressed by the whole ordeal.’

Caimans hail from the alligator family and closely resembles its cousins in appearance.

The
caimans, native to Central and South America, are generally smaller 
than alligators, and normally grow to be between four and six feet.

Taking a risk: A helpful Mr Goldstein comes around to lend a hand to free the caiman, moving dangerously close to its front

Sharp edge: As he leans in, the caiman launches itself towards him with an open mouth, ready to take a chunk out of his leg
