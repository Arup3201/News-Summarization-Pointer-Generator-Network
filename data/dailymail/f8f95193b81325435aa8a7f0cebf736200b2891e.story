Chaz Bono arrived for his first rehearsal session in Los Angeles today after being unveiled as a new contestant on Dancing With The Stars.

He was dressed for comfort in a vest top - which revealed his tattooed arms - shorts and sneakers.

The 42-year-old, who last night attended a cast party at the Next Door Lounge in Los Angeles with his girlfriend Jenny Elia, was clearly prepared to work up a sweat with a white towel in tow.

Famous mother: Bono, who was called Chastity before undergoing a sex change, with Cher

Bono is the only child of singers 
Cher and Sonny Bono who recently underwent a female-to-male sex change 
which was chronicled in the TV documentary Finding Chaz.

He said he is excited to dance 'the way I always should have, which is as a male partnered with a woman.'

While the contestants' partners have 
not been revealed, professional dancer Lacey Schwimmer was also spotted 
at the studio, suggesting they may be paired up.

Bono's inclusion in the celebrity 
line-up was today praised by GLAAD (Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against 
Defamation), with a spokesperson saying ABC has 'created primetime 
firsts that reflect the growing acceptance of gay and transgender people
in America today.'

Hairspray star Ricki Lake, 42, and Wilson Phillips singer Chynna 
Phillips, 43.

Grace said today: 'I feel like 
Cinderella that got invited to the ball. I don't know how to dance.

'I 
don't know what I'm going to wear, but I know I have been invited.'

Cavallari is hoping the competition will help take her mind off her split from fiancé, quarterback Jay Cutler.

'It's good to stay busy,' says the

'I have no idea if I'll be good or 
not. I have a lot of anxiety about just getting in there and seeing how 
well I'll be able to pick up the dances.'

Rounding out the line-up for season 
13 are Los Angeles Lakers ace Ron Artest, 31, and Kim Kardashian's 
little brother, 24-year-old Rob Kardashian who arrived today looking perky in a bright orange T-shirt and blue shorts.

turned soap star J.R. Martinez, 28, also appears.

Arquette said he is looking forward to spending time with fellow contestant Bono. 

He said: 'I look forward to talking 
to him because my sister Alexis is transgender and I saw some of the 
struggles she had so I just feel like we could have a great connection 
on that.'

Arquette also said he had to get his seven-year-old daughter's permission before joining the dancing show.

He told a U.S. radio show: 'I talked about being on Dancing With The Stars over with my daughter Coco.

'She said "Initially my feeling is no but let me go to school and talk it over with my friend".'

Arquette, who has recently split from Friends star Courteney Cox, added: 'But she came round and now she's supportive.'

The new series of the ABC network programme begins on September 19.
