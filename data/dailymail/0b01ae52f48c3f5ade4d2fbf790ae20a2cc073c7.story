Warped thinking: Abu Rahin Aziz, pictured in Syria, has justified the brutality of ISIS by claiming the regime has weekly bin collections

A British fighter has justified the barbarism of the Islamic State including the burning alive of a Jordanian pilot by claiming the terror group has set up regular household bin collections for the Syrian people under its control.

Abu Rahin Aziz, 33, from Luton, said: 'Did you know? The #islamicstate is so barbaric & their streets filthy, they have regular cleaning services. Bin collection, street cleaning.'

Aziz, who made the sick claim on twitter, also promised that when Sharia law comes to the UK it would mean executions in Trafalgar Square and Buckingham Palace being turned into a grand mosque.

In a series of extreme tweets, he said the Jordanian pilot 'got what he deserved'.

In other vile Twitter boasts:

His Twitter account has since been suspended. 

The Islamic State plunged to new depths of depravity this week after releasing a video showing Jordanian pilot Moaz al-Kassasbeh being burned alive.

The sickening murder has triggered worldwide revulsion, including a promise by Jordan's king to wage a 'harsh' war against the militants.

Aziz, 33, who tweets under the name 'Abu Abdullah Britani', is an associate of hate cleric Anjem Choudary.

He was once a member of radical group 'Muslims Against Crusaders' who set fire to a large poppy on Armistice Day in 2010.

Last month, he fled to join ISIS in Syria while on bail for stabbing a football fan in the head with a pen.

Abu Rahin Aziz's vile boast comes as new figures laid bare the soaring cost of fly-tipping in Britain amid cuts to rubbish collections.

Councils dealt with 852,000 reports of waste being dumped by roads or byways last year – 140,000 up on 2013.

Household waste was behind two-thirds of the fly-tipping, according to the figures from rom the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs.

The cost of clearing up the mess was £45million, 25 per cent more than the year before.

Councils are imposing new restrictions on households, including the introduction of collections every third week in some areas.

Others have made recycling even more complicated, have rationed the amount of waste they will remove or brought in fees for one-off pick-ups. 

Town halls in Bury in the North West and Gwynedd in Wales have introduced three-weekly collections while Somerset has tested out the idea. 

In Aziz's hometown of Luton, household waste collections are weekly, but garden waste  has been suspended for the winter until March 2.

Luton Borough Council has not yet responded to a request for comment. 

He was later handed a 36-week jail sentence in his absence over the attack in London's West End. 

He recently told his followers on Twitter that he 'stabbed a kafir [non-believer] in the back of a head (sic) with a pen in London for insulting the prophet Mohammed.'

The former credit control operator has since posted a pictures of himself dressed in a military vest and posing with an AK-47 rifle.   

He has also contemplated on Twitter which method he would use to destroy his British passport, confirming his intention not to return to the UK.

He wrote: 'Still deciding to what to do with my British passport, could burn it, flush it down the toilet.'

It is understood Aziz fled via Amsterdam to Turkey and crossed over the Syrian-Turkish border. 

The whereabouts of his wife and two children are not known.

The jihadist also posted a photograph of himself and Dr Mirza Tariq Ali, 38, captioned: 'This is us breaking our bail conditions being together in UK.'

The photo shows the two bearded radicals, dressed in matching white thobes and pakol hats.

Dr Mirza Tariq Ali, a former NHS surgeon, fled the UK in 2013, after he was arrested for repeatedly assaulting a bystander at a rally. 

Last week, Aziz also threatened MPs and servicemen in a string of sinister tweets by inciting fellow extremists to carry out attacks on the West using guns, bombs or even by throwing stones.

'Muslims in the West given instructions to strike the enemies of Islam and Muslims within their own countries,' Aziz wrote. 'Wonder who will strike first?

'Could it be UK first to be attacked? They've attacked us with jets killing scores, plus they have many Muslims in prison as war on Islam.

'Maybe sit and wait outside TA offices? Maybe some other interests, maybe an MP. Hmm interesting. UK can blame foreign policy.'  

He also insulted the memory of Alan Henning, the British aid worker murdered by ISIS, saying that he would 'burn in hell' because he was not a Muslim.   

And last month, he also wrote an account of a bombing raid on a nearby building - claiming that he is protected from the U.S.-led bombardment because he is living in a building with no windows.
