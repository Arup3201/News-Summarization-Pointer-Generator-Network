'Bonkers': Robert Peston has dismissed accusations of homophobia after using the term 'Queer Street'

The BBC's Business Editor Robert Peston has dismissed homophobia claims against him as 'bonkers', after he used the term 'Queer Street'.

Mr Peston used the term on his blog to describe the European financial crisis. He also posted a link to the blog on his Twitter account, where he has 95,000 followers.  

In praising the UK's handling of the situation, he wrote: 'The Debt Management Office, has taken a reassuringly long-term approach to managing the UK government's debts - and without its prudence, we might all be in Queer Street or Skid Row by now.'

However, Mr Peston was criticised soon after as people accused him of homophobia over the use of the word 'queer', which has long been used as an insult against the gay community.

One tweet from follower Peter Scott, said: 'Tsk tsk Mr P, not quite homophobic but a bit homo-frowny'.

Two hours later Mr Peston was moved to comment on the row and dispatched another tweet.

It read: 'Some of you seem to think my use of the phrase "Queer Street" is in some way homophobic. Bonkers.'

The tweet included a link to the Wikipedia page detailing the origin of the term Queer Street.

While Peston was criticisied in some quarters, he has been robustly defended in others.

The offending phrase: The term 'Queer Street' was used in the final paragraph of his original blog post

Hitting back: Mr Peston's response to the accusations of homophobia

One of his followers, Joan Wilson, lamented the Twitter criticism: 'If there were more reflection and less reaction, this country wouldn't be in this state.'

But Mr Peston, who is married to novelist Sian Busby, was also defended by the gay rights campaigner Peter Tatchell.

He said the row was an over-reaction because the BBC reporter had not meant the word to be derogatory.

'People are being oversensitive, I appreciate their good intentions but he wasn’t using it in a gay put-down sense,' he told The Telegraph,

'The etymology of the word "queer" as Robert Peston used it has nothing to do with homosexuality.'

While the origins of the term are debated, 'Queer Street' is generally associated with a place of financial difficulty

One of the various explanations of its etymology is that it is a distortion of Carey Street in London, which was once associated with debtors' courts.
