The Defense Department says the three troops killed on Saturday in eastern Afghanistan by an Afghan wearing a security forces uniform are Americans.It appears to be the seventh such attack by a member of the Afghan forces against their international allies.A Defense Department official says no details will be released about the three American troops killed in the attack until after notification of relatives.

An Afghan Defense Ministry spokesman says the shooting took place on Saturday near the Pakistan border in the capital of eastern Paktia province, the city of Gardez. A security official there says the attack took place inside a base of the Afghan army in Gardez.So far this year, 11 foreign soldiers have been killed in such attacks, including the attack on Saturday.

The surge in insider attacks is a sign of how security has deteriorated as NATO prepares its military exit from Afghanistan by the end of 2014. The U.S. will remain with about 68,000 troops at the end of September.

NATO and U.S. forces are working with the Afghan government to tighten vetting procedures and increase security between the forces, but nothing has so far been able to stem the attacks on troops, which NATO frequently asserts are standing 'shoulder by shoulder.'In unusually blunt remarks to the Pentagon's own news service, the American Forces Press Service, Dempsey said the Afghan government needs to take the problem as seriously as do U.S. commanders and officials.
