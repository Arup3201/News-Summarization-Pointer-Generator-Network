Attack: Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg will insist fathers should no longer be made to see themselves as bread-winners

Nick Clegg will today launch an extraordinary attack on ‘old-fashioned’ bosses who ‘raise an eyebrow’ when men ask for time off work to look after their children.

The Deputy Prime Minister will insist fathers should no longer be made to see themselves as breadwinners rather than carers.

And he will claim more needs to be done to encourage men into caring professions such as childcare and nursing.

Mr Clegg will hail the Government’s changes to parental leave rules, which are being torn up next year to smash what he calls an ‘Edwardian’ attitude that women rather than men should stay at home to look young children.

It comes as a study found one in three fathers who work in the City of London took either no paternity leave or cut short their two-week entitlement.

The research, carried out by Cityfathers, a new support group for working fathers in the City, also found that one in five men feared it would be 'career death' to ask for time off to look after their children.

Speaking at the launch of the group today, Mr Clegg will say will say he has ‘fought to drag the clapped-out rules into the 21st century’.

He will highlight new childcare 
subsidies worth up to £2,000 year per child designed to encourage women 
to return to work, insisting Britain ‘could boost its GDP by up to 
£23billion if we use the skills of our female workforce more 
effectively’.

Mr Clegg will argue there is also a need
 for a culture change across British industry to tackle ‘clapped-out’ 
attitudes to flexible, family-friendly working practices.

He will say: ‘We need to challenge the ways in which many fathers are still pushed to see themselves as a breadwinner first and carer second – whether it’s by a manager’s raised eyebrow when you ask for some family time off, or your friends’ surprise when you say you’d like to be a stay-at-home parent if you could.’

Despite efforts to introduce flexible parental leave that can be shared between men and women and extend free childcare, there are still ‘hidden prejudices’ which limit women’s career ambitions and men’s ability to spend time with their families. The coalition’s reforms, he will say, are ‘only the start’.

Reforms to parental leave, which come into effect next year, have been the subject of a fierce coalition argument and have split the business community.

But the new study has raised fears that many fathers won't take advantage of the new rules, with one in three high-earners saying they won't be sharing their partner's maternity leave.

Cityfathers founder Louisa Symington-Mills said: 'Employers need to give greater support to their employees who are working hard, juggling office and home life, otherwise the prospects look dim both for morale in organisations and for the government's plans for more flexible working.'

The Institute of Directors has condemned the reforms as a ‘nightmare for small businesses’, but the Confederation of British Industry said it was pleased the Government had listened to concerns about how the system will operate.

The reforms mean that from April next year, parents will be able to share 52 weeks of parental leave.

New mothers will have to use the first two weeks, deemed important for recovery and bonding with a baby.

But then, they will be able to transfer the rest of their time off to their partner – meaning  a father can tell his employer he wants as much as 50 weeks off. Alternatively, parents could each take 25 weeks to run concurrently.

Nick Clegg’s salary is vastly outstripped by his wife.

Mr Clegg earns £134,565 a year as an MP and Deputy Prime Minister, while Miriam Clegg – a Spanish-born lawyer for international legal firm Dechert – earns £500,000.

Three sons: Mr Clegg and his wife Miriam, who brings in a £500,000 salary from her legal work

The Cleggs live in a £1.6million townhouse in Putney, South-West London. They married in 2000 and have three sons – Antonio, Alberto and Miguel.

Mrs Clegg has said previously that the pair split the childcare and her husband often tried to do the school run. She admitted they had a ‘fantastic nanny’ to help look after the children.
