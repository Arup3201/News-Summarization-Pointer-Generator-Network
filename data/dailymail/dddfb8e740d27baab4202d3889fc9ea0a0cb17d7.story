The Great Lakes - the world's largest group of freshwater lakes - were 78.9 per cent covered by ice on February 6, according to an analysis by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration

Not since early 1996 has ice been so widespread on the Great Lakes, with the frigid winter pushing Lake Superior toward a complete ice over.

Lake Superior had ice across an estimated 91 percent of its surface as of Thursday, according to the Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory.

The 40-year average annual Lake Superior ice coverage for February is just 30 percent.

George Leshkevich, who has been tracking Great Lakes ice for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory since 1973, said this winter has had among the most rapid ice buildups of his tenure.

Air temperatures show this is the coldest winter since 1979, according to Twin Cities.

According to an analysis by NOAA's Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory, ice covered 78.7 percent of the Great Lakes on February 6. Not since early 1996 has ice been so widespread on the Great Lakes. Seen here is Lake Superior at 4.22 pm local time on February 7, 2014

Ice cover on Lake Huron rocketed up an additional 14 percent this week, climbing to a total ice cover of 86 percent. If the ice continues to build at that rate in this next week, Lake Huron could be almost frozen over, or frozen over by the end of next week

Winter weather expert for The Weather Channel, Tom Niziol shows how the current Great Lakes ice cover was pacing close to that from early February 1977, another year in which the peak ice cover topped 90 percent

The widespread ice in January and early February this year 'wouldn't have been anomalous back in the '70s or with some of the winters in the mid-'90s'.

'But it certainly has been a while since we've seen this much ice this early,' Leshkevich said.

If this winter's cold trend continues, Leshkevich said the lake will freeze over, as it last did in 1996.

But he's not willing to go out on a limb and predict a total freeze-over.

'If it warms up later in February, or we get a lot of wind, then things can change pretty fast,' Leshkevich said.

'It's all dependent on the weather, and I don't predict that.'

While the percentage of the lake that's frozen continues to climb, satellite photos have revealed pockets of open water along the North Shore and the large, deep eastern basin of the lake.

'There's a lot of deep water that serves as a heat pump in those areas. They are usually the last to freeze,' Leshkevich noted.

Lake Ontario has been covered by about 25 per cent. Here it is seen at 3.38pm on February 6, 2014

Lake Ontario has been covered with as much as 79 percent ice, which occurred in the winter of 1994. Seen here about 7pm on February 6, 2014

Beyond that, there are some preliminary indications the cold may finally ease up by next weekend, but that outlook remains too uncertain at this time. Lake Ontario is seen here on February 6, 2014 at 6.59pm

The lake came close to freezing over in 2003 and 2009 but hasn't hit a high enough ice concentration to be considered officially frozen since 1996. According to the Great Lakes Aquarium, 1979 and 1962 saw nearly complete freeze-overs of Lake Superior, with the lake about 95 percent ice covered in 1972.

On average, about 40 percent of the Great Lakes surface area freezes each winter at its peak. Already this year that number has hit 70 percent and continues to climb. Michigan has hit about 55 percent ice cover; Huron 83 percent; Erie 93 percent and Ontario 27 percent this week.

On average, ice coverage peaks in early March and then rapidly diminishes.

This winter's vast ice on the Great Lakes is bucking a long-term trend of less and less ice as winters have, on average, become warmer.

The average amount of ice covering the Great Lakes declined by 71 percent between 1973 and 2011, with Lake Superior ice coverage down 79 percent, according to a report published in 2012 by the American Meteorological Society.

Researchers used Coast Guard reports and satellite photographs taken from 1973 to 2010 to determine the ice coverage of all the lakes, with Lake Ontario ice dropping 88 percent while ice in Lake St. Clair (between Lake Huron and Lake Erie) diminished by 37 percent.

Just under 88 percent of Lake Huron, almost 95 percent of Lake Erie, and 
around 53 percent of Lake Michigan are now ice covered.

Lake 
Ontario, which is much deeper than the others, is only about 29 percent ice covered.

Ice covers the landscape in the aftermath of a 
winter storm on Friday February 7, 2014, in Downingtown, Pa. Utility crews in
 Pennsylvania are still trying to restore power to more than 320,000 
customers

Meanwhile, in Pennsylvania and Maryland on Friday, small army of electricity 
restoration crews labored to reconnect more than 250,000 
customers in the area who lost power in an ice storm, 
and utility companies warned some will have to wait several more days.

The
 lion's share of the outages remained in the Philadelphia suburbs, where
 many schools were closed for a third day, and a PECO spokesman said 
work was continuing around the clock. PECO accounted for about 220,000 
outages Friday night.

'That 
number is coming down throughout the course of the day,' said PECO 
spokesman Fred Maher.

'We are preparing people for the fact that some 
folks will be without power over the weekend.'

The severe cold weather that gripped
 the mid-Atlantic on Friday was expected to remain in place for days, 
and forecasters said light snow was possible over the weekend.

Utility
 companies reported about 240,000 customers without power in 
Pennsylvania, most of them in the five-county Philadelphia area. In 
Maryland, service had been restored to all but about 16,000 homes and 
businesses.

The situation was not any better in the Pacific Northwest, where a rare and powerful snowstorm hammered more than a foot of snow in parts of western Oregon and southwest Washington.

Part two of the storm was expected to hit Oregon on Friday afternoon, bringing another 6 to 12 inches of snow.

A storm on Thursday storm left one person dead in a massive Interstate 5 pileup in 
southwest Washington, caused multiple other wrecks and closed schools 
and offices.

Many school districts in the region canceled Friday's classes as well.

The
 snowstorm also caused a string of multiple car crashes on I-5 near 
Albany, Ore., essentially closing the highway there for five hours, the 
Oregon Transportation Department said.

Highway crews in Oregon's Willamette Valley geared up for a night of snowplowing and sanding, focusing on highways that are most critical for commuters and businesses, Transportation Department spokesman Rick Little said.

'The public should understand there are simply not enough plows, sanders and staff to bring all highways in the region to bare pavement tonight,' Little said.

The last back-to-back snow event like this in the region hit in December 2008, said meteorologist Colby Neuman in the National Weather Service's Portland office.

The big I-5 pileup that killed one person and injured others occurred across the Columbia River in Washington state's Clark County.

At least half a dozen tractor-trailers were involved in the collision on the snow-covered freeway, The Columbian reported.

Washington State Patrol Trooper Steve Schatzel said several people were trapped in the wreckage. One suffered injuries described as critical and two others suffered serious injuries.

Oregon State Police Lt. Steve Mitchell described a 25-vehicle pileup on I-5 near Albany as 'pure chaos.'

Traffic backed up for miles. Only minor injuries were reported.

Oregon's largest city, Portland, recorded 3 ½ inches of snow by Thursday evening. Cars slipped and slid as commuters left work early. Some good-hearted residents helped push vehicles that got stuck.

A school bus slid on ice and collided with a car Thursday afternoon in Aloha, west of Portland, but firefighters said one of the children on the bus was taken to a hospital.

Snowfall totals as of Thursday night included 13 inches in the small town of Vernonia, Ore., northwest of Portland, and 10 inches in St. Helens, north of Portland along the Columbia River. Snow also fell along the Oregon coast; the community of Wheeler got 9 inches.

In the Willamette Valley south of Portland, Corvallis got 9.3 inches and Albany reported 7 ½ inches.

In the Columbia River Gorge that divides Oregon from Washington, snow was accented by 30-40 mph winds that gusted to 60 mph, Neuman said.

In southwest Washington, Ridgefield got 9 inches of snow, Woodland got 7 and Longview got 5.

The storm struck quickly Thursday morning, dumping snow on the Albany region and then spreading north.
