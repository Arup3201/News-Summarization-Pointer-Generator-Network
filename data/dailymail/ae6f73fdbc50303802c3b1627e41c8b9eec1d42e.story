A former security guard who posed as a wealthy investor to con £625,000 from a high-flying German businesswoman has been found guilty of fraud.

Rizwan Butt, 45, tricked company chief executive Talke Stauss by pretending to be a go-between for a potential $1.5 billion dollar investment into her hedge fund.

Mrs Stauss, 46, held a series of business meetings with Butt at top London hotels The Dorchester and The Ritz - not realising the bachelor had been living with his mother in a £56,000 inner city terraced house in Longsight, Manchester.

She claimed that she was so in love with Butt that she believed his story.

During the two month scam Butt went on 'a charm offensive' with his knowledge of finance, talk of introducing investors from the Middle East and of having a Swiss bank account.

After one meeting he drove former semi professional tennis player Mrs Stauss back to her apartment in a Bentley and later professed his love for her.

When he asked for a million dollars as a returnable 'security deposit' to clinch the deal, Mrs Stauss and her husband Roman, 44, agreed to transfer the money to Butt’s bank account without carrying out any checks on his background.

Trial: Mr and Mrs Stauss, who were conned out of £625,000, hid their faces as they left court

Roman Stauss, 44, said he knew paying a cash deposit was unusual but he agreed because Butt was from the Middle East

But the alarm was raised after Eddie George a fellow director at ATG Investment Managers Ltd found out about the deposit and was so worried, he himself researched Butt to discover he in fact ran a cleaning company with net assets of just £657.

Mrs Stauss realised she had been duped when she returned from a business trip she had enjoyed with Butt in Shanghai with a plan to leave her husband - only to be faced by Mr George insisting her lover was a fraud.

When Mrs Stauss asked for the money back, Butt - who had flown home early - sent a text message saying: 'Talke my dear. No problem my love. They should have it by five this evening. Take care love. Kisses.'

Four weeks later when police caught up with Butt he was at the wheel of a black Audi Q7 carrying £1,000 in cash.

He had recently bought a house for £175,000 and had a black Mercedes parked in the driveway.

The Bentley turned out to be rented and before the scam he drove a 2003 Honda Accord.

Before the scam, Butt worked as a security guard, lived with his mother and had bought his new house with a £30,000 deposit he borrowed from two friends.

Fraud: The black Mercedes in which Rizwan Butt, 45, arrived at Manchester Crown Court

At Manchester Crown Court Butt, who is the sole carer to his mother who is 72 years old and undergoing cancer treatment, showed no emotion as he was convicted of fraud by false representation after jurors took an hour and 50 minutes to reach their verdict.

He claimed the $1.5b deal would have gone through but it failed as ATG did not have a relevant trading licence.

He will be sentenced on December 20 and faces a Proceeds of Crime hearing.

Butt was granted bail on condition he surrenders his passport and does not contact Mr and Mrs Stauss.

But the judge Mr Justice Peter Openshaw said: 'The fact I have granted him bail is not in any way to be taken as any indication of sentence.'
