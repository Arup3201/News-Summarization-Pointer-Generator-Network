In my career, I never spat at anybody. It’s such a disgusting act and is one of the most disrespectful things you can do to another human being.

In some cultures, people do spit on the floor when they’re angry, but I can’t understand why people would spit at all. Jonny Evans certainly isn’t part of one of those cultures.

I don’t understand why people do it, but I did think there was some provocation on Wednesday night.

Evans and Cisse were both caught on camera appearing to spit at each other on Wednesday night 

Cisse has accepted a possible seven-game ban while Evans has until 6pm  on Friday, February 6 to respond 

It looked like Cisse ran his studs down Evans’s achilles and also made a straight-legged challenge on him.

That’s why we saw a transformation in the seemingly mild-mannered Evans. He says he was unaware of any spitting incident, but I find that hard to believe.

I was once spat at during a game in Turkey while I was playing for Everton. It was supposed to be a pre-season friendly but it was anything but. Our bus was even stoned by local fans.

When I was spat at, it was right into my face. But it wasn’t a case of being so angry I wanted to hit him, I was mostly just shocked. It was an abusive act and it is unacceptable.

As for punishment, you could argue it is as bad as, if not worse, than biting — and Luis Suarez, then of Liverpool, received an eight-match ban for biting Branislav Ivanovic.

Biting causes physical pain, but that is almost a childish, instinctive reaction. To spit in someone’s face is more deliberate and insulting. For me, spitting is worse.

But I don’t think spitting merits more than a three-match ban. Yes, there has to be a suspension, but it’s more important to educate players as to how badly incidents such as these come across to those watching the game, particularly youngsters.

‘Having woken up this morning I am shocked to have seen the media coverage from last night’s match. I would like to make it clear that I did not spit at Papiss Cisse.

‘I was totally unaware of any spitting incident and had assumed that the issue at the time was with the challenge and his attempted retaliation to the tackle from the floor. 

'During the game Papiss Cisse and I spoke about the incident and it is clear by my reaction in the television footage that I was totally surprised by any suggestion of spitting.

‘It is not in my character or in my nature to spit at anybody nor is it something I have ever done or would ever do. It is certainly not something that I did last night.’

THE GAMES HE COULD MISS FOR UNITED: Arsenal (h), Monday; Tottenham (h), March 15; Liverpool (a), March 22; Aston Villa (h), April 4; Man City (h) April 12; Chelsea (a) April 18. 

‘I have apologies to make to a lot of people today. Firstly to my team-mates and to our supporters, secondly to Jonny Evans, and thirdly to every football fan who saw the incident between myself and Jonny.

‘I reacted to something I found very unpleasant. Sometimes it is hard not to react, particularly in the heat of the moment. I have always tried hard to be a positive role model, especially for our young fans, and yesterday I let you down.

‘I hope children out there playing football for their clubs and schools this weekend will know better than to retaliate when they are angry. Perhaps when they see the problem it now causes me and my team they will be able to learn from my mistake, not copy it.’

THE GAMES HE’LL MISS FOR NEWCASTLE: Everton (a), March 15; Arsenal (h), March 21; Sunderland (a), April 5; Liverpool (a), April 13; Tottenham (h), April 19; Swansea (h), April 25; Leicester (a), May 2.
