After 132 years of only baby boys in the Waring family, no one thought the next arrival would be a girl. But then Annabelle Rose was born, to the delight of parents Deborah and Lee.

She is the first girl in five generations of Warings, who haven’t welcomed a member of the fairer sex to the family since the birth of Annabelle’s great-great grandmother Margaret in 1882.

Mrs Waring, 33, a senior project engineer, said: ‘I didn’t find out what we were having at the scan because I wanted it to be a surprise. There’s a lot of girls on my side of the family but none on Lee’s side.

‘I’d read that the sex of the baby comes more from the male side so we didn’t expect it. My husband is one of three boys, his middle brother has got three boys, so there is not a girl in sight.’

Deborah and Lee, 33, a senior web designer, from Leyland, Lancashire, who also have a three-year-old son, Lewis, said Annabelle has been ‘spoilt rotten’ by relatives since her birth last month. Mrs Waring said: ‘Everyone expected it to be another boy. We are all really happy and everybody is buying pink things.

‘I think all our family are enjoying being able to shop in the pink department for a change. Lewis loves her too and really looks after her.’ 

Since the birth of Mr Waring's great-great grandmother, the subsequent generations in the Waring family have included: John (1870-1957), Harry (1893-1980), Frank (1921-2002), Neil (1950 -present),

Mr Waring was born in 1981 and the Waring's eldest child Lewis was born in 2011.

Mrs Waring said: 'We are all really happy and everybody is buying pink things. She's totally

spoilt.

'Her entire wardrobe is made up of little pink cardigans and dresses. She has pink bunting in her room and lots of pink teddy bears.

'I think all our family are really enjoying being able to shop in the pink department for a change.

'Lee is delighted and he calls her his "little sweetheart". Lewis loves her too and he really looks after her."

Annabelle was born on November 15 at Chorley Birth Centre, in Lancashire,

weighing 6lb 12oz.

Mrs Waring added: 'She came really quickly. I was walking around the park on the Saturday morning, then came home and realised I was in labour and it was progressing quite quickly.

'She was born via water birth and she was born in her water sac into the birthing pool, which was really special for my husband to see - it's meant to be lucky.

'I think the birth centre heard more about her being a girl than actually delivering her!

'I think if we had been any later she wouldn't have been born in the birthing pool.

'She's settled in at home really well and she already weighs 8lb 10oz.

'We're just so happy to have a lovely little family and we feel incredibly lucky.'
