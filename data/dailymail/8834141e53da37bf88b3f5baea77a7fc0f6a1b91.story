A man who killed a cop nearly two decades ago was executed Tuesday night, in a highly controversial death penalty case. 

Robert Wayne Holsey was sentenced to death for shooting dead a sheriff's deputy, Will Robinson, in 1995 while he robbed a store in Milledgeville, Georgia.

He died just after 10:51pm local time, after having a last meal of eight pieces of fried chicken.

When a corrections official offered him sedatives to help him 'relax', Holsey declined, according to the Los Angeles Times. 

Just before his death, Holsey said a prayer and made a final statement, apologizing for killing Robinson and taking full responsibility for the crime.

Holsey's death was controversial since it later emerged that his original defense attorney had been drinking a quart of vodka a day during the trial and afterwards admitted that he was in no  state to represent anyone at the time.  

Holsey's new legal team has argued that because his lawyer was an alcoholic, he never received adequate representation at trial.

The jury did not hear about Holsey's intellectual disability or his horrific childhood during his 1997 trail, according to NBC.

The killer's trial attorney was disbarred in 2006 because of his drinking problem and also for stealing from a client. 

Holsey's latest defense team made every effort to stop his execution, requesting to stays from the Supreme Court on Tuesday. Both were declined, but it was noted that Justices Stephen G Breyer and Sonia Sotomayor would have voted in favor of staying the execution. 

The killer shot 26-year-old Deputy Robinson once in the right arm and once behind his right ear during a traffic stop following the robbery. 

He was arrested three hours later. The suspect was found guilty of all charges in February 1997 and sentenced to death.

Deputy Robinson is survived by his parents and two brothers. 

The family issued a statement Tuesday saying they were glad to see justice being served.

'William was a leader and true hero, evidenced by the years of outpouring of support to our family by all who loved and respected him,' the Robinson family said.
