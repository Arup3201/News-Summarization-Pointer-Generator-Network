Think of origami and you may imagine delicate paper cranes or fortune tellers.

But the art of folding paper to create 3D shapes has been used to make a flexible robot.

Roboticists have shown off two designs of origami-inspired wheel systems that allow a robot to shape-shift and climb a flight of steps using their intricate but strong wheels.

Best of both worlds: Roboticists have shown off designs of origami-inspired wheel systems (pictured) that allow robots to shape-shift and switch from either being fast or strong

The robotic wheel design is based on the ‘magic ball pattern' - a traditional technique used to create folded paper spheres.

The
 wheel can change its radius to create larger wheels to climb over 
things, and shrink back to a smaller size to squeeze under obstacles.

Each wheel features a single actuator, and sensors that detect changes in terrain.

The transmission is continuously 
variable and automatic, which means the wheels can respond to loads on the robot by 
decreasing in diameter until they reach the maximum size at which they 
can rotate smoothly.

Researchers from Seoul National University, South Korea, have designed a robotic wheel based on the ‘magic ball pattern,’ which is a traditional technique used to create folded paper spheres.

The wheel can change its radius to create larger wheels to climb over things, and shrink back to a smaller size to squeeze under obstacles, IEEE Spectrum reported from its International Conference on Robotics and Automation.

The wheel's lead creator, Professor Kyu-Jin Cho explained that his design can shrink to have a radius of two inches (5.5cm), and expand to have a bigger footprint of four inches (12cm), using just one actuator per wheel.

There are also sensors placed on the outside of each wheel to detect changes in terrain.

Scientists at Harvard Microrobotics Lab teamed up with the group in Seoul to enable the origami wheels to expand and shrink automatically.

They wanted to use the design to act as an automatic variable transition - a gearbox that changes seamlessly through an infinite number of effective gear ratios to alter a machine's speed and torque, or force.

The point of this was to design a robot that can be speedy as well as strong, in comparison to most robots with fixed-size wheels and gears that can either be fast, or powerful, but not both.

The origami wheel can do both because it expands and shrinks in size. It 'decides' how large it should be for the task automatically.

This system allows the small robot to zip along swiftly or to clamber over obstacles or to haul objects along.

The researchers said: ‘No adjustment is necessary. If the origami wheels have too much load on them to rotate, they stall, and as the wheel hubs continue to turn, the wheels collapse, which increases their torque until they can move.’

Because the transmission is continuously variable and automatic, the wheels can respond to loads on the robot by decreasing in diameter until they reach the maximum size at which they can rotate smoothly.

The scientists think their innovation could one day be used for interplanetary rovers as the wheel can be folded up and ‘inflate’ itself.
