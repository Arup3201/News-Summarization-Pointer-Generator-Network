An American biologist has spoken of his horror of finding a parasitic worm living in his mouth.

Dr Jonathan Allen, 36, played host to a Gongylonema pulchruma parasite which spent three months moving around the fleshy part of his cheeks and lips.

The parasite is usually only found in livestock and Dr Allen’s was just the 13th reported case in the U.S., and the 60th worldwide.

Dr Jonathan Allen Allen saw a surgeon about the lump in his bottom lip (left) but was told it was 'normal' so he decided to take matters into his own hands and removed the parasite (right) himself using forceps

Dr Allen, an invertebrate specialist at the College of William and Mary, in Virginia, was teaching a class when he first noticed a raised lump in his mouth, HuffPost Live reported.

‘It was in the mucosa [the fleshy part of the cheek]. The first three months, it was in the back of the throat in places I could touch with my tongue,’ he told the website.

‘I could feel it with my tongue but not my finger. It wasn't until it moved to my lip that I could see it and was willing to talk to someone other than my wife and confess this was in my body.’

When Dr Allen noticed the parasite in his mouth he visited his dentist who referred him to a surgeon.

However, when he saw the oral surgeon and explained that he had investigated his condition and believed himself to be the host of a parasite, the medic failed to believe him.

Dr Allen said: ‘He said it was a normal discolouration in my mouth and he sees it all the time.’

After the encounter, Dr Allen decided to deal with the problem himself.

Dr Allen, 36, played host to a Gongylonema pulchruma parasite which spent three months moving around the fleshy part of his cheeks and lips. He now keeps it in a jar

He used forceps to remove the parasite from his cheek with the help of his wife.

He then discovered that his neighbour is an expert on the Gongylonema pulchruma so the pair set about studying it.

Dr Allen now keeps the worm in a jar.

He has written a paper in the Journal of Tropical Medicine about his experience as a host for the parasite.

It is a worm that has no circulatory or respiratory system.

It is usually found in animals - especially cattle, dogs, cats and rabbits - but can be transmitted to humans through unsanitary conditions and the ingestion of infected insects.

It can also be picked up from foods that are contaminated during preparation in unsanitary conditions, or from contaminated water.

The average length of a male worm is 29mm and the average length of a female is 59mm.

The most common symptom in an infected human is the sensation of the worm moving around the mouth.

Symptoms do not tend to develop until about six weeks after infection.

The worm usually starts off in the oesophagus and then burrows its way into the mouth where it remains until it is removed.

In most cases the parasite is removed, either by surgeons, or by the patient.

If the worm is not extracted, symptoms can continue for up to a year.
