It remains one of the great mysteries of the art world - what is the secret behind the mysterious smile boasted by the woman in the Mona Lisa, the world's most famous painting?

Now a group of Italian art historians and archaeologists believe they are about to unravel the enigma after discovering what may be the skeleton of the woman who posed for artist Leonardo da Vinci.

Lisa Gherardini, the second wife of wealthy Florentine silk merchant Francesco del Giocondo, is recorded as buried in Saint Ursula convent and, after several false alarms, the team believe they have her remains.

Ancient find: Archeologists have found a skeleton they believe belonged to the model who inspired Da Vinci's Mona Lisa

Silvano Vinceti, a former TV producer, is leading the team attempting to exhume and identify Gherardini's remains by sending the bones to universities in Italy and abroad, where they will be checked against the DNA of two confirmed relatives of Gherardini.

If it is confirmed the researchers will be able to reconstruct her face.

Speaking to CNN, he said: 'Once we identify the remains we can reconstruct the face, with a margin of error of two to eight per cent. By doing this, we will finally be able to answer the question the art historians can't: Who was the model for Leonardo?'

There has been centuries of debate over the 77 by 52cm (30 by 31 inches) picture, also know as 'La Gioconda'.

Most
 modern historians agree that the lady depicted in the Mona Lisa was 
Lisa del Giocondo, who became a nun after her husband's death. She died 
in the convent on July 15, 1542, aged 63.

However, Vinceti is not certain whether the painting that now hangs in the Louvre in Paris is of her.

He added: 'When Leonardo began painting the model in front of him, he did not draw that metaphysical, ironic, poignant, elusive smile, but rather he painted a person who was dark and depressed.'

He believes the famous smile was added later and may belong to da Vinci's longtime assistant Gian Giacomo Caprotti, also rumoured to have been his lover.

The team unearthed a skull and other bones last year that they believe belonged to Lisa Gherardini

Other art historians say the 'Mona Lisa' is actually a sneaky self-portrait. An archeological team began digging at the abandoned Convent of Saint Ursula last year.

They first had to dig through thick concrete, laid down ahead of plans to turn the convent into an army barracks.

But they quickly struck gold, finding
 a crypt they believe to have been Lisa's final resting place and soon 
after they unearthed a female-sized human skull.

The skull was found five feet under the convent's original floor along with other fragments of human ribs and vertebrae.

Plans
 to continue the dig were suspended when the team ran out of funds, but 
they were able to resume earlier this year and found the skeleton.

Archeologist Silvano Vinceti, who is in charge of the dig, explained: 'We don't know yet if the bones belong to one single skeleton or more than one.

'But this confirms our hypothesis that in St.Ursula convent there are still human bones and we cannot exclude that among them there are bones belonging to Lisa Gherardini.'

Several skeletons have been discovered but the group believe the latest find is the one they have been looking for.

The initial discovery - made using 
ground penetrating radar and ancient maps and documents - came after a 
foot of modern concrete was removed and unearthed a layer of ancient, 
90-centimetre wide bricks.

Professor
 Vinceti said of the first discovery: 'This is a very exciting 
development and the find is consistent with our records and our 
preliminary research.

'The 
crypt we have found is the one that was mentioned in church records from
 1495 and was reached via a grate and then a staircase.

'We also know from those records that in 1625 there was a second crypt and these are the ones we have found.'

Resting place: The courtyard of the Saint Ursula convent in Florence, where archaeologists have been digging

Present on the dig is Natalia Gucciardini Strozzi, who is related to Lisa Gherardini and who is also a close friend of Prince Charles and former Prime Minister Tony Blair.

Speaking after the skull was discovered, she said: 'It was so emotional being here - I didn't think I would get so emotional. I am certain that this is the final resting place of Lisa Gherardini.'

It is not the first time that Professor Vinceti has used such techniques in his work. Last year similar methods were used to locate and identify the remains of Caravaggio, another Renaissance master.

In a Dan Brown-style mystery, Professor Vincenti also claimed that a hidden message could be seen in the eyes of the Mona Lisa after examining them with a high powered magnifying glass.

The Mona Lisa is an oil on panel painting owned by the French government and the image is so widely recognised and caricatured that it is considered the most famous painting in the world.

Da Vinci started to paint it in 1503 or 1504 and finished it in 1519, shortly before his death, and after he had moved to France.
