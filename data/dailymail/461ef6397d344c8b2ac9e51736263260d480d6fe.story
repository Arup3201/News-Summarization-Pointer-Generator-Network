A Pakistani sailor, serving on a navy vessel, has appeared to jump ship into crocodile infested waters, while participating in war games off the Northern Territory coast.

It's believed the man was last seen hiding in the bushes on the mainland, spotted by a local YMCA worker, after he was reported overboard in Darwin Harbour early Sunday.

Superintendent Rob Burgoyne told the NT News the 23 year old, who was taking part in the Australian Navy’s Exercise Kakadu on Pakistani warship PNS Nasr, disappeared into scrub and 'didn’t want to be found'.

A Pakistani sailor serving on the vessel jumped ship on Saturday into crocodile infested waters. A local YMCA worker is said to have spotted him hiding in the bushes on the mainland near Talc Head

'We don’t know what he’s wearing but he’s not in navy uniform and is small in stature,' he said.

A sea search following his disappearance, uncovered the sailor's backpack wrapped in plastic, floating in the water near Talc Head, on the Cox Peninsula, more than 100 kilometres from Darwin.

Thongs or sandals were also found by police. 

A number of search teams, including two choppers in the air, and boats scoured the area.

Superintendent Burgoyne told the NT News a dog searching for the man followed small foot prints about six kilometres south of Talc Head but they had no luck and the track went cold.  

Investigations continue following the man's disappearance and police are looking to Belyuen residents to see if they noticed anything suspicious. 

Defence adviser to the Pakistan High Commission in Canberra, Brigadier Muhammad Asghar also told ABC News, it was too early to say whether the sailor had slipped into the water or jumped.

Search teams have uncovered the backpack and sandals of the missing Pakistani salior, who its believed jumped ship during war games off the Northern Territory coast. The Pakistani government want the man to return as soon as possible, he could face criminal charges if found guilty

'Either way the Pakistani government wanted the man returned to them as soon as possible,' he said.

The man is likely to face disciplinary action and possible criminal charges if found guilty. 

A spokesperson from the Department of Defence said The Australian Defence Force is assisting with the search and rescue efforts.

'The sailor’s personal details will not be released at this time,' they said.

Kakadu is the Royal Australian Navy's largest Maritime warfare exercise for the year and includes over 1,200 people, eight warships and 26 aircraft.

15 coalition forces, from the Asia Pacific and Indian Ocean regions are in Australia until September 12 to conduct tactical warfare planning and cultural exchanges in Darwin.

They also head to sea for high end warfare serials including naval gunfire, communications, boardings and air defence.
