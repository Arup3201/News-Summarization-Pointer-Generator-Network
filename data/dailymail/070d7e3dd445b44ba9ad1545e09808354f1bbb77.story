Bradley Arthur, 24, was last seen at a house party in Grays, Essex, at around 4am and has not answered his mobile phone since

A major police hunt has been launched to find a missing father who disappeared in the early hours of New Year's Day after a party.

Bradley Arthur, 24, was last seen at a house party in Grays, Essex, at around 4am and has not answered his mobile phone since.

His frantic family and friends have launched a campaign appealing for the maintenance engineer to come home to his one-year-old son Archie.

Police are growing increasingly concerned for the young father as he was only wearing a blazer and jeans when he was last seen - and since then night-time temperatures have dropped below zero.

The search has widened to water-filled quarries, nature reserves and beaches and police have called in a helicopter to help.

People have been urged to check their gardens and sheds in case he is lying somewhere injured.

Mitchell Arthur tweeted a picture of Bradley's son Archie with the message: 'If anyone knows anything at all about Brads whereabout please let someone know, for this little boys sake.'

Ryan Corrigan tweeted: 'If one good thing is to happen to me this year, please get brad home safe back to my best mate, his brother.'

According to his Twitter profile, Bradley's son Archie was born on 19th October last year.

On Christmas Day, he tweeted: 'Happy Xmas Archie, love you.'

He later added: 'I can't wait till my little boy is old enough to have a toy garage. His (sic) not gonna get a look in on it.'

Mr Arthur is described as white, around 6ft tall and very thin with mousey brown hair and stubble.

When he was last seen he was wearing dark blue jeans, a white shirt and a grey blazer.

Inspector Alan Blakesley said: 'It is now more than 48 hours since anyone has heard from Bradley and the longer time passes without any contact the more concerned we are for his wellbeing.'

'We have received several calls from people who believe they may have seen Bradley since he left the party and these are being investigated but we do not have any confirmed sightings and calls to his mobile phone remain unanswered.

'Specially trained police officers have been carrying out searches of open ground and along the beach in Grays and will be concentrating their efforts today on the nature reserve off of Hogg Lane. 

This includes potentially dangerous terrain and we would ask members of the public to leave the searches of these areas to our officers.

'It is quite possible that Bradley might be lying somewhere injured and unable to move and we would ask people in Grays to help us by checking their gardens, sheds, and outbuildings for any sign of Bradley.

'We would also ask them to check alleyways near their homes and to ask friends and families that live in Grays to do the same. If they find anything of significance they should contact Grays Police Station on 101.'
