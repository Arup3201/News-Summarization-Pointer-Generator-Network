At least 10 people have been injured by piranhas in the same Argentine river where a similar attack by the carnivorous fish occurred last month.

The vicious creatures, known as palometas, have been attacking bathers since Thursday at the Parana River in Rosario, which is 186 miles north-east of Buenos Aires.

Seventy people were bitten by the shoal of meat-eating fish in late December as they attempted to cool off from the unusually high summer temperatures.

Vicious: A shoal of sharp-toothed palometas have been blamed for recent attacks on swimmers in Argentina

During that attack, a seven-year-old girl lost part of a finger, while other swimmers suffered deep cuts to their ankles, fingers and hands.

Palometas have been described as 'a type of piranha, big, voracious and with sharp teeth that can really bite.'

They have been known to target humans in Rosario before, with 40 swimmers hurt during a mass-attack in 2008.

Media reports said the latest injuries include a boy who suffered a foot wound while floating in the river.

Experts say a combination of hot weather and lower numbers of species such as caiman, which prey on the fish, could be causing the attacks.

Fatalities are however rare, with the majority of attacks occurring as nips and bites to the extremities, such as hands and feet.

Injured: A man is treated following the attack in December

Attack victim: This man sustained a bite on his foot following the vicious fish attack in the Parana River in December

Under attack: The Parana river in Rosario, where the fish have been attacking swimmers since December

On alert: The city of Rosario in Argentina, which has been subject to attacks by the piranha-like fish

Ready to bite: Piranhas have strong teeth and jaws

Piranhas are omnivorous freshwater fish native to South American rivers, but they have also been spotted in Bangladesh and China.

They are known for their sharp teeth and a voracious appetite for meat.

The exact number of piranha species is unknown, as new species continue to be discovered, but estimates range from 30 to 60.

Piranhas are normally 14cm to 26cm long, though some have been reported up to 43cm in length.

Attacks in the Amazon basin have been on the increase in recent years. In 2011, a drunk 18-year-old man was attacked and killed in Rosario del Yata, Bolivia.

In 2012, a five-year-old Brazilian girl was attacked and killed by a shoal of piranhas, while recurring attacks in Piaui in 2011 resulted in 100 people being injured.

Piranha attacks peak in the dry season when there is less food and the water levels are lower.

Fatalities are rare, with the majority of attacks taking the form of bites to the feet and hands.

Splashing tends to make piranhas more likely to attack, explaining why children are often injured during mass attacks of these creatures.
