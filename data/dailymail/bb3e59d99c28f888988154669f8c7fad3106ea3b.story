Just weeks after denying she was under any pressure to start a family, Zara Phillips looked more than a little broody as she played with her two-year-old niece over the weekend.

The 31-year-old royal was seen laughing uproariously at the Beaufort Hunt Point-to-Point races in Gloucestershire on Saturday while swinging her brother's child Savannah around in the spring sunshine.

Zara was joined at the event by her mother Princess Anne and her former England rugby star husband Mike Tindall, to watch their horse run in the 3 o'clock race.

Her brother Peter Phillips, his 
wife Autumn Phillips and their two children, the Queen's 
great-granddaughters Savannah and Isla, who will be one on March 29, also clearly enjoyed themselves.

But disappointingly 'Fiddle Faddle', which is owned by HRH the Princess Royal 
and trained by Zara, pulled up mid-race and did not 
complete the course.

However, the star of London 2012, where she gained a silver medal for Team GB in eventing, didn't look bothered as she had fun with Savannah, carrying her around and throwing her into the air.

Only last month Zara insisted she feels no pressure to measure up to the Duchess 
of Cambridge, saying she and husband have no immediate plans to start a family.

Kate Middleton is expecting her first child with husband Prince William in July.

'Before we got married, everyone was like: “When are you going to get 
married?” Then as soon as we were, it was: “When are you having kids?” ' Zara said.

'In the future we'll see what happens, but we're not, sort of, putting a date down.'

Kate 'can win that one', she added.

Zara and Mike  have recently sold their £1.2 million Georgian mansion in Cheltenham, and are living back on the Gatcombe Park Estate with her mother and brother. 

They sold their white stucco marital home earlier this month in order to live there, which had been quietly on the market for 'some time' before it was snapped up by Shaun Wills, finance director of clothing company Superdry.

Their new house, on the estate of the Princess Royal, already stables Zara's horses and is where she trains both racehorses and her three-day eventers.

The couple bought their detached house, which is on a main road but set back in its own grounds, before their wedding at Canongate Kirk, on Edinburgh's Royal Mile

Despite buying their Cheltenham home shortly after their wedding, in July 2011, Zara has always kept the home she previously lived in on her mother's estate.

And moving back home will make the estate even more of a family affair - with Zara's brother Peter, his wife Autumn and their two daughters, also living there.

The house and farming estate were bought by Queen Elizabeth II in 1976 for her daughter and the husband Captain Mark Phillips.

Now the Princess Royal lives in the large manor house with her second husband, Sir Timothy Laurence, while Mark lives in the adjoining Aston Farm with his second wife.
