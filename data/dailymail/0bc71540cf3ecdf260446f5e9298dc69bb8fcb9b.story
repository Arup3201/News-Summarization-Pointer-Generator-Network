A ‘last ditch’ drug for prostate cancer sufferers is to be axed from NHS use.

Jevtana gives men with advanced disease at least three extra months of life – but some have survived three or more years.

The Cancer Drugs Fund plans to remove the drug from its approved list effective from March because of weak cost-effectiveness.

Although it will remain available for existing patients, doctors will be unable to prescribe it for hundreds of men with the disease.

More than 40,000 men are diagnosed with prostate cancer each year in Britain, and over 10,000 die of it.

Critics say the UK still lags behind Germany, France and Italy in prescribing life-prolonging medicines to cancer patients and the situation will get worse.

Jevtana is among 25 drugs being re-evaluated by the Cancer Drugs Fund, originally set up to improve access to vital medicines in England, which will issue a full list of those being de-listed next week.

The decision to stop NHS use of Jevtana – it has already been rejected by the rationing body NICE – follows news that six breast cancer drugs prescribed for thousands of women are also set to be axed.

Some men whose prostate cancer has spread will have no other treatment option.

Dr Alison Birtle, consultant clinical oncologist at Lancashire Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, said the decision was a travesty.

She said ‘As a doctor who treats men with advanced prostate cancer, I am deeply saddened and my patients will be devastated by this decision.

Jevtana, also called Cabazitaxel is a drug used to treat advanced prostate cancer when the cancer can no longer be controlled by hormonal therapy.

Jevtana is given to people after they've already been treated with the chemotherapy drug docetaxel.

It is usually given in the chemotherapy day unit or during a short stay in hospital, by a chemotherapy nurse.

‘In my every day experience, Jevtana has given some men with advanced prostate cancer extra time.

'Some of the men that I started to treat with Jevtana 3 to 4 years ago are still alive today – and most importantly this time has been of good quality, allowing them to carry on doing the things they enjoy despite their cancer.’

The drug costs around £22,000 for a one-off course of treatment and about 500 patients a year have got it via the CDF.

The £280million a year Cancer Drugs Fund (CDF) which began in April 2011 has led to around 55,000 patients in England getting drugs banned on the NHS by Nice, the rationing body.

The Government's aim, which was a Tory election pledge, was to enable NHS doctors to prescribe any drug if they believed a cancer patient could benefit.

NHS England last year took over administration of the CDF, which is due to be wound up in 2016.

Sandy Tyndale-Biscoe, of the prostate cancer patients’ charity Tackle, said ‘In recent years, earlier diagnosis and better treatments have led to great improvements in the treatment of advanced prostate cancer and in survival.

Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men in the UK, with over 40,000 new cases diagnosed every year. Picture, are human prostate cancer cells under the microscope

‘By removing a key treatment available for this group of patients who are resistant to hormone therapies, NHS England has failed to honour its commitment to people with cancer who have no other options.’

Owen Sharp, Chief Executive of Prostate Cancer UK said: ‘The very fact that cancer drugs face being struck off the government’s additional funding pot in the first place is a symptom of a much deeper problem: the cancer drug appraisal and funding systems are broken.’ 

CDF chair Professor Peter Clark said ‘We need to get maximum value for every pound we spend through the CDF.

‘We can no longer sustain a position where we are funding drugs that don't offer sufficient clinical benefit when drugs that will do more for patients are coming on stream.’
