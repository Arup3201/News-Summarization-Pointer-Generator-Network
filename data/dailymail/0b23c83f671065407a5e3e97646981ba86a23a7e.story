Senior NBC executives have met to discuss what to do next about the growing Brian Williams crisis after further examples  of his apparent habit of embellishing and exaggerating old stories to make himself look better emerged over the weekend

Williams, who not only hosts NBC Nightly News but is also managing editor of the country’s highest rated newscast, announced on Saturday that he was taking a temporary leave of absence after questions arose over his admission to making false on-air statements that he was in a helicopter hit by a rocket-propelled grenade while in Iraq in 2003.

But if Williams hoped that move might take the heat of him, he was sorely mistaken after new reports emerged casting doubts on old claims that he had experienced a similar close call in Israel in 2006 and been robbed at gunpoint in the sleepy New Jersey suburb of Red Bank in the 1970s.

With much at stake for parent company NBCUniversal, CEO Steve Burke is reported to have held a meeting with NBC News executives at his house on Sunday to discuss what to do, reports Politico.

The network has so far refused to comment on when or whether Williams will return and who will decide his future, although NBC News announced on Friday that an internal investigation had been launched.

By Sunday night - and with the scandal not looking like going away anytime soon - the embattled news anchor announced that he was backing out of an appearance on David Letterman's Late Show scheduled for Thursday.

Williams had spread the story of his helicopter being under attack during a previous Late Show interview with Letterman in 2013.  

Former Today show host Katie Couric has been rumored as a possible replacement for Williams, but on Monday she denied any interest in taking over as Nightly News anchor.  

'Been out of pocket – any rumors about me and NBC completely untrue. Wishing my friends at my former home the best during this tough time,' she tweeted. 

In a 2007 interview with Fairfield University Student Television, Williams claims that he was close enough to stare down the barrel of an RPG that had been fired at his helicopter in Iraq in 2003

Since Williams' initial apology on Wednesday, questions have been raised about several previous claims including that he saw a body or bodies in the Hurricane Katrina floodwaters that hit New Orleans in 2005.

His remarks in a 2006 interview drew suspicion because there was relatively little flooding in New Orleans' French Quarter, the area where Williams was staying.

On Sunday fresh footage emerged of him lying yet again about the 2003 Iraq war story that has got him into so much hot water days earlier.

In a 2007 interview with Fairfield University Student Television Williams repeated his claim that a rocket-propelled grenade was fired at his helicopter before claiming that he had been close enough to stare down the barrel of the weapon. 

'I looked down the tube of an RPG that had been fired at us and had hit the chopper in front of ours. And I'm so fortunate to be sitting here,' Williams told his young interviewer prior to a speaking engagement at the campus.

During the same interview Williams also recalls a close call in Israel in 2006 when he also claims he was lucky to escape rocket fire, reports Mediaite.

'I've been very lucky to have survived a few things that I've been involved in,' said Williams in 2007.

Staying off air: Brian Williams has cancelled an appearance on Late Night with David Letterman. He an appearance in 2013 he gave a false account of how a helicopter he was in was hit by an RPG in Iraq

'The war with Hezbollah in Israel a few years back where there were Katyusha rockets passing just underneath the helicopter I was riding in.'

Yet Williams' original report on the July 2006 incident tells a rather less dramatic version of events.

It does not reference anything close to rockets passing 'just beneath' his chopper and nor does he make any claims about being lucky to be alive.

'The trails of smoke and dust visible out the window are where Katyusha rockets have landed - in this case in the uninhabited Israeli countryside, and in some cases they have set fire to the surrounding brush. The missiles are unguided and random. And plentiful,' writes Williams.

'Then, I noticed something out the window. From a distance of six miles, I witnessed a rocket launch. A rising trail of smoke, then a second rocket launch, an orange flash and more smoke — as a rocket heads off toward Israel.'

But, in the 2007 interview, he told the student: 'I've been very, very lucky the way my life has turned out.' 

Another old story often repeated by Williams about his bravery growing up in a quiet New Jersey suburb is being questioned by local residents in the light of his admission that he lied about taking enemy fire in Iraq.

Local residents in the sleepy New Jersey suburb of Red Bank are questioning the credibility of a story Williams told Esquire magazine in 2005 about being mugged at gunpoint during the 1970s.

Williams recalls being left 'looking up at a thug's snub-nosed .38 while selling Christmas trees out of the back of a truck.'

According to his story he was trying to help a local church when the thief grabbed his money.

'That wasn't a bad job, until a guy came up and stuck a .38-caliber pistol in my face and made me hand over all the money. Merry Christmas, right? Of course, I suddenly appreciated the other jobs I thought I hated,' Williams recalled when he told New Jersey Monthly in 2008.

But several longtime Red Bank residents aren't convinced by Williams' claims.

'I would highly doubt he's telling the truth,' Danny Murphy told the New York Post.

'I find it hard to believe anyone was held up in this area in the '70s. It was very safe,' said Murphy who owned a restaurant just a few blocks from where Williams claims he was accosted.

The Post spoke to several residents who recall the area being so safe at the time that kids could walk around alone at night on their own.

'It was never dangerous here,' said Yolanda DeMaria, 93. 'It was a very peaceful town, a lovely town. It was a small town with a dress shop and a five-and-dime. No one locked their cars.'

Another local resident also found Williams' claims difficult to take seriously.

'Don't listen to Brian Williams,' said Les Carbone, 85. 'He's going to tell you a lot of things. I doubt he was robbed at gunpoint. I was born in Red Bank, there were no crimes like that. Tell Brian Williams to stop lying.' 

In a memo on Saturday to NBC News staff, that was released by the network, the anchorman had said that it had become 'painfully apparent' that he has become a distracting news story.

Williams announced that was taking himself off the broadcast for several days with weekend anchor Lester Holt set to fill in.

'Made a mistake recalling': Williams, shown left in Iraq and right in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, has found his claims met with scrutiny

A source told the DailyMail.com Williams will not be involved in any of the day-to-day editing of the program during his absence.

It has been repeatedly reported that NBC executives were warned a year ago about Williams constantly inflating his biography.

The New York Times reports that it had got to the point where it was a joke in the news division but 'there was no one around to pull his chain when he got too over-the-top'.

NBC News refused to comment Saturday on when or whether Williams would return and who would decide his future. Williams, however, said he would be back.

'In the midst of a career spent covering and consuming news, it has become painfully apparent to me that I am presently too much a part of the news, due to my actions,' Williams said in his memo.

'Upon my return, I will continue my career-long effort to be worthy of the trust of those who place their trust in us,' he wrote.

There was no indication by Williams, who has anchored NBC Nightly News since 2004, that an absence was forthcoming during his newscast on Friday. He signed off as he usually does, saying he hoped people would be back to see him on Monday.

Holt did mention Williams' leave in Saturday's newscast.

'A word tonight about our colleague Brian Williams, who you may know has been under scrutiny this past week over his recollection of certain stories he's covered,' Holt said before reading Williams' memo to viewers.

Nightly News has reigned as the top-rated evening newscast over its competition on CBS and ABC.

Williams' importance to NBC News goes beyond his anchor status, said Al Tompkins, a faculty member for broadcast and online at The Poynter Institute, a journalism think tank.

'He sets the tone of the network. It may not be as critical as when (Walter) Cronkite was CBS' anchor, in every way, but he is more than a face,' he said.

Williams' absence itself is a delicate challenge, according to Tompkins.

'He can't be gone long. The timing will be critical - too short and it won't seem like he has taken himself out of the game long enough, and too long and he looks like damaged goods,' he said.
