Super model Kate Moss has been super busy lately landing jobs as the face of Versace and St Tropez, posing on the cover of Allure magazine ... and now designing a range of phone accessories for Carphone Warehouse.

The High Street phone brand might not be as glamorous as her usual collaborations, but no doubt the deal to lend her name to a 'fash-tech' collection for the company is helping to pay for her recent string of luxury holidays.

And, as demonstrated in the designs unveiled today, fashion's most famous face has managed to inject some serious style in to the everyone's favourite accessory.

Kate Moss has designed an accessory range for Carphone Warehouse

The accessories feature a small anchor, inspired by a tattoo Kate has on her right wrist

The collection draws inspiration from the style icon’s own wardrobe and is intended to capture her classic, understated style in a range of leather and metallic cases.

The designs are simple and subtle and all come in the fash pack's favourite colour: black.

They include a patent crocodile skin design with gold
 embellishment that Kate designed around her favourite vintage lighter; a
 bold metallic, star case that was inspired by a diamond necklace from 
Kate’s jewellery box; and the simple anchor emblem taken from a tattoo on her wrist that has become her personal monogram across the whole range.

Kate Moss said, 'The range is a reflection of my personal style and every piece was inspired by something I already own and wear.  After spending time designing each piece individually, I’ve loved seeing the range and my vision come to life.

Julian Diment, Marketing Director at Carphone Warehouse comments, 'We’re excited to see our customers’ reaction when the range goes on sale next week. We know they’ve been waiting for a credible, fashion line for their phones and Kate has really delivered. Our design team is already hard at work with Kate on the next collection, and exploring the full potential of "fashion-tech".'

Last month pictures were released of 
Kate meeting with the Carphone Warehouse team to discuss her collection,
 which is  geared towards 'fashion conscious smartphone users'.

Kate Moss’s latest career move is a bit more down to earth than her usual high fashion jobs.

Miss Moss, who has posed for exclusive designers including Chanel and Burberry, is working on the range for an undisclosed fee.

The company recruited the model in a bid to cash in on what it calls ‘fashion tech’ – or phone 
accessories aimed at customers who ‘are crying out’ for something more 
stylish than cheap plastic cases.

For
 Moss, it may lack the glamour of strutting the catwalks in Paris or 
Milan, but Carphone believes adding her touch to the humble phone case 
will tempt female customers who see her as a style icon.

Decisions decisions: The collection, due to launch later in the summer, will combine Kate's love of all things fashion with technology

A lucrative four year partnership with
 Sir Philip Green at Topshop, reported to have earned her more than 
£3million, ended in 2010.

She
 no longer acts as the face of Mango, the Spanish clothing chain, with 
Australian supermodel Miranda Kerr, a decade younger, starring in its 
latest campaign.

Although 
still a very high earner, Moss’s income appears to have been falling. 
According to an estimate of her wealth in American business magazine in 
Forbes last summer, she earned £6.3million in the previous 12 months, 
compared with £8.9m in 2010/11.

Moss said: ‘My phone’s as much a part of my look as my bag or shoes, and yet there’s so little choice out there.’
