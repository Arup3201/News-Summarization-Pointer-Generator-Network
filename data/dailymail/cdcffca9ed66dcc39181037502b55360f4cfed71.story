Hackers associated with the
Chinese government have repeatedly infiltrated the computer
systems of U.S. airlines, technology companies and other firms
involved in the movement of U.S. troops and military equipment,
a U.S. Senate panel has found.

The Senate Armed Services Committee's year-long probe,
details of which were made public on Wednesday, found that the
military's U.S. Transportation Command, or Transcom, was aware
of only two out of at least 20 such cyber intrusions within a
single year.

The committee's investigation also found gaps in reporting
requirements and a lack of information sharing among U.S.
government entities. 

That in turn left the U.S. military largely
unaware of computer compromises of its contractors, it found.

A US Senate report says there were about 50 hacker intrusions into a single military contractor's computers over a 12-month period

'Unit 61398' of the Peoples Liberation Army of China is reportedly the site of origin for hacking attacks, but the Chinese government denies it

'These peacetime intrusions into the networks of key defense
contractors are more evidence of China's aggressive actions in
cyberspace,' Democratic Senator Carl Levin of Michigan, the
committee's chairman, said in releasing the report.

The investigation focused on the U.S. military's ability to
seamlessly tap into civilian air, shipping and other
transportation assets for rapid troop deployments and the timely
arrival of supplies from food to ammunition to fuel.

In a 12-month period beginning June 1, 2012, there were
about 50 intrusions or other cyber events into the computer
networks of Transcom contractors, the 52-page report stated.

At least 20 of those were successful intrusions attributed
to an 'advanced persistent threat,' a term used to designate
sophisticated threats commonly associated with governments. 

All
of those intrusions were attributed to China, the report stated.

Senate Jim Inhofe of Oklahoma, the committee's top
Republican, called for a 'central clearinghouse' that makes it
easy for contractors, especially small businesses, to report
suspicious cyber activity.

Among the investigation's discoveries was that a 'Chinese
military intrusion' into a Transcom contractor between 2008 and
2010 'compromised emails, documents, user passwords and computer code.' 

At least 20 cy ber attacks were attributed to an 'advanced persistent threat' and linked to China

In 2012, an intrusion was made into multiple systems of a
commercial ship contracted by Transcom, the report said.

The Senate probe could further increase tensions between the
two world powers over cyber spying.

Officials with the Chinese embassy in Washington were not
immediately available to comment.

The results of the investigation were revealed months after
U.S. authorities in May charged five Chinese military officers
and accused them of hacking into American nuclear, metal and
solar companies to steal trade secrets.

Last month, Community Health Systems, one of the
largest U.S. hospital groups, said Chinese hackers had stolen
Social Security numbers and other personal data from some 4.5
million patients.
