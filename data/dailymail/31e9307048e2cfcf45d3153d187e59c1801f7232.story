As the warmer weather arrives, so do the pervs.

The latest sicko revealed by cops in Los Angeles is registered sex offender Mylyn Corniche Johnson, a 29-year-old whom police say has been recording up hundreds of women’s skirts or dresses with his cellphone.

In one instance he pretended to be a security guard and conducted a 'search' using his phone.

In custody: Mylyn Corniche Johnson, 29. After reviewing footage taken by the registered sex offender and contacting 10 victims they could identify, investigators said they are still looking for more than 100 teen girls and women

A woman in the Target store told security that she had spotted Johnson filming up an 'unsuspecting' customer's skirt.

He was held by store security until cops arrived.

Upon checking his phone, authorities found more than 100 women had been taped by the suspect ranging from teenagers to ladies in their 50s.

Detectives say Johnson filmed his victims in charity shops, shopping malls and on Metrolink trains.

Discreet: The upskrit footage was taken with a regular cameraphone being held at Johnson's side

Engage: Police say Johnson would talk to his victims in order for him to record more footage

The Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department later found more than 3,200 up-skirt videos, which featured more than 100 unidentified women, on Johnson’s iPhone and on an external hard drive at his home.

The police say that he had been carrying out the covert filming since last summer, at least.

When cops challenged Johnson, he told them he was an entertainment exec or a tattoo artist but authorities knew that he was a registered sex offender.

During one incident at a K-Mart Store in Lancaster, California, Johnson detained a woman from shoplifting in the store by pretending he was a security officer.

Locations: Most of the footage was taken in places like Target, K-Mart and even on the subway system

Multiple videos: Police say they have only been able to identify ten of the women so far but believe there to be at least 100 in total

He ordered her to expose part of her buttocks under the guise that he was searching her.

He captured the entire incident on his cellphone.

Johnson faced multiple charges including allegations of false imprisonment, burglary, and unlawful recording of underwear, sheriff's officials said.

After reviewing the footage for two months and contacting 10 victims they could identify, investigators said they are still looking for more than 100 teen girls and women.

On several occasions, Johnson would also talk to the women he was taping, identifying himself as a tattoo artist, a rap musician, or being with 'Loyal Luck Television.'

Anyone who believes they may have been a victim of Johnson was encouraged to contact the sheriff’s Special Victims Bureau at (877) 710-5273 or via email at SpecialVictims@lasd.org.
