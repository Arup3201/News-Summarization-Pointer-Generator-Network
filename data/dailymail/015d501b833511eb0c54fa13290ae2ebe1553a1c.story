Three babies have died from an infection in the same neonatal unit at a hospital in Northern Ireland.

Staff are clearing the room where the infants were treated at the Royal Maternity Hospital in Belfast, after finding all three deaths were caused by a bacteria called pseudomonas.

Other vulnerable babies have been swabbed for signs of the infection,  and the room will undergo deep-cleaning over the weekend as staff try to find the source of the infection.

An investigation has been launched after three babies died at the Royal Jubilee Maternity Service

Two heavily pregnant women  have had 
to travel from Northern  Ireland to Dublin to have  their babies because
of the deadly outbreak.

The expectant mothers were due to give
birth at the Royal Hospital in west Belfast, but were forced to endure 
the 100-mile journey after pseudomonas struck the neonatal unit.

The parents of the 23 babies left in 
the unit, which is used to treat extremely premature and small infants, 
are now anxiously awaiting test results.

The mother of one baby girl said: 
‘She’s just seven weeks old and was born at just 24 weeks, weighing just
one pound seven ounces.

‘She has come so far, past illness and the fact that she could get sick again – we really don’t want to think about it.

‘It takes about 48 hours for results 
to come back so hopefully we’ll find out today.’ The bacteria can cause 
infections in the chest, blood and urinary tract.

Consultant Clifford Mayes said: ‘Where
it is possible, we will transfer a mother and  baby out before delivery
to other hospitals.

‘The large area with 13  babies is being deep-cleaned. There are only three babies remaining in that room.’

Northern Ireland health minister Edwin Poots has urged parents not to panic

The first baby died on January 6 and the second on January 13. The third infant died late on Thursday night.

Doctors first became aware that there 
was a problem with the infection on Monday night, after test results 
came back for the second baby. Mr Mayes said: ‘Every baby has been 
screened with skin swabs, looking for any evidence of pseudomonas.

‘It is a germ which can be on your skin and not cause any harm but with a sick patient it can cause very serious problems.

‘The babies now are being moved depending on results as they come back.’

Pseudomonas is not itself infectious 
but because it exists in water or moisture patients can carry it on 
their skin. It can be treated with the right antibiotic, but the third 
baby died despite the treatment.

The bacteria infects the lungs of those with weak immune systems and  causes breathing problems.

Belfast Health and Social Care Trust 
chief executive Colm Donaghy said: ‘The trust will be carrying out a 
full investigation and an analysis over the circumstances over this 
period to see exactly what did happen and if there’s anything else that
we could have done.

‘Our first priority at this point in time is the safety of the babies.’

A large intensive care room which can take up to 13 babies is in the process of being cleared.

The infants are being separated into small rooms and the deep-clean will be carried out over the weekend.

Dr Mayes said it would be some time 
before other information about the outbreak was collated, as blood 
samples take 48 hours to be analysed.

Edwin Poots, the Northern Ireland health minister, said the authorities were taking the matter very seriously.

‘It is important that we remain calm. 
Infection control teams are now in the process of trying to identify the
source of the infection and minimise the risk of spread to other babies
in the unit.’

Some babies may be moved to other health trusts or even outside Northern Ireland if the pressure becomes too great.

It will take at least a week to find out if the deaths were related to different strains of the infection.

Between 3,700 and 4,000 cases are 
reported to the Health Protection Agency every year. There are usually 
fewer than 80 cases of it annually across Northern Ireland. a

Pseudomonas aeruginosa magnified hundreds of times: The bacteria is dangerous to those with vulnerable immune systems

Pseudomonas is bacteria which multiplies in the lungs of people whose immune systems are weakened by illness or medication, or have lung conditions like Cystic Fibrosis (CF).

It is found in many natural places including plants, soil, surface orstagnant water and warm moist environments. It can also be found on food, taps, in sink reservoirs, bath toys, pools, jacuzzis, hot tubs and flower water.

Pseudomonas can be spread from one person another person via unwashed hands. It can live on hands and surfaces for up to two and a half hours.

Symptoms of a Pseudomonas chest infection can include increasedcoughing and tiredness. It is usually detected by cough swab or sputum specimen.

The treatment for Pseudomonas is an antibiotic given through a nebuliser for three months twice a day after physiotherapy, along with a three week course of antibiotics.

Sometimes it can be difficult to treat the Pseudomonas, due to a slimy barrier the bacteria forms around itself. It can also become resistant to some antibiotics.

Sometimes intravenous antibiotics may need to be given if the condition persists to try and prevent the bacteria damaging the lung tissue and becoming permanent.
