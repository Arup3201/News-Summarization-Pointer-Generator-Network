Teens learning to drive are used to their parents watching their every step.

However, one California couple has raised the bar with a hi-tech monitor than can analyse every detail of their 16 year old son's drives - and automatically tell both him and them where he's going wrong.

Californians Jaideep and Sandhya Jain decided to take matters into their own hands after realising their son was about to start learning - and first invented the device first themselves.

The Truvolo app and the small transmitted that plugs into the car

The Truvolo Drive is a small device that plugs in to a car's standard diagnostic port.

It comes with a free app that users install on their smart phone.

The Truvolo app communicates via Bluetooth with the Drive to collect data while they drive and sends it to Truvolo’s secure platform.

The platform does all the number crunching and converts the raw data into information that is actually useful to users.

It took a year to put the plan together and launch the company, and throughout the process, their son Anoop was using the device, which can send data on driving patterns to an app.

The firm is now accepting preorders - and luckily still has a test subject in the family.

'Our son is 16 now, and actually got his license a few weeks ago,' Mr Jain told MailOnline.

'He is using it - and actually says he's learning quite a bit, and it really gives us peace of mind as well.'

Truvolo works using a small transmitter that plugs into a car's On-Board Diagnostic port.

Using a built-in accelerometer, Truvolo takes monitors G-forces that translate to abrupt acceleration, deceleration and swerving, all of which are reported via the app at the end of each trip.

Using the driver's phones GPS, Truvolo also will automatically alert others when you've arrived at your destination.

'Know if your family, and especially teens, are driving safely,' the firm boasts.

Mr Jain said the firm will produce two versions - one for families, and one for corporate fleet managers.

'We are focused on the family fleet - it can work across multiple cars, and the app can show all our children.

The app can give each drive a score - and tell parents how their child is doing

'For instance, in our family we have three cars and three drivers - and I can see data from all of them in the app.

The project is now for preorders, and the first products are expected to ship in July.

Anoop's mother and the company's co-founder Sandhya said she came up with the idea while driving him to school.

'Over a year ago during an early morning drive to my son’s high school, he reminded me that within a year he could be driving his own car,' said Sandhya.

'This got me thinking. Would he drive safely? What if he didn’t? Would I even know? With all the technology inside today’s cars wouldn’t it be nice to know what is going on with the car when I am not riding in it?'

She said after carrying out some research, the pair realised there was a niche in the market.

'I found that although there were a few products out there that deal with parts of this puzzle, there was no complete and affordable solution out there to bridge the gap between the data available in my car and my daily life.'

Jaideep and Sandhya, 46, Indian emigrants who met pursuing computer science master's degrees at Kansas State University, decided to build a suitable gadget themselves.

It can also show alerts such and low fuel or when the engine needs checking

Another key feature of Truvolo’s solution is the ability to track car performance.

Users receive information from a vehicle’s internal system providing information on items such as the check engine light or fuel efficiency.

'Over 75% of car owners we’ve talked to use the sticker on the windshield to track their routine maintenance schedule,' the firm says.

'Truvolo is replacing that service sticker and putting the power and control back into the hands of the car owner.

'With Truvolo, users will have unprecedented insight into their vehicles which may not only save them money, but potentially their lives.'
