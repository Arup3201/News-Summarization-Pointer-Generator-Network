With just four days to go until the start of the new Barclays Premier League season there are still gaping holes in many clubs' squads. As the countdown to action continues Sportsmail has picked out the biggest problem positions of all in the top flight and identifies the transfer targets each club have pinpointed to plug the gaps.

ARSENAL

Problem position: defender

Solution: Kostas Manolas (Olympiacos)

Cost: £8million

Arsenal need a defender to replace Thomas Vermaelen. They wanted Chris Smalling and have designs on Matija Nastasic but Manolas would be good value for money.

BURNLEY

Problem position: striker

Solution: Troy Deeney (Watford)

Cost: £10m

Chances are slim of buying Deeney from Watford considering Burnley's budget. They need cover for Danny Ings and Sam Vokes if they are to have a chance of staying up.

LEICESTER CITY

Problem position: defensive midfield

Solution: Esteban Cambiasso

Cost: Free (but big wages)

Experience and class of such a calibre could protect Leicester's defence as they adjust to the Premier League, which will be a key factor in their survival bid.

LIVERPOOL

Problem position: striker

Solution: Samuel Eto'o

Cost: Free

The departure of Luis Suarez and injury to Adam Lallana leave Liverpool short of options for someone who can play off a striker or lead the line while adding experience for their European campaign.

Familiar face: Samuel Eto'o spent last season scoring goals at Stamford Bridge with Chelsea

MANCHESTER UNITED

Problem position: centre back

Solution: Marcos Rojo (Sporting Lisbon)

Cost: £18m

Playing three at the back will test the dubious injury record of messrs Jones, Smalling and Evans at United. Van Gaal needs cover and versatility which Rojo provides.

SOUTHAMPTON

Problem position: striker

Solution: Shane Long (Hull)

Cost: £12m

Graziano Pelle will carry the fight and score goals but needs an ally who knows the league and can provide support when required. Long's tireless work ethic would suit.

STOKE CITY

Problem position: winger

Solution: Nathan Redmond (Norwich)

Cost: £6m

Pace on the flanks and an improved supply line for his strikers is what Mark Hughes craves. Price has been too high for Andriy Yarmolenko and Oussama Assaidi.

Wriggling free: Nathan Redmond in action for Norwich against Wolves in the Championship on Saturday

SUNDERLAND

Problem position: striker

Solution: Fabio Borini (Liverpool)

Cost: £14m

May face late competition from Hull City for the striker but without him Sunderland face another battle with relegation. Borini needs convincing they can improve.

In demand: But Fabio Borini needs convincing that his future lies at Sunderland, rather than Liverpool

SWANSEA

Problem position: defender

Solution: Federico Fernandez (Napoli)

Cost: £8m

Deal is close to being agreed with Napoli. The Argentine was left out of Napoli's Champions League squad and a work permit is Swansea's main obstacle to replacing Chico Flores.

Wanted: Swansea are closing in on a deal for Napoli and Argentina defender Federico Fernandez (centre left)

WEST HAM

Problem position: striker

Solution: Connor Wickham (Sunderland)

Cost: £8m

Anyone who has a decent goalscoring record and stays fit is a bonus as West Ham's search for more firepower reaches crisis point.
