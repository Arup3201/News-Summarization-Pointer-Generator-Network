If you're hoping to lose a few pounds before you hit the beach in a bikini this summer then you might want to ditch regular trips to High Street coffee chains.

Many shop bought coffees have the equivalent calories to a fast food feast, with Starbucks in particular a repeat offender against dieters.

And while many may now be up to speed with how calorific hot drinks such as full fat lattes are, they may find they're not doing their waistlines any favours by instead opting for a cold drink from coffee shop summer menus.

A sensible swap? Ditching a full fat latte, left, for a strawberry frappuccino with cream won't make you slimmer this summer

It may appear healthy because it contains fruit in the title but a large Starbucks strawberry frappuccino contains  a massive  459 calories because of its cream and full-fat milk content. That's almost as many calories as a McDonald's Big Mac.

The Starbucks peppermint mocha frappuccino in verdi with whole milk and whipped cream is 540 calories.

Costa's strawberry cooler is an even worse offender - a large size with cream and full fat milk is 653 calories -  that's the same as having a MacDonald's burger and fries.

Meanwhile, Caffe Nero's whole milk caramel frappe latte is 455 calories, the equivalent to two large glasses of white wine and some pretzels.

Sales rising: More people are now turning to herbal teas as a healthier alternative to coffee shop drinks

Now that brands are under more pressure to display nutritional information on their products, consumers are becoming more savvy to the hidden calories in shop bought coffees.

As a result, sales of herbal tea is on the rise as people see them as a healthier alternative for a hot drink.

Herbal tea brand Higher Living has reported an increase in sales of 36 per cent in recent months, with customers citing that they were keen to embrace the low calorie benefits of teas. 

Most herbal teas only have a trace amount of calories while some flavours rarely exceed 35 calories.

A Higher Living spokesman said: 'It's clear that ordering your favourite coffee can have a significant 
impact on your waistline.

'Herbal teas bridge this gap between calories 
and taste. 
There's nothing wrong with the occasional coffee shop splurge, but keep 
calories low by mixing things up once in a while.'

A study by Mintel found that herbal tea drinkers believed they gained numerous health benefits from their choice of refreshment over coffee consumers.

More than half (57 per cent) said that drinking herbal tea helped them to relax while 64 per cent believe in their health benefits.
