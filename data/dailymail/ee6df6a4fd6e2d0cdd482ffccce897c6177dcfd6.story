In custody: Justin Jarrard Oliver is said to have attacked the victim while they were driving away from the fast food restaurant in West Palm Beach, Florida, on Wednesday morning

A Florida man has been arrested for allegedly beating up a woman who refused him sex after he bought her a McDonald's breakfast. 

Justin Jarrard Oliver is said to have attacked the victim while they were driving away from the fast food restaurant in West Palm Beach on Wednesday morning.

The 26-year-old was picked up by the woman, who was driving with her boyfriend, and went to place an order.

Oliver then paid the bill and the trio drove off. But the suspect then demanded sex' because he bought the food, the Palm Beach Post reported. 

She refused so Oliver allegedly grabbed her arm and tried to drag her into the back seat.

The woman held onto the steering wheel and stopped the car, but then Oliver got out and tried to pull her from the vehicle, still demanding sex. 

He allegedly punched the woman causing 'severe injuries' that included a one-and-a-half inch laceration above her left eye and numerous other cuts and abrasions, a police report stated. 

In response, the woman's boyfriend jumped on Oliver's back, allowing the victim to move the car along the road.

Her partner jumped back in and they managed to drive to St. Mary’s Medical Center where hospital staff alerted the police. 

Oliver is facing charges of felony battery and false imprisonment. He is being held on $75,000 bail. 

In 2012 he was arrested for beating up a man after his debit card had been stolen - while he was having dinner at McDonald's

The 24-year-old victim tried to take justice into his own hands by tracking down those responsible himself. 

He asked a woman about the lost card and followed her into a house when she gave him a suspicious response. 

A man told him to leave but when he refused a trio, including Oliver, allegedly beat the man up.
