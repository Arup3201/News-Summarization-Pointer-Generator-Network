Playing with food: Marilinda Hodgdon has been a food stylist since 1978, using her artistic eye to make food look as appealing as possible

A woman whose job it is to make food camera-ready has revealed the techniques behind her most mouth-watering ads.

Marilinda Hodgdon, who got her degree in ceramics and metal sculpting, has been a food stylist since 1978, using her artistic eye to make everything from ice cream to pasta look as appealing as possible.

She told ABC News that the biggest challenge of her job is not just rendering food picture-perfect, but accomplishing that while also maintaining its authenticity to the real-life product.

'If it's, say, Burger King, or a fast food chain, everything must be 
according to a standard,' she explained.

'I have to slice a tomato exactly to
 their specification; I have to use their meat and their rolls and their
 cheese and their condiments... It has to be representative of what 
the real thing is.'

A
 big part of her job is attention to detail, and Ms Hodgdon is a 
perfectionist when it comes to getting the photo exactly right.

She claims, for example, that she has 
sifted through hundreds of sesame seed buns before to find the perfect 
one for a hamburger shot.

The former sculptor, who ran a home renovation company before becoming a food stylist, says her unconventional background gave her the skills necessary to excel in the field.

Her knowledge of ceramics and 
sculpture, for instance, gave her 'a great sense of color and design and
 texture and drama' which she was able to translate into food styling.

Much like a make-up artist, she carries a
 tool bag to each job, complete with brushes, Q-tips and spray-cans 
filled with olive oil to prep her food before it gets in front of the 
camera.

There are some widely-used tricks of 
the food styling trade - like adding water to beverages before 
photographing them so that light will filter through and add sparkle.

For the most part, however, Ms Hodgdon tries to avoid these somewhat deceptive tricks, using her own creative techniques instead.

She says, for example, that a mark of a truly talented stylist in her field is being able to create a picture-perfect scoop of vanilla ice cream, which tends to melt quickly in a spotlight.

Indeed, while many stylists use mounds 
of Crisco bound together with corn syrup to simulate ice cream, she 
sticks to the real stuff, painstakingly creating a new scoop for every 
single camera take.

Some of Ms Hodgdon's work includes 
commercials for Friendly's, Applebees, Dunkin' Donuts and TGI Friday's 
as well as print ads for Publix and Cool Whip.

She's also coming out with a book detailing her life as a food stylist, with food shots styled by her and shot by photographer David Bishop.

Food styling has long been an important part of advertising and film, but the rules and regulations that stand today came about after an incident in 1970.

That year, the Federal Trade Commission launched an investigation of the Campbell Soup Company and discovered that they were photographing bowls of soup with glass marbles inside to make the liquid look chunkier.

Since then, Ms Hodgdon and her fellow food stylists have had to follow a strict set of advertising guidelines.

But that doesn't mean she doesn't get creative when it comes to getting the right food photos

When, for example, a director asked her to style meatballs so that they'd bounce when they landed on sandwich bread, Ms Hodgdon was quick on her feet.

Since meatballs are too light to bounce, 'I cooked t[them] with lead weights inside them,' she revealed.
