In an eight-and-a-half minute video message posted on YouTube, House Tea Party Caucus founder and right-wing luminary Michele Bachmann announced Wednesday morning that her career in Congress will end after the 2014 elections.

Bachmann, a four-term House member, has represented Minnesota's 6th Congressional District since 2007.

'The law limits anyone from serving as president of the United States for more than eight years,' Bachmann said in her videotaped message. 'And in my opinion - well, eight years is also long enough for an individual to serve as a representative for a specific Congressional district.'

Bachmann's marathon video sounded at times like a series of disclaimers. She insisted that campaign finance probes and her barely-there victory margin in 2012 were not factors in her decision to forgo a re-election bid in 2014

Bachmann has been dogged by allegations that she improperly spent money from a Congress-related political action committee to help with her 2012 campaign for the Republican presidential nomination.

Former campaign aides first leveled that accusation, and both the Office of Congressional Ethics and the federal Election Commission are investigating.

The FBI has also made inquiries into charges that Bachmann's presidential campaign made secret payments to Iowa Republican state Senator Kent Sorenson for help in the run-up to the 2012 Iowa Caucuses.

Former Bachmann chief of staff Andy Parrish said in a sworn statement that the congresswoman 'knew and approved' of unethical payments to Sorenson.

But Bachmann insisted in her YouTube video that her presidential campaign did nothing wrong.

Bachmann was a candidate for the GOP presidential nomination in 2012, but faltered when news surfaced that chronic Migraine headaches limited her ability to manage her day-to-day responsibilities. She bowed out in February 2012 and ran for re-election to Congress with just nine months to campaign

'It was clearly understood that compliance with all rules and regulations was an absolute necessity for my presidential campaign,' she said, 'and I have no reason to believe that that was not the case.'

Bachmann narrowly won re-election last year, beating Democrat Jim Graves by just 4,200 votes, a margin of 1.1 per cent.

Graves recently announced that he would run again next year.

Bachmann downplayed concerns that she might not be re-elected if she were to run again in 2014.

'My decision was not in any way influenced by any concerns about my being re-elected to Congress,' she said. 'If I ran I would again defeat the individual who I defeated last year.'

A Republican strategist told MailOnline early Wednesday morning that the Republican Congressional Campaign Committee would be hard pressed to put resources into a 2014 Bachmann campaign, and suggested that her pre-emptive withdrawal was at least in part related to fears that she couldn't win again without resources from her party.

HAPPIER TIMES: Bachmann appeared on 'Late Night With Jimmy Fallon' in November 2011, during the Republican presidential primary season. Former campaign aides have since accused her of making unethical payments to an Iowa state legislator for help with her failed Iowa Caucus effort

'Bachmann has a less than 50-50 chance of winning again, and she knows it,' that GOP strategist said.

'She's probably bowing out gracefully so the RNC has plenty of time to find another candidate. That way if she ever runs for office again - say, for governor of Minnesota - she won't have to worry about bridges she burned.'

Bachmann did leave open that possibility in her video.

'There is no future option or opportunity- be it directly in the political area or otherwise - that I wonâ€™t be giving serious consideration if it can help save and protect our great nation for future generations,' she said.
