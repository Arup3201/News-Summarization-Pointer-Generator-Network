What do you get the family who have everything?

Well, you could pull out all the stops with a stunning necklace of natural pearls, or maybe a photo frame perched on a jewelled ostrich egg.

If you’ve got the nerve, you could try something a little more humorous. Garden gnome or a mini chocolate castle, anyone? 

Princess Anne received this art print of her riding a moose by Canadian Charles Patcher in October last year

These were some of the presents 
detailed on the list of official gifts received by the Royal Family last
 year – providing a fascinating insight into the dilemma faced by 
dignitaries, companies and members of the public who want to hand over 
something special.

Although presents of high monetary value are discouraged, the list appears to reveal that price is no object for some.

The
 Queen was lavished with gifts by the President of the United Arab 
Emirates on a state visit in April, receiving a gold jewelled photo 
frame set on a gem-studded ostrich egg, and a five-strand pearl necklace
 made from natural pearls sourced from the Arabian Gulf.

Prince
 Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall returned from foreign tours with, 
among other gifts, a parure – a collection of matching pieces of 
jewellery such as a necklace, earrings and tiara – from the King of 
Saudi Arabia.

Clarence House last night refused to 
release further details about the gems.

But such items of great value 
are not considered to be the property of a single member of the Royal 
Family, although they are allowed to use, display or loan them.

There were also dozens of small gifts from well-meaning members of the public.

An
 art teacher at a school in India gave the couple an anamorphosis 
portrait, which appears to be distorted but reveals a hidden picture in 
the canvas when something reflective is placed on it, while a Jordanian 
film company gave a ceramic figurine of the Prince with Postman Pat.

And the Queen received a Windsor Castle and Irish State Coach made  of chocolate when she visited a Mars factory.

Princess
 Anne returned from engagements with a garden gnome, and a ‘contemporary
 art image’ of her riding a moose by Canadian artist Charles Pachter.

Her
 assistant private secretary later wrote to him saying how she was ‘most
 amused by the unique representation of her riding skills’. 

Prince
 Harry received a leather flying jacket from First Lady Michelle Obama 
when he visited Washington DC in May, and a lookalike doll made by a New
 York-based 3D printing firm.

The
 Duke and Duchess of Cambridge’s gifts were not revealed by Clarence 
House because the couple had no foreign engagements due to the duchess’s
 pregnancy.
