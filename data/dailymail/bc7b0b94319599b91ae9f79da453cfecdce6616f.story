A grandmother living in sheltered housing and who was meant to be checked on every day lay dead for three days before being discovered, it is claimed.

Sylvia Jay, 76, was only found dead after concerns were raised for her well being by a friend who hadn't seen her for several days.

She was found on her bed in her flat in Beane River View in Hertford, and now accommodation manager Sanctuary Housing are investigating the incident.

Mrs Jay's daughter, Linda Jay says Sanctuary Housing should have been sending a warden to visit her mother, who lived on her own, every day.

The 52-year-old said: ' We are in shock at the moment but we are not leaving it.

'We put my mum in warden-controlled housing so she would get a knock on her door at 9.30am every day.

'She's not been getting that knock and that knock could have saved her life.'

The last time Mrs Jay was known to have been seen was on Tuesday last week, three days before she was found.

Miss Jay said her mother had been to the doctor a few days before that for a check-up, but the tests had come back normal and there did not appear to be anything wrong with her.

She added: 'Warden-controlled housing should be a safety net for the people who are living alone. They have the responsibility to make sure these people get that knock on the door.

'Most of the people there live alone. They can fall or slip coming out the bath.

'They need that knock on the door.'

The grandmother was found by neighbour Jayne Praide, who was worried after not seeing her for some days.

Mrs Praide said that she could only access the property when another resident came by who happened to know where the keys to all the flats were.

Miss Jay explained: 'Somebody's got to take responsibility for my mum's death.

'Where was that 9.30am call?

Sanctuary Housing say they are looking into the circumstances surrounding the death of Mrs Jay, who was described as vibrant and an active member of the community

'What I will never know is if they had done that 9.30am call, there may have been a chance that they could have found my mum, taken her to hospital and saved her.'

It is understood that some time ago Sanctuary sent out a letter to residents asking them if they wanted to be visited by a warden everyday, with people being given the chance to opt out.

Until Mrs Jay died, Miss Jay had not heard of this letter and it is unknown whether her mother signed it.

But the daughter said Sanctuary should have contacted her as next of kin, as her mother was not capable of making that decision.

She said: 'If they had told me she wasn't going to get the knock, I would have said she does need it. I can't be there everyday at 9.30am.

'I can ring, but she doesn't always pick up the phone.'

Sanctuary National services manager Claire Irwin said: "Our sympathies go to Mrs Jay's family and friends and we will extend them every support and assistance at this very difficult time.

'We are looking into the circumstances and will keep the family fully informed. Mrs Jay was a vibrant and active member of our community and will be greatly missed.'
