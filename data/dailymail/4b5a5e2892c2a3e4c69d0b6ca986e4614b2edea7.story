Just when you thought parking inspectors were the most-hated profession around, in come the 'odor investigators'.

Pot smokers in Denver, Colorado - where the limited sale, possession and growth of recreational marijuana is legal - have had their noses put out of joint recently by Public Health agents dubbed the 'Nasal Rangesr', whose job is to sniff them out.

Denver Department of Environmental Health officer Ben Siller uses his 'smellescrope' - proper name Olfactometer - to detect marijuana odor and then investigate whether the law has been broken based on the strength of the smell.

Siller acts on complaints that are filed by people who report strong smells of the drug.

Complaints about pot smells doubled in Denver from 2010 to 2012.

Take a big wiff: 'Nasal Rangers' have become an increased presence in Denver since the decriminalization of recreational marijuana, which has seen complaints of 'pot smells' double

But backers of Amendment 64 - the monumental Colorado bill that legalized the use of marijuana in the state - say it is unconstitutional.

Siller, who has been investigating odor complaints (not restricted to marijuana) for 26 years, told 7News that his job is primarily to call out businesses that grow marijuana and are affecting neighbors and passers-by with the plant's stench.

His job, he says, is not to track down smokers enjoying legal weed in the privacy of their homes.

According to the Denver Post, the odor has to reach a level of 8:1 in order to receive a fine of $2000.

Such a violation has not been reported since 1994.

'It has to be a very strong odor,' Siller said.

Field of grass: The primary focus of 'Nasal Rangers' is to use their smellescope to find growth plants, such as this one, and determine if any laws have been broken

The Nasal Ranger is a portable odor detecting and measuring instrument that can quantify odor strength in ambient air, according to device developers St. Croix Sensory.

They cost about $1,500 and are used to detect the strength of other smells also, such a wood fire pizza shop that is creating too much smoke.

A major issue in Denver at the moment is a proposal to make the very smell of marijuana a public crime.

The city council have considered a ban to stop the odor drifting over fences into neighbors homes or being smelt in popular areas, such as the 16th Street Mall.

'Odor can be subject' said Mary Beth Susman, Council President.

'It's hard to legislate odor.

'The strength that is required to register on the Nasal Ranger is something we need to look at.

'I also wonder if people will get used to the smell (now it's legal) and the dislike of it now may change over time.'

The first recreational marijuana shops are expected to open in Colorado on Jan. 1, 2014. While it means weed will be available in the retail sphere, the law will still only permit it to be smoked in private

A64 states that adults can possess up to an ounce of pot, can grow as many as six marijuana plants at home (with only three flowering at any given time), but home-grown marijuana can only be for personal use and cannot be sold.

However, adults can gift one another up to an ounce of pot.

The first recreational marijuana shops are expected to open on Jan. 1, 2014.

Another spike in complaints of the smell of marijuana is expected around that time.
