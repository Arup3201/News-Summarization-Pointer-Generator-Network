Just over one year ago, comedian Fiona O'Loughlin used a fake name to check into a hotel where she tried to commit suicide. 

O'Loughlin's youngest daughter Mary couldn't find her and knew something was wrong, so she set out to track her mother down.

'I had gone missing and she just went to the hotel and asked for me and they said, "No, she's not here",' O'Loughlin told the ABC.

Comedian Fiona O'Loughlin, 50, says her daughter Mary saved her from suicide

O'Loughlin opens up about her battle with alcoholism and depression on Australian Story

'Mary just knew in her heart that I was there and she would not leave.

'She described what I looked like and sure enough I was there.'

The 50-year-old mother of five was battling depression and a severe dependence on alcohol and she believes her daughter's actions saved her life.

Now over one year sober, O'Loughlin will share her story of depression, alcoholism and recovery on tonight's episode of Australian Story.

In her signature self-deprecating manner, O'Laughlin speaks frankly about suicide, her marriage breakdown and the effect her alcohol problem has had on her children.

O'Loughlin was a housewife living in Alice Springs when she decided she wanted to become a stand-up comedian at the age of 36.

The stand-up comedian could not perform without drinking two small bottles of vodka before going on stage

By her late 30s she had built up a successful international career as a stand-up comic, but in that time she had also developed a deep dependence on alcohol.

'What when wrong was at the very, very beginning my career never ever going on stage without some Dutch courage,' she told the ABC.

'It used to be a double shot, but you're doing a festival for a month and a double shot doesn't cut it anymore, and then festivals back to back...'

O'Loughlin says her new career accelerated her descent into alcoholism.

'I think possibly I would have become an alcoholic anyway, I certainly can't blame stand up, but I certainly think I fast-tracked myself,' she said.

In 2009 O'Loughlin's hidden problem became very public when she passed out on stage in front of 450 people at a show in Brisbane. She is pictured here in 2010

Before going on stage O'Loughlin needed to drink two small bottles of vodka.

She even stopped drinking socially, but could not shake the need to get drunk before a performance.

'The problem was for me that I still had this utter belief for such a long time… Until a year ago I still believed that I needed a double vodka before I went on,' she said. 

The 50-year-old  started receiving treatment from a psychiatrist last year and has been sober for 14 months

'And I used to hide these bloody little vodka bottles, and it's kind of an OCD thing too, I had to have them.

'I'd hide them in my bras, isn't that crazy, and I knew it was crazy.'

But in 2009 her hidden problem became very public when she passed out on stage in front of 450 people at a show in Brisbane.

'And as much as I laughed that off with my colleagues, you know very Judy Garland of me, that's shocking.'

Last year, after the incident with her daughter in a hotel room, she started receiving treatment from a psychiatrist and the Albert Road Clinic in Melbourne.

O'Loughlin says the support from her five children has been 'amazing' but she knows her alcoholism has taken its toll on them.

'It's been something we've all gone through together, and they cheer me on and they're so beautiful,' she said.

'I said to one of them "You're going to get really angry about this at some point", she's 17 and your mother frightened you for about five years of your teenage years.'

But O'Loughlin says making it to the one-year sobriety milestone in August this year was 'beyond thrilling'.

'When I got to a year it was just so exciting because now I understand my audience is so much safer,' she said.

'I go out of my way never to have a drink before a show like I've never done before.

'This past year's just been the joy of joys because you're suddenly so in control and having that universe let me know that I wasn't a fake.'
