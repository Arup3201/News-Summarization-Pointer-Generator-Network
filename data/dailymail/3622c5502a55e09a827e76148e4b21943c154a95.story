A healthy Italian woman paid a Swiss right-to-die clinic to take her life because she was 'unhappy about losing her looks'. 

Oriella Cazzanello, 85, travelled to a clinic in Basel, Switzerland, where she paid €10,000 for an assisted suicide.

The elderly woman, who was in good mental and physical health, disappeared from her home in Arzignano, near Vicenza in northern Italy, without telling her relatives where she was going.

Oriella Cazzanello , 85, who committed suicide using a Swiss euthanasia centre, because she was depressed about losing her looks. Her family only found out about her death ashes and a death certificate were posted to her lawyer in Italy

Building of the assisted suicide clinic, Dignitas in Pfaeffikon near Zurich, one of the major assisted suicide clinics that exist in Switzerland. Dignitas is the largest non-physician assisted suicide group in Switzerland, and is well known because of it's involvement in many British euthanasia cases

Her family, who had reported her to the police as missing, only learnt of her death after they received her ashes and death certificate from the clinic.

Mrs Cazzanello chose to end her life because she was ‘weighed down by ageing and the inevitable loss of the looks of which she was proud’ the Italian news agency ANSA reported.

The well-to-do pensioner was also suffering from loneliness.

Her brother and other relatives had not heard from her since the end of January, but were not unduly concerned, as Mrs Cazzanello, was an ‘independent’ person who would often take herself on spa weekends.

Assisted suicide amongst Britons and members of the EU has long been a controversial issue. In 2006, the Daily Mail reported the story of Anne Turner who ended her life to escape life with an incurable brain disease in a heartbreaking case which set the debate over assisted suicide raging

But as the days went passed they became worried and reported her as missing to the police.

Earlier this week her lawyer received her ashes and death certificate by post and broke the devastating news.

Assisted suicide is legal in Switzerland even if the person requesting it is not terminally ill.

Although legal in Switzerland, assisted suicide is a criminal offence in the UK and carries a maximum prison sentence of 14 years.

16 per cent of those who travel to a suicide clinic had no serious health problem, but had become ‘weary of life’, a study by the University of Bern found this week.

More than 200 Brits have died at Swiss suicide clinics in the past decade.

Top orchestral conductor Sir Edward Downes, 85, and his 74-year-old wife Joan died at the Dignitas clinic in 2009.

Lady Downes had terminal cancer while her husband was nearly blind and becoming increasingly deaf.

Daniel James, 23, who was paralysed in a rugby accident, became the youngest Briton to die at the clinic in 2010.

His parents Julie and Mark James said the ex-England under-16 rugby player had repeatedly said he wanted to die.
