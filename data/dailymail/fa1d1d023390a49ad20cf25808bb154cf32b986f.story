Two Florida teacher's aides were hauled to jail Friday after witnessing what cell phone video reveals was the brutal beating of a boy in a special education classroom.

Authorities say Mona Sagar, 59, and Kristie Gilmore, 38, stood idly by January 9 at Discovery Intermediate School and are now charged with child neglect for reportedly not even picking up the cell phones or radios they had handy to call for help.

Also arrested were three students--two boys and a girl--from the Poinciana classroom who are charged with aggravated assault and disrupting a school function.

Did nothing? Mona Sagar, 59 (left), and Kristie Gilmore, 38 (right) were arrested Friday and charged with child neglect for allegedly standing by and not even calling for help during a brutal beating in their Florida classroom January 9 that one child caught on cell phone video

Chaos erupts: The fight broke out in a Poinciana classroom as students watched in horror and the altercation may now cost the two teacher's aides who reportedly failed to intervene or call for help their jobs

One student took cell phone video of the terrifying beating and what the attacker says is equally as startling as the physical abuse.

'Next comment I'm gonna stomp your heart,' yells the unnamed youth. 'And I you got conditions where I stomp on it, (you're) dead!'

According to the Orlando Sentinel, the boy who suffered the beating has a medical condition.

The two other students charged in the case allegedly threw chairs during the melee as a girl recorded the incident and someone yelled from off-camera asking why the victim refused to hit back.

'I'm gonna stomp your heart!': As two teachers allegedly did nothing, a boy with a heart condition was brutally attacked by a fellow student whose words rove he knew how harmful his blows could be

'That was no mercy,' the voice said. 'It's crazy.'

What authorities apparently feel is even more crazy is how passive Gilmore and Sagar were during the ordeal.

They say the women had both cell phones and radios they could have easily used to call for help but chose not to react.

The fight reportedly began as a result of racist remarks made by one of the boys.

School district officials say the aides have been removed from the classroom and may be suspended without pay.

'You're dead': The attacker threatened the boy as he laid on the floor. According to Gilmore's roommate, she was also felt threatened because she is six months pregnant

What's more, a sheriff's office spokeswoman says neither of the aides is cooperating with investigators.

Meanwhile, a friend of mother of four Gilmore says the allegedly neglectful school employee is six months pregnant.

'I don't blame her, she's pregnant,' Gilmore's roommate Joshua Ortiz told WKMG. 'She's really understanding and caring. I don't think she means any harm.'

Ortiz says his roommate, though, has been the one harmed before.

'I've heard stories of her getting hit by her students before,' he said.

The attacker appears to kick the boy after racist remarks were reportedly made. ''That was no mercy,' a voice yells from off-camera. 'It's crazy.'
