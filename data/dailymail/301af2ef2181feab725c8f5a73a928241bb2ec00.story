We like to pride ourselves as being one of the style capitals of the world but it seems many British women are now looking to American stars for their fashion inspiration.

Blake Lively - who shot to fame in US TV show Gossip Girl - has been crowned ‘Queen of the Copycats’ with 42 per cent of UK females admitting they base their own wardrobes on what the 25-year-old beauty wears, while Rihanna and her eccentric style came second.

Despite being hailed as the world's biggest style icon, the Duchess of Cambridge's conservative look  could only manage third place, just ahead of singer Rita Ora.

Style inspiration: Rita Ora glams it up for the red carpet and has fun with fashion

Chris Perrett at iLikeOffers.co.uk, who conducted the poll, said of the results: 'It appears British women are increasingly looking across the pond for 
their style cues. Only four of the top ten celebrities identified were 
British!'

'With such opposing approaches to 
fashion, it was also surprising to see Catherine Middleton and Rihanna 
both in the top three. Kate has a very conservative style while Rihanna 
pushes boundaries with what she wears, and sometimes doesn’t wear!'

Rita Ora, Rosie Huntington-Whiteley and Made In Chelsea's Millie Mackintosh were the other British stars in the top ten and it seems more and more women are looking to celebrities to get style ideas.

Chris continued: 'This is a big trend…nearly 90 per cent of 
women questioned said they get their sartorial inspiration from the rich
 and famous. Looks like it’s sidewalk over catwalk when it comes to 
imitating style.'

American stars Sarah Jessica-Parker, Kim Kardashian, Jennifer Lawrence and Beyoncé made up the rest of the top ten.

So big is the craze for ‘Copycat 
Fashion’, that 17 per cent of women admitted to immediately seeking out an item 
worn by their idol and buying it no matter the cost.

However,
 a thriftier approach also exists with 31 per cent of participants saying they 
search for something that imitates the look but costs less.

Social media was identified as a key tool for Copycats to keep on top of the latest celebrity looks, with 73 per cent saying they follow their famous fashion crush on Twitter, 60 per cent on Instagram, 47 per cent on Facebook and 20 per cent on Pinterest.

Facebook was identified as the most popular way to stay in touch with favourite brands followed by Twitter, Instagram and then Pinterest.

Male participants in the iLikeOffers.co.uk survey were divided, 50 per cent said they take style cues from celebrity men while the other half denied it. 

Tinie Tempah came out on top as King of the Copycats.
