The driver of a U-Haul truck loaded down with beer kegs which crushed to death a 30-year-old fashion design student at a weekend football game has apologised to her family for the accident.

Yale student Brendan Ross, 21, hit Massachusetts College of Art and Design student Nancy Barry in the tailgating field at the Harvard-Yale football game in New Haven, Connecticut, on Saturday.

His lawyer William Dow said the collision was a ‘tragic accident that appears to be the result of a vehicle malfunction’ as Mr Ross drove the rented vehicle at 35mph into a crowded car park.

Tragic: Nancy Barry, a 30-year-old who studied fashion design at Massachusetts College of Art and Design, died shortly after she was struck by a runaway truck

Barry, of Salem, Massachusetts, 
suffered fatal injuries at the scene. Yale student Sarah Short, 31, of 
New Haven, and Harvard employee Elizabeth Dernbach, 23, of Naples, 
Florida, were both injured.

Ross and his family want to express 
their condolences to the three people who were hit by the truck, Mr Dow 
said. Ms Short remains in hospital with leg injuries but Ms Dernbach has
 been released.

Ross passed a field sobriety test 
after the collision on Saturday and police said he has been cooperative 
in their investigation, which remained open on Sunday. No charges had 
been filed.

Ross was driving the truck through a 
tailgating area before the game when the vehicle turned a corner and 
sped up, hitting the three women and then crashing into other U-Haul 
vans, police said.

It is not yet clear why the driver 
sped up but at least one witness told police he pressed the pedal in 
annoyance that the women were not moving fast enough, the New Haven 
Register reported.

'I watched a woman die today,' one man
 told the New Haven Register of the crash, which happened at 9:49am. 'It
 was totally an accident. Whether he was impaired is another question.'

The U-Haul was heading to a tailgate 
party for Sigma Phi Epsilon, the fraternity of which Ross is a member 
and where police listed his address, reported the Yale Daily News.

A spokesman for the fraternity in 
Richmond, Virginia, said on Sunday it was ‘deeply saddened by the tragic 
accident’ and its ‘thoughts and prayers go out to the victims and their 
families’.

People huddled around them trying to 
help, according to a video believed to have been recorded shortly after 
the accident. ‘We're not getting a pulse,' said someone crouched near 
one victim.

Tim Walker, of Pawtucket, Rhode 
Island, said he was grilling sirloin tips when he heard the crash behind
 him. He turned and saw two people lying on the ground.

'The driver looked shocked. Absolutely

dazed look like he had just hit someone.'

Yale put its mental health counselors 
and chaplain's office on alert to work with students and said its Dean's
 Office and Yale Athletics plan to carry out a full review of 
regulations on tailgating.

New Haven police said their 
investigation will include a forensic review of the rented U-Haul truck,
 witness statements and other work before they can determine whether 
anyone should face charges.

At the annual Yale-Harvard game, 
tailgating is nearly as storied as the competition itself. Elaborate 
buffets dot the car parks and fans frequently fill U-Haul trucks 
with kegs, grills and hard alcohol.

Six years ago, Yale began shutting 
down all parties after halftime to curb binge drinking and keep students
 and alumni safe. The car parks around the stadium can be full of 
drunken revellers.

Saturday's fans had gathered for the 
128th game of the Ivy League rivalry, which Harvard won 45-7 for its 
fifth straight victory over Yale. The rivalry dates back to 1875.

At halftime, with Harvard leading, the
 public address announcer at Yale Bowl informed the crowd of the 
accident and the woman's death. He asked fans to stand and observe a 
moment of silence.

‘She was an angel - and I'm not just 
saying that - an absolute angel, and we don't know why this happened to 
her,’ Barry's grandmother Nancy St. Pierre, also of Salem, told the 
Hartford Courant.
