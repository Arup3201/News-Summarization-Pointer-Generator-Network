Tower Bridge has gone red, white and blue in preparation for its starring role in the Diamond Jubilee and the London Olympics.

A new system using 3,800 LED lights was tested this week, allowing the bridge to gleam 'diamond white' for the weekend — at no cost to the taxpayer after a deal was struck between Mayor Boris Johnson, the City of London Corporation and London 2012 sponsors EDF and GE.

It will form the backdrop to Sunday’s pageant on the Thames, with the Queen reviewing 1,000 boats from the deck of the royal barge as it is berthed at HMS President, the Royal Navy’s riverside base in the capital.

Tower Bridge has gone red, white and blue in preparation for its starring role in the Diamond Jubilee and the London Olympics

In preparation for the summer of celebration which will see both the Queen's Diamond Jubilee and the Olympic games the iconic landmark was given a makeover and a spruce up worthy of being paraded in front of the eyes of the world.

The first test will be the Royal Jubilee Pageant on Sunday which will see the Queen and six senior members of the royal family travel down the Thames on the royal barge.

They will be accompanied by a flotilla of vessles of all shapes and sizes.

The pageant will conclude with a flypast of nine Navy helicopters in a diamond formation, led by a Second World War Swordfish biplane.

The helicopters — Sea Kings, Lynx and Merlins — will fly two rotor spans apart at a height of 700ft.

Flypast
 director Lt-Cdr Barney Wainwright said: 'The pilot will be 
concentrating very carefully on his formation position. The pilots were 
briefed only last week by the admiral not to be distracted.'

Tower Bridge swung open today as ships old and new took to the Thames ahead of the Queen's Diamond Jubilee river pageant this weekend.

A small flotilla of vessels representing the Royal Navy's Royal Barge Honour Guard - including specialist armed police in speedboats - passed under the raised bridge as sailors from HMS Hurworth looked on.

Meanwhile across the country, Jubilee fever has taken hold, with Woburn Safari Park celebrating with bunting, Union flags and even tea parties for its animals.

At a Darlington dog rehoming centre, a litter of puppies were given royal names to mark the occasion.

One enterprising farmer got his lambs involved by spray-painting them with the national flag.

Back in London, HMS Hurworth acted the part of the Royal Barge but it will all look quite different on Sunday.

Also on the water was the Phoenicia - a replica of a 600BC trading vessel - which sailed through on its return from Sardinia.

Skippered
 by British adventurer 
Philip Beale, it was built in 2008 in the style of an ancient trading 
ship believed to have achieved the first circumnavigation of Africa.

Mr
 Beale's ship - which has also just completed a voyage tracing the 
Phoenician-Cornish tin trade route - is due to become a floating museum 
at nearby St Katharine's Dock.

On the day, ten naval vessels will surround the Queen's Barge, while almost a thousand other boats will take part in the procession.

Security for the pageant will be extremely tight, with Scotland Yard saying it is the biggest ever security operation for the Queen.

Police frogmen will carry out underwater searches while bridges and river banks will be monitored and all the boats taking part will be searched, the Evening Standard reported.

The Met is deploying 23 boats, with two 
from neighbouring Essex, ranging from high visibility vessels to more 
discreet unmarked craft, some of which will be carrying the specialist 
firearms officers.

Dai Davies, a former head of Scotland
 Yard’s royal protection squad, said: 'This is undoubtedly the biggest 
security operation of its kind ever mounted and is an unprecedented 
challenge.

'There has been a
 huge exercise to prepare for this. Each vessel will be searched and all
 those on board have had to provide their names to be checked. 

'The country is still on a high alert for a terror attack but there is the added security threat from anarchist groups and fixated individuals. This is a huge operation, and on a scale that I never encountered.'

Police say that all leave for Sunday’s flotilla has been cancelled and 6,000 officers will be deployed along the route.

In addition, 7,000 stewards will line the banks to control the crowds. Scotland Yard said it had been planning security for the past 18 months and described the operation as bigger than last year’s royal wedding.

Security was strengthened even further after activist Trenton Oldfield dived into the river to disrupt the Boat Race in April.

Twenty RNLI lifeboats will be on duty as well as Port of London and London fire brigade vessels. In total around 190 safety boats will be afloat.

Deputy assistant commissioner Stephen Kavanagh, who is leading the security operation, said: 'This is a huge historic event for London and it is a privilege to be policing.

'We want our officers to be part of the celebrations but we are also prepared for possible protests and we have appropriate levels of security.

'We remind people that their right to protest will be balanced against the rights of those people who have come to attend this historic event. I would say that any individual who is thinking of making a protest and diving into the water should think very carefully about their own safety with the number of boats afloat.'

Police say they have intelligence of at least two groups which are threatening protests. One is the republican Jubilee Protest which says demonstrators will unfurl banners near City Hall. Organisers claim it will be the 'biggest and boldest anti-monarchy protest in modern times.'

Other anarchist groups are also thought to be plotting protests.

Skippers and crews of the 1,000 vessels, many of whom will unfamiliar with navigating the Thames, have been urged not to drink until afterwards.
