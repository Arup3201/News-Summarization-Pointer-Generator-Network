The scale of Britain’s dependence on foreign energy was laid bare yesterday in a set of official figures.

According to a report from the Department for Energy and Climate Change, the amount of coal, oil and gas imported by the UK hit a record high in 2012. At the same time domestic production dwindled, falling by more than 10 per cent last year after a slump in output from the North Sea.

Last year the UK imported 173million tons of oil equivalent – a measure of energy potential that covers all fuels including gas, coal and oil. This was 7.1 per cent more than 2011 and is the highest level ever recorded.

Last week the UK had only 36 hours of domestic gas reserves left, after plummeting temperatures saw a surge in demand

But the amount exported fell 5 per cent to 80million tons – the lowest level since 1989.

Overall some 43 per cent of the energy used in the UK came from overseas – the most since 1976, when the country was on the cusp of its own oil boom.

Energy analyst Angelos Anastasiou, from Cantor Fitzgerald, said: ‘We’re rolling towards a crisis scenario.

‘We do need new generating capacity, and the likelihood is we’ll end with more gas-fired power stations.

‘But the problem is at the moment they’re not economical to build because of the returns.’

He added: ‘That’s the way of world now, because sadly we are running out of North Sea oil and gas. The situation is unlikely to improve.’

Last week, the UK had only 36 hours of domestic gas reserves left, after plunging temperatures saw millions of homes switch on the heating.
