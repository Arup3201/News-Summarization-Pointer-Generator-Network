A former University of Wyoming student who was threatened with rape by an anonymous Facebook poster has been charged with misdemeanor for sending the threat herself.

Meghan Lanker-Simons was originally believed to be the target of the Facebook posting by a supposed Republican who called her 'that chick that runs her liberal mouth all the time,' and threatened sexual violence.

University of Wyoming police traced the IP address of the computer from which the threat was sent to a computer named 'ElComputerdeMeg' and belonging to Meghan Lanker-Simons.

Hoax: University of Wyoming student Meg Lanker-Simons (pictured on April 29 with her husband Andrew) posted a threatening message targeting her, in order to frame Republicans

Threats: Police say the woman mentioned in this post, Meg Lanker Simons, actually wrote the threatening message. Her husband, Andrew, responded angrily (below)

Court documents add that the 'user logged
 into the computer at the time was meghanm, or Meghan Michelena, also 
known as Meghan Lanker-Simons.'

Lanker-Simons has pleaded not guilty to the charge of misdemeanor for interfering with police.

The Laramie Boomerang reports that Lanker-Simons’ attorneys filed a motion to suppress evidence seized during a search warrant.

Prosecutor Joshua Merseal, of the Albany County and Prosecuting Attorney’s Office, has filed a response asking the court to deny the motion.

The
 posting that threatened Lanker-Simons occurred on a Facebook forum for 
UW students, leading to an investigation by University of Wyoming police 
because it was directed at a student.

The Facebook page, which is not officially affiliated with the university, was taken down and a student-led demonstration against sexual violence was held.

People were outraged by the Facebook posting and demanded the author of the post be found.

Lanker-Simons' own husband Andrew Simons posted on the page expressing his disgust and vowing to 'take this as far as it will go.'

Outrage: The posting sparked an outcry across the University and students even organized protests. Meg Lanker-Simons went along with the outrage until police learned she was behind the post

Ironic: Meg Lanker-Simons, pictured in 2011, wrote a strongly worded reaction to the threatening post (that she herself posted) calling it 'disgusting'

Lanker-Simons is a blogger and local radio show host who advocates for liberal causes.

In
 2010, she filed a lawsuit against the university that forced UW to 
allow 1960s radical Bill Ayers on the campus for a speech on education.

Ayers co-founded the Weather Underground, an anti-war group from the Vietnam Era that claimed to be responsible for a series of bombings, including nonfatal explosions at the Pentagon and U.S. Capitol.

The Facebook post came to light when people including Pamela Kandt, co-convener of the Episcopal Women's Caucus and a Casper activist, complained to the university and demanded action.

Besides the threat of sexual assault, the posting was written to make it appear as if its author was a conservative Republican.

Kandt came to Lanker-Simons' defense last month.

'I will tell you, I believe Meg is innocent of this outrage,' Kandt told the Laramie Boomerang, adding she believes the citation issued by police is a 'classic case of blaming the victim.'

'I mean, my God, who would do this to herself?' she added.

Lanker-Simons has pleaded not guilty and a motions hearing is scheduled for July 30.
