Thieves have broken into the monument of President James A. Garfield and stolen a set of commemorative spoons.

Vandals shattered a window to get inside the 180-foot-tall monument at Lakeview Cemetery in Cleveland Heights.

The thieves took the 13 silver spoons which have Garfield's face engraved on them, but left behind the cash donation box.

A cemetery worker discovered the theft Wednesday.

Police reports say cigarette butts, a T-shirt and a whiskey bottle were recovered.

The cemetery's website says Garfield is the only president to have his casket on full display. 

His wife Lucretia Rudolph Garfield, has a casket next to his.

James A. Garfield was the 20th President of the United States

Katherine Goss, president and chief executive of Lake View Cemetery, which houses the Garfield tomb told The Washington Post the spoons, 'would be hard to sell in a historical auction because everyone would wonder where they came from.'

She said the fact that only the silver spoons were stolen lead her to guess that 'someone had to prove that they had been inside the monument — so they had to take something.'

Garfield, the nation's 20th president, was born in the Cleveland suburb of Moreland Hills.

On July 2, 1881, Garfield was shot in a Washington railroad station by a man who had been turned down for a job with the President.

In a critical condition from the bullet, Garfield lay in the White House for weeks.

Alexander Graham Bell, inventor of the telephone, tried to find the bullet with an induction-balance electrical device which he had designed - he was unsuccessful.

Garfield was taken to the New Jersey seaside and seemed to be recuperating, but three months after he was shot, he died from an infection - he had served just 200 days in office.

His widow went home to their farm in Ohio and died on March 14, 1918.

President Garfield was born in the Cleveland suburb of Moreland Hills in 1931.

His father died when he was two and he saved up enough money for his education by driving canal boat teams.

He graduated from Williams College in
 Massachusetts in 1856, and he returned to the Western Reserve Eclectic 
Institute (later Hiram College) in Ohio as a classics professor.

He married Lucretia Rudolph Garfield in 1858 and they had seven children, although two of them died in childhood.

In 1880 he became the nation's 20th president, but it was a short-lived office. 

On July 2, 1881, in a Washington railroad station, an embittered attorney who had sought a consular post shot the President.

Mortally wounded, Garfield lay in the White House for weeks.

Garfield did not have the shortest presidential term - William Henry Harrison served for about a month before his death.
