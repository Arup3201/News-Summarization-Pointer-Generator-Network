The dreaded flu virus is taking the U.S. by storm as this year's strain continues to work its way across the country - and in its wake it already has left 20 children dead, according to new numbers released Friday by federal health officials.

That number has doubled from 10 since last week's report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on the number of reported pediatric flu deaths.

For many, the flu is little more than a cough and a fever. But health officials want the public to know that in many case it can also be deadly.

Vaccine: Health officials urge everyone to get a flu shot to avoid falling victim to the deadly virus

Outbreak: This year's flu virus has made its way across the entire country and has left 20 children dead so far

And not just for children and the elderly.

'The highest hospitalization rate is among adults aged 65 years or older,
 followed by those in age groups 0-4 years and 50-64 years,' the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 
reports in its weekly statistic on flu. 'However, those aged 18-64 years
 still account for 61 percent of reported hospitalized cases.'

According to the CDC, anywhere from 3,000 to 49,000 people die every year from flu-related illnesses, and this year is no different.

One of the most recent instances of a child dying from the flu virus is the death of Savannah Hyden.

Hyden died last week at Monroe Carell Jr. Children's Hospital near Vanderbilt University near Nashville. According to her parents, the girl had not been given a flu vaccine this year.

'She was brilliant in every aspect,' her father, Steven Hyden, told the Tennessean. 'We have really taken a big loss. ... She could have been the president.'

Victim: 8-year-old Kaitlyn Mills, of Louisiana, also died after being infected with the flu

Hayden's mother, Natasha Renee Fiser, told the paper that her daughter developed a bacterial infection after contracting the flu. The infection caused the girl to go into cardiac arrest.

'She was down for too long, there was no oxygen to her brain, and her organs just started shutting down,' Fiser said.

Fiser says she was shocked that her daughter got sick and then three days later was put on life support.

Another child to succumb to the virus was Lydia Christine Kizziar of Carrollton, Texas. She was just a seventh grader when she died earlier this month - and her little sister is in the hospital fighting off the very same illness.

Lydia's circumstance is increasingly common. Texas has been hard-hit this year as swine flu, or H1N1, pummels the Southern U.S. and threatens Americans nationwide.

Savannah Hyden, 11, also died from complications related to the flu. Her parents say she didn't get vaccinated

Another child victim of this year's flu virus is 8-year-old Kaitlyn Mills of Bossier City, Louisianan.

Mills died last week after contracting the H1N1 virus -  just one day after her parents reportedly noticed their daughter suffering from flu-like symptoms.

A  5-year-old Oregon boy, Ronan Burgess, also died from the H1N1 virus.

According to the CDC, 25 percent of those who go to the hospital and are tested for the flu test positive for influenza.

At this same point in last year's flu season, 29 children had died.

Health officials stress that there are antiviral drugs that will combat the flu, and if those infected get treated quickly they will more than likely recover.
