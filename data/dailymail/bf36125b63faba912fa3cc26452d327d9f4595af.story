When police were told a kangaroo was on the loose in rural Lancashire, they probably thought the callers had been drinking.

But as officers carried out an operation against rural drink drivers they were handed this remarkable picture of a wallaby hopping down the road.

The image, taken in the village of Winmarleigh near Garstang, Lancashire, shows the wild animal caught in a vehicle's headlights.

Wallaby in the wild: Police were handed this picture of a wallaby bounding down a country lane in the village of Winmarleigh near Garstang, Lancashire

The animal has now been nicknamed 'Skippy' by locals after the 1960s Australian TV series.

Wallabies are native to Australia but have 
been introduced in the UK in parks, zoos and farms.

It is thought the 
Lancashire wallaby had escaped from a nearby farm near the 19th century 
Winmarleigh Hall adventure centre.

It was spotted after a series of alleged sightings of the so-called 'Pilling Panther' - a wildcat on the loose on the outskirts of a nearby village.

Sighting: Police have received regular reports of the wallaby on the loose - but had dismissed them

Police Constable Dave Kerfoot of Lancashire Police later posted the picture on his force's Facebook page.

PC Kerfoot said: 'We have been receiving reports of a kangaroo being on the loose in Winmarleigh - at first, I suspected that it was just residents in Winmarleigh wanting a Winmarleigh Wallaby to rival the Pilling Panther.

'But when the photographic evidence came through we couldn't really dispute that there was a wallaby, or a kangaroo, in the road. In fact the photo would suggest I have been overly suspicious.

'As far as we know it's still out and about, it's certainly an interesting one. Whatever next I wonder.'

Kangaroos and wallabies are marsupials and are closely related, though adult kangaroos are larger than wallabies.

They can be identified via their teeth, which are different as kangaroos mainly eat grass while wallabies mostly eat leaves.

One local Jozanda Parkinson posted a message saying: 'It's been living in the woods at the hall for a few weeks now and we've seen it numerous times. So it is definitely real!'

Another local said: 'Remember back in the day when I came to the pub one night and told you I had seen a Kangaroo or Wallaby jump across the road in front of my van one night and you all told me I was crazy and took the mick for months?'

Nadia Akula wrote: 'It's Skippy. He's trying to lead you to someone that needs your help.'
