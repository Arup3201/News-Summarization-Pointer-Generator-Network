Charlton are closing on a deal to sign Tony Watt from Standard Liege. 

The 20-year-old, who shot to prominence when he scored Celtic’s winner in their 2-1 Champions League victory over Barcelona in November 2012, may join the Championship side on an initial loan with a view to a permanent deal.

Watt began his career at Airdrie United but was snapped up by Celtic after impressing during the 2010-11 season.

He spent two years at the Scottish giants with mixed success before they loaned him out to Belgian side Lierse last season.

And his eight goals in 17 appearances for the club caught the eye of Standard Liege who bought him last summer.

The 20-year-old has been capped at Under 19, 20 and 21 level for Scotland but is yet to play for the senior side. 

But now Charlton are hoping to bring the young forward back to the UK, on loan initially
