One sentiment was clear among the thousands who rallied Thursday night for action in last month's fatal shooting of an unarmed Florida teenager: justice.

Civil rights leader Al Sharpton helped lead the charge, demanding the arrest of neighborhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman in 17-year-old Trayvon Martin's killing in Sanford.

'We cannot allow a precedent when a man can just kill one of us... and then walk out with the murder weapon,' Sharpton said, flanked by Martin's parents and a stage full of supporters. 'We don't want good enough. We want George Zimmerman in court with handcuffs behind his back.'

The rally came the same day that 
bitterly criticised Police Chief Bill Lee stepped down temporarily, he 
said to help quell the rising passions surrounding the case. Hours 
later, Gov. Rick Scott announced that the county prosecutor also had 
recused himself from the case and that a state attorney from 
Jacksonville would take over the investigation.

Sharpton attended the rally just hours after the death of his mother. 'This is where she would want me to be,' he said.

He was joined by Martin's parents, 
Martin Luther King III and nationally syndicated radio host Michael 
Baisden whose encouragement to his Twitter followers helped escalate 
attention on the shooting.

Trayvon Martin lived in Miami and was 
in Sanford visiting family February 26 when he went to a convenience store. 
He was walking back carrying a bag of Skittles candy and can of iced 
tea, the hood of his jacket pulled over his head because it was raining. He was approached by the 28-year-old Zimmerman, who told a police 
dispatcher he thought Martin looked suspicious. Zimmerman shot Martin 
following a chase and fight.

Zimmerman says he shot Martin in 
self-defense, and Sanford police officials say there is no evidence that
contradicts that. Some neighbors in the gated community have praised 
Zimmerman for taking a stand against crime in the neighborhood of the 
city that is 57 percent white and 30 percent black. Police say Zimmerman
is white; his family says he's Hispanic.

Martin's parents, Tracy Martin and 
Sybrina Fulton, believe Zimmerman should have been arrested. They claim 
he was profiling their son and acted like a vigilante.

The rally was initially planned for a 
400-seat church. But it was moved to downtown to make room for all the 
people who stood shoulder-to-shoulder in Fort Mellon Park, many holding 
signs with everything from 'Justice For Trayvon' to 'Chief is gone, 
Zimmerman is next.'

Fulton was teary-eyed when she 
addressed the crowd, telling them 'we want justice for Trayvon' before 
referencing a popular Bible verse when she said she had been reminded to
'trust in the Lord with all thy heart and lean not on thy own 
understanding' during the past month.

The actions of the Sanford Police Department following the shooting of Trayvon Martin on February 26.

Immediately after they responded to the scene, they took George Zimmerman back to police headquarters but while there, they did not test him for alcohol or drugs. Considering he is heard slurring his words on the 911 call, that was a particularly agregious move.

Not only that, but playing into to thoughts of Mr Zimmerman, the police instead tested Trayvon's dead body for alcohol and drugs. He was clean.

They allowed Mr Zimmerman to leave the police station without pressing any charges.

And until the very recent press buzz about the case, they proceeded to do no further investigation after that fateful night.

It has taken almost a month for anything to change in the case, which has upset Trayvon's family and their supporters.

Tracy Martin thanked the rally goers.

'If Trayvon were here, he would have been here tonight,' he said. 'He was a people person. Let's get justice for your son.'

Familiar chants like 'No justice, no 
peace' were also sung throughout the night. At least four charter buses 
from Atlanta brought rally goers.

Martin's parents both spoke to the 
crowd just hours after they sat down with Scott who announced that the 
local state attorney, Norman Wolfinger, had recused himself from the 
case. In a letter to Scott, Wolfinger said that while he thought he 
could fairly oversee any prosecution that develops in the case, his 
recusal was aimed at 'toning down the rhetoric and preserving the 
integrity of the investigation.'

Scott appointed Angela B. Corey, the state attorney for the Jacksonville area, to take over the case.

That announcement by the attorney for Martin's parents brought a loud cheer.

'We've still gotta hold everybody accountable until there's an arrest,' attorney Benjamin Crump beckoned the crowd.

Sharpton took up an impromptu monetary
collection for Martin's parents. He started it off with a $2,500 pledge
and he was joined by Greg Mathis and Baisden who both pledged $10,000 
each. Former New York Gov. David Paterson also gave $2,000. Paterson was
among several state and national politicians at the rally.

Unexpected: Tracy Martin, pictured, said he and his son's mother found out about the march after arriving in New York City, where they have done interviews about the case

Buckets were also passed throughout 
the crowd with Sharpton telling them 'Y'all show the world we're gonna 
finance our own movement.'

There was a brief moment of booing, when Sanford Mayor Jeff Triplett addressed the crowd.

But U.S. Representative Corrine Brown 
quickly quieted it when she told them how Triplett flew to Washington, 
DC, and met with congressmen for five hours about the case and helped 
get the 911 tapes released to the public, which generated a social media
buzz that propelled the case nationally.

'Now we are working on this issue,' she said. 'And everybody didn't want him working on this issue.'

Brown also announced that they hope to
have hearings in Washington with the Justice Department about the case 
as early as Tuesday. The FBI is looking into what happened.

Dick Gregory, a comedian who uses 
humor to convey his civil rights message, said the steady pressure 
should be the goal going forward.

'All you have to do is be a turtle,' he said. 'Hard on the outside, soft on the inside and willing to stick your neck out.'

Florida is among 21 states with a ‘Stand Your Ground Law,’ which gives people wide latitude to use deadly force rather than retreat during a fight.

The self-defense law helps explain why a neighborhood watch captain George Zimmerman has not been arrested in the shooting death of an unarmed teenager.

The Florida law lets police officers on the scene decide whether they believe the self-defense claim. In many cases, the officer's defer to making the arrest, letting the courts work out whether the deadly force is justified. In this case, however, police have said they are confident they did the right thing by not charging 28-year-old Zimmerman, a white Hispanic.

Martin's family questions Zimmerman's story, and believes if their races were reversed, there is no doubt a black shooter would be jailed, even if he claimed self-defense.

‘They are making it look like Zimmerman is the victim and their son is in the grave,’ said Benjamin Crump, attorney for Martin's parents. ‘It's about equal justice.’

In a statement released Wednesday, Sanford Police Chief Bill Lee insisted his officers were ‘prohibited from making an arrest based on the facts and circumstances they had at the time,’ including physical evidence that supported Zimmerman's self-defense claim.

‘The Sanford Police Department has conducted a complete and fair investigation of this incident,’ Lee said, adding that it's now up to prosecutors to determine whether to bring charges.

Late Wednesday, commissioners in Sanford, a city of 53,000 people outside Orlando that is 57 per cent white and 30 per cent black, voted 3-2 to express ‘no confidence’ in the police chief.
