Police believe there is enough evidence to charge John Terry over an alleged racist remark, it was claimed today.

Officers have quizzed a string of players about the Chelsea captain’s clash on the pitch with Anton Ferdinand last month.

England captain Terry, 30, came under fire after he allegedly called the QPR defender a ‘f****** black c***’ during a heated match.

'Racist' slur? John Terry covers his mouth as he's surrounded by QPR players during the heated game at Loftus Road, West London, last month

Police have now compiled evidence from players and video recordings of the game - which show Terry’s lip movements - and are in the process of sending the file to the Crown Prosecution Service, it is claimed.

The CPS will then decide if the evidence is strong enough to secure a conviction in court. They will also have to decide if proceeding with the case is in the public interest.

‘There is a feeling among some officers that John Terry has a case to answer,’ a source told the Daily Mirror.

Terry categorically denies making the racist slur during Chelsea’s 1-0 Barclays Premier League defeat at Loftus Road on October 23 and is fighting to clear his name.

Speaking after the incident, he said: 'I’ll do whatever it takes to clear my name. I don’t have anything to hide.'

Police are understood to have interviewed Terry’s teammate Ashley Cole about the incident. The black defender was on the pitch at the time.

He is said to have gone into the QPR dressing room after the dispute to act as a peacemaker between Ferdinand and Terry.

Terry could be jailed for up to seven years and lose his position at the head of the national team if he is found guilty.

Fifa President Sepp Blatter believes players should settle matters with a handshake after the game. David Cameron, right, criticised the stance

A Met spokesman said today: 'Most investigations hypothetically do give their evidence to the CPS after this length of time. The CPS then make a decision. That would be normal process.'

A CPS spokesman said: 'CPS have not received a file and the police investigation is ongoing.'

The ongoing case comes as Fifa boss Sepp Blater faced calls to step down after claiming that racism does not exist on the football pitch.

Blatter said that players should settle the matter with a handshake at the end of the game.

David Cameron yesterday joined the chorus of voices criticising Blatter over his comments.

The Prime Minister said: ‘It’s appalling to suggest that racism in any way should be accepted as part of the game.

‘A lot of work has gone into ridding racism from all aspects of our society, including football. As many of our top sports stars have rightly pointed out, now is not the time for complacency.’

In an interview with Fox Soccer, Blatter stuck to his guns and pointed out that FIFA had taken the World Cup to South Africa.

He added: ‘But if you also be a little bit in a sporting spirit when there is something happening on the field of play, during a match between two players - I call it foul language. I’m not saying about discrimination, but it’s foul language, it’s a foul play.

‘At the end of the match, if you have foul play (when) the match is over you shake hands... and therefore also forget what has been on the field of play.’

The furore has been heightened by another case of alleged racism on the pitch which has seen Liverpool’s Luis Suarez charged by the FA with racially abusing Patrice Evra.
