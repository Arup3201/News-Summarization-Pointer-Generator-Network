Four years before Chef Dominique Ansel's much-hyped Cronut hit the market, the lesser-known 'Bruffin' was born.

Essentially a muffin crafted from a sweet brioche-type batter - but with fillings available in sweet and savory flavors - its co-creator Michael Bagley likens it to 'a light flaky croissant'.

Until now, the $6 Bruffin has only been available in New York City at its namesake location, The Bruffin Cafe, but such is the demand that come January 19, the pastries will be shipping (frozen) worldwide.

According to its website, the Bruffin - which each contain between 300 and 450 calories - is the 'perfect meal in a muffin for any time of the day' and is available in 16 savory and sweet flavors.

All of its assorted varieties are inspired by different countries of the world.

Options include the bacon and sharp cheddar British Bruffin, the buffalo chicken, blue cheese and hot sauce American Bruffin, and the Chorizo, Manchego and Ancho Chile Spanish Bruffin.

Not a Cronut rip-off! Mr Bagley, who created the hybrid with chef Mady Youcef, says he was actually 'discouraged' by the Cronut craze (pictured) 

It may seem logical to draw comparisons between the Bruffin and the Cronut, which developed worldwide fame and a cult following when it launched in 2013, but don't mistake the Bruffin for a rip-off.

Speaking to ABC News, Mr Bagley, who created the hybrid with Chef Mady Youcef, says he was actually 'discouraged' by the Cronut craze.

'We did this before the Cronut came to play,' he said.

'But ultimately I think existence of these things, the ingenuity and creativity, is a good thing and consumers are enjoying trying new creations.'
