Roberto Martinez has assured Everton fans that Romelu Lukaku will be signing for the Merseyside club this summer.

Belgium centre forward Lukaku returns to Chelsea training on Wednesday amid talk of another move away from Stamford Bridge.

And Toffees boss Martinez has fueled the fire by telling fans asking if Everton could sign the 21-year-old: 'of course we'll get him.'

The Spanish manager and his squad are on tour in Thailand as part of their pre season preparations, with Martinez making the remark after a training session in front of watching fans.

And Everton's Head of Recruitment Ian Atkins has further fueled rumours of a move back to Goodison for Lukaku, saying that he believes the striker wants a Merseyside return.

'Romelu had a terrific season for Everton last year and I know everyone at the football club wants to see him back,' Atkins told talkSPORT.

'Hopefully things can be sorted out, I think he’s quite settled in his mind that he wants to come to Everton, and hopefully he’ll be pulling on our blue shirt again next term.

'Our loan signings all did brilliant for us last season. Gareth Barry has signed permanently now which is fantastic, and hopefully Lukaku will as well.'

The 21-year-old, who spent time on loan at West Bromwich Albion in the 2012/13 campaign, has also been linked with Bundesliga big spenders Wolfsburg and, in the Spanish press, with Real Madrid.

But Wolfsburg general manager Klaus Allofs denied that his club had made an offer on Saturday.

Jose Mourinho's decision to re-sign Didier Drogba leaves Lukaku as one of four senior strikers at Chelsea alongside Diego Costa and Fernando Torres, and with Chelsea favouring a formation featuring just one striker it looks likely that one of Lukaku or Torres will leave.
