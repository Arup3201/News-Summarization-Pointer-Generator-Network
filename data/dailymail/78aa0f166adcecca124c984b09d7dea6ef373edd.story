There are times when keeping quiet might be in your best interests, but one woman from Florida was determined to make herself heard.

During a court appearance in Miami to set her bond, Pauline Miranda, 26, chose not to remain silent instead asking the judge 'Are we done here, sir?'

Miranda was in court to face charges connected to a traffic stop ion with a traffic stop in Pembroke Pines on Sunday.

Speaking at her hearing: Pauline Miranda chose not to remain silent during a first-appearance court hearing Monday

Police initially tried to stop Miranda after observing her Honda Accord traveling 65 mph in a 35 mph zone, according to an arrest report.

She appeared fidgety and restless as Miranda asked Broward Judge John 'Jay' Hurley during a bond court hearing if she was free to leave.

'I'm actually innocent, sir,' Miranda said during one of her outbursts. 'I'm just trying to get my life back and this is not working,' she continued.

Officials repeatedly reminded Miranda that Monday's session was not a trial but only a hearing to set bond in her case.

The Orlando Sentinel reports that Miranda committed numerous infractions to avoid being stopped by cops as they tried to pull her over on Sunday.

The car she was driving was later found to be stolen.

Miranda attempted to flee by going in the wrong direction, striking a police car and nearly hitting an officer, the report states.

Ultimately, police had to smash the window of her car and use a taser in order to finally bring her into custody.

The report states how Miranda had 'glassy, bloodshot eyes and slurred speech.'

Cocaine was also found inside her car.

Judge Hurley set her bond at $33,400, citing concern based on the allegations and Miranda's behavior in court.

'The court notes not only your erratic behavior allegedly at the time of arrest, but you're still displaying quite erratic behavior,' he said.
