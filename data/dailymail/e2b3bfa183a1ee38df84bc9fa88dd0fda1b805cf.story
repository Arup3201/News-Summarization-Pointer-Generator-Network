The boyfriend of the Utah mom accused of killing her six newborn babies has spoken for first time of his devastation at the allegations against her.

Shocked Jimmy Brady told MailOnline he had no idea about Megan Huntsman's past and has been left reeling that the woman he loved may have killed so many babies.

'I swear I had no idea, no idea what she had done in her past,' he said.

'If I had known anything about her dark past I would never have started dating her. It just does not add up. I know what has been said, but I still can't believe what they are saying about her.'

This The West Valley City home was the last known residence of megan Huntsman

Brady, who lived with the 39-year-old at a trailer home in the West Valley City area of Salt Lake City, said he has not been able to sleep since Huntsman was arrested on suspicion of murder.

Looking tired and drawn, he trembled as he spoke nervously drawing on a cigarette.

Work colleagues said he has been left a shattered as the realization that he was living with a woman who has allegedly killed six of her newborn babies sunk in.

'Jimmy is an innocent in this.He just can't believe that the woman he loved has been accused of doing this. It is just horrendous,' said a colleague at the supermarket where he works.

Brady, 37, has lived with Huntsman for over 18 months.

They met at Smith's Grocery store in Pleasant Grove, the town where Huntsman lived with her three daughters.

Her relationship with Brady, a father of one, resulted in her being thrown out of her marital home by her in laws.

Stephen and Diane West had said she could continue to live in the three bedroom home after their son Darren was jailed on drugs charges provided she remained faithful.

In 2011 after they learned of her affair with Brady she was told to leave - moving out and leaving behind her three daughters.

Brady said his partner fell pregnant last year, but suffered a miscarriage.

He said the child was not planned and Huntsman had told him she was too old to have another child.

'It wasn't planned. It just happened,' he said.

Brady, who shook with emotion as he spoke with MailOnline, insisted Huntsman had never talked about her past.

'It was never spoken about. We did not talk about her past life and I had no reason to really ask,' he said.

'I'm just a bystander in all of this. It has really shaken me up. What they are saying is not the Megan I knew.'

Brady said he would look after his four-year-old son from a previous relationship on a regular basis.

Neighbors said Megan and Jimmy would go out as a family.

'They looked like any other family,' said neighbor Josh Flower.

'Jimmy loved to have his kid over and they would go out to the park. Just like any other family.'

Meanwhile police have confirmed that at least one of the seven corpses found at the house in Pleasant Grove was a female.

The husband of the alleged baby killer has undergone a DNA test to see if he is the father of the victims.

Darren West voluntarily gave police a sample of his DNA to allow a forensic scientist to confirmÂ  if he is the father.

His
 wife, who is being held on $6million bond, is said to have told police all seven 
babies were conceived while she was still married to the 41-year-old 
construction worker.

MailOnline
 has revealed that she was thrown out of her home by in-laws after she 
began an affair with a co-worker when Darren was jailed for nine years 
on drugs offenses.

Darren has denied any knowledge of his wife's claim that she strangled or suffocated six of the babies soon after birth.

Huntsman, who has three daughters aged from 13 to 21, said the seventh was stillborn.

Pleasant Grove Police chief Michael Smith told MailOnline West had voluntarily submitted to a DNA test.

Josh Flowers a current neighbor of Megan Huntsman, who was arrested on Sunday of suspicion of killing six of her newborn babies over the past ten years, recalls his interactions with her outside his home on Tuesday, April 15, 2014

He refused to speculate on the sex of the seven victims and said test results should be back in the next couple of days.

He
 said: 'Mr West has been fully cooperative. He has had a DNA test which
 will help in determining the paternity of the seven babies. We are just
 waiting on the results from the medical examiner.'

Huntsman, who is on suicide watch at the Utah State jail, has claimed she gave birth to seven children between 1996 and 2006.

Police
 chief Smith said they had all but ruled out that the babies, who found 
wrapped in blankets and in boxes in Hunstsman's home were anyone's but 
hers.

'The DNA test will tell us everything,' he said.

Smith said detectives had interviewed Huntsman's three daughters who have said they had no knowledge of the pregnancies.

'There is nothing to suggest they were involved,' said Smith.

Huntsman was arrested on Saturday at the home she shared with her boyfriend Jimmy Brady.

Neighbors at the mobile home where they had lived for the past 18 months said Huntsman had a miscarriage last year.

Josh Flower, who lives next door to Huntsman, said she always seemed to adore children.

'She
 would always offer her services to babysit. She really did like being 
around children and had such a good way with them,' said Flowers.

'That
 is what makes this so hard to understand. How can someone who says she 
loves looking after children be the same person who then apparently 
suffocates seven of her own babies. It just does not make any sense.'

Flowers, 34, said more than 20 police officers and forensic teams had descended on Huntsman's home at the weekend.

He
 said Brady was attending his mother's funeral and returned home to find
 their home in the West Valley City area of Salt Lake City surrounded by
 police.

'It was just 
unreal. They said they were here to look for more evidence, I guess to 
see if any babies were buried here,' said Flowers.

'They were here a few hours and then left without finding anything.'
