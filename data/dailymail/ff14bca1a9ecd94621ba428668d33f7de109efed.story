Women are hiring private midwives to help them give birth on overstretched NHS maternity units.

They are paying up to £5,000 for their own, dedicated midwife to ensure they get the best care during labour who can also offer advice throughout the pregnancy.

One company, UK Birth Centres, claims that 200 women have paid for its top-up care in 18 NHS hospitals.

It points out that while the women are in hospital the private midwives take on advisory roles while the NHS medical staff carry out the hands-on care.

Breaking point: The Royal College of Midwives has warned that NHS staffing levels are unable to keep pace with rising birth rates

According to the website, they ensure women are supported ‘by someone known and trusted’ who ensures their ‘needs and wishes are respected.’

Recently senior midwives have warned that maternity units are at breaking point with staffing levels unable to keep pace with the rising birth rates.

Mothers say they were left on their own for hours on end during the labour as the midwives were just too busy to offer care and support.

Charlotte Ellis, 26, from Lichfield, Staffordshire, paid to have a private midwife from UK Birth Centres after what she described as a ‘horrific’ experience giving birth to her first child, now 10, in an NHS hospital.

Strain: The British birth rate has increased by 19 per cent but the number of midwives has only gone up 12 per cent

She said the midwife never left the room while she was giving birth to her son Harrison two weeks ago at Good Hope Hospital in Sutton Coldfield.

She said: ‘I wanted, this time, for it to be my choice and what I wanted. Not to be left for hours on end.

‘My [private] midwife never left the room. If she noticed something was going a bit wrong, she would say to the [NHS] midwife ‘Charlotte is getting distressed, I think you need to do this, this and this.’

Cathy Warwick, general secretary of the Royal College of Midwives has recently warned that maternity units are ‘teetering on the brink.’

She has said that maternity staff have told her that ‘the service they are giving to women and babies is deteriorating, and that safety is too often being compromised’.

The College has also calculated that the birthrate has increased by 19 per cent but the number of midwives has only gone up by 12 per cent.

It has also pointed out that many mothers are either older or obese meaning that there has been an increase in high-risk, complicated births.

Jon Skewes, a director at the Royal College of Midwives said: ‘We are campaigning for 5,000 more midwives in the NHS to ensure quality and safety in the face of the increasing birth rate.’
