Charlie Austin is likely to find himself marked by Chelsea skipper John Terry in Saturday's west London derby... just a few years after the striker had his photo taken with the defender as a young autograph hunter.

Austin, 25, scored twice on Monday night in the 2-0 win over Aston Villa at Loftus Road but is sure to face a much harder test at Stamford Bridge against Jose Mourinho’s unbeaten side.

The striker’s mother, Karen, posted a picture on Twitter of her son as a young boy with the former England captain at Chelsea’s old Harlington training ground – which is ironically now QPR’s base.

Austin started out his career in non-League football while also working as a bricklayer, playing for Kintbury Rangers, Hungerford Town and Poole Town before getting his chance in professional football with Swindon in 2009.

QPR moved to sign Austin from Burnley last summer and he repaid them with 20 goals as Harry Redknapp’s side won promotion to the Premier League via the play-offs.

On his rapid rise to the Premier League, Austin said earlier this year: 'It is hard not to look back five years, when I was training for Poole on a Tuesday and Thursday, and not pinch myself but my family keep my feet on the ground and remind me of what it was like beforehand.'

Austin already has four goals this term and would no doubt love to get on the scoresheet against one of his boyhood heroes.

Despite being massive underdogs for the game, QPR did manage to cause a shock the last time they visited Stamford Bridge with a 1-0 win thanks to a Shaun Wright-Phillips goal.
