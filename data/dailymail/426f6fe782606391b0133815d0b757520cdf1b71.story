Will England qualify from tough Group D in Brazil?

After upsetting the Mayor of Manaus earlier in the week, Roy Hodgson’s World Cup fears have been realised. England have had a mare.

Jungle fever has already set in as Hodgson prepares to head up to this tropical city buried deep in northern Brazil’s rainforests for their opening group game.

Hodgson as good as caused a diplomatic incident earlier in the week when he called Manaus ‘the place ideally to avoid’. The city’s Mayor Arthur Virgilio Neto subsequently released a statement accusing Hodgson of lacking ‘education and culture’.

Manaus has a population of 1.7m and 
England will discover that most of them will now be supporting Italy 
when the teams emerge from the tunnel on June 15.

The
boos that will ring out when they step out of the Arena Amazonia will 
confirm it. Hodgson has made a big tactical  mistake with the people of 
Manaus.

He tried in vain to clear up this dog’s dinner after the draw forced England north, but the damage has been done.

From there they will head down to Sao Paulo, via their base in Rio de Janeiro for a few days, to play Uruguay on June 19.

It
sounds awful to say this but, by the time England arrive in Belo 
Horizonte for the final group game against the group outsiders, Costa 
Rica, five days later, it is possible they will be destined for an early
flight out of Brazil.

They 
have been pitched in with a group of bad boys: Italy’s Mario Balotelli 
and Uruguay’s Luis Suarez will be up against Phil Jagielka and Gary 
Cahill before too long. It doesn’t seem fair. Suarez, with 39 goals in 
76 appearances for his country, scored four in the week for Liverpool 
against Norwich. The boy loves a goal.

But
this is it for Hodgson, time to start earning his corn as  England’s 
manager and getting past the mother of all World Cup groups. Hodgson 
spoke earlier in the week of his fears about the rainforests and the 
steaming heat will not suit England’s game.

The
humidity of Manaus is not an excuse for England to wilt like wall 
flowers against European opposition when we get  underway here in 
Brazil.

Chances to play in a
World Cup in the motherland come around every 50-odd years and they 
have ample time to prepare for the steam and sweat up in the north. The 
kick-off time has been scheduled for 9pm (2am in UK), when conditions 
will be cooler.

It will not be easy, but nobody ever won a World Cup by fluking their way towards a final.

‘To
be frank there weren’t many scenarios where I would have been jumping 
for joy,’ added Hodgson. ‘There is a lot of  travelling to be done in 
most of the groups. But our great advantage is being based in Rio means 
we have only one long trip.’

The key moment: England were drawn in Group D. They will face Costa Rica in their final match (below)

Gareth Bale: 'Tough looking group for England but some exciting games to look forward to... Portugal-Germany and Spain-Holland in particular.'

Vincent Kompany: 'Belgium, Algeria, Korea Republic, Russia. Interesting but tricky because there is no hiding for us, next round is a must. #Belgium'

Jack Wilshere: 'Tough group...but so what? If we want to win it we will have to play the best teams anyway!!'

Kevin-Prince Boateng: Brother it's time again...that's how beautiful life is!! Can't wait...love u bro!!! @JB17Official

Brad Guzan: 'All games are tough at the World Cup, chance is there to progress! Now we know, let the headlines start! #USMNT'

Nigel de Jong: 'Exciting group, looking forward to our first game  #Brazil2014 #Holland  #GroupB'

Asmir Begovic: Buzzing about our draw! Opening game at the Maracana! Looking forward to it big time. Let's do it!

Olivier Giroud: 'Switzerland Ecuador and Honduras for us!!!'

Joey Barton: 'Tough group for England. Cannot see them getting out of that.' 

Italy, who knocked England out of Euro 2012 on penalties, will find the conditions in Manaus just as tough.

Cesare
Prandelli’s team are old hands at tournament football, wily competitors
with the know-how to get through tight spots. Plucking balls from the 
pots yesterday was their 2006 World Cup-winning captain Fabio Cannavaro.
How they would love to call on him.

Instead England have another meeting with Gianluigi Buffon, Andrea Pirlo, Thiago Motta and that beast Balotelli.

That’s a massive game for England and the clash against  Uruguay will be another showstopper.

They
will head to a city where the traffic never moves and it is here that 
England’s World Cup campaign could come to a standstill. Somehow, 
Uruguay threatened to make a mess of qualification until they ran into 
Jordan in the play-offs and thumped them 5-0 on aggregate.

Hodgson’s side will have to contain two players that he elevated into the category of ‘world class’ following the draw here.

He knows all about Suarez, of course, and there is the added threat of Paris Saint-Germain forward Edinson Cavani.

Beyond that it’s Costa Rica, where former Derby and  Manchester City striker Paulo Wanchope is the assistant coach.

Hodgson
will know precious  little about them at this moment in time, other 
than they lost 1-0 against Australia in Sydney last month.

It’s a tough group for England, but that’s the law of the jungle.

Everton boss Roberto Martinez, speaking to BBC Two, said England have a great chance of winning the World Cup.

He
said: They have a really good chance. The development of the English 
footballer is better. they are tactically aware and have become 
thinkers.

'On their day they can beat anyone. England are ready now to earn that belief in a big tournament.'

Cesare Prandelli Italian coach: ‘Our group is the most difficult. It is the group of three world champions and we need to do the maximum to qualify but I don’t worry. The most important thing is arrive ready in Brazil.

'I'm worried when the Italian press says "it’s easy". The weather is the only problem, not the opponent teams. The hardest match? Against Costa Rica because we don't now this team.’

England v Italy, June 14 (11pm) - Manaus

As the name of the stadium suggests, Manaus is located bang in the middle of the Amazon rainforest. Manaus is hardly a hotbed of football, but organisers felt it was important to take the World Cup to all four corners of the country despite fears the stadium will become a white elephant once the tournament ends. Humidity can reach 99 per cent during June and July.

Uruguay v England, June 19 (8pm) - Sao Paulo

Serious doubts have emerged about the stadium which is due to host the opening match of the tournament after a crane collapsed on the site last week, killing two workers. Sao Paulo is the spiritual birthplace of football in Brazil, but its unpredictable weather may turn off visitors. The south-eastern city is known as the Terra da Garoa (Land of the Drizzle) because of the almost incessant rain that falls there. A bit like Brazil’s version of Manchester.

Costa Rica v England, June 24 (5pm) - Belo Horizonte

Venue for one of the semi-finals, Belo Horizonte’s biggest stadium has undergone a complete overhaul since Brazil won the right to host the World Cup. Ronaldo used to grace the surface of the Mineirao when he started his career with Cruzeiro. Located just an hour’s flight from Rio, Belo Horizonte is a more affordable option for travelling fans. Temperatures will be in the mid-20s, and there will be little humidity.
