A group of Russian MPs have called for former leader Mikhail Gorbachev to be prosecuted fro the breakup of the Soviet Union 23 years ago

Russian MPs are making an extraordinary bid to have Mikhail Gorbachev prosecuted for the 'illegal' collapse of the Soviet Union more than two decades ago.

They are calling for a criminal probe into the last leader of the USSR, a man widely respected around the world for ending the Cold War.

One MP in Vladimir Putin's United Russia Party even branded 83-year-old Gorbachev a 'US spy' for the break-up of the Communist state 23 years ago.

He also argued that the legal move would offer succour to pro-Moscow groups in other states seeking to revert to Kremlin rule.

Gorbachev today called the MPs' move 'sheer stupidity', adding: 'These people just do not have shame.

'I do not react to such statements. I am doing my business and taking care of my health.'

The legal demand from a multi-party group in the Russian parliament comes after Moscow has annexed its former territory of Crimea including naval port Sevastopol, and amid fears that its massing troops could lead to a new land grab in ex-Soviet neighbour Ukraine.

The group has petitioned Russian prosecutor general Yury Chaika with a view to criminal cases against those responsible for allowing the Baltic States of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia to secure independence and the later break-up of the remaining republics of the USSR.

'The MPs are hoping for opening criminal cases in future based on results of this prosecutor's investigation, one of such cases would be against the last Soviet leader, Mikhail Gorbachev,' reported Russian daily paper Izvestia.

MP Evgeniy Fedorov, of United Russia who claims Gorbachev is currently in Germany, said: 'We need a full and reliable legal analysis of the event in 1991. We must consider the fact of deliberate liquidation of power institutions.'

Gorbachev (pictured on a visit to Downing Street in 1991) is widely credited with ending the Cold War. His resignation on Christmas Day 1991 symbolised the decision to break up the Soviet Union

'I do not think Germany will extradite him if the investigation proves his guilt in the collapse of the country and his status of a US spy, according to which he was forming all his policy in those days.'

The legal probe was needed to 'draw the right historic and political picture which would let us make straight conclusions. And after all, it would encourage national liberation movements in former Soviet territories.'

Liberal Democrat MP Mikhail Dyagterev said: 'So far there has been no legal opinion on the fact of tearing states to pieces. But everything supports the idea that it was a pre-planned action, and those guilty must be made responsible, including Gorbachev.

'We are still experiencing the consequences of the event in 1991. People in Kiev are dying and will keep dying because those in the Kremlin many years ago have decided to break down the country.'

The MPs, including Communists, complained that the decision to end the Soviet Union - symbolised by Gorbachev's resignation on Christmas Day 1991 - was taken despite a referendum which opposed a break-up.

Current Russian President Vladimir Putin (pictured talking to Gorbachev in 2004) has called the breakup of the Union the 'greatest geopolitical tragedy of the 20th century'

The latest move appears to be inspired by Putin's view that 'the collapse of the Soviet Union was a major geopolitical disaster of the century. As for the Russian nation, it became a genuine drama.

'Tens of millions of our co-citizens and co-patriots found themselves outside Russian territory. Moreover, the epidemic of disintegration infected Russia itself.'

NATO General Secretary Anders Fogh Rasmussen has today told Russia to withdraw its troops from the Ukrainian border

Marina Bobkova, the head of Historic Knowledge Centre of the History Institute of Russian Academy of Science, said the matter needed a judicial decision.

'Putin was the first to give the right evaluation of this event. He called it the largest geopolitical catastrophe.

'All of us can have different opinions but we cannot argue with this statement. It was an unprecedented case - the state liquidated itself.

'It is good that this matter is raised again. And lawyers should deal with it, not politicians or historians.

She stated: 'Many participants of those days events are peacefully living at the territory of Russia and in other countries now.

'If their guilt is proved by evidence, I think it is fair to initiate sanctions against them.'

Gorbachev claimed the MPs wanted 'to PR themselves', arguing: 'The appeal is not well thought through, and from the view of historic facts - it is absolute groundless.'

Protesters in eastern Ukraine have this week called on Putin to intervene to guarantee their rights, despite warnings from NATO of further sanctions if they intervene.

NATO General Secretary Anders Fogh Rasmussen said today that any further military action by Russia would lead to grave consequences and severe economic sanctions.

He said: 'From Prague, I have this message to Russia: You have a choice to stop blaming others for your own actions, to stop massing your troops, to stop escalating this crisis and start engaging in a genuine dialogue.

'If Russia is serious about a dialogue, the first step should be to pull back its troops.'

Russia has roughly 40,000 troops stationed along the Ukrainian border and has threatened to act to protect its citizens inside the country. today pro-Russian activists have been demonstrating in the eastern city of Luhansk

Ukrainian leaders claim the trouble in its Russian-speaking regions has been fomented by Moscow's secret services.

Russia, the United States, Ukraine and the European Union will hold talks next Thursday in Geneva to try to negotiate an end to the crisis in Ukraine, EU diplomats said on Thursday.

Rasmussen said earlier this week NATO was reviewing a 1997 co-operation agreement with Russia and subsequent Rome declaration of 2002 that prevented NATO setting up bases in eastern and central Europe
