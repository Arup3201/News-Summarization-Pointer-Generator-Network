Danika France, 18, broke into a bedroom while friend Leah Trevena, 19, was in there with a man following a night out and filmed her

A teenager posted a revenge porn film on Facebook of her best friend having sex, a court was told yesterday.

Danika France filmed Leah Trevena without her consent while she was in bed with a man following a night out.

When Miss Trevena protested, 18-year-old France promised she would delete the video. 

But a month later the pair fell out and France posted the 15-second film on her own Facebook page.

Miss Trevena, a 19-year-old college student, reported her to police, saying she felt ‘hurt, humiliated and suicidal’.

‘I felt my stomach drop and I felt sick,’ she told officers. 

‘Since that day I have felt awful and have not stopped crying.’

The incident happened in October after the pair had been out together in Newcastle.

They met two men and later went back to their digs where France took the sex footage with her mobile phone.

Debbie Byrne, prosecuting, said: ‘The defendant opened the bedroom door and filmed her friend in bed with a man.

‘The video shows that she was laughing as Leah was protesting. 

'Leah didn’t give permission to be filmed and asked the defendant to immediately delete the video.’

France failed to do so and soon their friendship fell apart to the extent that she told Miss Trevena to ‘jump off a bridge and do everyone a favour’.

Later she sent the video to a friend, Charles Hall, asking him to put a screen shot online.

The 21-year-old did so on November 14, with the comment: ‘I’ve got the video if anyone else wants it.’

Three days later, France posted the video in full on Facebook.

Defence lawyer John Gallagher, said: ‘This has all the hallmarks of why I hate social media. For someone of Miss France’s age it is what they are brought up with. 

'They don’t think about the consequences of some of their actions.’ 

The incident occurred last October after the pair had been out together in Newcastle-upon-Tyne. But just one month later the pair fell out and a friend posted a screenshot of the illicit film to Miss Trevena's Facebook page. France herself then posted the video in full onto her own Facebook page

Leah Trevena from Macclesfield, Cheshire, said she was upset at the lenient sentence her former friend has been given

France, of Macclesfield, Cheshire, admitted an offence under the Malicious Communications Act. 

Magistrates in the town yesterday imposed a 12-month community order with an order to wear an electronic tag. She must pay Miss Trevena £100 in compensation.

France, who is on benefits after losing her job as a carer, also admitted a separate offence of assaulting a girl during a night out. 

For this she was given a 7pm to 7am curfew and told to pay a further £210 in costs.

Magistrates said it was a 'very serious matter' but said France (pictured outside court) pleaded guilty at the first opportunity

The court heard Miss Trevena began to distance herself from France over the incident and the pair fell out over a rumour circulating amongst their friendship group

France (right) who is currently on benefits also admitted an unrelated offence of an assault by beating on another girl during a night out in Macclesfield

Magistrates in Macclesfield heard how France told Miss Trevena (both pictured) to 'jump off a bridge and do everyone a favour

Hall, of Bollington, Cheshire, had pleaded guilty at an earlier hearing to posting the screen shot. 

He was given a three-month curfew with £145 in costs.

A spokesman from the Crown Prosecution Service said: ‘No one should have to suffer the hurt and humiliation of revenge pornography.

‘Prosecutors are being asked specifically to consider the impact on the victims involved.’

A specific offence relating to the crime is being discussed by Parliament.

Following the case Miss Trevena said: ‘I’m pretty disappointed at the sentence. She has already posted messages on social media saying she is celebrating because she isn’t going to jail.’
