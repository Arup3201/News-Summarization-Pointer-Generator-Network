Ross Hutchins has left his role as tournament director of the Aegon Championships to take up a new position as the ATP's vice-president of player relations.

The 29-year-old former Commonwealth Games silver medallist will be replaced at Queen's Club by the tournament's managing director Stephen Farrow.

Hutchins said: 'It was a privilege to be the tournament director of the Aegon Championships, but this is an opportunity I could not turn down.

'It's a great honour to join the ATP as vice-president, player relations. With my playing career only recently behind me, I've always known that I wanted to remain in professional tennis after retiring as a player.'

Doubles specialist Hutchins was diagnosed with Hodgkin's Lymphoma in 2012 and sat out the 2013 season while he was treated, before returning to action at the start of this year.

The former Davis Cup player partnered Taiwan's Chan Yung-jan to a place in the US Open mixed doubles semi-finals earlier this month, before announcing his playing retirement on September 12.

Hutchins represented Great Britain in several events, winning a silver medal in the Commonwealth Games
