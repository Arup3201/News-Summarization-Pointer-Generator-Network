A motorist who hit and killed a delivery man has walked free from court after claiming he was dazzled by the sun shining in his eyes.

Phillip White, 52, was accused of being 'on automatic pilot' when he hit Nigel Gutteridge, 61, as he unloaded wood from his lorry, pinning him against the back doors.

White, who lives just yards from the accident in Tiverton, Devon, was driving to work at the time and claimed to be travelling at 25 miles an hour, despite his van being found in fourth gear.

During the trial Mr Richard Crabb, prosecuting, asked him: 'You were on automatic pilot, making a journey you have done many times before?'

He said: 'I had seen the sun shining down the road before but never as bright as that morning. I had never known it that bright before.

'I put my visor down but can't remember where I was when I did so. I have asked myself a thousand times why I didn't see the lorry, but I never saw it.

'I got into my van that morning, got out onto the road and I hit the lorry. That is all I can remember.

'I don't know. I'm sorry. I never saw the lorry until I hit it.'

The jury also heard evidence from PC Philip Rowan-Smith who said he had recreated the journey the next day and found that he had to slow down due to bright sunshine.

The prosecution argued that if White had been blinded then he should also have slowed down, but no tyre marks were found at the scene and witnesses said they had not seen White use his brakes.

Prosecutor Richard Crabb said: 'Witnesses don't describe seeing any braking or swerving. He said he had been blinded by the sunlight, which was rising in the east in front of him.

'He had driven the road a thousand times and he must appreciate that the sun might be a problem at that time in the morning.

'He should have seen the lorry and driven around it and if he was dazzled by the sun, he should have slowed down.'

Fatal: Mr White hit Mr Gutteridge just off of Lea Road after leaving his house on Barle Court for work. Mr Gutteridge died instantly when he was pinned to the back of his lorry

Mr Gutteridge, from Thelbridge Cross, in Witheridge, was a former director of a tool hire firm and was semi-retired, only working for the deliver company part-time.

Gutteridge had just got out of his cab on April 10 2012 to start unloading his lorry when he was hit and died instantly.

White collapsed in the dock of Exeter Crown Court today as the not guilty verdict was read out by the jury.

Judge Phillip Wassall said: 'This is a tragic event whereby a man lost his life. My sympathies go to Mr Gutteridge's family.'

The case is not the only one in which a driver has pleaded not guilty, claiming the sun was in their eyes.

In November last year a jury failed to reach a verdict in the trial of 22-year-old Lauren Paul, from Hampshire, who killed lollipop man Raymond Elsmore as he was escorting a pregnant woman across the road.

Mr Elsmore died of head and chest injuries after being hit by Ms Paul at 3pm on December 5, 2012.

Ms Paul claimed she had been blinded by sunlight at the time and that she was also trying to clear condensation from her front window.

The prosecution have asked for a retrial at a date yet to be fixed.
