Former New York governor Eliot Spitzer has no qualms about hiding his new relationship with a much younger woman just weeks after his divorce was finalized.

The disgraced Democrat was spotted with his girlfriend Lis Smith at Monday night's Knicks game and it seemed like the pair didn't pay much attention to the court.

Spitzer, 54, and his former campaign manager Smith, 31, were seen kissing throughout the game against the Dallas Mavericks on Monday.

Going public: Former governor Eliot Spitzer and his campaign manager-turned-girlfriend Lis Smith were spotted kissing throughout Monday night's Knicks game at Madison Square Garden

In the spirit: The Kicks ended up losing by two points, but that didn't stop the pair from celebrating

Not shying away: Though the former Governor wore a baseball cap with his suit and tie, they did not to try to hide their faces during the game as their relationship is very much public after they were outed in December

The once-covert couple have now clearly let go of any attempts to keep their private lives private as they put on a full display at Madison Square Garden.

They cheered loudly and grabbed each other at different moments, going in for a kiss at more quiet points in the game.

The former Governor paired his suit and tie with a Yankees hat – a cap from a different sport – perhaps as an attempt to fly under the radar.

His girlfriend sported a similarly professional look, wearing a crisp white button-down, but opted against wearing her own baseball cap.

This is not the first time that the 
couple have made an appearance to support the home team, as they were 
spotted going to a Knicks game last month and following the victory with
 a drink-filled night at Brother Jimmy's, a bar across the street from 
Madison Square Garden.

The 
timing of that night out was interesting as Spitzer had a meeting with 
his lawyer to sign divorce papers the next morning, continuing the 
formal process of separation from his wife Silda Wall.

Together: Smith worked as Spitzer's comptroller campaign manager and they reportedly started dating after he lost- but while he was still legally married to his wife Silda

Consequences: After the news broke, she was no longer considered a candidate for the top spot as Bill de Blasio's press secretary

Their latest trip to a basketball game marked a different kind of milestone for the couple, as Ms. Smith has continued to put herself out into the public sphere but for more political reasons

After running Spitzer's failed 'comeback' campaign to become New York City's new comptroller, Smith joined Bill de Blasio's team and was widely considered to be the likely candidate for the mayor's press secretary.

Just as the final staffing decision was due to be made, photos were released that showed the former governor, who resigned years ago after admitting to soliciting prostitutes, sneaking in and out of Smith's apartment in December.

Now after spending almost two months under the radar, Smith is starting to actively try to restart her consulting career.

She
 is now working for the Democratic Governor's Association, paying close 
attention to Governor Martin O'Malley of Maryland who is considered a
 possible 2016 candidate should Hillary Clinton choose not to run for 
president.

Thrill of the game: This is the second time in as many months that Spitzer and Smith have been seen at Knicks games together

Rough call: Smith, 31, has written about how she was surprised by all of the female commentators who had a problem with her dating Spitzer, 54, who infamously had to resign from office after his trysts with prostitutes

On Sunday, Smith even made the surprising decision to pen an op-ed blasting her former boss' plans to pay for universal pre-K in New York City by taxing the city's rich.

'While de Blasio won the mayoral election in a walk, and earned his landslide with a bold platform of taxing the rich to expand pre-K, his heady victory obscured a stubborn fact: The power to decide this issue doesn’t reside in Gracie Mansion. It resides in Albany,' she wrote in the New York Daily News.

Her op-ed was matched up against one written by Chirlaine McCray, Bill de Blasio's wife.

'At this point, de Blasio should stop spending political capital on a losing fight, declare victory by taking Cuomo up on his offer of a blank check, and focus on running the city,' Smith wrote.

'For those who still have their money on de Blasio in this heavyweight matchup, I suggest moving it over to Cuomo – fast.'
