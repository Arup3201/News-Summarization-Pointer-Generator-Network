An incredibly rare Ferrari racing car which won a string of famous races in the 1950s has been tipped to set a world record by selling for 10 million pounds.

The Ferrari 375 Plus was among the quickest and most powerful racing cars of its time, notching up victories at Le Mans and Silverstone in 1954.

Just four racing versions of the car were ever made, while one road model was custom built for the King of Belgium.

The supercharged red motor, which boasts a 4.9-litre 330bhp V12 engine and a top speed of 175mph, was entrusted to only the best and bravest drivers of the time.

Its most famous victory was in the Carrera Pan-Americana road race through Mexico at the hands of Umberto Maglioli.

The Italian star drove the 2,000-mile course at an incredible average of 107mph and during one five hour period towards the end of the race he averaged 150mph.

After passing through the hands of 
several collectors it was bought in the 1990s by Ferrari importer 
Jacques Swaters, a close friend of Enzo Ferrari, who restored it to its 
former glory.

It is now being sold by Swaters' family following his death three years ago.

The car is tipped to fetch 10 million pounds, which if realised would break the world record for a racing Ferrari at auction.

Philip Kantor, motoring expert at auctioneers Bonhams, said: 'This is a very special car indeed.

'It
 is a works racing car which is rare in itself but on top of that only 
four racing models and one road version were ever built. This car is the
 first, and only four still remain.

'It has participated in some of the world's greatest racing events driven by some of the world's best drivers.

'Very
 importantly it has an undisputed chassis number - there is no other car
 in the world like it and its identity has never been called into 
question.

'In the 1990s it 
was beautifully restored by Jacques Swaters, a close friend of Enzo 
Ferrari, and it has since taken part in Le Mans Classic twice.

'It
 is being sold without reserve and we expect it to fetch at least 10 
million pounds which would be a world record for a racing Ferrari at 
auction.'

The auction will take place at Goodwood Festival of Speed in Chichester, West Sussex, on June 27.
