A small stable year in rural Hertfordshire is not necessarily the place where you might expect to find gold.

But that is exactly what happened when Britain's only gold Andalusian colt was born there last spring.

Now 18-months-old Pearl of Peace is a 
remarkable example of his extremely rare breed - made even more so by 
the fact that he was born with green eyes.

Born in March last year, Peal of Peace, is known as Oro which means gold in Spanish,where the breed originally comes from.Â 

But Oro is doubly rare as thanks to a genetic quirk he has two copies of the 'pearl' colour gene, one from both his mother and father.

And he has become an internet sensation with almost 200,000 fans of his Facebook page where his owner posts pictures and updates about his activities.

Christine Kershaw, 57, who owns Oro, also works as a mediator in the shipping industry and has been involved in helping to free hostages from Somali pirates.

She has only been breeding horses for four years so was delighted that her first her attempt to breed a Golden Andalusian horse worked so successfully.

She told the Sunday Times: 'I was absolutely overjoyed when Pearl of Peace was born.

'The stud phoned me because he had green eyes and they kept on saying: "We've never seen anything like it."

'Everyone who came up to the stud had to have a look at this horse with such an odd colour. Every time the vet goes to the yard he takes all his students to look.

'He is just this extraordinary colour and has the most weird sheen on his coat, even when he's dirty.'

She also explained how the horse came to have his 'double' pearl gene.

Star attraction: Pearl of Peace has become a hit with both visitors to his stables and online horse fans with nearly 200,000 followers on his Facebook site

She added: 'To produce this kind of horse you need two copies of the pearl gene. I bought a mare and purely by chance she had one copy of the gene.

'Then I found a stallion with two copies of the gene so I was guaranteed that one copy would come over. But I had only a 50-50 chance that the mare would pass the other copy over and so basically the first time I really tried, I pulled it off and bred Pearl of Peace.'

Pearl of Peace was born with green eyes and a bright blond mane but over time that has darkened slightly and his eyes are now hazel.

There are believed to be around 185,000 Andalusian or Pure Race Spanish horses registered worldwide.

Their ancestors have lived in Spain for thousands of years and since the breed was recognised in the fifteenth century the characteristics have changed very little and been prized by the nobility for their prowess as a war horses.
