According to an arrest affidavit obtained by KFOX14, she recognized her assailant as a man who owed her husband money and screamed out his name.

The 31-year-old mother-to-be, who was nine months pregnant, was rushed to University Medical Center in critical condition suffering from multiple stab wounds and fractures to her body and face.

According to police, the wounded victim was able to call 911 and give the name of the suspect to police.

Meanwhile, Justin Poole called the 19-year-old's co-workers, who helped apprehend Moss and seized the knife allegedly used in the attack.

Following his arrest, police said Moss admitted to stabbing Rachel Poole

The teenager has been charged with criminal attempted capital murder and was ordered held on $60,000 bond.

Neighbors
told KFOX14 they that Moss owed the Pooles money for car repairs 
because he had borrowed a vehicle from them and wrecked it.

According
to El Paso police, Moss, a soldier attached to Fort Bliss, went to the 
Pooles' home in the 9400 block of Wichita Circle to talk to Rachel Poole
about the money he owed her husband.

The woman wasn't home, so the 19-year-old allegedly forced his way into the house and lay in ambush, waiting for her to return.

When
Poole came home, she opened the Apple video chat program FaceTime on 
her phone and began talking to her husband, who is stationed in 
southwest Asia.

Suspect: Cory Bernard Moss, 19, allegedly admitted to the knife attack, which was reportedly sparked by a money dispute

A short time later, police say Moss 
came out of hiding and surprised Rachel Poole from behind, repeatedly 
stabbing her with a foldout stainless steel knife and beating her.

According
to the affidavit, the victim instantly recognized Moss as her husband's
debtor and yelled out his name several times so Justin Poole could hear
it over the phone.

Following the attack, police say Moss fled and called a co-worker to pick him up and drive him to Fort Bliss.

Meanwhile, Justin Pele Poole called Moss' colleagues to alert them of the suspect’s imminent return to the military base.

The 19-year-old's co-workers intercepted him and found the knife in the car where he was riding.

Fort Bliss spokesman Joe Buccino said that Army Pvt Poole has been deployed in southwest Asia for the past nine months, HLN-TV reported.

He arrived home in El Paso sometime 
today, and is not likely to be sent back to his overseas posting in the 
wake of the attack on his wife.

On
Wednesday, a furious Justin Pele Poole took to his Facebook page to 
express his anger with the situation, writing in part: 'I promised to 
give my life for this freedom not the other way around. I failed her but
never again.’

This 
afternoon, the soldier wrote on his page that he had the 'hardest 
conversation' of his life with his wounded wife over the phone.

According
to Justin Poole, Rachel Poole told him that she had lost an eye in the 
attack and asked him if it was a 'deal breaker' for him.

‘My wife is my wife til I'm no longer breathing,’ the serviceman wrote. ‘No man can change that and though I was not here to protect her this time it will never happen again that's my word.’

Today he introduced the couple's daughter to Facebook friends.

'In case you are wondering Rachel Poole is fighting to beat this but here is why she is fighting so hard. We love you baby,' he wrote.

Tragically, he added that the couple's dog had died after being left alone in the house following the attack on Rachel Poole.

According to a GoFundMe page set up for the Pooles, Rachel Poole is still in a critical condition and baby Isabella is sick from the medications doctors had to give her mother.
