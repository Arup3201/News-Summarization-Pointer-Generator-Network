Bogus: Alberto Nunez, 32, has been charged with practicing dentistry without a license and unlawful possession of hypodermic needles

A Chicago man has been charged with illegally practicing dentistry for at least two years, during which time he did everything from teeth cleaning to root canals and surgeries, according to police.

Alberto Nunez, 32, was hit with a slew of charges on Friday, including felony practicing dentistry without a license and unlawful possession of hypodermic syringes, the Cook County Sheriff’s Office said.

‘This wasn't something where the person was cleaning teeth out of his garage,’ Cook County Sheriff Tom Dart told NBC5, adding that Nunez’s makeshift dental office had all the necessary equipment.

Although the 32-year-old did not have a dentistry license, police said it did not stop him from setting up a busy practice at a home in Melrose Park serving about 30 patients a week.

Police received a tip about Nunez and tried to set up a sting operation, but the pseudo-dentist was so swamped with clientele that an undercover officer had to wait for a week to get an appointment.

Once inside, Fox News reported that the officer found a dental chair, syringes, an X-ray machine and other tools of the trade, according to authorities.

‘The fire department was just blown away because there wasn't a major fire there because there were so many wires that were running everywhere, in and out of garages and under sidewalks that clearly were done by probably someone with fifth-grade electrician background,’ said Dart.

Police stopped a patient who had just left the office and were told that Nunez had performed a root canal on him.

Nunez is not registered with the State of Illinois. He told police that he attended dental school in Mexico City, but could not provide documentation proving it, police said.

Busy practice: Nunez would see as many as 30 patients a week at his office located inside a private home in the suburb of Melrose Park

According to Dart, Nunez had seen hundreds of patients over the course of two years, performing bite impressions, teeth cleaning and surgical procedures. Before opening the Melrose Place office, he had reportedly worked out of another location.  

Investigators told CBS2 they suspect that Nunez’s practice catered toward undocumented immigrants and may have been a cash operation.

It remains unknown whether his patients knew their ‘doctor’ was unlicensed.

Nunez was issued a $10,000 bond. He is expected back in court on September 6.
