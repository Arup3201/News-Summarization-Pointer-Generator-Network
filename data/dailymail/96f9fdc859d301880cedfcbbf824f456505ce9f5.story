A man who was tortured and killed by the Taliban while visiting relatives in Afghanistan was targeted by the violent regime specifically because of his dual Afghan-Australian citizenship.

Sayed Habib Musawi, 56, from Sydney, was travelling from the Jaghori to Ghazni province in southern Afghanistan when he was targeted and captured by the Taliban. 

According to Mr Musawi family, he was on a minibus heading back to Kabul when insurgents boarded the vehicle and demanded him to identify himself.

Mohammad Ali Ahmadi, the deputy governor of the Ghazni province, has told the ABC that Mr Musawi was singled out by the Taliban because they think 'Australia is an infidel country'.

'The reason of his murder was very clear – that he was a dual citizen, he came from a country that Taliban think is an infidel country,' Mr Ahmadi said.

'Of course the reason is that he was an Afghan-Australian.

'When the Taliban arrested him, he said to them, "I came from Australia to see my family." And then the Taliban... issued an order for his murder.

'He didn't do anything besides that – he didn't do anything wrong, he wasn't a criminal, he wasn't involved in government activities.'

The man's son Nemat Musawi, 23, said the family was 'devastated... we can't believe it' and suspected the attack was a 'set up'.

'I just spoke to my dad a week-and-a-half ago and he was with family members and he said he was going to call me back,' he said.

'I was waiting for his call and then the next thing I hear he's been shot dead by Taliban three times.

'It seems like it was all set up, because they just stopped the bus on the way to Ghazni and then they just went straight to my dad, called him and pulled him out of the bus'.

Whilst members of the Hazara community attempted to negotiate with the Taliban, raising hopes that he would be released, Mr Musawi's body was found on Tuesday. 

He had three bullet wounds on his body, once through his neck and twice in his chest, and also showed signs of torture.

Mr Musawi's daughter, Kubra Musawi said that the family was in shock, and despite reporting the death to the federal Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, had received no assistance from the government. 

'He’s an Australian citizen and yet nothing’s happened yet. I’m not in a good condition to do all the paperwork; I’m in a bad situation. I don’t know what’s going on, no one has been contact,' Ms Musawi told The Guardian.

A spokesperson from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade said that the family was being assisted by the government.

'The Australian Embassy in Kabul continues to seek to confirm reports an Australian-Afghan dual national has been killed in Afghanistan,' a department spokesman said.

Ms Musawi, who is based in Sydney, wants the Australian government to investigate how the political fundamentalist group managed to locate her father. 

'I want the government to find out how the Taliban knew how my dad was going back to Kabul. It is obvious they got a report about him because they went onto the minibus and said "Sayed Habib, get up," she said.

Mr Habib was travelling from Jaghori to Ghazni province in southern Afghanistan when he was targeted and captured by the Taliban.

'He wasn’t anything to do with the government there. They just wanted to stop him coming back to Australia. I don’t want anyone else to experience this. Every minute we think of my brother’s family who are still there, I can’t study or work because of the stress of it.'

Mr Musawi had been living in Australia since 2000, and had returned to Afghanistan in May, hoping to travel to visit the his daughter-in-law and grandchildren when the region stabilised. 

'The area where these events reportedly occurred is contested by the Taliban and it will be difficult to obtain definitive and official confirmation of the man's death from the Afghanistan government,' said the DFAT spokesperson. 

There have been numerous reports of ethnic and religious minorities being persecuted and murdered in the area recently, with the Australian government reinforcing that Afghanistan is still listed as 'not safe to travel'. 

According to the United Nations, the Taliban and their allies were responsible for between 75 per cent and 80 per cent of Afghan civilian casualties in the past five years. 

The Hazari community has been regularly persecuted by the Taliban, and despite a slight improvement since the ousting of the political fundamentalist group, the population continues to experience violence.  

Australia has received large numbers of Afghan refugees, many of whom are members of the Hazari community, over the last decade.
