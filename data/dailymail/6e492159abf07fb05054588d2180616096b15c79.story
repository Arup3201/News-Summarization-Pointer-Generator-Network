Manchester City stars including Yaya Toure, Bacary Sagna and James Milner were fitted for their new club suits ahead of the upcoming season.

The Premier League champions have teamed up with British shirt maker and tailor TM Lewin to provide the official team suits, shirts and ties for Manuel Pellegrini’s men.

Players including the likes of Vincent Kompany, David Silva, Samir Nasri and Edin Dzeko will wear the bespoke suits while traveling to UEFA Champions League games across Europe, and Cup Finals throughout the season.
