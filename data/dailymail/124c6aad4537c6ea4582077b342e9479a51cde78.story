A second-half hat-trick from Antoine Griezmann inspired Atletico Madrid as they came from behind to beat Athletic Bilbao 4-1 at the San Mames stadium in La Liga on Sunday.

Bilbao went ahead on 17 minutes when Mikel Rico headed in, and the hosts were comfortable in their play up to half-time.

But Diego Simeone must have had stern words with his La Liga champions. 

Athletic Bilbao: Iraizoz, De Marcos, Gurpegi, Etxeita, Balenziaga, San Jose, Balenziaga, Susaeta, López Cabrera, Muniain, Aduriz.

Subs: Moran, Etxebarria Urkiaga, Gómez, Bustinza Martínez, Herrerín Buisán, Fernández Hierro, Aketxe.

Scorers: Rico 17 

Atletico Madrid: Moya, Juanfran, Giménez de Vargas, Godín, Siqueira, Turan, Gabi, Tiago, Niguez, Raúl Garcia, Griezmann.

Subs: Suarez, Jimenez, Oblak, Gamez, Rodríguez, Hernández, Keita

Scorers: Griezmann 46, 73, 81,  Raul Garcia 53. 

Att: 46,500 

The urgency in their play was instantly noticeable as the second period started and Antoine Griezmann hauled the Madrid club level immediately after the break with a header. 

Tiago then won a soft penalty for Atletico seven minutes later, tumbling over in the penalty area after minimal contact from a Mikel San Jose challenge.

Raul Garcia stepped up and converted, sending goalkeeper Gorka Iraizoz the wrong way.

Griezmann then secured the victory in superb fashion on 73. He controlled a crossfield pass from Gabi with the outside of his boot before closing in on goal and lashing assuredly past Iraizoz.

He then completed his treble from close range after Garcia's shot at goal was blocked. 

The win leaves the Simeone's side three points behind league leaders Real Madrid going into the Christmas break, and in third position in the Spanish league.
