More than 120,000 pensioners will miss out on state assistance with their long-term care every year thanks to the Government’s decision to ignore the findings of an independent commission, a think-tank said yesterday.

Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt confirmed he will set a cap of £75,000 on the amount people have to contribute to their personal care needs, with the State paying the rest.

But this is far higher than the £35,000 cap recommended two years ago by a commission headed by economist Andrew Dilnot, who yesterday expressed ‘regret’ the cap had been set so high.

Think-tank Demos said the £75,000 cap would help no more than one in six pensioners over their lifetime, while a £35,000 cap would have helped one in three.

The higher cap means more than 120,000 pensioners will miss out on state help each year.

Claudia Wood, deputy director of Demos, said: ‘For the Coalition to consider putting the cap at £75,000 is unambitious, miserly, and will do little to solve one of the most vital social problems facing our generation.

‘A cap of £75,000 means that the majority of people will still be paying just as much on their social care as they would have before the cap.’ 

Mr Dilnot told the BBC’s Today Programme that it was a shame the cap had been set so high, but insisted it would mean that pensioners no longer had to be ‘terrified’ of the consequences of needing care. ‘We said it should be between £25,000 and £50,000 in 2010/11 prices,’ he said.

‘The cap that is being proposed is £75,000, we think in 2017 prices. That’s the equivalent of £61,000 in our terms, so it is higher than we would have wanted.

‘I regret that but I recognise that the public finances are in a pretty tricky state.’

How the new system will work

Michelle Mitchell from charity Age UK said: ‘The Government has taken a brave step towards bringing older people and their families peace of mind in contemplating future care costs.

While the £75,000 level will temper rather than dispel anxiety for most around care costs, it is an important principle that no-one should be left to face spiralling care needs alone.’ 

Mr Hunt told MPs that the cap would protect families from the ‘limitless and often ruinous cost’ of care. Labour’s health spokesman Andy Burnham said: ‘This is a step forward, but it is a faltering one.’
