Stressful events such as moving house or the death of a loved one could lead people to develop dementia, researchers have suggested.

Experts have been investigating the role stress plays in causing Alzheimer's, and claim that certain 'traumatic experiences' are factors in developing the condition.

The study, being led by Professor Clive Holmes at the University of Southampton, will monitor 140 people aged over 50 with mild cognitive impairment during an 18-month period.

Traumatic experiences such as the death of a loved one or moving house could develop Alzheimers, experts have claimed

The participants will be assessed for levels of stress and any progression from mild cognitive impairment to dementia.

About 60 per cent of people with mild cognitive impairment are known to go on to develop Alzheimer's.

Prof Holmes said: 'All of us go through stressful events. We are looking to understand how these may become a risk factor for the development of Alzheimer's.

Moving house could be 'a potential factor' in causing Alzheimers

'Something such as bereavement or a traumatic experience - possibly even moving home - is also a potential factor.

'This is the first stage in developing ways in which to intervene with psychological or drug-based treatments to fight the disease.

'We are looking at two aspects of stress relief - physical and psychological - and the body's response to that experience.'

The study is part of a Â£1.5 million 
package of six grants being given by the charity to find the cause of 
the disease, a cure and a way to prevent it.

Society research manager Anne Corbett said: 'The study will look at the
role chronic stress plays in the progression from mild thinking and 
memory problems - mild cognitive impairment - to Alzheimer's disease.

'We
feel this is a really important area of research that needs more 
attention. The results could offer clues to new treatments or better 
ways of managing the condition.

'It
will also be valuable to understand how different ways of coping with 
stressful life events could influence the risk of developing Alzheimer's
disease.'
