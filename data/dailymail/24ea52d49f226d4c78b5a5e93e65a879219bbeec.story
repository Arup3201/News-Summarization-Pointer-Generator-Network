A handyman has been jailed for 10 years after he accidentally killed his girlfriend with a homemade cannon.

Richard Fox, a 41-year-old explosives enthusiast, was loading the cannon at his trailer park home in Petrero - a small mountain community close to California's border with Mexico - when it exploded unexpectedly.

Shrapnel from the unintentional blast penetrated the trailer, instantly killing Fox's girlfriend Jeanette Ogara, 38, but leaving the couple's four-year-old daughter Vanessa unharmed.

Fox pleaded guilty to felony charges relating to the explosion of a destructive device causing death, and possession of materials to carry out such an act - with the prosecution accepting his argument that it had never been his intention to kill his girlfriend.

The freak accident took place on March 3, 2012 when Fox and a friend stood outside the trailer drinking alcohol while they loaded the homemade cannon with powder extracted from fireworks.

The 21-inch-long, two-inch-thick steel pipe exploded before he had finished preparing it, badly burning Fox and scattering large chunks of metal around the area.

Several pieces of shrapnel penetrated the walls of the nearby trailer, where Fox had lived with Ms Ogara and their young daughter for a number of years.

Ms Ogara was killed instantly, but the child and three other adults in the home were unharmed.

Fox reportedly broke down in tears during his sentencing at the El Cajon branch of the San Diego County Superior Court, pleading with the family of his late girlfriend for forgiveness. 

'I am truly sorry from the bottom of my heart,' the LA Times quoted him as saying.

During the trial John Arnold, a neighbor, told U-T San Diego said Fox: 'liked experimenting with guns, and it looks like this experiment went bad.'

He added that Fox 'adores Jeanette and Vanessa. They mean the world to him. I can’t imagine how he feels right now. He probably doesn’t want to live.'

Moments after the cannon went off Fox phoned his brother Jerry and said: 'I’m sorry, I’m sorry, it should have been me.'

Fox was treated at a hospital for shrapnel wounds to his right leg and arrested for investigation of exploding a device resulting in death.

The homemade cannon was filled with black powder taken from fireworks, as well as components called 'salutes' and aluminum foil, Retired Detective Robert Luke testified during the trial.

The foil was so tightly stuffed into the device that the lack of air flow prevented the device releasing properly, he said.

The couple were already well known in the local community before the accident, with Fox noted for his 'striking' appearance - he is tall, thin and heavily tattooed - and Ms Ogara described as an 'exotic beauty' by neighbours

Fox's defense attorney Thomas Slattery had argued that his client was unaware of the consequences because he'd lit similar devices in the past without any problems

The couple were already well known in the local community before the accident, with Fox noted for his 'striking' appearance - he is tall, thin and heavily tattooed - and Ms Ogara described as an 'exotic beauty' by neighbours.

Jerry Fox said his brother had always lived his life 'on the edge'.

'He is one of those people who likes to take things apart and put things back together and likes to see how things work,' he added.

Fox served in prison in the 1990s for vehicle theft and possession of weapons – something Judge Patricia Cookson said convinced her to give Fox the maximum sentence for his crimes.

He will, however, receive credit for the two years he has already served in jail while awaiting trial.
