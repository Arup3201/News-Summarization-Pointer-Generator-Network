When Michelle Clark lost her fiance and her newborn twins there was only one ray of hope for her.

Her fiance Karl Davis died of cancer and her infants both died - all within four months of each other.

But Miss Clark refused to give up on her fiance’s dream of having children - and she has now given birth to baby son Max, thanks to IVF treatment using her dead husband’s sperm.

Miss Clark, 32, an administration officer for Salford council who lives in Walkden, Greater Manchester, said: ‘It was so devastating for me to lose Karl and the twins, but now I have a little bit of Karl to keep forever.'

From darkness, light: Miss Clark's fiance died of leukaemia in 200, but refused to give up on his dream of having children - and she has now given birth to baby son Max

Mr Davis had been battling leukaemia for nearly three years with chemotherapy and two bone marrow transplants when the couple went for their first course of IVF treatment

She added: ‘I will never forget either Karl or the babies - but now I can finally look forward to the future and having a wonderful life with Max.’

The couple first met 12 years ago in November 2001 after meeting through a family member.

But then in 2007, Mr Davis, started vomiting regularly in the mornings. He went into hospital but was sent home after doctors told him he was suffering from heartburn.

Miss Clark said: ‘I was so worried about him. But as we were on the way back to hospital later that same day, they rang with blood test results that they had taken on our first visit, and told us to get back to the hospital quickly.’

When the couple returned they were told that Mr Davis had leukaemia and he needed to start chemotherapy treatment straight away.

Heartbreaking: Twin Ria before she died. her son Karl also lost his fight for life too, just six days later

Miss Clark said: ‘It was such a big shock. We had no idea that it was anything as serious as cancer. Karl was only 24, how could he possibly have cancer. It was too much to take in.’

Mr Davis started his treatment, but beforehand he froze some sperm samples as doctors told him it would affect his fertility.

Miss Clark said: ‘We had wanted to start a family, and we knew that because of the chemotherapy treatment this would be the only way.’

Mr Davis had been battling leukaemia for nearly three years with chemotherapy and two bone marrow transplants when the couple went for their first course of IVF treatment in the summer of 2010. Amazingly Miss Clarke fell pregnant.

She said: ‘It was the one bit of good news for us that we’d had in years. Karl was so incredibly happy at the thought of being a dad. It really gave him a boost.’

Happy and healthy: Max was born in June last year. Miss Clark said: 'It was such an emotional moment when he was born, I just wished Karl had been there to meet his son'

But as Miss Clark’s bump grew bigger, Mr Davis was in increasing pain. At the hospital they were given the worst possible diagnosis. The cancer had spread and there was nothing else that could be done.

Miss Clark said: ‘It was devastating. Karl had fought so hard, but he’d already had so much treatment and two bone marrow transplant too, yet still the cancer had spread.

‘We went to our first scan and saw our babies’ little heartbeats pumping away on the screen.

'Both the embryos had taken and I was pregnant with twins.

‘We should have been overjoyed, but it was so bittersweet as we didn’t even know if Karl would survive long enough to meet his babies.’

In September 2010 when Miss Clark was three months pregnant, Mr Davis tragically lost his fight for life at the age of 27.

Miss Clark said: ‘I had these two lives growing inside me, and instead of buying baby clothes and decorating the nursery, I was burying their father. If it wasn’t for the babies I would have found it difficult to carry on.’

In January 2011, when Miss Clark was seven months pregnant she went into premature labour. Her twins Karl was born weighing just 1Ib13 and his twin sister Ria at 1Ib12.

Miss Clark said: ‘They looked so fragile and for two weeks I never left their side, just praying that they would survive.’

But just four months after she had buried her fiance ,Miss Clark also lost her tiny newborn daughter, and then her son Karl also lost his fight for life too, just six days later.

She said: ‘I had lost my fiance and my twins such a short time. My only consolation was that Karl would be there to look after our two angels in heaven.

‘I’d clung to that hope that I would have something of Karl left, now that had been taken away from me too.’

Miss Clark was so determined to fulfill her fiance’s wish of having a family, that she underwent a second course of IVF alone, in November 2011.

She suffered an ectopic pregnancy and lost the baby, but a third course of IVF in September 2012 proved successful.

Miss Clark said: ‘I was terrified all the way through the pregnancy that I was going to lose this baby too.’

Luckily her pregnancy went smoothly and baby Max was born in June last year at St Mary’s Hospital in Manchester, weighing a healthy 9Ib1oz.

Miss Clark said: ‘It was such an emotional moment when he was born, I just wished Karl had been there to meet his son. He would have been so proud of him.

‘He’s doing really well now and he’s so like Karl - he’s the spitting image of him. And when he’s old enough I will tell him all about his daddy and what a special person he was.’
