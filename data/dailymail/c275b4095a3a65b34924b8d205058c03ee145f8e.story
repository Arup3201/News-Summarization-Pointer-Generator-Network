Jeremy Paxman said he believes former prime minister Sir Winston Churchill (above), who died in 1965, would be ‘suffocated’ by modern-day politics

Steering the country through a savage war, Sir Winston Churchill is proudly remembered as one of Britain’s greatest ever leaders.

But the former prime minister would no longer be seen as electable, according to Jeremy Paxman, who said he would be ‘suffocated’ by today’s politics.

Ahead of the 50th anniversary of Churchill’s death on Saturday, the veteran broadcaster also said the politician could be a ‘ruthless egotist, a chancer, and a charlatan.’

And speaking to The Radio Times, presenter Jonathan Dimbleby added Churchill was a ‘democratic dictator’ who would not be suited to modern day Westminster.

The former prime minister died on January 24, 1965, just days after suffering a severe stroke and, to mark his passing, the BBC1 is broadcasting Churchill: A Nation’s Farewell, next Wednesday.

In the programme, Paxman, 64, tells the story of the politician’s state funeral, the first granted to a commoner since the Duke of Wellington in 1852.

But speaking to the magazine ahead of the programme’s broadcast, the former Newsnight presenter, said: ‘Any rounded assessment of Winston Churchill’s life has to acknowledge that he was a ruthless egotist, a chancer, and a charlatan at times. 

'Would he be electable now? I fear not. He was a man of his time, a parliamentary one-off who’d be suffocated by the spinning and posturing that pass for politics today.’

Jonathan Dimbleby, 70, whose father Jonathan provided the commentary for the millions watching Churchill’s funeral on television, agreed with this assessment and added that those would wish to see a Churchill-style figure save modern Britain are living in a fantasy.

He said: ‘I’m not sure whether a Churchill would be appropriate for the complexities of peace-time politics. 

'The greatness of Churchill was that he was, effectively, a democratic dictator. 

'He ruled Britain. That was an extraordinary power in the hands of one man. I don’t think that would work very well today. 

In a documentary marking the 50th anniversary of Churchill’s death, which is to be aired next Wednesday, former Newsnight presenter Jeremy Paxman (pictured), describes the  politician as a ‘ruthless' and a 'chancer'

'The idea that a “strong men” could wave a wand and everyone would automatically follow, and our problems would be over, seems to be to be an indulgence that should be left to the birds.’

Then, suggesting no modern politician would have the ability to step into Churchill’s shoes, he continued: ‘In a way I rather hope that there aren’t. 

'Churchill is the greatest man of the last century, don’t get me wrong. 

'He was a very great leader with extraordinary energy, and he also had a much greater strategic sense than critics give him credit for.

'But I don’t think people today would relish dictators, however democratically elected they might be.

In the programme, Paxman, 64, tells the story of the politician’s state funeral, the first granted to a commoner since the Duke of Wellington in 1852

‘I think it’s very difficult for an individual who can’t comfortably command a majority of his or her party to succeed. 

'To command in a modern democracy, you have to be willing to compromise, to give and take. 

'If you march forward from the front, you end up leading your troops into the valley of death, politically, or you find that you’re marching by yourself and your troops have deserted you. 

'That is the challenge that modern politicians face.’
