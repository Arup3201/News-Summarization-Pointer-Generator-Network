This was the scene which greeted police rescue workers when a train was derailed during a landslide, filling the carriages with mud.

The train was pushed off the tracks as it passed Qingyuan city in southern China's Guangdong Province this morning, and into the path of a rain-triggered landslide.

Some twelve carriages were derailed, as mud poured into the train - coating the walls of the train and passengers in a thick layer of dirt and silt.
