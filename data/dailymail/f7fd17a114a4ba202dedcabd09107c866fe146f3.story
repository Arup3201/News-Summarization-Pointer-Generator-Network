A little under a week ago David Beckham was in attendance at the World Cup final in Brazil, but just a few days later back in LA he was getting dripped in golden goo after he was slimed at the Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Sports Awards in Los Angeles on Thursday.

Beckham - incidently know worldwide as goldenboots - was alongside his two youngest boys, Cruz and Romeo, as the trio took part in an on-stage act.

The former England captain was one son short as he attended the popular children's event at the UCLA Pauley Pavilion.

And ever the old pro, the jolly former LA Galaxy star still managed to raise a smile after being covered in the unsavory liquid.

And while he always seems to come out of everything smelling of roses, this was the one occasion where the England star's luck ran out.

While he was able to grin and bear it, his nine-year-old son Cruz looked rather devastated his snazzy T-shirt had been ruined in the incident.
