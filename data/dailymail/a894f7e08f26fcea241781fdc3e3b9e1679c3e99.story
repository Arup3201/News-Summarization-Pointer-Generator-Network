A council has been forced to pay a former school technician more than £100,000 after colleagues fashioned male genitalia from Blu-Tack and stuck them to her telephone.

Male staff at Baldragon Academy in Dundee also scrawled pictures of penises on drawings devout Christian Margaret Malcolm, 56, had done for her Brownie pack during a 'shameful' campaign of sexual harassment.

An employment tribunal in the city also heard that they used 'coarse industrial language' directly in front of Miss Malcolm, who they were aware was deeply religious, and that they regularly baited her.

Devout: Christian Margaret Malcolm, 56, was subjected to harassment of an 'obscene and shameful nature' by male colleagues at Baldragon Academy in Dundee, a tribunal heard

The tribunal ruled that the behaviour of three of Miss Malcolm's male colleagues was 'of an obscene and shameful nature', after several episodes dating back from 2001 were recounted at the hearing.

A judgement published yesterday found Miss Malcolm had been subjected to 'serious' sexual harassment over a period of several months.

The tribunal ruled she should be awarded damages from Dundee City Council.

The tribunal was told about another episode with a slogan to do with a Dundee Football Club player from 2001.

The judgment published yesterday said a male colleague wrote on a noticeboard 'Caniggia is God' in a reference to the Argentinian footballer Claudio Caniggia, who signed for Dundee in 2000.

When she saw it, Miss Malcolm changed 'God' to 'good' but the male colleague changed it back.

According to the judgement, Miss Malcolm's colleagues 'decided to conduct a planned campaign of obscene behaviour against Miss Malcolm because they considered that she was a vulnerable individual who was very naive sexually and a devout Christian'/

The judgement added: 'It was sexual harassment of a serious kind and went on for seven or eight months.'

The tribunal ruled that Miss Malcolm should receive £25,000 from Dundee City Council for the injury to her feelings, and remarked that - although she had complained on several occasions to her superior - no satisfactory action was taken by the authority to ensure there was no repeat of the obscene behaviour by the three men.

The council was also ordered to pay her £12,500 for psychiatric injury and £25,603 for loss of earnings.

The sums amount to £63,103 and the tribunal ruled that she should also receive interest at 8 per cent from as far back as 2001 - plus a sum for loss of pension rights.

This puts the total at more than £100,000.

'Long and complicated': Miss Malcolm left her position as a school technician at Baldragon Academy in 2002

The council accepted that they owed compensation to Miss Malcolm for the unlawful and 'plainly shameful' conduct of their employees between May and December 2001.

Miss Malcolm's case has a long history and was returned to the tribunal from the Court of Session in Edinburgh, where a judge said the time and expense involved in Margaret Malcolm's row with Dundee City Council was 'staggering'.

The judge Lord Malcolm called for a deal to be reached and chronicled the 'long and complicated saga' which an employment appeals tribunal had described as 'a mess'.

Miss Malcolm left her job early in 2002 and in April of that year she went to an employment tribunal alleging sexual harassment by fellow employees and blamed the local authority.

After a legal row about whether she had waited too long before going to the tribunal, a series of hearings went ahead but in April 2003 her claims were dismissed.

Although the tribunal accepted that the harassment had happened, they ruled that the council was not 'vicariously liable'.

In March 2004 the decision was reversed after it was revealed that one of the tribunal members, ill at the time, had fallen asleep.

A fresh tribunal heard the case again between March 2005 and November 2006, and there were further hearings in each of the next three years before the case arrived at Scotland's highest civil court.

In sending the case back, Lord Malcolm expressed concern that the long and expensive saga had occurred in a system which was supposed to improve efficiency and cut costs.

A spokesman for Dundee City Council said today: 'We are studying the details of the judgement thoroughly.'
