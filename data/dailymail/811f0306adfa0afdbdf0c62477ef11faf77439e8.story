These images show the terrifying moment a lion turned on a pair of children hanging out of their car window to photograph it.

The children, a boy and a girl, were allowed to get within metres of two of the deadly animals in Kruger National Park, South Africa.

Fortunately, after the male growled and lurched at the pair, it turned around to leave the scene with its female companion.

The adults in this car have been criticised for allowing the children to lean out and photograph these lions

They got to within metres of the deadly animal, which growled and lurched at them after a minute

The car pulled up close to the wild animals after another vehicle had moved on.

The children appeared to use a camera and a tablet device to photograph and possibly video the creatures. Another electronic device is visible poking through the front window.

A minute after the car parked, the male lion jumped up towards the children - who ducked back into the car, but continued to film the lions with the window open.

Luckily, the lions, which were surrounded by a group of vehicles watching them, turned around and left the area.

Commenters on the video, uploaded on to Live Leak yesterday, have condemned the adults in the car for allowing the children to get so close.

The user who uploaded the clip said: ‘This is very irresponsible behaviour by the parents of these children!

‘Please obey all rules if you visit a wildlife park! These animals are not tame and will attack if provoked!’

Commenters on the video also criticised the behaviour. One said: ‘By the time the parent behind the wheel had even put the car in gear that lion would be using a tooth pick.’

Another added: ‘Those kids were lucky! Those cats could have leaped in and killed them with one swipe of the paw!’

A third said: ‘That lion could have jumped up and grabbed one of those kids in a split second.’
