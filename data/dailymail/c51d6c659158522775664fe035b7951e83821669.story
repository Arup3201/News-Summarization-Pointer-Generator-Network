It's the Youtube phenomenon that makes parents shudder and puts teachers in a tizzy. Now Am I Pretty, an online trend that began in the USA, has been turned into a play.

The brainchild of artist Louise Orwin, Pretty Ugly charts her foray into the world of pretty/ugly videos in which girls, most of whom are in their early teens, post clips of themselves and ask viewers to tell them whether or not they're good-looking.

Unsurprisingly, some of the comments are cruel in the extreme and even more worryingly, many of the clearly under-age girls are propositioned by men - nearly all of whom are well past the age of 18.

Experiment: Louise (pictured) posed as a teenager to see what sort of response Pretty/Ugly videos get

Among them are 'SmileLoveBeauty8', a pretty dark haired girl who appears to be no older than 13, whose video shows her striking a series of poses, including provocative shots of her lying in bed and a close-up of her cleavage.

Underneath the video, more than 12,000 comments have been submitted ranging from the concerned ('you are asking for paedos') to the approving ('God made you beautiful') and the downright nasty ('ugly as f***').

Orwin is no stranger to this sort of comment herself, having experimented by putting three different pretty/ugly videos - all differently styled - on the site.

The feedback shocked her. 'I got torrents of abuse,' revealed the 26-year-old artist in an interview with Wired magazine.

Blog: Louise has now launched a website and blog detailing her experiences in the Am I Pretty? world

'People were telling me to f*** off and die. I woke up and read all of this abuse and I really felt it in my stomach. I had to remind myself that it's not me, it's the character.'

Her new show, which will top the billing at the Camden People's Theatre from the 23rd October until the 5th November, is based on her experiences and begins with her posing the pretty/ugly question to the audience.

It is, she argues, important to try and understand what's going on and where the desire to be judged on your looks comes from.

'Now if you look on Tumblr, YouTube, Twitter, it's not the media, but the teenage girls themselves perpetuating this myth [of beauty].

Worrying: Many of the comments posted below the videos are cruel or have inappropriate content

'They are resharing these images, reblogging. There's always going to be peer pressure but I think [social media] makes these issues worse.'

And to stop it? The answer, she concludes, is not stricter parental locks but getting girls to take more responsibility for themselves.

'It's about changing attitudes towards things and teaching girls to take responsibility for themselves online.'

You can only hope that her play and blog succeed in persuading them to do so.
