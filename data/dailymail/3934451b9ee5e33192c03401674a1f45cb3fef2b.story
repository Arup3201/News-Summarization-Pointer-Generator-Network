Jose Mourinho has reignited his feud with Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini by claiming he ‘killed Mark Clattenburg’.

Pellegrini criticised Chelsea’s manager after the 1-1 draw between their teams at the Etihad Stadium last Sunday and accused Mourinho of approaching the game ‘like a small team’.

Mourinho finally responded yesterday by reminding Pellegrini —who rarely gets involved in confrontations — that he broke his own rules last season by criticising Clattenburg.

The official was in charge when City lost 3-2 at Liverpool at the end of the season and when they drew at Arsenal in the title run-in.

Mourinho said: ‘It was not one or two or three times that he told everyone he doesn’t speak about referees. He killed Clattenburg.

‘Three or four times he says he doesn’t speak about me or my teams — he did it once more. It’s for you to comment. When I said I don’t want to speak about him, that’s what I try to do 

Mourinho and Pellegrini have never seen eye to eye, with the Chilean attacking the Chelsea manager's tactics

‘Don’t speak with me. If you want a story, speak with him, not me. I follow my line. I don’t want to discuss any situation.’

Mourinho is preparing for today’s home clash with Aston Villa in the Barclays Premier League without Brazil midfielder Ramires. He has a groin injury and has already been ruled out of the Champions League group game against Sporting on Tuesday and next Sunday’s date with Arsenal.

Mourinho hopes Ramires will be available after the international break. Yesterday, he also spoke about his concerns if Spain call up Diego Costa next week for their Euro 2016 qualifiers. The Chelsea forward missed the Capital One Cup win over Bolton on Wednesday but will be available for today’s clash with Paul Lambert’s third-placed Villa.

Costa returned from the last round of internationals with a hamstring problem in his left leg, but Vicente del Bosque, Spain’s coach, still intends to call him up for games against Slovakia and Luxembourg.

Mourinho said: ‘The moment a national team wants to select a Chelsea player, I’m nobody. It’s their decision. They can do what they want. It’s completely out of my control. What I think and what I feel doesn’t play a part. 

'Everyone is working hard. He (Costa) is the first to do that. He’s working hard in his recovery with the medical staff and the conditioning staff. Mentally, he’s ready for every game. Physically he’s not.

‘I’m nobody to make that decision. Everybody knows what is going on with Diego. Everyone knows he’s in trouble for quite a long time. But I’m nobody.

Jose Mourinho hopes star striker Diego Costa is not selected for Spain for their upcoming internationals 

‘We can communicate, send exams and reports, but it’s their decision. After the game against Arsenal, or even before that when they make the pre-selection, everything is in their hands. I can do nothing.’

Costa, who has scored seven times already in the Premier League since his move from Atletico Madrid, starts against Villa.

Mourinho fell out spectacularly with Lambert last season but claims he is now refusing to discuss other managers or players.

It appears the club, along with Mourinho, have made a policy decision to gag the manager after last season’s confrontations.

Mourinho said: ‘I respect every opponent’s manager and, when I play at home, it’s my duty to wait for them in the tunnel when they come at the same time as me.

‘If they come later or earlier, I go to their bench and shake their hands. Tomorrow will not be different.’
