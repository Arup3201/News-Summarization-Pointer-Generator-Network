A man died in front of his 10-year-old grandson when a tree he was clearing fell on to his neck.

Grandfather Arwel Thomas, 51, was clearing storm-damaged trees from a relative's house in Llanfachreth, near Dolgellau, North Wales with the boy.

Mr Thomas, a local councillor, was using a chainsaw when the trunk fell onto his neck trapping him underneath.
