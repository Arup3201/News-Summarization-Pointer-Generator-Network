A suicide bomber blew himself up outside a gate of the Afghan Defense Ministry in Kabul on Saturday shortly after U.S. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel arrived in the country on an official visit, according to Afghan officials.

At least nine civilians were killed and fourteen others wounded when a suicide attacker on a bicycle hit the main entrance to the defense ministry, officials said. Hagel was in a meeting at a U.S.-led military coalition facility in Kabul at the time of the blast and he was unharmed, a Pentagon spokesman said.

In a statement, the Afghan Taliban claimed responsibility for the
attack and said it was 'a kind of message' for Hagel.

Reporters traveling with Hagel were in a briefing when they heard the explosion, and were moved to a lower floor of the same building, according to the Associated Press. The blast was followed by the sound of heavy gunfire.

Hagel, who was confirmed as Pentagon chief last week, arrived in Afghanistan for his first official visit on Friday.

On the day of his arrival, three men wearing Afghan army uniforms 
and driving an army vehicle forced their way onto a U.S. base in eastern
Afghanistan and opened fire, killing a contractor and wounding U.S. 
troops.

'We are still at war,' Hagel said Friday, discussing the challenges ahead in drawing down U.S. troops in the country.

'That transition has to be done right, 
it has to be done in partnership with the Afghans, with our allies,' he said. 'Our country as well as Afghanistan, the region, and the 
allies have a lot at stake here. And our continued focus and energy and 
attention on Afghanistan is going to be very important.'

There are currently 66,000 U.S. military
personnel in the country, and that number is scheduled to be cut in 
half by early next year.

'Even as we move into more of a support role, this remains a dangerous 
and difficult mission,' Hagel said in a statement to U.S. forces, which was issued upon his arrival in the country. 'Many of you will continue to
experience the ugly reality of combat and the heat of battle.'

Hagel told reporters on a flight en route to Afghanistan that he wanted to go to the country to 'see where we are.'

'I need to better understand what's going on,' he said.
