Europe is losing its competitive edge and UK growth is too low, the boss of Britain’s biggest consumer goods firm warned yesterday.

Paul Polman, chief executive of Unilever, was also scathing about governments seeking to lower their debts by taxing companies.

He said: ‘If they are going to solve their desire to reduce their deficits by putting more charges on businesses they are going to make Europe less competitive – which is what’s happening in some countries in Europe right now.’

Concerns: Unilever boss Paul Polman has warned that Europe is losing its competitive edge and that the economy is growing too slowly

Mr Polman said he believed the UK was on the right track to recovery but growth at 0.6 per cent was too slow.

He added: ‘If Unilever put in 0.6 per cent growth the share price would be half what it is today.

‘No one is happy with the small growth in the UK because too many people are excluded from the workforce, and too many people see their standards of living not improving.’

Mr Polman heads one of the world’s biggest food groups, which makes household name products including Ben & Jerry’s ice cream, Marmite, Lipton tea and Flora margarine as well as Persil washing powder, Lynx deodorant and Domestos detergent.

He has in the past hit out at the EU’s approach to economics saying ‘complacency will kill’ if countries do not push for the kind of expansion seen in ‘tiger’ economies such as China and India.

While being a pro-European, he thinks not enough is being done to accelerate growth.

‘Wealth has become global and Europe has lost its relative competitiveness,’ he said.

‘We have become too expensive and we have lost productivity, investment in quality, education and R&D – those are the fundamentals.

There isn’t labour law flexibility and frankly we have not yet created a very efficient internal market.

‘The reality is the rest of the world is moving faster and Europe is losing its relative competitiveness.

'I meet very few bosses who say that their cost of doing business in Europe is lower than anywhere else.

‘The cost of doing business in Europe is becoming very expensive, so Europe needs to adjust.’

Mr Polman said Europe loses out by not operating as a single market or investing enough in education and research.

Unilever is Britain’s 18th biggest firm with a market value of £35billion.
