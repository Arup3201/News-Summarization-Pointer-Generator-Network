The streets of Harlem will smell a little sweeter today, but it's not because of some new bakery opening up.

The New York City Office of Emergency Management will be conducting upgrades on a natural gas pipeline

To keep residents from calling 911, they are replacing the usually rotten smell of mercaptan with a more friendly cinnamon scent.

Odorless: Natural gas doesn't have a smell so it's usually laced with mercaptan to make it easily detectable. Since residents have nothing to worry about with the gas released this morning, the city has changed the smell to cinnamon

Mercaptan is the rotten eggs smell that most people connote with natural gas.

In it's normal state, natural gas smells is odorless so mercaptan is added to it so humans can detect when there is a leak.

While gas will be released today, Office of Emergency spokesman Christopher Miller says residents in Harlem shouldn't worry when they smell the spicy scent.

'There's no danger. It is a masking agent used to cover the scent of mercaptan,' Miller said.

The upgrades will take place in Harlem around West 134th Street near the Hudson River for two hours, from 8:30 a.m. to 10:30 a.m.

Sweet smell of Harlem: The natural gas updates will be taking place near West 134th Street and the Hudson River between 8:30 a.m. and 10:30 a.m.

'This will be performed in an open environment and there are no health risks,' he said.
