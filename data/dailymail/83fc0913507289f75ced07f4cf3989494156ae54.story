Plans to protect seahorses in Dorset and around the Isle of Wight have been shelved so yachtsman can moor their boats 

Plans to protect seahorses and other sea life were shelved yesterday so yachtsmen can moor their boats.

Officials said establishing marine conservation zones in Dorset’s Studland Bay and around the Isle of Wight would have had major implications for sailors, including restrictions on where they could anchor.

The decision – by environment ministry Defra – was condemned by campaigners. Joan Edwards, of The Wildlife Trusts, said anchors break fragile eelgrass, which is the habitat of many underwater species.

There will now be a consultation exercise on the establishment of 23 conservation zones – 14 fewer than first planned.

Studland Bay is two miles from Sandbanks, Britain’s most expensive strip of coastal real estate. It is also the only place in the UK where both native seahorse species – the spiny seahorse and the short-snouted seahorse – are known to breed.

Close to Poole Harbour, the bay is the only place in the UK where both native seahorse species - the spiny seahorse and the short-snouted seahorse - are known to breed.

Numbers have fallen dramatically in recent years. In 2009 a survey recorded 40 spiny and two short-snouted seahorses in the bay, but last year researchers could only find a single juvenile male swimming there.

The eelgrass which grows in the bay is also home to endangered undulate rays, native British oysters and a huge variety of vulnerable fish and molluscs.

Joan Edwards, head of living seas at The Wildlife Trusts, told the Daily Mail: ‘People sail their yachts out of Poole Harbour and come to Studland for a gin and tonic.

‘The damage is done when they chuck their anchors over the side. It breaks the fragile eelgrass, which is the habitat for many, many species.’

In a report on the decision, Defra officials said locals had complained their businesses would be hit by restrictions to watersports.

They wrote: ‘The designation of the site is expected to impact on commercial fishing, local port and harbour activity and recreational boating activities, with high costs associated with the port and harbour sector and recreational boating.’ 

They said imposing such a zone on the area would cost the local economy £80,000.

But Mrs Edwards dismissed the costs, saying: ‘£80,000 would not buy a shed in that part of the country.’

A yachting ban would not needed, she said. Boats could instead tie up to floating buoys rather than dropping anchors which damage the sea bed.

Three more planned conservation zones were also shelved around the Isle of Wight because of similar impacts to yachting and recreation, which Defra estimated would cost the economy a combined £290,000.

Yachting associations have long denied they are part of the problem.

Jon Reid, spokesman for the Boat Owners’ Response Group, said in September: ‘Studland Bay has been used by generations of boat owners, going back the last 70 years and eelgrass has always been there.

‘Why is there suddenly an issue now? There is a huge body of evidence that states this type of eelgrass is very resilient and if damaged it puts on a growth spurt to recover.’

The 14 proposed conservation zones dropped by Defra also including four in the Irish Sea, where officials are concerned about the impact on commercial fishing, four off the Welsh coast which will be deferred to the regional authority, and two others for which they need more information. 

Each will be reconsidered in the next round of licences in 2016/17.

Just 27 marine conservation zones currently exist in English waters. Experts say 127 experts are needed.

Defra said the proposed 23 new sites would cover more than 3,800 square miles, protecting important seabed habitats and species.
