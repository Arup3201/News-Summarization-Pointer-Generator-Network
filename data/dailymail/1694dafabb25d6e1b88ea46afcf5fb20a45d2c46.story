Pivotal: Police officer Toby Rowland

The Mail on Sunday can today name the policeman at the centre of the ‘Plebgate’ row that cost former Government Chief Whip Andrew Mitchell his job.

As doubts grow about the allegations made against Mr Mitchell, we can identify Toby Rowland as the officer involved in the Downing Street fracas – and the man believed to have written the official log of the incident.

In the 442-word account, it is stated that Mr Mitchell called police ‘plebs’ when they stopped him from riding his bike through the Downing Street gates – an allegation the former Minister has always denied – and used language that left passers-by ‘visibly shocked’.

The claims led to a media storm and Mr Mitchell’s resignation. However CCTV footage of the incident, made public last week, cast serious doubt on the log’s version of events, and increased the pressure on David Cameron to return Mr Mitchell to frontline politics.

The video showed Mr Rowland, 42, ushering Mr Mitchell through the side gate of Downing Street – but no sign of a blazing row.

Scotland Yard is now investigating the possibility that Mr Mitchell has been the victim of a conspiracy among officers angered by government cuts.

And last night, as concern about the affair grew,  Met Commissioner Bernard Hogan-Howe broke off from his holiday to return to duty.

Mr Hogan-Howe, who has been criticised for his handling of the case, said he had returned to work  ‘because of his concern for the welfare of all the officers and their families involved in the events surrounding the incident’.

Last week it was claimed that another policeman sent an email to an MP, falsely claiming to be a member of the public who witnessed the row while passing Downing Street with his nephew. That officer, The Mail on Sunday can also disclose today, is 52-year-old Keith Wallis, who like Mr Rowland is a member of the Diplomatic Protection Group. Mr Wallis, from Ruislip, Middlesex, was arrested earlier this month on suspicion of misconduct in public office.

In a further development, this newspaper has been told that Mr Wallis – who denied being a witness to the original incident when confronted by Channel 4’s political editor Michael Crick last week – is related to a second man arrested over the affair, a 23-year-old.

Former chief whip Andrew Mitchell was accused of calling police officers 'plebs'

The man, who is not a member of police staff, was held last week on suspicion of ‘intentionally encouraging or assisting an offence of  misconduct in a public office’.

When approached by a Mail on Sunday reporter at his home near Aylesbury last week, shaven-headed Mr Rowland, who is married to another police officer, Rebecca,  declined to discuss his role in the incident, claiming not to ‘know  anything about it’.

As he washed his car outside his semi-detached village home near the Chilterns, he added: ‘I don’t know anything about that, mate. You will have to speak to Scotland Yard.’

When questioned on whether he had been 
asked not to talk by the police, he sighed and asked the reporter to 
leave. Later that day, Mr Rowland was visited by two police officers, 
though it was not clear if they formally questioned him. Afterwards one 
of the officers said: ‘They are not prepared to talk. They are not 
prepared to make any statements.’

Mr Rowland is due to be asked about the apparent discrepancies in the official log – along with a female police officer who was also in Downing Street at the time. Mr Mitchell’s supporters have called for the two officers to be suspended during the investigation, but Scotland Yard say they remain on duty.

Police have suggested that 30 officers are examining whether there was a conspiracy to smear Mr Mitchell and are conducting ‘a large scale and complex investigation’. One thing it will try to determine is why the log and the email contained such similar accounts of the September 19 incident.

Downing Street beat: Mr Rowland is thought to have written the log about Mr Mitchell

Last night leading Tory MP David Davis, who has played a prominent role trying to clear Mr Mitchell’s name, called for the former Chief Whip to be restored to the Cabinet in his previous job as International Development Secretary.

‘I think that Mr Mitchell should return to the Cabinet at the earliest opportunity,’ Mr Davis said.

‘His honour and reputation is clearly fully restored. He has shown tremendous courage to recover from the way he was completely shredded over these false allegations. I see no reason why he should not be given back his old job as International Development Secretary, where his work won widespread praise at home and abroad.’

But Downing Street contested the suggestion that Mr Cameron should have kept Mr Mitchell in his job, releasing a statement which insisted that the Prime Minister backed his colleague for as long as he could.

A spokesman said: ‘The Prime Minister has deep sympathy for Andrew Mitchell after allegations emerged that a serving police officer fabricated evidence against him. The Prime Minister stood behind his Chief Whip through weeks of growing demands to sack him. It was only when it became clear that he could no longer do his job that his resignation was accepted with reluctance.

‘Andrew Mitchell did not disagree with the Prime Minister’s approach throughout this period. The Prime Minister, and Andrew Mitchell, were deeply shocked to be informed that the police were investigating allegations that a serving police officer had lied about the events.’

The CCTV footage of the incident further stoked the already rancorous dispute between the Tories and Scotland Yard by appearing to show that there were no ‘shocked’ members of the public.

The Police Federation vigorously pursued the claims against Mr Mitchell, with some branches of the employees’ body organising protests where officers wore ‘PC Pleb’ T-shirts. Its chairman Paul McKeever said he would apologies to Mr Mitchell if it was proved that he did not call police officers ‘plebs’.

Mr McKeever has acknowledged concerns that the federation ‘stoked up’ the Downing Street incident.

He  has handed control of the federation to his successor-elect Steve Williams a month before he is officially due to leave the role, due to ‘pre-existing leave arrangements’.

And one of Mr Williams’s first acts was to announce plans for a review prompted by the Mitchell incident.

‘Recent events have shown that there are issues around the way the federation nationally is able to lead and co-ordinate,’ he said in a statement. ‘My first act as chairman is to establish this independent panel to ensure that we continue to represent the interests of our members in the most effective and efficient way.’

Mr Hogan-Howe, who has publicly backed the officers involved, now faces a grilling by MPs over the handling of the affair. Mr Mitchell was reported to have doubts over the Met chief’s impartiality after he said the original log was not contradicted by the CCTV footage.

Keith Vaz, chairman of the Home Affairs Select Committee, said: ‘There are serious questions that need answering.’

Asked about Mr Hogan-Howe’s position, Scotland Yard said its investigation into the affair ‘is progressing with urgency, whilst maintaining an open mind and a determination to leave no stone unturned’.

A spokesman declined to respond to questions about Mr Rowland’s involvement in the row. He also declined to confirm that Mr Wallis was the officer arrested.

Sir Hugh Orde, president of the Association of Chief Police Officers, yesterday insisted this was an isolated case. He said: ‘There’s always been – and there should be – a healthy tension between politicians and the police service I don’t think this is evidence of a growing distrust.’
