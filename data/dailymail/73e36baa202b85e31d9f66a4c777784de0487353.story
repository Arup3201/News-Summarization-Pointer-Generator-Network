Fourteen former MPs given huge payoffs when they were kicked out by voters at the last General Election have been selected to stand again in May.

The 12 Labour and two Liberal Democrat MPs were each given 'golden goodbyes' worth up to £55,000 when they lost their seats in 2010.

Between them they were handed a total of £650,898.

Miss Keeble was criticised during the expenses scandal for claiming £4,112 for windows under the second home allowance, £3,072 for a new boiler and £950 for 'essential maintenance' on her bathroom. Andrew Dismore received a payout of £54,403 after leaving the Commons

But just five years after they were handed the 'resettlement grants', the former MPs are trying to get their old jobs back.

All have been reselected by their parties in the same seats they contested five years ago. Many of the so-called 'retreads' were kicked out after finding themselves embroiled in the expenses scandal.

In addition, Alex Salmond, who stood down as an MP in 2010 and received a £65,000 payout, is standing again for Westminster after resigning last year as Scottish first minister and leader of the Scottish National Party. 

After tax, Mr Salmond received about £50,000 and donated half to a charity named after his late mother.

Andy Silvester, of the Taxpayers' Alliance, said: 'These payments were totally excessive. It makes sense to provide winding-up expenses, but nobody should expect politics to be a job for life. It will be for voters to decide whether they want to reselect MPs embroiled in the expenses scandal.'

Among those who received a payout is Sally Keeble, who was the MP for Northampton North for 13 years from 1997 until 2010. 

She was entitled to a resettlement grant of £54,403. Miss Keeble was criticised during the expenses scandal for claiming £4,112 for windows under the second home allowance, £3,072 for a new boiler and £950 for 'essential maintenance' on her bathroom.

Ex-Labour MPs Patrick Hall, Nick Palmer and David Drew are all trying to make a Commons comeback 

Lib Dem Julia Goldsworthy, and Labour's Joan Ryan and Dawn Butler want to win back their seats in Parliament

John Grogan, Mike O'Brien and Rob Marris want to return to the Commons five years after they left

Lib Dem Richard Younger-Ross lost his seat in 2010, when Labour's Bob Blizzard and Paul Clarke also left

Joan Ryan, Labour MP for Enfield North from 1997 until 2010, received a payoff of £50,517. During the expenses scandal she was ordered to repay some £5,000 in mortgage interest which she had 'overclaimed'. 

She had also claimed more than £4,500 for work on her home, including fence repairs, cleaning the back garden and redecorating her living room.

Last night the expenses watchdog, the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority, said it is powerless to recover any payments if MPs are re-elected.

After the last election a total of £10.4million was paid in resettlement grants to 220 MPs, but the system was deemed so lavish that payments have been slashed for any who are kicked out in May.

An analysis of the Tory party's list of prospective parliamentary candidates suggests that none of them was previously an MP.

A Labour spokesman said last night: 'Under rules drawn up independently by House of Commons authorities, MPs of all parties are entitled to these grants when they lose their seats.

'It is not unusual for former MPs to seek re-election – indeed, there are 14 current Conservative MPs who previously lost their seats.'
