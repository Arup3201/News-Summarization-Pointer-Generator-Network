A clever mom in Boston, Massachusetts is giving people a behind-the-scenes look at her stay-at-home job with a heartwarming time-lapse video documenting her day.

Kristin DeLano has two sons and a daughter who are all under five years old; each child has different needs, different schedules and different likes and dislikes. In her video, Mrs DeLano shows all these variables as well as her maternal ability to balance them every day.

'We never see what happens behind other family's closed doors, so I thought it would be fun to give everyone a peek into ours,' Mrs DeLano told Huffington Post.

A well-fed family: The video shows Kristin, her two sons and her baby daughter through their entire day's routine, from breakfast all the way until bedtime

'My entire day (almost) time lapsed in six minutes,' she explains in the YouTube video description. 'There it is. Minus about an hour or so. Started right after breakfast. Took a few phone calls, and didn't have it going right away when daddy came home, but that's it!' 

Despite Mrs DeLano remaining at home throughout the entire day, her video clearly demonstrates just how varied and challenging her role as a mother is; throughout the course of just one single day, she takes on the role of entertainer, nurse, teacher and parent all at once. 

In the video Mrs DeLano is seen preparing meals, changing diapers, arranging crafts and even treating a nosebleed. 

Part of being a mom: Kristin helps the boys through their playtime, teaching along the way, and when one comes down with a nosebleed, she comes to the resue with a roll of toilet paper

The end of another long day: Kristin climbs into  bed with all of her brood to read them a book before they turn off the lights for bed

 As exhausting as it seems, the video doesn't even show a lot of her daily labors and household duties, which she takes the opportunity to complete while the kids are busy.

'I didn't think anyone would want to see me doing dishes, or laundry, so I left [the camera] on the kids in the living room,' she explains. 'That's why I'll disappear for short periods of time. Or I'm hiding in a closet eating chocolate... you be the judge.'

As impressive as her mothering is, Mrs DeLano is quick to credit her loving husband, who makes the odd cameo from the side of the screen in the video. 

They're a handful: The Boston mom shows how she has mastered the art of motherly multitasking with the six-minute video

Aside from his own day job, he also looks after most of the cooking, plays Legos with the boys and reads his fair share of bedtime stories.

'He always worries he's not doing enough,' Mrs Delano told the Huffington Post. 'But I can see it in their eyes how much he's loved by them.'

Since sharing the video DeLano has been inundated with supportive messages from other parents, saying that she has inspired them to 'to step away from their daily distractions, and get down on the floor and play with their kids'.
