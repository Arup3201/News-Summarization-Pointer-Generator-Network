A man was executed on Wednesday for the murder of a guard during a botched 1987 prison van ambush intended to free an imprisoned friend.

William Van Poyck, 58, of Florida, was pronounced dead at 7.24 pm, 23 minutes after the injection process began at the State Prison.

'Set me free,' were his final words.

Van Poyck declined a final meal and was visited on Wednesday by his sister, four friends and a spiritual adviser.

Van Poyck's case garnered international attention because he published three books and maintained a blog while on death row. He even wrote recently about his pending execution.

The family of the slain guard, Fred Griffis, has said in interviews that they were frustrated that news stories focused on Van Poyck, the crime and his writings - and not Griffis.

Van Poyck and accomplice Frank Valdes ambushed a prison van outside a West Palm Beach doctor's office in a failed attempt to free James O'Brien - with whom they'd served time.

Griffis was fatally shot after he threw the van's keys into the bushes to foil the escape. Van Poyck and Valdes were captured following a car chase.

In his appeals, Van Poyck argued that 
Valdes fired the fatal shots and that if the jury had known that, he 
wouldn't have been sentenced to death.

The Florida Supreme Court last week rejected Van Poyck's latest appeal involving Valdes' widow, who says her husband told her he was the shooter.

The justices noted that Van Poyck planned the escape attempt and that he and Valdes carried loaded weapons.

In 1999, Valdes was stomped to death in prison. Seven guards were charged with his death, but none were convicted.

Following Valdes' death, Van Poyck was moved to Sussex State Prison in Virginia for his safety.

That's where he wrote a 324-page autobiography, A Checkered Past: A Memoir, saying his purpose was not to elicit sympathy but 'to put a human face on me and convicts in general'.

Van Poyck went on to write two novels. He won awards for his writing and kept a blog since 2005 by writing letters to his sister Lisa Van Poyck, who posted them online.

'He is deeply remorseful for the ending of Fred Griffis' life,' Lisa Van Poyck told The Associated Press on Tuesday.

'He is guilty of a crime of trying to break somebody out of a prison transport van - he had no intention of hurting anyone.'
