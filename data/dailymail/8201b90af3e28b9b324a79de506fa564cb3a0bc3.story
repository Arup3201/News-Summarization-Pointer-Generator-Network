Identical twins Andrew and Christopher Watson shared an extraordinary intuition. Throughout their schooldays, their interests and talents were as indistinguishable as their looks.

So when, tragically, Christopher was left trapped in a vegetative state after a horrific car accident when the boys were just 16, Andrew knew that as his twin, he was  the right person to speak on his brother’s behalf.

And in 2009, three years after the crash, it was Andrew who made the heart-wrenching decision to end his brother’s life.

After the accident in 2006 Chris initially still had some brain activity and would respond to simple commands

With the full support of his mother 
Helen and older sister Emma, Andrew went to the High Court seeking 
permission to withdraw Christopher’s nutrition and hydration. Two years 
later, after tests were completed, the court agreed and on December 7, 
2010, Christopher died peacefully in a hospice.

It is only now that Andrew, 23, feels able to talk about what happened and his role in the decision.

‘Every
time I saw Chris, it was like looking at a mirror image of myself,’ he 
says. ‘It was like watching  myself die. But if it had been me lying 
there, I’d have wanted him to do the same. 

‘I feel very empty without him. As 
though I have lost a part of myself. But the extraordinary thing is the 
moment he died, without realising it, I seem to have taken on his 
mannerisms.

'Apparently I now walk, cough and laugh just like him. I have told Mum I shall now have to live for the both of us.’

Andrew
and Christopher, from Lutterworth in Leicestershire, were boarders at 
Kingham Hill School in the Cotswolds at the time of the accident.

They
had spent the weekend with family friends nearby. Their parents – 
Peter, an accountant, and Helen – were divorcing and it was a difficult 
time.

Alastair Godfrey, 19,
the son of the family friend, offered to drive the twins and another 
schoolfriend, Hannah Jenkins, back to school on the Sunday evening of 
April 30. 

Christopher and 
Andrew piled into the back of Alastair’s Renault Clio.  Hannah sat in 
the front. Andrew put on his seatbelt, Christopher did not.  ‘Alastair 
drove along the narrow country roads and into the school grounds,’ 
Andrew recalls, ‘but we went over a hill too quickly and smashed into a 
4x4 driven by one of the school’s groundkeepers.

‘I remember spinning around in the car and was then unconscious for a few minutes.

‘When I came around, I decided to get help from school and as I wandered down the road, I saw Chris lying curled up about 15 yards from the car. He was breathing but it was very shallow.

‘I was in such a state of shock, I initially couldn’t work out why he was there. It was only later I heard he had been thrown out of the car.  

‘He and Alastair, who tragically died that night, were quickly taken away by ambulance.

‘Another ambulance took Hannah – who fortunately wasn’t too badly hurt – and me to Gloucestershire Royal Hospital.

'I had some internal bruising. Chris was taken to Frenchay Hospital in Bristol. After a week, Mum told me that he wasn’t in good shape so I went to see him.’

Andrew pauses and looks down at his hands in his lap. ‘I couldn’t stay with him for more than five minutes on that first occasion.

‘I don’t think anyone can understand what it is like seeing your identical twin like that because it looks as if it is you.

‘He had two massive black eyes, his head was shaved and there were tubes attached to him everywhere. It could so easily have been me, if I hadn’t put my seatbelt on, and I felt knocked off my feet for a long time. I sat and cried in the hospital waiting room.

‘It was also so heartbreaking to realise that something like this could happen in a blink of an eye.

‘One minute we were having a laugh on the way back to school and the next...

‘I gradually got more used to seeing him and on regular occasions while he was in an induced coma, I would hold his hand and talk to him and the nurses would tell me his blood pressure went down and he seemed more relaxed. That helped relax me. 

‘I stayed at boarding school, but thought about him all the time. Because of our telepathic connection, when I couldn’t sleep or felt very agitated, I knew something was wrong.

'I would then phone Mum to ask about him and it usually turned out that he had had an epileptic fit. It was the weirdest experience.

'Chris still had some brain activity initially and would respond to simple commands, but sometimes when I thought I’d seen something, the nurses said they hadn’t.’

Shortly afterwards, Christopher was operated on for a ruptured stomach and from then on tests recorded zero brain activity.

As well as developing epilepsy, Christopher had several strokes. His immune system shut down and he suffered from meningitis, MRSA and chest and urinary infections.

In 2008, Andrew, his mother and sister met doctors and they mentioned that withdrawing feeding was an option. Andrew felt positive about the idea.

‘It was heart-wrenching to watch Chris’s physical deterioration. He had no dignity and could not communicate, which is no way for anybody to live,’ says Andrew.

‘Mum signed a “Do not resuscitate” order and we took the decision as a family to withdraw feeding and let nature take its course. I had to force myself not to focus on the emotional side, as I didn’t want Chris to feel any of that when I went to see him.  

‘I believed strongly that as Chris couldn’t make the decision for himself, I had to think for him. When you see someone who could do everything become completely helpless, you know it is no way to live.’  

The court agreed in November 2010 that feeding could be withdrawn but the family then ran into another problem. 

‘The lady who ran the care home in Leicester where Chris spent three years said she didn’t think it was the right thing to do and wouldn’t allow it to happen there. So we had to find a hospice to move him to. 

‘At the hospice, he survived for ten days and died early on December 7. Mum went into his room first and I caught a glimpse of him through the door. It made me feel I had been hit by a giant stone.

‘But I told myself I had to go in. I said a final goodbye and a final  “I love you” then left in disbelief – because I had lost the most important person in my life.’
