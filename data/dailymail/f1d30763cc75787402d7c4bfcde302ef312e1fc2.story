The film, which will be shot in Las Vegas and Philadelphia, will chronicle the boxing career of Apollo Creed’s grandson Adonis, who will be played by Michael B. Jordan.

Adonis’ family are relucant to see him in the ring but he is set to be mentored by Balboa.

Speaking after his victory over Nathan Cleverly last month, a coy Bellew said: ‘I’m going to Hollywood in December for an assignment. I’ve been sought-after for a long time. I hope it’s a speaking part because no-one wants to look at this face if I’m not talking. My life’s going to change.

‘I’ve had the contracts sitting in front of me for weeks because I wasn’t signing them. If this fight had gone wrong I wasn’t signing, I was going home to be depressed.

‘I can’t go into the details but let’s just say it’s big. It will be 40-odd days of filming, I just hope I can do it.’
