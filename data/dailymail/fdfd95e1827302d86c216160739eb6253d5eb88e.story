A 32-year-old man has become so overweight that doctors have warned he could be dead within three years if he doesn't change his lifestyle.

At his heaviest, Martyn Richardson weighed 26 stone after a lifetime of being overweight.

His huge frame means he now suffers from crippling arthritis in his knees - meaning exercising in order to lose weight is virtually impossible.

He is now stuck in a vicious cycle where steroid pain relief causes him to gain weight - compounding the problem further.

But if he doesn't lose half his body weight, his future is extremely bleak.

Martyn features in a new series of Channel 5's Big Body Squad, which follows the lives of those
 who are so large they cannot carry out everyday tasks, as well as the 
expert help they draft in.

For the first time in history, obesity is killing more people than malnutrition.

Around 15 million Britons are obese and it is estimated that this will cost the UK a staggering £27 billion by 2016.

At just 32 years of age and now weighing 22 stone, Martyn's body has virtually given up on him. Viewers follow him as he meets experts who will try and help him get thin - and get his life back on track.

Martyn's osteoarthritis is a prime example of how being overweight can drastically age the body. With the joints of a 60-year-old, he struggles to walk and exercise is excruciatingly painful.

He tells the programme: 'My consultant told me if I continued as I was, then I'd be dead within three years.

'Like lots of young people, I thought my weight gain was a phase and I'd sort it out later in life. I started gaining weight in my teens and it went up each year.

'I kept thinking I'll lose it, but it just carried on. I was never really active and ate a lot of takeaways.

'It got to the point where my doctor said something needed to be done - or I'd die.'

Faced with this stark choice, Martyn desperately began to lose some weight - and has so far managed 4st.

But he soon found himself in agony. 'The longer I walk, the more it feels like I'm dragging a dead lead weight around.

'I need to exercise to lose weight, but the more I do, the more painful my knee joints become.

The programme also features other obese people receiving the services of the Big Body Squad, such as 30st Steve Wilson, involved in a car crash.  Britain's emergency services are increasingly called upon to deal with larger and larger casualties

'Steroid injections to relieve the pain make me gain weight - putting more pressure on my knees - and causing me more pain.'

Desperate to find a solution, Martyn visits Dr Jane Schindler, a musculo-skeletal expert based in Wakefield, West Yorkshire.

She gives him acupuncture to try and break the cycle of weight gain and pain - before his joints age any further.

If successful, the acupuncture will relieve his need for painkillers.

Despite his phobia of needles, Martyn has the treatment, which involves needles being inserted into pressure points near the sore and damaged affected areas.

Dr Schindler explains that although acupuncture is proven to relive pain, how it does this is still a mystery.

She explains: 'I am for trigger points in the muscle to try and relax it - and it seems to help with mobility and pain relief.'

The treatment should also strengthen muscles around the area, so they are less painful.

With obesity soaring, her services are in demand - and at £45 a session, they are cheaper than many services provided to patients such as Martyn.

Britain’s emergency services are increasingly called upon to deal with larger and larger casualties, as overweight people find themselves in need of urgent help. 

This week, when 30-stone Steve crashes his car, the fire service struggles to cope with the extra challenges that come with his size and weight. As they attempt to get him out, the crew are forced to reduce his car to scrap metal.

The series features a secret and steadily growing number of Britons that live as prisoners in their own home.

Denise weighs 40stone and is confined to bed, but  wants to get out of her room for the first time in four years.

But despite a supersized kit and a team of helpers, will she make it those few feet to freedom?

Bigger Big Body Squad begins on Wednesday January 8th on Channel 5 at 8pm.
