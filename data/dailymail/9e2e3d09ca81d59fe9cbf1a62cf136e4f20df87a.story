This is the massive Mexican, red rump tarantula discovered wandering around a football pitch in Maesteg, South Wales by a concerned member of the public.

Bridgend council, which is now trying to track down the tarantula's owner, was alerted after the spider - which is not generally harmful to humans - was spotted by a passer-by at local Garth Park ball court.

Local authority worker Dave Edwards scooped the arachnid up into a black bag before calling wildlife expert and TV personality Dr Rhys Jones, from Cardiff University, for advice.

Dr Jones, best known as the star of the BBC One series Rhys Jones's Wildlife Patrol, said: 'It is unlikely that the spider would have travelled from distance, given the cold spring temperatures and the proximity of local houses.

'The surrounding habitat offered little interest or cover for that species of spider, given that it mainly consists of large open fields which are patrolled by many aerial predators, including gulls and crows.

'These birds would have easily spotted this tropical spider and, given half a chance, would have eaten her.

'All things considered, the spider had a very lucky escape before a bird or cat killed it.'

The Mexican red rump, or B. vagans in Latin, was made famous in Jack Arnold's 1955 sci-fi movie Tarantula, where an ill-advised scientific experiment leads to a giant arachnid breaking out of captivity and terrorizing the Arizona desert.

Luckily for the population of Bridgend County Borough, however, the creature is not aggressive, and is currently being looked after by Dr Jones at Cardiff University.

'The red rump tarantula does not present a significant health risk to the general public. In the rare case of the spider biting, the symptoms would be similar to that of a mild bee sting.

'I'm happy to report that no one was unnecessarily frightened by the appearance of this spider on the loose.

'While the spider is now secure and recovering from its ordeal, anyone with nformation relating to this incident should either contact the local authority or the police on 101.'

Councillor Phil White, Cabinet Member for Communities, added: 'It's not every day that you spot an exotic pet such as this outside of its home environment, so we are appealing for the owner to get in touch as soon as possible.
