Mario Gomez has poured cold water over suggestions he could join Barcelona in the summer by insisting he is content with life at Fiorentina.

German ace Gomez has been linked with a move to the Nou Camp, however the 29-year-old insists even the lure of playing alongside the likes of Lionel Messi and Neymar could not tempt him away from the Stadio Artemio Franchi.

Gomez, who has scored four league goals so far this season, told Rai Sport: 'I'm in the sights of Barcelona? The rumours do not interest me, I want to stay in Florence.

Gomez, pictured against Tottenham, left Bayern Munich to join Fiorentina for over £17million in July 2013

'I came Fiorentina to win, I have a goal that I have not yet reached.'

The striker joined Fiorentina in July 2013 for a fee believed to be in the region of £17.2million.

Gomez played for Stuttgart and Bayern Munich before leaving his homeland to seal a move to the Viola.
