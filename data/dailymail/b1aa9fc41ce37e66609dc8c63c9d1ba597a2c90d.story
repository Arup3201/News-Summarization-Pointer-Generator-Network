Host commentator

Thanks for tuning into our coverage today!

West Ham United have the win they wanted.

It wasn't pretty but Sakho really saw them through and they have another three points.

QPR meanwhile remain rooted to the bottom of the table and were totally outplayed.

Karl Herny sees yellow for pulling back Cresswell.

Kevin Nolan normally buries them but he hits it straight at Rob Green.

Downing gets past Onuoha and he pulls it back for Nolan on the penalty spot who side-foots it straight at the keeper.

Taarabt puts the ball past Cresswell and the defender decides to trip him up.

Clever at this stage of the game.

Jordan Mutch is capable of scoring the spectacular and he smashes one from 25 yards out which dips just before Adrian.

The goalkeeper is able to collect it though.

Taarabt is frustrating but he can do brilliant things from time to time.

The midfielder skips between the West Ham midfield and runs at the defence before unleashing a shot which swerves wide of the right-hand post.

Tomkins, who has possibly been West Ham's best player today, rises highest from a corner to nod the ball straight into Green's hands.

The only side who look like scoring here are West Ham...

The midfielder curls the ball around the wall but Adrian is equal to it and palms it away.

QPR need a goal - and soon!

West Ham are in total cruise control and the spark that was in QPR at the start of the second half is completely gone.

Tomkins has been comfortable at the back for West Ham and both Zamora and Austin need to challenge him more.

Valencia has it in the net but the referee disallows it.

Rob Green had put the ball down to take a free-kick and he passed it straight to Valencia but the striker was not 10 yards away.

Bizarre incident.

Sakho now have five goals in just five starts for West Ham and that is a real blow to QPR.

Tomkins tries to shoot from a tight angle and ends up looping the ball over the defence and to the back post where Sakho just nods it home from a yard.

Huge goal for West Ham.

Leroy Fer decides he is going to have a go from distance and he tries to launch one from the middle of pitch.

Unfortunately his volley is blocked only yards in front of him and QPR still do not have the breakthrough.

Zamora has given QPR a lot more shape.

They are getting into the game now and Kranjcar is becoming more and more involved.

West Ham on the other hand cannot get their foot on the ball for long at the moment.

Again Zamora causes problems and he is breaking past Tomkins so the West Ham man brings him down and is booked.

That is far better from QPR.

Straight away the substitute Zamora gets involved and breaks down the left.

He centres the ball for Austin who gets a foot on the ball but it goes past the post. Much, much better.

It certainly hasn't been a classic, but West Ham look extremely comfortable.

Since taking the lead after five minutes they haven't really felt the need to put their foot on the has.

QPR simply haven't put their foot on anything yet. They have been very poor and you would expect changes soon.

Austin is running his hart out up top but there is simply no support.

Sandro has been tidy in midfield but isn't exactly setting the world alight and Kranjcar is being prevented from influencing the match.

Alex Song controlling things.

Valencia is down with a slight knee injury.

They really have not got going at all here QPR and they keep just lumping it forward.

Apart from Austin's chance, their only real positive is that they have only conceded the one...

Hoilett has been completely anonynmous.

Valencia makes a wonderful run in behind the QPR defence and he wants the ball played to him from Zarate.

The ball is delayed slightly though and the Ecuadorian is caught offside.

Warning signs for QPR though.

QPR really are struggling. They just keep shooting themselves in the foot.

Valencia makes himself a nuisance and he makes sure to get his body between the ball and Sandro, who alongside Caulker takes three attempts to get rid of what should have been a fairly routine defensive clearance.

Everything that West Ham have done well has come through Stewart Downing.

He is enjoying his role behind the front players and is spreading the play beautifully with some long-range passes.

Sakho's headed flies just wide meanwhile when he should score.

Charlie Austin does brilliantly to slot the ball through Tomkin's legs and he finds himself through on goal to the left-hand side.

Instead of squaring to Kranjcar, he takes the shot on himself but can only lash it straight at Adrian.

Zarate seems to be carrying a knock now for West Ham.

Bobby Zamora, who scored the goal to get West Ham promoted, is applauded as he comes on to warm up for QPR.

I'm afraid apart from West Ham kicking the ball out for a goal kick when they had a good attacking opportunity, that's about all there is to report...

QPR are getting frustrated in attack because there simply isn't enough cohesion and communication between the attacking players.

There is a huge gap and Austin is so isolated.

Sakho is breaking into space because QPR are stretched so Sandro takes one for the team and takes him out.

Card comes out.

First of all Leroy Fer finds himself offside for QPR then Downing for West Ham.

A lot of sloppy play from both sides, but particularly the visitors.

Downing is being positive with everything he does.

He sends Sakho down the left whose cross deflects behind Valencia and he smashes it just wide.

QPR had a good three minutes and have been awful since...

Harry Redknapp needs to find something from his players.

West Ham look dangerous every time they go forward, however, particularly through Downing.

Rob Green is adamant there is a hand ball here but West Ham are ahead.

Downing whips in the corner and QPR simply do not defend it.

Sakho just sticks out a leg and it may even have been an Onuoha own goal.

Queens Park Rangers have the first meaningful attack and Charlie Austin is fouled in the centre of the park.

We're almost ready for the fourth Premier League game of the day. Five minutes until kick-off after the delay at Stamford Bridge. 

QPR haven't won at Upton Park for 21 years! The breezed past the hosts 4-0 that day with two goals from Les Ferdinand sandwiched by Gavin Peacock and Gary Penrice strikes. 

Out they come, led by Stewart Downing. 

QPR team to face West Ham: Green, Onuoha, Ferdinand, Caulker, Traore, Sandro, Henry, Fer, Hoilett, Kranjcar, Austin

West Ham team to face QPR: Adrian, Jenkinson, Tomkins, Reid, Cresswell, Song, Amalfitano, Downing, Zarate, Sakho, Valencia

And the football just keeps on coming today! Next it's West Ham against QPR at Upton Park. Team news is on its way... 

CLICK HERE for Martha Kelner's match report. 

West Ham United host Queens Park Rangers in a massive bottom-of-the-table clash at Upton Park.

This London derby is given extra spice due to Harry Redknapp's QPR returning to his old stomping ground at the Hammers sitting bottom of the table, with just four points from six games.

Sam Allardyce's West Ham United, meanwhile, have enjoyed a mixed start to the season.

They sit 16th in the table, three points better off than QPR, but having lost their previous match 2-1 against Manchester United at Old Trafford.
