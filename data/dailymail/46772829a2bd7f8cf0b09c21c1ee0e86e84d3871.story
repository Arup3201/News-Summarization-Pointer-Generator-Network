Paris Saint-Germain superstar Zlatan Ibrahimovic refused to be drawn on whether the club will be busy in this month's transfer market.

The oil-rich French side are thought to be interested in Newcastle midfielder Moussa Sissoko while Ezequiel Lavezzi, Adrien Rabiot and Edinson Cavani are all growing unsettle at the club.

But Ibrahimovic, who has a close relationship with the club's Qatari owners, claimed to know nothing of PSG's plans when asked.

Argentine forward Ezequiel Lavezzi was also disciplined for missing the session

An Instagram question put to him read: 'The transfer window is open again and rumors are circulating. Do you think there will be any changes on the PSG squad?'

To which the Swedish striker, 33, replied: 'That is a question for the club.'

Newcastle are willing to listen to offers for France international Sissoko.

Meanwhile, winger Lavezzi and midfielder Rabiot are frustrated at a lack of first-team football and Cavani is not happy at playing wide to accommodate Ibrahimovic.

All three have several clubs monitoring their situations.
