'I’m really excited to be launching my first ever fashion collection,' said Chloe of her latest venture.

This isn't Chloe's first venture into fashion; in January she launched her own range of bikinis with Bahimi

Speaking to MailOnline last month, Chloe's sister Lauryn hinted that Chloe would be unveiling a fashion range: 'I think Chloe would like to do her own fashion range, possibly in the summer, because she always puts cute outfits together.

'People have been paying a lot of interest to her clothes and make-up since she's been in the house so maybe she will do both!'. 

This isn't Chloe's first venture into fashion; in January she launched her own range of bikinis with Bahimi. 

The seven-piece range consisted of stylish and bold designs named after Chloe's favourite drinks, all modelled by Miss Goodman herself, of course. She was also unveiled as the face of Love Honey lingerie last month.
