Heartbreaking letters sent by grieving families pining for information about their sons who were killed during the First World War have been unveiled. 

Army Captain Evan Silk had the grim task of writing to families from the trenches to say their boys had died fighting on the front line.

He was not prepared for the response he would receive.

Treasured: These are just a few of the hundreds of letters Captain Silk received from grieving families after he informed them their son, brother or grandson had died on the front line during the First World War

Hundreds of devastated relatives responded with letters thanking him, asking how they died, and wanting to know where they were buried.

Many, he could not answer. But he cherished them for the rest of his life. 

One letter sent by soldier's mother Annie David, from Cardiff, said: 'You do not know how hungry I am for every scrap of information about my precious lad.

'Thank you so much for sending me the very nice pen ink sketch of my dear son's grave... I am writing for my husband who is still too ill to be told of our loss.

'It is very kind of you to say you will come and see me when you come home - it will be such a very great pleasure to see you.'

The letters remained in Capt Silk's wooden Army trunk for the past 100 years - and are now kept safe by his son, former clerk to the House of Commons, Paul Silk.

Incredible experience: Capt Silk (pictured left during the war) wrote as many details as he could for families, including sketches of their graves, and received hundreds of thank you letters in return (such as this one, right)

Mr Silk, 62, of Crickhowell, Powys, said he knew the letters were important to his father because he kept them safe for so long.

He said: 'My father was a young officer writing to soldiers' families who were killed. I don't have the letters he sent out but I do have some of the replies which he received.

'I think: 'Why did my father keep these?' and it must be because he was moved by them. You don't throw things away that are important to you.

'It must have affected him and because of that it affects me. They are quite poignant.'

Evan Silk left his home in the small town of Blaina, South Wales, at the age of 25 and was commissioned into the Welsh Regiment as one of the Artists Rifles in 1916 and swiftly rose to the rank of Captain.

He witnessed first-hand the horrors of the trenches, went over the top numerous times and fought in the third battle of Ypres.

As an adjutant he was responsible for the Welsh Regiment's administrative work - which included answering letters sent by the soldiers' families and writing to break the news of their deaths.

One letter tells of a family's concern about not hearing from a Lieutenant James.

It reads: 'I am sorry to trouble you in this time of stress and strenuous fighting, but could you possibly let me know anything of Lieut. E James of your glorious regiment.

'I have not heard from him for several months and I am anxious about him. Just a field card saying he is well etc. will put my mind at ease.'

But the soldier in question had been killed in action three months earlier.

Other letters speak of the confusion faced by those waiting at home and knowing little of the horror in the trenches.

One poignant message asked Capt Silk to put his trust in God to bring him home safe.

It said: 'Dear Evan, God will watch over you only ask him, for he has said if we call on him in the day of trouble he will deliver us so put all your trust in him in all things and he will bring you out safe.'

Lots of messages thanked Capt Silk for his kind words when writing to them at such a difficult time.

Mr Silk said although he has notes and letters from the war his father rarely talked about his experiences.

But he said the messages bring the conflict home to him because of his personal connection.

He said: 'I can recognise his handwriting on some of the letters, it brings it that much closer to me. But it's also an alien world, the world of 100 years ago.'
