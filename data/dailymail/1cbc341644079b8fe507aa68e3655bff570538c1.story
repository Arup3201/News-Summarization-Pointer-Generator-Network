He is unflinching in describing autopsies in his bestselling crime novels.  So it’s a surprise that Peter James is squeamish.

But the creator of the Detective Superintendent Roy Grace series – who has attended real-life dissections for research – says his own operation for carpal tunnel syndrome was ‘stomach-churning’.

The ten-minute surgery, carried out under local anaesthetic, was, however, life-changing for the 65-year-old, who had struggled in agony through book signings on international publicity tours.

Hand horror: Author Peter James couldn't bear to watch his carpal tunnel operation - but is typing at full speed again

When diagnosed with type 2 diabetes a few years ago, Peter had upped his fitness regime, running two to five miles every day.

But that stopped last May when his other passion, racing cars, resulted in a nasty accident which doctors believe may have triggered carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS), a common condition that causes pain, numbness, tingling and a dull ache in the hand, fingers and arm.

‘I rolled my race car at Brands Hatch and bust three ribs,’ he says. ‘Initially my left leg was in pain and then my right leg, with pain running down my fingertips into the right hand where I’d wrenched at the steering wheel. I didn’t know then but I had popped some discs in my back too.

‘It was only two days later when friends began to say “we’re glad we’re not reading your obituary” that I realised how serious it had been. I felt a wreck and very strange for two weeks afterwards.’

With 14 million books sold worldwide in 36 languages, it was little wonder that Peter decided to press on with his tours. ‘I
 was in agony in Barcelona and painkillers weren’t doing anything for 
the pain in my legs and arm, so I couldn’t sleep. When I got home, I 
visited acupuncturist Mark Andrews in Brighton and within an hour of 
leaving his clinic, 90 per cent of the pain had gone.’

But the relief was short-lived and a book tour of Ireland saw Peter with a ‘constant burning agony in both legs’ which left him ‘hobbling round like an old git’.

He adds: ‘Then I had to go on tour in New York and I was in such pain after the flight that I was wheeled through immigration. The hotel concierge recommended an osteopath, who was brilliant and again got rid of most of my pain.’ 

Back home in Sussex, Peter persevered with his fitness regime – swimming, biking and running. The author of 25 novels also continued with his strict daily writing, working on Want You Dead, his tenth Roy Grace novel.

But typing was increasingly tricky as numbness crept into his right hand. Now the medical profession did some detective work. He saw neurosurgeon Dan Plev at The London Clinic, who referred Peter for a nerve conductivity test. It sent electric shocks from the shoulder to both right and left hand. If the nerves conducted equally in both hands, the pain was not due to the slipped discs but to the median nerve travelling through the carpal tunnel.

‘The neurologist said I had carpal tunnel syndrome as badly as he had ever seen it. Left as it was, I would experience numb fingertips which would increasingly impact on my writing. I already couldn’t feel the space bar on the keyboard and had no feeling in my thumb.’

Carpal tunnel syndrome is caused by 
compression of the nerve that controls feeling and movement in the 
hands.

The carpal tunnel is a narrow passage in the wrist comprising a 
band of tissue and small bones which act as a pulley system for tendons,
 enabling the fingers to bend. CTS occurs in about 50 per cent of 
pregnant women and is more prevalent in those who use their hands 
repetitively such as musicians, hairdressers and typists. It can also be
 hereditary. Surgery is recommended for severe cases if symptoms last 
more than six months or other treatments such as wearing a splint or 
taking anti-inflammatories are ineffective. The carpal ligament is cut 
to ease pressure on the nerve.

Peter
 was treated by consultant orthopaedic, hand and upper limb surgeon 
Elliot Sorene of St John and St Elizabeth Hospital, North London.

But as he began to cut, Peter became visibly unwell. ‘Mr Sorene asked me, “Don’t you go to lots of autopsies?” I replied yes, but not my own. A screen was put up so I couldn’t see, but I could feel tiny electric currents as he was moving the nerves around and I heard crunching. Angela Rippon told me she had the same procedure and watched it from a mirror above the bed. I couldn’t have managed that.

‘It took ten minutes – I went in at 7am and by 8.45 I was being driven home, typing emails all the way. I was determined to not let it stop  me writing.’ Wasn’t that ill-advised? ‘No – my surgeon said just don’t do anything that hurts – and it didn’t.’

One month later, Peter is back to full speed on the writing front, although fastening shirt buttons and winding a watch are tricky. ‘I still have numbness in the thumb and forefinger but it is improving and it may take up to a year to return to normal,’ he says. ‘Touch wood, I have no symptoms in my left hand. Opening a bottle of wine is difficult as you need strength in both hands. But maybe the answer is champagne.’
