Religious grounds: Asia Lemmon, whose legal name appears on her driver's license as Jessica Steinhauser, said the strainer represents her beliefs

A retired adult film star in heavily-Mormon Utah has become the fourth person in the United States to be granted permission to have her driver's license photo taken while wearing a colander on her head as a religious statement.

Asia Lemmon, whose legal name appears on her driver's license as Jessica Steinhauser, said the pasta strainer represents her beliefs in the satirical Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster.

The Flying Spaghetti Monster movement, also known as 'Pastafarianism,' started in 2005 as a protest against teaching intelligent design as an alternative to evolution in Kansas schools.

When she had the photo taken in September, Miss Lemmon said she was not sure if officials at the Division of Motor Vehicles office in Hurricane would allow her to wear the headgear, but 'it was surprisingly really, really easy.'

Nannette Rolfe, the director of Utah's Driver License Division, said about a dozen Pastafarians have had their state driver's license photos taken with a similar colander or pasta strainer on their heads in recent years.

'As long as we can get a visual of the face, we're fine if they choose to wear the headgear,' she said.

Hats and headgear are not allowed for driver's license photos unless they're religious garments, Rolfe said. After the first few Pastafarians came in about two years ago, state officials determined the church is a recognized religion and its members don't require any special paperwork, she said.

Miss Lemmon, a St. George resident, is a retired adult film star who performed under the name Asia Carrera, according to The Spectrum of St George.

She said she wanted to make a statement with the photo.

'I'm a really proud, outspoken atheist,' she said. 'I am proud of Utah for allowing freedom of all religions in what is considered by many to be a one-religion state.'

About two-thirds of the state's residents are Mormons, and Utah is home to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.

Lemmon said even though Utah is a conservative state, everyone has been respectful of her religious views.

Earlier this year, Shawna Hammond, from Oklahoma, was allowed to pose for her license wearing the spaghetti strainer.

Ms Hammond, an atheist, explained that she was allowed to take the photo because she obeyed the state's laws that requires people remove their glasses and wear a religious headpiece that does not cover their face, create shadows, or display text or logos.

In 2005, a physics graduate from Oregon State wrote a letter about a 'Flying Spaghetti Monster' as a form of protest against the Kansas State Board of Education's decision to allow the teaching of Intelligent Design as an alternative to evolution in public schools.

By professing belief in a supernatural entity composed of pasta and meatballs, Bobby Henderson, 24, called on 'Pastafarianism' to be given equal time in science classrooms alongside Christian theory.

Word rapidly spread and the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster (CFSM) now has thousands of followers, mainly on college campuses and in Europe.

The central tenet of CFSM is that an invisible Flying Spaghetti Monster created the universe 'after drinking heavily'.

Pastafarians celebrate every Friday as a holy day - and consider pirates 'absolute divine beings'.
