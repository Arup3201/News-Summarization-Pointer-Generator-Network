It claimed to anonymously expose the boorish and insensitive comments made by Goldman Sachs employees overheard in the firm's elevators.

Indeed, so popular and damning was the @GSElevator Gossip Twitter account that an internal inquiry was set up to discover the name of the indiscreet employee who also found himself bagging a six-figure book deal based on the tweets.

But now, the identity of this rogue trader has been revealed to be 34-year-old former bond executive, John Lefevre, who not only lives in Texas, but has never even worked for Goldman Sachs - much to their relief.

Revealed: This is John Lefevre - who is living in Texas at the moment and who has never worked for Goldman Sachs. He has been exposed as the fake employee behind the @GSElevator Twitter account which lampoons Wall Street bankers

Outed after almost three years of off-color tweets purporting to expose Wall Street culture, such as 'I never give money to homeless people. I can’t reward failure in good conscience,' Lefevre has claimed in an interview with the New York Times that he knew that this 'day would come'.

Claiming he was 'surprised it has taken this long', Lefevre, who graduated prestigious Babson College in 2001, said that he started the Twitter account 'as a joke to entertain' himself.

Rumors that the author of @GSElevator was not even an employee of the Wall Street giant began months ago and Lefevre has assiduously tried to remove all mentions of his name and images from the Internet.

Contacted by the New York Times a few weeks ago, Lefevre, who did admit to working for Citigroup for seven years, was slightly ambiguous about his connection to Goldman Sachs.

'To preempt what you’re about to say, legally speaking,' he said, 'I was never explicitly an employee of the firm.'

The Twitter account was so popular that Goldman Sachs launched an internal inquiry to discover the identity of the indiscreet tweeter

He did admit that he was offered a job as head of debt syndicate in Asia at Goldman Sach's Hong King Office in August 2010.

However, according to the New York Times this offer was revoked after his his employer at the time said that he could not leave because Goldman Sachs were a competitor.

'Things turned nasty with my old boss and he threatened a lawsuit against me and Goldman,' said Lefevre.

Lefevre said that Goldman never withdrew their job offer, saying mysteriously, 'I don’t know how much I can talk about it. It wasn’t acrimonious.'

He categorically denied ever trying to pretend he was ever an employee of Goldman or that he was motivated by anger at not being able to take on his job in 2010.

'This was never about me as a person,' he said. 'It wasn’t about a firm. The stories aren’t Goldman Sachs in particular. It was about the culture in general.'

Poking fun: The tweets that Lefevre posted show a keen sense of how out-of-touch bankers can present themselves to the average-Joe on Main Street

According to his limited professional profile's online, LeFevre works as a hedge fund manager for Amias Berman, which only has a dozen or so employees and is headquartered in London.

For their part, Goldman Sachs declared themselves relieved that they do not have an internal leak.

A spokesman said, 'We are pleased to report that the official ban on talking in elevators will be lifted effective immediately.'

It seems that Lefevre's publisher, Touchstone, does not mind that he is not an actual employee of Goldman Sachs either.

'He’s been pretty straight with us the entire time, so this is not a surprise,' said the book’s editor, Matthew Benjamin, who bought the book without ever meeting Mr. Lefevre, according to the New York Times.

Despite tweeting on fictitious comments overheard in Goldman Sachs' elevators, Lefevre has a very real agent, who claims that everything in his upcoming book is true.

'What matters is that every story in the book is true. John’s material he delivered is hilarious,' said Byrd Leavell to the New York Times.

'The book isn’t going to live or die on whether he worked at Goldman Sachs for two months or not.'

Lefevre said that he started at Citigroup in New York in 2001 following his graduation from Babson College business school.

He spent stints in London and Hong Kong and decided to start the Twitter account in the fall of 2011.

Inspired by an account called @CondeElevator - which reported on what was going on in the elevators of the parent company of Vogue - Lefevre said that he thought he could do better.

'I thought, ‘This is ridiculous that people are infatuated with Condé Nast. If they only saw the elitist, sexist and out-of-touch things bankers say.’ People had no idea what it is really like.'

Despite still working in finance, Lefevre seems to have a healthy contempt for the more outrageous and out-of-touch comments he has overheard bankers make.

'Even socializing with them — going to bars and having guys buy girls drinks and then throw out a line like, ‘Don’t worry ladies, these drinks are on Goldman Sachs.’

He claims he picked on Goldman Sachs due to their fame, but that despite collecting all these stories for year - he does not want to mock his colleagues on Wall Street.

'I do not have an agenda to paint the people or this culture one way or the other,' said LeFevre to The New York Times.

Claiming that his tweets have evolved over time, Lefevre said that like any good capitalist he wants the most people to read his posts so that they are re-tweeted prodigiously.
