There was a time not so long ago that when you bought milk, your choice wouldn’t stretch beyond full-fat, skimmed or semi-skimmed.

But not any more. A whole industry has sprung up to offer a plethora of alternative milks — from almond and coconut to hemp and soya

They’re catering to the increasing numbers of Britons who are lactose-intolerant, who oppose the disturbing treatment of factory-farmed cows or who simply hate the taste of cow’s milk.

There's a whole host of milk alternatives on the market these days, we've taken a look at what's on offer 

Even Coca-Cola has a souped-up version, Fairlife. It is yet to launch in the UK, but the firm says thanks to a special filtration system, it will halve milk’s normal sugar levels, while increasing the calcium and protein content by 50 per cent.

Here, top dietitians help Etan Smallman test six other milks on offer . . .

LACTOSE-FREE

LactoFree (£1.35 per litre at most supermarkets)

Sioned Quirke, the dietitian and spokeswoman for the British Dietetic Association, says that lactose-free milk, such as LactoFree (£1.35 per litre at most supermarkets), offers all the positives of normal milk, but with the lactose (a natural sugar in milk that causes digestion problems for those who are intolerant) broken down by an added enzyme.

As for taste, it is indistinguishable from cow’s milk, and the nutritional composition is almost the same. The LactoFree full-fat variety has 3.5g of fat per 100ml, 3.4g of protein and 57 calories. (Full-fat cow’s milk typically has 4g of fat per 100ml, 3.4g of protein and 68 calories).

Sioned adds: ‘As with cow’s milk, the lactose-free milks come with different percentages of fat. So, unless you’re underweight, go for the lower fat version.’

Nutritionist and registered dietitian Nicole Rothband says: ‘The lactose is broken down into simple sugars so it doesn’t cause any gastro-intestinal disturbance.’

ALMOND MILK

Alpro Original Almond milk (£1.79 per litre at supermarkets nationwide)

For those looking for non-animal-derived milk, almond milk has become hugely popular. David Cameron apparently has it on his cereal and in his tea as a calorie-reducing measure. It has 24 calories per 100ml — half that of semi-skimmed milk. But it also has much less protein. While semi-skimmed has 3.6g per 100ml, almond has 0.5g.

Alpro Original Almond milk (£1.79 per litre at supermarkets nationwide) lists sugar as the second ingredient, which explains why it’s the sweetest-tasting of the bunch. It has a mildly nutty kick, although the actual almond content is just 2 per cent.

Sioned recommends buying the unsweetened version, although one benefit of almond milk is that it contains vitamin E, which is good for the skin.

SOYA MILK

Alpro Original (£1.39 per litre at supermarkets nationwide)

Soya milk is the closest in protein levels to normal milk, with 3g per 100ml in Alpro Original (£1.39 per litre at supermarkets nationwide) and 40 calories.

Taste-wise, it is pleasant with a slightly sweet flavour, but you can sense the difference in tea or coffee, and it does leave an after-taste.

Sioned says: ‘Soya milk wouldn’t affect your cholesterol levels, as it has minimal levels of saturated fat. It is suitable for people on a lactose-free diet, as it’s a good source of protein and calcium.’

COCONUT MILK

Koko Dairy Free (£1.39 per litre at supermarkets nationwide)

Koko Dairy Free (£1.39 per litre at supermarkets nationwide) contains 8.4 per cent coconut milk, with added calcium and vitamins D2 and B12.

It has a sweet and tangy taste, with the coconut coming through strongly.

Our dietitians point out that its protein content is very low (0.2g per 100ml), but while semi-skimmed milk has 1.8g of fat per 100ml, the coconut alternative has a full 2g, and 27 calories.

HEMP MILK

Good Hemp (£1.99 per litre, available at Holland & Barrett)

Hemp milk, such as Good Hemp (£1.99 per litre, available at Holland & Barrett) comes with 2.5g of fat per 100ml and less than 0.1g of protein, but it does provide half of your daily intake of omega 3 per glass.

To my taste buds, it is the most neutral when taken with hot drinks or cereals.

Sioned says: ‘With 2.5g of fat per 100ml, hemp milk is quite high and wouldn’t be good for your cholesterol levels.’

RICE MILK

Rice Dream (£1.38 per litre in most supermarkets)

Rice Dream (£1.38 per litre in most supermarkets) is fortified with calcium and vitamins D2 and B12. It is low in fat (1g per 100ml), but also disappointingly low in protein (0.1g per 100ml). With 47 calories per 100ml, its energy content is identical to that of semi-skimmed. It has a light flavour that doesn’t really resemble cow’s milk, but with a slight sweetness.

However, Nicole Rothband says: ‘Rice milk is not suitable for children under the age of five as a main drink because of the levels of arsenic in it [low levels of arsenic are found naturally in rice].’

DIETITIANS’ VERDICT

Sioned says: ‘If you have a need for a cow’s milk substitute, then these variations are great. But, if not, they tend to be more expensive, not as readily available and have a very different taste.’

Nicole says: ‘If it’s on a taste basis, that’s fine, but there’s a lot less protein in these types of milk. There are also a lot fewer calories, so people may find it useful if they’re trying to lose weight.

‘I would be wary of how much sugar has been added to these milks, and choose one that states that it has calcium and vitamins added. Otherwise, I would suggest people taste a variety and see which one they like best.’
