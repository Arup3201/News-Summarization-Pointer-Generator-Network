A new outlandish theory has been proposed to explain how the aircraft carrying Italian fashion heir Vittorio Missoni and five others vanished without a trace from the skies above the Caribbean last Friday.

It apparently fell victim to the 'Los Roques Curse', a paranormal phenomenon that has been compared to the notorious Bermuda Triangle which has been blamed for the loss of planes and ships in the Atlantic Ocean for the past 60 plus years.

Since the 1990s at least 15 aircraft have crashed or disappeared on the 87 mile journey from the island resort of Los Roques to the Venezuelan capital, Caracas, and now the failure to find Missoni's flight has raised the spectre of the so-called curse again.

In 2008, 14 people died when a plane making the exact same journey Missoni embarked upon disappeared and no wreckage was ever recovered and only one body ever found according to Volaren Venezuela, a website on civil aviation in the South American country.

And to date, four days after his plane went missing, no trace of Missoni has been found.

A hotel owner on the archipelago said that the plane, a twin-engine BN-2 Islander built in 1968, was last seen by him entering into a bank of clouds.

Venezuela’s civil aviation authority said the aircraft’s last recorded position was 18km south of the Los Roques.

Some have claimed that like the mysterious Bermuda Triangle, the 'Los Roques Curse' means that unfortunate souls are abducted by aliens, kidnapped by the last remaining residents of Atlantis, or slightly more realistically are hit by massive releases of methane gas from the seafloor.

However, like the Bermuda Triangle, which stretches between the Atlantic island, South Florida and Puerto Rico, no evidence has ever been found to back up any theories aside from the incidences of strange vanishings.

But, like the Bermuda Triangle, the route from Los Roques to Caracas is heavily traveled and proportionally sees no more disappearances than any other area.

However, both regions produce unpredictable storms and the Gulf Stream is particularly fast and turbulent in the case of the Bermuda Triangle.

'There's always some explanation for these things, even if it takes many years to uncover the answer,' Nick Wall, editor of Pilot, told the Guardian.

'Pilots prefer to concentrate on the things that genuinely will help them live longer, such as fuel gauges, weather reports and engine inspections … it is too early to know for sure what caused this latest incident.'

However, curse or not, at 1.5 million square miles, the Bermuda Triangle dwarfs the area tainted by the hex on the Los Roques.

The first written boundaries of the triangle are the eastern seaboard of the United States, San Juan, Puerto Rico and the mid-Atlantic island of Bermuda.

However, the United States Board on Geographic Names does not recognise the existence of the area and says that there is no issue with the zone, which is one of the most heavily traveled shipping lanes in the world.

Despite all evidence to the contrary, there have been famous disappearances inside the triangle beginning with the loss of the iconic Flight 19.

Five TBM Avenger tropedo bombers vanished on December 5th 1945, while flying over the Atlantic after they took off from Fort Lauderdale and were meant to circle back and return after a training flight.

While no wreckage was recovered, a tanker off the coast of Florida reported seeing an aerial explosion and then observed a widesprea oil slick while they searched for any survivors.

Even though, nothing of the planes was found and their disappearance was featured as a plot device in Steven Spielberg's 'Close Encounters of the Third Kind'.

In the 1977 film, the Oscar winning director imagined that the five aircraft and their pilots were indeed abducted by aliens over the Bermuda Triangle and then returned unharmed to the Sonora Desert in Arizona over 30-years later - unharmed.

It has been reported that several ships have been found drifting without any crews through the otherwise calm Sargasso Sea.Legend has it that in 1840, the French merchant ship, 'Rosalie' was discovered with her sails unfurled but without any crew aboard.The Devil's Sea, also called the Pacific Bermuda Triangle exists off the coast of Miyake Island, south of Tokyo.Ancient Japanese people believed that dragons lived there and numerous ships and aircraft are supposed to have perished in this otherwise calm sea area.
