Hamilton are set to announce Martin Canning as their new manager on Friday.

Defender Canning has been in caretaker charge for three consecutive defeats since Alex Neil left for Norwich, including a 5-0 defeat by Partick Thistle, but the club have a recent history of promoting from within.

Neil was their 31-year-old captain when he replaced Billy Reid following a seven-year reign.

Canning, 33, has made almost 250 appearances for Accies since joining from Hibernian in 2008.

The club have called a media conference for 1.30pm on Friday where they will introduce their new management team.

Vice-chairman Ronnie MacDonald gave a strong indication of the club's preferred route ahead of their heavy defeat at Firhill on Wednesday night.

MacDonald told BBC Scotland: 'We have a clear, clear idea of what we want to do and I'm very happy with the course we are going to go down.

'We are looking for continuity. We don't understand these clubs that have a plan, tear it up, then have another plan.

'We are looking for continuity and people that understand where we are as a club. We are a small club trying to do our best.

'The manager has just got to accept that if we sell a good player that's life and the next one comes in.

'At the moment we are top of the under-17s and top of the under-20s so these boys are all desperate for their chance.'

Reports suggest Hamilton will bring Guillaume Beuzelin into their coaching team. The Frenchman played alongside Canning at Easter Road and then at Hamilton, where he spent the 2009-10 season.

Beuzelin, who is currently assistant manager to Ian Murray at Dumbarton, will be replacing Frankie McAvoy, who is joining Neil at Norwich next week.

McAvoy is saying farewell to Accies after a decade when they host Inverness on Saturday in a game billed as a tribute to both him and Neil, with entry prices cut to 10 pence.
