Police were called to deal with angry shoppers yesterday after a 99p shop stopped its half-price closing down sale mid-afternoon.

Crowds of bargain-hunters who'd gone to the 99p Store in Wrexham specially for the 'Everything 50p' sale refused to leave after store managers said they weren't closing down after all and were putting prices back up to 99p.

They told shoppers - some of whom had queued for hours - that they’d renegotiated their lease at the last minute, so the sale was off, but it wasn't enough to placate the crowds who refused to move until prices came down again.

No entry: Police were called to calm shoppers at the 99p Store in Wrexham after its 50p sale was cancelled

Officers negotiated with shoppers inside the store, many of whom said they'd queued for up to two hours

Police sealed the doors to stop any more shoppers coming in, and the stand-off was only ended after two hours when bosses at the Regent Street discount shop negotiated a 'buy one, get one free' offer.

Once the shoppers inside had bought everything they wanted, store workers took down its posters in the window saying that everything was half-price until January 28, and the 99p Store opened its doors again with everything back up to full price.

Sharon Roberts, from Rhosnesni, north Wales, said: 'I was in there for nearly two hours queuing to get to the till. Then the manager took the posters down from the window.

'People were absolutely furious and that’s why the police were called. Tempers were flaring and people were shouting.

'The shop finally said people could have items on a buy one get one free basis.'

Phil Smith, from Brymbo, said: 'They dropped all the prices to 50p until January 28, and there were queues of about 40 to 50 people all day. Then the manager came around saying everything is back up to 99p.

'I am so angry, you can’t do that - not when people are in the queue to pay. The police had to come because the people were not having it and not leaving.'

Mandy Malloy, from Acrefair, said she had been queuing with a full basket of items for nearly two hours when the news filtered through prices had been put back up to 99p.

'I just dropped my basket where I was and fought my way out through the crowds,” she said. 'It is the principle of it: they said everything was 50p, not 99p. It was a joke.'

  'It all kicked off.  Nobody in that queue was willing to leave or pay the 99p.  People were so angry.'

Lorna Jones, from Caia Park, had to take her young child out of the store as he had become distressed by the angry scenes.

'It all kicked off,' she said. 'Nobody in that queue was willing to leave or pay the 99p. People were so angry.'

Yesterday morning the store had posters in the window saying prices on all items had been slashed to 50p until January 28, when the store was to shut down because the lease on the building was up.

The store later said a lease had been agreed after talks with the landlord, safeguarding 33 jobs.

Tony Brown, chief operating officer for 99p Stores said: 'We genuinely regret the way this was handled. We should have closed the doors and let everybody get out with their items.

'But we are happy we have now arranged for the store to stay open and the jobs have been secured.'

Michael McGivern, spokesman for North Wales Police, said: 'We were asked to assist after the store became very crowded. The store was temporarily closed.'
