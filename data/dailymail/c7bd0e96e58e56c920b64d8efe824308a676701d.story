A postman on his bicycle delivering letters is one of our most familiar sights. 

But not for much longer, Royal Mail said yesterday.

The chairman, Donald Brydon, said: ‘I’m afraid bicycles are going to be a thing of the past’, a decision which he described as ‘sad’.

As a boy growing up in Edinburgh, he said it was ‘one of the thrills’ of his childhood to be allowed to ride on his local postman’s bicycle.

Speaking in Birmingham at the company’s first annual general meeting since its controversial privatisation in October, he said: ‘I remember as a boy in Edinburgh – when the postman came, he came on an old, black bicycle.

‘One of the thrills for me as a five or six-year old was to be allowed to sit on his bike and he pulled the bike along the road and he had his bag of letters slung over his shoulder at that time.

‘It is sad I think that bicycles are no longer the most effective way of transporting mail.’

While the numbers of letters being sent drops year by year, a postman’s bag is now filled with more and more parcels.

Mr Brydon said it can be ‘very unstable’ to use a bicycle to deliver parcels so they are being replaced either by trolleys, typically in urban areas, or vans, mostly used in rural areas.

Some rounds are still done by bicycle, such as those in David Cameron’s constituency of Witney, Oxfordshire. The decision to use bicycles is taken by the local delivery office.

Royal Mail’s fleet of redundant bicycles are sent out to Africa to help local people, such as children to get to school or nurses to do their rounds.
