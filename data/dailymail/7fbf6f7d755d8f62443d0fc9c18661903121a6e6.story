The glamourous alleged accomplice of Manhattan Madam Anna Gristina once tried to break into professional wrestling and has even tried her hand at stand-up comedy.

'Matchmaker' Jaynie Mae Baker, 30, who is originally from Texas, arrived in New York seeking fame and fortune almost a decade ago.

Since her appearance in court this week on charges of promoting prostitution, video footage has emerged of the Southern belle, who now lives in Brooklyn, performing a graphic comedy routine in January.

Stand-up: Since her appearance in court this week on charges of promoting prostitution, video footage has emerged of Jaynie Mae Baker performing a graphic comedy routine in January

Amateur night: A clip posted by Baker on her YouTube channel shows her performing five minutes of stand-up at New York's Gotham Comedy Club

Separate footage of a bikini-clad 
Baker giving a tour of a Miami apartment, and of her dismal 2004 
wrestling audition, has also surfaced.

A
clip posted by Baker on her YouTube channel shows her performing five 
minutes of stand-up during an amateur night at New York's Gotham Comedy 
Club in January.

Perhaps surprisingly for a beginner, Baker does not bomb and even lands a few funny jokes that are appreciated by the audience.

Her routine, however, was squarely on the raunchy side with frequent bad language and gags about pornography and masturbation.

During one skit, she told the audience she was looking at pornographic websites when her boyfriend came in.

She
said: 'I was like, "Hey, you know we have to be at our friends’ house 
for dinner. Do you want to have sex, then maybe shower and head over?"'

The
punchline involved her searching for lingerie while her boyfriend 
proceeded to put on romantic music and open Champagne in another room.

In a reflective mood: Another video shows Baker giving a guided tour of a Miami apartment last year

JC Coleman, host at the Gotham Comedy 
Club, told the New York Daily New: 'I was there that night. It was, 
shall we say, a dry performance. Definitely not a breakout.

'It
was awkward to be in the room. It was New Talent Night, so you have to 
give them the benefit of the doubt. She got some giggles.'

Film
of Baker giving a guided tour of a Miami apartment last year is also on
her YouTube channel. During the tour, Baker can be glimpsed in a mirror
wearing a skimpy bikini.

A 
third video shows Baker auditioning on talent show WWE Raw Diva in 2004,
dressed in floral bikini and a top with a plunging neckline.

She
told the judges: 'I can handle any situation. 'Let me tell you about my
personality. A bit of Southern charm. In a New York way, I can be a bit
sassy when pushed.

'Rolled up into a saucy little sushi roll - I can be a bit stuck up but fun at the same time.'

Baker finally appeared in a Manhattan court on Tuesday, after three weeks on the run.

Hearing: 'Manhattan Madam' Anna Gristina was back in court this week with her attorney Peter Gleason so a judge could decide whether 
or not she is entitled to court-paid defence

Dressed in smart but casual attire, 
Baker looked calm and collected as she was escorted into the court room 
today to face charges of promoting prostitution.

By
her side was high-powered criminal defence attorney Robert Gottlieb, 
who said his client was holidaying in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico, when news 
of the case broke last week and was not in fact 'on the run'.

Mr
Gottlieb said Baker contacted him on Thursday March 8, flew back to New
York last Saturday and had been prepared to turn herself in on Monday.

As
she sat in court for her arraignment with her arms by her side, Baker 
cut a cool figure in comparison to an unkempt and exhausted-looking Anna
Gristina - who has appeared in court twice in the same drab suit with 
messy hair and hands cuffed behind her back.

And
while her alleged business partner languishes in New York's Rikers 
Island prison, Baker was freed on $100,000 bail after pleading not 
guilty to the prostitution charge.

Front? Baker's profile on the website of VIP Life, for which she finds wealthy bachelors ladies looking for love

New York: 304 East 78th Street, the alleged 
Upper East Side brothel where accused Gristina 
reportedly ran a high-class escort service

She
was said to be stunned when she heard she was wanted by police and 
claims her association with Gristina was nothing more than a legitimate 
matchmaking agency.

Baker is
accused of helping run the alleged millionaires-only call girl ring, 
which prosecutors say was operated out of a cramped one-bedroom 
‘brothel’ on East 78th Street for $2,000 per hour.

Baker
claims to work for New York dating company VIP Life which legitimately 
supplies wealthy clients with well-to-do ladies who are looking for 
love.

She faces up to seven years in jail if convicted.

Speaking
from Rikers Island prison last week, Scottish-born Gristina said Baker 
worked for her as a legitimate matchmaker and is innocent of any crime.

Mother-of-four Gristina is accused of having made between $10million and $15million that she has 'squirreled away'.

She
denies a single charge of promoting prostitution and  believes the 
police are trying to force a case rather than having anything concrete 
on her.

Earlier this week, 
she told the New York Post: 'If I’m such a big, high-profile madam, 
making all this money, and they had to investigate me for five years, 
why did they arrest me on a single promoting-prostitution charge - and 
only after I refused to talk to them?'
