Police have detained a 14-year-old 
suspected of participating in the brutal gang rape of an American 
student inside a moving public transit van in Rio de Janeiro.

Brazilian newspaper O Globo reported yesterday that the teen was apprehended in a hiding place in downtown Rio on Sunday.

He is the fourth suspect to be taken 
into custody in the March 30 attack on the American and her French 
companion, who were held for six hours, robbed and beaten before being 
dumped by the roadside.

The other three suspects, aged 20-22, include the van's driver.

The report says the teenager was the 
van's money-taker. It says he has acknowledged robbing the couple and 
beating the man but denied taking part in the rape.

The horrific crime has sparked fear 
among visitors to the metropolis, which is set to host next year's 
football World Cup as well as the 2016 Olympics.

A few minutes after the pair of 
tourists boarded the mini-bus, the operators ordered the
other passengers to get off and inflicted a 'party of evil' on the 
couple.

The three assailants took turns 
raping the woman and beating the man, whom they handcuffed and sometimes
struck with a metal crowbar, police investigator Alexandre Braga said 
yesterday.

The men split up the driving, ending 
up in Rio's sister city of Niteroi across, where they went on a spending
spree with the foreigners' credit cards.

Once they hit the limit on both 
cards, spending around $500 at gas stations and convenience stores, the 
suspects drove the pair back to Rio and forced the woman to fetch 
another credit card, Mr Braga said.

He said that she did not dare call 
for help at this point 'because the young man was still under the 
suspects' control and she feared something even worse might happen to 
him'.

Around six hours after they were 
kidnapped, the tourists - both in their early 20s - were dumped by the 
side of highway 30 miles away from Rio.

They managed to reach a consulate, 
where staff helped them contact police. The woman has returned home, 
while the man is still in Brazil helping officers with their inquiries.

Wallace Aparecido Souza Silva, Carlos
Armando Costa dos Santos and Jonathan Foudakis de Souza have been 
arrested on suspicion of the crime.

'The victims recognised the three 
without a shadow of a doubt,' Mr Braga said. The men's mug shots were 
also recognised by another woman who said she'd been raped by the three 
under similar circumstances last month.

Two of the suspects have confessed to Saturday's attack, while the third denies any responsibility.

It has been reported that the woman and man boarded the minibus in the Copacabana beach district in Rio de Janeiro early on Saturday

Many are now asking whether Rio 
authorities, who have succeeded in cracking down on much of the city's 
drug violence, are up to the task of protecting the waves of tourists 
expected to flood the city during the World Cup and Olympics.

Some 2million people are also 
expected to flock to the city in late July for World Youth Day, a Roman 
Catholic pilgrimage that Pope Francis is scheduled to attend.

Observers said the attack came as a 
particular shock given that safety has improved at least in the city's 
tourist-friendly seaside neighbourhoods.

'No one expects to be attacked in 
Disneyland, handcuffed and roughed up,' said Alfredo Lopes, the head of 
the hotel association. 'Copacabana is our Disneyland.'

Three men boarded the minibus after the woman and her boyfriend got on and forced all the other passengers off, Rio police said

Police have said a Brazilian woman who was raped a week earlier has also identified the suspects

The suspects allegedly rented their 
van, which seats about a dozen people and has dark tinted windows, from 
the vehicle's owner, who has not been linked to the attack.

Rio's van services are widely reviled
for their precarious safety conditions and reckless driving, as well as
their links to organised crime.

Some vans are run by militias largely
composed of former police and firemen who control large swaths of the 
city's slums and run clandestine transportation and other services. In 
general, tourists avoid the vans and opt for regular buses or taxis.

Australian visitors Emma Richardson 
and Jason Sestic said they have been taking extraordinary precautions 
throughout their weeklong stay in Rio.

'We've stayed well away from 
Copacabana and the beach areas at night,' Mr Sestic said. 'I'm a pretty 
paranoid person in general and I've heard enough stories about here to 
be really paranoid.'
