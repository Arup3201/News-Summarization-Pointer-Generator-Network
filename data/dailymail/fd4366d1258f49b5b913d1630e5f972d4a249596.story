He’s been tied to three paramours, but that doesn’t stop former Google CEO Eric Schmidt from speaking amorously about his current wife.

In an extraordinary step, the Google exec publically backed his wife Wendy at a UC Berkeley alumni function two weeks ago.

In his speech, Schmidt lavished on what an important decision it was to attend the research university –partially for his education, but in large part because that’s where he met current wife Wendy.

Schmidt, who is worth nearly 
$7billion, spoke while accepting the award for 2012 alumnus of the year.
He got his M.S. in 1979, and his Ph.D. in 1982 from the university.

Mr Schmidt began his address commenting on the beautiful California weather, but soon transitioned into International House.

‘It is a great institution, and where
I met my wife, Wendy,’ he said, gesturing with a hand and smiling at 
Wendy, who was apparently sitting off camera.

‘Pretty important decision to come to Berkeley, and I-House,’ he said.

According to a report by Gawker, the Google chairman has had at least two paramours in the past – Marcy Simon, Kate Bohner.

The New York Post says he also had a third - Lisa Shields.

All three worked as TV news hands and then went into careers in public relations, according to Gawker.

The Post states that he is currently dating Ms Shields, and has been for more than a year.

As Gawker pointed out, the 
sentimental, romantic gesture to his wife was remarkable in part because their 
relationship is said to be on the rocks.

In February, the New York Post reported that the Google exec was expected to be heading for a divorce costing up to $1.5billion - the second most expensive in history.

The Post reported that the Google 
executive chairman is planning to sell 2.4million of his shares in the 
company to help pay for his split with wife Wendy as he continues a year
and half long liaison with Manhattan beauty Lisa Shields.

Mr Schmidt is looking towards a 
‘transition and an amicable separation and settlement’ with the mother 
of his two children, but needs the extra cash to pay for it according to
the Post.

If it all 
goes to his wife it would mean Schmidt, the 136th richest man in the 
world, would be giving away a quarter of his $6.2billion fortune to 
Wendy, to whom he has been married for 13 years.

During
that time, Schmidt has overseen Google as it has become one of the 
biggest companies on Earth with annual profits of $9.7billion.

A source said: ‘There are many 
reasons why he’s selling shares, mostly business reasons, but he’s also 
working towards a transition and an amicable separation and settlement 
with his wife.

‘They are both very private, so they’re quietly dividing up assets without drawing attention. There’s been no paperwork filed.’

If the divorce goes through then Schmidt’s property empire would be among the assets up for division including his $20million mansion with four acres of land in Montecito, California he bought from U.S. TV show host Ellen Degeneres in 2007.

The site has landscaped gardens, a tennis court, a swimming pool and spa, a 5,000 square foot main house with four bedrooms and six bathrooms.

Millions of viewers were treated to an inside look at the Montecito property when Kim Kardashian rented it for her wedding last year.

Schmidt also has a mansion home in Nantucket in Massachusetts where he and his wife used to spend their summers in addition to a home in Atherton, near Google's Silicon Valley headquarters.

Schmidt's home in Atherton is worth $3.7million and has five bedrooms and three-and-a-half bathrooms covering a total of 4,840 sq ft. The neighbours include actress Shirley Temple and Grateful Dead singer Bob Weir.

Schmidt also owns the 195-foot super yacht Oasis which he bought for $72.3million.

The boat its said to be one of the 
‘highest spec yachts ever built’ with its own pool and gym that can be 
converted into a disco.

The divorce would also shed a light on the exact nature of Schmidt’s marriage, which has been the subject of speculation for years.

Schmidt’s current girlfriend is Council on Foreign Relations executive Lisa Shields, 46, who he has been seeing for a year-and-a-half.

The two were seen together last 
summer in the Hamptons and he has bought her a Dutch Warmblood 
show-jumping horse as a token of his affection.

Schmidt and Shields were seen cruising on Oasis in the Caribbean and the South of France last summer.

Shields,
a divorced mother, used to be a producer at ABC News and was linked to 
Andrew Cuomo shortly before he began dating Sandra Lee.

Schmidt
stepped down as chief executive and chairman after ten years in the 
role last April and was given a $100million parting gift.

1. Rupert Murdoch and Anna Murdoch: $1.7 billion

2. Formula 1 tycoon Bernie Ecclestone and Slavica Ecclestone: $1.2 billion.

3. Saudi businessman Adnan Khashoggi's and Soraya Khashoggi:  $874 million

4. Tiger Woods and Elin Nordegren: $750 million as part of their divorce settlement.

5. Casino operator Stephen Wynn and Elaine Wynn: $740 million

Wendy Schmdit has a master's in journalism from Berkeley and has played a prominent role in the Eric Schmidt Family Foundation, which campaigns for responsible use of natural resources.

The most expensive divorce in history was between media mogul Rupert Murdoch and his wife Anna, which cost him a reported $1.7billion.

Currently the second most expensive was between Formula 1 tycoon Bernie Ecclestone and his model wife Slavicia which was a reported $1.2 billion.

A Google spokesman said in February: ‘The sale is part of a standard selling procedure to allow for diversification.’

Divorce lawyer Ayesha Vardag said that Schmidt could potentially lose even more than quarter of his wealth as under California law anything earned during a marriage is split 50 / 50.

She said: 'The principle is known as community property and it is fairly cut and dried - anything earned by either party during the marriage is split down the middle.

'The biggest thing that will be argued about in a divorce like this is not so much the proportion of a husband's money but what is in the pot.

'Liquidity will be a big issue and he will either have to borrow against the value of his stocks in Google or sell them, which would be destabilising for him and the company.

'I would be advising Mr Schmidt to get a realistic assessment about the worth of Google whilst trying to make the assessment it as conservative as possible - and keep things civilised.

'If he has a pre-nup, which are valid in California, it will significantly limit the amount his wife is entitled to.'
