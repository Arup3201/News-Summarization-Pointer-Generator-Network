Murdered: Teenager Stephen Lawrence was killed in 1993

The remarkable legacy of hope created in Stephen Lawrence’s name breaks new ground today with the launch of journalism scholarships sponsored by the Daily Mail.

The Stephen Lawrence Charitable Trust, founded by the murdered teenager’s mother in 1998, already has a track record of helping disadvantaged students into careers in architecture – the profession which A-level student Stephen dreamed of entering.

As part of an initiative to expand its work into other professions, the trust has now joined the Mail to offer two aspiring journalists the chance to learn the trade on our renowned training course. 

Stephen’s mother Doreen Lawrence, now Baroness Lawrence of Clarendon, said: ‘I am delighted to announce the Stephen Lawrence trainee reporter scholarship in partnership with the Daily Mail.

‘The Stephen Lawrence Charitable Trust’s mission is to transform the career opportunities of aspiring, talented young people from disadvantaged backgrounds.

‘This rare opportunity to train in journalism via the highly sought-after “best course in the business” – on the Daily Mail – is an excellent example of how we demonstrate Stephen’s legacy.’

Baroness Lawrence said the trust’s aims and ethos are ‘watering the seeds of ambition’.

Those from lower income households, or who attend or attended a non-fee paying school or are the first generation of their immediate family to attend university, are strongly encouraged to apply for the 14-month journalism course.

The successful applicants will be paid a competitive salary while they train. The course starts at the end of August, leading to consideration for a full-time post after completion. Details of the scholarships are being sent to inner city schools, academies and universities.

Stephen was stabbed to death at the age of 18 in an unprovoked racist attack at a bus stop in Eltham, South East London, in 1993. The Mail campaigned to bring the killers to justice and published a landmark front page accusing five men of the murder.

In February 1997, under the headline MURDERERS, we printed pictures of each of the suspects after they arrogantly refused to answer the most basic of questions at an inquest into Stephen’s death.

The subsequent Macpherson Inquiry into the killing accused the Met of being ‘institutionally racist’. 

Two of the men named – Gary Dobson and David Norris – were eventually convicted of murder in 2012.

Paul Dacre, Editor of the Daily Mail, said: ‘We share with Stephen’s family the wish that more hardworking students from disadvantaged backgrounds should also look to journalism as a career – just as Stephen aspired to become an architect before his life was so viciously cut short. 

'We are delighted that we have been able to provide a substantial investment for these bursaries and bring them into our training scheme.’

Since it was founded, the Stephen Lawrence Charitable Trust has awarded more than 100 architecture bursaries, with many students going on to qualify as architects.
