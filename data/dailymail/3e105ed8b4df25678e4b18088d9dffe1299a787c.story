It is not everyone who can carry off edgy fashion looks such as a metallic gold leather skirt when they are also old enough to carry a free bus pass.

But Twiggy, 64, has put her years of modelling experience to good use with the launch of her latest clothing range for M&S.

The Twiggy for M&S collection, which will be available to buy online from Thursday, is the latest in Twiggy's collaboration with the retailer, and it seems that the decades haven't dampened her love for fashion.

Previous collections have made liberal use of snakeskin and sequins, and this latest range sees Twiggy rock the leather look, with a metallic gold skirt just in time for the festive season.

The AW13 and SS14 collections see the return of some of Twiggy’s personal favourites, from the perfect lace dress to the classic 'jegging' and jersey t-shirt, alongside some exciting new wardrobe must-haves including leather and knitwear, such as a colour block shift dress with figure flattering jersey panels.

The SS14 collection, due to launch in February, has a distinctive new look and feel, incorporating stunning new prints and modern shaping into the collection.

Twiggy, who began her modelling career in the swinging sixties and has featured in Vogue and Tatler magazines as well as being photographed by top fashion photographers such as David Bailey and Patrick Lichfield, said: ‘My relationship with M&S continues to be an exciting journey, from modelling to designing my online range. I am so incredibly proud of where the Twiggy for M&S Collection is today. I believe it’s a celebration of femininity, it's about being able to have fun with fashion and showing that you can be stylish and confident whatever your age, shape and size.'

Twiggy, whose real name is Lesley Hornby, was brought up in the North London surburb of Neasden. She was given her nickname due to her slight build, and quickly became famous for her androgenouss, waifish look with short hair and heavy make-up.

She has modelled for M&S since 2005 and has featured in many of its advertising campaigns alongside other famous women including Danni Minogue and Myleene Klass. However they were contraversially dropped from M&S's most recent campaign, 'Leading Ladies' in favour of Tracey Emin, Helen Mirren and Darcey Bussell.
