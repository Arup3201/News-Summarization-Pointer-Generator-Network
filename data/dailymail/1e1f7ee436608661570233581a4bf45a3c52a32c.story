Looking as impeccable as the Queen clearly takes some effort - and she certainly doesn't travel light. A van crammed with shoes, hat boxes and bagged dresses accompanied her as she arrived in Scotland today.

After the royal couple, who were celebrating their 67th wedding anniversary with a trip to Moray, had been driven away from Elgin Station, staff quickly unloaded the royal train and ferried a succession of boxes to the waiting vehicle.

The items were all labelled with yellow tags with 'The Queen' written on them. A number of suitcases were also packed into the vehicle which followed the Queen, who was resplendent in lavender Karl Ludwig and a hat by Angela Kelly, as she travelled to RAF Lossiemouth.

Earlier, the Queen was all smiles as she was welcomed by Lieutenant Colonel Grenville Johnston, the Lord Lieutenant of Moray, on the platform at Elgin Station.

The monarch's smile grew even broader when a little boy approached clutching a bouquet of flowers, which she happily accepted before spending several minutes chatting to the child and his mother.

Prince Philip, who is fresh from a visit to Germany where he presented service medals to troops returning from Afghanistan, also looked on fine form, smiling broadly as he met well-wishers, many of whom were waving Union flags.

The royal couple had arrived in Elgin ahead of a visit RAF Lossiemouth and the neighbouring Kinross Barracks, where the Queen unveiled a plaque at the new purpose-built Quick Reaction Alert facility.

Once there, the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh were welcomed with a flypast, which included two Typhoons and a Tornado jet, following a parade inside the aircraft hangar which also saw them inspect personnel from No.1 (Fighter) Squadron.

It was the Queen’s first visit to the base since 2003 and formally recognised the transfer of the Quick Reaction Alert (QRA) facility from RAF Leuchars to Lossiemouth.

The facility is one of two in Britain that stands ready to scramble jets to intercept any unidentified aircraft in northern airspace. The other is at RAF Coningsby in Lincolnshire.

Slow journey: The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh travelled to Scotland on the Royal Train

The Queen and Prince Philip, who were married on November 20 1947, travelled overnight from London on the Royal Train to Elgin and were then driven to nearby Lossiemouth, where they met pilots and their families, including eight-year-old Lennon Gallagher, who gave the monarch a second posy.

The Lossiemouth schoolboy said he knew it was their wedding anniversary but was not nervous to hand over the flowers, made up with colours from the RAF Lossiemouth tartan, to mark the visit.

'I got the day off school to give the Queen flowers,' he explained. 'She said "thank you, they’re so beautiful".' His father, Corporal Brendan Gallagher, added: 'We were told (about the visit) last month but we had to keep it quiet because Lennon didn’t know.

'We knew he’d be super excited and want to tell people in school if we told him too early, so we only told him the other day. It’s been great, we’re so proud of him.'

One of the oldest Royal Air Force bases in Britain, RAF Lossiemouth began life in 1938 and first saw active service during World War Two when it became the base for No. 15 Flying Training School before being handed over to Bomber Command in 1940.

Ravishing: The Queen looked wonderful in a pretty lilac ensemble and her trademark Launer London 'Judy' handbag 

All smiles: The Queen seemed pleased to meet her welcome party who stood at the station waiting her arrival

Although much of the work done at the base involved training bomber crews, it was also the home of the famous Dambusters squadron, which launched the successful raid on the German battleship Tirpitz from the base in 1944.

Now home to three combat squadrons as well as 'D-Flight' which operates Sea King search and rescue helicopters, it remains one of the busiest RAF bases in Britain.

Most recently, Typhoon aircraft based at Lossiemouth had to be scrambled after a Russian Bear Bomber approached UK air space at the beginning of the month.

The Soviet-era Tupolev Tu-95 aircraft were tracked as they flew across the North Sea before being intercepted by RAF pilots, who escorted them out of British airspace.

Wing Commander Mike Sutton said: 'QRA is one of the most critical roles that the UK military has. It is made up with Typhoon aircraft permanently on standby to launch at very short notice, 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, to assist aircraft in distress or for any incursions on UK airspace that we need to investigate.

'Today is an enormous day for RAF Lossiemouth and we’re delighted to be hosting Her Majesty. As you can see we have lots of families visiting today and there’s a real good feeling on the station.'

Here she comes! Her Majesty's silhouette could be seen from inside the train carriage as she approached the exit 

All smiles: Both halves of the royal couple looked in good health and on fine form as they arrived at the Scottish station

Cheers: The royal couple were met by an enthusiastic crowd which numbered a group of flag waving school children among its members
