With every pivotal moment in human history, it seems a conspiracy theory is not far behind.

When men first landed on the moon, people soon claimed that the achievement had in fact been faked in a studio in Hollywood.

And when Nasa landed its Curiosity rover on Mars, some were adamant the agency had fooled us all by filming it in Nevada.

And now, after Esa completed humanity's first ever landing on a comet, so-called UFO experts have claimed 67P is not a comet at all - but in fact a spaceship.

UFO believers claim Europe's comet mission had a hidden task. They said comet 67P (pictured) is actually an alien spaceship sending signals. And they claim Esa sent the Rosetta spacecraft there to make contact. The bizarre claims were apparently exposed by an anonymous Esa 'whistle blower'

One of the most bizarre claims was made by Scott Waring of the website UFO Sightings Daily.

He said he had received an email from an anonymous Esa 'whistle blower' that claimed intelligent-sounding signals had been received from comet 67PChuryumov-Gerasimenko 20 years ago and the object is actually an alien ship in disguise.

The email said: 'Do not think for one moment that a space agency would suddenly decide to spend billions of dollars to build and send a spacecraft on a 12-year journey to simply take some close-up images of a randomly-picked-out comet floating in space.

'Comet 67P is not a comet.'

Comets are of great interest to scientists because they are the oldest and most primitive bodies in the solar system that we know of.

They preserve the earliest record of material from the nebula from which our sun and planets formed.

While the planets in the solar system have gone through chemical transformations, comets have remained almost unchanged in the 4.5 billion year history of the solar system.

It is also thought that they brought certain elements to planets, including water.

They also carry complex organic molecules that may triggered life on Earth.

The whistle blower, who insisted on remaining anonymous for fear of reprisals, insisted the comet 'is only being disguised as such' and appears able to change trajectory at will.

The letter added: 'As for who is disguising it and why I cannot answer; all I can tell you is that whatever this thing is, it does show signs on its outside of machine-like parts and unnatural terrain.

'Whatever this object is it did not ask to be found or scrutinised, and it appears for good reason.'

Other theorists spoke of 'alien structures' in images of the comet, in particular a bright white 'metallic' disc on or hovering above the 2.5 mile (4km) wide lump of ice and dust, and a sculpted non-human face.

Esa unwittingly sent the speculation into overdrive when it disclosed that the comet was 'singing'. Clicking oscillations in the object's magnetic field, below the range of human hearing, sounded strangely tuneful.  

Yesterday, Esa's Philae lander completed its landing on a comet and returned this image, which is the first ever picture from the surface of a comet. The historic moment has been heralded as one of humanity's greatest achievements in space exploration.

Another post from 'ex-naval electronics warfare technician' Carl Blackman on the website BPEarthWatch said: 'Definitely not a natural signal, there is intelligent based stuff going on here.'

On the same site, ImTheDaveman commented: 'This signal is very much a non-natural source. The irony of Rosetta being sent there is too strong a coincidence.'

Another post on UFO Sightings Daily argued that the signal 'had to have been made for humanity'.

It added: 'Is it a message of greetings? Or is it a warning of what's to come? We the people of the world need to find out.'

Of course, the comet isn't really 'singing'. It is emitting a natural signal at 40-50 millihertz that, when amplified a few thousand times, sounds like a familiar sound.

The music was heard clearly by the magnetometer experiment for the first time in August, when Rosetta drew to within 60 miles (100 km) of the comet.

Scientists think it must be produced by the activity of the comet, as it releases neutral particles into space where they become electrically charged due to a process called ionisation.

UFO expert Nigel Watson, author of Haynes UFO Investigation Manual, told MailOnline: 'The stories and rumours surrounding Comet 67P reflect the growing belief that aliens from outer space have, since the distant past, been making regular visits to our neck of the galaxy.

'The obsession with turning any unusual rock photographed on Mars into an animal or artefact, and viewing any speck of light or object captured by spacecraft cameras as alien spaceships is part of our need to believe that we are not alone.

'These activities also indicate that many ufologists have virtually given up on actually investigating UFO sightings made on Earth, and indicates their frustration with being unable to find solid evidence to prove that UFOs are alien craft.'
