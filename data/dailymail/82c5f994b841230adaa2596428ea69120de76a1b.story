These are the adorable first images of newborn octopus hatchlings, which, even with their eight legs, are still smaller than a penny.

The octopi hatched overnight between March 17 and March 18 at the Mote Marine Laboratory, in Sarasota in Florida.

The species of octopus - a Caribbean pygmy - are typically nocturnal, with the babies often hiding in order to avoid predators.

According to staff, the mother octopus arrived at the marine lab after she had already mated.

The octopi are born fully intact and can hunt almost immediately.

This particular species of octopi will grow to about the size of a silver dollar and eat small benthic invertebrates which live at the bottom of the sea.

Octopi reproduction is rather unique - males have a specially adapted arm which they use to transfer sperm packets into to a female's mantle cavity.

Octopi lead short, solitary lives of one to two years, and males and females do not remain together. 

Males die within a few months of mating. 

The female at Mote laid around 50 eggs, which took around two months to hatch.

After eggs are laid, the female devotes the rest of her life to caring for them. 

She will guard the eggs and keep water circulating around them so that the developing offspring receive enough oxygen.

The mother stops eating after her eggs are laid, and dies soon after they hatch.
