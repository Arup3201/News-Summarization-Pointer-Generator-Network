A group of yobs have been caught on CCTV vandalising a street by knocking over bins - then being forced to clean up their mess by police.

The young men, who had apparently been on a night out in York, began overturning wheelie bins and throwing bags of rubbish into the street.

With the roads deserted at 2.30am, they presumably thought their antics would go unnoticed - but they were being monitored on surveillance cameras the whole time.

Caught on CCTV: A group of vandals were filmed rampaging down the street in York last week

Carnage: The yobs knocked over wheelie bins and threw bags of rubbish into the road

Intervention: The police arrived on the scene after being called by CCTV operators monitoring the situation

Punishment: Officers looked on as the vandals cleared up the damage they had done to the road

CCTV operators called the police, who rushed to the scene and stopped the vandals from continuing their anti-social behaviour.

Officers gave the men a stern talking to - and told them to pick up the rubbish and restore the bins to their rightful place.

In the CCTV footage, the culprits can be seen shamefacedly undoing all their damage.

No further action will be taken over the incident, which took place in the early hours of the morning on January 7.

Running around: Little did the perpetrators know that everything they did was monitored on CCTV

Wanton: The young men were throwing around bags filled with rubbish in the York street

York City Council and North Yorkshire Police have decided to publicise the video clip in a bid to let other would-be offenders know that they will not get away with anti-social actions.

Councillor Linsay Cunningham-Cross said: 'This was a wasteful antic which thankfully was spotted quickly by our CCTV operatives and dealt within a matter of minutes by North Yorkshire Police.

'Working with the police this case demonstrates that our state-of-the-art technology has helped to keep residents safe and protected our communities from crime.'

Stepping in: A police car drew up at the scene after being contacted by those monitoring the situation

Mess: Officers saw the extent of the damage after arriving at the scene of the anti-social behaviour

Turning the tables: Police made the yobs undo all the mess they had made in the street

Humiliation: But the perpetrators will face no further action over the incident on January 7

Superintendent Phil Cain added: 'This particular incident was quickly spotted by CCTV operators allowing police officers to be on the scene within minutes to deal with the situation before it could cause too much concern or upset to the general public.

'I commend the officers involved for dealing with manner win a sensible and proportionate manner, and hopefully the lads in question will learn some lessons from this and improve their conduct in the future.'

The council said that the incident showed the capabilities of the York Travel and Control Centre.

Each month on average, the centre monitors over 1,000 hours of live CCTV footage, records more than 550 incidents and provides police with 40 pieces of evidence.
