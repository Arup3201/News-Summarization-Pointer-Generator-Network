Senior Liberal Democrats were accused of a ‘chicken run’ from the Coalition last night as three MPs left the Government so they can concentrate on holding their Commons seats.

After Home Office minister Norman Baker quit, Nick Clegg also had to find replacements for two Lib Dem whips – Mark Hunter and Jenny Willott – who decided to stand down.

Tory MPs ridiculed their Coalition partners for what they suggested was a misguided attempt to distance themselves from the Government amid fears of a drubbing at May’s General Election.

Theresa May was last night installed as the favourite to succeed David Cameron as Tory MPs cheered her for forcing out the ‘eccentric’ Mr Baker.

The steely Home Secretary overtook Boris Johnson in a poll of Conservative members on who should be the next party leader. Mr Cameron backed Mrs May, saying she was ‘tough and robust’ to deal with but that was her strength.

Of Mr Baker’s departure, the Prime Minister said scathingly: ‘We’ll cope without him.’ He added: ‘I have worked with Theresa May for eight or nine years. She is a very effective politician, a very effective administrator. I want someone who is a tough Home Secretary – it’s a tough world out there.’

Chancellor George Osborne also dismissed Mr Baker’s resignation, mocking him in the Commons as a ‘conspiracy theorist’.

Mr Baker, a former transport minister, was appointed to the Home Office last year after Mr Clegg axed Home Office minister Jeremy Browne, one of the leading figures on the Lib Dem right.

Mrs May was given no forewarning of his appointment, which was condemned as an ‘elaborate Lib Dem in-joke’ by Tory MPs.

Mr Baker has written a book, in which he suggested UN weapons inspector Dr David Kelly was murdered by an Iraqi hit squad and the incident was covered up by British security services. He has also said he believes the death of former Labour foreign secretary Robin Cook may have been suspicious.

Government sources were astonished that Mr Baker had been promoted to a position in which he was expected to work closely with the security services, having expressed such views.

Announcing his resignation, Mr Baker likened working with the Home Secretary to ‘walking through mud’, accusing her of refusing to agree to his policy proposals. In particular, the two clashed over Mr Baker’s controversial suggestion that the possession of drugs should be decriminalised. He said: ‘The Home Secretary was reluctant to let me have my head and it was a constant battle to try to get things through.

‘I have done it for a year, it is very hard work – the Home Office is probably at the cutting edge of the Coalition. It is where most policy issues are difficult, whether it is Europe or immigration. It has not been helped by the lurch to the right from the Conservative party as they chase Ukip off to the fringes.’

Mr Baker, a member of a rock band, The Reform Club, added: ‘I want a break. I want to spend more time with my family, more time in my constituency, more time doing stuff I want to do, like my music.’

Tory sources said Mr Baker was leaving to try to distance himself from the Government and seek to defend his majority of 7,000 in Lewes, under threat because of the Lib Dem collapse in the polls. One said: ‘He was never at the Home Office. He was only there two days a week. He spent most of Mondays in his constituency and then he was away by Thursday morning to prepare for his local radio show.’

The source added: ‘He never got on with Theresa. I think he was one of those people who have trouble working for a powerful woman. He did not report to her. He came in and announced he was effectively the Lib Dem home secretary. Not surprisingly, he was told where to go.’

Former Tory Home Office minister Damian Green said tensions had arisen because Mr Baker had tried to act as if he had the same ministerial rank as Mrs May. He said: ‘He regarded himself as being on a par with the Home Secretary and asked for papers from other ministers – he wanted to check what everyone else was doing.’

‘The world doesn’t work like that. He was a guitarist who was only interested in his own solos while the rest of the band was trying to play a close harmony number.’

But Lib Dem president Tim Farron complained: ‘Theresa May behaves as though the Conservatives won the last election. They didn’t and it’s an insult to the electorate to act as though they did.’

Last night, a poll of members by the ConservativeHome website found Mrs May has the backing of 24 per cent as the party’s next leader – ahead of Mr Johnson, who has led for several months, on 22 per cent.

Mr Clegg moved international development minister Lynne Featherstone, who worked at the Home Office between 2010 and 2012, back to her old department to replace Mr Baker.

Norman Baker’s bitter parting shot at Theresa May was that, while he had been able to work perfectly amicably with Tory colleagues at the Department for Transport, the Home Office had been like ‘walking through mud’.

Undoubtedly, this is true. But if his resignation was timed to inflict maximum damage on Mrs May – who has endured a wretched week, lurching from immigration scandals, to the ongoing sex abuse inquiry debacle – it backfired spectacularly.

Indeed, she will have positively purred at Mr Baker’s comment that she regards the Home Office ‘as a Conservative department in a Conservative government’.

Mr Baker was said to have been kept on a short leash from the outset by the Home Secretary and her advisers

She does – and many backbench Tories wish her Cabinet colleagues would take the same position, rather than pandering to Lib Dems on the verge of electoral annihilation.

Mr Baker was kept on a short leash from the outset by the Home Secretary and her advisers. But should this really have come as a surprise to the Lib Dem – and who can blame Mrs May for not letting this political maverick loose in a department where one slip can be lethal?

The only mystery is why Nick Clegg ever considered Mr Baker a suitable candidate to be sent to the Home Office (other than to irritate Mrs May, who is his biggest enemy in the Cabinet).

On his first day in the job, Mr Baker was forced to defend his oft-stated view – contained in a book he authored while not in government – that British spies covered up the murder of scientist Dr David Kelly by an Iraqi hit squad.

Mrs May, who dominates her Home Office department like no other Cabinet minister in Whitehall

It was hardly an auspicious start to life in the department which oversees MI5 and it soon became clear there would be significant tensions with Mrs May. Mr Baker’s two Lib Dem predecessors at the Home Office had caused her little trouble.

Jeremy Browne, on the right of Mr Clegg’s party, was respected within the department and rarely strayed into controversy.

Lynne Featherstone, who now returns to the department for a second stint, stuck to a brief covering equalities – on which she and Mrs May largely agree.

Mr Baker, by contrast, wanted to find differences of opinion with the Tories – and for them to be known about publicly.

He also wanted to behave like a ‘Lib Dem home secretary’, challenging the authority of Mrs May, who dominates her department like no other Cabinet minister in Whitehall and whose junior ministers very much understand their subordinate role. 

There was an initial skirmish on gun laws. Mr Baker wanted to increase the £50 fee for a licence. The Tories, conscious of not upsetting the countryside, blocked him.

He also went off on a tangent from time to time, accusing retailers of encouraging shoplifting by introducing self-service tills.

But it was on drugs where the real bust-ups occurred. Mrs May repeatedly thwarted his plans, including pilot projects for GP prescribing of heroin, licences for medical use of cannabis, and free foil to reduce the harm involved in injecting heroin.

Last week, she immediately binned a Home Office review, which the Lib Dems had insisted on commissioning, on the case for decriminalising the use of some drugs.

Some allies of Mr Baker sought to portray this as the final straw, but he had been planning to walk away for a couple of months – not least because of the need to defend his vulnerable majority in Lewes, East Sussex.

But he has done Mrs May a huge favour with the manner of his departure and his complaints that she will not play nicely with her junior partners.

The only loose cannon in her department has gone and her leadership credentials are, if anything, bolstered.
