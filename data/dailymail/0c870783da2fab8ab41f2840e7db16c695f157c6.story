The IRS 'lost' the emails of six other agency officials associated with a scheme to target conservative organizations – in addition to those of former official Lois Lerner – and kept it a secret for months, the House Ways and Means committee learned on Tuesday.

The news prompted the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee to issue broad subpoenas on Tuesday afternoon for hard drives, thumb drives and other backups that Lerner and the tax authorities may have used to archive her messages.

Ways and Means chairman Dave Camp and Rep. Charles Boustany, who chairs the Ways and Means oversight subcommittee, said that the IRS has known as far back as February that it no longer had email correspondence for Lerner and other key players implicated in the tea party targeting scandal and failed to share that information with Congress.

'It looks like the American people were lied to and the IRS tried to cover-up the fact it conveniently lost key documents in this investigation,' the duo said in a press release.

'Plot lines in Hollywood are more believable than what we are getting from this White House and the IRS.'

The Exempt Organizations Division of the IRS is at the center of a scandal involving years of intrusive screening of
 conservative groups that sought tax-exempt status beginning in 2009.

Hundreds of them saw their applications delayed or denied while 
politically liberal organizations skated by and quickly received 
approval. 

The
 IRS informed the committee on Friday that 28 months of emails of the former head of the tax-exempt division, Lois Lerner, had been lost in a computer crash and could not be recovered because many records were not backed 
up on servers, tapes or external drives.

Its own guidelines require that
 'IRS offices will not store the official recordkeeping copy of e-mail 
messages that are federal records ONLY on the electronic mail system.'

It also requires its offices to back up email messages to 'a separate electronic recordkeeping system.'

The Daily Caller reported on Tuesday that IRS regulations require employees to print out copies of all communications that are subject to federal recordkeeping laws.

'The Treasury Department’s current email policy requires emails and attachments that meet the definition of a federal record be added to the organization’s files,' the agency's employee guidance reads, 'by printing them (including the essential transmission data) and filing them with related paper records.'

According to the IRS, none of this happened and Lerner's emails from January 2009 to April 2010 are missing.

Now the IRS says its also missing emails for Nikole Flax, who served as Chief of Staff to Steve Miller, then- Deputy Commissioner of the IRS.

Flax visited the White House more than a dozen times between July 2010 and April 2013, according to a Politico.

The Ways and Means committee leaders said Tuesday that Flax's repeated visits to the White House were suspicious and will be the subject of further investigation.

'Who was she visiting at the White House and what were they talking about?  Was she updating the White House on the targeting or was she getting orders? These are answers we don’t yet have, because – surprise, surprise – a few computers crashed,' they said.

Internal Revenue Service Commissioner John Koskinen will be hauled before two House committee hearings next week to explain how Lois Lerner's emails could have been lost despite robust data-retention standards in the U.S. government

Cruella de Washington: Lois Lerner retired with a full government pension and has refused to testify about her role in a years-long scheme to target tea party groups with politically imbalanced scrutiny

Camp and Boustany said Monday that 'we are simply not going 
to accept the IRS claim that these documents are not recoverable. We 
will demand the president live up to his promise to work "hand in hand" 
with Congress to get the facts.'

The
 two lawmakers wrote to President Obama yesterday asking for its 
records of emails between Lerner and employees the White House, the 
Treasury Department, the Department of Justice, the Environmental 
Protection Agency, the Federal Election Commission and the Occupational 
Safety & Health Administration.

That
 move came hours after Ways and Means committee staff interviewed government employees 
charged with running the IRS's internal computer networks.

A
 committee aide told MailOnline that those IRS workers confirmed that 
budget and space limitations forced the agency to limit officials' 
access to networks that would ordinarily store email archives.

They
 also said, according to the aide, that other executive branch agencies 
have their own independent archives of the records now lost at the IRS.

Camp and Boustany asked Obama to order 'an exhaustive search for all Lois Lerner emails' throughout the executive branch.

Republicans
 hope to establish whether or not Lerner colluded with Obama 
administration officials to play political favorites and single out 
right-wing groups for special scrutiny.

But
 the White House is likely under no obligation to cooperate. President 
Obama has already referred to the IRS matter as one of several 'phony 
scandals' that he believes are politically motivated.

Yet in May 2013 when the scandal first erupted, Obama pledged that his administration would 'make sure that we are working hand in hand with Congress to get this thing fixed.'

Subpoena: Rep. Darrell Issa is demanding Koskinen show up for an evening interrogation on June 23

The Ways and Means Republicans threw that phrase back in the president's face on Monday.

'In order to ensure accountability and “get this thing fixed,” please provide ... all communications between Lois Lerner and any persons within the Executive Office of the President (EOP) for the period between January 1, 2009 and May 1, 2011,' they wrote.

'Also, please indicate in writing when the EOP [Executive Office of the President] was informed, and by whom, that the IRS had lost critical Lerner documents.'

Yesterday, California
 Rep. Darrell Issa, who chairs the House Oversight and Government Reform
 Committee, demanded that IRS Commissioner John Koskinen explain – in person –
 how 28 months of emails to and from 
Lerner were 'lost' to a computer crash.

Issa wrote to Koskinen in reaction to his agency's claim Friday 
that the IRS no longer has copies of emails between Lerner and anyone 
outside the IRS from January 2009 through April 2011.

Issa demanded in his letter that Koskinen appear in a rare evening hearing on June 23, a 
half-day before he's scheduled to testify before the House Ways and 
Means Committee.

'I
 will not tolerate your continued obstruction and game-playing in 
response to the Committee’s investigation of the IRS targeting,' he 
wrote.

'For
 too long, the IRS has promised to produce requested – and, later, 
subpoenaed – documents, only to respond later with excuses and 
inaction.'

In the House Oversight Committee, Issa hammered Koskinen for promising in a March 26 hearing that he would deliver every email Congress sought.

At the time, however, he insisted that it would take 'years' for lawyers to sift through them all and excise private taxpayer information that the IRS isn't permitted to share – not even with other arms of government.

And simply searching through Lerner's individual email storage, Koskinen said then, wouldn't produce an exhaustive record.

'They’re stored somewhere,' he explained to Utah Rep. Jason Chaffetz during the hearing.

'They get taken off and stored in servers and you’ve got 90-thousand employees,' he insisted, but 'we can find, and we are in fact searching – we can find Lois Lerner’s emails.'

At the time, he didn't mention the computer crash which became an overnight butt of jokes among conservatives.

'It's OK. The NSA has the original files,' Capitol HIll speechwriter Amanda Carpenter tweeted.

'Wonder what the #IRS would say if we told them we couldn’t submit tax documents because of a computer crash?' replied her boss, Texas Republican Sen. Ted Cruz.

'Wheel of Fortune' game show host Pat Sajak, who has begun wearing his conservatism on his sleeve in recent years, tweeted: 'Weird. Hundreds of emails to & from someone named Lerner just showed up in my spam. Must be British. Lots of tea talk.'
