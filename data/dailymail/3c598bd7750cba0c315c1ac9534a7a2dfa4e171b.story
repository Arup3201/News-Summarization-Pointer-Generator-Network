England buried their demons in Cardiff last minute – climbing out of a ‘big hole’ at 10-0 down to claim one of the most impressive and significant victories of recent years.

This was a momentous result to launch the RBS Six Nations. The visitors were chronically weakened, or that was the theory anyway. Instead, a team deprived of so many leading men trumped rivals who were at full strength and armed with greater experience and pedigree.

For a time, the ghosts of England’s record defeat in the same forbidding arena in 2013 appeared to be re-awakening, but this time Chris Robshaw and Co faced them down. This time, there was greater maturity and composed decision-making as the under-dogs turned the tables in ruthless fashion.

Jonathan Joseph’s wonderful solo try after half-time was the tipping point in this tense contest and by the end, England were threatening to pull significantly clear of their broken opponents. 

It was an emphatic reversal of the widely-anticipated script and will ignite a belief among Stuart Lancaster and his squad that this can be the catalyst for a compelling title challenge.

The magnitude of the outcome was clear to see from the reactions. High in the stand, Lancaster, Andy Farrell and Graham Rowntree embraced as euphoria swept the Red Rose coaching box. Down below, James Haskell’s first-pumping celebration symbolised the away team’s wild delight. He deserved to cavort with delight. The Wasps captain led England’s cavalry charge of defiance. His ball-carrying and defensive work-rate reached herculean heights.

Yet, the victors had several heroes. Joseph justified his recall with a conjuring act which was fully in keeping with his performances for Bath this season – when he scored after the break. 

Up front, Joe Marler delivered another imposing display and Dave Attwood was another Englishman who appeared to thrive amid the typical hostility. Most of all, there was a collective composure which showed that all the talk of progress since the last visit to these parts was more than mere hot air.

Taken in isolation, this was a high point of Lancaster’s tenure; a gallant triumph in the face of injury-induced adversity. 

In wider context, it will reverberate, not just through this championship but on into the World Cup. It would not have been upper-most in English minds before the game, but they will now feel that if they can conquer Wales in their capital, they can certainly see them off at Twickenham in their Pool A showdown.

For Warren Gatland, the second half last night was an alarming spectacle. His team were armed with their multitude of Lions and, despite often being short of attacking cohesion, they had gone into half-time 16-8 up. 

At home, with a fair share of territory and possession, they would have expected to kick on and lay the foundations for another fine campaign.

Instead, they will be condemned to a harsh inquest. 

The Welsh defence was exposed with worrying regularity, they were caught off-guard by their rivals’ intensity after half-time and perhaps the biggest concern for Gatland was that, among so many established Test figures, there were none of them who could arrest the slide from dominance to defeat.

Leigh Halfpenny’s first-minute penalty had set the hosts on their way and in the early stages, there was a sense of strong Welsh conviction and English jitters, and the one-way pressure kept building. Sure enough, the first try went to Wales.

The England pack delivered a strong shove at a scrum in their own 22, but their efforts were to no avail. 

Taulupe Faletau picked up and managed to hold off Haskell, then barged past George Ford before a sensational off-load sent Rhys Webb darting around Jonny May to score on the right. Halfpenny converted and the gap was up to double figures in the eighth minute.

Lancaster’s men needed to gain a foothold and they did so in the 15th minute. From a lineout drive, Ford and Ben Youngs probed for gaps before the ball was flung right. Luther Burrell passed on to Mike Brown and the full-back’s clever kick through created the opening for Anthony Watson, who pounced to touch down.

Unfortunately for England though, fly-half George Ford's conversion struck the post meaning the score was 10-5 in Wales' favour

Ford missed the conversion but was on target with another penalty. At the other end, as a disjointed contest became a stop-start kicking duel, Halfpenny landed his next penalty shot but missed another routine chance, before Dan Biggar’s drop goal sent Wales into half-time in good heart.

Their positive mood was shattered four minutes into the second half, as England hit back with a try which was a triumph for patient pressure and sustained force. The forwards softened up the Welsh defence on the left with a series of close-range drives, as the likes of Billy Vunipola, Chris Robshaw and the impressive Haskell made their presence felt.

When the ball was shifted in-field, Ford maintained the momentum and Joseph took a pass with several defenders in close attendance. However, the recalled Bath centre stepped around Biggar, shaped to release an over-head off-load and instead twisted past the flailing George North and broke away to score. It was just the sort of spark of creativity he had been selected for and the conversion by his club-mate, Ford, left the visitors just a point behind.

Just after the hour, the England No 10 added another penalty to put his side ahead for the first time and it was a deserved revival. Haskell came close to scoring late on and Attwood went over five minutes from time, but his ‘try’ was ruled out for obstruction by replacement Nick Easter earlier in the move. Ultimately, that decision was not decisive, as Ford held his nerve with a 79th -minute penalty to cap the comeback.

England’s players lingered for a lap of honour after the final whistle and Lancaster stopped to pose for pictures with delirious visiting supporters as he headed down the tunnel. It was that sort of night.
