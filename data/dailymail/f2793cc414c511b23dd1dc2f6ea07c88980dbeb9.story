A Manhattan sports memorabilia shop is selling a rare Babe Ruth rookie card for $695,000.

The 1914 card, which is believed to be one of only 10 still to exist, shows the baseball legend as a pitcher for a Baltimore pro team before he went on to the majors later that year.

'People love to collect, and it doesn't get better than this,' said Gotta Have It Collectibles president Pete Siegel.

'You can't go out there and ring a bell and get one of these things. These are for the people who have everything and can't find anything else,' he told the New York Post. 

The Gotta Have It website states: 'This is a 1914 Baltimore News Babe Ruth rookie card that pictures Ruth as an unknown minor-league rookie right out of St. Mary’s Industrial School for Boys. 

'Part of an obscure set of cards issued in Baltimore depicting stars of the city’s two professional baseball teams, the Terrapins of the Federal League and the Orioles of the International League of which Ruth is identified as a pitcher; the card posts the 1914 schedule of the Baltimore International League on the verso.' 

Mr Ruth became the first baseball player ever to hit 60 runs in one season (1927) and claimed 2,873 hits throughout his career

It is not clear how the shop came to acquire the red and white card.   

In July, a contract signed by Ruth with the Boston Red Sox in 1918 sold for $1.02 million at auction.

At the same auction his bat sold for $214,000, but the first baseball whacked over the Yankee Stadium fence by the legendary slugger failed to land a new home.

Ruth's bat was discovered in a stash of pre-World War I Red Sox bats found in a 150-year-old home outside Boston.

The bat sold  was used from 1916 to 1918, a period in which the left-handed pitcher helped the Red Sox win its last World Series for 86 years, a dry spell that ended in 2004. 

The initial item up for bid was the first ball ever hit out of the park by Ruth, who was trying out the Yankee Stadium field for a newspaper editor.

It had been expected to go for $1 million or more, but was withdrawn from the sale after it failed to attract even the minimum bid of $100,000. 

In February Ruth's pocket watch from the 1923 World Series sold for $717,000 at auction in New York City.

The pentagonal 14-karat gold watch was bought by a telephone bidder who is remaining anonymous, Heritage Auctions said. 

The watch is engraved with a picture of a pitcher, hitter and catcher and a ball in flight.

It is inscribed, "Presented by Baseball Commissioner to George H. Ruth."

Ruth entered Major League Baseball as a pitcher and outfielder for the Boston Red Sox in 1914.

He was traded to the New York Yankees in 1919, where he became the 'Sultan of Swat.' Setting the league record for home runs (714), slugging percentage (690) and runs batted (2,217), he was a beloved and brilliant player with humble beginnings.

Ruth was born on February 6, 1895, to German-American parents in Pigtown, a rough neighborhood of Baltimore, Maryland.

When he was just seven years old, his father sent him to St Mary's Industrial School for Boys. a reformatory and orphanage, and gave up custody of Mr Ruth. 

He was scouted while playing ball as a teenager and was quickly shuffled off to the Boston Red Sox and then the Yankees. 

Ruth became the first baseball player ever to hit 60 runs in one season (1927) and claimed 2,873 hits throughout his career. 

Ruth passed away at the age of 53 on August 16, 1948. 100,000 fans mourned his body when it was laid out at Yankee Stadium's entrance.
