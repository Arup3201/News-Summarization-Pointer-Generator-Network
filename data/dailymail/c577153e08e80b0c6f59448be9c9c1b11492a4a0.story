A shocking tuberculosis outbreak in a Texas hospital has now hit home for three more terrorized homes after a nurse's assistant was allowed to continue working with newborns for weeks after she began showing symptoms of the disease.

Eight babies have tested positive for TB following the August 21 discovery that a Providence Memorial Hospital nursery employee suffered from the active, highly contagious form of the disease, it was reported last week.

The revelation that the El Paso nurse had reported symptoms as far back as July has now become all the more disturbing as authorities have raised the number of infants possibly exposed to 860.

The unidentified hospital employee worked at Providence Memorial Hospital in El Paso. She potentially exposed 860 babies to TB, it was revealed last week

The Mantoux test is a widely used test for latent TB and is used on both adults and children.

It involves injecting a substance called PPD tuberculin into the skin of the forearm.

If the patient has latent TB infection, their skin will be sensitive to PPD tuberculin and a hard red bump will develop at the site of the injection, usually within 48 to 72 hours of having the test.

If they have a very strong skin reaction, they may need a chest X-ray to confirm whether they have an active TB infection.

If they do not have a latent infection, their skin will not react to the Mantoux test.

The infants who've tested positive all have a latent form of tuberculosis and have been offered treatment that will prevent them from becoming ill. 

El Paso Public Health Director Robert Resendes said Thursday that of the eight, five babies had been vaccinated previously against TB and their results may be false positives.  

The report from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services reveals that the nurse assistant on July 2 told others at Providence Memorial Hospital she was fatigued and coughing up blood. However, she didn't stop working until after her Aug. 15 shift and her private doctor diagnosed her with the active form of the disease on Aug. 21.

Dozens of the potentially infected babies came from nearby New Mexico. 

The hospital worker may have also exposed  about 40 other hospital workers starting all the way back in September 2013, said Dr. Hector Ocaranza, the health authority for El Paso County.

Ocaranza didn't say how the nursery worker may have contracted the disease, citing privacy laws.

Employment and medical records were reviewed to determine which infants and hospital workers may have been exposed.

Ocaranza noted that TB is treatable and said the possible exposure at the hospital doesn't represent a public health threat.

The discovery of the infected employee also prompted an inspection of the hospital by regulators, who found several violations that could threaten the hospital's Medicare funding and posed 'an immediate jeopardy to patient safety,' said David Wright, deputy regional administrator for the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services.

Wright declined to specify the violations, saying only that they were in the areas of infection control, patient rights and management oversight.

He also declined to say if the violations were related to the TB exposure. 

As of October, The hospital says it passed the first inspection by federal health authorities and inspectors will return in December. 

Bacterial scourge: The bacterial infection is spread through the air when someone sick with TB coughs or sneezes. The infected person must have the active form of the disease in order to be contagious

Tuberculosis was a major killer of humans and scourge to societies dating back to ancient Egypt. The potentially deadly disease of the lungs still rears its head today, so what should you know about TB?

Q: How is TB transmitted?

A: People with active TB, which travels through the air, can transmit the bacteria when they cough, sneeze or even speak. TB is unique because it remains airborne for prolonged periods of time, unlike the flu virus, which travels in droplets of fluid expelled from the body, according to David Dowdy, an epidemiology professor at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.

But the illness is hard to catch. Dowdy noted that it can only be spread by someone with active TB. Lee B. Richman, founder of the New Jersey Medical School Global Tuberculosis Institute in Newark, said TB also requires prolonged exposure. 

Q: What are the symptoms and how is TB treated?

A: Symptoms of active TB include muscle weakness and general sickness, weight loss, fever and night sweats. TB also usually includes coughing, chest pain or coughing up blood.

People infected with TB are given a four-drug treatment over 6 to 12 months. People who stop treatment or don't take the medication as prescribed may become sick again and cause the bacteria to become resistant to the drugs, creating a far more deadly microbe that is much harder to treat. 

Q: How prevalent is TB in the U.S.?

A: Last year, nearly 9,600 cases of active TB were reported in the U.S., and about 65 percent of those cases were among people born outside the U.S., according to the CDC. Most people living in the U.S. and areas with access to good health care will not die from TB if treated, though drug-resistant TB is more deadly.
