The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's one-year-old son Prince George has been revealed as eBay's top celebrity fashion icon and is credited with inspiring a huge surge in sales of items by British designer Cath Kidston.

The future King of England was photographed wearing one of the label's festive designs in his official Christmas portraits, which were published in late November, and it seems that the knitted vest prompted a massive increase in the number of bidders wanting to invest in their own pieces by the UK-based brand.

According to figures published by eBay and reported by WWD, bidders using the global auction site purchased more than 107,000 Cath Kidston pieces in the past 12 months, making the independent brand one of the most popular fashion labels on the site.

During the past 12 months, more than 450,000 tiaras have been bought by bidders using the online store, while tens of thousands of couture gowns were also successfully auctioned off. 

And while Prince George reigned as the website's most successful sartorial influencer, eBay's sales were also heavily influenced by some of the year's other most popular public figures, such as seflie queen Kim Kardashian and newlywed Amal Clooney. 

The beautiful Oscar de la Renta design worn by lawyer Amal at her wedding to actor George Clooney in September is believed to have inspired eBay users to purchase their own piece by the late designer and more than 11,000 de la Renta designs were sold through the site in the past year.

Kim Kardashian's wedding was also a popular source of inspiration among bidders.

Bizarrely, singer Pharrell Williams' now-infamous mountain hat, which was designed by Brit Vivienne Westwood, one of the year's more controversial fashion items, was also incredibly popular on the site in 2014.

Sales of similarly-designed hats increased by a staggering 43 per cent following Pharrell's first public outing in the style.

Unsurprisingly, merchandise inspired by Disney's hit film Frozen also ranked as one of the website's most popular purchasing themes.
