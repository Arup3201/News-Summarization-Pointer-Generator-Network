Suge Knight has been pictured for the first time since he was shot at Chris Brown's pre-VMA party nearly two weeks ago.

The 49-year-old music mogul headed out to Beverly Hills store Rochester Big & Tall on Friday, the first time he has been seen in public since being released from hospital where he was treated for six shotgun wounds.

Suge, real name Marion Hugh Knight Jr,Â  held some plaid shirts and a shopping bag as he left the store dressed in a black sweater, black and red spotted trousers and trainers.

Time for some new threads: Suge Knight seen for the first time since being shot six times going shopping in Beverly Hills at Rochester Big & Tall

Knight recently released graphic photos of his injured torso following an attack at a VMA pre-party in which he was shot six times.

In one of the pictures, five bullets holes can be seen in the rapper's back along with a large surgical wound where doctors opened him up to check for organ damage.

Fortunately, surgeons say none of his organs were harmed during the assault, according to TMZ.

Knight
 returned home from hospital last Wednesday as reports surfaced that 
investigators are looking at several 'people of interest' whose names 
or street monikers had come up in interviews, the New York Daily News reported.

The images were released after investigators said footage taken inside the LA nightclub where the attack took place shows Knight was targeted by the gunman.

Knight,
 49, was shot at a pre-VMA party hosted by Chris Brown at 1Oak in
 West Hollywood in the early hours of Sunday August 24.

Two others, including 19-year-old model Megan Hawkins, were also shot, and all three were rushed to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center.

'Video
 shows the suspect with a handgun firing at Knight [and] striking the 
two other victims who were in his vicinity,' Los Angeles County 
sheriff's Lt. John Corina told CBSLA.

After firing, the suspect started running for the exits alongside partygoers.

Corina added that he did not know if 
the two other victims, Hawkins and a 33-year-old man, were targeted. All
 three victims were expected to recover, authorities said.

Other
 video taken outside the club apparently show the music producer being 
led to a waiting police car by an armed officer as an ambulance arrives 
at the scene.

Sources
 claim he calmly 
walked outside and asked a cop for help before he was rushed to 
hospital.

Following the shooting, Knight's family recently issued a 
statement which read: 'The family of Suge Knight asks that you keep Suge
 in your prayers and to stray away from the negativity portrayed by the 
media.

'Suge is currently resting and has lost a lot of blood, he's 
human. He's done a lot of things for the community and the culture as a whole so we ask that you respect that.'

Knight, the co-founder of Death Row Records with Dr. Dre and the rapper The D.O.C., is no stranger to the effects of gun violence.

His friend Tupac Shakur was shot 
multiple times during a drive-by shooting in Las Vegas in 1996 - 
although during a previous visit to 1OAK, Knight told reporters that no 
one had ever been charged with Shakur's murder because he wasn't really 
dead, and was instead living on an island.

Knight also suffered a gunshot wound to the leg during a shooting at a 2005 pre-VMA party, hosted by rapper Kanye West.

In the moments after the gunfire, 
Brown was seen climbing onto a bar in the nightclub, apparently angrily 
remonstrating with other clubgoers as a bouncer told them to 'Get down'.

At around 5:45 a.m. LA time, Brown tweeted about the incident.

'It's
 disappointing that we as a society can#t have fun or enjoy ourselves 
without any altercations sometimes. Miss me with the bullsh*t!!!' he 
tweeted.
