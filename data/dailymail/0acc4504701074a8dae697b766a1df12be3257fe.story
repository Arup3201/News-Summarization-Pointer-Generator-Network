Russian secret services are probing whether exiled tycoon Boris Berezovsky is still alive after faking his death in England, according to an astonishing claim today.

The staunch enemy of Vladimir Putin is believed by British police to have committed suicide by hanging in a bathroom at an ex-wife's home in Ascot on March 23.

At the time, there was speculation in Britain that he could have been killed in a hit by Russian secret services, and in Moscow that MI5 could have behind his demise.

Conspiracy theory: A Russian newspaper published these images of how oligarch Boris Berezovsky might look in disguise as secret services confirmed they are investigating claims he may still be alive

Recent reports in Russia have cited sceptics claiming that his death was staged - possibly by British secret services.

And today a Moscow tabloid newspaper claims both the FSB, the country's domestic secret service, and the Investigative Committee, seen as equivalent of the FBI, are probing whether he is still alive.

The paper also published bizarre artist's impressions of what Berezovsky might look like in disguise.

'We are seriously considering a version that Berezovsky didn't die,' an anomymous special services source is quoted as saying by Komsomolskaya Pravda, a leading pro-Putin newspaper.

'Our staff have conducted certain investigations which gave us grounds to believe that he is alive.'

Enemies: Berezovsky fled Russia soon after Putin was elected Kremlin president in 2000, fearing arrest on charges he claimed were political

There was no immediate official comment today from the FSB and Investigative Committee.

Berezovsky, a scheming power behind the vodka throne of Boris Yeltsin, fled Russia soon after Putin was elected Kremlin president in 2000, fearing arrest on charges he claimed were political. Earlier Putin had been his protege.

Soon after Berezovsky's death, Putin said that he had received appeals from the tycoon to be allowed to return to Russia, evidently admitting his errors in calling from Britain for the strongman to be toppled.

'It was clear that Berezovsky didn't act alone, but with a help of security service specialists. We are working on versions that British or Israeli security services were involved in mocking it up,' the source was quoted as saying in Komsomolskaya Pravda.

Berezovsky's corpse was reported to have been found by his bodyguard who smashed down a bathroom door.

Unanswered questions: A police Forensic Investigation Unit on the road leading to Berezovsky's home, where his body was found in a bath on March 24. He is believed to have committed suicide

The source echoes other recent Russian reports in saying that no photographs have emerged of his corpse, and that his coffin was sealed at his May 8 burial, contrary to normal Russian Orthodox funerals.

'There were cases when I organised 'deaths' of people who were scared of revenge, and staged mock funerals,' he said.

 'They were very similar to Berezovsky's funeral, with a body in a closed casket, and with his close circle though dressed in mourning colours - in this case there were even mini-skirts -  walking with smiles on their faces.'

The colourful father of six was buried in Surrey reportedly with two ex-wives and two long term mistresses present as well as a number of glamorous lovers.

The report claimed that with his death, criminal cases against Berezovsky ceased 'as there is no-one to prosecute, so his wealth will not be taken away'.

In fact, however, the Russian government and others with claims against him are seeking compensation from his estate on what was left of the fortune of a mathematics professor turned business mogul who was his country's first billionaire after the collapse of the USSR.

At the time of his death, it was claimed that Berezovsky - who is believed to have held an Israeli passport in the past, and to have had British citizenship at the time of his death under the name Platon Elinen - had lost all his money.

A report by the Sunday Times last weekend claimed that in fact he was worth around £500 million.  In the week before he died, he replaced his will cutting out his first and second wives.
