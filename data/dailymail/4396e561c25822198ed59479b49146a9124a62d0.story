The woman who was tragically killed when her car washed away in flood waters in Maitland has been identified as an elderly great-grandmother who was popping out for milk.

The body of Anne Jarmain, 86, was found at 7pm on Wednesday; 10 hours after her car was pulled off the road and underwater as she tried to crossed Cessnock Road, which in the NSW Hunter Region.

Her family and friend are in shock, with her neighbours lamenting that they could not convince the sweet, 'strong-willed' woman to stay at home.

After two days without power and with limited food supplies, Ms Jarmain insisted on making a 'quick trip' into town.

'We sent over (some hot water to her) at 7.30am and that's when she said she said she was going into town,' her neighbour of 12 years, Kath Wilkinson told the Newcastle Herald.

'She had said she would have loved to go and visit Jim (her husband), who is in a nursing home, but she knew she wouldn't be able to.

'We told her she didn't need to go, but she yelled out to (my husband) Geoff to thank him when she left,' Ms Wilkinson explained.

Ms Jarmain was dragged into the waters when she tried to manoeuvre her silver hatchback around a stalled Falcon before 9am on Wednesday.

Around ten people immediately ran into the water, with four people stripping off and swimming frantically through the icy, fast-moving water.

Ms Jarmain's son, Trevor says he is very moved by the efforts of bystanders to help.

Ms Jarmain was a beloved mother of three; Trevor, Robert and Jennifer and treasured grandmother and great-grandmother to many.

'She was healthy and active and very strong willed,' Trevor told Fairfax.

'She was an avid bowler and was a member of the Telarah Bowling Club.

'She will be sadly missed.'

Anne Jarmain loved bowls, feeding the magpies on her veranda and her husband, Jim.

The Premier is touring flood damaged areas in NSW as thousands remain effected by fierce storms which battered Sydney and the Hunter earlier this week

NSW Premier Mike Baird is touring the area and says he is shocked at the devastation caused by flooding in the Hunter. 

The Premier admits it will be a long time before victims are back on their feet.

'Homes, cattle, this whole landscape has been completely and utterly devastated,' Mr Baird said in Maitland after a helicopter tour of the region.

'I was in shock... at the size and scale of what we are confronting.'

The state's worst storms in a decade have ripped through Sydney and surrounding areas this week with four deaths in the Hunter region.

'I don't think many of us can imagine circumstances where our life is literally washed away,' Mr Baird said on Thursday.

'Personal possessions, all your memories are lost in an instant.'

The clean-up bill will run into the hundreds of millions of dollars and would take time, he said at SES headquarters in Metford.

There are up to 2000 people stranded in the Hunter due to high waters.

Provisions including baby formula, food and medication were being being ferried to people who are stranded in Gilliston Heights, near Maitland.

'Patience is going to be a big part of the next few days and weeks,' the premier said.

It will be a long time before storm-battered victims get back on their feet, he said.

The SES has responded to more than 14,000 requests for assistance since Sunday.

SES Commissioner Adam Dent urged bosses to remain flexible in coming days, despite the clearer skies.

'It's often when the rain stops and perhaps when less images are on TV that people take the focus away from our work, we still need to work for several days to come,' he said. 

The devastation in the Hunter has ended lives, destroyed homes and ruined countless possessions
