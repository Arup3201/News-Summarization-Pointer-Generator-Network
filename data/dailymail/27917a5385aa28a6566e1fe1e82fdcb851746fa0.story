Jason Lewis has been jailed after his friend Tom Baynton died in a car crash caused when Lewis bent down to pick up his mobile phone while driving

A young driver has been jailed after he killed his best friend in a car crash after bending down to pick up his phone.

Jason Lewis, 23, took his eyes off the road after dropping his phone under the pedals of his Peugeot 106 as he drove along a road in Ebbw Vale, South Wales.

He lost control of the car as he twice tried to retrieve the phone and was in a head-on collision which killed his passenger and best friend, Tom Baynton.

A court heard his car somersaulted onto its roof after the collision, which instantly killed popular footballer Mr Baynton, 21.

Mr Baynton, who was in the front passenger seat, was awaiting the birth of his first child with partner Ella when the tragedy happened.

A passenger in the other car, pensioner Rosalyn Webb, 66, was so badly injured in the crash she was in a coma for weeks and two other passengers were also injured.

The court heard that Lewis, who escaped serious injury, had drunk two and a half pints of lager earlier that day, which had affected his driving even though he was under the legal limit.

He was jailed for three years and nine months for causing death and serious injury by dangerous driving.

Prosecutor Michael Jones said: 'He told police that his mobile phone slipped off the centre console, landing and getting stuck under the clutch pedal.

'In attempting to retrieve it he bent down and when he reached down a second time he lost his bearings and through panic lost control of the car.'

Lewis' lawyer told the court that the young driver, who sat with head bowed for most of the proceedings, had shown 'heartfelt and genuine remorse'.

She said: 'He made a terrible mistake and will have to live with the consequences for ever.'

Mr Baynton - described as a 'true legend who loved life' by friends - died instantly in the accident last year

The court heard that six weeks after the tragedy, which happened in November 2013, Mr Baynton's partner gave birth to his baby son Leo.

Lewis, of Abergavenny, Gwent, admitted both charges at Cardiff Crown Court.

Judge Neil Bidder told him: 'You foolishly bent down to pick up the phone and repeated the action taking your eyes off the road.

'It was a crass thing to do and led to a terrible waste of life which was entirely avoidable.

'Although you were not over the drink driving limit you had consumed enough alcohol to have impaired your judgement.

'It is a great tragedy for the family of Mr Baynton who died never seeing his baby son and having a son who will never know his father.'
