Kentucky Republican Senator Mitch McConnell is poised to take over control of the upper house of Congress in January, but his mild-mannered governing style won't include a push to repeal the Obamacare health insurance overhaul law completely.

'If I had the ability, obviously I'd get rid of it,' he told reporters at the University of Louisville political institute that bears his name on Wednesday, in a press conference that ended in a rare round of applause.

And 'it's no secret that every one of my members thinks Obamacare was a huge legislative mistake,' he jabbed

McConnell did preview some targeting of a few of the Affordable Care Act's more vexing provisions, however – including 'pieces of it that are tremendously unpopular with the American people.'

He singled out a medical device tax that he said has driven jobs overseas, the individual health insurance mandate, and a 50-full-time-employee compliance threshold that has pushed hundreds of thousands of employers to cut workers' hours and alter 'the 40-hour work week' with temporary hires.

IN CONTROL: Mitch McConnell, the soon-to-be-anointed US Senate Majority Leader, fielded question Wednesday about jobs, Obamacare, trade, energy, government shutdowns and immigration 

DOLDRUMS: President Barack Obama, shown Tuesday at a White House meeting on the Ebola crisis, has been backed into a corned by a Republican sweep, left with only a veto pen in his bag of tricks

'These are the kinds of things that I believe there is a bipartisan majority in the Senate to approve,' he told TIME magazine.

Stripping the individual mandate out of Obamacare, however, would likely have the same effect as killing the law entirely.

Without a legal requirement that Americans have health insurance, there's not likely to be enough money in the system to subsidize government-funded Medicare and other benefits for Americans who can't afford to buy insurance policies.

All seven Republicans who won previously Democratic Senate seats on Tuesday campaigned heavily on an Obamacare repeal.

McConnell also told TIME that winning approval for the controversial Keystone XL oil pipeline would be part of his first to-do list.

'We haven't had an energy bill in seven years,' he lamented during his Wednesday press conference.

McConnell was cautious on Wednesday in predicting how he would work with President Barack Obama, a staunch liberal whose policies were largely repudiated Tuesday night.

'The veto pen is a pretty powerful tool,' McConnell admitted, but he said trade issues and tax reform could help the two pols meet in the middle despite conservative tea partiers' instincts to resist cooperating. 

'What's exporting jobs is having the highest corporate tax rate in the industrialized world,' he said. 

McConnell spoke on the phone with Obama before he talked to reporters, and suggested that the White House was willing to roll up its sleeves – and that the president was nearly as frustrated with Harry Reid's Senate slow-walking leadership as Republicans were. 

'The House passed over 300 pieces of legislation' in the last two years, he claimed, 'many on a bipartisan basis, and nothing was done with them in the Senate. We're going to go back to work and actually pass legislation.'

And Obama, he said, told him: 'Send us trade agreements. We're interested in looking at them.'

McConnell told reporters he would adopt the Cold War negotiating strategy of 'Trust but verify.'

'We'll see if we can work with the president,' he said. 'I hope so. ... we'll find out.'

And ultimately, 'there's only one Democrat who counts: the president. ... Democrats in Congress will support whatever he agrees to do.'

CRUSHED: Kentucky Secretary of State Alison Lundergan Grimes was a distant second in Tuesday's election, handing McConnell another term in the Senate – and the keys to the highest office in Congress

Asked how he planned to respond to the Obama's promised unilateral action on immigration, the newly minted Senate leader pointed to congressional budgeting.

'The way that you push back on executive overreach is through the funding process,' he told TIME. 'We’re going to pass a budget. We’re going to pass appropriations bills.'

'Appropriations bills are going to have prescriptions of certain things that we think he ought not to be doing by either reducing the funding or restricting the funding.'

He put it more crisply on Wednesday, saying the Republican-led Senate would 'use the power of the purse to push back.'

Obama is expected to announce soon a dramatic overhaul of immigration policy that could include a temporary amnesty for millions of illegal immigrants.

While he lacks the power to redefine the requirements for legal resident status without help from Congress – now a practical impossibility with the GOP in charge – the president can halt deportations and even issue green cards and work permits that would be in effect until the end of his term in office.

In order to pull that off, however, the Department Homeland Security would need funding from Capitol Hill.

DHS recently invited contractors to bid on a project that would enable the agency to create as many as 34 million new documents to help illegal immigrants mainstream themselves into American society.

GOP leaders were wary on Wednesday about Obama's intentions.

Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus told reporters that 'The president has consistently lied to the American people ... on immigration reform.'

He promised an all-out push to generate public support for his party's priorities. 

But McConnell's biggest challenge – on Obamacare, immigration and other key issues – could be the thought of working closely with tea party conservatives in his own caucus.

He was standoffish with his fellow Kentuckian Rand Paul in 2010 during election season as the right-winger squared off against a McConnell-favored moderate in the Republican primary.

Once Paul prevailed and became the GOP's candidate, however, McConnell was in the mood to make friends.

McConnell himself faced a tea party challenger this year, and it was Paul who helped him restore his street cred among conservatives.

Texas Sen. Ted Cruz will be another thorn in the new majority leader's side. He has said he plans to agitate for a wholesale Obamacare repeal, likely an empty gesture as the president holds a veto pen.

TIME asked the senator about the possibility of a government shutdown if Obama holds fast on his policies and Republicans push back with threats to cut off funding on a large scale.

'No. There is no possibility of a government shutdown,' McConnell said. 

'Remember me?' he laughed. 'I’m the guy that gets us out of government shutdowns.'
