When he’s not missing sitters, Arsenal adore him. When they’re not jeering and cheering the decision to replace him, the fans like nothing more than belting out his name to the tune of 'Hey Jude'.

Olivier Giroud’s world is a little mixed up right now, but it is never boring. Having missed three months of the campaign with a broken ankle, he is making up for lost time by cramming in the emotions.

On Boxing Day, there was the daft red card against Queen’s Park Rangers for butting Nedum Onuoha and there was last week against Monaco.

Giroud was guilty of missed good chances in the first leg of the Champions League tie and took the blame was his side lost 3-1 at home.

It is hard to see them getting out of that particular fix, but he has set about making amends for a poor display by getting back in the goals. 'He is strong mentally,' said manager Arsene Wenger. 'He can take criticism and respond.'

Giroud was on target against Everton on Sunday and opened the scoring in the 64th minute at Loftus Road last night with his 13th goal of the season, one which gave Arsenal control of this lively London derby.

Alexis Sanchez added the second, his first in eight games, and Wenger eased three points closer to the total of 72 he thinks will be required to be safely back in the Champions League next season.

As for QPR, the relegation woes deepen and it is beginning to look ominous for them at the bottom.

They may have enjoyed a sunshine break in the Middle East but they returned to London to find the gulf was still as it was, even though Charlie Austin pulled a goal back with a terrific strike on the turn, eight minutes from time.

Austin must hope England boss Roy Hodgson had not gone home early. Other than that, QPR were left with nothing to show for a spirited performance and a bold opening.

They were the better team during a high-tempo first half-hour, hustling in midfield, and attacking Arsenal’s centre-halves in the air.

It was physical at times. Kieran Gibbs was felled by a stray elbow from Bobby Zamora as the pair jostled for a ball in the air, but no foul was given and there was no obvious intent. Gibbs was able to continue.

Onuoha was forced off in the first-half and this time Giroud was not the problem but Steven Caulker. The team-mates clashed heads and Onuoha was left with cut near his left eye.

Per Mertesacker and Gabriel Paulista coped well with QPR’s initial aerial attack, and goalkeeper David Ospina commanded his area well during this period. Gabriel limped off before half-time with a hamstring strain, and Wenger fears he may be out for three weeks.

QPR went into this game having not won in nine London derbies. They have another chance to stop the rot on Saturday against Spurs. 

Austin was the only real threat, looking sharp and hungry around the fringes of the penalty box and quick on draw, striking the ball cleanly and forcing saves from Ospina. He went close with a flashing drive from 20 yards, which faded an inch or two wide.

Ramsey’s team, however, could not find the goal which might have galvanised them and, as the first half wore on, they faded. Arsenal enjoyed more comfortable possession and Rob Green came under threat for the first time. Green responded with three solid saves to frustrate Giroud and one to deny Santi Cazorla.

Wenger’s team came out with more urgency and purpose after the interval. 'It was important to get the ball on the ground, not only fight but fight and play,' said the Arsenal boss. 'In the second half, we did that. We fought and played.'

Tomas Rosicky set the tone, tearing past Sandro to deliver a cross from the right which clipped Mesut Ozil on the shin and flew clear. Ozil callled for a penalty and the replays suggested he had a strong case.

Karl Henry pull him by the shirt. It went unseen and Henry, having been booked in the first-half, escaped.

Just as Arsenal started to wonder if it might be one of those days, Giroud pounced. An overlap and low cross from Gibbs was blocked by Clint Hill and, when it spilled his way, the French centre-forward reacted swiftly to turn it past Green from an acute angle.

The second came from the same area. This time, it was Sanchez who, having come to life after the interval, jinked inside from the left, dummied, jinked again and screwed a low shot into the bottom corner.

For Sanchez, it was the 19th of his debut season in England and, if Green was annoyed to be beaten at his near-post, he then produced the save of the night, pushing a deflecting low drive from Ozil onto the post.

Austin pulled one back, his 15th of the season, but it was the Arsenal fans who filed out into the streets of Shepherd’s Bush singing Giroud’s name, while QPR fans went home fearing their time in the Barclays Premier League might be ticking away.

'We’re in a pressure situation,' said Ramsey. 'We need to start winning to stay in the division.'
