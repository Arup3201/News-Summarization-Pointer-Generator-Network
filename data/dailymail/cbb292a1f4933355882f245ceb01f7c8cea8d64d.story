Formation 4-1-3-2 – I’d be bold and adventurous and it would mean England either take the tournament by storm or go out in a blaze of glory as one of the best teams never to win the World Cup.

                                                                Joe Hart 

Glen Johnson             Phil Jagielka              Gary Cahill            Leighton Baines                                                 

                                                  Steven Gerrard

          Raheem Sterling                Ross Barkley                    Adam Lallana

                               Wayne Rooney            Daniel Sturridge

Go for broke: Adam Lallana should start in England's opening World Cup game against Italy

The future: The talented Ross Barkley (left) must be allowed to shine in South America

The weak link is Glen Johnson, but if he can do something special – like this goal for example, then that will make up for his obvious defensive shortcomings.

The key to this formation being a success over the Italians lies in the three – Sterling, Barkley and Lallana - being so energetic that they give Andrea Pirlo the kind of nightmares that make him think about retiring from football.

He won’t be able to pass a ball after being given the runaround by those three. They will also energise and inspire Wayne Rooney, who is a striker with an incredible goalscoring record.

He slows down in the No 10 role or out wide, so play him up front with another goal machine Daniel Sturridge – they score goals, and goals win matches. It’s not rocket science.

Right-back: Liverpool defender Glen Johnson could be England's weak link in Manaus

Goal machine: Wayne Rooney must play up front with Daniel Sturridge to take the game to Italy
