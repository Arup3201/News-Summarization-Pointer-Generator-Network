Britain's last Olympic gold-medal winning 4x100m relay team came back together this week, a decade after their phenomenal achievement in Athens.

Jason Gardener, Darren Campbell, Marlon Devonish and Mark Lewis-Francis won the Olympic title in 2004, pipping the much-fancied American team into second place.

And the four sprinters reunited on Tuesday to help disadvantaged children get into sport, as part of the London 2012 Olympic legacy.

The Olympic champions took part in a variety of everyday volunteering roles at Battersea Summer Scheme in order to highlight the important roles that volunteer play in community sport.

The quartet helped children try out a number of sports including archery, mini golf and athletics before demonstrating their prowess on the track.

The event was part of the Join In Summer Relay, which will see British stars and top athletes muck in with the everyday volunteer roles that make sport possible in the UK.

Devonish spoke at the event about the importance of volunteers in his career.

'My very first coach was a volunteer and I was with him for 7 years, he laid the foundation for my success,' said Devonish, who also won Gold medals at the Commonwealth games and World Indoor Championships during his sprinting career.
