Anderlecht coach Besnik Hasi accused Arsenal of treating his team like second class citizens after their incredible comeback at the Emirates.

The Belgian champions came back from 3-0 down to draw 3-3 with Arsene Wenger’s team with a last-minute goal from Aleskander Mitrovic.

Wenger did not shake hands with Hasi at the final whistle and the Anderlecht coach claimed he could not care less.

Hasi said: ‘It doesn’t hurt me if I don't get his hand. We come from a small competition but we just imagine playing these teams.

‘In these two games against Arsenal we deserve more than just one point.

‘Maybe Arsenal wanted to have fun with their public. I am honoured to have coached my team.

‘At 3-0 you either say the game is over and let them score the fourth or fifth or you make changes.

‘At 3-1 we grew in confidence and I have to thank our fans tonight. Even at 3-0 down they gave confidence to the team. Our players got into the rhythm again.

‘Arsenal played the same way throughout: They tried to score a fourth and at 3-2 you see Arsenal start to have a bit of doubt.’
