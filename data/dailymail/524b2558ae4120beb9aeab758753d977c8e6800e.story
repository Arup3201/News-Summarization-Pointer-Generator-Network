You can lead a horse to water... or indeed, 150 wild ponies, and then watch them swim.

This was the scene on the Eastern Shore of Virginia yesterday as a herd of the animals made their way across the Assateague Channel.

Thousands of spectators watched as the young horses found their sea legs during the 88th Annual Chincoteague Pony Swim.

Thousands of spectators watched as the young horses found their sea legs during the 88th Annual Chincoteague Pony Swim

Just as the wild ponies entered the water to swim across the half-mile passage - herded by 'Saltwater' cowboys - the heavens opened, unleashing a torrent of rain

Confronted with the highest tide in recent memory, onlookers waded through marshland, while others took to kayaks, to get a good view.

And just as the wild ponies entered the water to swim across the half-mile passage - herded by 'Saltwater' cowboys (many of whom are volunteer firefighters) - the heavens opened, unleashing a torrent of rain.

Undeterred, the 'sea horses' made it safely to the shore in just over five minutes, according to Eastern Shore News.

During the pony swim, which has occurred since 1925, the animals are kept safe from any strong currents

Every year, the wild ponies are rounded up on the national wildlife refuge to be auctioned off by the Chincoteague Volunteer Fire Company, which looks after the Virginia herd

The short burst of stormy weather 
stopped in time for the pony parade carnival, which saw them trek two 
miles down the street to their corral.

Every year, the wild ponies are rounded up on the national wildlife refuge to be auctioned off by the Chincoteague Volunteer Fire Company, which looks after the Virginia herd.

Ponies that are not sold and those that are donated back to the fire department will roam free for another year at the refuge.

During the pony swim, which has occurred since 1925, the animals are kept safe from any strong currents.

Afterwards, visitors can attend the Chincoteague Carnival.

The auction takes place before the ponies swim back to Assateague Island later this week.

The carnival tradition began when the town of Chincoteague found itself in need of fire equipment in order to protect itself.

Several devastating fires had occurred during the early 1900s, and since Chincoteague Island was isolated from the mainland with no bridges, the town needed protection.

They were able to raise money for fire equipment by holding the pony auction.

The swim and auction also help to manage the number of wild horses on Assateague and prevent them from adversely impacting on the sensitive barrier island ecology.                                                                                                                      Source: www.assateagueisland.com
