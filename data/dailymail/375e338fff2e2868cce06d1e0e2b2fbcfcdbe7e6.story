After upsetting the odds one week, it’s always good to back it up the following one — and Stoke managed that yesterday as they escaped south London with a point.

Crystal Palace aren’t in the class of Arsenal, who Stoke beat last Saturday, but they defended stoutly, worked as a unit and forced Mark Hughes’s side into areas they did not wish to be.

At times the Potters couldn’t live with their hosts, or more pointedly with Yannick Bolasie, who gave Phil Bardsley a real chasing.

In Bolasie, Neil Warnock has an individual who could be the difference between Palace and the rest of the sides towards the bottom of the division. The barometer for Stoke is not how they fare against the likes of the Gunners in the Britannia Stadium but on awkward trips such as this. They passed the test, just.

‘We have to be reasonably pleased with an away point,’ Hughes said. ‘Last week was fantastic, but credit to Palace, they asked questions of us. The pitch wasn’t great and we would like to have produced more.’

Bolasie shone brightly, coping well with the hype around him. 

McArthur drew another smart save from Begovic with a curling effort from outside the box as he produced a display more reminiscent of his Wigan days under Roberto Martinez.

‘It was good for McArthur to get a goal — we need more from other areas. He complements the set-up and helps Yannick,’ Warnock said.

Bolasie was the one to catch the eye. The 25-year-old admits he needs to be more productive — chiefly to chip in with extra goals — but his manager was delighted with his directness and his final ball here. Bolasie’s crosses are certainly hitting the mark on a more regular basis. He should be off to the Africa Cup of Nations next month with Congo and Palace are sure to miss him.

For now, there are games to be won and Bolasie is the man to secure results.

Warnock isn’t worried about suitors in next month’s transfer window. ‘It doesn’t matter how much anyone offers us,’ he said. ‘He won’t be going anywhere in January.’

It didn’t take him long to make a telling contribution. After 11 minutes, he sauntered down the left and flighted a cross for James McArthur to flick home.

The unusually quiet Selhurst Park crowd rose from their slumber, but only briefly.

Stoke were level just over a minute later. Jon Walters wasn’t picked up and his blocked effort found its way to the inexplicably unmarked Peter Crouch — standing to attention at the back post — who did the rest.

The gangly striker might have won it with only moments remaining but couldn’t get enough power into his volley.

Warnock’s side enjoyed the best of it, Stoke seemingly out of sorts and incapable of dealing with Bolasie’s pace and trickery. McArthur had the taste for more, stinging Asmir Begovic’s palms after a clever reverse pass from the left winger, while Wilfried Zaha’s low shot almost crept inside a post.
