As St. Clairsville High football star Michael Ferns raced towards the end zone there was nothing in front of him but his 12th touchdown of the season.

So fans were all the more shocked when the Ohio teen stopped only one yard from the end zone, and purposely stepped out of bounds.

The only people who weren’t confused were his team-mates, who immediately understood that Ferns had just sacrificed glory so that a teammate could honour his recently passed father.

Tragedy: Only two days before his football game, Logan Thompson's father Paul died of a stroke at 44

Just two days before the team’s game against Edison High, Logan Thompson, a devoted freshman varsity player who’d never played in a single game, had lost his father to a stroke at age 44.

Thompson’s father, Paul, has suffered the stroke while unconscious in the bathroom as his sons got ready for school.

Logan battered down the door with a baseball bat to get to him and the paramedics came, Paul was sadly pronounced dead at a local hospital.

‘In that instant, Logan stopped being a kid,’ his mother, Daniele, told ESPN. ‘He made grown-up decisions. In the blink of an eye his world changed and he went from being and adolescent to a young man.’

Teammates: Star player Michael Fern knew how devoted Thompson¿s family was to football and wanted to find a way to ease his teammate's suffering

Before the visitation or the funeral, Logan had a football game to attend.

Though Logan typically spent his varsity games on the bench, he knew his father would’ve wanted him to go.

Until the last quarter of the October 5 game, the time passed like any other game for Logan, supporting his team from the sidelines.

Unbeknown to Logan, the team’s coach Brett McLean had secretly urged his top players to stop short of the end zone if they had a chance, allowing grieving freshman a chance to final score.

Michael Fern: With only one yard to the end zone, Fern stepped out of bounds stopping the game and setting up Logan Thompson for his first touchdown

The plan was almost foiled by two referees, who at first ruled that Fern had actually scored a touchdown.

They finally relented after teammates came rushing on to the field to protest their own touchdown.

As the team regrouped, McLean yelled for Logan.

‘You’re going in at running back,’ McLean told him. ‘Tell them to run 26 Power.’

When the boy, a linebacker who only rarely played wide receiver, looked at his couch in shock, McLean offered some last words of encouragement before sending him on to the field.

Bench warming: Logan, a freshman who'd never scored a touchdown, spent most games on the sidelines until his teammates executed their plan

‘It’s easy,’ he said. ‘Just follow Michael Ferns’ big butt.’

On the next play Thompson was given the ball and darted straight into the end zone through a five-yard gap between the right guard and tackle.

‘It felt like slow motion,’ Thompson told reporters. ‘I saw this humongous hole. I don’t think our line has blocked this well all season.’

Ferns went to Thompson and hugged him.

Shocked: Fans who's never seen Logan's number 17 jersey on the field had no idea what to make of the last second entrant

At one end zone St. Clairsville principal Walt Skaggs broke down while at the other At the other McLean was wiping away tears.

In the stands, Logan’s brother, Landen, texted Daniele: ‘Mom, Logan scored a touchdown.’

‘Looking straight up into the sky after scoring my first varsity touchdown’ Thompson later wrote on Twitter. ‘I know the old man was watching! Love and miss you so much daddy.’
