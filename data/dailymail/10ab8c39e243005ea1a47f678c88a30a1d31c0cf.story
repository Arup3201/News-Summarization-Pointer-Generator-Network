Do you worry too much about the calories in your morning latte? Choose salad over a sandwich to avoid the bread? Get the calculator out over dinner to work out if you've hit 2,000 yet?

Don't fret. You're probably not alone.

The average woman spends almost one entire year of her life obsessing about calories and fretting about her weight, according to new research.

Women spend almost a year of their lives counting calories and worrying about their weight during lifetime... but men aren't far behind

Women typically think about or talk about their diets for around 21 minutes per day, or over two hours every single week.

That means they fret about their size for 127 hours a year, which over 67 years of an average adult lifetime equates to around 355 days. Almost one year

By contrast men spend 18 minutes a day or 109 hours a year thinking about calories, which equates to 304 days of their lives - fewer, but not that far behind.

What's more, half of us claim to be unhappy with our weight, and manage what we eat by monitoringÂ  calories.

The average adult spends 338 days of their life calorie-counting - that equates to 20 minutes a day, over two hours a week and an average of 121 hours per year checking labels for calorie content, talking about calories or thinking about calories.

And it's not just women who are trying to tackle the calorie war: nearly two fifths (38 per cent) of men admit checking the back of packets for dietary information in a bid to stay slim.

The research also highlighted that keeping trim for loved ones is the main driver for people calorie counting, with over a third of those surveyed (38 per cent) reported wanting to lose weight to make their partner happy.

Nearly one in ten (nine per cent) watch their calories so they can be as slim as their friends.

Office workers can't escape the calories either, with one in fourteen admitting to reading labels to look good in front of trim colleagues.

Advances in technology mean we're calorie counting around the clock, with over a fifth of Brits reporting they use a smartphone app to keep track of the calories they're consuming, while nearly one in ten use a specialist website to monitor their calorie intake.

One in six dieters stick with an old fashioned pen and pencil and keep a food diary.

The survey also revealed Brits find calorie counting tough, with nearly a third admitting they find monitoring calories time-consuming.

Fiona Hope of SodaStream, 
which commissioned the study, said: 'Counting calories is a part of 
modern day life and our research shows Brits are obsessed with watching 
their weight. It's important to offer people choice as part of a well-balanced diet.'
