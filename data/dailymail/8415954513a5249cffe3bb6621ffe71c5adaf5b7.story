After Cristiano Ronaldo caused a stir  by letting out a scream in celebration after winning the Ballon d'Or, the Real Madrid forward has taken to greeting fans in the same way.

The Portugal international was stopped in the street by an elderly supporter looking to have his picture taken with the star, before the pair let out the iconic scream in each other's direction.

Ronaldo explained after the Ballon d'Or ceremony that the celebration was one that he often performs in training with his Real Madrid team-mates.

'The scream? The players know I always do that shout when I score a goal or when we win - it's our team shout,' Ronaldo told a Spanish TV station.

It was later revealed that Ronaldo was shouting 'Siiiii' and the forward now uses the scream to celebrate all his goals.

Ronaldo won his third Ballon d'Or earlier this month, beating off competition from Lionel Messi and Manuel Neuer.
