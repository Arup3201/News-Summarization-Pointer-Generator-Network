Miley Cyrus has denied rumours of a budding romance with Justin Beiber after they were pictured together at a club in Los Angeles.

The pair, who have known each other for years, were spotted at Beacher's Madhouse at the Roosevelt Hotel over the weekend with onlookers telling TMZ they engaged in 'hardcore flirting' before leaving together around 2am.

But the 20-year-old shot down the speculation and insisted her rocky engagement to Liam Hemsworth is still on.

When asked if she was dating the 19-year-old on Tuesday, she said: 'I’m engaged! I’m engaged. That is impossible.'

During a morning interview on Washington DC radio program The Kane Show, Miley was also asked about Amanda Bynes, who this week branded the star 'ugly' in yet another Twitter rant.

(The troubled actress also recently revealed she has eyes for Miley's fiance, branding him 'most gorgeous man on the face of the earth.')

Miley responded: 'I won’t even entertain that thought.

'I think it’s all so sad, that I don’t want to add any fuel to that fire. Because it’s really so sad to me.'

'I
was rooting for her comeback until she started attacking me, and I just
thought it was hilarious that she mentioned my name the moment I was 
the worldwide trending topic on Twitter.

She
concluded: 'It's just funny the moment you're a trending topic how many
people want your name to come out of their mouth, so somehow they can 
associate and maybe they can become a trending topic.'

Miley is currently promoting her new single, We Can't Stop.
