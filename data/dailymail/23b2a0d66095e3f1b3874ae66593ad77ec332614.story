When a stream of mucus oozed out of KTVU's Heather Holmes during a live cross, she was left with only one option - to lick it up.

The seasoned professional was coming to the end of a report on Miley Cyrus's concert in Oakland, San Francisco on Monday night when slime began gushing from her nose.

It wasn't long before the stringy goo settled on her lip, forcing her to swallow it and continue the broadcast.Â 

The funny but vomit-inducing clip has 
gone viral on social media, with most sharers noticing the comedic 
synchronicity of Holmes's script and dripping nose.

She posted a picture of herself holding a box of tissues on Twitter with the caption: 'Note to self: Next time bring #Kleenex.'
