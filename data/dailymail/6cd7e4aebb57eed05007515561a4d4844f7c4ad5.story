A 24-year-old Japanese businessman is under investigation after he fathered at least 16 babies with surrogate mothers in Thailand.

Mitsutoki Shigeta is at the heart of a multinational probe by Interpol after nine of this children were discovered in a 'baby factory' in an upmarket district of Bangkok.

Police raiding the flat found the nine babies living with nine paid nannies in a few rooms furnished only with bouncy chairs and play pens, and packed with baby bottles and nappies.

They have since identified Mr Shigeta as the father of seven other babies.

'What I can tell you so far is that I've never seen a case like this,' said police Major General Apichart Suribunya, director of Interpol in Thailand.

'We are trying to understand what kind of person makes this many babies.'

Maj Gen Apichart said Interpol offices in Japan, Cambodia, Hong Kong and India have been asked to probe Mr Shigeta's background.

Police say he appears to have registered businesses or apartments in those countries and has frequently travelled there. No charges have been brought against him.

Police Lieutenant General Kokiat Wongvorachart, Thailand's lead investigator in the case, said he and his colleagues were looking into two motives: 'One is human trafficking and the other is exploitation of children.'

He said Mr Shigeta made 41 trips to Thailand since 2010. On many occasions he travelled to nearby Cambodia, where he took four of his babies.

In the meantime, Mr Shigeta is trying to get his children back. The 12 in Thailand are being cared for by social services - and he has proven through DNA samples sent from Japan that he is their biological father.

He quickly left Thailand after the August 5 raid on the flat and has said through a lawyer that he simply wanted a large family and has the means to support it.

Mr Kokiat said Mr Shigeta hired 11 Thai surrogate mothers to carry his children, including four sets of twins. Police have not determined the biological mothers.

'As soon as they got pregnant, he requested more,' said Mariam Kukunashvili of the New Life clinic, which operates in Thailand and six other countries.

'He said he wanted 10 to 15 babies a year, and that he wanted to continue the baby-making process until he's dead,' she said, adding that he had also inquired about equipment to freeze his sperm.

As for Mr Shigeta's motives, she said he told the clinic's manager that 'he wanted to win elections and could use his big family for voting,' and that 'the best thing I can do for the world is to leave many children'.

The father of 16 surrogate babies discovered by police in Thailand invested money in a mobile app to monitor the movements of your children.

Mitsutoki Shigeta is understood to have a 4 per cent stake in Hamburg-based Familonet, whose technology automatically alerts parents about the movements of their children.

The South China Morning Post reported that Familonet has since taken down photos of Mr Shigeta from its Facebook page and said it had 'initiated precautionary actions to suspend him as an investor.'

Ms Kukunashvili is based at her company's headquarters in Georgia, and said she never met Mr Shigeta but received reports from her Thai staff.

She said she sent faxes in English and French in April last year to Interpol's head office in Lyon, France, and an email through the agency's website, but they went unanswered.

Maj Gen Apichart said his office in Thailand never saw the warnings.

She also sent Mr Shigeta an email to express suspicion, and lawyer Ratpratan Tulatorn responded on his behalf in an August 31 2013 email.

The lawyer said Mr Shigeta was involved in 'no dishonesty, no illegal activities'. He said his client hoped to keep using New Life, but the company then stopped working with him.

Mr Shigeta's activities remained discreet until early this month, when an Australian couple was accused of abandoning a baby with his Thai surrogate mother - but taking his twin sister - after learning the boy had Down's Syndrome.

Though the couple disputes the allegation, the case prompted a crackdown by Thai authorities on what had been a largely unregulated industry.

After the Australian case emerged, police received a tip that prompted the raid on Mr Shigeta's Bangkok flat.

Mr Ratpratan appeared during the raid to insist that Mr Shigeta had done nothing wrong.

'These are legal babies, they all have birth certificates,' he told Thailand's Channel 3 television station.

'There are assets purchased under these babies' names. There are savings accounts for these babies, and investments. If he were to sell these babies, why would he give them these benefits?'

He is no longer Mr Shigeta's lawyer, and his replacement has not responded to requests for comment. Mr Shigeta's current whereabouts are unknown.
