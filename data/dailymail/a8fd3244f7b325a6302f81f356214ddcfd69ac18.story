One Florida waiter had a very memorable night at work on Tuesday thanks to a generous couple.

Carlos Perez of Naples, Florida, was having a particularly busy night at Pazzo! restaurant, and one of his tables told him to take his time bringing them a very expensive bottle of Tuscan wine.

Then, when Perez returned to take their orders, the gentleman asked him to see if the chef would make veal marsala for an extra $20, a dish that is not on the menu.

The chef obliged, and did not take the money, so the man told Perez to put two cases of beer on his bill for the entire staff to enjoy after work.

'We’re talking about 48 beers. That’s $240 in beers just for the staff,' Perez told Naples Daily News.

Then, the gentleman, whose identity the restaurant will not reveal, asked Perez, ‘What would you do if you had some money?’

Perez said he would fix his car, and with that the man said, 'Don’t worry about it, Carlos. You’re going to fix your car tomorrow. I’m going to get you a $1,500 tip.'

He was good to his word too, and though Perez tried to refuse him, he handed over $1,500 at the end of the meal. 

'The woman looked at me. She grabbed my hand and said, "You deserve this; don’t think twice about it,"' said Perez.

Good guy: Perez's manager said it could not happen to a better or nicer guy

And it turns out it could not have happened to a better guy.

'He has what we call the hospitality heart,' said James Corbett, the restaurant's manager. 

'He takes a lot of pride in his job. He’s definitely deserving of that kind of generosity.'
