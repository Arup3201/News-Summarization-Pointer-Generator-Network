She cuddled a kangaroo on her first day in Australia. So it was only a matter of time before the Duchess of Cornwall met the country’s other famous marsupial, the koala.

And as she snuggled up to fluffy nine-month-old orphan Matilda, Camilla was so smitten she joked about smuggling the animal home.

Prince Charles’s koala, Kao, four, was less docile and wriggled around as his royal handler attempted to get a grip. Given the breed’s reputation for weak bladders, Charles joked: ‘Something ominous will run down!’

The couple met the furry pair at 
Government House in Adelaide, the latest stop on their fortnight-long 
Diamond Jubilee tour to Papua New Guinea, Australia and New Zealand.

The koalas, both rescue animals, were wrapped up in pouches, prompting Camilla to comment: ‘They’ve got their nappies on.’

She gestured to her husband to take 
fully-grown Kao, saying: ‘You take the big one, darling’, and looked 
entranced as the two animals gently touched noses as they greeted each 
other.

Earlier the couple had sipped one of 
the rarest wines in the world on a visit to the Penfolds vineyard in 
Adelaide. They were treated to a glass of a 1962 Coonawarra Cabernet 
Kalimna Shiraz – which costs £2,600 a bottle.

At half a century old, only 425 cases
of the wine were ever made. The couple were said to have ‘absolutely 
loved it’.

After touching down in South 
Australia and visiting a local school, the royal couple enjoyed local 
meats, cheese and olives and even a Tim Tam chocolate biscuit during a 
showcase of local produce.

The
prince showed his knowledge of local custom, saying the chocolate 
treats are best 'dunked', while Camilla acknowledged 'they can be quite 
addictive'.

Host for the showcase at Penfolds was
local food celebrity Maggie Beer, who said the royal couple were 
interested in all the local produce, from mutton to kangaroo to local 
cheese.

'They were so 
interested. They wanted to know about the farming. They wanted to know 
about the stories. We just didn't have enough time,' she said.

'He reacted with the issues about farming and sustainability with real knowledge.'

Earlier, the royal couple toured the Kilkenny Primary School in the city's western suburbs where food was also a key topic.

They were shown over a kitchen garden which was developed as part of a program established by celebrated chef Stephanie Alexander.

After Penfolds they headed for the Adelaide Convention Centre and a more public welcome alongside the Torrens River.

The prince was then to be shown plans
for the extensive Riverside precinct redevelopment before meeting up 
with the duchess at Government House for an official reception.

A
Government House reception wound up the whistle-stop five-hour South 
Australia leg of the tour, where the royal couple cuddled some koalas 
before returning to Melbourne.

Earlier
in the tour, the Duchess of Cornwall opened her heart about how 
osteoporosis devastated her family as she highlighted the fight against 
the debilitating condition in Australia.

Camilla described how she watched her mother and grandmother die from the crippling bone disease as she addressed a leading charity in Melbourne.

The Duchess asked for a reception to 
be held with Osteoporosis Australia so should could get the message of 
prevention across to the public.

Her mother lost about eight inches in 
height and became so bent she was unable to digest her food properly 
before she died at 72 in 1994.

'I watched my mother and grandmother die of this disease and no-one knew what this disease was.'

The Duchess of Cornwall

Camilla
told her audience at Government House, Melbourne: 'I watched my mother 
and grandmother die of this disease and no-one knew what this disease 
was.

'But since then the 
research has gone from strength to strength and they've made huge 
strides in the UK as you are here (in Australia). To unite with all of 
you today is so important, to get the message worldwide to people that 
it can be prevented.'

Almost three million people in the UK are estimated to have osteoporosis while in Australia the figure is 1.2 million.

The
Duchess' first public speech was about the disease and made in 2002 at 
the World Congress on Osteoporosis in Lisbon, Portugal.

The
Duchess, who is president of the National Osteoporosis Society in the 
UK, stressed all people had to be aware of the disease.

'It's
not just the women, it's the men as well, sometimes I think they've 
gotten away with it but they are affected, and young people,' she said.

'Also
the message I'd love to get over is to make young people aware of how 
important it is in their teenage years to take exercise, to eat 
properly, to not diet too strongly because it will catch up with you as 
you get older.'
