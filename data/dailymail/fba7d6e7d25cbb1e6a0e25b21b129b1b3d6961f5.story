When the Duchess of Cambridge wore emerald green on a visit to the Natural History Museum last month, little did she know that she was setting the tone for the coming year.

Globally renowned colour charters Pantone have announced the same hue as the official Colour Of The Year 2013, replacing tangerine, their colour for 2012.

Pantone commented that '17-1463 Tangerine Tango, a spirited,
reddish orange, provided the energy boost we needed to recharge and 
move forward', while Pantone 17-5641 Emerald is 'a lively, radiant, lush, vivid, verdant green' which 'enhances our sense of 
well-being further by inspiring insight, as well as promoting balance 
and harmony'.

Every December Pantone announces their forecast for the following year, and other colours that have won top prize include Honeysuckle, turqoise, mimosa and blue iris.

The brand said: 'Most often associated with brilliant, precious gemstones, the perception
of Emerald is sophisticated and luxurious.

'Since antiquity, this 
luminous, magnificent hue has been the color of beauty and new life in 
many cultures and religions. Itâ€™s also the color of growth, renewal and 
prosperity - no other color conveys regeneration more than green. For 
centuries, many countries have chosen green to represent healing and 
unity.'

Emerald Green has been chosen as Pantone's Colour Of The Year

Leatrice Eiseman, 
executive director of the Pantone Color Institute, said: 'Green is the most abundant hue in nature - the human eye sees more 
green than any other color in the spectrum.

'As it has 
throughout history, multifaceted Emerald continues to sparkle and 
fascinate. Symbolically, Emerald brings a sense of clarity, renewal and 
rejuvenation, which is so important in today's complex world. This 
powerful and universally appealing tone translates easily to both 
fashion and home interiors.'

Emerald featured in Pantone's last Colour Report, and was also incorporated into the Spring/Summer 2013 collections of many designers, including Tracy Reese, Nanette 
Lepore, Barbara Tfank, NAHM and Marimekko.

Zac Posen used plenty of emerald green in his Spring/Summer 2013 runway shows at New York Fashion Week

To arrive 
at their selection for Colour Of The Year, Pantone 'combs the world looking for 
color influences'. This can include the films 
that are in production, traveling art collections, hot new artists, 
popular travel destinations, technology, new textures and sports events.
