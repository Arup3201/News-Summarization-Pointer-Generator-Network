Former Arsenal captain Thierry Henry hopes that his old club do not suffer a league title drought as long as Liverpool's and is backing them to make sure of that in the near future.  

Liverpool have not been crowned league champions since 1990 and save for last season's surprise charge, have sparsely been involved in the title mix for the past few years.

Henry told L'Equipe, 'If I had told you in 1990 that Liverpool would not win the title in the next 25 years, you would have taken me for a madman. I don't want the same thing to happen to Arsenal.'

Henry is Arsenal's all-time leading goalscorer with 228 goals in 376 appearances for the club

Arsenal are currently third in the Premier League table with 60 points, seven behind leaders Chelsea who have played one game less. 

While that gap might prove insurmountable at this late stage of the season, Henry is confident that the current crop of Gunners players could be developed to push for the title soon. 

He said, 'This year, we're not so far off. With the exception of the first leg against Monaco, they are on the right track, but they undoubtedly dropped too many points at the start of the season. But I think this squad can win the title in the years to come.'

Following a 2-1 win over Newcastle at St James' Park, Arsenal are currently third in the league table

Henry was part of the last Arsenal side to win the Premier League title back in the 2003-04 season 

Henry was part of the last Arsenal team to win the Premier League in the 2003-2004 season, when Arsene Wenger's 'Invincibles' managed to go the entire campaign undefeated.  

Having made little secret of his ambition to move into management following the end of his playing career in December last year, Henry has been one of the names touted to replace Wenger in the Arsenal dug-out, and is presently helping to coach the club's academy players.  

However, the Frenchman insists that he is happy in his current role for now and just wants to learn the trade before targeting the top job.  

'I don't have the pretension to be able to coach a team nor succeed Arsene Wenger. I just want to learn with the Arsenal youngsters. I just want to be ready if -- one day -- an opportunity presents itself.'
