Travellers who flout hand luggage liquid rules are creating longer queues at one of the UK’s busiest airports at the height of the summer travel season.

More than 4,000 passengers are breaching the restrictions every day as they pass through Manchester Airport – causing unnecessary delays as people try to get through security and board their flights.

The figure amounts to 10 per cent of the 40,000 pieces of hand luggage that are inspected by airport security officials on a daily basis.

Liquids can be carried in hand luggage if they are under 100ml and placed in a clear, resealable plastic bag

Manchester Airport shared the figures after it received public criticism over growing queues during what is expected to be its busiest summer since 2007.

Airport officials say many passengers are unaware of the rules, even though the restrictions have existed at airports around the world for years.

Current rules require all liquids in containers over 100ml in size, including large bottles of water, lotions and perfume, to be stored in luggage in an aircraft’s hold.

If large containers are found in a traveller’s hand luggage they will likely be thrown in the bin.

All in a day's work: Security officials at Manchester Airport inspect 40,000 pieces of hand luggage a day

In Manchester, travellers have been quick to lay blame or express their discontent over security and passport control queues this summer.

Forty-year-old passenger Darren Harris, of Stalybridge, told the Manchester Evening News he waited in line for more than an hour after flying in from Malaga last Friday: ‘It went down the corridor and down to where the planes land. I was quite shocked. I have never seen it that bad before.’

Border Force said 13 flights arrived outside their scheduled times and they deployed additional staff, but they would not compromise security while the necessary checks took place.

To reduce delays, the airport has invested £20million in security this year.

Tricia Williams, the airport’s customer services director, said: ‘This summer we have increased security staff and during peak times all available staff and lanes are open for passengers to use and if needs be we deploy security staff to other terminals to help alleviate pinch points.’

She said queues are already longer during the summer due to the increase in passengers and the fact travellers are leaving additional time for their journey. 

The airport is encouraging passengers to allow plenty of time before their departure and obey the hand luggage restrictions.

Spokeswoman Heather Griffiths said Gatwick Airport is not experiencing similar issues.

She said it takes passengers an average of two minutes to pass through security at Gatwick.
