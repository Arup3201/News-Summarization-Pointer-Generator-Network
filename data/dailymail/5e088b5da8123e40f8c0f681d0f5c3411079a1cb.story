Footballers across England will don rainbow-coloured laces this weekend - as part of an anti-homophobia in football campaign launched on Monday.

Rainbow laces - which has already been backed by Arsenal players in a television advert - is now in its second year, and after being backed by The FA, should see an increase from last year where players from 52 league clubs swapped their boot strings.

Joey Barton and Hull City have already thrown their backing behind the movement which is designed to send out a message that anti-gay abuse will not be tolerated in football.

'Like that of the Rainbow Laces campaign, The FA’s message is simple: homophobia, like all forms of discrimination, is unacceptable,' an FA statement said.

The campaign also has the support of Stonewall, the biggest charity in Europe for lesbian, gay and bisexual equality - and they will be hoping to put some criticism of the movement from last year to bed.

Rainbow laces was criticised for relying on 'sexualised innuendo and stereotypes about gay men' - while it was felt that homophobic language was being blurred with football banter by bookmakers backing the scheme.

QPR midfielder Barton, who wore the multi-coloured laces last season, told The Metro: 'There are always people who are going to complain – they will say blue is red for the sake of an argument.

'The key is getting the message out to the public that us lads are supportive of fellow pros and supporters, no matter what their sexual orientation.'
