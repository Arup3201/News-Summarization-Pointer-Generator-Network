Despite many Americans continuing to struggle due to tight economic circumstances, the number of millionaires in the U.S. has never been higher with more than 9.6 million living the good life.

Although the recession in 2008 caused the number of millionaires to drop drastically to only 6.7 million, a bullish stock market in recent years has led to a rebound in the ranks of the rich, according to the Spectrem Group, a research and consulting firm in the wealth and retirement industry.

The previous record for most American millionaires was in 2008 when it reached 9.2 million, before the recession hit. Between 2012 and 2013 alone, the number of millionaires rose by 600,000. And in 2003, the figure stood at 6.2 million.

'Most of the financial damage done by the recession has been erased by recent record-high markets in 2013 as well as continued rebound in the real estate markets,” Spectrem President George H. Walper Jr. said. 'In terms of the affluent investor, it is fair to say they have finally recovered from the economic downturn.'

According to Spectrem's Affluent Market Insight's Report for 2014, the number of the super rich — those with a net worth of $25 million or more — also reached new height as that number stands at 132,000. The previous record was 125,000 in 2008, also just before the recession hit.

Even those who aren't millionaires but still managed to have a net worth of at least $500,000 rose to 15.3 million. However, that's still shy of the high of 15.7 million achieved in 2007. And households with a net worth of at least $100,000 reached a new high of $100,000 of 38.6 million.

The report also found that 52% of millionaires plan to invest in stocks and mutual funds. Also, 81% seek the advice of a professional advisor and 35% use a full-service broker.

Millionaires are also becoming more adept at using social media. 55% of them are on Facebook, compared with only 26% in 2010. Also, 34% have LinkedIn accounts, compared with 17% in 2010, and 23% actively use YouTube.
