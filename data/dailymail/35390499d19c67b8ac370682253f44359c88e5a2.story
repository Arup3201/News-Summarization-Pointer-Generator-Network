Disney has made a virtue of home movies of excited young children reacting with glee when their parents tell them they are off to the Most Magical Place on Earth.

But there are few videos of children reacting like Mary Carlisle Williams.

In a video that has gone viral, the three-year-old is seated expectantly at Pensacola International Airport in Florida when her mother Mandy announces they are going to Disney World.

Expectant: Mary Carlisle Williams' parents told her the family was going to DisneyWorld. What happened next is surprising...

... The girl's face falls and she  sadly mumbles: 'I want to go to Mobile'

Instead of squealing with joy, the 
little girl's face drops and she says: 'I want to go to Mobile', 
referring to the city in south west Alabama, 500 miles away from the 
world-famous resort - and the home of her grandmother Donna Williams.

She then hops down from her seat, walks over to a table, places her face in her arms and begins to cry.

'She loves going to her grandmother's house, and when we were going to Pensacola to get on the airplane, she knew that her grandmother and grandfather would be there,' said her father, Andrew Williams.

Mary walks away from her mother, places her head in her arms and begins to cry, but it all worked out in the end

'Whenever she saw them she immediately thought she was going to get to go to their house. Turns out that Mimi's house trumps Disney World,' he told Al.com.

After the video went viral, city officials in Mobile decided to make Mary an official ambassador.

Last week the mayor Sandy Stimpson presented her with a key to the city, a teddy bear and a year-long pass to the city's mobile museum of art.

Mayor Stimpson said: 'Mary Carlisle Williams probably did, in 20 seconds, more to bring exposure and focus to the City of Mobile than most people have done in a lifetime.'

As well as being a viral hit, the video has hit the national news headlines and has even featured as a joke on The Tonight Show.

The surprise trip was planned by her parents, who wanted to surprise Mary after she had begged for months to go to the theme park.

'We played it up in our minds that it was going to be this great surprise for her,' Mrs Williams said. 'It was not the reaction we expected. Mary Carlisle just wanted to go to Mobile.'

However, little Mary soon overcame her disappointment and her parents report she had a wonderful time at DisneyWorld.
