The asylum seeker policy debate is settled, the coalition has stopped the boats and it's time to move on, Immigration Minister Scott Morrison will declare.

In a major speech to the National Press Club on Wednesday to mark one year since the beginning of Operation Sovereign Borders, Mr Morrison will say the 'grand policy experiment' of the last decade is over.

'It's the coalition policies that effectively stopped the boats,' he is expected to say. 'That argument, that debate is settled and it's time to move on.'

Mr Morrison told ABC radio that Labor's policies had 'completely failed' but the coalition was fixing the problem.

'We're well on the road to doing that,' he said. 'I think we can now move on in this debate.'

The speech comes after recent revelations about 'filthy' living conditions at Australia's immigration centre compounds on Manus Island in Papua New Guinea.

Former detention centre guard Beau Mitchell took photographs of the 'filthy' living conditions before he quit his job in disgust.

Mr Mitchell told the ABC that he wasn't surprised Iranian asylum seeker Hamid Kehazaei died from an infection he caught at the detention centre. 

Mr Kehazaei, 24, is believed to have spent days seeking treatment for a cut on his foot that had been there for weeks whilst he was detained at Manus Island.

He was initially transferred to a Port Moresby hospital to treat his septicaemia, where he had a heart attack before being sent to Brisbane.

He was then declared brain dead at Mater Private Hospital before his family made the heartbreaking decision to turn off his life support last Friday.

Mr Morrison has rejected suggestions the care provided to Mr Kehazaei was inadequate.

Opposition immigration spokesman Richard Marles has said Labor continues to be concerned about the lack of transparency surrounding the treatment of asylum seekers.
