A lifelong San Francisco Giants fan had a piece of team history in his hands after Thursday's game: the walk-off home-run ball that sent the Giants to the World Series.

Then he gave it back.

Frank Burke, who owns a transmission repair business in Oakdale told the San Jose Mercury News  that he wanted the hitter, Travis Ishikawa, to have the ball.

The winning hit: Travis Ishikawa triumphantly made the winning home run that propelled the San Francisco Giants into The World Series games

'I'm just the lucky guy who caught it. Travis deserves all the credit for hitting the ball. It belongs on his trophy case, not mine,' said Burke.

So after having it authenticated by a Giants official and learning Ishikawa wanted it back, Burke went down to the clubhouse area and handed it over. Ishikawa gave him a signed bat in return. 

Burke said he had asked for World Series tickets, but was told that might not be possible.

'So I said, `All right. I was going to give the ball back either way,' he said.

I tried to have soft hands. It bounced out on the roof. I snatched it up as soon as it hit. I was afraid it would go back on the field,'Burke told News 10 of catching the ball.

After doing a media interview the next morning, he got a call from the Giants. 

Kindness rewarded: Burke was rewarded a signed baseball bat and ticket to game three of the World Series against the Kansas City Royals

The catch: Frank Burke caught the home-run ball that put the Giants into the World Series games

Burke now has four tickets to Game 3 of the World Series at San Francisco's AT&T Park on Friday. It will be the Giants first home game against the Kansas City Royals.

Burke was at Thursday's game with his friend, Greg Leutza, who is battling cancer. He wanted to do something special for Leutza and went searching for tickets after the Giants clinched the National League Division Series, he told another newspaper, the Modesto Bee.

Ishikawa's drive came their way as they sat above the stadium's right field wall in the bottom of the ninth inning with two Giants on base.

'My main thought was to keep it in front of me and don't let it fall to the field,' Burke told the Bee.

The ball went off his left hand, but he was able to corral it. Burke posed triumphantly with the ball for photos and said he gave other fans a chance to touch it as well.

After making the amazing catch he called his wife to tell her what he'd done. maybe she'll be joing his at the next game.

'I dropped my phone at Wendy's and said my husband caught the home run ball. Everyone there thought I was insane,' Michelle Burke recounted with joy.

Big win: 'I'm just the lucky guy who caught it. Travis deserves all the credit for hitting the ball. It belongs on his trophy case, not mine,' said Burke of the Giants player.
