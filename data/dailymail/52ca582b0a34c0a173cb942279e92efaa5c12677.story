The family of a teenage girl who died after she was refused access to potentially life-saving cancer drugs has called for a change in the laws governing who can take part in medical trials.

Chloe Drury was told she was too young to take part in the drugs trials by American pharmaceutical company BioMarin while she was suffering from a rare form of bone cancer, despite pleas from her parents, doctors and politicians.

She died in February, a month after her 18th birthday, from Ewing's Sarcoma after the cancer had aggressively progressed.

The previous September, when she was 17, she was told she could not take part in the trials as it could 'jeopardise [her] safety and the integrity of the trial data', her family have told Sky News.

Chloe, from Purley, in Surrey, was allowed on the course when she turned 18, but by then it was too late.

Her mother Debbie Binner told Sky News: 'We were just sitting there watching our beautiful 17-year-old daughter get weaker and weaker, knowing there is something out there she could have had and it just seems totally wrong to me, and not a world that I want to live in that treats young people like that.'

The family now wants age restrictions to be lifted for trials.

In a statement, BioMarin has said their deepest sympathy went to the parents.

The company said: 'It is precisely because of patients who suffer from devastating rare genetic diseases that BioMarin develops therapies where there are few, if any, options.'

The company said it was conducting a trial in several genetically defined cancers, but it added: 'It is premature to know if it is safe or effective.'

Cancer Research UK's clinical research director Kate Law said the guidelines did not always make sense and sometimes stopped teenagers taking part.

She said for many trials there was 'no good reason' for the restrictions.
