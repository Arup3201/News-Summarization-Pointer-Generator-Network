Come rain or shine, Harry Beardsell is never without his favourite pair of sunglasses.

The six-year-old must wear shades all year round to protect him from the effects of an incurable disease.

Harry, from Canvey Island, Essex, suffers from a rare condition called cystinosis.This causes crystals to form in his eyes, making the glare of normal daylight unbearable - even on a relatively dull day.

Even the family home has tinted windows to make Harry's life more bearable.

His mother Nicola Watts, 33, said: 'Harry has to be careful all year round to keep his eyes protected, but he has to take extra care in the summer.

'He will wear a hat and glasses whenever he leaves the house, or the glare of the light would be unbearable.

'Before he wore them, being in the sun was absolute agony for him - walking on the beach near our house was out of the question.'

'Harry once told me that he couldn’t wait until he was older and didn’t have to wear the sunglasses anymore, but I gently explained that it wasn’t going to work like that.

'He never complains, he just accepts it - he’s a lovely little boy.'

Harry was diagnosed with cystinosis the day after his first birthday. His mother said: 'I was devastated. They described it as a long term, terminal illness.

'You just think that your precious, gorgeous little boy is going to die.

'No matter how much they explain it to you, that’s all that you hear - I couldn’t take any of it in.'

Ms Watts first noticed something was wrong with Harry when he was nine months old.

She said: 'He kept getting the flu and had a rattly chest. He was always thirsty and was sick quite a lot, but every time I took him to the doctors I was told he was fine.

'Doctors said I was just an over cautious first time mum and had nothing to worry about.'

But on Christmas day 2008, Harry took a turn for the worse, being violently sick.

'I rushed him to A&E where he was eventually diagnosed with rickets. It was a relief at the time because I thought I’d finally found out what was wrong with him and he could be cured.

'But all of his levels continued to remain low, so we were transferred to another hospital - it was when I walked into that hospital that I knew something was really wrong with Harry, because all the other patients were in such a bad way.'

Today Harry is a happy six year old boy, but must take 13 different types of medication every day.

He also uses eye drops which to try and break down the crystals.

His mother said: 'He’s really upbeat and cheeky, and has lots of friends who are very protective of him.

'I’m so proud of him - he makes me smile every day.'

Harry is now eating solid food, but had previously needed a tube directly into his stomach.

Jonathan Terry, 51, the founder of Cystinosis Foundation UK and the oldest person with the condition outside of the U.S., said: 'Cystinosis is a condition where the sufferer cannot break down the cysteine amino aside.

'A normal person can excrete this acid, but for people with the condition, the acid attacks every organ in the body, particularly the kidneys, liver and pancreas.

'Most patients will have to have a transplant by the time they are seven or eight or they will most likely die.

'Many, like Harry, will have to wear glasses because the crystals of the acid build up in the cornea and magnify the light in all directions like a diamond would.

'It makes glare of normal daylight unbearable - even on a relatively dull day it would seem bright.

'Just one in every 200,000 people are born with the condition, and there are currently just 150 known cases in the UK.'
