Cristiano Ronaldo has once again trained for Portugal ahead of their Group G clash with USA on Sunday - despite being warned that he risks his career by playing on at the World Cup.

The 29-year-old Real Madrid forward has been struggling with a knee injury and doctors have told him that he could shorten his career by playing for Portugal in the short-term.

However, Ronaldo seems determined to star for his country in Brazil and showed few signs of his injury during training on Friday.

He did wear a small protective bandage over his knee, but it was nothing like the heavy strapping he wore when he limped out of training earlier in the week.

And Portugal boss Paulo Bento will be particularly keen to have his talisman on the field against USA following his side's 4-0 humbling at the hands of Germany.

A Thomas Muller hat-trick and a Mats Hummels header plunged Portugal to the bottom of Group G and Bento knows that a win against the Americans is crucial for his side's chances of progressing to the last-16.

Ronaldo may even have painkilling injections to ensure he can play with an injury that should have ruled him out of the tournament.

The 2014 Ballon D'Or winner is a pivotal member of the Portuguese side, having scored eight goals in qualification to ensure they qualified for Brazil.

He has won 112 caps, scoring 49 goals for Portugal.
