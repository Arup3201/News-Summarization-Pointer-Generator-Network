France today reached the gates of fabled Malian city Timbuktu after yesterday defeating jihadist fighters to take control Gao.

The troops have been advancing through Kidal, Timbuktu, Lere and Diabaly - which had been seized by militants by are steadily being recovered.

The French military wrested control of the airport at Mali's largest northern city, under cover of darkness, in a major breakthrough in its offensive to rout the Islamists from power.

Today they were ready to flush out any rebels still hiding in the UNESCO World Heritage town of Timbuktu.

Nearly 30 bombs have reportedly been dropped from fighter jets over the past two days during the struggle to beat the extremists, who have links to al-Qaeda.

Special forces stormed in by land 
and by air two weeks ago, coming under fire from 'several terrorist elements' that 
were later 'destroyed', the French miltary said in a statement 
on its website.

In a later press release entitled 'French and Malian troops liberate Gao', the French ministry of defence said they were bringing back the town's mayor, Sadou Diallo, who had fled to the Malian capital Bamako.

But a defence ministry official clarified that the city had not been fully liberated, and the process of freeing Gao was continuing.

Gao, in north-eastern Mali, was seized by the jihadist fighters nine months ago, and the battle to retake it was expected to be tough.

The rebel fighters are believed to include Algerians, Egyptians, Mauritanians, Libyans, Tunisians, Pakistanis and even Afghans.

French and Malian forces faced sporadic 'acts of harassment' during the day, said Colonel Thierry Burkhard, a French military spokesman in Paris. He had no immediate estimate on casualties.

The operation in Gao comes at the same time as airstrikes in the two other provincial capitals held by the extremists - the cities of Timbuktu and Kidal, which like Gao fell to the rebels last April, during the chaotic aftermath of a coup in the distant capital.

The simultaneous aerial attacks also come as ground troops are carrying out a pincer movement, with French and African land forces heading to Gao from Niger, where Chad has sent a battalion.

The Pentagon has said that the US will aid the French military with aerial refuelling missions.

US aerial refuelling planes would be a boost to air support for French ground forces as they enter areas of Mali that are controlled by the extremists.

The US was already helping France by transporting French troops and equipment to the West African nation.

French and Malian forces are also heading to Timbuktu, via the central corridor that leads north from the central Malian city of Segou, through the recently recaptured town of Diabaly.

Since France began its military operation, the Islamists have retreated from three small towns in central Mali - Diabaly, Konna and Douentza.
