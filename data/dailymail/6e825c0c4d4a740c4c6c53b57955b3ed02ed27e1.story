Yoko Ono is a regular on Twitter, using it as a platform to share such gems as 'Remember, we are all water in the same ocean'.

And while her 4.7million followers may smile wryly at her more mystical offerings, one, in particular, is driven mad by them.

Tennis coach Judy Murray has taken to mocking John Lennon's widow on Twitter, retweeting her thoughts and adding jokes of her own.

Barely a day goes past on the social network without the mother of Wimbledon champion Andy Murray making a jokey comeback to the 81-year-old New Yorker.

Musings: Yoko Ono's mystical messages on Twitter are relentlessly mocked by tennis coach, Judy Murray

Not impressed: Judy Murray, 54, replies in typical fashion to one of the New Yorker's messages on Twitter

'Give us peace springs to mind': Murray seems unmoved by the pacifist's thoughtful messages of peace

Not smiliing: Murray, who is from Dunblane, has no truck for another of Ono's more spiritual pronouncements

Earlier this week, Ono posted on Twitter: 'Clean up the water inside your body.  Let's be the oasis for the world.

'Even if you don't announce it, it will be felt by the whole world'.

Murray, 54, was clearly at the end of her tether when she replied: 'Face. Palm'.

Hours before, Ono had tweeted: 'Think PEACE, Act PEACE, Spread PEACE and tell your friends to IMAGINE PEACE'.

To which Murray, from Dunblane, replied: 'Mmm.  Give us PEACE springs to mind'.

When Ono tweeted: 'Send a friend a photo that says "Smile" or a picture, a story or a piece of pie, but specify it's a smile ur passing on', Murray tweeted back: 'Yes dear'.

Taunting: The mother of Wimbledon tennis champion, Andy Murray, finds Ono's tricks don't work for her

'What is beauty?' Murray's tweets demonstrate not only a sharp sense of humour but also a surprising love of cakes

'Course we will': The Scotswoman and mother of two has little patience for Ono's most unlikely suggestions

And when Ono wrote: 'Attach a card saying SPACE TRANSFORMER to the room and/or object you wish to transform', Murray replied: 'Did it....nothing happened.  What now?'

Ono, mother of Kyoko Chan Cox by her first husband, Anthony Cox, and of Sean Lennon by the Beatle, has not yet replied to the taunts by the Scotswoman.

Indeed, she seems to derive great comfort from Twitter, tweeting recently: 'A big hug + kiss to each one of you.  I feel privileged to share this time with you.

'Thank you for being in my life.'

Murray, who has 94,500 followers on Twitter, replied: 'Ur welcome.'

Her tweets demonstrate a humour many of had not suspected the mother of the steely-jawed tennis star possessed.

Running out of patience: The New Yorker comes up with ideas of how her followers can explore spirituality

Not on the same wavelength: Ono's more philosophical musings are not enjoyed by the dour Judy Murray

Thoughts for the day: Ono tweeted these two suggestions for her 4.68million followers earlier this month

When Ono wrote: 'This is a piece of sky.  Hold on to it. After 10 years we will get together and put the sky back into one piece', Murray immediately retorted: 'Course we will.'

But she isn't always so charitable.

In response to Ono's suggestion: 'Get a telephone that only echoes back your voice.  Call every day and talk about many things', Murray wrote: 'First sign of madness'.

And when Ono wrote: 'I think it's impossible to see a chair as it it', an impatient Murray replied: 'Four legs, a seat and a back rest.  What's not to see?'

Good idea: Ono, who is 81, also tweets photographs of herself overlooking the sea or lakes

Let it be: The widow of John Lennon is an enthusiastic tweeter, often sharing messages of peace online

Ono has two children; Kyoko Chan Cox from her first marriage, and Sean Lennon by Beatle John Lennon

A very few Ono musings go unremarked, such as: 'Make a sculpture to put on a mountain for people to see with telescopes.'

Another tweet the tennis coach may have missed was: 'Next time you meet a foreigner, remember it's only like a window with a different shape to it and the person who's sitting inside is you.'

While Ono has yet to reply to Murray, her enthusiasm for Twitter continues unabated.  Already this week she has reminded her followers that it was Mother's Day in Slovenia, and encouraged them to 'be playful - dance with your mind and body'.

It is likely that at least one of her followers won't be taking her up on it.
