The mother of one of the girls involved in a drinking game that left a nine-year-old in hospital has blamed Facebook for the shocking incident.

She said the three girls, aged eight, nine and 11, stole drinks from her cabinet after watching videos of so-called Neknominate stunts  on Facebook.

They then went to a shed where Rhiannon Scully downed a dangerous mix of vodka, whisky and orange juice.

The woman, who is the mother of the 11-year-old girl and gave her name only as Mrs Leader, called for Facebook to ban videos of Neknominations. Three people have died taking part in the drinking craze.

‘The NekNomination videos should be banned to protect the children,' she said.

‘It is not appropriate for Facebook to have these videos on the site when children can access them, especially if people have died as a result. I think it is ridiculous.

‘In reality children as young as eight are on Facebook and they can see these videos which inspire them. Facebook should stop allowing them from being shared. As a parent it does worry us that they can see these things so easily.

‘While I try and monitor my daughter’s Facebook I can only delete things my daughter writes, not what she sees.’ 

She said she allowed her daughter on Facebook, where users should be at least 13, to keep in touch with friends after moving to County Durham from Portsmouth.

Mrs Leader said she was at work when police called to say a girl had been taken to hospital after drinking.

Rhiannon had to have her stomach pumped as a result.

Her mother, Michelle, 32, found her daughter riding home ‘all over the place’ with ‘eyes rolling into the back of her head’ on her electric scooter and still in her school uniform.

Mrs Scully, who then phoned an ambulance, claimed her daughter had been dared to down the drink after the girls had been watching NekNomination videos on Facebook.

She said the act was filmed on a mobile phone and deleted soon after – but the families of the other two girls involved claimed they had no knowledge of this.

Police confirmed they questioned both Rhiannon’s family and her friends’ families about the incident but decided no action was required.

Mrs Leader, who has three children, two aged 17 and 14, said: ‘I had a phone call at work from the police saying my daughter and two friends were drinking and as a result one was sent to hospital.

‘They said it could be due to a NekNomination and asked if I knew what one was.

‘No one was in at the time, I was at work, and I was told the three girls had come into the house and taken a bottle of vodka from a globe in the house that opens.

‘They had been playing at one of the girls’ houses down the road and then came to house. They took three plastic tumblers into the garden shed and that is apparently when Rhiannon drank the mixture.

‘The other two didn’t want to drink it, my daughter has never drank in her life.’ She said she had been left totally ‘shocked’ by the incident as herself and her husband, a coach driver, rarely drank.

She said: ‘I’m not a drinker myself, and as for my daughter, she’s a normal 11-year-old girl, she hasn’t touched the stuff. She’s a good girl who comes home from school and does her homework or plays round at her friends’ houses. She is a normal 11-year-old girl.

‘We told her how terrible it was what happened and she knows it is wrong to drink and we were really worried.

‘She has Facebook and I go through it to check it as I’m aware how young she is. We moved from Portsmouth and she wanted to be in contact with her friends on Facebook while we were here.

‘In theory she shouldn’t be on it but all her friends are and if she wasn’t she would be looking at her sister's.’

Her grandmother, Diane Leader, 60, called for Facebook to stop fuelling the NekNominate craze – a drinking game in which people post videos of themselves on the site drinking dangerous and bizarre concoctions of alcohol then dare their friends to outdo them.

She said: ‘It is absolutely shocking. I don’t agree with the craze or Facebook allowing them to be posted at all. It should be banned, it worries me that children younger than nine can be on there looking at these things.

‘They start playing games that mum and dad might play on the internet and then they just have to glance at something on Facebook and they get these ideas.’

Chief Supt Ivan Wood, in charge of neighbourhood policing across the entire Durham Police force area, said: ‘This case brings into sharp focus the rise of the influence of the Internet and the emergence of NekNominate in particular.

‘There is no control over the social media and the young people who get access to it even when they should not.

‘They see older teenagers doing it, and now even young children are doing it, they just copy their behaviour. There is so much risk around it, and I think this is what happened here.’

A Facebook spokesman said: 'Facebook's rules are clear, you have to be 13 to use our service.

'We ask that people follow our rules and provide simple reporting links all over Facebook so that people can report things to us, including under 13s. Once underage profiles are reported to us, they are quickly removed.'
