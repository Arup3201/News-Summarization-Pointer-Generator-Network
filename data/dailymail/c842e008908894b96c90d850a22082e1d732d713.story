A hospital accused of making 'serious errors' in the care of a child has become the subject of an independent inquiry.

Luke Jenkins, from Cardiff, was admitted to Bristol Children’s Hospital for routine heart surgery in April 2012.

But the seven-year-old, who was expected to make a full recovery, died from a cardiac arrest.

In
 November 2013, a coroner recorded a narrative conclusion, but his 
family maintain the hospital could have done more to save 
him.

Now
 an independent inquiry has been launched into the children’s cardiac 
unit, which has been accused of making 'serious errors' in Luke's 
treatment.

The Bristol Review into cardiac services at the hospital, which was opened yesterday, aims to gather evidence from aggrieved families who claim they have suffered at the hands of staff.

The hospital was accused of a catalogue of neglect and mistreatment of babies and children with heart problems.

Last year, it emerged that around 10 families were believed to be taking legal action against the trust, including seven whose children died following treatment at the hospital.

Luke’s mother Faye Valentine, who has campaigned for improvements in quality of care, believes her son’s death was preventable.

She said: 'Nothing will bring Luke back - we just want to seek justice.

'It feels like we have been pushing for 
this for a long time, but we are hopeful something good will come of it.
 We cannot be negative about it.

'All we want the hospital to do is accept they were wrong in the treatment of my son. My main concern is making the hospital a safe place.'

Launching the inquiry in Bristol, Eleanor Grey QC, who has been commissioned by NHS England to conduct the review, said confidentiality and support for witnesses would be an 'important principle' of its work.

She said: 'We won’t be having any public hearings. We want witnesses to feel as free and as well-supported as possible when they give their evidence.

'They will be free to bring a friend or a trade union representative, for example. We will also be offering independent, professional emotional support for participants, provided free under the NHS.'

Ms Grey said the review will examine care provided to children with congenital heart disease and the experiences of parents and carers from March 2010 until the present day.

It will look at all the respective cardiac services delivered, both in Bristol and through clinics closer to families’ homes.

Ms Grey 
said March 2010 was the date when new quality and safety standards were 
set but events before this date 'may well be relevant'.

The experiences of all potential witnesses will be valuable, she said, whether they are positive, negative or mixed.

Professor Sir Ian Kennedy QC, who specialises in the law and ethics of healthcare, will act as consultant advisor.

Sir
 Ian was chairman of a far-reaching inquiry into children’s heart 
surgery at the Bristol Royal Infirmary, which was published in 
2001.

The
 report made recommendations for a safer, more accountable health 
service. Ms Grey is a former counsel to the Bristol Royal Infirmary 
inquiry.

A
 spokesman for University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust said: 'We 
welcome this review and look forward to assisting as it gathers the 
views of patients and families over the coming months.

'It’s
 important that families who wish to share their views on the care 
provided by our children’s heart unit can do so easily and through a 
variety of accessible channels.

'We
 will make sure that Eleanor Grey QC and her team have full and 
unfettered access to the information they need and our expert clinical 
staff, managers and members of the trust board will be available to talk
 to the panel and answer their questions during the course of the 
review.'
