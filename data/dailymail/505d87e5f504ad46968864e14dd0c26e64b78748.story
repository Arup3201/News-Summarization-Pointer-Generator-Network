A veteran has finally received his Second World War medals - at the age of 95.

Former army cook Harry Weston mistakenly believed he had left it too late to request them after  finishing his military service in 1946. 

But nearly 70 years after the end of the conflict, a local historian applied on his behalf, and he was finally awarded them.

Mr Weston enlisted in the Army Catering Corps cook in 1940 and served in Scotland until 1946. 

During his time in the army, he and four other cooks prepared meals three times a day for a battalion of over 700 soldiers. 

He was based in Shetland and Orkney during the war and after completing his service returned home to Greetham, Rutland.

David Bland was researching Mr Weston's history when he discovered that he had never received his gongs and wrote to the Ministry of Defence last month. 

Just a few days later  shiny Defence Medal and War Medal arrived at the home Mr Weston shares with his wife Margaret.

David Bland and his son Paul are writing a village history book called Greetham and the Great War.

Paul Bland said: 'Harry was a bit surprised, but delighted to get his medals. He was really pleased.

'I imagine even 10 years after the war he might have thought it was too late.

'Harry had just got on with his life and had forgotten about it. We thought it was time to put it right.'

Greetham and the Great War will be released in e-book form later this year.
