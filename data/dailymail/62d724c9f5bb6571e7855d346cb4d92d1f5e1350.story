This Christmas is expected to be a boom year for fragrance sales, with perfumes by Lady Gaga and Marc Jacobs featuring in the top five most popular for him and her.

Scent sales are up six per cent on last year, and a total of £790m to be spent in the UK over
the festive season, according to industry experts.

Every adult in Britain is expected to spend £17.59 on perfume gifts this Christmas.

Lady Gaga's perfume is one of the best selling fragrances of the year so far

Lady Gaga's Fame was the star's first fragrance - but given the staggering success of this one, there will surely be more in the pipeline

Rakesh Aggarwal, CEO of leading UK beauty and fragrance website Escentual.com, who provided the figures, said: 'This Christmas market for 
perfume is already shaping up to be the best for since 2008.

'Early 
indications have been very positive and we are predicting a six per cent increase 
on last year, and have similar indications from other key players in the
market.'

Perfume and luxury goods sales in general are a major indicator for 
consumer confidence, especially over the Christmas period when the 
fragrances sold account for over half the total annual sales.

And 
fragrance sales are bucking the trend of much lower retail sales in 
other areas. Traditionally a massive 54 per cent of the total annual expenditure
on perfume is on Christmas presents for loved ones - the figures collected from October to 
December.

This year it is estimated that £789.9m will be spent on 
festive gifts, which will bring the total annual spend on perfume in 
2012 to £1.46 billion.

The James Bond 007 fragrance is proving popular among fans wising to smell like Daniel Crag as the world-famous spy - and is only likely to sell more towards the festive period

Mr Aggarwal said: 'Part of the reason of the boost
to the market has been that there have been some exciting new releases 
in the perfume market.

'The James Bond after-shave has been a huge seller
and has already made it into the top 10 men’s fragrances and is already
outselling big brands like Paco Rabanne, Prada, and Armani.

'Also the 
Lady Gaga perfume has sold well and has already broken into the top 10 
women’s fragrances this Christmas.'

Escentual.com Beauty Editor Emma Leslie compiled the top ten 
best selling fragrances for men and women in the UK, which are expected
