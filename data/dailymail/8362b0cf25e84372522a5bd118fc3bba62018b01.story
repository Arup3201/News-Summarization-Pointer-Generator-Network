A Pennsylvania father avoided being pepper sprayed by putting his son in front of him, it has been reported.

The Scranton Times-Tribune, citing a criminal complaint, reported that Taron Boddie brought another boy along when he went to pick his son up early from South Scranton Intermediate on Thursday.

Boddie was without identification and engaged in a verbal dispute with school workers, according to the newspaper.

The upset father, 35, was instructed by responding Patrolman Joseph Kearney that 'the child could be released to him if he got his identification,' the newspaper said.

After Boddie yelled and touched Kearney, the police officer made two tries to handcuff the father, The Scranton Times-Tribune reported.

'On the last attempt, Mr. Boddie pulled his young son in front of him as Patrolman Kearney took out his pepper spray with an order to Mr. Boddie to put his hands behind his back,' the newspaper said.

Boddie avoided pepper spray when he held his child up in front of Kearney, The Scranton Times-Tribune reported - but was sprayed after his son was grabbed by the school workers.
