An island owner has been forced to sell his lavish resort for less than half of the asking price, after being on the market for two years.

Vaughan Bullivant, founder of Nature's Own, bought Daydream Island in the Whitsundays, which is located off the central coast of Queensland, Australia, in 2000 for $25 million. 

Mr Bullivant hoped to sell the resort for $65 million but after being on the market for two years and his health deteriorating, the entrepreneur's agents urged Mr Bullivant to slash the island's price to $30 million.

Although it is not the price Mr Bullivant was hoping for, if sold, it will still be one of the highest sales for a resort island, according to The Daily Telegraph. 

Other islands that have recently been sold are Lindeman Island, also in the Whitsundays, which was bought for $12 million, Orpheus Island, a national park in North Queensland, for $6.25 million and Bedarra Island, in the Family Islands National Park, off the Queensland coast, which sold for just under $5 million. 

Another island owner who was expecting a high profit from his land is Peter Bond. He owns Dunk Island, in the Cassowary Coast Region, in Queensland, which was valued at $52 million but now is only worth $7.5 million after Cyclone Yasi in 2011.

Mr Bond is spending more than $20 million to fix  damages on his island.

But Wayne Bunz, CBRE Hotels' agent, is positive a 'passionate' buyer will show interest in Mr Bullivant's Daydream resort.

'You need passionate people to buy these island resorts,' said Mr Bunz.

'There’s romance, there’s prestige and ego with owning your own island, and the thing is you could buy Daydream for less than what some people’s private residence is worth in Sydney or Toorak (Melbourne).'

Peter Bond owner of Dunk Island in the Cassowary Coast Region in Queensland thought he would receive $52 million for his island. Now it is worth $7.5 million after Cyclone Yasi in 2011

Mr Bunz said the 4.5 star resort has video commercials in Mandarin to target Asian investors.

'The Chinese are absolutely in love with the Great Barrier Reef, so we’re hopeful we’ll get some renewed interest,' Mr Bunz said.

“The key thing is for the Chinese, that if you look around at any major economy, Australia is seen as a pretty safe haven to invest.' 

The Daydream resort is made up of 296 rooms and makes a profit of $27 million each year. 

Mr Bunz said a potential buyer could make changes to the resort, transforming it to a more luxurious stay. 

'The thing is hotels and islands need a facelift every five to seven years if they want to protect marketshare.' 

Mr Bullivant hopes the island will be sold by Christmas, giving buyers a chance to register their interest until November 6.
