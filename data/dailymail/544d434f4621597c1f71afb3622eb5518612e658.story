The house where notorious Colombian drug kingpin Pablo Escobar was killed is on the market – and it could be transformed into a tourist destination.

With an asking price of $250,000 (£160,000), the five-bedroom house in Medellin is already a draw for curious visitors who want to see where the wealthy and ruthless drug lord’s reign of terror came to an abrupt end 21 years ago.

But it could become a legitimate tourist site – such as a themed guesthouse or public museum – now that it is being advertised as an opportunity for rich foreign investors, according to Colombia Reports.

'King of Cocaine': Pablo Escobar is said to have had a net worth of nearly £20bn

After becoming one of the world’s wealthiest and most feared men, Escobar, who is said to have had a net worth of nearly £20bn, was gunned down on the roof of the two-storey house as he tried to elude the Search Bloc, a special police unit established to lead the manhunt, on 2 December 1993.

‘The King of Cocaine’ and other members of the Medellin Cartel were among the world’s most wanted drug traffickers in the late 1980s and early 1990s, with US special forces joining the manhunt a year before he was killed.

Today, tourists regularly pull up to the house to snap photos, but current homeowner Omar Restrepo has denied their requests to get a peek inside the bedroom where Escobar spent his final days or a look at the roof where he was killed, Colombia reports said.

Before it was purchased by Mr Restrepo in 2008 the property was abandoned and had fallen into disrepair while it was occupied by drug users and homeless people.

Thieves stripped the house of almost everything, including its electrical cords and light switches, and even ripped open walls hoping to find cash or objects left behind by the drug lord.

With his wealth, Pablo Escobar built a luxurious Medellin estate known as Hacienda Napoles

After extensive renovations the house was listed for sale in 2012 but was taken off the market.

Earlier this year, restaurant owner Christian Berdouare paid nearly £6m for a Miami Beach mansion once owned by the cocaine kingpin.

Mr Berdouare planned to tear down the coral pink house, seized by US officials in the late 1980s, and rebuild.
