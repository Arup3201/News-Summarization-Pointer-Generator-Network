A man's relaxing nightly shower sparked a horrific knife attack inside his own home, hospitalising him for four days with life-threatening injuries.

Scott Hogan, 19, was stabbed twice in the back with a steak knife by his flatmate Matthew George Chandler, 21, in a 'spur-of-the-moment' attack on February 7 last year.

Mr Chandler was reportedly fuming with Mr Hogan over his love of a long hot shower when the brutal incident occurred at their Southport unit on Queensland's Gold Coast.

The court heard that after banging on the bathroom door of the Eugaree Street home to get Mr Hogan's attention, Mr Chandler shouted 'hurry up'.

What began as a fairly common falling out between flatmates soon turned nasty.

The court heard Mr Hogan first pulled out the knife when hustled out of the shower, confronting his flatmate and saying: 'Do you want some of this?'.

The court heard Mr Chandler then battered Mr Hogan with a skateboard, the Gold Coast Bulletin reported.

Another flatmate then pulled them apart.

But later Mr Hogan charged at Mr Chandler in the kitchen and pinned him by his throat to the wall, Southport District Court heard on Tuesday.

Mr Chandler grabbed a nearby steak knife and sunk it twice into Mr Hogan's back, leaving him with internal bleeding, the court was told.

Mr Chandler admitted in court to stabbing his flatmate and pleaded guilty to assault occasioning bodily harm with a weapon.

Barrister Alastair McDougall, who was representing Mr Chandler, explained: 'Heâ€™s very remorseful and his prospects of rehabilitation should be viewed as very good.'

Judge Clive Wall sentenced him to two years probation and did not record a conviction.

The housemates are no longer in contact.
