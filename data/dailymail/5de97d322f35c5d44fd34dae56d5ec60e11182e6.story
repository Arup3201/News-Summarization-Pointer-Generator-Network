David Moyes has been counted out of one of the plum jobs waiting to be filled at the end of the season.

Bayer Leverkusen would have been the perfect fit for relaunching the 50-year old Scot’s managerial career after the shock of being sacked just 10 months into his Old Trafford tenure.

They are on the look out for a new boss after firing former Liverpool defender Sami Hyypia earlier this month and are on course for a Champions League place. Additionally, Moyes spoke of his wish to manage a top German side in a recent interview.

But Sportsmail understands Leverkusen’s board have ruled him out on grounds of price and profile.

Ruled out: David Moyes is too expensive to be considered for the Bayer Leverkusen job

They want a younger coach in the mould of Borussia Dortmund’s Jurgen Klopp and are unwilling to pay any more than £1.2million a year for the right man. The initial response from the Bay Arena is that Moyes – like former Chelsea boss Roberto Di Matteo, who also briefly came under consideration – would be too expensive after earning £5m a year at United.

They are also unconvinced that Moyes, who turns 51 on Friday, fits into the category of coach they are looking for after making a policy decision to try and unearth the next Klopp and setting their sights on three targets.

One of the trio, 40-year old Thomas Tuchel, has already ruled himself out after declaring he intends spending at least one more season at Mainz, where he took over in August, 2009 and reeled off seven straight wins at the start of the 2010-11 season, including a victory at Bayern Munich.

But Red Bull Salzburg’s Roger Schmidt and Augsburg’s 39-year old coach Markus Weinzierl are still in the frame and look to be locked in a straight fight to succeed Hyypia.

Weinzierl’s stock has been steadily rising and reached new heights recently when his unfancied team beat Bayern to end the European champions’ remarkable 53-game unbeaten run, while Schmidt has suffered only six defeats in 47 games as Salzburg boss and has just steered them to the Austrian title by finishing an incredible 24 points ahead of Rapid Vienna.

News that Leverkusen are currently looking no further than those two may well come as a disappointment to Moyes, who admitted in an interview with France Football just 16 months ago: ‘I always had the hope of being a coach abroad,’ he said.

‘If I had the choice, I would probably go to Germany, in part because they have a mentality there that is similar to mine but also because I am fascinated by what happens in German football. They seem to have found a way of producing young players.’

Unfortunately for Moyes, they also seem to have found a way of producing young coaches, and Leverkusen are closing in on two of the brightest, rather than venturing further afield, for their next managerial appointment.
