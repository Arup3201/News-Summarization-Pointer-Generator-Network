Burly: Enforcers Tony Lawrence and David Riddick, pictured looking back, went to Jeffrey Ashfield's home armed with a High Court writ taken out against the millionaire

A wealthy businessman threatened two bailiffs with a shotgun after they tricked their way into his country home to seize over Â£1.2 million worth of property, a court heard.

The burly enforcers went armed with a High Court writ taken out against millionaire Jeffrey Ashfield, director of a company that sells aircraft and parts.

Tony Lawrence and David Riddick were refused entry when they arrived at the gates of 62-year-old Ashfield's home Hayselden Manor in Cranbrook, Kent, on July 31 last year.

But they found a gap in bushes surrounding the property, knocked down a fence and managed to reach the front door.

When Ashfield, whose business interests include Aircraft Avionics Parts Support Ltd, Aviation Capital Solutions Ltd and Chobham Engineering Ltd, answered the door he was served with the writ.

He still refused entry but allowed them into the house to photocopy the writ.

Once inside, Mr Lawrence and Mr Riddick saw their chance to start seizing property, Maidstone Crown Court heard.

Mr Lawrence told a judge: 'I said: "As I am in the house, we are going to have to levy on all the goods in the house.'

'Mr Ashfield was not very happy about this and said no, we couldn't. He tried to forcibly eject me. Mrs Ashfield appeared and asked us to leave.

'Mr Ashfield said if we didn't leave the premises he was going to get a gun. My colleague advised him it would not be a very good idea and if he did he would get himself in a lot of trouble.

'Mr Ashfield disappeared. Mrs Ashfield insisted we left and said we were trespassing and she would call the police. We told her we were not going to leave and if she wanted to call the police that was fine by us.

'Mr Ashfield appeared in the hallway with a double barrel shotgun. It was on his shoulder pointing in our direction in the firing position.

'He said: "Get out of my house." He pointed the gun towards my legs. He said: "If you don't get out I am going to shoot you in the legs.

'My reaction was: "That's fine, we will leave the house".

Asked by prosecutor Christopher May what was going through his mind, he replied: 'What was going through my mind was I was going to end up with no legs.'

The bailiffs left the house, called the police and waited outside the gates.

Mr Lawrence, who worked for Burlington Credit, denied a suggestion by William Clegg QC, defending, that they broke down a metre-high garden fence to get into the grounds.

Mr Riddick said of the gun incident: 'I could see by his face he meant it. I was in a bit of a state and panicking. I was scared.'

Mr Clegg told him: 'You could have been a couple of bandits.'

Ashfield admitted possessing a firearm with intent to cause fear of violence but disputed that he aimed the gun at the bailiffs.

His solicitor and son-in-law Lucas Pitts said the writ resulted from a civil action in which the businessman was one of the defendants.

He said of the bailiffs: 'I said it sounded like trespass. Their aim was to empty the house of everything they could lay their hands on. It was an unwarranted and insane idea.

'There was a Derby Bentley in one of the garages. Their eyes lit up at that point. A low loader was ordered (to take it away).'

The court heard Ashfield's wife Francesca had just finished breakfast when the bailiffs arrived.

Oil had been stolen from their property the previous day. The gun was used by their son for clay pigeon shooting.

Saying she felt 'extremely vulnerable', she maintained the bailiffs had broken in by forcing the stock fence and damaging the hawthorn and holly hedge.

Mrs Ashfield said she repeatedly asked them to leave the house before her husband told them: 'If I get a gun would that persuade you to leave?'

She heard him say: 'And now will you leave?'

'I looked over my right shoulder and he was pointing at the floor,' she added.

She denied that her husband either pointed the gun at the men or threatened to shoot one of them in the legs.

Ashfield was sentenced to six months imprisonment suspended for two years with 150 hours unpaid work after Judge Martin Joy found he could not be sure what position the gun was held in.

He said Ashfield, who also owns a gym in Brighton and is a co-driver in rallying with Vince Bristow, acted 'foolishly' by fetching the gun and could have calmed down at any stage.

But he added the two bailiffs had been equally foolish, and even 'deceptive'.

'I do not find that the criminal standard of proof has been satisfied and I sentence on the basis that the defendant unwisely, foolishly, brought in a gun which was broken and not loaded,' said the judge.

'The defendant did by his actions threaten the two bailiffs and his actions were foolish, overdramatic, grandstanding and the bailiffs were behaving in a foolish and deceptive way and were not really frightened.

'All the parties over-reacted in what may be described as a childish and foolish way.'

Judge Joy said Ashfield's behaviour would have caused fear but nothing like as first suggested by the bailiffs.

He added that use of a firearm to threaten or intimidate could not be tolerated and there had to be a deterrent sentence.

The bailiffs, he said, had broken into the property by knocking the fence down and going through the hedge.

Their 'misbehaviour' went further and had fuelled the situation. He described them as 'incompetent and belligerent' and said it seemed remarkable to suggest they were experienced bailiffs.

'They lacked the professionalism and any understanding of the regulations concerning what they were permitted to do and their evidence was contradictory,' he said.

'Their attitude inflamed the situation and they went into the house completely uninvited. Mr Ashfield undoubtedly considered genuinely that he had been tricked, as he had.'
