For many people approaching their 85th birthday, the ideal present is a jumper, socks or a new pair of slippers but Ken Partridge went for something altogether more adventurous.

The retired joiner, from Oldham, Greater Manchester, who has battled prostate cancer, celebrated the day by jumping out of a plane at 15,000ft.

Ken, who served with the Royal Army Medical Corps and was attached to the elite Ghurka regiment during his national service in 1947, vowed to do a parachute jump himself after seeing sky divers in action on TV.

After Ken got the go-ahead from his doctor he set up a Just Giving page with a sponsorship target of £2,000 to be donated to Cancer Research - he has already raised more than £700

Now a great grandfather, he used skills he had learned on a computer course he did for his 80th birthday in 2009 and build a Just Giving donation webpage in the hope of raising £2,000 for Cancer Research UK.

On the page Ken joked: 'It will be an 
exciting and thrilling experience for me, it will raise much needed 
money for a fantastic cause - and it will save money on burial costs 
should the chute fail to open!'

The widower first mentioned the idea to friends early last year and says they all thought he was mad and daughter Shirley Hutchinson, 60, also took some convincing.

Ken who has two children, five 
grandchildren and five great grandchildren, said: 'When I told Shirley 
about the skydive she was dead against it.

'She said "over my dead body will you do a sky dive". But she had to come round to the idea because I was so determined.

'She
 wouldn't come and watch me so I had to get my son Keith and my 
grand-daughter's husband to all come along. I'm sure they all think I am
 mad.

'My grandchildren kept 
saying "you're too old grandad" and others called me a daft old bugger 
but there was no way I wasn't going to do it once I had my mind set on 
it.

'My wife Alice died five 
years ago and if she was still here now I don't know what she would say.

'I don't think she would be letting me do it either. As far as I'm 
concerned you're never too old to do anything, you've just got to enjoy 
yourself.'

Last weekend Ken completed his mission at Cockerham, near Lancaster to raise money for cancer research - although daughter Shirley was too nervous to watch.

He added: 'I had seen people sky dive on the TV and in films and its something I had always wanted to do but never got round to it.

'Eighty-five is a milestone birthday and I just decided wanted to do something that I would never forget.

'I first mentioned it to my friends at the liberal club on my 84th birthday last year and they all thought I was mad.

'I don't think any of them thought I would go through with it. But then I rang around a few clubs to see if they would take me.

'Most of them only take people under 70 but then I found the Black Knights Parachute Centre. They said they would have me as long as I had a couple of tests and my consultant said it was ok.

'When I told my friends I had been for tests to see if I was fit enough to do it they all asked if I had gone to get my head tested too.'

After Ken got the go-ahead from his doctor he set up a Just Giving page with a sponsorship target of £2,000 to be donated to Cancer Research. He has already raised over £700 on his Just Giving page but says his fundraising isn't over yet.

He added: 'The skydive was absolutely fantastic. When we got up there it was freezing. It was about minus 20 outside but I was well prepared for it with all the gear.

'The free fall was out of this world. It was like nothing I had ever experienced.

'It was a clear blue sky and it was just amazing. I can't describe how it felt when I hit the ground. I would definitely do it again, no matter what my age is.'

'One of the instructors told me that I am only the second oldest person to have done the free fall with them because a few years ago a 93-year-old woman did it.

'That means I will just have to go back when I am 94 to make sure I beat her. I am looking at abseiling now. The skydive has given me the adrenaline bug, I'm definitely not going to stop yet.'
