Lawyers should be banned from offering inducements such as free iPads and shopping vouchers to encourage those involved in accidents to pursue compensation, MPs have said.

The call comes from the Commons Transport Select Committee in an attack on ambulance chasers who encourage frivolous whiplash claims that drive up insurance premiums for all.

The claims cost firms more than £2billion a year and add more than £90 to the average car insurance premium, according to industry experts.

Frivolous: Lawyers should be banned from offering inducements such as free iPads and shopping vouchers to encourage those involved in accidents to pursue compensation, MPs have said

Research dating back to 2012 has found evidence of some law firms 
offering car-crash victims free iPads or hundreds of pounds in cash or 
shopping vouchers to entice them to make personal injury claims.

Some firms have advertised the tablets and Debenhams vouchers on their 
websites. One was offering shopping vouchers to anyone who introduces an
 accident victim to them.

Steps taken by the Government to curb claims, such as a ban on solicitors paying referral fees to push cases their way, have been working.

But the committee says more needs to be done and is backing proposals by the Ministry of Justice for a further clampdown.

MPs also want a ban on payouts before whiplash claimants have been checked by an independent doctor. And they recommend that solicitors should be prevented from using their own medical experts to verify claims.

There are also concerns that some solicitors are bumping up their fees by sending claimants for psychological assessment in order to boost the size of the claim.

In a report published today, the MPs state: ‘Inducements to claim 
are likely to have encouraged fraudulent claims so we support the 
Government’s intention to ban them.’

MPs said the Solicitors Regulatory Authority should act to stop lawyers from ‘playing the system to maximise their income from unnecessary medical reports’.

Committee chairman, Louise Ellman MP, said: ‘Further action is still required to tackle fraud whilst protecting genuine claimants.’

She added: ‘Solicitors must be banned from generating more work by offering inducements, such as cash or tablet computers, to encourage people to make a claim.’

The MPs have endorsed a Government plan to change the law to require courts to strike out ‘dishonest’, specifically those that gross exaggeration.

MPs first began looking at motor insurance premiums in 2011 following an extraordinary increase in claims that saw premiums for motorists rising at an astonishing rate of around 30per cent a year. Men were typically paying £2,457, while the figure for women was £1,423.

Efforts to highlight the scandal and take some of the costs out of the legal process have had positive results. According to the AA, average premiums fell by 16.6per cent in the year to March 2012 and are now lower than at any time since late 2010.
