A mother of 34 children has given a rare insight into the day-to-day running of her one-of-a-kind household.

During the past 30 years, Jeane Briggs and her husband Paul, have adopted 29 children from around the world and, alongside their five biological children, have happily opened up their home in Falling Waters, West Virginia, to the youngsters, many of whom suffer from serious illnesses or disabilities.

'I just enjoy it. This is my career. I say to my kids, you’re the very air I breathe so I need you, I need that oxygen,' Mrs Briggs, 58, told Today.com.

In fact, the Briggs family have no plans to stop welcoming children into their home, and are especially devoted to those who are older or hard to place because of disabilities or illnesses.

They've cared for children with cancer, polio, scoliosis, leg deformities, kidney problems, learning disabilities and autism, among other medical conditions.

Their son Joseph, now 24, recalls being abused as a child in Ukraine because he was born with a cleft lip and palate, before the Briggs adopted him at age 14.

Around the world: The Briggs, who live in Falling Waters, West Virginia, have adopted children from Mexico, Russia, Ukraine, Bulgaria and Ghana

'It was hard to believe that someone wanted me with my problem. I can't repay them for what they did for me… I love my parents to the moon and back,' he said.

The first international child they adopted was Abraham, a blind two-year-old whom they rescued from a Mexican orphanage in 1985. He had brain damage due to having been beaten.

While it's quite expensive to feed such a large brood - the family spends $52,000 a year on groceries alone - Mr Briggs, 59, is fortunate to have a very lucrative job at a credit card processing company. His employer also pays the family $10,000 for every child they adopt.

True calling: 'This is my career. I say to my kids, you’re the very air I breathe so I need you, I need that oxygen,' Mrs Briggs said

They were also able to expand their nine-bedroom, 5,000-square-foot house, where 26 people currently live, with money from a recent inheritance.

In 2003, Mrs Briggs, then a mother of 12, told the Herald-Mail that anyone hesitant to take in an older child should visit her family.

'Children are special gifts, blessings. No child should learn or feel that nobody wants them,' she said. 'It's such a joy. Honestly, I've never had a bad day.'
