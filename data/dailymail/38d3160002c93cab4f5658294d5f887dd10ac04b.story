Jose Mourinho had his Chelsea stars training under the lights as they look to maintain their unbeaten start to the season at Newcastle on Saturday.

The novel approach could be seen by the Blues boss as a tactic to keep his players on their toes as they've dispatched all that's before them after 14 Premier League games of the season so far.

Eden Hazard and Didier Drogba, fresh from their goalscoring exploits against Tottenham on Wednesday night, both took in the club's session at their Cobham base.

Despite his strike against Spurs, Drogba is likely to lose who spot in the starting line-up to Diego Costa - who is available for selection following his one-match suspension.

Mourinho will also be boosted by the news that Gary Cahill is fit to face the Magpies despite picking up a head knock against Spurs, while the Portuguese has a decision to make in midfield with Ramires and John Mikel Obi competing to replace the suspended Nemanja Matic.

Ahead of the trip to Tyneside, Mourinho has heightened the pre-match build-up to the fixture by accusing their opponents of only playing to their potential when they face his side.

The Portuguese has never won at St James' Park and insists that Alan Pardew's outfit are one of several teams which raise their game against the Blues.

'It's difficult, a difficult stadium to play at. There are a few stadiums in this country where, clearly, when they see the Chelsea shirts, they play the game of their lives,' he said at the Blues' pre-match press conference on Friday.

'When they play against other teams they look like they're playing friendlies. Maybe this is because Chelsea, in the last decade, became a strong team that everybody wants to beat.'

Mourinho also insists club records are the least of his concerns as he looks to guide his team to the Premier League title.

Chelsea's 3-0 win against Tottenham on Wednesday night saw the Stamford Bridge club equal a club record 23-game unbeaten run.

But Mourinho refused to praise himself or his team for achieving the feat while revealing the only record he's interested in is being the first Blues boss to win the Premier League three times.

'I don't care about it (unbeaten record). I'm not looking for records. I'm looking for points, victories and hopefully at the end of the season title,' he added.

'The only record I want is to win the Premier League three times in this club. That's the only thing that matter to me.'
