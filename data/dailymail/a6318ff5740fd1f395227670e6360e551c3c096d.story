A 2ft snake that had been missing for two months escaped into a neighbour's home and wrapped itself around her dinner tray as she sat down to eat.Â 

Carol Ormes said she screamed in terror when she finally spotted the corn snake, named Bam Bam, coiled around the tray.

The 11-month-old snake had been missing from neighbour Karina Peek's vivarium since it escaped two months ago.

A second snake is also on the loose and Mrs Ormes, 54, said she now fears it will also show up in her house.

She said Bam Bam blended in so well with the wooden handle of her tray that she went to put her plate down on it.

Mrs Ormes, from Laindon in Essex, said: 'I noticed this face looking at me and I just screamed.

'My husband thought I was overreacting as he thought it was a spider. I just launched the tray at him and ran into the kitchen.'

Ms Peek, 31, had given up all hope of finding Bam Bam, one of eight snakes that she looks after with her two children, Chloe, 13, and Jason, nine.

She was overjoyed to find out he had been found on Friday, June 14.

She said: 'I couldn't believe it, I was ecstatic as I didn't think I would see him again.

'As I have gone in I saw Carol in the kitchen and didn't think anything of it but looking back she did look really startled.'

Mrs Ormes said: 'I can laugh about it
now. I didn't realise how big he was, if I had seen the whole length of
it I would be in hospital with a heart attack.'

She said she was in hysterics and has no idea how the snake got into her semi-detached home.

Ms Peek said corn snakes are known for being 'escape artists' but her son had not shut the vivarium properly which left a small gap for him to slither out of.

Although the family are thrilled to have Bam Bam home, they are still hoping daughter Chloe's bright pink corn snake, Elektra, may turn up - she escaped a month before Bam Bam.

Ms Peek added: 'The house literally got demolished to try and find these snakes.

'Jason is pleased because at least it's not his fault any more, but Chloe's gutted it wasn't Elektra that was found.'

Mrs Ormes now fears the other snake may turn up elsewhere in her home.

She added: 'I feel a bit apprehensive now, I think the other is in here too.'

Corn snakes, which are native to North America, can grow up to 6ft long and prey on rodents, killing them by constriction.

Their reluctance to bite makes them popular pets, and in captivity they can live to be up to 23 years old.
