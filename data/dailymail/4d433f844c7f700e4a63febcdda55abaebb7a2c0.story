Two women who slashed a man's throat and stabbed him to death before claiming they had been raped have been found guilty of murder.

Alicia Davis and Charlotte Coulson were travelling in the car of Michael Kerr when they stabbed him in the neck and chest repeatedly before leaving him to die in Satmar Lane, Caple-le-Ferne near Folkestone.

Davis was jailed for a minimum of 25 years and Coulson for a minimum of 20 years today by a judge who said they had taken 'perverse pleasure' in killing the 30-year-old.

The Old Bailey heard how the women threw the victim's mobile phone away and burned their clothing after returning to the home of Coulson, 22, in an attempt to destroy evidence.

But police found Mr Kerr had been in extensive phone and text message contact with the pair in the hours leading up to his death. 

Coulson had contacted Mr Kerr on April 9 claiming Davis was prepared to have sex with him for cash as the pair tried to make money to buy alcohol, according to the police spokesman.

Mr Kerr picked Davis up in his yellow Renault Clio at 8pm and drove to Satmar Lane before dropping her at Coulson's home, police said.

Just after midnight on April 10, Coulson and Mr Kerr had a heated conversation through text messages and decided to meet up again, the spokesman continued.

Evidence gathered by officers found a text message from Coulson to Davis, sent during the journey which said: 'Start now', to which Davis replied: 'Ur gonna have to do it first'.

In her last text Coulson said to Davis: 'Shut up n hurry up let’s party.’

Mr Kerr was left lying dead next to his car as the two women walked home.

Davis messaged Coulson after the murder saying: ‘I feel so sick, I love you.’

The women then attacked Mr Kerr inside his car with at least one knife before walking back to Dover and leaving him to die in the country lane, the court heard.

A post-mortem examination found he died from multiple stab wounds to his neck and chest, and had also sustained injuries consistent with self-defence.

Coulson then sent Mr Kerr several text messages asking why he had not been in contact despite having killed him, the spokesman said.

The two women were arrested after confiding in other friends.

Coulson claimed she was asleep in the back of the car when she had awoken to find him attacking Davis, while Davis told detectives he had attacked her and she stabbed him in self-defence.

Detective Chief Inspector Paul Fotheringham, of the Kent and Essex Serious Crime Directorate, said: 'This was a violent and vicious attack in which Michael didn't stand a chance.

'He was used to giving his friends a lift to places - he was a nice person and loved driving his car.

'But what he didn't know that night was Coulson and Davis were luring him to his death.

'Text messages show they were planning their sustained attack right up until they arrived in Satmar Lane.'

A family statement said: 'Michael was the innocent victim of a ruthless and brutal, unprovoked attack which has resulted in him being taken from his family and friends.

'The pain we have experienced and are still suffering from cannot be expressed in words. Michael was a loving and caring son, brother and grandson who we miss terribly every day.

'Today's verdict, whilst not bringing him back has provided us with some comfort knowing that those responsible for his death will serve a number of years in prison, however no sentence can ever come close to the pain that Michael has endured.'
