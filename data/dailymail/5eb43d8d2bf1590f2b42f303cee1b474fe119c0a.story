A grandfather who was left with a permanent scowl after suffering nerve damage in his face is smiling again - after having leg tissue implanted into his cheeks.

John Smith, 58, had a drooping mouth following an operation to remove a 5mm-long benign tumour from his ear in 2005.

A nerve was damaged during the surgery leaving him suffering from facial paralysis and unable to smile.

It also left him unable to fully close his eyes.

John Smith can now smile again after 20 operations including surgery to transplant leg tissue into his cheek

He has now undergone 20 operations, including three facelifts, and a ‘smile transplant’ which involved having tissue from his leg implanted into the corners of his mouth.

He also had surgery to insert two small gold weights into his eyelids so he could sleep with his eyes properly shut.

Mr Smith, an accountant from Halesowen, West Midlands, said: ‘It’s changed my life. I literally haven’t been able to stop smiling since the operation was deemed a success.

‘I didn’t want to go out because people stared at me and kids asked what the matter was. Now it’s just normal to look at me.

‘It’s taken a long time, it’s been about eight years but it’s come right.

‘It’s been worth it, there’s no doubt about that. It’s changed my life.

‘I thought I’d never be able to smile again. Now I can talk to people and have a laugh and joke with them and they know now that I’m smiling.

‘The things they can do nowadays are unbelievable.

Mr Smith says that he was always laughing and smiling before a nerve in his face was damaged during tumour removal surgery

‘I thought I’d never be able to smile again.

‘The entire right side of my face was left drooping and I stopped smiling completely.’

He added: ‘Even when I was happy or laughing at a joke I still looked grumpy. It was horrible.

‘People felt awkward around me because I couldn’t laugh along or smile at jokes.

‘I used to laugh all the time, but I wasn’t able to do that anymore.

‘The worst thing was when it came to having my picture taken and trying to smile for the camera.

The grandfather, who is pictured with his wife Lesley, says that he avoided going out before his reconstructive surgery as people would stare at him

‘Children would stare at me and then ask their mum loudly “what’s wrong with that man?”

‘In the end I used my hand to prop up my cheek so it was less noticeable.

‘I used to walk around with my hand stuck to my face because I was so conscious about my face.’

Mr Smith’s nightmare began in May 2005 when he was refereeing a football match and noticed ringing in his ears and began suffering balance problems.

He underwent an MRI scan which found he had a benign acoustic neuroma - a tumour - in his ear.

Following surgery Mr Smith is now able to share a joke with his wife again

In October that year the tumour was removed, but a nerve was damaged and he suffered facial palsy – paralysis of the face.

After three facelifts at Birmingham’s Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Mr Smith was referred to Demetrius Evriviades, a consultant Plastic and Reconstructive Microsurgeon.

He operated on Mr Smith twice in 2007 and again in 2008 to transplant tissue from his leg into his cheek.

Both operations failed but the third transplant in November 2009 was deemed a success and Mr Smith started intensive physiotherapy to strengthen his facial muscles.

The grandfather, who lives with his wife of 33 years, Lesley, 56, added: ‘When Demetrius first looked at my face, he said “we will sort it out”. And I trusted him.

‘My smile finally came back bit by bit as I had the physio.

‘I had to clench my teeth to smile at first. Then the whole face started to move.

‘Now I can talk to people and have a laugh and joke with them and they know now that I am smiling.

‘The nicest thing for me now is that I can once again smile at my wife. It was depressing not being able to share a laugh with her for so many years.’

Mr Evriviades said: ‘It is quite a rare operation, I have carried out only eight in total.

‘With John, both the nerves and muscle in the affected side of the face had gone, so we needed to bring in a new muscle and use another nerve.

Plastic and Reconstructive Microsurgeon Demetrius Evriviades inserted tiny gold weights into Mr Smith's eyelids to allow him to close his eyes properly again

‘It takes about three months for the nerve to recover and the muscle starts to work.

‘To achieve the best results it takes a lot of hard work and physiotherapy after the operation as the patient learns how to smile again.

‘Initially the patient has to bite their teeth to smile but fairly soon they learn to do it without biting their teeth.

‘John now has a spontaneous smile.’
