A young girl has staked her claim to be named the world's 'most talented' person after pulling a car weighing one-and-a-half tonnes with her hair.

Representing her home country of Morocco for a new reality TV programme, Ikram Salhi showcased her special talent when she dragged the Mercedes-Benz across 32ft of flat road.

She accomplished the amazing feat with the strength of her body after ropes were attached to her ponytail and the front end of the car.

As Ikram prepares for the challenge, narrator Jonathon Ross tells viewers: ‘Public stunts like this are hugely popular throughout Morocco but it’s rarely a woman displaying such strength.’ 

Ikram then assumes a crouching position and begins taking small steps as the crowd around her applauds in encouragement.

As the car starts to inch forward, Ikram stretches out her arms in front of her and picks up speed.

Despite her slight build the young girl increases her pace and surges forward with the car following obediently behind.

Spectators watched in astonishment as the girl dragged the Mercedes-Benz across 32ft of flat road

After pulling the car a gruelling 32ft, Ikram is greeted with a handshake from shocked presenter David Brain.

Discussing the feat, Ikram said: ‘I don’t feel anything when pulling the car. It doesn’t hurt.

‘I’m proud to honour the Moroccan women in my country, and I hope to be the strongest woman in Morocco.’

David was full of awe for the talented and modest competitor.

He said: ‘It sounds so simple, I don’t know how she does this. It looks great.’

Ikram has been performing stunts of this calibre since the age of nine and says that the heaviest item she has ever pulled was a 4x4 Range Rover. 

Ikram will go head-to-head against a competitor from Germany in a programme airing April 28 at 9pm on Watch.
