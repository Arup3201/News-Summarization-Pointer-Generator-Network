When England arrive at the Arena Amazonia in Manaus on Saturday, the magnitude of what liesahead will hit them. As will the heat — and humidity.

Roy Hodgson’s men can expect temperatures of around 32 degrees when they face Italy, as well as humidity levels of 76 per cent.

So, in search of a realistic idea of what Steven Gerrard and Co will be forced to endure against the Italians, I made my way to Canary Wharf.

Getting ready: Sportsmail's Sami Mokbel prepares to tackle the Lucozade Manaus conditions fitness test

Entering: Sami takes to the pitch and immediately feels the 32 degree heat

In the mix: Sami on the pitch ready to test the same heat England players will play in at the World Cup

Not 
particularly tropical, you might say. But Lucozade’s Conditions Zone has
 brought a taste of the Brazilian rainforest to east London.

The 
temporary indoor facility, which has its own 3G pitch, replicates the 
temperature and humidity in Brazil — in this case Manaus.

The plan 
was to complete the Hoff Test — a 10-minute intensive endurance test 
which incorporates work with a football — before going into a 
small-sided game. In preparation, on-site specialists checked my weight and hydration levels.

And then it hits you square in the face — the heat. As you walk into the Conditions Zone, it’s like stepping into a sauna. Within seconds, I was sweating — and that was before I had even started.

Not to be boastful, I like to think I’m pretty fit. I exercise at least five times a week and watch my diet. But nothing could prepare me for what was to come.

The Hoff Test is a series of runs, sprints and jumps with and without the ball. Five minutes in, I was gasping for air, desperate for the second half of the test to pass.

You try not to slow down, but you can’t help but take your foot off the gas. It felt like my lungs would
burst if I didn’t.

Getting going: Mokbel did a series of runs, sprints and jumps with and without the ball to test himself in the heat

By the end I was drenched in sweat, gasping for air with legs like jelly. Utterly exhausted — and that was after 10 minutes.

The main thing that struck me was my lack of control over the ball as time wore on.

Zig-zagging
 in and out of cones during the first two or three minutes was fine, but
 the quality with the ball at my feet gradually plummeted.

You try to ensure that your touches are assured, but all I could really think about was: ‘When can I stop?’

Next came the small-sided game. It was only 10 minutes, but after the Hoff Test it was 10 minutes too long.

The final tests: Sami says 'the final whistle was a sweet, sweet sound' after a tormenting challenge

Pacing myself was the key here, but shaking off what went before was easier said than done.

The speed 
of the game dropped dramatically towards the end, every player petrified
 that a misplaced pass would lead to an unnecessary burst of speed to retrieve the ball.

The final whistle was a sweet, sweet sound, as was the moment I stepped out of the Condition Zone and into the east London air.

I lost a kilo in weight and 1.5 litres of fluid in just 20 minutes.

So what effect will 90 minutes of play in the Amazon rainforest at Manaus, chasing 11 Italians, have on England on Saturday?

The weigh-in: Sami lost a kilo in weight and 1.5 litres of fluid in just 20 minutes in the heat

Results: How will England players fare after 90 minutes of chasing 11 Italians on Saturday?
