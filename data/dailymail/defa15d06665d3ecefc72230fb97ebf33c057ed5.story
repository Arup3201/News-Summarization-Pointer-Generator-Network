A mother-of-three who sparked controversy this week after posting a photograph of her toned body to Facebook, captioned: 'What's your excuse?', has spoken out in defence of the image.

Maria Kang, 32, from Los Angeles, California, told the Today show this morning that the majority of the 16million people who viewed the picture found it 'inspiring', prompting them to embrace the attitude 'if she can do it, so can I.'

Revealing the secret to her enviable figure the stay-at-home working mother said: 'I not a personal trainer and I just make [exercise] a priority.'

I'm an inspiration: Maria Kang, a mother-of-three who sparked controversy this week after posting a photograph of her toned body to Facebook, captioned: 'Wha''s your excuse?', has defended the image

The pretty brunette says that she likes to do 30 to 60 minutes of strength training and cardio every morning, five to six days a week.

On a typical day she tries to get to the gym by 6.30am and then returns home to 'feed, clean and play' with her sons.

She then focuses attention on the non-profit business she runs, Fitness without Borders, which promotes fitness education in schools and local communities.

'I built the stamina, I've given birth three years in a row, I can do this,' she said of her hectic schedule.

Source of controversy: The exercise-loving mother posted this photograph to Facebook - while many commentators cited her as an 'inspiration' some also accused her of being 'insulting'

In her controversial image Ms Kang appears knelt alongside her three young sons dressed in a workout bra and matching micro shorts.

Is this exercise-loving mother asking 'What's your excuse?' offensive or inspiring?

While many of the 17,000-plus 
commentators cited her as an 'inspiration' some also accused her of 
being 'insulting', 'obnoxious' and a 'fat shaming bully'.

Indeed, one woman wrote: 'You are . . . hurtful to women and think way too much of yourself. Disgusting is what you are!'

And a mother-of-two named Sarah added on Ms Kang's website, mariakang.com: 'I hope you realize why some people are not just offended, but also hurt by your post as well.

'First: many of us end up with stretch marks after kids…. A LOT OF THEM! I have two kids and both have caused my skin to stretch soo bad my stomach, from my rib cage straight down the the middle of my vaginal area, look like the U.S. road atlas.

Keeping fit and healthy: Ms Kang said that she didn't intend to upset people and she hoped the photo would inspire others to feel better about themselves

'Second: I am an avid runner. I run my
two kids in a double jogger. Do I look like a runner? Nope. As a matter
of fact, unless people know me, they don't believe me. I do half and 
full marathons.  

She concludes: 'People like you who post pictures like this make people like me cry because I know that without surgery to lose the extra skin I will never look like you.

this make me cry because I know that without surgery I will never look like you'

'So what’s my excuse? I do not have the same great genetics you do.'

However, Ms Kang says that she did not 
intend to upset people and she hoped the photo would inspire others to 
feel better about themselves.

'I knew it was going to be a powerful image,' Ms Kang told Today.

Responding to critics, she wrote an apology on Facebook reading: 'I'm sorry you took an image and resonated with it in such a negative way.

'I won't go into details that I struggled with my genetics, had an eating disorder, work full time owning two business', have no nanny, am not naturally skinny and do not work as a personal trainer.

Breaking a sweat: The pretty brunette says that she likes to do 30 to 60 minutes of strength training and cardio every morning, five to six days a week

'I won't even mention how I didn't give 
into cravings for ice cream, french fries or chocolate while pregnant or
use my growing belly as an excuse to be inactive.

'What I WILL say is this. What you 
interpret is not MY fault. It's Yours. The first step in owning your 
life, your body and your destiny is to OWN the thoughts that come out of
your own head.

'Maybe it's time we stop tip-toeing around people's feelings and get to the point.'

‘I wanted to say, “I know you think you don't have time if you have kids. But if I can do it, you can do it, too’"

She notes that she does have 
stretchmarks and excess skin from three pregnancies but these 'scars' 
encourage her to 'keep striving' and 'never stop'.

'Motherhood is beautiful AND it can make you better!' she adds.

Her 'what's your excuse?' image has received over 17million views on Facebook, since it was posted a year ago.

She decided to re-post it to her 100,000-plus followers last month, tacking on an apology, after she noticed it was attracting dozens of negative comments.

Lots of hard work: Ms Kang says that it took years for her to get into shape after battling an eating disorder, struggling with her genetics and having three children

‘I wanted to inspire people. I wanted to say, “I know you think you don’t have time if you have kids. But if I can do it, you can do it, too,’” she said.

It's not the first time a fitness-oriented mom has sparked controversy.

Just last month, eight-and-a-half-month pregnant Lea-Anne Ellison received a barrage of criticism after posting a photo of herself lifting weights during a CrossFit workout.
