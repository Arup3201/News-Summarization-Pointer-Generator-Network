Shocking photographs have emerged of suspected criminal with their head and mouths taped shut by Chinese police in order to prevent them concocting alibis.

Officers who arrested this group in Guangdong province, in southwest China, sealed their mouths with extra powerful adhesive sticky tape to prevent them from talking to each other.

A police spokesman said the move would
stop people being quizzed by detectives with the story all worked out 
along the lines of 'I didn't do it... honestly'.

In total 23 members of the criminal gang in Huizhou were seized in gambling dens in the city earlier this month.

A police spokesman said: 'It is the 
easiest and most effective way of making sure they don't talk to one 
another before we could get them in the cells.

'It
is our experience in situations like this that they jaw away to get 
their stories straight, work out their alibis and cover one another's 
backs.

'This way they are all dumb until we can question them individually, and each of them doesn't know what the other has said.'

According to police, the taped up men shown here are suspected of committing over 100 robberies and thefts in the region in recent months.

They were arrested after a major surveillance operation on the mah-jong clubs where they hung out during the day.

'We can't help it if people think we are infringing on human rights by doing this,' added a police spokesman.

'It's up to them what they think, but actually we think more of the human rights of their victims and their desire to live in peace without criminals preying on them.'
