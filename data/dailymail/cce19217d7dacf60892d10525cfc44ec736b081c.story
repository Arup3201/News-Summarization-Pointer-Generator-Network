When this happy couple decided to hold their wedding reception in a zoo, they thought things might turn a bit wild.

But even they didn't expect their official wedding photos to be gatecrashed by a tiger.

Andrew Madgwick, 25, and bride Karma, 30, were posing for pictures at their reception at Paignton Zoo, in Devon, when Banda the Sumatran tiger suddenly wandered into shot.

Luckily the newlyweds were protected by a glass barrier but photographer Vicki Boulter seized her chance to capture the funny image.

The picture shows the happy couple gazing into each other's eyes - as the big cat peers at the camera between them.

Ms Boulter, of Torquay, Devon, said: 'We were having a walk around the park and we decided to go over to look at the viewing platform.

'One of the tigers was sunbathing on the ledge when Karma shook her dress and caught its attention.

'All of a sudden it came bounding over and right into the shot. It posed for a split second and then walked away.

'Karma and Andrew didn't quite realise the tiger had come so close as I was getting them to pose. But they were delighted when they saw the photo.'

Karma, a performing arts teacher, and Andrew, a videographer, had married at Bishops Court in Exeter before heading to the zoo for their reception.

Banda, a female, and male Tenang are the zoo's two endangered Sumatran tigers.
