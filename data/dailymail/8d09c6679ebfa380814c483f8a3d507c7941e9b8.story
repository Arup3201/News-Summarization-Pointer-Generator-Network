Microsoft has announced it will launch an update to the latest version of its Windows operating system - Windows 8 - because of complaints about how difficult the software is to use. 

The mover, seen by many as a U-turn, is part of a software package that has been given the codename, 'Blue'.

However, the update won't be released to consumers and businesses until later this year.

The homescreen on Windows 8 is made up of interactive tiles that you use your mouse or finger to swipe across. This layout was designed for touchscreen devices, yet PC and mouse users have criticised it for being too difficult to use. Many have called for a return to the desktop view as seen in previous versions of the Windows operating system

Windows 8 has interactive 
tiles and swiping menus that were designed to work best on touchscreen devices.

PC and mouse users have heavily criticised this because it is difficult to get used

Another common complaint has centered on the lack of a 'start' button in the Windows 8 menu.

Other critics want the system to boot
up in desktop mode by default, instead of showing the mosaic of 
interactive tiles that you need to swipe through, and were designed to 
be used on touchscreen devices.

Windows 8 was released last October and was a major overhaul in terms of design, compared to previous versions.

Many users have criticised it for being too difficult to use, and the Blue update is expected to respond to these complaints.

Tami Reller, Windows' marketing and financial chief, told the FT 'key aspects' of the software would be changed.

'The learning curve is definitely real,' she admitted.

Microsoft hasn't said whether it will charge existing Windows 8 users to get the update, or when it will be available, although it is expected around October.

More details about Blue 
will be released before Microsoft's developer conference in San 
Francisco in late June.

Some of Blue's features are also expected to be 
previewed at this conference.

Microsoft hoped Windows 8 would play a more 
prominent role in the growing mobile market while still 
maintaining its dominance in PCs.

Research firm, 
International Data Corp said Windows 8 contributed to a 14 percent 
decline in worldwide PC sales during the first three months of the year -
the biggest year-over-year drop ever.

Meanwhile, sales of smartphones and tablet computers are booming.

The biggest beneficiaries have been 
Apple, with its iPhone and iPad, and Samsung, which sells the most mobile devices running Google's Android 
software.

Microsoft launched its first 10.6 inch tablet, called the Surface, last October. It was the first tablet to launch running a mobile version of the Windows 8 operating system. Rumours suggest that with the 'Blue' update, Microsoft may be looking at releasing smaller versions of this device later this year

Google is also benefiting from Android's popularity through 
increased traffic to its services.

By contrast, leading PC makers such 
as Hewlett-Packard and Dell, which primarily sell 
Windows-powered machines, have seen a drop in sales and suffered slumps in stock values.

Despite this, Microsoft insists it's pleased with Windows 8's performance.

The company claims more than 100 million Windows 8 licenses have been 
sold so far, up from about 60 million licenses in January.

According to Tami Reller, the licensing
volume 'is in the same general ballpark,' as Windows 7 - Microsoft's previous 
operating system.

Sales of smartphones and tablet computers are booming, while PC sales are slumping. According to marketing firm IDC, sales of the iPad passed 141m last year

Reller said Blue is being released because Microsoft realised changes need to be made to make Windows 8 
easier to use.

She added that Blue will also improve Windows 8's ability to work on smaller tablets 
with 7- and 8-inch display screens.

Although she declined to say 
whether Microsoft intends to make smaller version of its own Surface 
tablets.

Microsoft founder Bill Gates has also 
predicted that the company's fortunes will be buoyed by iPad users switching to Windows 8 tablets.

During an 
interview with CNBC, Gates
said: 'Users of iPad and Android tablets might not have noticed, but a 
lot of them are 'frustrated' because they 'can't type, they can't create
documents, they don't have [Microsoft] Office there.'

Since April 2012, iPad sales have passed 141m.

According to market intelligence firm IDC, total 
tablet sales have reached 253m, and less than 2m of those are for Microsoft's Surface tablet.

Analysts
say one reason Windows 8 got off to a slow start is because there 
weren't enough devices designed to take advantage of the system's 
touch-screen features.

Robert
Rutherford, managing director of specialist IT consultancy, QuoStar 
Solutions, added: 'Windows 8 was a failure of timing, not of design.

Bill Gates, the founder of the Microsoft Corporation, believes that many iPad users are 'frustrated'. He claims that because they can't type on their tablets, they will ultimately switch to devices running Microsoft Office and Windows 8, such as the company's Surface tablet which launched last October

'Microsoft has set itself up in 2013 as a source of creativity and innovation, the problem is that the new vibe doesn’t yet gel with what users know and expect from the brand.

'On this occasion Microsoft pushed the envelope too much, but the time for these innovations will come.

'It’s important that Microsoft keeps doing what it’s doing to provide a challenge to Apple’s creative dominance.'

Given how different that Windows 8 is from its predecessors, Reller said Microsoft always knew it might have to make some adjustments less than a year after the software came out.

'It had to be a very big change to take advantage of the mobile opportunity,' she said. 

'As we look at Windows 8, it's important to remember a lot of its full potential won't be realised until there are more touch devices on the market,' Reller said.
