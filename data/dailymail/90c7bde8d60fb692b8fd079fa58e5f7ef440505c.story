The bodies of five dead babies have been found hidden in a house in France - four in the freezer and one in a portable cooler.

Police made the macabre discovery after a 40-year-old father called them at 7am in the town of Louchats, in the south west, close to Bordeaux.

In what is believed to be the worst case of infanticide in the country this century, the farmer first of all said he had found a tiny body in the thermally insulated container, one normally used to keep cold drinks.

Officers searched the premises, and found four more babies in a large freezer regularly used by the family.

The man's wife was immediately sedated and rushed to hospital, while the husband, who is a farmer, was arrested so he could be questioned at length. Neither has yet been identified.

'The first body was a newborn,' said a source close to the investigation which has been opened into the horrific case.

It is believed that the woman had 'secretly given birth, within the last 48 hours', without telling anybody.

The husband was said to be 'absolutely devastated and shaking uncontrollably' when the discoveries were made.

The couple have two daughters, aged 13 and 15, who were thought to have been present when the first body was discovered. They are now in the care of the police, supported by social workers.

There will be DNA tests to confirm the children's parentage.

Locals who had seen the woman recently said there were no signs that she was pregnant.

And a relative of the father said that he was not aware either and was in a state of complete shock at the discovery of the dead babies.

The town's mayor Philip Carreyre, who went with police to the scene, said: 'I will not say anything about this. The only thing I can point out is that these are good people perfectly integrated in the town.'

The father runs a small business maintaining gardens.

Pathologists need to establish whether the babies, all apparently self-delivered in secret, were stillborn or died soon after birth.  

The first baby found in a cool bag was 'viable' (capable of life) it was revealed tonight.  

Deputy Prosecutor in the High Court of Bordeaux, Anne Kayanakis, told a press conference: 'It is not yet possible to say whether this was a full term birth. Further analysis is needed to determine the cause of death.'

Post mortems on the four other newborns discovered in a freezer will take place tomorrow. Depending on the results prosecutors will determine the nature of any criminal charges.

'Nothing has been established,' said Kayanakis. 'This is a particularly heavy and delicate investigation and a highly serious matter.'

She said biological and genetic analysis was on going to determine the relationship of the babies in the case.

But she said, the mother had immediately admitted to police giving birth to the child two days before he was found. She had now been placed in a psychiatric hospital.

Meanwhile In Louchats, villagers were still in shock at the news that has unfolded.

The couple and their two daughters were described as 'just a normal family.'

Said one resident: 'Knowing them it is just unbelievable. They are discreet people who never posed any problems. Just people who get up every morning and go to work.

'We're all just stunned.'

France has a sinister history of dead babies being found in freezers. In 2013 a 32-year-old waitress from Amberieu- en-Bugey, in the east of the country, admitted drowning her two newborns and placing their bodies in one.

She had previous convictions for similar crimes and was sentenced to 15 years for infanticide. Her mother, who had helped her in the crimes, got an 18 year sentence.

In November 2012 a three-month-old boy and a five-year-old girl were found dead in a freezer in Vienne, Isere. The mother was also found dead, while the father fled to Tunisia.

And in March 2003 police in Tinteniac, Brittany, found the body of a new-born baby in a freezer and the remains of three other children buried in the garden of the house. The mother was later given a 15-year prison sentence.

Such cases are often linked to 'pregnancy denial', where women refuse to accept that they are in fact pregnant.
