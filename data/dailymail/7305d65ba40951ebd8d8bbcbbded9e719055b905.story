Prince Harry today led tributes to Nelson Mandela as it emerged a memorial stone will be laid for the former South Africa in Westminster Abbey.

Almost 2,000 people gathered at the abbey this lunchtime for a memorial service to the late leader's life and work.

Mr Mandela, who died on December 5 last 
year, was welcomed to the abbey in July 1996 when, during a state visit,
 he laid a wreath at the Grave of the Unknown Warrior.

Prince Harry represented the Queen at today's 
service, which was also attended by actor Idris Elba who played Mandela 
in a biopic last year

Ahead of the service it was announced that a memorial stone to Nelson Mandela will be laid in Westminster Abbey

Prime Minister David Cameron gave a 
reading during the service, where the congregation also included deputy president of the Republic of South Africa, Kgalema 
Motlanthe, and Archbishop Emeritus of Cape Town, the Most Reverend 
Desmond Tutu.

Mr Mandela's daughters Zenani Mandela-Dlamini and Zindzi Mandela were joined by politicians, celebrities and race campaigners for the service, where Prince Harry represented the Queen.

Stars who attended included actors Richard E Grant, Joanna Lumley and Idris Elba, who played the former president in the biopic Mandela: Long Walk To Freedom.Â 

In an address to the congregation, the Most Rev Tutu, the former Archbishop of Cape Town thanked "splendid" and "amazing" anti-apartheid campaigners for their efforts in changing the "moral climate" over apartheid.

"What would have happened had Mandela died in prison as was the intention and hope of the upholders of apartheid," he said. "I suppose most would have regarded him as no better than a terrorist - after all, persons in high positions in Britain and the US did dismiss him as such."

Singling out the anti-apartheid movement for praise, he thanked those who had picketed South Africa House, the South African High Commission in London.

"Thank you, you who regularly picketed South Africa House, thank you elegant ladies who boycotted South African goods, thank you to all those who followed the long haired Peter Hain to stop South African sports, thank you all those incredible young people in other parts of the world," he said.

Today Dr John Hall, Dean of Westminster the Very Reverend, announced a ledger stone will be placed in the abbey later 
this year.

Dr Hall said: 'Nelson 
Mandela was one of the most remarkable world leaders of the last 
century. His remarkable constancy under suffering stand as an example to
 everyone.

'In addition, his capacity for forgiveness and his generosity of spirit show what humanity at its best can achieve.

'His
 memorial in Westminster Abbey, justified in itself, standing amongst 
memorials to many of the greatest men and women of the world, not all of
 them British, will also prove to be a focus of contemplation and prayer
 for the gift of forgiveness and reconciliation in many communities and 
places in our troubled world.'

Others at the service included actor Richard E Grant (left) and race campaigner Baroness Lawrence

Mr Cameron's 
reading was from John 10:10-16, which includes the lines: 'I am the good 
shepherd, and know my sheep, and am known of mine. As the Father knoweth
 me, even so know I the Father: and I lay down my life for the sheep.'

When Mr Mandela died in December, Mr Cameron said: 'A great light has gone out in the world. Nelson Mandela was a hero of our time.'

The Most Rev Tutu, the former 
Archbishop of Cape Town thanked 'splendid' and 'amazing' anti-apartheid 
campaigners for their efforts in changing the 'moral climate' over 
apartheid.

He told the 
congregation: 'What would have happened had Mandela died in prison as 
was the intention and hope of the upholders of apartheid.

'I
 suppose most would have regarded him as no better than a terrorist - 
after all, persons in high positions in Britain and the US did dismiss 
him as such.'

Mr Mandela, a former lawyer, spent 27 years in 
apartheid prisons for his political beliefs before becoming South 
Africa's first black president.

His
 critical role in both achieving full democracy in South Africa and then
 keeping the peace when it arrived in 1994 earned him a Nobel Peace 
Prize.

Mr Hain, a former Northern Ireland 
secretary, told the congregation that Mr Mandela never forgot his 
connection with Britain - which he 'revered' - even during his harshest 
years in jail on Robben Island.

While
 behind bars the apartheid regime was at its most ruthless, Mr Hain 
said, and there was a majority in the House of Commons against him and 
the African National Congress.

Nevertheless, 'tens of thousands' of British citizens had supported Mr Mandela's fight for freedom, Mr Hain added.

He
 said campaigns such as those for the abolition of slavery, for the 
women's vote and the anti-apartheid movement were 'invariably unpopular 
at the time they most need support only to be glorified, indeed 
sanctified once they have triumphed,' he said.

Mr Hain spoke of the 'great privilege' of having known Mr Mandela and his 'impish and mischievous' sense of humour.

He said Mr Mandela had been unable to attend Mr Hain's second wedding in 2003 but had joked: 'Perhaps I can come next time?'
