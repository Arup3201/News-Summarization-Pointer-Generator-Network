It's probably the ultimate property for a wealthy London commuter - and it comes with the ultimate car thrown in for free.

This six-bedroom home in a private cul-de-sac in north London is being sold complete with the 195mph Bentley Continental GTC sports car that is parked in the driveway.

Current owner Graham Goodkind, 47, is offering the vehicle as a sweetener to anyone prepared to meet the near £1.9million asking price for his immaculately-decorated 1930s-style detached home.

Aptly, given the free car on offer, 
the home is called The Bentley and backs on to the Bentley Priory Nature
reserve in north London.

The property has an outdoor heated swimming pool, a sound-proofed cinema room and a large back garden.

And if that isn't enough for you, the car's specifications are equally impressive.

With a 6-litre V12 engine, the Bentley Continental GTC - which is worth around £85,000 - will do 0-62mph in 5.1 seconds.

The vehicle, which is a Mulliner Park Ward special edition, comes with just 19,500 miles on the clock and a full service history.

Mr Goodkind has lived in the property with his wife Lisa and two children for the last eight years but said he is now looking to move a bit further out of London.

'The reason for the offer is it is a 
lovely house but selling a property is a competitive business - there 
are lots of very nice houses for sale all the time and I am in the 
marketing business so thought this was a good idea,' he said.

'Usually you put your property in the local paper and have a board outside but that is it.'

Mr Goodkind said he has owned the car for around three years.

'The car is a Bentley and the house 
is called The Bentley so it all fits nicely,' he added. 'I better avoid 
moving to a Skoda Avenue next.'

He said that the property has been on the market since last Friday and it has already attracted a lot of interest.

The nearby Bentley Priory is the base where the army planned their victory in the Battle of Britain.

Winston Churchill, William Pitt, 
Queen Victoria and General Eisenhower are among the illustrious list of 
names from the past who have visited the 18th century property over the 
years.

With such a famous property nearby, 
there are expected to be no shortage of takers for the six-bedroom home 
which comes with a free Bentley.

Lisa Goodkind, the property vendor at
Preston Bennett estate agents, said: ‘There are lots of properties 
advertised all the time and we decided that we wanted do something a bit
more original that just an ad in the paper or a "for sale" sign 
outside.'

Exclusive: The sound-proofed cinema room complete with chairs which have room for drink bottles

Back garden: The large garden in the London property which has a large outdoor swimming pool

She added: ‘Offering a Bentley for free with “The Bentley”, in Bentley Way made sense.

'It will certainly be the first time 
that people get to combine looking round a beautiful house with going 
for a spin in a prestige car.’

Lee Martin, a director at estate agents Preston Bennett, who is arranging viewings of the property and the car, added: ‘We've sold thousands of homes over the years, but never with a car.

‘The Bentley is a fabulous house and the Bentley car is a beautiful vehicle. The two go perfectly together.’
