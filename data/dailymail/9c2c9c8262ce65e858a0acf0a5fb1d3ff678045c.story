The staggering extent to which high street bank staff chasing bonuses and commission are routinely ripping off customers was laid bare in a scathing report yesterday.

At the same time, the Daily Mail can reveal that 40 per cent of staff at Lloyds Banking Group earn extra payments if customers are persuaded to buy additional financial products.

They get bonuses if they can entice millions of loyal account holders to fork out for costly insurance policies or 'premium' current accounts which charge a monthly fee.

Probe: Lloyds Banking Group is facing further investigation and a possible penalty following an FSA investigation into 'dysfunctional' incentive schemes in the banking sector

Separately, in a report by the 
Financial  Services Authority regulator, published  yesterday, account 
holders were said to be viewed only as 'sales targets' exploited by  
'pile it high and sell it quick' tactics that verge on the criminal.

Banks were told to clean up their act or face a major clampdown.

The FSA's report into the incentive payments has brought another day of shame for Britain's financial industry.

It revealed that one firm has been 
referred to its Enforcement and Financial Crime Division. Sources named 
the bank as Lloyds, which is 41 per cent owned by the taxpayer.

Anrgy: FSA boss Martin Wheatley says: 'Financial institutions have changed their view of consumers from someone to serve to someone to sell to'

Ruthless salesmen were said to be so 
desperate to meet sales targets that they even sell to family members 
such as their elderly mothers or sisters.

Others were found guilty of colluding 
to 'intentionally overcharge' a customer to trigger a bonus payout. The 
report said that some firms pay a 'Super Bonus' of up to £10,000 to the 
first 21 workers who meet a sales target.

In other cases, staff are not paid a 
basic salary, which means their own financial survival depends on their 
ability to sell, a situation the report warned 'significantly' increased
the risk of mis-selling.

Yesterday Martin Wheatley, of the FSA,
said: 'Some time ago, financial institutions changed their view of 
consumers from people to serve, to people to sell to.'

He read the riot act to the industry –
which also includes insurers and investment firms – telling companies 
to 'clean up their act' or face a clampdown in the next 12 to 18 months.

Firms can continue to pay commission, but such payments must benefit the customer, not the salesmen.

'It has been too easy, for too long, 
for those selling or giving advice to be motivated solely by the rewards
on offer to them, rather than how to enrich their customer,' he said.

'We all know what it is like to walk 
into a bank to do something simple, like paying a credit card bill, only
for the person behind the counter to ask if you would like to extend 
your credit, take out more insurance or look at their competitive 
mortgage rates?'

He warned some of the mis-selling was 'very close to fraud, which is a criminal offence'.

Crackdown: FSA says cultural change is needed and chief executives at top banks are ultimately accountable for the way their staff are incentivised

The scale of the mis-selling is shocking in an industry which provides products essential to the lives of millions.

Of the 22 firms investigated by the 
FSA between September 2010 and September 2011, 20 were found to have 
'features in their incentive schemes that increased the risk of 
mis-selling'.

The report highlights one salesman 'blatantly misleading' a customer to scoop £1,000.

In another case, two salesmen 
'colluded to intentionally overcharge' a customer because the bonus was 
linked to the amount that the client had agreed to pay for the product.

Yesterday the Financial Services 
Consumer Panel criticised the FSA for being 'slow to respond' to a 
problem which has existed for decades.

Chairman Adam Phillips said: 'The 
regulator has made a commitment to change the industry's behaviour. We 
hope that this time the industry will get the message and not try to 
find a way to get around the rules as they have done in the past.'

Lloyds Banking Group said it had made 
significant changes to its incentive schemes this year, adding: 'Today 
these schemes reward staff for providing high quality customer service, 
assessed by a wide range of metrics.'

But it confirmed that around 40,000 of its 100,000 staff were eligible for incentive schemes.

On serving customers:'Why is it that every time I walk into the bank to do something simple, like pay my credit card bill, the person behind the counter asks me if I would like to extend my credit, take out more insurance or look at their competitive mortgage rates?

'When did this happen? Banks for me used to be a service – a place where you would go in, stand in a queue, have a pleasant chat with the clerk and go about your daily business. Some time ago, this changed – financial institutions have changed their view of consumers from someone to serve to someone to sell to.'  On why selling financial products is different from flogging fast food or TVs:'This is not like when you go to a fast food restaurant and the server asks ‘do you want fries with that?’, or ‘do you want to go large?’. We all know they ask these questions because they are encouraged to make the most of every sale, and when customers are standing at the counter, they are more likely to say yes. But then we also know what to expect – chiefly lots of salt, calories and a bigger waistline.

'But far fewer of us actually have such a clear understanding of financial services.  We also mostly trust those selling or giving advice to be acting in our best interests.

'These are often complex and long-term products that turn into long-term problems if they go wrong.

'The cost of going large may cost us a few pence – the cost of buying the wrong mortgage could see you lose your home.

'And while it is annoying that when you buy a TV they only seem interested in selling you the warranty, that is nothing compared to trying to find a safe home for your money, only for the person in the bank to only seem interested in selling you a confusing product that could put your life savings at risk.'On changing culture at the top:'Firms need to change how they incentivise their staff and learn to manage their risks. CEOs are ultimately accountable for the way their staff are incentivised, so we expect them to take a real interest in fixing this.  Recurring problems need to be investigated, action taken and redress paid to consumers who have lost out.

'I want to draw a line in the sand here.'
