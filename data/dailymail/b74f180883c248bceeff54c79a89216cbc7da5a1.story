British raiders The Grey Gatsby and Brown Panther were left floundering in the Longchamp mud on Sunday.

The Michael Owen-owned Brown Panther, fourth in the Ascot Gold Cup last month, emerged with the most credit in the Group Two Prix Maurice De Nieuil Stakes, finishing an honourable second to the impressive Terrubi.

However, The Grey Gatsby found the heavy Paris rain all against him in the Group One Grand Prix De Paris and  came home a disappointing sixth behind Coolmore’s  surprise 33-1 winner Gallante.

Meanwhile, Edward Lynam will bid to conquer Australia after witnessing his high-class sprinter Slade Power triumph in Saturday’s Darley July Cup at Newmarket.

The five-year-old’s Group One win ensured he has become the dominant force in the six furlong division and  Irish handler Lynam said: ‘I’m looking forward to taking him to Melbourne. The last race of his career will be in the VRC Sprint there in November.

‘I think he has proved himself the best sprinter in Europe and the obvious step now is to try and make him the best sprinter in the world. What better place to go than Australia and beat them on their own patch.’ 

Tony McCoy failed by a head to draw level with trainer Martin Pipe’s record  of 4,191 career winners when Retrieve was agonisingly denied at Southwell.

So close: Tony McCoy narrowly missed out on drawing level with Martin Pipe's record of 4,191 career winners

The champion jockey had earlier moved to within one of Pipe by partnering Stonemadforspeed to     a narrow win.

Retrieve looked sure to oblige for the 19-time champion when going clear two hurdles from home but he was overhauled in the dying stages.

McCoy will look to break the record with four rides on Monday at Newton Abbot.
