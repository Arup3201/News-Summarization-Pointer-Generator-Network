Parliament ended with the most tremendous, tetchy – tearful! – squabble: should Speaker Bercow's future be decided by secret ballot?

It became a day of wondrous hysteria, tantrums, moist hankies and (for the time being) survival for this stinker of a Speaker.

Labour MPs and a handful of men on the Weirdo Right insisted that a secret ballot would be 'undemocratic'.

Moderate Tories and Lib Dems argued that MPs openly voting against Bercow feared the Squeaker's tyrannical vengeance crashing about their ears.

Good grief, you mean an allegedly impartial Speaker might hold grudges? You mean this shouty, sarcastic, balled fist of a Speaker might nurse resentments and use his privileged position to queer the Commons?

Labour and its Cameron-haters on the Right – unhappy creatures such as Edward Leigh and David Davis – narrowly won the day. 

By the end, Bercow was blubbing with relief, while his friend (and possible successor) Charles Walker was wailing that some beastly, beastly men had not been entirely clear with him beforehand. Boo hoo!

Mr Walker is so widely seen as a Bercow stooge, it may not be surprising that he was kept out of the loop by Bercow's enemies.

His chin-crumpling speech, in which he said he preferred to be thought an honest fool than a clever schemer, was greeted with frenetic clapping from Labour.

It was soon being compared to the Gettysburg Address, Churchill's 'fight them on the beaches' speech, the Sermon on the Mount. Labour MPs and Bercow's Tory nutjobs waved their Order Papers and accused Commons Leader William Hague of being a Soviet Union dictator.

Bercowites leapt in the air, brandishing their pleasure and accusing the secret ballot crowd of being 'grubby' and 'partisan'.

Bercow supporters had been taken by surprise on Wednesday evening by a cunning ploy from Westminster's very own Baldrick, Government Chief Whip Michael Gove. A secret ballot may have looked harmless. We all have one in the coming general election.

But Labour – which regards Bercow as a client Speaker – saw that a secret ballot would give its own MPs the cloak of anonymity.

That would make them impossible to Whip. Labour MPs were therefore hauled back from the furthest ends of the kingdom to save the Speaker for socialism.

At this point you will say 'well, naturally Bercow must have let one of his deputies chair the debate, as it would have been improper for him to supervise it himself'. You do not know this man. Of course he chaired it! And he did so in the most hilariously biased fashion, calling a succession of his mates.

Labour delayed the debate, thus allowing its troops to get back from their constituencies. How did they do this? By asking the Speaker to give them Urgent Questions. Three, to be precise. He granted them all. Each of these devices use up precious time and made Bercow's survival more likely. A Tory moderate, Greg Barker (Bexhill & Battle), muttered 'oh, rubbish' while one of Mr Bercow's supporters was speaking.

A smiling Bercow snarled at Mr Barker that 'it is better to remain silent and look a fool than to remove any doubt'. This was an authentic Bercow moment – that combination of sneer and fake amusement catching his character perfectly.

Sir Gerald Kaufman (Lab, Gorton), in a Prince of Wales-check suit that will have made TV screens wobble, made a pro-Bercow speech of such acidity, it must have corroded the pinky gums at the bottom of his ancient, yellowing fangs.

Sir Gerald is likely to be the next Father of the House and will therefore be in charge of the House when it has a chance to approve Bercow's continued existence in the Chair. How convenient! Was yesterday's plot driven by partisanship? It was certainly driven by hatred of Bercow, who was elected in 2009 amid sly partisanship by Labour.

The once great Chair of our elected Legislature has never looked so tawdry. The Tories should run a candidate against Bercow in Buckingham. Jeremy Clarkson?
