Steven Gerrard is in good spirits as he continued his rehabilitation, following a hamstring injury he suffered in his last Premier League match.

The Liverpool captain tweaked his hamstring against Tottenham and is set to be out for two weeks. 

Club physio, Chris Morgan, was with Gerrard as he posted a picture of himself on the treatment table, showing he is on the road to recovery.

Gerrard is hoping to be available for his side’s match with Manchester City on March 1, but won’t feature against Crystal Palace in the FA Cup this weekend.

He is due to leave Liverpool in the summer and has signed a deal to join MLS club LA Galaxy.
