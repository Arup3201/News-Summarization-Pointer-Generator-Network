A man who installed CCTV at his best mate's pawnbrokers shop has been sentenced to 12 months in prison after he was caught stealing from the shop - by the same cameras.

Robert James Wroe, 39, was sentenced in Maryborough Magistrates Court in Queensland on Monday for breaking into Loans Star Trading Post and stealing $6,300 worth of cash and jewellery on November 17 last year.

Wroe installed seven security cameras at the store six years ago for his friend Wayne McKellar, meaning he had the ability to turn them off remotely using his phone.

Robert Wroe was caught stealing from his mate's pawnbrokers shop on CCTV cameras he installed himself

Last November, while Mr McKellar and his wife Narelle were on holiday in Bali, Wroe turned off the camera that covered the main section of the store and broke into the shop.

He opened the front door using the keypad he had installed and then stole $6,300 in cash and jewellery, thinking he was out of view of the security system.

He then left the store and put a business card on the screen door, to make it appear on the cameras that were still functioning that he had just arrived at the store, found it locked and decided to leave a business card.

Other cameras which didn't cover the main area of the shop were left.

When Mr and Mrs McKellar returned to Australia, Mrs McKellar combed through footage in an effort to solve the case.

'My wife went through the cameras for days and days, and bang, she saw something,' Mr McKellar told MailOnline.

One of the cameras showed a side door opening minutes before Wroe was captured leaving his business card at the front door.

In another shot, Mrs McKellar saw a guitar stand move which was placed near where the jewellery and cash was kept.

Robert Wroe turned off some of the cameras inside the store and pretended he was just there to drop off a business card, all while holding $6,300 worth of stolen goods behind his back

Police arrested Wroe after Mr McKellar spotted a blue plastic container from the store on the front seat of Wroe's car.

'The worst thing about it, he's been a great friend and we've been great mates for years, we socialise together, we've done things together,' Mr McKellar said.

'He had a little girl recently and he named his daughter Narelle after my wife. If he had a boy he was going to call it Wayne after me.

'That's what really hurts me more, how such a good friend could do that to you.

Wroe has been ordered to pay $6,300 in compensation and will be remanded in jail until November this year.

'I'm going back to the old-fashioned lock and key,' Mr McKeller said.
