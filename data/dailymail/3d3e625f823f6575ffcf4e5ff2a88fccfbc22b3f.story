They have long been a favourite among A-list celebrities.

But it seems Mulberry handbags also have a fan in Cheryl Prudham – a pregnant mother of 11 who receives more than £39,000 a year in benefits.

She was seen taking her brood to one of the store’s branches, where she splurged on the brand’s luxury products. 

In the bag: Cheryl Prudham with her purchase after emerging from the Mulberry store at Westfield Shopping Centre in East London

The family pose for a picture outside the store. Mrs Prudham is a pregnant mother of 11 and receives £39,000 a year in benefits 

Her husband Rob, 29, pointed out an £850 red shoulder bag in the window display, before they entered the outlet at Westfield shopping centre in Stratford, East London, last week.

After browsing the designer wares, they left with a small grey Mulberry carrier bag.

It is not known exactly what Mrs Prudham, 32, purchased but a purse costs £275, a wallet £295 and the classic Mulberry Bayswater handbag £895.

And it is certainly not the first time the Prudhams, from Gravesend in Kent, have been spotted enjoying an indulgent lifestyle.

The family get £39,192 in handouts a year on top of Mr Prudham’s monthly salary of £1,600 as a delivery driver – taking their annual income to nearly £60,000

Last year the family attracted attention for taking a £7,000 holiday in Menorca, with Mrs Prudham telling Closer magazine: ‘I don’t feel bad about using taxpayers’ money. We’re entitled to a holiday.’

And just last month, it was revealed the couple had reunited after a brief split so they can have more babies.

‘I get more in benefits with every child I have, so I can afford a big family,’ said Mrs Prudham, whose 12th child is due in July.

The family get £39,192 in handouts a year on top of Mr Prudham’s monthly salary of £1,600 as a delivery driver – taking their annual income to nearly £60,000.

They have managed to avoid the Government’s £26,000-a-year benefits cap because Mr Prudham works enough hours to claim working tax credit. 

Mr and Mrs Prudham have been together for six years, and Mr Prudham is the father of his wife's youngest children and they live in a five-bedroom council house

They live in a five-bedroom council house – but are on the waiting list for a seven-bedroom home because their current accommodation is ‘too cramped’.

The couple have been together six years, and Mr Prudham is the father of his wife’s five youngest children. 

They broke up when she discovered he had been sending indecent messages to a woman on Facebook – but got back together after he apologised.

They now plan to renew their wedding vows later this year.
