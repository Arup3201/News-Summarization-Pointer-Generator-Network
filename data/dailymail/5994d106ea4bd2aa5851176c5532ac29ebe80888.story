A woman who  glued her two-year-old daughter's hands
to a wall and beat the toddler so badly that she suffered significant 
brain trauma has pleaded for leniency, saying she was no longer the "monster" who committed the attack.

Elizabeth Escalona, who pleaded guilty in July to felony injury to a child, told a judge: 'I will never forgive myself for what I did to my own daughter.'

"I want everybody to know I'm not a monster," Escalona said. "I love my kids."

Police say Escalona lost her temper last year with Jocelyn Cedillo over potty training problems. Escalona beat and kicked Jocelyn before sticking her hands to an apartment wall using an adhesive commonly known as Super Glue. The child was hospitalized for days.

A counselor earlier claimed that a woman who  glued her two-year-old daughter's hands
to a wall and beat the toddler so badly that she suffered significant 
brain trauma loves her children.

Melanie Davis testified on Wednesday in the case of Elizabeth Escalona, a 23-year-old mother of five from Dallas who admitted to the attack in July. Prosecutors are now seeking a 45-year jail sentence.

But Davis said she has been counseling the mother, who beat her daughter Jocelyn after losing her temper over potty training, since June and believes that she loves all of her children.

Awaiting her fate: Elizabeth Escalona, 23, sits in a Dallas courtroom to be sentenced. On Wednesday, her sister pleaded with the judge to be lenient, while a counselor said Escalona loves her children

She said that Escalona is determined to find a job and eventually get her children, who are living with their grandmother, back to her own home.

The testimony came as Escalona's sister also pleaded with the judge to be lenient in his sentencing, even though she acknowledged her own outrage following the grisly attack.

Margaret Escalona said she wanted to beat up her sister after the attack, and described seeing Jocelyn 
struggling for her life. But she says her sister 'needs help' rather than a lengthy sentence.

It also follows testimony on Monday from Escalona's mother who said her daughter was 'not a monster' and that she deserves probation, insisting her daughter could be 'fixed'.

On Monday, a doctor, Dr
Amy Barton, also revealed the extent of the horrifying injuries to the young girl, who has since recovered.

The girl was rushed to hospital after 
Escalona called her mother and said there was something wrong with her 
daughter. When the child's grandmother got to the house, the girl was 
unresponsive.

Dr
Barton showed photos of the beaten 
child in court showing her bruises, cuts and bite 
marks all over her body shortly after she was brought to Children’s 
Medical Center in Dallas.

Some of her hair had been pulled out and there was glue in her eyelashes and on her hands. Glue and
paint were stuck to her palms, with skin torn away in places, the police report noted.

The toddler was in a coma for two days after the September 7, 2011, incident.

Sentence: Prosecutors are seeking a 45-year jail sentence against the mother of five from Dallas

Police
records show the toddler's siblings told investigators their mother 
repeatedly kicked the girl in the stomach, hit her with a milk jug and then beat her with a shoe and belt.

Escalona then dragged her daughter by her feet before gluing her hands to the wall until they bled.

Dr
Barton, a child abuse pediatrician who worked at the hospital at 
the time, cried when she testified about the injuries, according to the Dallas Morning News.

'The entire picture was very shocking,' she said. 'I see a lot of children and this was one of the most shocking things that I've seen.'

The section of the wall the toddler's hands were glued to was cut out and presented to the court.

Shock: On Monday, a doctor showed photos of the beaten child in 
which she had bruises, cuts and bite marks all over her body shortly 
after she was brought to Children's Medical Center in Dallas, pictured

Escalona, who stayed silent in court, previously said of the case: 'I have no comment, and only God can judge me. That’s all I gotta say.'

Police said that numerous people had seen the suspect inflict pain on her daughter in the past.

On
the day of the attack Escalona changed her Facebook profile photo to 
one of her and Jocelyn and wrote: 'Why does God put obstacles in my 
life?'

The girl has recovered from her injuries. She and her siblings were taken into state custody after their mother’s arrest and now live with their grandmother.
