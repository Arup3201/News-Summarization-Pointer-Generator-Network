California may be known for it's Mexican food but the 'world's first' burrito vending machine that opened this month in Los Angeles may just take fast food on the West Coast to the next level.

'Burritobox' is a 24-hour meal machine operating outside of a Mobil gas station in Santa Monica Boulevard that not only serves a variety of burritos but even plays a music video while the product heats up.

Patrons can use their credit card to purchase the $3 dish. Another location will open up at an Santa Monica 76 station in Century City at midnight on January 18.

The vending machine is made by Box Brands Inc. and the company boasts that the machine can steam pre-made burritos in just one minute.

The choices include breakfast, lunch, and dinner burritos. Breakfast is chorizo sausage, egg, and cheese, lunch is shredded beef and cheese, and dinner could be free range chicken with rice, beans, and uncured bacon. Patrons can also order a vegetarian option of roasted potato, egg, and cheese.There are no customization options but people can choose sides like guacamole, sour cream, and hot sauce. Even though the burritos qualify as fast food, the company claims that the burritos are 100 per cent natural without hormones or antibiotics, reports ABC news.

'Yes we really exist! & Yes we serve breakfast 24/7! Cage-free eggs in all our breakfast burritos!' said the company on their twitter.

'DONT FORGET YOUR SIDES!! SO MANY OF YOU HAVE BEEN FORGETTING YOUR ADD ONS!! Someone hit the jackpot and got 4 sour creams today!! Lucky her! ' said Burritobox on twitter.

Customers are flocking to the vending machines inside the 24-hour Mobil station in Santa Monica

Food vending machines have become quite the trend in Los Angeles and patrons can purchase juice, cupcakes, and even caviar from machines, reports Eater.

The world's first 'burrito kiosk' seems to be attracting a lot of positive attention on social media sites such as facebook, twitter, and instagram.

'I just found out that @BurritoBox is a thing. Mind. Blown,' said twitter user Luke Wahl.

'It was quick, it’s tasty, it’s cheap' 
patron Billy Hamilton told ABC Los Angeles affiliate KABC. '“I’ll be 
back,' Hamilton added.

Fans are invited to post pictures and videos of themselves on the company's instagram doing the 'burrito dance' as the music video plays and their burrito cooks.

Some love the new vending machine, but not everyone.

One reporter from Vice Magazine tried the food and said, ' I begrudgingly finished my burrito, which was not even Taco Bell quality.  And the inside of my burrito looked like the remains of a hamster that 
got run over by a taxicab. Honestly, this thing was no different than 
getting a frozen burrito at the gas station and microwaving it, like in 
the old days.'

Wther you like them or not, burritos will be free on January 18. for the opening of their second location in Santa Monica.
