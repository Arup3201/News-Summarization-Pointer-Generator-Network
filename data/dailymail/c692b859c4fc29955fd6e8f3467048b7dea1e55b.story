Bali Nine inmate Myuran Sukumaran’s art work has taken a visibly dark turn as his execution looms in Indonesia.

A far cry from the colour-filled portraits and still lifes he created while teaching art to inmates at Kerobokan jail, the art work produced by Mr Sukumaran in the last two months is mournful and often chilling.

A wooden execution stake still covered in the blood of prisoners who were shot last.

Another is a self portrait, smeared to the point you can no longer recognise Myuran looking back at you.

And a portrait of the only man who has the power to save his life.

His portrait of Indonesian President Joko Widodo, along with other works he completed after the rejection of his clemency plea, will be displayed at an exhibition for prisoner art in Bali on Friday.

There are another 93 painting were produced inside the Balinese jail by  prisoners who participated in Mr Sukumaran's art program which will be auctioned off at the the Hard Rock Hotel in Kuta.

But Mr Sukumaran's artworks are not for sale. They could possibly be the last link his family have to the condemned man.

Mr Sukumaran has not been allowed to paint since he was transferred to ‘Death Island’ last Thursday.

Workers from inside the prison said Mr Sukumaran was integral in turning around the lives of countless Indonesian prisoners by nurturing their creative side in art classes provided by the jail.

Mr Sukamaran was awarded an Associate Degree in Fine Art from Curtin University in Perth after completing the degree from inside the walls of the Balinese prison. 

Myuran Sukumaran was commended by the art community for obtaining his degree while imprisoned

The money raised by auctioning off prisoners artwork at the exhibition will be used to continue funding the art program at the Kerobokan prison as well as building a gallery intended to showcase the works of ex-prisoners who were mentored by Mr Sukumaran.

Several prisoners who have contributed to the showcase are expected to attend the event under the supervision of prison guards.

A number of Mr Sukumaran's paintings will also be showcased in the Netherlands in an exhibition organised by Danish woman, Tania Albers. 

Ms Albers established a friendship with Mr Sukumaran after first visiting the jail in 2006. 

The art exhibition, which will also visit London, features Mr Sukumaran's darker works including the bullet painting,  self portraits and works of his family.

Mr Sukumaran painted his friend Tania who is responsible for the art exhibiton in the Netherlands on March 20.

The art exhibit comes as the legal appeals of Mr Sukumaran and his partner Mr Chan were adjourned until next week after the Indonesian president's representation did not bring required documentation to trial.  

Presiding judge Ujang Abdullah said the appeal could not be heard as the president's representative in court did not have a signed letter of power of attorney.

The Administrative Court rejected their earlier challenge on the grounds the court had no authority over presidential decisions.

The case has been adjourned  until March 19.

The Australian government has not given up its efforts to spare the lives of the Australian prisoners with Foreign Minister Julie Bishop offering to cover the cost of life imprisonment for Mr Sukumaran and Mr Chan if Indonesia agrees to call of their executions.
