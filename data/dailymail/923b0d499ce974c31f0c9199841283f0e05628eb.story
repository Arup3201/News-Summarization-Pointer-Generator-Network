Demand from wealthy overseas buyers for multi-million pound London homes is fuelling a property bubble in the capital, experts say.

High-end property prices are soaring as London becomes ever more attractive to foreign investors seeking a 'safe haven' for their cash, amid economic and political instability in many other parts of the world.

Meanwhile new figures reveal a boom in the buy-to-let market, with lending to landlords topping £5billion.

Booming market: The number of buy-to-let mortgage lenders has surged to levels not seen since 2008

Some 40,000 buy-to-let mortgages were advanced in the three months until the end of June, worth £5.1bn in total.  

Demand for buy-to-let properties has also seen house prices driven up further in the capital, where one expert described an £850,000 house in Battersea that would give a gross rental yield of just 3.6 per cent before any costs to the landlord.

'That just cannot carry on,' buying agent Henry Pryor told the Guardian, adding that the capital was 'in a bubble'.

But Mr Pryor said that, with London now on the radar of wealthy Brazilians, the bubble would 'grow before it pops'.

The 40,000 buy-to-let mortgages advanced in the three months to the end of June marked an increase of just under a 
fifth from the first three months of the year, according to figures from
the Council of Mortgage Lenders (CML).

It included a 24 per cent rise in remortgaging as landlords took advantage of cheaper deals on offer from banks and building societies.

It means the buy-to-let market is now at its most buoyant since the third quarter of 2008, when the collapse of US investment bank Lehman Brothers sent global markets into freefall.

But it remains much lower than at the peak of the housing market boom in the summer of 2007 when £12.7bn was lent in just three months. 

Jackie Bennett, head of policy at the CML, said the recent surge had been driven by strong demand from renters as well as low interest rates.

She said: ‘These conditions are creating more opportunities for landlords to remortgage, as well as helping to fund increased activity in the mortgage market more generally.’

But last night campaigners said the figures highlighted the widening gulf between the fortunes of borrowers and savers.  

Dr Ros Altmann, a former government adviser and savings expert, said: ‘This is great news for borrowers. 

‘Those who have got plenty of money and can afford a second property are able to borrow at record low rates. 

‘But people who have done the right thing and saved for the future are being wiped out.’

Meanwhile the number of properties in London's most desirable postcodes being snapped up by foreign buyers has sparked fears UK buyers are being priced out of the market.

Buying agent Mr Pryor said the property market in the capital had 'lost touch with reality', pointing to soaring profits at upmarket estate agency Savills for evidence of 'everything you need to know about the housing market'.

Thanks to booming sales in Kensington and Mayfair Savills average sale price has risen 18 per cent to £3.2million.

Macroeconomic and financial consultancy Fathom Consulting identifies the most monied areas of the capital - including Kensington and Chelsea, Mayfair, Notting Hill and Belgravia - as Prime Central London.

It said more than half of PCL properties that sold for upwards of £2million in the 12 months to March this year went to overseas buyers.

When it comes to the most expensive of properties the trend is even more pronounced - the proportion of £5million plus properties bought with foreign cash is closer to 60 per cent, the report said.

According to Fathom, the prime London market is currently more overvalued than any time since 1995 at the latest.

Prime Central London: The rise in house prices across the country is most pronounced in exclusive areas of the capital

Peter Young, the Kensington-based 
managing director of estate agent John D Wood & Co, told the 
Guardian the boom in international buyers meant London was effectively becoming a 
'land bank'.

From Chelsea to Notting Hill, house prices in London's most desirable postcodes are soaring.

And a Fathom Consulting report reveals that, when it comes to multi-million pound properties, overseas buyers account for more than half of all sales.

But what is it that makes international buyers so keen to spend their money in London?

According to Fathom, there are three main factors contributing to the popularity of the capital's most exclusive areas.

First, the weakness of the pound means beneficial exchange rates can boost foreign buyers' spending power.

Second, the performance of global equity markets, and third, the perception of London as a 'safe haven' in which to invest money - immune from the troubles of the euro.

He said: 'Would you put your money into the euro or sterling if you were a Russian?

'Do you trust Spain, France of Portugal for laws on property, tax, the government and economic stability more than Britain?'

But Savils chief executive Jeremy Helsby said it was inaccurate to suggest UK buyers were being priced out of the market by overseas investors.

'They are still the majority buyers of secondhand properties and that trend is increasing,' he said.

Nonetheless prices continue to rise, with Chesterton Humberts forecasting prime London properties to go up by 8 per cent a year between now and 2018.

Sales director Debra Stroud said the estate agency was busier now than even 2007 - before the financial crash.

While the rest of the country has not quite reached the heady heights of the London property market, house prices are rising thanks to the drop in mortgage rates since the Government introduced its Funding For
Lending Scheme to breathe life into the economy last summer. 

But the stimulus plan has caused misery for savers as banks have also rushed to cut interest rates on deposit accounts. 

The
bottomless pit of cheap money from the Bank of England means they no 
longer need to attract savers’ cash by paying competitive returns. 

On
Wednesday the Bank of England said that rates could stay at a record 
low of 0.5pc for another three years, as it unveiled its new ‘forward 
guidance’ policy.

Figures released today from estate 
agency group LSL Property Services show that house prices in England and
Wales have reached their highest ever level - higher than the 2007 
peak.

An average house now costs £232,969 - an increase of more than £500 a month in the past year.

According to Savills, which sells high-end property, the average price of its London portfolio is £3.2m.

Halifax also confirmed that house prices have been increasing at their fastest rate in three years.

Stephen
Lewis, chief economist at Monument Securities, told The Guardian: 'The 
danger is that, when a flood tide of mortgage finance meets a chronic 
shortage of housing, the result will be an escalation of house prices.'
