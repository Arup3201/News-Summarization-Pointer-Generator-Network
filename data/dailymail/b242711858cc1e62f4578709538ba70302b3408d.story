An eight-year-old girl was fighting for her life today after being shot when a gun brought into her school inside a classmate's backpack discharged.

Washington youngster Amina Kocer-Bowman was in a critical condition in hospital after having surgery on a bullet wound in her stomach, authorities said.

A fellow third-grade boy is being held at Kitsap County juvenile detention centre on suspicion of unlawful possession of a gun, bringing a dangerous weapon to school and third-degree assault.

Victim: Amina Kocer-Bowman was accidentally shot in the abdomen when the gun that was inside another student's backpack went off and hit her

Critical: Amina's mother was already on her way to pick her daughter up from school when she learned of the shooting, and shortly after that the 8-year-old girl was airlifted to a Seattle Hospital where she had surgery

Detectives believe the incdent at Armin Jahr Elementary in Bremerton, near Seattle, was accidental and are trying to establish how the boy got the gun.

The Bremerton Schools superintendent's office said the girl was shot in the abdomen.

KING-TV reported that her friends and relatives gave a 'thumbs up' signal to reporters as they left the Harborview Medical Center late yesterday.

Lori Morsette, a friend of victim's family, said: 'She is a sweet little girl and I don't know what to do. I'm trying to be supportive for my friends, I'm trying to be there for them.'

Horror: Kiomi Pavlock, 12, hugs her dad James as a friend shows her anguish over the incident. The school went into lockdown yesterday, but is expected to re-open today

Distraught: Savannah Anderson, 13, hugs her little sister Kaylee, 10, after arriving in the school's gymnasium to take her home following the shooting yesterday

The school is in a quiet residential neighborhood about 20 miles west of Seattle, across Puget Sound.

Fisher said officers and emergency crews were dispatched to the school around 1.30pm yesterday in response to a call that a student was shot by another pupil.

The school went into lockdown immediately after the shooting, said Bremerton Schools spokeswoman Patty Glaser.

Such procedures call for announcements to be made over the school's loudspeakers and for teachers to lock their classrooms, she said.

Parents picked up their children later in the afternoon.

Probe: The third-grade boy who allegedly brought the gun into school is being held at a juvenile detention centre on suspicion of illegally possessing a firearm and third-degree assault

Worried: A police officer offers reassurances to a pupil as the investigation into the shooting continues

Emergency: A police officer stands watch by the entrance to Armin Jahr Elementary School in Washington, where eight-year-old Amina Kocer-Bowman was shot when a gun discharged inside a boy's backpack

Armin Jahr Elementary has about 400 students, Glaser said. She said the school would reopen today and three counsellors would be available to talk to teachers, students and parents.

'Our plans at this time, school will continue as usual,' Glaser said.

Many questions remained. Police did not immediately describe the gun involved.

In the latest scorecard by the Brady Campaign, a national gun control advocacy group, Washington scored no points in the child safety category because the state does not require trigger locks for guns and lacks laws to prevent child access to firearms.

'Washington state is a loosely regulated state when it comes to firearms,' said Gregory Roberts, executive director of Washington Cease Fire, a Brady Campaign affiliate.

Amanda Roth, a staff attorney for the San Francisco-based Legal Community Against Violence, said 27 states and the District of Columbia have some form of firearm child access prevention laws.

Such laws can include requirements to use gun locks and criminal penalties for adults who allow children to get their hands on guns.
