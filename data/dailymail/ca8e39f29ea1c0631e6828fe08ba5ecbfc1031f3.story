Former Arsenal frontman Gervinho has claimed manager Arsene Wenger showed no faith in him during two seasons with the Gunners.

The Ivory Coast international flopped at the Emirates but has thrived since moving to Roma last summer.

The 27-year-old believes his current employers have shown confidence in him, allowing him to show his full capabilities, something which he claims was not the case at Arsenal.

Speaking ahead of Roma's Champions League clash with Manchester City on Tuesday, Gervinho said: 'I feel like a new player in Italy. It is very hard to have confidence in yourself when the coach does not have confidence in you - and it's clear at Arsenal that confidence was not shown in me. 

'At Roma the coach and the staff showed confidence in me from the first day - and because of that I have been able to show exactly what I am capable of.

‘I don't feel like I have anything to prove in England. I think the proof of what I can do is shown by a coach that has confidence in me. 

'Maybe Arsenal now think they should have shown more confidence in me - but that is not my problem. All my concentration is on a successful season with Roma.’

Having helped Roma to a second-placed finish in Serie A last season, Gervinho is confident the Italians can progress from a Champions League group which includes Premier League champions Manchester City and Bundesliga title winners Bayern Munich.

'I can't think of any good reason why we should be scared of Manchester City - I don't see why we should fear Bayern Munich either,' said Gervinho. 'The way we are playing this season - there is no reason to think we can't beat anybody. The only team that we need to concentrate or think about is ourselves.

After beating CSKA Moscow 5-1 in their Group E opener, Gervinho revealed Roma will be looking to beat City and will not go to the Etihad looking for a draw.

‘It was important in such a difficult group that we won our opening game - but we will not be looking for just a point at Manchester City. 

'The pressure is on them after losing their opening game - and we hope to take full advantage of that pressure - and leave Manchester with 3 points - which will put us in a great position to qualify.'

‘We want to win this group. We understand with the quality in the group that it will not be easy to win - but with the form that we are on anything is possible. Not just to win the group - but also to win The Champions League. 

'There is a lot of belief in this team at the moment - and we feel it is something we can achieve.'
