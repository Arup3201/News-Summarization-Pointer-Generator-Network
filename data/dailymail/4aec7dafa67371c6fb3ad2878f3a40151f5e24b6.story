British tourists are being tricked into spending hundreds of
pounds on emergency medical care in Spain that they should get for free, it has
been claimed.

Public hospitals are reportedly rejecting European Health
Insurance Cards and charging for treatment instead.

Under the card scheme, Europeans should be treated on the
same terms as citizens of the country they are visiting.

Any resident in an EU member country is entitled to get free state health care in a fellow member country by taking out an EHIC

In the case of Britons, the hospital bill would be picked up
by the NHS at a later stage.

However, visitors to Spain, where healthcare is free, are
being told to pay up front and reclaim the cost via their travel insurance.

It means those who have an EHIC, but have not taken out
travel insurance, potentially face bills worth thousands of pounds.

Julia Manning, spokeswoman for think tank
2020health, said earlier in the month: ‘We have heard many reports of holidaymakers being 
told they must pay for treatment in Spain — despite having an EHIC card.

The European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) is meant to guarantee free or reduced healthcare in Europe

‘These people are unwitting victims of the financial crisis and our Government should be warning about the dangers before we head abroad. We are in a situation when holidaymakers will have to check with their insurer before they leave home and say: “Will you cover me no matter what?” ’

Almost 11 million British tourists visit Spain each year.

 The country is facing huge cuts to its public services, which have left state hospitals running on a shoestring.

Any resident in an EU member country — plus Switzerland, Norway and Iceland — is entitled to get free state health care in a fellow member country by taking out an EHIC.

British travellers are not entitled to the same free treatments as the NHS would offer over here, but what local residents would get in their country.

Travel insurance is supposed to cover any shortfalls. However, over the last year the European Commission has received dozens of complaints from holidaymakers who have been denied treatment while abroad.

Trade body the Association of British Insurers is investigating 120 cases of holidaymakers being turned down by Spanish doctors.

Typically in these cases, sick tourists who need emergency treatment are being taken to the nearest clinic and hospital. On arrival they are asked whether they have travel insurance and the EHIC is generally ignored.

In the worst instances, those who don’t are told they have to pay for treatment on the spot. If they can’t pay, they are sent to a different hospital.

Official figures published three weeks ago revealed how Britain spent £247 million treating Spanish citizens last year.

However, Spain spent just £3.2 million treating British people.

A spokesman for the European Commission says: ‘We have been  receiving an increasing number of complaints about the European health insurance card being refused in Spain by certain public hospitals.

‘Many of these hospitals provide public and private healthcare and some tourists say they have been pushed to accept private treatment and use their travel insurance.’

The European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) replaced the old E111 in 2006.

The NHS warns that the EHIC is not an alternative to travel insurance and does not cover any private medical healthcare or costs such as mountain rescue in ski resorts, being flown back to the UK, or lost or stolen property.

It is meant to cover carriers of the card for treatment that is needed to allow them to continue their stay.
