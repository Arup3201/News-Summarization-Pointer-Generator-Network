A lifelong vegetarian told she would never have children has given birth to triplets after she started eating meat.

Laura Dixon, 34, turned to IVF after trying for ten years to  get pregnant naturally, but during her second cycle of treatment she  suffered a miscarriage.

When she became pregnant during her final round of IVF, she was warned she had a high risk of another miscarriage or a dangerously early labour.

Laura Dixon (pictured with husband, Tim) conceived the triplets, Mason, Max and Mia, after her third and final cycle of IVF. She says she was terrified that her body would not be able to cope with carrying three babies

So she started eating three portions of meat a day to increase her intake of iron, vitamin B12 and protein to improve her chances of a healthy pregnancy.

Mrs Dixon, who had never eaten meat, tucked into chicken, bacon and sausages every day and at 35 weeks gave birth to identical boys Max and Mason and daughter Mia.

Naturally slim, she piled on more than five stone gorging on chicken, bacon and burgers as well as a daily McDonald's breakfast and a sausage and egg McMuffin.

Her meat cravings became so strong she was tucking into three portions of meat a day with a Marks and Spencer chicken and stuffing salad sandwich her favourite snack.

The high protein diet carried her pregnancy through to 35 weeks when she gave birth to identical boys Max and Mason, and daughter Mia.

Mrs Dixon's first attempt at IVF had to be abandoned because her ovaries became dangerously swollen. She conceived after the second cycle but had a miscarriage when she was eight weeks pregnant

When she was pregnant with the triplets, Mrs Dixon decided to ditch her vegetarian diet to give herself the best chance of a successful pregnancy. She started craving meat and ate three portions a day

Ms Dixon, a PA from Essex, said: ‘When the sonographer found a third heartbeat I remember shouting “oh no” and crying - thinking I'd lose them all.

‘After losing one baby to a miscarriage, I thought I would never be able to carry three.

‘But then my hunger kicked in and despite never eating meat, I craved it. I ate about six meals a day.

‘It all seems like a blur now. I just remember the cravings were so strong that I would wake up in the night and make my husband go and get me a McDonald's.

Mrs Dixon said that her meat cravings became so strong that she had to get her husband, Tim, to go out and buy her McDonald's and Nandos - sometimes in the middle of the night

During the pregnancy, Mrs Dixon put on five stone. She says that her favourite snack was a Marks and Spencer chicken and stuffing sandwich

‘Several times my husband had to go up to Nandos for chicken and chips with me.

‘Eating meat definitely helped me get all the protein you need when you're pregnant.

‘I think it could be one of the reasons I managed to carry all three to full term.’

Ms Dixon was diagnosed with endometriosis and polycystic ovaries which doctors told her would stop her getting pregnant.

Thanks to her high protein diet, Mrs Dixon carried the triplets until she was 35 weeks pregnant. They were then delivered by C-section. Max and Mason are identical

Mrs Dixon had both polycystic ovary syndrome and endometriosis and doctors believed this would prevent her conceiving as both conditions can cause infertility

Endometriosis is a condition which causes cells from the lining of the womb to develop outside of the uterine cavity. It causes pain and, often, infertility.

Polycystic ovary syndrome is a common condition that affects how a woman's ovaries work.

It causes cysts to develop in the ovaries, stops the regular release of eggs, and causes the body to produce high levels of 'male hormones' called androgens.

She underwent two laparoscopies in a bid to correct the problems but both were unsuccessful.

Since the triplets were born, the couple have gone through 8,000 nappies and done more than 10,000 feeds

Her first cycle of IVF failed when she developed dangerously swollen ovaries and treatment had to be abandoned.

She became pregnant during the second cycle using frozen eggs but miscarried at eight weeks.

During the third IVF attempt she got ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome but decided to proceed at her own risk and two fertilised eggs developed.

Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome can occur after taking medications that stimulate the ovaries.

It causes the ovaries to swell and produce too many follicles.

Max (left) was born weighing 3lb 12oz, Mason (right) was 5lb 4oz and Mia (centre) weighed 5lb 15oz - all three were born by C-section within a minute of each other

Symptoms include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain and bloating.

In severe cases it can be life-threatening as it can cause a blood clot in an artery or vein, kidney and liver dysfunction and breathing difficulties.

However, on her 33rd birthday Mrs Dixon and her husband heard three little heartbeats and on Mr Dixon’s 33rd birthday doctors told them they were expecting identical boys and a girl.

Max was born weighing 3lb 12oz, Mason was 5lb 4oz and Mia weighed 5lb 15oz - all three were born by C-section within a minute of each other.

Since becoming a mother, Mrs Dixon has continued to go to McDonald's - but has reverted to her vegetarian diet and only has a veggie-wrap and fries

The triplets, now 14 months, were allowed home from hospital just two weeks after their birth.

Since then Mrs Dixon and Mr Dixon, 34, a finance manager, have gone through 8,000 nappies and done more than 10,000 feeds.

Medics believe Mrs Dixon’s protein boost will have contributed to her successful pregnancy.

Nutritionist Jo Travers, who runs The London Nutritionist, said: ‘There is a lot of evidence that women experience taste changes throughout the pregnancy, which in turn can alter their preferences as they progress through the trimesters.’
