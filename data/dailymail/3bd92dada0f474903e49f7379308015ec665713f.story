It was a high-speed chase that lasted 20 miles, crossing state lines from Texas to New Mexico andÂ  hitting speeds of 100 miles per hour.

But it ended with the unarmed female driver, 35-year-old Amy Reyna, before fatally shot by Denver City officer Ryan Taylor.

Now Reyna's family are suing the local police station, claiming excessive force and wrongful death in the October 2013 shooting.

Reyna was wanted for probation violations, including burglary, when she took off from police.

Disturbing footage: This is the moment Denver City police officer Ryan Taylor fatally shoots Amy Reyna, 35, following a 20-minute pursuit

Amy Reyna was wanted for parole violations when she fled from police. She was also found to be under the influence of methamphetamine at the time of the chase

The chase, which occurred in October last year, was caught on dash cam. It lasted 20-minute and moved over the Texas border into New Mexico

Following the extensive high-speed pursuit, Reyna eventually pulled off the road and drove into a farm field.

Her tires blew out and her car came to stop.

The officers ordered she put her hands up and the moment was caught on dash-cam video.

Reyna cannot be seen in the footage, so it is unclear whether she followed the orders.

Officer Taylor started firing warning shots into the engine.

Moments later he fires again but this time higher, with the shots going through the windshield, hitting Reyna.

She was pronounced dead at the scene.

An autopsy found methamphetamine in her system.

Taylor told investigators he thought Reyna had a gun.

The family of Amy Reyna have filed a lawsuit claiming her death was unnecessary and seeking unspecified damages

This footage, taken from another police car that was called in for back up, captured officer Taylor firing into Reyna's car

Officer Ryan Taylor initially fired warning shots into Amy Reyna's car, putting several bullets in the engine (pictured)

But an investigation determined she was not armed.

Joseph Zebas, a lawyer representing the Reyna family, said the video of the shooting does not match Taylor's statement.

'If Officer Taylor clearly had a fear for his safety, he would have taken cover,' Zebas said.

A lawyer for Taylor released a statement to ABC News, saying: 'Ryan protected himself and the other officers in the situation and was not responsible for the events that occurred. Amy Reyna was.'

Taylor remains on the job but may face charges in the future.
