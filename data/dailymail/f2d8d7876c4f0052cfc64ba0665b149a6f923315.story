A Chinese man's heart and wallet has suffered after he proposed to his girlfriend by spending £55,000 on 99 identical iPhones.

The unnamed man from Guangzhou, in Guangdong province, south China, spent the equivalent of more than 17 years the average worker's salary on Apple's latest mobile phone to win over his woman for life.

However, despite laying out the 99 iPhones boxes in a heart shape, the man was turned down.

National shame: The embarrassing scene has now gone viral on Chinese social media 

According to Weibo bloggers, the man asked the young lady to step into the heart where he offered her flowers and a life of marital bliss. 

What she actually said to him has not been reported, but witnesses said she well and truly rejected him. 

It is not known whether she took a phone as payment for her embarrassment and the waste of time.

But from all accounts the rejected suitor now has the job of trying to get some of his money back selling the phones at a discounted price.
