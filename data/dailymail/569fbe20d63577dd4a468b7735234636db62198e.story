An ice cream man caught with a cache of weapons hidden inside his van told police he needed the knives to open boxes of chocolate flakes.

Grant Minchion, 23, was keeping nunchucks - a type of martial arts weapon - a throwing knife, lock knife and Stanley knife in the vehicle.

When police stopped the van on October 14, Minchion claimed to have been given the throwing knife - which he said was useful for opening boxes of flakes - by a 'kid' in exchange for a Cornetto ice cream.

Alison Warburton, prosecuting, said: 'During the course of a search, police found a lock knife in a draw with money.

'The nunchucks were in the glovebox and knives in a sink behind the driver. The defendant was arrested and interviewed.

'Regarding the nunchucks, he said "I wouldn't know what to call them but I know what they are". 

'He said they belonged to someone else - an 18-year-old male - and the other male had brought them into the van in April because he was being bullied.

'He said "I intended to give them back but it slipped my mind because I was busy with work".

'The throwing knife he said was used to cut open boxes and had been given by a kid on his round.'

Minchion, of Warrington, Lancashire, also claimed the Stanley knife and lock knife were used for 'opening stock'.

He pleaded guilty at Halton Magistrates Court to two counts of possessing an offensive weapon and two counts of possessing a bladed article in a public place.

The court heard he has no previous convictions, and that there was no allegation that any of the weapons had been used to commit a crime.

Minchion, who no longer has the ice cream van and is now on benefits, will be sentenced on November 24.
