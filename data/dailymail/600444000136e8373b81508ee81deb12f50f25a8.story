It is pouring with rain in Kensington Gardens as designer-clad stars emerge from limousines and dash into the gleaming glass marquee where the Burberry Prorsum show is about to begin.

Inside though, it felt like the brightest of summer days as the British design house showed its SS14 collection to a full – and star-studded - house.

With Sienna Miller, Harry Styles, Naomi Harris, Suki Waterhouse and Paloma Faith watching from the front row, Christopher Bailey showed a feminine, genteel collection – he described it as ‘tender’ - replete with Victorian lace in soft macarón hues of mint and rose, mauve and lavender, gentle shapes that borrowed just enough from the archives, the occasional graphic print in black and white or a splash of red, and a (sometimes liberal) sprinkling of bling.

Round of applause: The petal-strewn finale of Christopher Bailey's blockbuster show at Burberry Prorsum in Kensington Gardens

Ever the innovator with fabric, 
Bailey discovered a factory in the North of England that still had 
Victorian lace machines in full working order – and he used them to 
create featherlight pencil skirts and dresses in pale pistachio, cream 
and the faintest whisper of mauve.

But, this being Bailey, he also took 
this most traditional of fabrics and breathed modern life into it, 
tinting it black and white stripes or turning it into a trench-inspired 
shirt dress.

Pencil skirts 
prevailed, coming in that beautiful Nottingham lace, baby soft cashmere that draped at the hips and gathered into a twisted knot at the front (office wear for those too wealthy to work) as well as vivid monochrome 
stripes – which was paired with a spot shirt set surely to take over from the heart print
 as the piece that makes it to the mainstream ( I spotted at least 20 people wearing THAT heart shirt at the show today).

Thanks
 to Bailey’s love of Scottish cashmere, the Burberry girl will be kept 
warm next spring with baby soft, slouchy cardigans in grey, mint and 
pink.  

Outerwear was softer in general. Light cashmere overcoats in pale grey or white, a single-breasted coat in dusky pink.

The trench in its most traditional form - beige, gabardine, belted - was entirely absent. 
Instead, Bailey said, he wanted to introduce the elements of the trench 
but in a gentler way.

That 
meant stripping out the lining, using softer fabrics, softer shapes, and more generous
 cuts that enveloped and cocooned the figure rather than necessarily cinching it.

Sorbet: Bailey plumped for a hugely pretty palette with sugary shades of pistachio, lemon, candyfloss and delicate almond dominating

Always soulful, haunting, epic. Playlist was: Benjamin Twine, by George Ezra. Man On The Moon by Jake Bugg. When We Were On Fire (The Mahogany Sessions) by James Bay. Budapest by George Ezra. Bailey does the hard work so we can download and discover them.

'I wanted this idea of everything being much more soft, 
much more gentle,' he said after the show. 'I liked the idea of taking out all the linings, all 
but the most essential part of the trench. 

I liked the idea of taking the traditional trench coat, the iconic 
Burberry trenchcoat but then reimagining it with these soft, fluid 
fabrics. So we used a lot of double-faced cashmeres, we used a lot of 
silks, so that everything had a very natural flow.

'Fabric is the
 DNA of our brand,' he added. 'Thomas Burberry, our founder, invented gabardine, and
 it's something care about greatly. We have a whole team of people and 
all they do is work through the innovation, craftsmanship and 
construction of fabric.

'Everything was soft and feminine and had that sense of kind of wrapping yourself in things.

'There was kind of tenderness, a vulnerability.'

The colour palette - those dusky pinks and greens, palest yellow, sugary soft hues, were borne of Bailey's love of the English rose - hence the thousands of petals that rained down on the catwalk during the finale.

'I wanted the colours to be soft and gentle, like sugared flowers,' Bailey said.

'We've
 been talking about this English rose and the breadth and depth of the 
colours. We tried to distill that, so there's a powderiness to the 
colours as well as them just being pastel.'

Trench detail was borrowed and used elsewhere. A
 deep sage coat-dress had a scoop neck that echoed the traditional lapel
 of the trench, a mint-green filigree shirt-dress used trench detailing at the 
back and trench lapels; Cara D walked in a transparent trench cape dotted with dusky pink 
beading.

The
 mood was certainly gentler than previous seasons (especially given that
 last season PVC pencil skirts were the look of the season). It was, 
said Bailey, meant to be warm, soft and a little bit romantic.

‘I
 wanted the show to be gentle, to feel enveloping,’ he said afterwards. 
‘I wanted it to have a real crafted feeling, something that 
felt you were really cocooned and protected. It was very feminine, 
gentle and soft. But there was a sassiness and a sexiness underneath, 
and I like that idea of strength and fragility.’

Cara Delevingne walked, as did 
Jourdan Dunn. It is, Bailey agreed, important to have those big names 
walking. In truth though, Cara has been part of the Burberry gang long 
before she was the ‘model of the moment'.

'We
 have always loved Cara,’ Bailey said fondly, as the lady herself leapt around backstage 
wearing a balaclava and giving out bearhugs. ‘She’s part of the Burberry
 family.

'We have worked with Cara for many, many years,' he added. 'She's someone I'm very close to. We have a wonderful relationship. I just adore Cara, she's beautiful.

Soft with underlying sassiness: Cocooning overcoats, delicate lace, macrame and silk. Trench coats had lining stripped out, softer material was used

Graphic: Despite a genteel colour palette and the softness of lace elsewhere, Bailey made sure to maintain his trademark sassiness with cheeky prints

Snappers: Alexa Chung, Poppy Delevingne and Jamal Edwards take in the graphic prints that shot through the pastels

Romantic: A softer aesthetic at Burberry today - in contrast to the rubber skirts of last season - though there was a sense of sassiness too. 'Both fragility and strength.' said Bailey

It's one of London Fashion Week's 
biggest draws and this season's outing from Burberry proved to be no 
exception. The cream of London's style set - as well as heavy hitters from around the world - turned out to see the latest effort from Christopher Bailey at the Kensington Gardens show.

Among the biggest of the big names was US Vogue editor Anna Wintour, who joined Topshop supremo Sir Phillip Green and socialite Olivia Palermo on the front row.

Celebrities paying Bailey the compliment of wearing Burberry to the show included Sienna Miller, who wore a black felt dress from the A/W13 collection and One Direction singer Harry Styles who plumped for a daring £395 leopard print military shirt.

Donna Air also turned out in Burberry, choosing a stylish crocodile pencil skirt and a soft nappa leather tank. She was joined by actress Gabriella Wilde, the half-sister of Prince Harry's girlfriend Cressida Bonas, and 21-year-old model, Suki Waterhouse.

Rounding off the stellar front row was Alexa Chung, model Arizona Muse and flame-haired singer Paloma Faith who was resplendent in - of course - a chic Burberry skirt.

English Rose: British model Cara Delevingne with classic sleek hair

An edgier version of the classic English rose was Christopher Kane's beauty vision at Burberry and lead stylist Neil Moodie was the man asked to provide it.

'Christopher Bailey’s inspiration for the collection is English Rose distressed,' explained the hair guru. 'This is why I decided to blow dry the hair in a classic sleek - but not poker straight - as would be expected of an English Rose. I then texturised and mattified the hair with Moroccanoil products to give it an edgy, distressed look.'

Moodie began by preparing wet hair with a Moroccanoil treatment before adding the brand's Frizz Control to make sure hair stayed beautifully smooth. 'Next, I applied Moroccanoil Hydrating Styling Cream before blow drying the hair to ensure the movement created by the blow dry held and to give it a more luxury finish,' explained Neil.

Luckily for those who want to recreate the look, it's one that works with any hair type. 'For thick hair, I blowdried it with a natural centre parting,' adds Neil. 'For long hair, I created some movement by flicking the ends under in a natural way.'

Once the hair was dry, it was divided it into sections and finished with Moroccanoil Luminous Hairspray and Moroccanoil Volumising Mousse to add texture and create a matte finish.'

Neil added: 'Before the models went on to the catwalk, the hair was tucked into the coats, and few stray sections were released at the back and side.'

Beauty was created by Wendy Rowe using Burberry and introducing the Spring/Summer colours and Burberry nails.
