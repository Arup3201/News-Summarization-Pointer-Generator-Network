David Cameron has been urged by a Labour MP to give Dave Whelan's donation to the Conservative Party of £1.5million to charity in light of the Wigan owner's 'anti-Semitic and racist' remarks.

Labour MP Karl Turner has written to the prime minister to suggest it would be more fitting the money Whelan has given to the Tories since 2007 be distributed to charities.

Whelan has been forced to apologise for comments he made following the appointment of Malky Mackay, who is being investigated by the FA after Sportsmail revealed the 42-year-old sent and received racist, sexist and homophobic texts while he was manager of Cardiff City.

Turner calls on Cameron to ‘personally condone or condemn’ the 77-year-old’s comments, with Whelan’s most recent contribution £100,000 in August 2014.

Whelan sparked outrage on Thursday, making extraordinarily offensive remarks about Jewish people and the Chinese while defending his appointment of Mackay.

'The Jews don't like losing money,' Whelan said. 'Nobody likes losing money. Do you think Jewish people chase money a little bit more than we do?

'I think they are very shrewd people. It's telling the truth. Jewish people love money, English people love money; we all love money.

'If any Englishman said he has never called a Chinaman a "chink" he is lying. There is nothing bad about doing that. It's like calling the British Brits or the Irish paddies.'

Turner, a Labour MP for Kingston upon Hull East, writes in his letter that Cameron’s leadership should be questioned if he fails to 'act swiftly in this matter'.

'Given his status as a significant contributor to your re-election efforts you must now make it clear if you personally condone or condemn these comments. 

'I hope that you agree with me that these anti-Semitic and racist comments have no place in modern British society, and as such I hope that you also agree with me that you must now give up any money that you have received from Mr Whelan and consider which charitable groups would be better recipients of it.

'Failure to act swiftly in this matter will show a lack of leadership. It will not be possible for you to simultaneously condemn offensive remarks while accepting large sums of money from those responsible for them.'
