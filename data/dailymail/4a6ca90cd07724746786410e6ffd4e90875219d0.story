The new year is already proving to be a great one for the British, as our men dominate the sexiest actors list, but unfortunately our girls aren't faring as well.

British star Tom Hiddleston has toppled Twilight's Robert Pattinson from his position as 'sexiest actor alive', according to a new poll.

Hiddleston - whose roles have included War Horse and will soon return as villain Loki in Thor 2 - topped the list in a poll for Total Film magazine.

Tom gained notoriety by playing Captain Nicholls in War Horse; director Steven Spielberg's epic adventure set against a sweeping canvas of rural England and Europe during the First World War

Canadian actor Ryan Gosling comes third on the list while another Briton Benedict Cumberbatch takes fourth place

Jennifer Lawrence, who starred in The 
Hunger Games and landed a Golden Globe for Silver Linings Playbook this 
week, was judged to be the sexiest woman in the list.

Hiddleston, 31, was taken aback by his triumph. He said: 'My sister used to say I had hair like a broom. She was probably right.

'One of the great flaws we all share is that we think everyone else is cool, everyone else is sexier, everyone else has all the answers. That was me too.'

More than 25,000 people cast their votes for the magazine's annual poll, which saw last year's winner Pattinson at number two. His Twilight co-star Kristen Stewart was third in the actress list, behind Scarlett Johansson.

Striking a blow for the more mature actor is Alan Rickman - noted for his role as Severus Snape in the Harry Potter films - who was ranked in seventh place at the age of 66. He beat stars such as Brad Pitt and George Clooney.

James Bond star Daniel Craig finished at number 15 in the list published today in the magazine.

Total Film editor Jane Crowther said: 'The thousands of readers who voted clearly show that the concept of sexy doesn't fit a stereotype - though it's very good news for British men judging by the number of British gents making the top ten.'
