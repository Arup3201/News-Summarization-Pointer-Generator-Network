In a new twist in the continuing saga of missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370, a towelette that was washed up on a Western Australia beach is now being examined to try and find out if it could have come from the disappeared plane.

The small pre-moistened paper towel that was in a Malaysia Airlines sealed packet has been sent to Canberra for testing and verification after being found  by a couple walking along a beach in Cervantes in July last year, Nine News reported.

The news comes just days after the one year anniversary of the plane's disappearance, with 239 people on board. 

Kingsley and Vicki Miller discovered the unopened packet at Cervantes, 200 kilometres north of Perth, and said it was ‘unopened, which was very unusual’.

'If it had of been opened and found lying there it would have been completely different,' Mr Miller said.

The Daily Telegraph reported that experts believe it's possible for a small package such as the towelette to travel long distances without sustaining damage. 

However, experts believe that the package may not provide any helpful information as to the disappearance of the plane.

'A 6cm x 8cm moist towelette in wrapping branded with the Malaysia Airlines logo was found at Thirsty Point on 2 July 2014. It was handed in to the WA police,' said a spokesperson for the Australian Transport Safety Bureau.

'It is unlikely, however, that such a common item with no unique identifier could be conclusively linked with MH370,' reported The Sydney Morning Herald. 

The plane dropped off the civilian radar after its transponder and other equipment were switched off shortly after takeoff from Kuala Lumpur. It was then tracked by Malaysia’s military radar heading towards the Indian Ocean.

The MH370 flight disappeared on the May 8 with 239 people on board

The anniversary of the plane's disappearance was matched by a report which revealed that the battery of an underwater locator beacon on the flight had expired more than a year before the incident. 

The update on the progress of the probe surrounding the Malaysia Airlines plane indicates those looking for the aircraft would have had less chance of finding it.  

Apart from the anomaly of the beacon, the report devoted many of its 584 pages to describe the complete normality of the flight - shedding little light on one of aviation's biggest mysteries.

The significance of the expired battery was not immediately apparent, except indicating that searchers would have had lesser chance of locating the plane, even if they were in its vicinity. 

The report said: ‘The sole objective of the investigation is the prevention of future accidents or incidents, and not for the purpose to apportion blame or liability.’

Whilst the battery had expired on the beacon of the Flight Data Recorder, the report said that the battery on the locator beacon of the cockpit voice recorder was working.

However, in a statement on Monday, Malaysia Airlines said that a similar beacon was also installed with the solid state cockpit voice recorder and its battery life was still good. 

Relatives of passengers and crew marked the anniversary of the day the plane went missing, under a heavy police presence.

Chinese relatives had planned to commemorate the disappearance of the Boeing 777 at a number of sites in Beijing, including the Malaysian embassy, the airport and the Lama Temple, a popular Tibetan Buddhist place of worship and tourist site.

Flight Captain: Zaharie Ahmad Shah

The physical and mental well-being of Flight Captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah was examined by the report, which said he had no known history of apathy, anxiety or irritability.

‘There were no significant changes in his lifestyle, interpersonal conflict or family stresses,’ it said.

It also said there were ‘no behavioural signs of social isolation, change in habits or interest, self-neglect, drug or alcohol abuse’ by the captain, his first officer and the cabin crew.

Financial checks also showed nothing abnormal about their gross monthly income and spending pattern. It said the captain held several bank accounts and two national trust funds.

He had two houses and three vehicles, but there was no record of him having a life insurance policy.

The co-pilot, First Officer Fariq Abdul Hamid, had two saving accounts and a national trust fund account.

He owned two cars and ‘spent money on the upkeep’ of these vehicles. ‘He does not have much savings in his bank account. He has a life insurance policy,’ it said.

Dozens of uniformed security sealed the street around the diplomatic mission, while relatives said they had opted to avoid the airport as police were out in force. 

About 30 visited the Lama Temple, with around 10 entering the site in groups of two or three to pay their personal respects, as if attempting to keep a low profile. 

The remainder waited outside the temple in a group, wearing T-shirts saying ‘Pray for MH370’, and waving placards to photographers reading ‘Keep searching for MH370’.

Meanwhile, Voice 370 - a support group for the relatives - hosted a ‘Day of Remembrance’ at a shopping centre in Kuala Lumpur with songs, poems and prayers.

Grace Subathirai Nathan, whose mother Anne Daisy was on the plane, said: ‘It is important to highlight to the public that we still don't have any answers and that we must pursue the search.’

The Malaysian prime minister said he still is hopeful the plane will be found.

Najib Razak said: ‘The lack of answers and definitive proof - such as aircraft wreckage - has made this more difficult to bear.

‘Together with our international partners, we have followed the little evidence that exists. Malaysia remains committed to the search, and hopeful that MH370 will be found.’

While the country's government has already formally declared the disappearance of the plane as an accident, and said all those on board are presumed dead, relatives of those on the flight have said they are frustrated by the lack of answers.

Ministers from Australia, China and Malaysia are expected to meet next month to decide on the next course of action for the wide-ranging search.

Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said his government would provide ‘all needed service to every next of kin’ and help uphold their ‘legitimate and lawful rights and interests’.

Most of the plane's passengers were Chinese.

‘A year has passed, the plane has not been located, but the search effort will continue,’ Mr Wang told a news conference in Beijing. ‘Today must be a difficult day for the next of kin. Our hearts are with you.’  

As his country said prayers on Sunday for those who were on board the missing flight, Malaysia's Prime Minister said no words could describe their pain.

'The lack of answers and definitive proof - such as aircraft wreckage - has made this more difficult to bear,' said Mr Najib Razak.

'No words can describe the pain the families of those on board are going through.'

Search and rescue missions were conducted for the flight off the coast of Perth

China's Foreign Minister, Wang Yi, said in Beijing that the search for the Malaysia Airlines flight which vanished one year ago today will not stop.

'The search for MH370 will continue,' said Mr Wang, echoing the previously-spoken commitment of the countries involved in the hunt for the aircraft - Australia, Malaysia and China - in the southern Indian Ocean. 

In Kuala Lumpur, Mr Najib spoke of the joint effort, adding in his official statement that 'together with our international partners, we have followed the little evidence that exists.

'Malaysia remains committed to the search and hopeful that MH370 will be found.'

Although Mr Abbott said he was confident the aircraft would be found as 40 per cent of 60,000 square kilometres of deep ocean off the coast of Western Australian had been scrutinised and another 60,000sq km to be covered if necessary, he added that the search had to end at some stage.

'It is one of the great mysteries of the 21st century and I know that there will be a nagging doubt in the minds of billions of people until such time as we can find that plane,' he told reporters in Sydney on Sunday.

'It can't go on forever but, as long as there are reasonable leads, the search will go on.'  

It is one year since Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 went missing. Here is a timeline of the main events over the last 12 months.
