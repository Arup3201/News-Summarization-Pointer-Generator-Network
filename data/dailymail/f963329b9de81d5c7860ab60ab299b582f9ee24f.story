Christmas spirit is in short supply in Denham Springs, Louisiana where a woman has been forced to take down her holiday lights after neighbors complained about the not very subtle message she was sending them.

Sarah Henderson, a mother of four children aged between 4 and 16,  admits she deliberately fashioned her light display to look like a human hand ‘flipping the bird’. 

Henderson says the middle finger salute was a message to some of her neighbors whom she has been involved in a year-long dispute with.

Christmas may be over, but Sarah Henderson wants to continue with her 'rude' lighting display to get her own back a neighbor

Henderson now says the display was a message to a neighbor who she believes stole her dog

'They put themselves into affairs of mine that they had no business in,’ she told WBRZ. ‘They spread vicious lies throughout the neighborhood.’

Henderson agreed to remove the offending display after she received a visit from Denham Spring Police. Corporal Shawn Perkins informed Henderson that her display was in violation of obscenity laws and that she faced the possibility of a $300 or $400 fine.

Henderson says she could have fought the request, but she decided to take the lights down out of respect for her mayor and city council.

One local neighbor, Gemma Rachel told WBRZ that while she hasn't have anything personal against Henderson, she didn’t think the lights were an appropriate symbol for young children to be exposed to.

‘Christmas lights should be something for kids to enjoy’ she told WBRZ.

Since taking down her lights, Henderson has received support from the American Civil Liberties Union of Louisiana.

Henderson has twice removed the lights from her roof, but with the support of the American Civil Liberties Union of Louisiana she is attempting to sue the city, its mayor and police

Marjorie Essman, executive director at the ACLU, has sent a letter to the Denham Springs chief of police saying the city has no right to 'restrict Henderson's expression purely because it, or Henderson's neighbors, finds it vulgar or offensive.'

In the letter, Esman wrote: 'The Fifth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeal, which presides over Louisiana, Texas and Mississippi, has specifically commented on the protected expressive nature of a middle finger extended in defiance or protest: "The thumbed nose, the projected middle finger, the Bronx cheer, the grimace and the smile are all conduct intended to convey a message that is sometimes made even more expressive by its bold freedom from a garb of words." Davis v. Williams.'

Henderson has said she is thinking about replacing the extended finger with a swastika.
