A thief was so consumed by guilt after hearing a giant cuddly toy he stole from a garden centre was being raffled off for charity that he gave himself up to police.

Brodie Few, 26, walked into a police station clutching the 4ft tall soft bear that he had taken from the store in Weymouth, Dorset, after a CCTV appeal was launched to track him down.

He claimed he was unaware the teddy was being raffled off in honour of former staff member, Lyn Weaver, who had died of breast cancer two months before the theft.

Staff at Goulds Garden Centre aimed to raise £1,000 for Cancer Research and were stunned when Few walked out of the store with the toy and a second prize - a slow cooker - under his arm.

It was after Few spotted the CCTV appeal and was wracked with guilt at what he had done, a court heard.

Ian Brazier, defending, told magistrates in Weymouth: 'He hadn't registered that the items were for a charity raffle.

'When he saw the CCTV images that is what we felt the worst about and registered that he was the person being sought.'

Mr Brazier said Few suffered from epilepsy and a frontal lobe brain tumour which affects his memory.

He pleaded guilty to a charge of theft at an earlier court hearing and District Judge Stephen Nicholls said he took this into account along with the fact he had returned the items to the police. 

He sentenced Few to a community order, a five-week curfew restricting him from leaving his home between the hours of 7pm and 7am and told to pay court costs and fines of £145.

Anthony Gould, director at Goulds Garden Centre, said: 'All of the staff here were devastated and very angry when they learned that items from the charity raffle set up in Lyn's memory had been targeted by thieves.

'Lyn was a much loved colleague and it was beyond belief that anyone could sink as low as to steal from a display set up in memory of our colleague that was raising money for Cancer Research and Mosaic, a charity set up to support bereaved children.

'However those feelings were quickly overshadowed by an overwhelming sense of support. We were literally inundated with messages of support with many people and businesses donating raffle prizes to replace the ones stolen.'

Goulds Garden Centre released the CCTV footage after thieves brazenly walked out of the store with the huge teddy bear and a slow cooker - that were due to be auctioned off for charities Cancer Research and Mosaic

Few can be seen admiring the bear in the CCTV footage, which he later spotted and feeling wracked with guilt, handed himself into police along with the items

The CCTV footage shows three other suspects who appear to have been working alongside Few.

Mr Gould said: 'Despite the positive result, we are still left very disappointed that the other three people involved in the theft have yet to do the right thing and hand themselves in.

'They obviously have no conscious whatsoever and are quite happy for their so called friend to take all of the blame.'

'Rather than any prosecution it was more important to us that the friends, colleagues, family and acquaintances of these people all knew that that they were in fact common thieves quite happy to steal from a charity. 

A court heard he was unaware of the charity campaign when he took the items and suffered from epilepsy and a frontal lobe brain tumour which affects his memory

Few was given a community order, a five-week curfew restricting him from leaving his home between the hours of 7pm and 7am and told to pay court costs and fines of £145
