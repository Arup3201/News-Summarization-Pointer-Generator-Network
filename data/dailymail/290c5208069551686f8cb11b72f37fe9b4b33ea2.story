Sunbathing in her family's cottage garden on a glorious day in July, Courtenay Zurenko, felt happy and content. Two months before she had given birth to her son Riley and she and her husband Joe loved being first-time parents.

'Life was wonderful,' Courtenay told Mail Online.

'We were blessed by becoming pregnant very quickly. I had always wanted to be a mother, so I was overjoyed that it was a reality.'

Yet within a month, the 29-year-old from
a Chicago suburb was close to death after suffering three terrifying 
seizures in hospital - and it could all have been caused by that 
afternoon out in the summer heat.

Happy and healthy again: Courtenay with her son Riley, who she was too weak to hold during her illness

Courtenay had developed a rare auto-immune condition called dermatomyositis. The condition, which affects only one in 100,000 people causes painful skin rashes, muscle weakness and difficulty swallowing. It can kills up to five per cent of people who get it.

But when Mrs Zurenko first started to develop a purplish rash on her chest both she and her doctors were stumped.

'I first thought it was sunburn but it had spread and become very itchy,' she recalls. 'I went to a dermatologist who ran tests and they thought it might be lupus (where the immune system attacks healthy cells) but they weren't sure.'

'Then one evening I tried to pick Riley up and nearly dropped him because my arms were so weak. I went to numerous outpatient departments and every doctor ran blood tests, but they all came back negative.'

Mrs Zurenko was finally diagnosed with the muscle condition at Loyola University Medical Center after rheumatologist Dr Ruth Kadanoff noticed a scaly rash on her knuckles - a typical symptom of the disease. Courtenay's immune system was mistakenly attacking her own healthy tissue so she was put on a course of steroids to suppress her immune system.

At first, the mother-of-one began to improve although she said she still felt like she 'had cement in every limb.'  But a week later she took a dramatic turn for the worse. Her eyes became swollen and she found she couldn't swallow.

'It was very scary. I had already lost a lot of weight and I didn't know what would happen next,' she said.

'I didn't want to do too much research as I was afraid of reading worst case scenarios. Thankfully my parents lived nearby and could look after Riley, while my husband worked and took me to hospital.'

Mrs Zurenko was admitted back into hospital in October 2011 after tests revealed she had extremely high blood pressure. This had been triggered by a rare reaction to the steroids she had received to suppress her immune system.

It was when she was talking to her husband in her hospital room that she had her first of three terrifying seizures.

'I remember feeling light-headed and then the TV seemed to swirl in front of me,' she recalled.

'I said: "Joe, something is terribly wrong, help me," and then I blacked out.'

Minutes later she had a second 
seizure and was rushed to intensive care where she had her third 
episode. Her husband could only watch and wait to see if she would 
recover.

Dermatomyositis is a rare inflammatory disease marked by muscle weakness and a distinctive purpley-red skin rash.

It is an auto-immune disorder, which means the immune system mistakenly attacks and destroys healthy body tissue.  The exact cause is unknown.

The condition affects one in 100,000 people but is twice as common in women than in men. It can occur at any age but usually affects adults aged 40-60.

The main symptoms are...: Rash across the face, eyelids, knuckles, elbows, knees and chest.

: Progressive muscle weakness involving muscles closest to the trunk, such as hips, shoulders, upper arms and neck

: Difficulty swallowing and weight loss

It is treated with anti-inflammatory medicines called corticosteroids and drugs to suppress the immune system.

The condition can disappear on its own in about a fifth of patients. Most patients survive but may be left with weakness and disability. In around five per cent of cases it can progress quickly leading to death.

'The doctors 
told me that if I had had a fourth seizure I could have been left with 
severe brain damage or even died,' Mrs Zurenko said.

An
MRI revealed her high blood pressure had caused lesions to form on her 
brain, which had triggered the seizures. Thankfully, after three days 
she began to recover.

As
her strength slowly returned the mother was checked 'from head to toe' 
to see whether she was suffering from any other conditions such as 
cancer, but these all came back clear.

It was then that doctors revealed what they thought had caused her ordeal - a simple case of sunburn back in July.

'That
afternoon when I had enjoyed laying out in the sun the temperature was 
in the 80s (25C-30C). I had put sunscreen on but coming inside I 
remember I was a little pink,' she said.

Research shows that when your skin is exposed to ultraviolet light it 
may cause many of your skin cells to die. These dead cells are powerful 
stimulators of the immune system, and in Mrs Zurenko's case may have caused her body to overeact.

'Amazingly
they said that was what could have triggered it, perhaps also because 
my immune system was low from after having my baby. It just seemed so 
incredible.'

Mrs Zurenko was put on an IVIG - a 
blood product chock full of immunoglobulin (antibodies that fight 
disease) taken from the plasma of hundreds of donors.

'I got so much better after that,' she said.

'I
had spent my first week in ICU, then my second week out in a normal 
ward although I couldn't eat food without help or move myself.

'By the third week I was in the rehabilitation section. I was sitting up in my chair and could go to the bathroom with help.

'The day I could eat on my own they brought me a piece of chocolate cake.'

Out of hospital: Courtenay, her husband Joe and son Riley lived with her parents for a few months while she regained her strength

Mrs Zurenko left hospital in a wheelchair and bought a wig as her various treatments had caused her hair to fall out. She started physio exercises while staying with her parents.

'Before long I was dressing myself and although I needed help with Riley I could pick him up again, which was just wonderful,' she said.

But she still had an emotional battle to fight.

'I had felt very depressed when I became ill as I couldn't look after Riley,' she said.

'And after I left hospital I was very anxious that I would have another seizure.'

When she went back to the hospital 
six weeks later she was thrilled to be told her lesions had gone and 
helped her to focus on getting better.

'The last year has been wonderful,' she said.

'My
husband, son and I moved back from my parents to our own house, my hair
has grown back and a few months ago I started working part time in a 
gift shop.

Mrs Zurenko is now working part-time at a gift shop and says her illness has given her a new positive perspective on life

'I also wrote a book about my experience. I realised that I could connect with other people from talking about my own battle and hearing what other people had gone through. It gave me a new perspective and I really appreciate what I used to think of as chores.

'Although I've had a few skin flare-ups I'm learning how to manage the stress that can cause them.'

Courtenay's biggest joy is that she can look after her son again.

'Riley is 18-months-old now and is very energetic, but I can keep up!' she said.

'Just over a year ago I couldn't see any light at the end of the tunnel, now I appreciate the peace and joy a new perspective has given me.'

Courtenay Zurenko has written a memoir called 'Seizing Faith: Feeling God's Hands Through His Life-Changing Plans.'
