A mysterious new disease 
has left scores of people in Asia and some in the U.S. with AIDS-like 
symptoms even though they are not infected with HIV.

The patients' immune systems become damaged, leaving them 
unable to fend off germs as healthy people do. What triggers this is unknown 
but the disease does not seem to be contagious.

It appears to be another kind of acquired immune deficiency that is 
not inherited and occurs in adults.

However it doesn't spread the way AIDs does through 
a virus, said Dr Sarah Browne, a scientist at the National Institute of Allergy 
and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), which is part of the National Institute of Health.

Dr Sarah K. Browne, right, talks with patient Kim Nguyen at the National Institute of Health. Researchers have identified a mysterious new disease with AIDS-like symptoms even though they are not infected with HIV

She helped lead the study with researchers in Thailand and 
Taiwan where most of the cases have been found since 2004. Their report is in 
Thursday's New England Journal of Medicine.

'This is absolutely fascinating. I've seen probably at least 
three patients in the last 10 years or so' who might have had this, said Dr. 
Dennis Maki, an infectious disease specialist at the University of Wisconsin in 
Madison.

It's still possible that an infection of some sort could 
trigger the disease, even though the disease itself doesn't seem to spread 
person-to-person, he said.

The disease develops around age 50 on average but does not 
run in families, which makes it unlikely that a single gene is responsible, 
Browne said. Some patients have died of overwhelming infections, including some 
Asians now living in the U.S., although Browne could not estimate how many.

Kim Nguyen, 62, a seamstress from Vietnam who has lived in 
Tennessee since 1975, was gravely ill when she sought help for a persistent 
fever, infections throughout her bones and other bizarre symptoms in 2009. She 
had been sick off and on for several years and had visited Vietnam in 1995 and 
again in early 2009.

Research from the NIAID, part of the National Institute of Health (pictured), reveals the disease causes patients' immune systems to become damaged, leaving them unable to fend off germs. What triggers this isn't known

'She was wasting away from this systemic infection' that at 
first seemed like tuberculosis but wasn't, said Dr Carlton Hays Jr., a family 
physician at the Jackson Clinic in Jackson, Tennessee. 'She's a small woman to begin 
with, but when I first saw her, her weight was 91 pounds, and she lost down to 
69 pounds.'

Nguyen (pronounced 'when') was referred to specialists at 
the National Institutes of Health who had been tracking similar cases. She spent 
nearly a year at an NIH hospital in Bethesda, Maryland, and is there now for 
monitoring and further treatment.

'I feel great now,' she said on Wednesday. But when she was 
sick, 'I felt dizzy, headaches, almost fell down,' she said. 'I could not eat 
anything.'

AIDS is a specific disease, and it stands for acquired 
immune deficiency syndrome. That means the immune system becomes impaired during 
someone's lifetime, rather than from inherited gene defects like the 'bubble 
babies' who are born unable to fight off germs.

The virus that causes AIDS - HIV - destroys T-cells, key 
soldiers of the immune system that fight germs. The new disease doesn't affect 
those cells, but causes a different kind of damage. Browne's study of more than 
200 people in Taiwan and Thailand found that most of those with the disease make 
substances called auto-antibodies that block interferon-gamma, a chemical signal 
that helps the body clear infections.

Blocking that signal leaves people like those with AIDS - 
vulnerable to viruses, fungal infections and parasites, but especially 
micobacteria, a group of germs similar to tuberculosis that can cause severe 
lung damage. Researchers are calling this new disease an 'adult-onset' 
immunodeficiency syndrome because it develops later in life and they don't know 
why or how.

'Fundamentally, we do not know what's causing them to make 
these antibodies,' Browne said.

Antibiotics aren't always effective, so doctors have tried a 
variety of other approaches, including a cancer drug that helps suppress 
production of antibodies. The disease quiets in some patients once the 
infections are tamed, but the faulty immune system is likely a chronic 
condition, researchers believe.

The fact that nearly all the patients so far have been Asian 
or Asian-born people living elsewhere suggests that genetic factors and 
something in the environment such as an infection may trigger the disease, 
researchers conclude.

The first cases turned up in 2004 and Browne's study 
enrolled about 100 people in six months.

'We know there are many others out there,' including many 
cases mistaken as tuberculosis in some countries, she said.
