Lane from Irwin, North Carolina is a two-time Adult Video News Award winner, according to TMZ.

In a biography on IMDb, the porn star is said to have worked at restaurant chain Hooters, an adult bookstore, and as a stripper in several Florida clubs before she joined the adult film industry.

During the flight earlier this week, the porn star was reportedly restrained the last 45 minutes of it before it landed at LAX's Terminal 6 around 8pm.

Lane was dragged away 'kicking and screaming' and was detained by three flight crew members before also assaulting a police officer.

She  was arrested around 2am on Thursday for suspicion of battery on a police officer and public drunkenness, according to KTLA.
