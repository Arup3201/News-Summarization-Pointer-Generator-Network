Slovakia's main political parties have reached a deal to approve changes to an EU bailout fund this week, the main opposition leader said today -just one day after parliament rejected the proposal, causing the government to fall.

Robert Fico, head of Smer-Social Democracy, said that in exchange for his party's votes, three outgoing government party leaders have agreed to hold early general elections on March 10.

He said: 'Slovakia will ratify the EU bailout fund without any problems. I believe it will happen on Friday this week at the latest,'

Collapsed: In a desperate effort to force a vote in favour of the bailout fund, Prime Minister Iveta Radicova tied it to a confidence vote - the one-year-old government subsequently collapsed

Tuesday's vote on the bail out failed because a junior coalition party, the Freedom and Solidarity party, was against it.

In a desperate effort to force that 
party to vote in favour of the bailout fund, Prime Minister Iveta 
Radicova tied the vote to a confidence vote - but it failed causing her one-year-old government to collapse.

With the government defunct - and 
with the promise of early elections - Fico said his party will now vote 
in favour of the bailout fund, which all 16 other members of the 
eurozone have already supported.

The leaders of three coalition parties
- Mikulas Dzurinda of the Slovak Democratic and Christian Union, which 
Radicova belongs to; Jan Figel of the Christian Democrats and Bela Bugar
of a party of ethnic Hungarians - confirmed the deal.

Bugar said. 'We had to pay a political price. And the early election is the price.'

Just one day after parliament rejected the proposal causing the government to fall, Slovakia's main political parties have reached a deal to approve changes to an EU bailout

Opposition party leader, and former prime minister, Robert Fico said: 'Slovakia will ratify the EU bailout fund without any problems. I believe it will happen on Friday this week at the latest'

The announcement came hours after EU 
President Herman Van Rompuy and European Commission President Jose 
Manuel Barroso called on Slovak political parties 'to rise above the 
positioning of short-term politics, and seize the next occasion to 
ensure a swift adoption of the new agreement.'

They said the enhancement of the 
â‚¬44billion Euro European Financial Stability Facility is crucial 'to 
preserve financial stability in the euro area. And that is in the 
interest of all euro countries, including the Slovak people.'

Eurozone leaders had agreed in July to
increase the size and powers of the bailout fund, giving it the ability
to lend quickly to governments in case of market trouble in order to 
contain the stubborn financial crisis.

Fico's populist leftist party is by 
far the strongest political force in Slovakia and stands a good chance 
to win the early ballot. It won last year's general elections in June 
with 34.8 percent of the vote, taking 62 seats in the 150-seat 
Parliament.

The senior party of the outgoing 
coalition, the Slovak Democratic and Christian Union, was well behind in
second, with 15.4 percent, or 28 seats.

Fico's party campaigned on a promise 
to maintain the country's welfare state even as other European countries
slash their budgets to deal with the economic crisis.

During his term of prime minister 
between 2006 and 2010, Slovakia adopted the euro currency in 2009.

Despite him taking the largest share of the vote in the 2010 election, 
four opposition parties with a majority of 79 parliamentary seats agreed
to form a ruling coalition.

Mr Fico and his party had always 
supported expanding the fund expansion in principle, but had said it 
would vote 'yes' only if the government agreed to call early elections.

As major eurozone policies need the 
approval of all 17 countries that use the currency, Slovakia's vote - 
the last - carried immense weight.

For
weeks it appeared certain it would reject boosting the bailout fund, 
unnerving financial markets and threatening the future of Europe's plans
to fight the crisis.

Experts
said EU officials could possibly find a way around a Slovakian 
rejection of the bill to boost the powers and size of the bailout fund, 
the European Financial Stability Facility (ESFS), but that doing so 
would carry costs to European unity.

In
the longer-term, the drama seems sure to add momentum to the push for 
nimbler rules to govern the 17-country eurozone, where government 
reaction to the unfolding crisis has seemed for many months to be behind
the curve.

That push has been gathering momentum for some time.

Charts key economic data for Greece

In August, the leaders of France and Germany, President Nicolas Sarkozy and Chancellor Angela Merkel, proposed that the heads of the eurozone countries elect the president of a new 'economic government' who would direct regular summits to respond to the continent's financial crisis.

And in September Jose Manuel Barroso. president of the European Commission, decried what he called 'the constraint of unanimity'.

Mr Barroso told the European Parliament: 'The pace of our joint endeavour cannot be dictated by the slowest.'

At issue now is an agreement reached by the eurozone leaders in July to enlarge the EFSF's capital guarantee from 440billion to 780billion euro. Slovakia would contribute about 1 per cent, or 7.7billion euro.

In addition, if the changes are approved, the facility would have new powers and able to prop up government bond markets and help put new capital reserves against losses in banks.

Although 16 countries have given the thumbs-up, approval of the changes has found itself in potential jeopardy because of the opposition of a junior member of Slovakia's governing coalition, the Freedom and Solidarity Party.

The party's chairman, Richard Sulik, had called the expanded bailout fund 'a road to hell' and vowed to block
