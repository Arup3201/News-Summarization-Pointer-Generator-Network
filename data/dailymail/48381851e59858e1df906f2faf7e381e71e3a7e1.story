ITV are preparing to go head-to-head with the BBC for the rights to Match of the Day as they consider a bid for the rights to Premier League highlights.

The broadcaster, which last held the rights for Premier League highlights between 2001-04,  is considering a bid to get them back with the BBC's current £60million per year deal set to expire at the end of next season.

The potential move adds a layer of intrigue to the Premier League rights bidding that is set to take place next year, with BT Sport looking to further threaten Sky Sports stranglehold on the live broadcasting of matches.

Any potential ITV bid comes off the back of a difficult time for the broadcaster, who lost their live Champions League coverage after BT Sport spent £897million for exclusive rights from next season, and their live FA Cup rights to the BBC this year.

Last time ITV held Premier League highlights rights, they signed Des Lynam from the BBC to host and attempted to switch the show from its regular late night slot on a  to Saturday prime time - but with little success.

ITV have declined to comment on whether they are set to launch such a bid, but it is likely that any highlights show would be hosted by Adrian Chiles and feature regular pundits such as Lee Dixon and Andy Townsend.

Chiles used to host Match of the Day 2 on the BBC until his switch to ITV ahead of the 2010 World Cup.

The highlights show is currently celebrating its 50th anniversary on the BBC this season

In an interview with the Guardian earlier this month, the BBC's head of TV sport Philip Bernie spoke in praise of Match of the Day, which is celebrating its 50th anniversary this year.

'It has bucked the trend. But it is a unique proposition,' explained Bernie. 'People can get the clips they want to, they can watch Football First if they want to, they can watch the 12.45pm match on a Saturday and yet they still come to Match of the Day because it’s a great digest and it’s different to all those other things.'
