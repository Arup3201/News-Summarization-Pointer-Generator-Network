Raheem Sterling has been used as a No 10 by England but Rodgers put him on the wing against Basle where he made his name.

You can't blame Rodgers, for all Sterling's talent he hadn't scored in his last 19 games for club and country, hardly convincing evidence he deserves a more central role. 

Sterling, who turned 20 on Monday, has lost a bit of confidence and earned groans from the Kop after a poor touch ended a swift break.

There were as many Rafa Benitez signings in Liverpool's starting line-up  as those by current boss Brendan Rodgers. 

Benitez, who took the club to two Champions League finals, bought Glen Johnson, Martin Skrtel, Raheem Sterling and Lucas; the Rodgers quartet were Simon Mignolet, Dejan Lovren, Joe Allen Rickie Lambert. 

The remaining three starters were Jordan Henderson and Jose Enrique, both signed by Kenny Dalglish, and homegrown Steven Gerrard.

It was a typically passionate Champions goal celebration at Anfield - from the away end. 

Basle fans have a reputation for being the only ones in Switzerland who 'get football' like we do and Fabian Frei's excellent 25th minute strike was greeted with noise, colour and even a smoke bomb to add to the atmosphere. 

Their non-stop chanting was in contrast to the Kop who were strangely quick to turn on their side in a disappointing first half.

Basle manager Paulo Sousa has the dubious distinction of being sacked by two Championship clubs and leaving a third by mutual consent. 

But maybe the 44-year-old former QPR, Swansea and Leicester manager has found his right level in the Champions League. 

The Portuguese  also has an 'English' lucky charm - goalscorer Frei has now netted at Old Trafford, White Hart Lane and Anfield.
