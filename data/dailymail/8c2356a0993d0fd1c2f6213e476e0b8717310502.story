A groom who married the mother of his children on Christmas day in California very nearly didn't have a wedding at all after an accident left him comatose for two months.Just six months ago, a wedding seemed impossible for Thomas Jeglum, who fell 50 feet while working in June this year, suffering extensive injuries.His new wife Regina Jeglum says their marriage is a Christmas miracle after doctors told her that only 10 per cent of people wake up after suffering injuries like Jeglum's.

Special day: Regina and Thomas Jeglum decided to marry on Christmas day after he came out of a months-long coma

Dangerous job: Jeglum fell from a telecommunications tower while performing maintenance work on it

Jeglum is a telecommunications tower climber.

The Occupational Health and Safety Administration rates his as 'the most dangerous job in America,' and ranks it as more deadly than logging and fishing.

Workers climb hundreds of feet to replace antennas and do general maintenence on telecommunications towers.

As cell phone networks expand, tower climbers are in high demand. At least 10 tower climbers have died this year from falls while on the job.

Jeglum, 24, had been climbing towers for six weeks when he fell while working on an AT&T job in Allentown, Pennsylvania.

Family man: Jeglum with his two children who were almost left fatherless by his terrifying fall

Close call: Doctors say people with injuries like the ones Jeglum sustained often do not awaken from their comas

He had received training through his employer, Jacobs Engineering Group Inc., but 'he should have never been on any tower,' Regina Jeglum told the Wall Street Journal in August.

Jeglum fell after he attached his harness to a part of the tower that couldn't support his weight.

Tommy Jeglum is able to sit up, eat and speak to his wife and two children.

'Now he is awake and getting better every day,' Regina told FOX40. 'Itâ€™s amazing, our children have their daddy to hold him kiss him.'

Newlyweds: Tommy Jeglum is now at home with his family and improving day by day

The couple decided to get married on Christmas day after Tommy Jeglum's condition improved dramatically.

Regina Jeglum says having her husband home and getting married would not have been possible without the support of friends and family and the Hubble Foundation.

The Hubble Foundation is an organization dedicated to helping tower climbersâ€™ families after their loved ones suffer injury or death while on the job.

'People can argue facts and figures, but the dangers we are exposed to every day are real,' Bryce Mallory, another tower climber, told Fox 40.
