The best friend of a teenage boy, whose hilarious 'cat and lasers' yearbook photo was shared around the world, has spoken of her devastation following his suicide.

Draven Rodriguez, 17, took his own life at home in Schenectady, New York last Thursday, his family confirmed. 

His friend Mariah Cherie Szlachetka, 18, told Daily Mail Online on Monday that although Draven may be known around the world as 'laser-cat boy' thanks to the offbeat portrait he created, she will remember him as a talented, intelligent friend who always put others before himself.

Mariah, who is in her first year of college studying art, said she met Draven several years ago at the National Young Leaders State Conference.

She said: 'It was apparent from the start that he was intelligent far beyond others his age. He made friends so easily, not just there but everywhere he went.'

Despite living an hour away from each other in New York state, Mariah said that she and Draven talked often, sharing stories about their day, along with plenty of laughs.

'Many nights we sat up talking, helping one another work through the stress life brings,' she said.

'He attended my school's semi-formal my sophomore year as my date. Together, we attended the circus, went to the mall, saw movies, had sleepovers and went out to eat. 

'I attended as many of his school events, such as concerts and club functions, as possible.'

The pair dated for a short time but decided to be friends instead. Mariah said other dates she went on had to earn the 'Draven seal of approval'.

Mariah said that she was hardly surprised when the 'laser-cat' phenomenon exploded.

Draven's wacky portrait, posing in a suit while cuddling his cat Mr Bigglesworth in front of criss-crossing laser beams, became a wildly popular meme last year, earning mentions on Jimmy Fallon and Ellen De Generes talk shows. 

Last September, Draven dreamed up the wacky 'laser-cat' portrait to be used in his Schenectady High School yearbook.

At first, the school objected to Draven's request, so he started an online petition - which went global. 

The school relented and Draven's 'laser-cat' photo appeared on the school principal's page - and Principal Diane Wilkinson joining him in the shot with her chihuahua, Vivienne.

'I knew if he was going to be famous for anything someday, it would be for making people laugh,' Mariah told Daily Mail Online on Monday.

'I think that's how he wanted to be remembered, as someone who was able to make people smile.' 

The school principal Diane Wilkinson eventually relented to Draven's portrait - and even posed alongside him with her chihuahua Vivienne

The portraits  raised awareness for the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals and rescue animals.

Draven also volunteered with the How to UnMake a Bully program, according to the Daily News, and Mariah had earlier posted on Facebook that Draven had 'been struggling for a long time'.  

Mariah said on Monday that Draven's loss was devastating to everyone who ever knew him. 

'The world knows him as laser cat boy, but those that love him know him as a beautiful person, inside and out,' she said.

'We'll remember him as a talented, intelligent, quick-witted, well-rounded young man who always put others before himself. 

'He will be missed dearly, and I'm so far beyond grateful to have been a part of his life.'  

His stepfather, Jonathan Stewart, told The Times-Union this weekend that although they cherished Draven's sense of humor what made him so special was his ability to make friends wherever he went. 

'He had friends all over the country - people he'd met at youth-leadership conferences, online, just around town,' Mr Stewart added. 

Relatives and friends paid tribute to Draven's empathy, compassion and determination to complete anything he set his mind to.

The senior taught himself to play guitar, joining a rowing team and learned to speak basic Russian.

Draven is survived by his stepfather, his mother Melissa Petersen-Stewart, his 11-year-old sister Lily Stewart, and his father Eric Rodriguez. 

A private funeral service will be held on Friday in Colonie, New York.
