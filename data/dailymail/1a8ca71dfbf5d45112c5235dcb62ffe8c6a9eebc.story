She only popped out to the shops but Princess Beatrice still showcased some serious style credentials today.

The royal enjoyed lunch and a spot of shopping with her friends in Notting Hill, London, and looked bang-on-trend for the occasion.

The 26-year-old was barefaced for the afternoon and while she kept her outfit simple, she accessorised with a pair of £180 wedged trainers by Ash and a £1,235 Marcie tote by French fashion house, Chloe.

The fashion-forward Princess was seen perusing the clothes in Sloaney store Joseph, a firm favourite of the Duchess of Cambridge and Pippa Middleton.

After shopping, she enjoyed some lunch with her friends. Perhaps the young royal was looking for a last-minute birthday gift for her mother, Sarah Ferguson, who is celebrating her 55th birthday today.

Arm candy: Her £1,200 handbag is described on the website as 'timeless' and 'built to last'

Pit stop: After shopping, she enjoyed some lunch with her friends in West London, which has become her stomping ground

The family will no doubt be enjoying a celebratory dinner this evening seeing as youngest sister Princess Eugenie is back in town from New York.  

Last week, Princess Beatrice stepped out at London's Chiltern Firehouse for the book launch party for How Google Works, by Eric Schmidt and Jonathan Rosenberg.

The 26-year-old redhead wore a black semi-sheer collared minidress, which was cinched at the waist, showing off her slender frame and shapely legs.

Her boyfriend, Virgin Galactic executive Dave Clark, 31, attended the popular venue with her, looking dapper in a white button-down shirt under a black suit.

Beatrice, older sister of Princess Eugenie, 24, is also known to frequent A-list London favourites such as Zuma, Nobu, Restaurant C and Balthazar.

And as she continues to step out with her boyfriend, there's talk that he could soon be her husband.

The pair have been dating for over six years, and gossip is rife - denied by all concerned, naturally - that theirs might be the next royal engagement to be announced.

In the summer, Beatrice's mother Sarah Ferguson spent the weekend at Balmoral as a guest of Queen Elizabeth II.

She was accompanied by her ex-husband and their two daughters, leading some to speculate on the reasons for this royal rapprochement. 

Girl's day: Princess Beatrice may well be joining her mother for dinner this evening to celebrate Sarah's 55th birthday
