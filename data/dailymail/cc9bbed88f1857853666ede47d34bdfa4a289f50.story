Laid to rest: Little Emilie Parker, pictured, was laid to rest on Saturday as the last of the funerals for the 26 victims of the Sandy Hook school shooting were held

The heartbroken families of Emilie Parker, Ana Marquez-Greene and Josephine Gay laid to rest their little angels today as the last of the funerals were held for the 26 Sandy Hook shooting victims.

At a ceremony in Ogden, Utah, where her family lived before moving to Newtown, Emilie's family and friends remembered the six-year-old as they lowered a white child's size coffin into the ground.

Her father, Robbie Parker, described his little girl as someone who loved to make people smile and never missed a chance to draw a picture or make a card.

The outpouring of grief was overwhelming in the northern Utah city and volunteers tied ribbons around the town's trees, signs and utility poles in Emilie's favourite pink.

However, only close friends and family attended the funeral, that commenced at 10am, though it was broadcast live at a nearby chapel for the public.

On Thursday night, her relatives released 26 lanterns into the sky at a memorial service. Emilie's dad released the final lantern, a pink one, into the sky.

In a press conference, Parker teared up as said how the world was a better for having had Emilie in it.

'I'm so blessed to be her dad,' he said.

At a public memorial on Thursday, Parker said he felt the compassion from the public was coming from a 'pure place.'

'I want you to know as we saw all of 
the ribbons and all of the effort you put into that, it made me and 
Alissa really feel like we were getting a big hug from everybody,' he 
said.

Emilie was buried alongside her grandfather, who was killed in a bicycle accident a few months ago.

The heartbreaking event was held on 
the same day as fellow victims Josephine Gay, 7, and Ana Marquez-Greene,
6, were laid to rest, ending a tear-jerking procession of ceremonies.

Josephine's funeral mass was held at 
Saint Rose of Lima on Saturday morning. The first grader had just turned
seven the week of the shooting.

On Monday, purple balloons — Josephine's favorite color — were tied to the family mailbox and those of all her neighbours.

''Joey'
is a beautiful little girl, may she never be forgotten and live forever
in our hearts,' wrote Polly Larsen, a family friend, on Facebook, 
according to NBC.

Ana's funeral was held on Saturday morning at First Cathedral in Bloomfield, Connecticut.

'As much as she's needed here and missed by her mother, brother and me, Ana beat us all to paradise,'Ana's father, Jimmy Greene, wrote on Facebook.
