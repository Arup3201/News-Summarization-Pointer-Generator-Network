The repairman's colleague also suffered injuries but refused treatment 

An official at the scene told PIX 11 News that two workers were inside the elevator shaft at the time of the accident.

One of the repairmen was either inside or on top of the elevator car, while the other was underneath the elevator between the first and second floors.

At one point, the elevator moved, crushing the worker who was under the car.

The man's colleague also sustained injuries in the accident but refused medical attention.

Police told the New York Times the victim was employed by PS Marcato Elevator Company - a business based in the Long Island City section of Queens.
