A group of Tibetan monks are set to take the stage at Glastonbury next month after signing a global record deal.

The holy men have signed with Decca records, once the label of the Rolling Stones, and have performed on stages around the world for decades.

The Gyuto Monks, whose oldest member Lobsang Tsering, 78, was among 80 monks who fled Tibet with the Dalai Lama in the wake of the 1959 upheaval, is based in Dharamsala in northern India, home of the Tibetan spiritual leader.

Their Glastonbury performance coincides with the 100th anniversary of the Tibetan Declaration of Independence and will see them conducting a traditional ceremony in the Green Fields.

It will be their first performance in the UK since 1973 when they played Royal Albert Hall in London.

Over the years, the group hade graced New York's Carnegie Hall, Sydney Opera House and toured the US with rockers The Grateful Dead.

Their album, Chants: The Spirit Of Tibet, has been recorded at their monastery in the Himalayans by UK producer Youth who has previously worked with U2, Sir Paul McCartney and Depeche Mode.

He said: ‘Their voices are commanding and powerful. When they sing they put every fibre of themselves into to it. They believe that just by listening to these special tones you can actually come closer towards enlightenment.

‘To me they seemed like they were in the engine room of the world, diligently turning these huge invisible karmic wheels with their voices and mantras.’

The Gyuto Monks will break off from a tour of Australia with the Dalai Lama to make their appearance at Glastonbury Festival on June 27.

Thupten Phuntsok, of the Gyuto Monks, said: ‘We are honoured to be invited to take part in the world's premiere music and performing arts festival, at the spiritual centre of the site.’
