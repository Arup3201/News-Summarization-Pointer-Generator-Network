Taking a tip from her cousin-in-law the Duchess of Cambridge by showing that maternity wear need not be dowdy, the expectant Zara Phillips stepped out yesterday looking chic and elegant.

The Queen’s grand-daughter, who announced she is expecting her first child with husband, rugby star Mike Tindall, looked radiant in a flattering tunic dress featuring a graphic print and an interesting asymmetric sleeve.

Zara, 32, joined other members of the royal family, as well as the entire Middleton clan to watch a gala performance of music and dance from throughout the Queen's reign as part of the Coronation Festival, in her first public appearance since revealing she was pregnant.

The 32-year-old looked relaxed and radiant, keeping her make-up and accessories simple

The sleeved silk tunic dress featured a navy décolletage and a white panel with an intricate floral design on it.

The stylish loosing fitting choice, which fell to knee length, also served to conceal her growing bump from the world’s cameras.

Zara Phillips and Mike Tindall were on Centre Court to watch the men's singles final between Andy Murray and Novak Djokovic at Wimbledon last week

With her blonde hair lose round her shoulders, and simple make up Zara looked fresh faced and confident as she mingled at the event.

She kept accessories to a minimum with diamond studs in her ears, and just a silver watch and her wedding ring adorning her hands.

Fellow pregnant royal the Duchess of Cambridge has certainly set the bar high in terms of maternity fashion.

Kate has not set a foot wrong throughout her pregnancy, effortlessly mixing comfort with classic cuts and pretty floral colours.

The Duchess was not at the event last night, as she expected to give birth imminently, with her official due date being tomorrow.

Grandparents to be, Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall, were also present and accompanied the Queen who would normally have Prince Philip by her side. He is still recovering from abdominal surgery.

Each member of the royal box had a blue blanket on their seat in case of a drop in temperature at the event, which took place in the gardens of Buckingham Palace and is part of a series of events  to mark the 60th anniversary of the Queen's Coronation.

Grandparents-to-be Michael and Carole Middleton and their children Pippa and James were invited en masse by the Queen to join her in a royal box at Buckingham Palace.

Pippa chose to wear a white dress with a flower motif and lace top to the event, paired with nude court heels.

Looking happy and relaxed, they mingled confidently with members of the royal family watching a gala performance of music and dance from throughout the Queen's reign as part of the Coronation Festival.

Zara, who was part of the Olympic medal-winning British eventing team last summer, has come under fire for insisting she will carry on competing in top class horse trials despite her pregnancy.

During the gala last night a member of the Royal Warrant Holders Association even unveiled a figure of Zara Phillips riding her horse, Toytown, much to the obvious delight of the Queen.

Although the NHS advises pregnant women not to continue with ‘inherently risky’ sports such as horse riding, former world champion Miss Phillips was competing at the Barbury International Horse Trials at the weekend.

Miss Phillips, who is believed to be three months pregnant, came off her horse at one point, but was later described as ‘fine’.

A spokesman for Miss Phillips, as she is still known professionally, said she would carry on competing for several weeks at least. She is currently entered into three events later this month, with rides on six horses.

Catherine has mixed classic styles with pastel shades

With a royal arrival on the way and her 
pregnancy drawing to a close, it seems Kate can add 'maternity fashion 
ambassador' to her list of titles.

It may almost be time for the Duchess of Cambridge to hang up her pregnancy 
clothes, but her influence on maternity fashion is here to stay, 
according to a recent poll of over 500 UK mothers.

A massive 81 per cent of UK mothers have chosen Kate Middleton as the ‘best dressed pregnant celebrity’ over celebrities including Katie Price and Kim Kardashian.

The poll has revealed that the Duchess beat Katie Price (7 per cent), Kim Kardashian (6 per cent), Kate Winslet (4 per cent), Caprice (1 per cent) and Fergie (1 per cent) from the Black Eyed Peas to the title.

Over the past 9 months, mothers have fallen in love with Kate's chic style, from her pastel coloured dresses to her signature high heels. While dressing tastefully, Kate has remained youthful in three-quarter length sleeves and gowns slit to the thigh.

Kate is well-known for mixing couture with high street labels such as Topshop, LK Bennett, Reiss and Zara.

The down-to-earth Duchess has also been praised for recycling her outfits, such as the sell-out £38 Topshop dress she wore on a tour of the Harry Potter film studios and again to a friend's wedding.

The Duchess's demure 
style could not be more different from that of runners-up Katie Price 
and Kim Kardashian. Katie, who has hinted that she is expecting twins, 
recently showed off her bump in an outfit designed to look like a huge 
pair of lips, while Kim, whose baby is due this month, was recently 
snapped in a cut-out, cleavage-enhancing mini dress.

'We're not at all surprised that the Duchess won a landslide victory,' says Jas Uppal of RebelRebelClothing.co.uk who conducted the poll in partnership with Babies.co.uk.

'Ordinary mums are tired of seeing stars flaunt their pregnancy for the magazines and admire Kate’s classic elegance.'

So how can women achieve their winner's look at home?

'A Kate-inspired pastel coloured dress teamed with a smart black jacket and clutch is a great summer look and one that every mum can pull off,' recommends Jas.

According to James Macfarlane, Managing Director of Babies.co.uk, 'Kate Middleton's influence on our users has been far stronger than any other celebrity in living memory and I think mums will be referring to her as a style icon for at least the next twenty years.'
