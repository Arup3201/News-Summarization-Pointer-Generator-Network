Consider this photograph of federal agents celebrating after an astounding Christmas Eve cocaine seizure if you've ever wondered what more than $1 million of the drug looks likes when accumulated in a single place.  

The Coast Guard - along with other federal agencies - discovered the 86-pound cache divided into 31 packages and stowed within the bowels of the Godavari Spirit, a 900-foot crude-oil tanker - on Christmas Eve.

The siezure followed a tip from the tanker's crew, which alerted the feds to a suspicious package aboard their ship that hadn't been recorded on the vessel's manifest.

The boat was motoring 70 miles off the Texas coast in the Gulf of Mexico, when the crew notified authorities.

A joint boarding team consisting of the Coast Guard Investigative Service, Customs and Border Protection Office of Air and Marine, Homeland Security Investigations and the Drug Enforcement Administration reportedly - and quickly - followed up.

The packages are worth at an estimated $1,139,000, although The Bay Area Citizen reports the exact value of the cache depends on the quality of the drug.

Despite the seizure's size, it's not even close to the largest such one in history. That honor belongs to agents who siezed a staggering 21.4 tons of cocaine from a Los Angeles warehouse in 1989.

At the time, the DEA placed the value of the haul at $6 billion, and said it represented about 5 per cent of the world's total, annual cocaine production according to drugbustsworldwide.com.

Other notable seizures reportedly include the famous - and incredibly brazen - 2007 Coast Guard seizure of 42,000 pounds of cocaine aboard the Panamanian ship, Gatun, which the website pegs as the largest maritime cocaine bust in U.S. history.

In that instance, Coast Guard officials who spotted the ship in 2007 were shocked to find cocaine-filled packages piled on the deck with no attempt to hide the illicit booty.
