Accused: Tom Corea is accused of causing the damage after being evicted from his office on Farrington Street, Dallas, after failing to pay the rent

A disbarred Dallas lawyer has been ordered back to jail after allegedly smashing up his office and drawing penises all over the walls.

Tom Corea is accused of causing the damage after being evicted from his office on Farrington Street, Dallas, last month after failing to pay the rent, a criminal district court heard.

Doug Molny, president of the real estate company that represents the building, said he found 'complete destruction' and 'penis graffiti on every single wall,' when he had gone to check on the building.

Mr Molny's name had been daubed next to some of the penises. It also appeared that a sledgehammer had been taken to the granite counters.

Cabinets, doors, light fittings and appliances had been destroyed or removed.Mr Molny said he had also found feces and urine on the floor, Dallas News reported.

Prosecutor Jacob Harris showed the court photos 
of the damage, including an offensive message directed at an 
Arizona judge who found Corea in contempt of court in an unrelated case.

The message featured the judgeâ€™s name and a telephone number with a 505 area
code.

Earlier this year Corea was charged with 
four felonies alleging he stole from clients. He was then released on bond.

Now district judge Mike Snipes has set Corea's bond to 
$500,000 in each of the four felony cases.

Wearing a dark suit Corea, who did not testify, was ordered to 'refrain from making faces at the 
witness' during Mr Molny's testimony.

Corea's girlfriend's testimony was cut short after prosecutors accused her of being an accomplice.

The damage to the building it thought to be in excess of $100,000, Mr Harris told the court.

Setting the new bonds, Judge Snipes said: 'I doubt 
seriously there are any random vagrants in the Dallas area that are 
familiar with area code 505.'
