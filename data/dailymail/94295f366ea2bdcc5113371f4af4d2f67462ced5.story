In Korea eating dog is not frowned upon as it is in the United States and is even considered a delicacy, a practice that thanks to animal advocacy groups this is on the decline.

Last month Humane Society International (HSI) rescued 23 pups from Korea whose fate would have otherwise been someone's dinner.

Buzzfeed reports that the lucky dogs arrived at Washington D.C. shelters earlier this week and will begin a recovery process so that they can be placed in a loving home.

HSI has an ongoing initiative to eradicate the dog meat trade from Asia and convinced an owner of a puppy farm, Moon Suk Jung, to give up the dogs and stop running a dog farm.

The Huffington Post reports that they offered him $2,500 to start a blueberry farm instead.

He complied.

'Our objective is to have this be a permanent change in a cruel trade,' Kelly O’Meara of HSI told the Washington Post.

'[This farmer] is the first, and we’re hoping [he is] a model example for others to follow. Offering him some assistance -- that was something we were happy to do.'

Animal rights groups have highlighted that some of the 2 million or so dogs eaten in South Korea each year suffer painful and inhumane deaths.

Opposite views on dogs as either for eating or petting has co-existed in the country's recent history, feeding a controversy that becomes most bitter in the summer.

On three 'dog days,' which are among the hottest times of the year, many South Koreans queue for the dish of shredded dog meat and vegetables in hot red soup, believing it gives strength to bear the heat.

However the dog meat trade is on the decline and animal rights groups hope to deter people from eating and selling dog altogether.

They are ready and willing to provide alternatives to farmers like in the case of Moon Suk Jung.

They are also doing their best to rehabilitate dogs that were bred for the sole purpose of eating.

Fairfax County Animal Shelter in Virginia has offered to take in 10 not the dogs.

'Animal welfare issues exist throughout the world and in our own region and we’re always eager to assist whenever can,' shelter director Tawny Hammond told The Huffington Post.
