These are the dramatic pictures which show rescuers removing a huge boulder blocking a bridge after it was dislodged by a powerful earthquake this weekend.

At least 192 people were killed and left 23 missing following the 7.0 magnitude earthquake in southwest China shortly before 8am on Saturday morning.

More than 11,000 people were also injured in the earthquake, which has forced rescuers to battle to reach remote villages left stranded by the incident.

Rescuers were forced to blow up a boulder which was blocking a bridge after it was dislodged by the earthquake

The boulder was blocking a bridge on the way to the Baosheng township, in Lushan County, where the earthquake hit on Saturday morning

Rescuers were forced to blow up a huge boulder which had blocked a bridge leading to the Baosheng township, in Lushan County.

The earthquake toppled buildings, triggered landslides and disrupted phone and power connections in the region.

Many people were at home, sleeping or having breakfast, when it struck on Saturday.

Tens of thousands of people have been forced to move into tents or cars, unable or too afraid to return home as some 1,300 aftershocks continued to jolt the region following the initial earthquake.

The government has mobilised thousands of soldiers and others, sending excavators and other heavy machinery as well as tents, blankets and other emergency supplies.

The Chinese Red Cross said it had deployed relief teams with supplies of food, water, medicine and rescue equipment to the disaster areas.

Chinese Premier Li Keqiang arrived in Ya'an by helicopter on Saturday afternoon to direct rescue efforts.

'The current priority is to save lives,' Li said, after visiting hospitals and tents, and climbing onto a pile of rubble to view the devastation.

Lushan, where the quake struck, lies where the Sichuan plain meets the foothills which rise to the Tibetan plateau and sits on the Longmenshan fault.

Dozens of villagers escaped the Chinese earthquake because they were outside at a party celebrating the birth of a baby.

The 100-plus residents were in the central square when the 7 magnitude quake struck, saving them from being buried by collapsing buildings.

Che Wang held the party for her grandchild Lin in Taiping, only a few miles from the epicentre in Ya’an in southern China.

‘It meant we were all outside and safe instead of inside with the buildings collapsing on top of us,’ she said.

One resident added: ‘It’s a miracle that one new life should save so many others.’

Officials said three villagers died in the tremor, despite massive damage to buildings.
