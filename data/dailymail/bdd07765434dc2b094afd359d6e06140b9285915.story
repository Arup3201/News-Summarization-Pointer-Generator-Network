The tragic death of hit-and-run victim
 Karina Menzies is the second catastrophe for her family as her 
mother was strangled and killed in a row with a boyfriend eight years ago, it emerged today.

Sharon Menzies was just 45 when she died after a work romance with a married colleague turned sour in Ely, the same area of Cardiff where her child would later be brutally run down.

Her
 family say Karina 'went off the rails for a while' after the death of 
her mother - but was getting her life back together before she was murdered on Friday.

In a brave final act she threw her daughters out of the path of a white van which hit and killed her.

Matthew Tvrdon, 31, appeared in court today charged with her murder and 13 
counts of attempted murder after going on a devastating hit and run 
rampage in Cardiff.

A family friend said today: 'How could tragedy strike twice for a family like this? They are heartbroken.'

Karina,
 31, was left heartbroken - along with 
brother Craig, 32, Gareth, 26, Samantha, 24 and Laura, 21 -  after the death of her mother Sharon.

The
 friend said: 'It really hit them hard after their mother died. Karina 
mixed with some of the wrong people, got into drugs and got into 
trouble.

'But she was determined to get back on track for the sake of her kids. She was doing so well and now she is gone.'

Security
 guard Brian James, 63, left his wife to move in with Sharon Menzies, 
45, after a romance at the YMCA in Cardiff where both worked in 2004.

But after six weeks the relationship turned sour and Mrs Menzies asked him to leave her house.

Cardiff Crown Court heard James tried to make amends with wife Carol - but she too refused to have him back.

James then went back to Mrs Menzies and grabbed her by the neck during a bitter row.

Judge Gerard Elias said: 'You were upset that Mrs Menzies seemed indifferent to your problems.

'She was not being sympathetic.'

'Your reaction was that this was 42 years of marriage down the drain.'

Cardiff Crown Court heard that James had gone back to Mrs Menziesâ€™ home to collect his mobile phone.

The couple argued and James grabbed her briefly by the neck.

Judge
 Elias said: 'It was an attack of a relatively minor kind, but it was 
enough to bring about her death in hospital some three days later.'

The court heard James was a guard at a YMCA in Cardiff where mother-of-five Mrs Menzies worked as a cleaner.

John
 Charles Rees, defending, said: 'James will never be able to remove the 
fact from his mind that he unlawfully killed the woman that he loved.'

James, who was living with Mrs Menzies in Ely, Cardiff, denied murder but admitted manslaughter.He was jailed for 21 months.

Judge Elias added: 'You have shown real and genuine remorse at all times since this devastating action.'
