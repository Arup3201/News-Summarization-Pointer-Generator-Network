A fairytale wedding is a popular dream – but one US couple is making it a reality, by restoring a castle to use as a venue.

Daniel Edwards and Ebony Burnside, from Kansas City, want to transform the city’s dilapidated 1897 former jail - the Workhouse Castle - into a stunning environment to hold their June 8 ceremony.

The total cost will be somewhere in the region of three to four million dollars, so to help raise funds for the project, the pair are turning to crowd-sourcing and asking for donations through the non-profit 2orMore organization that Mr Edwards runs.

Clean-up: Volunteers from Mr Edwards' community youth organization have begun to rid the castle of graffiti and trash

Its aim is to encourage 20 to 30 year-olds to tackle community projects.

At the moment the castle is in the clean-up stage, with Mr Edwards’ using his 2orMore volunteers to rid the structure of graffiti and trash.

So far they’ve raised $12,000. Once they’ve garnered enough money they hope to build a community garden and an internet café at the castle.

Mr Edwards, an architectural engineer, explained that he was keen to use the wedding as an opportunity to give something back to the community.

He told The Kansas City Star: ‘I’m not really big on weddings. I asked her [Ms Burnside] “Can we reinvest into the community instead of giving our money to some established venue?”’

The idea to use the castle came to them as they drove around the city looking for venues, after Mr Edwards had proposed.

Ms Burnside said she had no idea that the castle even existed.

‘This castle here made sense, given that our wedding theme is legendary,’ Ms Burnside said.
