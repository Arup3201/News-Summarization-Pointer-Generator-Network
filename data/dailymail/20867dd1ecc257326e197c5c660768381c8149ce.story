A stolen Jack Russell missing for four years has been reunited with her owner after Sir Bruce Forsyth's campaign stepped in to help.

Jackie Barozzi's dog, Biba, was stolen from her Berkshire home in July 2009, soon after having puppies.

In August this year, Biba was found hundreds of miles away in Salford, Manchester, living with a new family who were unwilling to give her back.

So Jackie enlisted the help of Sir Bruce's daughter, Debbie Matthews, to fight her case and the pair have now been reunited.

Unbeknownst to Jackie, Biba had been adopted by a new owner in Salford and in August she went missing from her new home.

The dog was picked up by a warden who got in touch to say eight-year-old Biba had been found and identified as Jackie's pet by her microchip.

However Jackie's joy soon turned to despair when her pup was returned to someone else who proved they owned her with photographs.

Thames Valley Police had asked Manchester officers to seize her.

However,
an officer from Greater Manchester Police visited Biba’s new home - 
where she was known as Lucky - and decided she was well cared for and 
happy.

Incredibly, Biba wandered off for a second time within a month and this time Manchester City Council’s warden picked her up.

Once again Jackie was contacted and for a second time the erstwhile owner tried to claim Biba back.

This time Debbie Matthews, Sir Bruce’s eldest daughter, quick-stepped in to end the agony.

Her campaign, Vets Get Scanning, aims to reunite stolen and lost dogs with their owners.

In a strongly worded email to the council she pointed out that Biba was ‘stolen goods’, backing up her claim with a crime number from Thames Valley Police.

Debbie also told them that Biba had twice been found wandering without a collar, contrary to the law.

The dog warden quickly decided Jackie was the dog’s rightful owner.

She set up the Vets Get Scanning appeal after her Yorkshire Terriers were stolen from her car in May 2006. Although she was reunited with them within a week she was horrified to discover that many vets did not scan animals to find out if they already had owners

Divorced mother-of-four Jackie said: ‘I 
don’t know what I would have done without Debbie. Thanks to her, I have 
my dog back safe and sound.’

Debbie said: ‘Justice at last has been done, albeit in a roundabout way.

'But
we need to make sure that returning a lost dog to its owner via 
microchip is standard operational procedure for councils, rescues and 
vets.’

Debbie, 58, added: ‘At some stage the new owners would have taken Biba to the vet. If she had been routinely scanned it would have saved everybody heartbreak.

'We all think scanning is happening after having our dogs microchipped and it is not.’

Jackie had been bracing herself for court action before Debbie and the Sir Bruce-backed appeal weighed in.

Debbie
explained: ‘Why should you have to wait for seven days to get your dog 
back in case another owner comes forward when your data is in the 
microchip?’

Debbie, who has confirmed her father is feeling much better, began campaigning seven years ago after Yorkshire terriers, Gizmo and Widget, were stolen from her car while she was shopping in Camberley, Surrey.

Although she was reunited with them within a week she was horrified to discover that many vets did not scan animals to find out if they already had owners.

Waiting: Biba had been picked up by Manchester City Council's dog warden once before but given to a different person after they proved ownership with photographs. Jackie had been preparing for court action to get her dog back

An estimated 3,000 dogs are stolen each year and many are sold on to new owners.

By 2016 microchipping will be a legal requirement but Trevor Cooper, a solicitor specialising in dog law, confirmed that at the moment microchipping was not proof of ownership.

In cases where possession was disputed, a civil case before the small claims court would decide a dog’s future.

A judge would consider the merits of the microchip against other evidence, including who has cared for the dog and paid veterinary charges.

The court would then act in the best interests of the dog. The legal terms regarding micro-chipping in three years time had not yet been defined, he added.

The Vets Get Scanning campaign aims to get all vets to routinely scan dogs for microchips on their first visit.

This, they hope, will stop stolen dogs sold on to unsuspecting owners being lost forever.

With her father’s help, Debbie runs a busy national ‘lost and found’ Facebook page that backs microchipping and highlights its importance.

She also speaks publicly about the issue.

Sir Bruce, who has lent his name to her campaign along with a host of other celebrities, is a lifelong dog fan.

‘He is 100 per cent behind this,’ said Debbie.

Debbie said two Jack Russells taken from a neighbour’s home at the same time as Biba have still not been found.
