Four-year-old Ethan Stewart is at risk of dying from a seizure every time he falls asleep, gets excited or is bored.

Since his birth he has suffered thousands of epileptic fits because he was born with a unique combination of rare neurological conditions.

Even the delight at hearing the doorbell ring is enough to cause the youngster to black out and lose all control. 

Fragile: For young Ethan Stewart from Scotland, the things that make childhood fun are what put his life at risk

His parents Erica and Philip must keep a close eye on him constantly, as he is susceptible to a fit at any time.

Ethan suffers three separate neurological conditions. He has Sturge-Weber malformation that causes epilepsy and increases the risk of stroke. It affects only around one in every 50,000 babies.

He also has widespread intercranial haemangioma, a rolling ball of blood vessels in his skull, as well as an abnormal collection of blood vessels under his skin, which are visible as a blue mark on his face and forehead.

And, if that wasn't enough, he also suffers with cortical dysphasia, an abnormality in the brain’s development, which causes the electrical signals to misfire, which also triggers seizures.

The combination of these diseases means that the youngster suffers from frequent seizures, which vary dramatically in severity and length. Most last for just a few seconds but some can go on for several minutes.

The seizures occur throughout the day and night. The most serious of which leaves his mother unable to rouse him from his sleep.

Doctors mistook the blue veins on Ethan's forehead for a bruise immediately after his birth

Little did doctors know that Ethan suffered a unique combination of three different neurological disorders

It first became apparent there was 
something seriously wrong with Ethan shortly after he was born at 
Aberdeen Maternity Hospital.

He had to be resuscitated as he stopped breathing when the umbilical cord became wrapped around his neck during labour.

Ethan, weighing just 5lb 1oz, was 
then taken to the neonatal unit, where staff originally thought bruising
on his head was caused by the forceps used to deliver him.

But they soon realised it was more serious and scans showed his brain had developed abnormally.

Genetic testing and MRI scans were then carried out, before doctors confirmed his unique diagnosis.

Mrs Stewart said: ‘The wind dropped out of our world. It seemed so unreal.‘

‘His
MRI scan just looked like a mishmash of blood vessels. The neurologist 
calls him a walking miracle because he can’t believe the way he is now 
and the way his brain scan was.’

Ethan has a weakness down his right side and he is slightly smaller than average for his age.

Mrs Stewart, 34, from Mosstodloch, Moray, said: ‘Ethan’s had thousands of seizures. I try to keep a diary of them.

‘In the last month he has had about 100, but he’s probably had more than that, because sometimes they’re so quick, I can’t catch them all.

‘The slightest thing can trigger it, excitement, boredom, exhaustion. He gets excited when his friends come over or when someone arrives at the door and the bell rings. It’s very difficult. But his condition is just part of life now.

‘Sometimes at night you think, “what if?”. It’s always at the back of your mind that something awful could happen but you can’t allow yourself to live in fear.

‘You’ve got to enjoy one day at a time and not let it steal your life.

‘My biggest fear is Ethan not being socially accepted because of his condition rather than him dying.’

On a good day Ethan might only suffer two or three seizures, but most days he suffers up to 10.

But Ethan, who is hoping to start mainstream school this summer, has astounded everyone with his incredible resilience and determination.

'Medical miracle': Doctors thought Ethan would struggle in life but he is astonishingly spritely and able

Doctors have hailed him a ‘walking miracle’. Indeed  despite suffering from multiple seizures every day, he enjoys life like any other happy-go-lucky toddler, and loves nothing more than going to nursery and kicking a football around the garden.

Mrs Stewart said: ‘Ethan does get frustrated sometimes because he is tired a lot of the time. Fitting exhausts him. But he just takes it all in his stride.’

During many of his milder seizures, Ethan can appear to be daydreaming. Other times his muscles will go weak and he’ll fall to the ground.

Some cause him to run about, smack his lips, and mumble incoherently, though he is unconscious at the time and is completely unaware of his actions.

Other seizures make him feel scared or he’ll get a strange feeling in his stomach.

He can also suffer from the more serious tonic-clonic seizures, which can be life-threatening.

Mrs Stewart said: ‘There is a misconception about epilepsy that you lie down and have a fit. But Ethan’s are all quite different.

Bright future: Ethan now takes medication to help control his symptoms

‘Some of the seizures can just look like naughty behaviour. But his eyes will be away in the back of his head and if I click my fingers in front of his face, he won’t respond.

With complex partial seizures he starts mumbling incoherently and runs about all over the place. It looks like he is awake but he’s not.

‘I’ve got to monitor him in the bath and watch he doesn’t climb up high.

‘There was one time, when we went swimming, Ethan became excited and had seizure after seizure. If I hadn’t had a hold of him he would have been under the water.

Ethan is a determined young chap who is looking forward to starting school

‘If he’s not conscious the worst thing is trying to restrain him. You just have to make sure he’s safe and that he doesn’t bump into things or run out into the road.’

Sometimes Ethan is able to warn her when a seizure is about to happen because he gets a strange smell, known as an aura, or his face will turn red. Many, however, are so brief that when he was younger it was not always obvious when he was having one.

Because of this, Ethan was not formally diagnosed with focal epilepsy, where the excessive electrical activity that causes the seizure is concentrated on one part of the brain, until last September. He is now on anti-convulsion medication to try and control the number of seizures he has

Mrs Stewart, hopes the drugs Ethan is now on will have a greater effect over time.

But Mrs Stewart said: “He is very bright. “They [the doctors] didn’t think he would do very much and would struggle with everything.

‘But from the moment he was born, I have been praying for that child. I feel so blessed to have him in my life.

‘He is such a character and he is so strong and very confident in himself. 

‘He really is the sort of person who just gets on with it. We are so proud of him.’

Mrs Stewart is now trying to raise awareness of Epilepsy Scotland, which has helped her cope with Ethan’s seizures.

She has already raised more than £1,200 for the charity, after dying her hair purple last month.
