'Lost it': Stefan Martens attacked his father with a hammer and saw after going berserk at the house they shared in Lancashire

A depressed son battered his 97-year-old former Spitfire pilot father with a hammer then hacked at his throat with a saw after snapping under the pressure of caring for him.

Stefan Martens, 58, who had recently lost his job as a council binman and twice attempted to kill himself - went berserk after breakfast before calling police to say: 'I think I've just killed my father'.

Despite suffering a cardiac arrest and multiple injuries including a 4cm gash on his neck - Janek Martens survived and later told a court: 'I don't think Stefan should be punished - what happened was a pure accident.' 

Preston Crown Court heard how Martens - described as a 'gentle giant' - had proudly devoted 20 years of his life to looking after his father having moved in following the death of his mother.

But the burden had begun to take its toll on him and he was also suffering from severe depression.

The pair had just eaten breakfast together on March 30 last year when Martens attacked his father with the hammer and the saw at the seaside semi-detached house they shared in St Annes, near Blackpool, Lancashire.

During the 8am assault Mr Martens snr was struck around six times with the hammer before his son cut his throat with the saw. 

Police were called to the horrific scene after Martens ceased his attack and rang 999 announcing: 'I think I have just killed my father. 

'I just lost it this morning and attacked him. He's a bit of a mess - I think he's dead.'

Paramedics found the Mr Martens snr lying on the dining room floor, with blood all over his face, head and arms. 

He had a 4cm gash on his neck, an arm injury and also had a fracture to the cartilage of his voice box.

The pensioner was airlifted to hospital in a critical condition but despite suffering a cardiac arrest and having to be revived several times, he made a recovery and is now in a care home. 

Mr Martens snr said later: 'I don't think Stefan should be punished at all. What happened was a pure accident. I love Stefan and I always will. I don't want him to go to prison.'

At Preston Crown Court, Martens denied attempted murder but was convicted after a trial and jailed for 14 years.

Family, friends and neighbours said there was a 'close bond' between the pair but in the past few years Mr Martens snr had become very dependent on him.

The level of care Martens was having to provide to his father, who flew a Spitfire in Second World War, got on top of him and he had no other interests or hobbies.

For 32 years Martens worked as a refuse collector for Fylde Council but was medically discharged after suffering back problems.

His own health began to deteriorate and he was diagnosed with depression.

He underwent a course of cognitive behavioural therapy but ended up harbouring suicidal thoughts and tried to kill himself with an overdose before later making another attempt on his own life. 

Martens told the hearing: 'My intention was to cause him some harm. I'm not proud to say it. I have not come up with a proper conclusion why I did it.

'I don't think I ever will. If only I could turn the clock back to that day.'

He added: 'It felt like it wasn't me who was doing it. I have never done a thing like that in my life and never will again. 

'I remember him saying "stop it, I'm your father, I'm your father". 

'I thought what am I doing? And I phoned the police. I felt like I had done him some serious damage, some serious harm. But it was never my intention to kill my own father.'

Mr Martens snr declined to make a statement to police and did not support the prosecution, telling officers he could remember 'nothing' of the incident. 

He even gave a testimonial which summed up his son as 'an honest straight forward chap who tells the truth'.

Martens has been at Guild Lodge mental health hospital since his arrest and will continue undergoing treatment in a psychiatric unit in Preston (above)

In his 999 call Martens said: 'Mental health team were round a couple of days ago. I have been feeling suicidal'. He also said he had been feeling 'homicidal'.

Mr Francis McEntee prosecuting told the court on the night before the attack, Martens had been seen making his way home at about 7pm and seemed a bit unsteady on his feet. 

The following morning, a neighbour heard a dull thudding noise from the address, at about 8am. There were a number of repeated thuds which went on for around five seconds.

Mr McIntee said: 'The prosecution case quite plainly is the defendant tried to kill his father and we say he clearly believed he had done so. He accepted causing his injuries and that he intended to cause him really serious harm.

Martens, who has been at Guild Lodge mental health hospital since his arrest, will continue undergoing treatment in a psychiatric unit under the Mental Health Act as part of his sentence.

Today Detective Sergeant Nick Denman, of Lancashire Police said: 'This was a tragic case where an elderly man has been subjected to a savage attack by his own son - to try to comprehend and come to terms with that must be extremely difficult for both Janek and the wider family.

'Hopefully the conclusion of this sad case will at least offer the opportunity to the Martens family to try to move on with their lives.'
