Millions of people - including pensioners and former Armed Services personnel - could find themselves with a backdated tax bill because of errors by HMRC.

Unsuspecting taxpayers with more than one income could be landed with a bill of up to £2,000 because HMRC offices are failing to share information on a central database.

The people most likely to be affected are couples with two pensions, those who continue to work part-time when they retire and former armed services personnel who now have civilian jobs, but still draw an army pension.

People could be hit with an extra tax bill after local HMRC offices failed to share their information on a central database

The problems have been caused by people's personal allowance - which means all earnings up to £10,000 are tax free - have been allocated more than once.

Often the mistake is only found a year later, when a bill for the unpaid tax is sent. 

People are being warned to take a close look at their tax returns, due to be submitted by January 31, to ensure no mistake has been made - especially as up to three million people are thought to have multiple incomes. 

Clive Stevens, the executive chairman of accountancy practice Reeves,described the error rate as 'high'.

Mr Stevens, who also sits on the council of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, told The Telegraph:  'Often when people have two sources of income, two tax codes are issued by separate HMRC offices, each acting on the basis of information given to them by an employer, pension provider or the taxpayer directly.

'Clerical errors are made because the workforce, which has suffered sweeping redundancies, is demoralised and the required attention to detail and care is not there.

'In my experience, up to three out of five PAYE codes that we see in our office are incorrect when first issued. 

'In the worst cases, it has taken 10 attempts to get a correct code from HMRC.'

But an HMRC spokesman said more than 98 per cent of its tax codes are right, with the cast majority of people paying their tax correctly from the outset and throughout the year.  

The spokesman added: 'The introduction of our new computer system mean that these kinds of very old underpayment cases would not happen now. 

'We introduced the National PAYE Service in July 2009 which merged 12 regional databases into one national system which means that any HMRC office can respond to our customer's enquiries.

'The idea that millions of people will get taxed is just completely wrong.'
