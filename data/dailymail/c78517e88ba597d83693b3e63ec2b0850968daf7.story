Laura Whitmore knows how to work a red carpet - which is why she was the perfect person to present coverage from the 'black carpet' at the MTV Europe VMAs on Sunday.

The 28-year-old Irish presenter is always perfectly groomed, fabulously attired and oozing self-assurance.

However, speaking in Irish Stellar magazine, she said: 'I don't think any woman is 100 per cent confident in her own skin. When you get older though, it's about 
learning what does and doesn't work for you, style-wise.'

Rising star: Laura Whitmore is fast becoming a staple on the showbiz scene and now she's opened up to Stellar magazine about body confidence

'I think that's 
the difference between me now and when I was 18. Back then, I probably 
had a better body than I do now, but I hated it because I was so 
self-conscious. All I ever wore was baggy pants.

'I think I'm more body-wise than 
body-confident now. I feel at my sexiest when I'm wearing a great dress 
that I feel comfortable in. There's nothing worse than wearing a 
gorgeous dress you can't breathe in.'

Laura had to 
jet off straight to Australia after fronting her segment of the MTV awards 
last night to prepare for her next job presenting on I'm A Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here! NOW!.

How things have changed: Laura says that when she was 18 she 'probably had a better body than I do now, but I hated it because I was so self-conscious. All I ever wore was baggy pants'

Stellar career: In 2011 she replaced Caroline Flack on ITV2's I'm a Celebrity Get Me Out of Here! NOW! and hosted the BRIT Awards alongside Keith Lemon in 2012

She describes her career - which started in  2008 when she was chosen as the winner of MTV's Pick Me MTV, a presenter search and has gone from strength to strength since - as a 'crazy rollercoaster'.Â 

In 2011 she replaced Caroline Flack 
on ITV2's I'm a Celebrity Get Me Out of Here! NOW! and hosted the BRIT 
Awards alongside Keith Lemon in 2012.

On
top of her burgeoning TV career, Laura has designed her own clothing range in association with brand AWear, and is an 
ambassador for the Pond's Institute.

The 'hugely ambitious' TV star says she has lots of goals she has yet to accomplish.

The full interview appears in the December issue of Stellar, on sale 13th November
