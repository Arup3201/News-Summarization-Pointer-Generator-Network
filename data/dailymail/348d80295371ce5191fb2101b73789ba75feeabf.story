He is the comedian who puts his success down to his working class background.

Growing up on a 1960s council estate, says John Bishop, helped shape his sense of humour.

Now, however, he appears to have outgrown his humble roots. For home these days is a ten-bedroom mansion surrounded by 24 acres of landscaped lawns he purchased for £2.25million last year.

Despite being only a few miles from his childhood home in rural Cheshire, the impressive property boasts an inside swimming pool, tennis court and lake with an accompanying island.

All a far cry from the three-bedroom council property he grew up in.

His new family home is the result of his remarkable rise from circuit stand-up comedian to household star who has made millions of pounds through TV appearances, sold-out stadium tours and impressive DVD sales.

According to his company’s financial reports, Bishop, 47, and his wife Melanie are worth more than £5.5million, with the bulk of their fortune being made in the past two years.

Bishop’s autobiography How Did All This Happen? has also stormed the bestseller charts with more than 93,000 hardback copies sold since last year.

In the book the BBC star describes how he keeps his feet firmly on the ground with the help of a reminder of his less luxurious start in life: The street sign from where he grew up.

He describes how his brother Eddie ‘nicked’ the Severn Walk sign from the 1960s estate and presented it to him before a gig with the message: ‘So you don’t forget where you are from.’

Together: Bishop with his wife Melanie last year. The two briefly split but have reconciled

Bishop says the sign ‘now hangs in my kitchen, in pride of place’. He adds: ‘You can’t return to your childhood, but you don’t have to leave it, either.’

He moved to the end-terrace house in the 1960s while still a toddler after his family home in Liverpool, which his father bought off a friend in the pub for £50, was knocked down as part of a slum clearance scheme. He says playing football in the council estate is his earliest memory and has helped define him, along with his sense of humour.

Having made his success, Bishop adds he is keen to remain living in Cheshire and not make the move to London.

He said in a recent interview: ‘There are socialist elements ingrained in you if you’ve grown up on a council estate; it’s something I’m proud of. But I also don’t feel you should apologise for your success if you have managed to move on to good things.

‘I can’t see any reason to leave. It’s never crossed my mind. I think that if you live in the North of England you are a very, very lucky person. I can’t see myself in Primrose Hill drinking cappuccinos. This is where I belong.’ Bishop gave up his successful job as a pharmaceutical salesman to concentrate on comedy in 2006.

He briefly split from his wife Melanie, with whom he has three sons – Joe, 19, Luke, 17, and Daniel, 15 – before reconciling through counselling.

He found fame through the BBC’s Live At The Apollo series in 2009 before appearing in the BBC’s John Bishop’s Britain, John Bishop’s Big Year and the drama series Accused.

More than 300,000 people saw his last tour and his television audiences for his comedy shows have topped 6.5million.  

He also raised more than £3.4million for the BBC’s Sport Relief charity by carrying out a week-long triathlon as well as rowing the Channel and running from Dover to London.
