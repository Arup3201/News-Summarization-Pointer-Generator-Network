Real Madrid midfielder Sami Khedira has joined the list of casualties for Germany's 'World Cup final replay' against Argentina after tearing a muscle in his left thigh.

The injury was confirmed by team doctor Hans-Wilhelm Mueller-Wohlfahrt in Munich, the German football federation said on Tuesday.

Defenders Jerome Boateng of Bayern Munich and Mats Hummels of Dortmund also withdrew with injuries on Tuesday, while Arsenal midfielder Mesut Ozil was already ruled out of Wednesday's game with an ankle problem.

Germany coach Joachim Low had already called up Hoffenheim midfielder Sebastian Rudy for the friendly against Argentina on Wednesday because of 'a shortage in defensive midfield.'

Rudy, 24, made his debut in the 0-0 friendly draw with Poland on May 13 before the World Cup.

New captain Bastian Schweinsteiger has a lingering knee injury and Philipp Lahm, Miroslav Klose and Per Mertesacker have retired, meaning Germany will field a much-changed side to the one that beat Argentina in the World Cup final.

Germany begins its 2016 European Championship qualification campaign against Scotland in Dortmund on Sunday. Ozil was working to be fit for that game.
