A rogue trader has been fined nearly £700,000 by City watchdogs for trying to cash in on the Bank of England’s efforts to rescue the British economy.

Mark Stevenson, a former dealer at City bank Credit Suisse, attempted to exploit the Bank’s Quantitative Easing (QE) programme – which involves injecting newly-minted money into the economy to boost growth – for his own personal gain.

In a telephone conversation with another trader, he described the QE operation as ‘cake’, meaning an easy way to make profit.

‘We’ve been loading up with QE trades for months…..QE’s are cake,’ he said.

The errant dealer planned to sell his £1.2bn holding to the Bank, having driven it up to an artificially high price.

His actions that could have cheated taxpayers out of millions of pounds if it had subsequently had to be sold at a loss.

But he was thwarted within less than an hour of his attempts to rig the bond market when rivals reported his unusual trades to the authorites.

Stevenson, a seasoned dealer with nearly 30 years experience, was fined £662,700 by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA)  and banned from the industry.

His fine would have been £946,800 but he qualified for a 30pc discount by agreeing to settle at an early stage of the investigation.

The regulator said this was ‘the action of one trader on one day’ and that there was no evidence of collusion with traders at other banks.

But it is the latest in a line of market abuse scandals that have rocked the City.

Big banks have already been fined billions of pounds for rigging Libor interest rates and are under investigation for suspected manipulation of the foreign exchange markets. In an attempt to stamp out the wave of malpractice, the Bank appointed Minouche Shafik as the new deputy governor to police financial markets.

The FCA said Stevenson’s attempt to manipulate the gilt market was ‘particularly egregious.’ 

‘Stevenson’s abuse took advantage of a policy designed to boost the economy with no regard for the potential consequences for other market participants and ultimately for UK taxpayers. He has paid a heavy price for his actions,’ said Tracey McDermott, director of enforcement.

The fine is the first time regulators have taken action over malpractice in the market for ‘gilts’, which are IOUs issued by the UK government.

The Bank of England carries out its QE operations by buying up gilts from traders, pension funds and other investors. The cash paid to the sellers is injected into the economy, where it helps the flow of money to firms, which in turn stimulates growth.

Stevenson was attempting to cash in on the process by cornering the market in key gilts, in order to sell them to the Bank at a hefty gain.

He gradually accumulated a huge stake worth more than £500m between 1st July and 5 October 2011. On Thursday 6 October, the Bank announced it would start a fresh bout of QE on 10 October. Between 9am and 2.30pm on that day, Stevenson amassed another £331m of the gilts, accounting for more than 92pc of turnover that day.

He then offered to sell £850m of the gilts to the Bank, at a price that had been pushed higher by his own dealings.

Bank officials ‘identified the highly unusual price movement’ and declined to buy.

The FCA  declined to comment on how much profit Stevenson  could have made if his ruse had come off, but the figure is likely to have been in the millions. The profits would have accrued to his employer, Credit Suisse, but would have helped boost his bonus.

Credit Suisse said: ‘We agree with the FCA’s decision to sanction Mr Stevenson and are pleased to note that neither Credit Suisse nor any other employed individuals have been found at fault. The bank cooperated fully with the investigations into this matter by the Bank of England and Financial Conduct Authority.’  

Stevenson was employed by Credit Suisse from 2008 and was suspended in October 2012. He left the bank in December 2013. Prior to that, he worked at RBS.
