Claim: Jose Manuel Barroso claims that David Cameron's plans to renegotiate power from the EU is doomed

David Cameron’s plan to claw back powers from Brussels is ‘doomed to failure’, the president of the European Commission has claimed.

In a provocative intervention Jose Manuel Barroso rubbished Mr Cameron’s plan to renegotiate Britain’s relationship with Europe, saying it was ‘unreasonable’ to expect other member states to agree to fundamental changes.

The Prime Minister has staked his reputation on securing a new deal on Europe ahead of an in/out referendum in 2017.

Speaking at the Conservative Party conference this week he insisted that other countries were willing to consider Britain’s requests, including his demand that the historic EU aim of ‘ever-closer union’ is scrapped.

He said: ‘We’ve won allies to get powers back from Europe. That is what we will do. And at the end of it - yes - we will give the British people their say in a referendum.

'That is our pledge. It will be your choice - in or out.’

But, in a series of interviews in Brussels, Mr Barroso said the EU would never agree to fundamental change.

He said minor measures and red tape, such as a proposed ban on hairdressers wearing high heels, could be scrapped on a case-by-case basis.

Mr Barroso said there was no prospect of wholesale changes to the so-called ‘acquis’ - the 150,000 book of EU regulations.

He added: ‘There are two ways (of achieving change). One is the pragmatic, reasonable approach, seeing case by case whether legislation is needed or not.

‘The other one is to have a fundamental discussion about the competences (powers) of the EU, even in terms of renationalisation. I think the second approach is doomed to failure.’

Mr Barroso said there would be ‘others, many, who oppose’ Mr Cameron’s call for treaty change - and suggested British proposals would be vetoed.

‘Britain wants to again consider the option of opting out,’ he said. ‘Fine, let’s discuss it, but to put into question the whole acquis of Europe is not very reasonable.’

Tory MP Anne Main warned that Mr Barroso’s intervention would harden Eurosceptic views in Britain.

She said: ‘The view of parliament and, I think, the country is that if we can’t get a significant renegotiation then we may want to re-evaluate our membership of the EU.

‘Comments like this push us further down that road. If they won’t renegotiate and see the writing on the wall then they will leave us very few options.

‘As far as Mr Barroso is concerned I think the views of elected representatives should carry a great deal more weight than those of an unaccountable official.’

UK Independence Party leader Nigel Farage said Mr Barroso was right to warn that any attempt at fundamental renegotiation was doomed.

But the think tank Open Europe described Mr Barroso’s intervention as ‘sort of irrelevant’ - pointing out that his term of office expires next year, and that the negotiations will be carried out mainly by national leaders rather than the European Commission.
