A Halloween attraction featuring a section which sensationalises a simulated sex ordeal has been branded ‘degrading and humiliating’ by horrified rape charity bosses.

The Scare Kingdom Scream Park is marketed as a ‘top Halloween destination’ and  promises a ‘unique and seriously twisted journey’.

But this year, organisers have been accused of taking the ‘entertainment’ a step too far after adding a section which sees visitors strapped to a bed and a  cushion put on their faces, before a man climbs on top of them.

One visitor, to the site in Ribble Valley, 
Lancashire, was shocked to have a sex toy waved in her face before a bag was placed over her head.

However, organisers AtmosFEAR! Scare Entertainment stood by the ‘Psychomanteum’, which is separate to the main attraction, for over 18s only and requires an additional charge.

They said it was up to visitors whether they entered and they must sign a disclaimer before taking part, stating they know they will be manhandled, it will be sexually explicit and a bag may be put over them.

Jo Wood, a trustee at Rape Crisis, said: 'I am horrified. We would not support such a degrading, humiliating experience or class it as entertainment.

'I am absolutely horrified that anyone can find it okay to prey on a woman’s deepest vulnerability and fear in this way in the name of cheap thrills, for who exactly?

'I can only imagine the damage this 
would do to a recovering victim, a long ago victim - or any sane member 
of public to be honest.

'This
 is not about Halloween - or scares - it is about humiliation. It errs 
on the dark side of scary - the secret and hidden world of sexual abuse 
under the cover of ‘fun’ and ‘just a laugh’.'

Valerie Wise, chief executive of Preston Domestic Violence Service added: 'I think it is legitimising violence against people.

'The
 most common victims of personal violence are women. I think to make 
entertainment out of violence against people is horrendous.'

Psychomanteum is the only part of the
 Scare Kingdom, held at Hawkshaw Farm Park that people enter alone.

One horrified visitor to the Scare Kingdom attraction, who did not want to be named, has described her experience.

She says she was repeatedly sworn at and strapped down on a bed.

She said: 'It was an awful experience. It wasn't enjoyable at all and it certainly isn't entertainment.

'You enter on your own and walk into a dark room with a wheelchair in the middle. There's a woman who grabs you and shoves you down into the chair and then shouts at you to read the writing on the wall.

'I was then wheeled to the next room which had a toilet overflowing. I was told to kneel on a cushion with my head over the toilet and then the woman shouted and said "I've finished with you now".

'It was the next stage which I felt was just too far.

'There was a bed up against the wall and I was told to lie down. A man strapped me down and placed a cushion over my face.

'He then climbed on top of me and held the cushion down so I was really struggling to breathe.

'I couldn't see anything but I felt myself being wheeled through on the bed to another room. They must have untied me on the way.

'The cushion was removed and the man held a sex toy in my face and asked "do you want it in your mouth or your f****** a***".

'I was then chased out of the room with a man holding a chainsaw and you run straight into a bar.

'I was petrified but it meant I had to try and compose myself as quick as I could because there were people sat having a drink.'

'I couldn't believe it and it completely ruined the night,' the upset woman added, 'It was a real shame because the other sections were really good fun.

'There was a disclaimer on the wall before we went in which had some bullet points warning that it would be sexually explicit and you would be manhandled but I think my idea of explicit must be different to theirs.

'The disclaimer doesn't prepare you for the experience and I just wanted to go home after that. I was so shocked by what happened.'

The experience lasts about three minutes. It is separate to the main attraction and it requires an additional charge of £3.50. Those who enter are given a ‘safe word’ which enables them to cut short the experience.

It is the fifth year the festival has returned to the farm. In 2011, it was voted the ‘number one scream park.’

While visitors are in the room on their own, a live video feed of the activity is being streamed on a screen.

Jason Karl, chief creative executive of AtmosFEAR! Scare Entertainment, said: 'Psychomanteum is a strictly 18 plus attraction which is an additional feature of the park.

'It is up to guests whether or not to enter. Those who do enter have the content of the experience explained and sign a disclaimer saying they wish to experience it.

'Psychomanteum is set in a fictional Victorian correctional facility where fear is pushed to the limit with intense and graphic encounters which are designed to make the guest feel uncomfortable and scared.

'We have had many positive reviews and feedback from guests, none of whom have complained of being offended by their experience.

'Attractions of this nature have previously been operated in various scare entertainment parks all over the world.'
