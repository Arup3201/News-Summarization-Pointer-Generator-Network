Video footage of a Russian 'ghost car' has left viewers scratching their heads after apparently showing a vehicle appearing out of nowhere at a busy intersection.

The car nearly causes an accident as it suddenly appears in front of traffic turning left at traffic lights on a main road.

The dash cam footage, believed to have been filmed in Russia, was taken from a vehicle behind the BMW which nearly crashes into the black car.
