They might be known for working together in complex colonies, but woodland ants can be quite antisocial.

The insects are able to fire smelly acid into the air to ward off predators and now, their offensive behaviour has been caught on camera.

Woodland ants work together to jointly squirt foul-smelling liquid when they sense a threat overhead – such as a hungry bird.

Formica
 rufa - also known as woodland ants and horse ants - are native to 
Europe, Britain and North America in woodland and parkland.

Worker ants are red and brownish black and measure between 4.5mm and 9mm in length.

They can spray formic acid from their abdomens in defence, like many other species of ants.

Nests
 are often built against rotting wood in the sun and colonies can have 
between 100,000 and 400,000 workers plus 100 queens. At their largest 
they can measure several metres in height and diameter.

The creatures are aggressively territorial and attack and remove rival ant species in their patch.

Nuptial
 flights - an important phase in the reproduction of most ant, termite 
and some bee species - take place in the springtime and are often marked
 by fierce battles between neighbouring colonies.

Wood ants typically have multiple nests so they can move around in case of drastic changes in the environment.

The formic acid is not harmful to humans and has the same odour as vinegar.

However, it is enough to scare off larger predators such as woodpeckers and jay birds, who could wreak havoc on an ant nest.

Woodland ants live in the UK as well as other parts of Europe.

Their
 aggressive behaviour was captured by Paul Quagliana, 43, a wildlife 
photographer, who found a colony of the ants on a log in Wareham Forest,
 Dorset.

In order to 
trigger the insect’s reaction, he gave their nest a tap, which prompted 
the ants to squirt acid in the air from their tiny abdomens.

‘There are many different species of 
woodland ants in Britain and these are called Formica rufa,’ said Mr 
Quagliana, who lives in Gillingham, Dorset.

‘As a defence mechanism they squirt formic acid which smells a bit like salt and vinegar crisps or fish and chips,’ he explained.

‘If you put your hand an inch or two away from the nest they will squirt the acid to try and drive anything away.

‘It doesn't hurt but it stinks and I imagine if it was to get in your eyes it would probably sting.’

In
 order to capture the action, he set up his camera on a tripod, ensuring
 the sun was behind the ants, which had built a nest on a log.

‘I then tapped the log and lifted my hand up and started taking photographs,’ he said.

‘I didn't see it when they were squirting the acid but when I looked back at the images, the sun had captured the droplets.’

Formic acid is used as a preservative and antibacterial agent on animal food, tanning leather, dying textiles, and in the making of rubber.
