A Ukip MP has been mocked online after a message sent from his Twitter account invited his followers to 'Come Play Hello Kitty World with me'.

Douglas Carswell - the former Tory who defected to the Eurosceptic party - said he was in a 'serious conversation about some very dull Westminster thing' when he was alerted to the furore surrounding his Twitter post.

The message, posted earlier today, said 'Come Play Hello Kitty World with me. #hellokittyworld Kittt (sic),' and was accompanied by a picture of the online game.

The message, which was accompanied by a picture of the game, has been retweeted more than 1,000 times

Hello Kitty World is an online app which allows users to build an amusement park and features the popular Hello Kitty characters.

It is available on the App Store for free.

The bizarre Twitter post prompted a wave of satirical replies - several suggesting it was aimed at fellow MP Nigel Mills who was caught playing an online game during a Commons committee hearing.

It has since been shared more than 1,000 times, has been favourited 400 times and has attracted waves of comment.

However, Mr Carswell swiftly pinned the blame on his daughter, who is named Kitty and is a big fan of the game that bears her name.

He wrote: 'Oooops! That's the last time I leave the five year old in charge of the iPad (but it is a great game.'

He later added: 'My five year old's first tweet got read by many more than any of mine.'

The Clacton MP laughed off the fuss as 'one of the joys of being a dad' and the peril of allowing youngsters access to technology - insisting it had done no harm.

Unlike some posts sent in the past 'in a fit of pique' which he now regretted, he said, 'I hope this put a smile on people's faces'.

He insisted he had not actually played the game himself.

'I have managed to avoid that so far but she is a keen fan,' he said.

Dubbed the 'Hello Kippy' incident in Westminster today, some MPs used the incident to poke fun at Ukip policies.

'Hello Kitty World to have strict border controls under leadership of Douglas Carswell,' one Twitter user replied.

'Moshi Monsters to be incarcerated on Isle of Man.'
