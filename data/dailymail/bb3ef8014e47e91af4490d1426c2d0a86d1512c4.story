Normally all eyes on are on the politician's wives and their outfits during party conference season.

But Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg was in the spotlight today after bizarrely wearing not one, but four different outfits in a single day.

As he battled against claims the Lib Dems are indecisive and struggle commit to a course of action, he wore a suit for TV interviews, a smart casual outfit for a school visit and a black shirt and chinos for a Q&A session which looked more suited to the garden centre than the conference hall.

He then switched back to his blue suit before the day was out. 

Embarking on a media blitz this morning, Nick Clegg (left) wore a dark blue suit, blue shirt and pink tie for his interviews on Sky News. Then on a visit to Castlehill Primary School in Glasgow, Mr Clegg wore jeans and a pale blue shirt (centre), but by this afternoon he was in grey chinos and a black shirt (right)

Mr Clegg began the day with a media blitz of TV and radio interviews, appearing on BBC Radio Scotland, BBC Breakfast, 5Live, BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Sky News, Sky News Radio and ITV's Good Morning Britain.

In all of the interviews he wore a dark blue suit, light blue shirt and a pink tie, despite listeners to radio shows being unable to see him.

Barely an hour later he visited Castlehill Primary School in Bearsden, East Dunbartonshire, with his wife Miriam.

To speak to the schoolchildren, Mr Clegg wore dark jeans, a light blue shirt and brown suede shoes.

Aimed at promoting Lib Dem policies on childcare and school dinners, the couple tried their hand at making scones.

Returning to the SECC conference centre on the Clyde, Mr Clegg took questions from Lib Dem activists in the main hall.

But not before dipping into his wardrobe again, and pulling on a black shirt over a pair of light blue chinos.

There was much speculation that the Deputy Prime Minister was wearing jeans to address the party faithful, on what is a working day.

But aides were quick to stress: 'They are chinos not jeans.'

Earlier he teamed the ensemble with a brown sweater and bookish glasses while he waited for Vince Cable's keynote speech. 

The bizarre decision to dress down on a work day came as Mr Clegg warned his party they face the 'fight of our lives' to stay in power.

The Lib Dem leader admitted his party faces a tough battle to cling to office after the general election in May, but insisted he would set out red lines for entering a new coalition with either the Tories or Labour. 

Asked if he would rather get into bed with David Cameron or Ed Miliband in a new power-sharing deal, Mr Clegg joked 'it's Miriam every single time'.

No-one could quite understand why Mr Clegg chose to address delegates wearing a black shirt during a Q&A

According to a poll published tonight, most voters, 56 per cent, believe the Lib Dems have become irrelevant.

The ComRes survey for ITV News found just 26 per cent disagree. Just 14 per cent trust Mr Clegg to keep the promises he makes while 63 per cent believe the Lib Dem leader will break his pledges.

Some 44 per cent of adults believe it was a mistake for the party to go into Coalition with the Conservatives in 2010 and 42 per cent feel betrayed by Nick Clegg.

But ousting the Deputy Prime Minister and replacing him with a new leader would mean just 18 per cent are more likely to vote for the Liberal Democrats. 

Mr Clegg has come under pressure to spell out what his key demands would be before entering into a coalition with Labour or the Tories.

But in keeping with the Lib Dem reputation for indecision, he insisted he would decide - but not yet.

He said: 'Those are decisions and bridges, if you like, you can’t possibly cross until you hear what the bosses in all of this, the British people, have to say to us politicians in the ballot box at the next election.'

Mr Clegg struck a casual pose on the main stage, in contrast to David Cameron and Ed Miliband's more formal looks at their party gatherings

The Lib Dem leader added: 'I really do think that if either Labour or the Conservatives were to run this country on their own again, the country would go backwards. It would go backwards economically under Labour, it would go backwards socially under Conservatives.

'I'm really pleased that we are the party saying that there's a more hopeful, positive vision of the future built around a simple old-fashioned liberal concept, which is opportunity for everybody.'

A major split has opened up between the Tories and Lib Dems over how £25billion can be raised to eradicate the deficit after the election.

Last week Tory Chancellor George Osborne made clear it should come entirely from spending cuts, including £3billion from freezing benefits. 

But Mr Clegg has insisted some of the money should come from tax rises. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'Our overall approach is that we want to maintain roughly what we have done in this government, which is that the bulk of the savings come from spending reductions, about 80 per cent but about 20 per cent come from tax increases.'

On BBC Breakfast, Mr Clegg hinted that he would allow an in-out referendum on Britain's membership of the EU if he entered a new coalition with the Tories.

'We have said in law for the first time ever, if there is a change in the rules of the European Union, the so called treaties, powers are moved from Westminster and Whitehall to Brussels, there will be a referendum. 

'I have gone even further than that, I have been saying for as long as I have been leader of this party, when that referendum takes place, the decision should be in or out. 

'Our position is clear, there will be a referendum, we have guaranteed it in law, when the rules of the game change in the European Union and new things are asked of the United Kingdom and I believe that when that is held the question on the ballot paper should be in or out.'

Appearing on Sky News Radio/IRN, Mr Clegg admitted to mistakes in the early days of the coalition, saying he disappeared into the 'boiler room' of government to make 'gory decisions' but failed to speak to the public about what he was doing.

On the school visit this morning Nick Clegg's wife Miriam wore black trousers and a red print top, but for her husband's Q&A she wore a beige dress and bright orange shoes

In an apparent show of solidarity, Mrs Clegg's striking footwear matched the Lib Dems' official colours

Nick Clegg's wife Miriam sported two looks today, wearing black trousers and a red print top to Castehill Primary School in Glasgow this morning, before changing for her husband's Q&A into a beige dress and bright orange shoes.

She later attended an event called 'Inspiring Women in Scotland' where she addressed young women at New College, Kirkintilloch in Lanarkshire.
