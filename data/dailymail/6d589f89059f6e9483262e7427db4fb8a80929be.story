A shooting which left a young man dead and another seriously injured as they sat in a car could have been a ‘targeted attack’, police said tonight.

The 22-year-old who died was the passenger in a Ford Mondeo car which was stationary at traffic lights in Sheffield city centre when it was attacked last night, South Yorkshire Police said.

Officers said he suffered fatal injuries when he was shot at from the passenger side of the vehicle on the A61 Derek Dooley Way, near its junction with the Sheffield Parkway, at around 10.15pm.

The driver, a 28-year-old man, was seriously injured and is in hospital in a stable condition.

Detective Chief Inspector Phil Etheridge, who is leading the probe, said: ‘From the information we currently have, we believe there is a possibility this was a targeted attack against the two victims.

‘However it is too early in the investigation to confirm at this stage. Inquiries are ongoing at this time and officers will remain in the area today to provide reassurance to people.

‘I’d like to appeal to anyone who may have witnessed the incident, or anyone who has information, to please come forward and contact police.’

Mr Etheridge said formal identification and a post-mortem examination have not yet taken place. Both men are from the Sheffield area. No one has been arrested.

The shooting happened at one of the busiest road junctions in Sheffield, where the Parkway - the main route into the city from the M1 - meets the Inner Ring Road.

Next to where the shooting took place is office of professional services company, Capita, where employees arriving at work this morning described their shock at the tragedy.

Tom Horley, 29, said: 'I just turned up at work this morning and saw it all cordoned off. It's a bit of a scary thing to arrive at work to on a Monday morning, it's not what you expect to see.

'It's sad to hear of someone losing their life so close to Christmas. I hope the other guy pulls through.'

Kate Norman, 26, said: 'I heard about it on the news and realised where it had happened was right outside where I work. I didn't really believe it until I turned up here and saw a load police cars outside.

'I can't really believe it, it's a real shock. We're all completely gobsmacked this could happen. It's the sort of thing you see on films, not outside where you work.' 

Police are hunting the killer after the two men, both from Sheffield, were shot in a stationary vehicle

This morning a small area of road in front of Capita’s landmark Hartshead House building, a five-minute walk from the city centre, remained sealed off.

Two lanes of the Parkway were closed to traffic overnight but, by daybreak, most of the lane closures had been lifted and by this morning traffic in the area was returning to normal.

Officers in vans and police cars were watching a short stretch of coned-off road at the end of Derek Dooley Way, outside the Capita building. A small area of the Parkway, a few hundred yards away, was also coned off.

But there were no signs of any active investigation at the scene and the car targeted in the shooting had been removed.

Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, MP for Sheffield Hallam, said the shooting was a ‘tragedy’ and urged anyone with information to talk to the police. 

Sections of the road were closed this morning as police continue to investigate the late-night shooting

In a message on Twitter, Mr Clegg said: ‘Shocked to hear what happened in Sheffield. Any loss of life is a tragedy. I hope those with info will do all they can to help the police.’

Other city residents also took to Twitter this morning to express their shock at the killing.

One wrote: 'Thoughts go out to the families of the two shot young men on Sheffield Parkway. Was eerie driving down there this morning - can't believe it.'

Another added: 'Just seen the shocking news that a man has been shot dead in #Sheffield Prayers for those grieving his death.'

Officers have urged anyone with information to contact police or call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
