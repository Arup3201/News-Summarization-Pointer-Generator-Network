Judging by Stephan Brusche's creative approach to fruit he probably didn't have very good table manners as a child, as clearly he was never told off for playing with his food.

The 37-year-old graphic designer turns humble bananas into iconic characters such as Marilyn Monroe and Homer Simpson as well as animals and famous artworks.

His fruity Instagram posts  have seen him gather a loyal following almost 15,000 strong.

The Dutch artist hadn't expected his clever designs to be so moreish but the positive response has lead him to release his very first book, Fruitdoodles, which documents his initial 50 creations.

He also has his own Fruitdoodle calendar with a different creation for each month of the year.

Although Stephan has now found his edible art to be rather lucrative the designer says that his famous fruit had very humble beginnings. 

He had been in the office and had wanted to post something on Instagram. With a lack of stimulus he turned to his bright yellow snack for inspiration and drew a face on the fruit.

He told Bored Panda 'I took a ballpoint pen and just started drawing. I was pretty amazed how pleasant a banana peel is to draw on.' 

Once he had mastered the using a banana skin as a canvas Stephan began to experiment with more ambitious projects. 

Stephan began posting images of his art on his Instagram account when he was looking for something inventive to post. A giraffe winds it neck around the fruit (left) and (right) the banana is an elephant tusk

He continued: 'After that I tried to come up with new ideas for drawings while using the shape of the banana in all kinds of clever ways. 

'Trying to keep pushing myself I eventually started to carve in the banana peel as well

'They show the things I care about or like the most. Not a real agenda behind it. Mostly fun and whatever idea pops into my head when I look at a banana. 

'Though I like to make more Bible Bananas just to show how fascinating that book is.' 

Stephan has now transformed his first 50 banana designs into a book called Fruitdoodles. Here he uses two halves of a banana to form a  fine pair of horns for a Viking helmet

Stephan will carve the peel to complete his designs as with his  Homer Simpson reaching for a doughnut
