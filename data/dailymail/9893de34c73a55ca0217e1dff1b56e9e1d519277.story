Detroit's top law enforcement officer has been suspended amid allegations that he had a sexual 
relationship with a subordinate.

Chief Ralph Godbee's affair with Angelica Robinson, an internal 
affairs officer, emerged after she posted a photo with her service weapon in her mouth on Twitter, after learning Godbee was at a police conference with another woman.

Godbee had other officers locate the 37-year-old and put her under surveillance after seeing her photo.

Her attorney, David Robinson has confirmed that there was a relationship between his client and Chief Godbee, who is married but filed for divorce in August, according toÂ myFoxDetroit.com.

She now refers to herself as Godbee's former lover, and claims he is a 'sex addict,' the news website reports.

'There was a sexual relationship between my client and 
Godbee,' Robinson told The Associated Press. 'She was trying 
to end the relationship, and Godbee didn't want to let it go.'

With regards the images his client posted on Twitter, Robinson added; 'Obviously, it raised the implication of suicide.'

'The story is that she was hurt he was at a conference with 
another woman. Certainly this has created a lot of pressure. Unfairly, her 
future is a little bit uncertain. She has to suffer the humiliation.'

Angelica Robinson has been reassigned from internal affairs 
to other duties.

Her gun has since been taken away as she undergoes evaluation, myFoxDetroit.com reports.

This is the second time in two years that a Detroit police 
chief has been embroiled in scandal.

Godbee's predecessor, Warren Evans, was fired by Mayor Dave Bing in 
2010 partly because he was romantically involved with a female officer.

'After learning of the allegations regarding Chief Ralph 
Godbee, I have placed him on a 30-day suspension pending a full and thorough 
investigation of this matter,' the mayor said in a statement Tuesday that did 
not specify the allegations.

Godbee could not be reached Tuesday afternoon for comment, 
police spokeswoman Sgt. Eren Stephens said.

Angelica Robinson, who is married, told her attorney the 
relationship with Godbee lasted about a year. Godbee is separated from his 
wife.

David Robinson said the relationship was consensual.

Without being specific, Robinson said he will approach the 
city 'and see what their position would be and hopefully (the city will) do the 
right thing' in regard to his client.

'The chief of police exceeded his professional status,' 
David Robinson said. 'He's breached the trust of the department.'

Godbee and Bing have been assailed by officers in recent 
weeks over a 10 percent pay cut and implementation of 12-hour workdays to help 
cut millions of dollars from the police budget.

Officers complain the cuts and 
new work rules are too much to take in a city with one of the highest violent 
crime rates in the country.

The 287 murders committed through Sept. 23 in Detroit are 26 
more than at the same point last year.

Godbee was named chief in 2010 after Bing fired Evans.

Evans, a former Wayne County sheriff, was appointed chief by 
Bing in 2009 and fired after he raised the mayor's ire by taking part in a 
promotional video for a cable police reality show. Bing later said he also fired 
Evans because the chief was romantically involved with Lt. Monique 
Patterson.

Godbee, too, had a romantic relationship with Patterson 
before she began dating Evans and when she was Godbee's subordinate.

The prior relationship between Godbee and Patterson was 
disclosed publicly after Godbee was named interim chief, and Bing issued a 
strongly worded statement after its disclosure saying he wasn't considering 
firing Godbee for having an affair with a subordinate.

Godbee, 44, joined the department in 1987 and rose to 
assistant chief in 2007. He later retired only to be reappointed assistant chief 
in July 2009 when Evans was hired.

Assistant Chief Chester Logan will assume Godbee's 
responsibilities during the suspension, Bing said.
