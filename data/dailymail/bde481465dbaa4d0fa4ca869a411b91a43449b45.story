Accused: Holdsworth-Wild yesterday

A wheelchair-bound equalities advisor for Westminster City Council was snared arranging to have sex with a five-year-old girl and her mother, a court heard yesterday.

Andrew Holdsworth-Wild, 58, was allegedly caught red-handed at Victoria station in south-west London with a box of Smarties, a colouring book and train tickets to Maidstone, Kent.

He had organised a liaison at a Travelodge with ‘Jo’, an undercover police officer, and her fictional daughter, ‘Chloe’.

Covert officers initially made contact with Holdsworth-Wild, who is wheelchair-bound, on the nudist website, True Nudist, last February, jurors were told.

The conversations moved to an MSN forum where Holdsworth-Wild said he ‘liked playing, having sex and sexy times’, Southwark Crown Court heard.

He also said he would: ‘love to meet up with a family for a nice sexy time’ and liked girls of ‘all ages’.

Holdsworth-Wild also met with ‘Jo’ in person on July 6, later sending her a message saying he was ‘horny’.

He was arrested at Victoria two weeks later, Southwark Crown Court heard.

Holdsworth-Wild has since been dismissed from his position as inclusion and access officer at the council, following an internal investigation.

‘This case is about the defendant’s efforts to have sex with a five-year-old girl,’ prosecutor James Norman told the jury.

‘From February 22 to July 21 last year, the defendant made arrangements online and in person to have sexual intercourse with a five-year-old girl.

‘He went to Victoria railway station to meet Jo and Chloe to go to a Travelodge in Maidstone, where he planned to have sex with the girl and her mother. 

‘While waiting at the station he bought Smarties, a colouring book and tickets. 

‘Fortunately, Chloe does not exist and Jo is an undercover police officer. 

‘The people the defendant met at the station were police officers who arrested him.’

Holdsworth-Wild admitted having the conversations with the undercover officers and making the arrangements to visit Kent, Mr Norman said.

‘His case is these discussions were nothing more than fantasies and he never actually intended to have sex with Chloe,’ he added.

‘On February 22, a police officer called Gary made contact with the defendant.

‘Initially that took place on True Nudist website then Gary suggested moving the contact onto MSN chat, so it could be more easily recorded for evidential purposes, unbeknownst to the defendant.’

‘It’s obvious the defendant thought he was talking to a fellow paedophile,’ Mr Norman said.

‘There is absolutely no doubt looking at those exchanges that the defendant has a sexual interest in children.’

Wearing a dark green blazer, white collarless shirt and black trousers and shoes, Holdsworth-Wild was allowed to remain outside the dock due to his disability.

Holdsworth-Wild, of Yew Tree Court, Chy Hwel, Truro, Cornwall, denies a single count of arranging the commission of a child sex offence.

The trial continues.
