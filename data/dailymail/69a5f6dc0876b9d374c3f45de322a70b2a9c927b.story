America's most hated mother Casey Anthony has been found ten months after she went into hiding following her sensational acquittal over the murder of her two-year-old daughter Caylee.

The 26-year-old, who has been vilified by the public after a jury found her not guilty despite a string of inconsistencies in her trial defence, was served a court order for a defamation case.

She will now face a judge again in connection with the controversial murder probe after investigators staked out her hideout in Florida and served her with a subpoena.

Facing judge again: Casey Anthony, pictured posing in a recent racy Facebook snap,  is being sued for defamation by Zenaida Gonzalez, who shares the name with a fake kidnapper made up by Anthony

She is being sued by Zenaida Gonzalez, who shares the name of a fake babysitter 'Zanny the Nanny' who Anthony initially told police had kidnapped Caylee. Anthony admitted fabricating that story.

It later emerged that Anthony, whose acquittal last July has been compared to the infamous OJ Simpson case, did not know anyone by that name and the real Miss Gonzalez is not even a nanny.

Now Miss Gonzalez is suing her after claiming she lost her job and apartment due to the association with the disappearance of Caylee, whose body was found in woods near Anthony's home in 2008.

After initially sticking by the claim that the kidnapper had been kidnapped, Anthony's lawyers then insisted at the start of the trial that Caylee had accidentally drowned in the family's swimming pool.

It is this primary Inconsistency in her story that has sparked public outrage in the case and forced the defendant into hiding after her release from Orange County Jail.

Her attorneys asked that she not be forced to appear in court, saying she has received death threats since being found not guilty of murder, aggravated child abuse and aggravated manslaughter.

She was convicted of four counts of lying to police and is now on probation on an unrelated cheque fraud conviction.

The defamation trial is set to begin at the start of the New Year. But, as Anthony had not been seen in public, lawyers for Miss Gonzalez feared she might go missing and decided to track her down.

They staked out her home for several days without Anthony appearing to be served a subpoena. Eventually, the defendant's lawyers intervened and said she would attend the court hearing.

'Our investigation team had her whereabouts pinned down,' Miss Gonzalez's attorney Matt Morgan told People magazine.

'Their backs were against the wall, so her attorneys said that they would accept service on her behalf.'

Despite going into hiding, Anthony had not entirely shied away from publicity.

In October she appeared in a video diary that she posted on YouTube. In it she said she was 'making changes for herself', although failed to mention Caylee.

It has since been claimed that she become a newborn Christian and was been baptised again in a bid to  symbolise a new beginning.

However, this apparent new devotion to faith has not stopped her revealing a string of racy photographs of herself.

Anthony has been in hiding in Florida since she was acquitted last July in one of the most controversial verdicts since the OJ Simpson case.

She was released from prison after a jury found her not guilty of killing her daughter Caylee in 2008, after the toddler's remains were found in woods near Anthony's family's home.
