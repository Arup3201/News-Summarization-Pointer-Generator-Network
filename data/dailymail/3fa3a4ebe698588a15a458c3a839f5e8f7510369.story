Director General Lord Hall is alleged to have intervened in the programme's broadcast

The BBC is to finally screen an investigation into claims that millions of pounds donated to Comic Relief were invested in tobacco and arms firms instead of going straight to charity.

The corporation said it would broadcast the Panorama documentary in the coming weeks after it was reportedly twice shelved by bosses.

The probe, which says £150million was invested for eight years before being handed to good causes, is potentially embarrassing for the BBC, which has close ties to Comic Relief.

It is thought it can only be shown now after bosses reviewed the footage.

The programme was initially cancelled by executives in the run-up to 
Children in Need in November, drawing parallels with the decision not to
screen a Newsnight exposé on allegations of sexual abuse by Jimmy 
Savile.

Critics said the Comic Relief probe had 
been shelved because the revelations would have damaged its fundraising 
potential but the BBC insisted it simply needed more time so it could 
meet its ‘robust editorial standards’.

BBC director general Lord Hall and 
director of news James Harding are said to have intervened personally to
ensure the documentary was rescheduled.

At the Voice of the Listener
& Viewer autumn conference last week, Lord Hall said: ‘It’s James’s
programme. He wants to get it right.

'It’s quite right the director of 
news has views about programmes. It’ll broadcast.’ 

Viewers who donated to Comic Relief will 
be shocked their money was for years invested rather than going straight
to impoverished people around the world.

The Panorama probe looks at how 
£150million donated by the public to Comic Relief was invested for eight
years before being passed on to charities.

Included in this was 
£14million put into the Invesco Perpetual High Income Fund, which 
invests in three of the world’s biggest cigarette firms and arms giant 
BAE Systems.

The six-month investigation for Panorama by independent 
TV company Matchlight also suggests Comic Relief has been sitting on 
£261million in shares, bonds and cash and owed £126million.

Staff 
costs have doubled at the charity from £7.1million a year in 2008 to 
£13.5million by 2012. Last year, however, it raised £87.8million - less 
than in two of the three previous years.

The BBC has had long ties with Comic Relief which has been broadcast by the corporation for over 25 years

It has also emerged that the charity, which is backed by many celebrities, made a huge loss of £800,000 on a failed venture selling Gordon Ramsay-branded sauces.

After the Panorama programme was initially shelved, Mr Harding is thought to have asked producers to provide more compelling evidence from their investigation before ensuring it was rescheduled.

Ahead of it being aired, executives have now allegedly reviewed the programme, which looks at several charities and how they invest funds.

The bosses stepped in after senior executives supposedly excused themselves from ruling on whether the programme could run.

The BBC has extremely close ties with Comic Relief dating back almost 30 years.

The scandal has been likened to the decision not to broadcast a programme on Jimmy Savile

The Red Nose Day and Sport Relief telethons are broadcast on the BBC and Danny Cohen, the Director of BBC TV, and directors Tim Davie and Peter Salmon are Comic Relief trustees.

A BBC spokeswoman confirmed the Panorama special would be broadcast. It is expected to air on Tuesday December 10.

She added: ‘BBC News and Current Affairs acts entirely independently of the wider BBC in commissioning and preparing programmes.

'It is simply wrong to suggest that the timing of the proposed Panorama investigation into the charity sector has in any way been influenced by the timing of Children in Need.

‘The planned broadcast date of this investigation was delayed until we were satisfied that the programme met our robust editorial standards and we hope to schedule the programme to air in the near future.’

A spokeswoman for Comic Relief said allegations about its investment strategy were ‘inaccurate, misleading and show a total lack of understanding of the actual position’.

‘Comic Relief takes the business of making grants and managing the money so generously donated by the public extremely seriously.

‘We’re satisfied that our approach is wholly appropriate and meets all regulatory and legal requirements. We have nothing to hide and publish a full explanation on our website.'
