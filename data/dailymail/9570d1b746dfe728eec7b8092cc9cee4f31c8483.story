A couple who had been married for 67 years have died just 32 hours apart - unaware that the other had passed.

Olympia DeNittis, 95, from Woodbridge, New Jersey, passed away just hours ahead of her husband, Michael, 94, because he had cancer and she wanted to 'show him the way', relatives said.

The beloved grandmother had suffered a bout of pneumonia and, after refusing to eat and becoming weaker, she died at 4.30am on Sunday at JFK Medical Center's Haven Hospice in Edison.

Just 32 hours later, her husband, who had been battling stage IV colon cancer for nearly
 four years, passed at 12:23 p.m. on Monday at Robert Wood 
Johnson University Hospital in New Brunswick.

When their granddaughter went to visit Mr DeNittis in
 hospital before his death, he inquired about how her grandmother was doing, but she 
could not bring herself to tell him that she had passed.

Bizarrely, he told her that he had dreamed of dying the night before.

'I think, instinctually, he knew she had died,' AnnMarie McDonald told the Star-Ledger.

McDonald, 29, said she thinks her grandmother wanted to die first.

'I think she was dying of a broken heart,' McDonald told the Asbury Park Press. 'But I also think she wanted to pass first so he wouldnâ€™t have to enter 
heaven without her there to welcome him.'

Mr DeNittis had been in the hospital for 
just over a week before his death, while his wife had been in for 
slightly longer, McDonald told MailOnline.

Sweethearts: The couple grew up a block from each other and married after he served in World War II

'She sensed my grandfather was on borrowed time, and she wanted to make sure she died before him,' she said. 'She wanted to show him the way.'

The pair grew up a block apart in Port Reading and were 'childhood sweethearts' before marrying when DeNittis returned from World War II.

They married when Mrs DeNittis was 28 - which was old for the time, her granddaughter said - but she had been adamant that she wanted to wait until after the war so she was not left a widow.

She was also the first woman in Port Reading to complete her driver's license.

'After she got 
hers, everyone else wanted to get their license,' McDonald said. 'She was a little feminist for sure.'

Her grandfather worked as head custodian at Woodbridge High School, while her grandmother worked as a factory seamstress.

Family: They are pictured with their granddaughters AnnMarie at her first birthday party in 1985. She said her grandparents valued their family above all else and 'life will never be the same without them'

They have left behind a daughter, Ann, her husband, Georgie, and two granddaughters.

'I will always remember them as individuals of strong will and conviction,' McDonald told MailOnline. 'My grandfather could enter a room with one hundred strangers and leave with one hundred new friends.

'My grandmother was a quiet leader. She lived in the same home her entire 95 years. She taught me to read long before I ever set foot in a classroom.

'Each of them valued family above all. Life will never be the same without them, but they were remarkable people whose story should be kept alive.'
