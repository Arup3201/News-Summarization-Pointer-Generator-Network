The more Americans think about Jeb Bush and Mitt Romney taking up residence in the White House, the less they like them, according to a poll released Tuesday. The two default Republican 2016 front-runners have seen their approval ratings tumble since they started publicly discussing their presidential bona fides.

According to the Wall Street Journal/NBC poll, Romney gets positive marks from just 27 per cent of Americans and 52 per cent of Republicans.

The numbers inside the GOP are down 8 points since September, long before his presidential buzz started and at a time when few observers expected him to mount a third White House campaign.

Bush does even worse, with only 19 per cent of Americans saying they like him – down 7 points since November, before he launched a presidential exploratory committee. 

THIRD TIME'S THE CHARM? Mitt Romney has ground to make up with voters before he can count on another Republican presidential nomination

NOT YET IMPRESSIVE: Jeb Bush, a former Florida governor and the younger brother of former President George W. Bush, gets positive marks from fewer than 1 in 5 Americans

Both men are 'under water' with Americans – a polling term that describes candidates who attract more negatives than positives. 

Fully 40 per cent of Americans have a sour taste in their mouths over Romney, who lost to President Barack Obama in 2012. That's 13 percentage points more than the number who like him. 

President George W. Bush's brother is 13 points under water, with a 32 per cent negative approval rating.

Much of the electorate has yet to make up its mind, the new poll shows.

But inside the Republican party a battle is brewing over whether the 2016 nomination should go to an avowed conservative or a more pragmatic moderate.

Both Romney and Bush fall in the moderate wing of the party – a contingent that tea party backers complain lost them the presidency in 2012 with Romney and in 2008 with Arizona Sen. John McCain.

DISTANCE: Jeb stumped for Mitt in 2012, but the two will likely go head-to-head this year for the hearts and minds of Republican centrists

They point back as far as then-Sen.Bob Dole's crushing 1996 loss to President Bill Clinton as evidence that Americans will only elect a Republican whose positions are full-throated and unapologetically conservative.

By that measure, Bush is far behind Romney.

Bush wins positive thoughts from a scant 30 per cent of self-described conservatives, compared to 45 per cent for Romney.

Ultimately, hard-line right-wingers will likely break for other candidates.

Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, for instance, will work to lock up support from tea partiers after he announces his White House bid. Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul is expected to make a pitch that's attractive to libertarian-leaning conservatives who are angered by what they see as over-reaching government surveillance.

And Marco Rubio, the junior senator from Florida, could be attractive to Hispanic Americans and those who see Obama's new Cuba policy as a moral failing.

If Bush or Romney strays too far to the center, an Iowa political consultant told DailyMail.com on Tuesday, their conpetitors open arms will be waiting.

'These guys have to walk a fine line,' said the adviser, who is working for an undeclared but likely GOP 2016 hopeful. 'All it takes is one speech where you sound too much like the president, and you're no longer the flavor of the month.'

'Remember that it's the conservative activists, and all their enthusiasm, that drives the primary process. Moderates come out to vote, but they tend to wait to see who gets nominated before they take the time to care a lot.' 

He spoke on condition of anonymity, he said, in order to protect his future business prospects. 

Romney and Bush may soon both prove him right.

On Monday night in Indian Wells, California, Romney told an audience of supporters that he favors an increased minimum wage and is warming to the idea of man-made climate change.

His evolving climate views could expose him to charges of flip-flopping. In late 2011 he told voters that 'we don't know what’s causing climate change on this planet. And the idea of spending trillions and trillions of dollars to try to reduce CO2 emissions is not the right course for us.'

GLORY DAYS: In 2012 Romney, shown with running mate Rep Paul Ryan (left), was Republicans' best hope to unseat Obama -- but now he's treading water

The mega-millionaire also embraced an Obama-esque theme of income inequality on Monday night, saying: 'I don't like the fact that middle America feels they can't get ahead' economically.

Bush's problems with the GOP's right wing stem from his backing of the federal government's 'Common Core' national education standards and his liberal-leaning position on immigration reform

Most conservatives believe states and counties, not the feds, should set education policy. And Obama's move to mainstream millions of illegal immigrants with residency cards and work permits is increasingly unpopular.

A Washington Post/ABC News poll published Monday found that 57 per cent of registered voters in the U.S. think the plan, which side-steps Congress and relies on hotly disputed executive authority, should be blocked on Capitol Hill.
