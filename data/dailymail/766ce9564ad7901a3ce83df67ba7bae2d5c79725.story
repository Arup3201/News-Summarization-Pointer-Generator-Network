With rain-soaked summers like these, us Brits are lucky to have such glamorous heritage to brighten even the dullest days.

Dolled-up 1940s style singers and energetic burlesque dancers kept the crowd's spirits up as they huddled beneath their umbrellas in the garden at Killerton House, near Exeter.

Events company Crikey its Vintage and National Trust's Killerton House teamed up for the first time ever to put on the two day vintage experience. The House's parkland, garden and house were the backdrop to the blast from the past this 22 and 23 June.

The two day event gave men, women and 
children the chance to step back in time and fall in love with vintage.

One 
of the largest vintage events undertaken by both Crikey its Vintage and 
the National Trust, the weekend featured up to 60 stalls of vintage and retro fashion, crafts, home-ware, antiques and paraphernalia.

With fashion shows, classic car 
displays, food, drink and music it was a real festival for nostalgia.

On the evening of Saturday 22 June, the gardens hosted top 1940s style vintage 
singer Lola Lamour and her blue light boys. She wore a vintage green belted dress with matching satin gloves which contrasted beautifully with her scarlet hair and lipstick.

She sang in a marquee erected in the gardens at Killerton House's gardens as crowds danced and even 
took part in the Charleston swing despite the rain and wind.

Defiant burlesque dancers performed 
fan dances as well as classic stripteases on the garden when the rain 
was at bay. Masked and corseted, the dancers accessorised their outfits 
with satin gloves, fringing, pearls, bustles and feather fans as they performed in front of an entranced crowd of vintage aficionados.

Fashionable shoppers turned out in 
fetching turban-style hats or silk headscarves to admire and try on the 
vintage offerings on the colourful fashion stalls. Quirky vintage 
homeware items were also displayed for sale under marquees to keep 
shelter from potential rain.

Felicity Boucher, Killerton's Visitor
Services Officer said: 'It's been really exciting, we are so pleased 
with the turn out and the festival atmosphere of the event.

'Killerton is the perfect setting for
a vintage celebration with the famous costume collection and stunning 
open spaces to help set the scene and get people into the vintage 
spirit.'

Stall holder Jeannette Redhead from record label Kitsch 
And Sync said: 'There has been a great English spirit as everyone has 
had a great time despite the weather, its been a real life keep calm and
carry on mentality.

'The National Trust has been great and very hands on helping us through the wind and rain.'
