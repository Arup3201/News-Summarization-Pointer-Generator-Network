Heaving bosoms, haughty put-downs, a smattering of suspicion and a huge dollop of deceit...

Add dazzling period costumes and a mysterious murder and the battle lines are drawn for the clash of the TV period dramas this Christmas.

Downton Abbey’s two-hour festive special is sure to attract millions of viewers to ITV. But not to be cowed, the BBC has responded by reviving one of literature’s greatest heroines – and one of its biggest audience hits – with an imaginative sequel to Pride And Prejudice.

As the dramas prepare to square up, The Mail on Sunday has been given exclusive access to both to predict which might come out on top. But don’t worry, we won’t ruin the endings.

Jane Austen’s best-known characters, Elizabeth Bennet and Mr Darcy,  are returning to our screens thanks to a three-part adaptation of PD James’s best-selling novel Death Comes To Pemberley, with Matthew Rhys taking the romantic role of Darcy that catapulted the wet-shirted Colin Firth to stardom.

The sequel picks up the story when Darcy and Lizzie have been married for six years.

Now parents to two young sons, they are preparing for the annual ball at their palatial Pemberley home when the unannounced arrival of Lydia Wickham, Elizabeth’s wayward sister, brings an shocking halt to proceedings. 

Shrieking loudly, Lydia stumbles out of her carriage yelling that her husband George, the caddish soldier with whom she eloped in Austen’s novel, has been murdered.

Darcy quickly sends out a search party and a bloody corpse is discovered. But is the victim Wickham, or his friend Captain Denny?

Meanwhile at Downton Abbey the Crawleys, too, are preparing for a party.  The flighty Lady Rose is ‘coming out’ at her debutante’s ball where she will be presented to King George V, so the family have decamped to London. 

And for widowed Lady Mary, the continued attentions of two adoring suitors – Lord Gillingham and Charles Blake – leads to an agonising quandary...
