MPs have called on the Government to prevent tax money being used for an appeal by one of the killers of soldier Lee Rigby.

MPs have reacted with outrage to what they claim is an attempt by Michael Adebolajo to use the courts for ‘jihadi grandstanding’.

At his trial, Adebolajo admitted the killing and said: ‘I am a soldier of Allah, and jihad sometimes entails killing the enemy.’

If judges hear Adebolajo’s appeal, his barristers will be entitled to claim thousands of pounds in fees from the Court of Appeal.

Tory Rob Wilson MP told The Mail on Sunday: ‘This man hacked another man to death in front of cameras.

'There simply cannot be any grounds for appeal and any sensible system would not allow itself to be played in this way.’

He added: ‘If it is open to such abuse, then it must be urgently reformed.’

Victim: Adebolajo, together with Michael Adebowale, 22, mowed down Fusilier Rigby (pictured) in a car, before hacking him to death in Woolwich, south east London, in May last year

Jailed: Adebolajo (left) was condemned to die 
behind bars - with the judge saying he had 'no real 
prospect of rehabilitation'. However, Adebowale (right) was sentenced to
 a minimum of 45 years in jail

His comments follow a call by Tory MP David Nuttall for a Commons debate on payments in ‘hopeless’ appeals used to promote a terrorist agenda. 

Commons Leader Andrew Lansley responded that although aid was given in criminal cases, it depended on whether judges granted Adebolajo leave to appeal.

Although legal aid is given in criminal cases, it is up to judges in each individual case whether to grant it
