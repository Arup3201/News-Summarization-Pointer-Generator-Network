Portable beach jails and extra police officers have been deployed to beaches in Florida to cope with the spring break invasion.

The move comes after a huge spike in crime as thousands of teenagers hit the state’s Gulf Coast for the annual vacation.

In the first week of spring break on Panama City Beach alone, already more than 210 arrests have been made for underage drinking, public intoxication, DUI, and one person has been charged with sexual assault.

Portable jails: The mobile unit on Panama City Beach allows officers to deal with offences quickly

One university student, Reny Jose, has been missing for more than a week after taking the hallucinogenic drug LCD at a beach house.

And 21-year-old Rebecca Denardis, of Cary, was killed when the car she was driving was hit by a truck in a DUI-related crash.

Panama City Beach Police Chief Drew Whitman said the portable jails had been brought in to allow officers to crack down on underage drinking and other offences without making the two-hour round-trip from the beach to the county jail.

Annual holiday: Up to 300,000 students are expected to visit Panama City Beach during spring break

He said: 'The hotels have extra security staff, we have on our website information about how to enjoy spring break responsibly, and police walk the beaches and interact with the kids throughout the day to make sure that they are staying smart and to addresses situations before they occur.'

About 300,000 college students are expected to converge on Panama City Beach during March. 

More than half this number will crowd Orlando's theme parks and attractions, with spring break the third busiest time of the year for the city.

Paul Phipps, spokesman for Visit Florida, said he was expecting bumper tourism levels in March and April, with numbers already up on last year.

'We expect that trend to continue,' he added.
