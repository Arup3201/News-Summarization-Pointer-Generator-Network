Justice: Carmen Montelongo, 54, of California, has been convicted of first-degree murder in the death of Samuel Wiggins, 62, in May 2011

A 54-year-old California woman was sentenced to 26 years to life this week after being convicted of stabbing to death her boyfriend, dismembering his body and burying some of the remains in potted plants.

Carmen Montelongo, of Riverside, was found guilty in late August of first-degree murder in connection to the grisly 2011 slaying of 62-year-old Samuel Wiggins.

‘We are pleased that the jury saw the case for what it was — a heinous crime — and that justice was served for the victim and his family,’ said Deputy District Attorney Erica Gallegos in a press release.

Ms Montelongo, who also goes by the alias Montenegro, was arrested in late May 2011 after she was spotted wheeling a barrel in San Bernadino, California, reeking of decomposing flesh.

Police officers who became suspicious of the malodorous container looked inside and found a man's torso and two legs mingled with soil.

The rest of the victim’s remains, including the head, were discovered hidden inside two flower pots at a home in the Los Angeles suburb of Bell Gardens, NBC Los Angeles reported. 

Mr Wiggins was reported missing by his relatives in early May 2011 - about a month after he was last seen alive

According to the prosecutors, Montelongo killed him a short time later by stabbing her boyfriend twice in the chest and 22 times in the back.

Cover-up: The woman lied to police about being in contact with the missing man so she could clean up the crime scene and withdraw money from his bank accounts 

She then tried to cover up the crime by telling police that she was in regular contact with Wiggins. By the time detectives arrived at his home, the crime scene had been cleaned up and the carpet and floor tiles removed, according to Los Angeles Times.   

The woman lived in her slain boyfriend's house and used his bank accounts until May 29, 2011, when she was caught by detectives looking into her possible involvement in Wiggins' disappearance carting away his body parts in a bin.

Two of Montelongo's grown children, Daniel and Chanel Ortiz, were initially arrested on suspicion of helping their mother dispose of the body, but they were never charged.
