A 20-year-old woman has been jailed for six years after she falsely accused a man of rape then led a gang to beat him to death.

Latiqwa Mayes was enraged that her victim Donald Robinson had not received a stricter sentence for breaking into her room and assaulting her friend at a boardinghouse.

Months later, she saw him walking down the street in Baltimore, Maryland, and yelled: 'He raped me! He's a sex offender!'

According to the Baltimore Sun, her father, Willie Mayes, rushed over and a group of teenagers playing basketball nearby joined to hold Robinson down.

Surveillance footage of the attack on September 2, 2013, then showed passers-by joining the attack to kick and punch Robinson as Latiqwa Mayes pepper-sprayed him.

Robinson stumbled away from the scene but hours later fell ill.

He was pronounced dead in hospital and an autopsy stated the beating as the cause of death.

Slamming Latiqwa Mayes, who has been in solitary confinement since September 2013, Judge Timothy Doory said Robinson's offense did 'not justify a call to the community to impose physical, violent retribution.'

Complicit: Her father Willie Mayes joined the attack. He was jailed for two years for second-degree murder

Joshua Insley, defending, argued Robinson was a dangerous sex offender that should have been off the streets and violated his parole.

He said: 'They wanted him to never come back, with good reason.'

However, Judge Doory dismissed the claims, insisting they 'went too far'.

Latiqwa and Willie Mayes both pleaded guilty to second-degree murder.

They were each sentenced to 10 years in prison, however Latiqwa will serve six and Willie will serve two, with the other years suspended.
