It is a dramatic stretch of clifftop much loved by ramblers and fossil hunters.

But visitors to the Jurassic Coast yesterday found a new sight to take their breath away . . . this huge chasm.

A landslip – caused by months of heavy rain – opened up a 150ft-long crevasse between Redcliff Point and Bowleaze Cove.

Earth-moving: A 150ft crevasse has opened up along the Jurassic Coastline in Dorset

Ramblers and dog walkers are being warned to take extra care near the landslip

The crack is believed to have been caused by heavy rainfall during the winter months

The cliff, near Weymouth, Dorset, is 
on the 95-mile Jurassic Coast, a UNESCO World Heritage Site famed for 
discoveries of fossils from the age of the dinosaurs, including the 
skull of a pliosaur – the largest marine reptile that ever lived.

Rambler David Fry, 59, was with his 
wife and a neighbour when they came across the chasm, which is up to 4ft
wide and 6ft deep. ‘We are used to seeing cracks but not ones of this 
huge size,’ he said.

Richard Edmonds, a geologist from the 
Jurassic Coast World Heritage Site, said: ‘We have clays in the lower 
part of the cliff and limestone in the top which is porous.

All that 
rain we had has seeped through the limestone and got to the clay, which 
adds weight to the cliff and lubricates it, causing the landslide.

The Jurassic Coast has been designated a World Heritage Site and is regarded as one of Britain's finest beauty spots

Thousands of tons of rocks fell down the coast when the huge crevasse opened up

'There’s a danger land that has become separated will move further.’

Portland Coastguard said: ‘We want 
people to enjoy the coast but they must pay heed to warning signs, stay 
away from the edge and keep dogs on a lead.’

Forecasters predict more rain across much of the country today with cold and unsettled weather continuing well into next week.
