World Champion Ronnie O'Sullivan reacted angrily to the BBC's new arena-based studio during his semi-final against Barry Hawkins.Â 

The Rocket gesticulated at the box after hearing noise coming from the TV studio in the first frame of the best-of-33 encounter.

The cause of the disturbance turned out to be former champions John Parrott and Stephen Hendry, who O'Sullivan overheard talking to presenter Jason Mohammad.

Arena-side: The BBC's new studio, which they are using for the semi-finals and final and the crucible

In form: O'Sullivan shrugged off the distraction to lead 6-2 after the first session as he looks to defend his title

The studio has been moved inside the 
arena for the final few days of the World Championship at the Crucible 
theatre in Sheffield. It is the first time the BBC have had a studio inside the Crucible.

Mike Ganley, the tournament director, said: 'There was just a reminder about how quiet guests have to be during play.

'It is also the same for the commentators in their booth, but they are probably more used to that environment.'

O'Sullivan shrugged off the distraction to race into a 6-2 lead after the first session yesterday. He is looking to defend his title and win a sixth World Championship.

Up against it: Hawkins, who lost to O'Sullivan in last year's final, will need to focus if he is to progress
