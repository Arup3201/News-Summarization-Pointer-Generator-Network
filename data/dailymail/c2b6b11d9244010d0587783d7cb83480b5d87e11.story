Marks and Spencer may have revealed their new 'Leading Ladies' this week but they haven't forgotten their long-time collaborator and model Rosie Huntington-Whiteley.

Rosie, who designs a lingerie range for the high street chain, is now fronting their new Autograph campaign.

The 26-year-old, who we are more accustomed to seeing in her knickers, has swapped lingerie for feminine summer dresses in the new shoot.

Don't forget me! The main focus this week has been on M&S' Leading Ladies campaign starring the likes of Rita Ora and Emma Thompson but Rosie Huntington-Whiteley has been modelling for the store too

The
 new season's collection, showcased to perfection by the Devon-born model, is a range of summery dresses emblazoned with abstract leaf prints and sleek monochrome 
stripes.

So if you are looking for summer wardrobe inspiration then Autograph has it covered in the form of chic tailored shifts, maxi length dresses, oversized clutches and strappy sandals.

As well as modelling for the store, Rosie has just designed her SS14 Autograph underwear line, too.

Rosie's latest range for M&S is full of feminine and romantic pink and grey bra sets, pyjamas and camisoles.

The Transformers star ensures she is 
involved in every process of her range, from selecting the fabrics and 
prints to modelling and promoting it.

Speaking about her passion for lingerie to The Coveteur last month, the designer said: 'I have used vintage slips and gowns a lot to influence my designs for Rosie for Autograph.

'There's nothing sexier than confidence, so I think it's important to find lingerie that make you feel the best you can feel. Maybe it's a bra and suspenders, maybe it's a silky slip and robe.

'Put a dab of your favorite fragrance on, light a few candles and have fun!'.

Model behaviour: From print inspiration to modelling the range, Rosie ensures that she is involved in every step

The model - who describes her range as 'her baby' - explained that she finds inspiration on her travels, in flea markets and even when she's 'killing time' scrolling through Instagram.

Aside from her Rosie For Autograph 
lingerie line for the British store, Rosie is 
set to star in Mad Max: Fury Road, alongside Tom Hardy and Nicholas 
Hoult.

The sci-fi action adventure movie is a
 sequel to the films that kick-started Mel Gibson's career and it is
 currently in post-production.

In 2011 Rosie replaced Megan Fox in Transformers: Dark of The Moon, her first movie role.

Meanwhile her relationship with actor Jason Statham seems to be going from strength to strength and the couple seem happier than ever.
