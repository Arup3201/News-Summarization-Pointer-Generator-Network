A man has been arrested after claiming he had a bomb on board a Ryanair flight from Krakow, Poland, to Shannon, Ireland.

The plane was just north of Dresden on Monday night when the pilot and crew decided the only option was to make an emergency landing after the 33-year-old allegedly made several comments about having a bomb.

Flight FR-3326 landed at Berlin Schönefeld airport in Germany, where the man was arrested and is in the custody of the German Police.

After the passengers had disembarked the plane, a full search was carried out by the police and special forces, but no bomb was found.

The search lasted several hours, meaning the Boeing 737-800 didn't land at Shannon until 5am yesterday morning, five hours behind schedule. 

Ryanair spokesman Robin Kiely said: 'This flight from Krakow to Shannon diverted to Berlin following a hoax security alert.

'Customers disembarked while the aircraft was inspected by police, who detained one individual, before the aircraft was cleared to depart for Shannon.

'Ryanair sincerely apologised to all customers affected by this delay to their journey, however the safety of our customers, crew and aircraft is our number one priority. 

'This is now a matter for German police.'
