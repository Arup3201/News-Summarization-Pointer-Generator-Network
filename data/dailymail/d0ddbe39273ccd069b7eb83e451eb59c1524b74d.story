One player at Leyton Orient is understood to be earning more than £20,000 a week.

Take a deep breath.

Yes, twenty grand.

That’s a million a year plus change.

In League One.

And what does that buy the club nearest and dearest to my heart?

Leyton Orient are second bottom of League One and in real danger of relegation to the fourth tier

Fabio Liverani's Orient side were beaten 4-1 by Scunthorpe last weekend at the Matchroom Stadium

Right now we are languishing next to bottom of the third tier of English football, with relegation to the bottom rung of the Football League looking more likely with every passing week.

Even though they sack managers almost as often as the team change their socks it would be harsh to blame Orient’s new Italian owners. They have ploughed tens of millions into the club since taking over from Barry Hearn last summer.

So what have Francesco Becchetti and his amici learned from this deflating experience thus far? Exactly what the occupants of that glittering ivory tower way above them, the Premier League, keep discovering.

That the more you pay the lesser the likelihood that your players will stay super-fit, obsessively focused and prepared to die with their boots on for very long at all.

Real Madrid star Cristiano Ronaldo passed the age of 30 but remains in prime physical condition

It is a rare breed of young sportsmen who get filthy rich overnight yet are still hungry for success, year in year out.

Rather, once they have shot to fame and fortune they disappear up their own ego, then reappear in night clubs.

For every Cristiano Ronaldo there are dozens of Jack Wilsheres.

As he turns 30, Ronaldo is in such prime physical condition that he looks as if he could carry on winning the World Footballer of the Year award for another five seasons.

His insatiable desire to pile up more honours with Real Madrid and to keep proving himself the best player on the planet – better even than Lionel Messi - supplies that urge to train like a demon, live right, eat healthy and eschew the vices.

Ronaldo will not rest until he has given every last fibre to try and surpass Pele as the greatest of all time

By his own manic admission, Ronaldo will not rest until he has given every last fibre of his being trying to surpass Pele as the greatest footballer of all time.

The advances in sports science – medical, dietary and a programmed lifestyle which allows for not only Spartan exercise but repetitive skills practice – is raising the age barrier for the dedicated few.

The birthday which Ronaldo celebrated on Thursday by sipping a nutritional drink used to be the watershed age for footballers. Now several of the world’s best are performing at the elite level well into their 30s.

Messi is no slouch but one vital dimension in which Ronaldo surpassed him to win the Ballon d’Or last month is the physical.

That takes single-minded commitment.

Most of Ronaldo’s down time is devoted to rest and recovery, for which his home is filled with state-of-the-art equipment. When the majority of his Madrid team-mates arrive for training they usually find him stretching and exercising in the gymnasium, not only to build strength but to ensure that his body is ready for the coming session on the pitch.

Real coach Paul Clement reports: ‘Cristiano is really pushing the boundaries.’

Since much of this hard work is also designed to reduce the risk of injury it is not inconceivable that Ronaldo could still be near his peak 10 years from now, as he approaches his 40th birthday.

No wonder Sir Alex Ferguson was so reluctant to let him leave Old Trafford. Ask the greatest of all British managers what attributes mattered most to him when signing a player, he usually replies along these lines: ‘If Manchester United are considering someone you can assume he has real talent. So what I’m looking for then is character. A lad desperate to win, who will want to keep on and on and on winning.’

Younger players of that ilk coming up behind Ronaldo and who will benefit from ever-improving methods if they so choose - Brazilian genius Neymar who is naturally so lean and lithe notable among them – might actually remain fully in their prime to 40.

Meanwhile Master Wilshere has been photographed yet again in a nightclub, for the third time in a pose which suggests he has been smoking.

Young Jack is fortunate that the rebuke from his Arsenal manager will be moderated by Arsene Wenger’s admission that he used to smoke and his expression of opinion that the habit ‘does not necessarily impact on a player’s performance.’

In that, history is on Wenger’s side.

Ossie Ardiles was both a cigarette smoker and one of the world’s outstanding players for a decade, orchestrating from midfield Argentina’s 1978 World Cup triumph under chain-smoking manager Cesar Luis Menotti and lighting up before lifting the FA Cup with Tottenham at Wembley.

But it is not so much the quick drag which is worrying for we who recognise that Wilshere has the ability to grow into an important player for England. It is the louche lifestyle.

Mostly, for top sportsmen, the days are for training, the evenings for rest, the nights for sleeping not clubbing.

At 23, Wilshere is young enough to learn from his mistakes and turn his life around. As he keeps promising to do. But if he leaves it much longer it will be too late for him to fulfil all that talent. Like plenty before him.

You have to fear for him. Because it is also about the money.

The incentive to prioritise sporting dedication over life’s temptations comes more naturally to those of more modest means.

And if you think the £100,000-plus weekly wages of the most celebrated players in this country are ludicrously excessive, you ain’t seen nothing yet.

Sky Sports face a four-way battle to keep hold of the lion's share of Premier League rights

A Premier League already awash with cash is about see its next package deal for three years of TV rights soar above the current £3billion. Perhaps by double. To more than £8m for a single match.

That will be the result of a bidding war as two more networks – one the American parent company of Eurosport, the other in oil-rich Qatar – go against Sky and BT for live games.

Be sure that a large chunk of the extra fortune will be grasped by the star players.

Some will filter down to the Football League.

Until that happens we wait to see if twenty grand a week will be enough for Orient to clamber clear of the drop.

We can but hope...
