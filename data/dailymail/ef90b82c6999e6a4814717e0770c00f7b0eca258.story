As Brendan Rodger's Liverpool were enjoying success on the pitch against Southampton, there were some hints that the manager may be similarly successful off it.

The 41-year-old's girlfriend, Charlotte Hind, was in the director's box at Anfield to watch the home side beat the Saints 2-1 in their opening Premier League game.

Hind and Rodgers have been together since the end of last season, but the 31-year-old has not been spotted at matches before.

 Liverpool opened the scoring when a scything Jordan Henderson pass was met by Raheem Sterling, who guided the ball past Fraser Forster.

Ronald Koeman's side hit back with brilliant goal - Dusan Tadic's backheel was met by Nathaniel Clyne who rifled the ball in to the net.

But Rodgers' side had the last laugh as Daniel Sturridge guided in Sterling's header to put Liverpool joint top of the table.
