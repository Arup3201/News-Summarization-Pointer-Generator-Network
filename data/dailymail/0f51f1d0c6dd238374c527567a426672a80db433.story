A mother has been arrested for allegedly using her 12-year-old son as a drugs mule.

Police in Queensland carried out a huge drugs bust on Wednesday and Thursday, seizing cannabis, meth amphetamines and prescription drugs from homes in Ipswich and Brisbane.

A video from one of the houses shows large amounts of cannabis in cardboard boxes laid out on the patio alongside equipment used to make drugs.

Officers arrested 49 people in total on a staggering 160 charges including trafficking, producing, supplying, possessing and receiving dangerous drugs and a range of stolen property offences.

A huge drugs bust in Queensland discovered cannabis, meth amphetamines and prescription drugs in homes in the Brisbane and Ipswich areas

The 57-year-old mother and her son allegedly ferried drugs from a house in Goodna, The Courier Mail reports.

'We will allege that the 12-year-old was delivering usable amounts of drugs to drug users,' said Acting Detective Inspector Gary Dixon of the Ipswich CIB.

'He effectively was like a delivery boy for the operation. I think the community of Queensland would be disgusted that somebody would use a child allegedly for the purposes of distributing drugs.'

Footage from the drugs bust also shows officers walking around the house, which has a large sound system inside and a disco ball in its living room.

Equipment used for making drugs and growing cannabis was found in one home raided by police

A packed garage is full of tools and chemicals, fans and insulation tubing to make drugs were laid out on the floor.

Operation Lima Quantity was first launched in November 2013 and investigations are continuing with more arrests anticipated.

Inspector Dixon said the operation, specifically targeting drug trafficking and supplying dangerous drugs, showed the commitment by the QPS to getting dangerous drugs out of circulation.

'The recovery of these drugs illustrates that the Queensland Police have no tolerance for illegal drugs in Queensland,' he said in a statement.

'Many officers have put in long, hard hours to make this operation a success, and we want this to act as a warning to anyone who thinks they can produce and sell drugs.

You will be caught and you will be charged if you are engaging in this behaviour in our community.'
