Police are hunting for any leads that could help solve the mysterious death of a young pregnant mother who was found shot in her car next to her injured daughter.

Authorities received a call saying a yellow Jeep Wrangler had crashed off the road in Ripley, Ohio and arrived to find the bullet-riddled body of Brittany Stykes, 22, inside.

She had been hit by two bullets, with the fatal shot puncturing her lungs. Her 14-month-old daughter Aubree was strapped in a car seat beside her suffering from a bullet graze to the head.

The little girl was rushed to hospital and is now speaking and breathing on her own. Photographs shared by her family show a large scar across her forehead where the bullet struck.

Tragic: Brittany Stykes, 22, was shot dead as she drove her car, while her daughter Aubree, pictured, suffered a wound to the head. Brittany was pregnant and her unborn child also died

Brittany, a married stay-at-home mother, was four months pregnant and her unborn child also died in the tragedy on August 28.

A week on and authorities are scrambling to find any clues that could reveal who shot the five bullets at Brittany's car as she made a routine journey home with her daughter.

More than a week after the death, no arrests have been made and the motive in the crime 'is still up in the air,' Chief Deputy John Schadle said at a news conference on Thursday.

'Obviously we're taking this as a very serious matter,' he said, adding that investigators were testing unspecified items found at the scene and trying to reconstruct the crime.

Recovering: Aubree's head was grazed by a bullet that shot her mother. She is improving every day, family said

'We hope this helps fill in some of the pieces of the puzzle.'

Preliminary autopsy results show that no gunpowder residue was found on Stykes' body, which suggests that the shots weren't fired at close range.

Brown County authorities said the 
bullets had been fired through the driver's side of the vehicle and 
passed through the passenger side. The bullet that grazed Aubree had passed through her mother.

A motorist had called 911 after spotting her yellow Jeep crashed on the highway. He pulled over and checked inside the vehicle, finding the dead mother and her crying toddler.

He assumed she had died in the impact of a crash, WCPO reported.

'There's a Jeep off the road in the 
woods. Looks like somebody drove off the road into the woods and they're
passed out at the wheel,' Craig Labell told a 911 dispatcher. 'Looks like a girl, female in her 20s or 30s.'

But police found Stykes hunched over the steering wheel. She had been shot with two bullets that had left three wounds on her body, authorities said.

David Dodson, Stykes' father and Aubree's grandfather, told The Associated Press on Thursday that he and his family are still baffled about why anyone would want to hurt his daughter and her children.

Stykes lived for her family and was loved by everyone who knew her, he said.

'She would call me every morning and it was always, "Dad, what are we going to do today?"' Dodson said, adding that she visited him every day while her husband worked his factory job in Cincinnati.

'She loved being a mom, that was her world right there â€“ the babies and being married,' he said. 'She wanted to be with us all the time.'

His daughter had just left her mother-in-law's house and was on her way home when she was shot, Dodson said.

He said Aubree is getting better every day and has been asking about her mother. But until he knows who killed Brittany and unborn grandchild, Dodson said that he'll be worried about Aubree's safety.

'If there's anyone who knows any information, I beg you, please come out and get a hold of the sheriff's department on this,' he said. 'We need answers.'

A $5,000 reward is being offered for information that leads to whoever was responsible.

'We're not going to leave any stone unturned to get justice for Brittany and her family,' Schadle said.
