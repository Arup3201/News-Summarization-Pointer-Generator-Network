A 'diva' Bichon Frise has almost 4,000 fans on Facebook after he was pictured dancing, skateboarding, playing football and even 'folding' the washing.

Fluffy pet Ozzie has been seen around the world thanks to the efforts of his owner Kayleigh Langdon, 26, who runs a dog grooming parlour in Torrington, Devon.

She set up his page, Ozzie Bichon, last year in a bid to share his antics online and her attention-loving dog has been pictured in more and more elaborate poses since.

Top dog! Every pet has its day - and today belongs to Ozzie the Bichon Frise, who has almost 4,000 likes on his own Facebook page. Ozzie's owner has encouraged her fluffy pet to skateboard and dance on camera

Ms Langdon has dressed Ozzie up in glasses, bow ties and Easter bunny ears, seated him at a laptop, encouraged him to dance and put a rose in his mouth. 

'Bichons are big characters,' she said. 'They love to be the centre of attention.

'They are definitely the clowns of the dog world and born entertainers.

'I decided to set up a Facebook page for Ozzie. I already filled my own page up with photos of him so thought it would make more sense for him to have his own page.

'People from all over the world follow him and look forward to his photos and trick videos.

'Ozzie has always been a diva so it's great that he finally has the fans to go with it.'

One particular skill that has attracted attention is Ozzie's skateboard antics - as long as he doesn't have to turn corners.

'Ozzie learned to skateboard several years ago when we attended trick training classes,' said his proud owner.

'He has never been a nervous dog when it comes to new things and took his own initiative.

'He will never get the steering down so he just goes at full speed and then waits to be turned around.'

'We can't help but spoil him,' Ozzie's owner said. 'He sleeps under the duvet next to me every night'

Hipster: Ozzie is unperturbed by the attention, whether he's in thick-rimmed glasses or facing a strong wind 

Ms Langdon said the spotless dog hates to get his paws dirty or wet and can be a 'little devil' at times.

She said: 'We can't help but spoil him. We take him on walks, we have playtime every evening and he sleeps under the duvet next to me every night.

'I hope he knows how loved he is.'

And his popularity is being put to good use - as the dog-lover has used Ozzie's popularity to launch campaigns for the local pet charities K9 Focus and Dogs Helping Kids.
