Freedom: Christopher Tappin, 65, leaves court after being held in custody for two months while he awaits trial

A retired British businessman extradited to the United States over arms dealing charges has been released on bail.

Christopher Tappin, 65, was freed after two months in custody following a ten-minute court hearing at the federal magistrates court in El Paso, Texas.

The millionaire, from Orpington, Kent, was forced to surrender his British passport to U.S. Marshals when he entered the country and must remain in Texas while he awaits his trial.

Under his bail conditions, he will live with Dan Cogdell, one of his lawyers, at his family home in Montgomery County, near Houston.

He must wear an electronic tag at all times and his travel will be limited to within two Texas counties as well as the border city of El Paso for court appearances.

‘If for some reason you fail to comply, you could be arrested and sent back to jail,’ Magistrate Judge Robert Castaneda warned.

Tappin, who uses a walking stick, faces up to 35 years in jail if convicted of trying to sell batteries for surface-to-air missiles to Iran. He denies the charges.

The former president of Kent Golf Union was extradited to the U.S. in February after losing a protracted legal battle before the High Court.

He has been held in Otero County Detention Centre – a maximum-security prison in the New Mexico desert which houses accused murderers – ever since and has appeared in court in a prison jumpsuit and walking in shackles.

He originally spent 23 hours a day locked up in isolation before being moved to a shared cell.

In contrast, Mr Cogdell’s home is a mansion which boasts its own pool, and is nestled inside a luxurious gated community.

The decision to release Tappin on bail pending his trial was made on Monday by Judge David Briones.

Overturning an earlier decision to keep him in custody until his trial got under way, he said: ‘He is an older gentleman with some health problems, a pillar in his community, and has a strong support system.’

Yesterday Tappin appeared in court wearing a dark green prison jumpsuit. One hand was free to use his walking stick, the other was handcuffed to his waist.

His bond was set at $1million (£620,000) and Judge Castaneda said Tappin had already posted the $50,000 (£31,000) to secure his release.

He told Tappin that he must meet with pre-trial services as soon as he arrived in Houston and get fitted with a GPS monitoring device to track his movements.

Earlier this week Tappin’s wife, Elaine, said: ‘We have not yet had the opportunity to speak to him but we are making arrangements to visit him as soon as we can.’

Tappin’s case has fuelled the row over the fairness of the extradition treaty between the UK and the US.

Attorney General Dominic Grieve QC said Tappin’s extradition highlighted problems with the treaty which were not ‘readily curable’, warning that many Britons were left uneasy when faced with the seemingly harsh and disproportionate sentences in the American justice system.

Other critics of the 2003 treaty, including Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, have deemed it ‘one-sided’.

In court, it emerged that the U.S. immigration and customs enforcement agency are holding Tappin’s passport as a piece of evidence and looking into the countries he has travelled to.

The grey-haired businessman left court after changing out of his prison clothes and into a shirt and trousers.

Asked how he was feeling, he said: ‘Very well thank-you.’

He described his time in prison as ‘tolerable’ and said the experience ‘got better’ after he was moved from isolation into a shared cell.

Asked whether he thought he had been treated unfairly, he said: ‘All I can say is I’m quite thankful to Judge Briones for granting me bail and I’m looking forward to putting my case to the court.’

Tappin said he was ‘excited’ about speaking to his wife, Elaine, and planned to phone her as soon as he could.

Asked what he was looking forward to most about being out of jail, he said: ‘I’m looking forward to a fish and chip dinner and sleeping in a comfortable bed.’

His lawyer, Mr Cogdell also said he planned to take him out for some traditional Texan barbecue food.

Tappin was expected to visit the ICE office to sign paperwork allowing him to stay in the US, before getting on a flight to Houston.
