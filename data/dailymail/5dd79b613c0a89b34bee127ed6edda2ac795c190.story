Luis Suarez has been handed the No 9 shirt at Barcelona and will be unveiled on Wednesday after joining the Catalan Giants from Liverpool in a £75million move from Liverpool.

The disgraced Uruguay striker, whose World Cup ended after he savagely bit Italy defender Giorgio Chiellini, will inherit the coveted squad number from Alexis Sanchez, who was sold to Arsenal to fund Suarez's move to the Nou Camp.

But fans hoping to see the traditional grand unveiling for stars joining Barca will be disappointed. While the likes of Zlatan Ibrahimovic, Cesc Fabregas, Alexis Sanchez and Neymar have all been paraded in front of thousands of adoring fans at the Nou Camp in recent years, Suarez will have to make do with a plain old conference room.

Disgrace: Suarez is banned for four months after biting Giorgio Chiellini at the World Cup

Talent: Suarez won both the PFA and Football Writers player of the year during a stellar last season

VIDEO Suarez appeal rejected 

This is because Suarez is banned from entering the Nou Camp stadium due to his four-month ban from all football activity imposed by FIFA following his bite on Chiellini. 

Instead of juggling footballs and posing with his family on the pitch, Suarez will smile for the cameras in a room called Auditorium 1899, which is near to the Nou Camp. 

Barcelona do their best to sell Auditorium 1899 as better than the average business facility, saying that it 'combines elegant wooden decoration with large format photographs of FC Barcelona players in action and several plasma screens dotted around the room.' However, whether it could be described as 'Mes que un conference room' is unlikely.

AND HERE'S WHERE SUAREZ WILL BE UNVEILED!

Auditorium 1899: The room where Suarez will be presented as a Barcelona player is functional not glamourous

February 2007: Makes his international debut for Uruguay against Colombia but is sent off in the final minutes after being shown a second yellow card for dissent.

November 2007: Joins Ajax from Uruguayan side Nacional but is later suspended by the Dutch giants after a half-time dressing-room altercation with team-mate Albert Luque.

July 2010: During the 2010 World Cup quarter-finals, Suarez prevents Ghana's Dominic Adiyiah from scoring in the final minute with a deliberate handball on the line and is subsequently sent off. A penalty was awarded but missed by Asamoah Gyan and footage showed Suarez celebrating on the sidelines. Uruguay eventually went through to the last four on penalties.

November 2010: Handed a seven-match ban by the Dutch FA and fined by his club for biting PSV Eindhoven midfielder Otman Bakkal during an Eredivisie match.

October 2011: Following his move to Liverpool in January 2011, is involved in a tackle with Everton's Jack Rodwell and goes down with apparent minimal contact. Rodwell is then sent off.

October 2011: Alleged to have racially abused Manchester United's Patrice Evra during a Premier League match. Later found guilty by an independent regulatory commission, banned for eight matches and fined £40,000.

December 2011: Seen making an offensive gesture towards Fulham fans. At this time he had already been charged by the FA over the racism incident, although not yet punished, but was handed a further one-match ban for the gesture.

February 2012: United and Liverpool meet again at Old Trafford and more controversy ensues as Suarez refuses to shake Evra's hand before kick-off.

October 2012: Celebrates a goal against Everton by diving in front of Toffees boss David Moyes, who had earlier claimed that "divers" such as Suarez were putting fans off the English game.

January 2013: Handles the ball prior to scoring Liverpool's winner in the FA Cup third-round tie at Mansfield.

April 2013: Bites Branislav Ivanovic on the arm but escapes punishment on the pitch as the referee fails to see it, and scores Liverpool's equaliser seven minutes into stoppage time as they draw 2-2 with Chelsea at Anfield. Fined by club the following day and charged with violent conduct by the FA. Subsequently handed a 10-match ban by an independent regulatory commission, which Liverpool opt not to appeal against.

June 2014: Television replays show Suarez moving his head towards Chiellini, who responded by swinging an arm before chasing the referee to apparently insist he had been bitten on his shoulder. Banned by FIFA from all football for four months, as well as nine international matches, and ordered to pay a fine of 100,000 Swiss francs.
