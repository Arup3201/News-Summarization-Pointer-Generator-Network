A 10-year-old boy is facing expulsion from school after teachers called the police when he brought in a fake orange gun for bring-a-toy session.

Little Jayden Taljaard took the model handgun - which does not fire or make a noise - to a regular Friday class where pupils can bring their own toys.

But staff called the police after three teachers reported feeling 'threatened' by the replica.

It emerged today that Jayden has been immediately suspended from Selwood Academy in Frome, Somerset, and has  been told he could be permanently excluded.

A police officer is due to visit the youngster at home to warn him of the dangers of firearms.

But Jayden's stepfather Kevin Pleasants said the schoolboy had made a simple mistake and the issue has been 'blown out of all proportion'.

The 56-year-old construction worker said: 'We were totally unaware that a bright orange toy gun that doesn't fire anything would cause so much mayhem.

'We have a policeman coming to the house to give him a lecture on the dangers of firearms - he's 10, it's ridiculous.

'It's being blown out of all proportion. We had no idea about the school's policy on toy guns. It's a simple mistake.

'He asked his mother if he could take a toy to school. She didn't let him at first. He explained about golden time and took the gun.

'Three teachers said they felt threatened by this gun. Could they not see it was bright orange and plastic?'

Jayden's school holds the so-called 'Golden Hour' sessions for the last hour of every Friday where pupils are allowed to bring in a toy of their choice.

But Jayden was suspended after taking in the replica weapon on February 27 and told not to return until Monday 9 March.

At meeting on Wednesday evening, his mother Natasha was then told his exclusion could be made permanent.

Jayden suffers from ADHD and other learning difficulties but was making good progress at the school since joining in September, according to his parents.

Mr Pleasants, from Frome, added: 'He was supposed to go back on Monday but my partner had a meeting at the school and they said he might not be allowed back.

'He was doing fine at the school. He brought an award home for very good behaviour. I framed it and it is on his wall.'

The school has brought in the police over the incident and officers will now talk to the 10-year-old boy

Selwood Academy has not commented on its threat to expel Jayden other than to say it will handle the issue 'internally'

Mr Pleasants added: 'My partner is devastated by this. She is in a state of depression. She feels like she has failed as a mother.

'I think that they can't handle Jayden and this is an excuse. We worked hard to find the right medication for him and we think we finally have. He was making progress.

'We received a letter saying he is not allowed out in public otherwise we might face prosecution because he is not in school.

'He has to stay in the house all day. It's like he is a prisoner in his own home. Natasha is an assistant nurse and she has had to take time off work.'

Headteacher Jean Hopegood said the school would be 'dealing with the matter internally'.
