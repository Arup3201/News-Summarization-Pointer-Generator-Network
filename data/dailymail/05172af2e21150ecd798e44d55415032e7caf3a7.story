Beatles legend Sir Paul McCartney will close out the Olympics Games opening ceremony with a performance of Hey Jude - and he'll ask the stadium's 60,000 spectators to sing along with him.

One billion people are expected to tune in to watch the spectacular three-hour show, which is being directed by Oscar winner Danny Boyle and is costing £27 million to produce.

The largest harmonically tuned bell in 
the world will ring to mark the start of the ceremony at 9pm on July 27 - and the pop legend will bring it to a rousing finale at midnight.

Work is well under way for the opening ceremony on July 27, which will be watched by a TV audience of 1 billion

McCartney prompted rumours Hey Jude 
was on his Olympics set list last month when he reportedly refused to 
perform the song at the Queen's Jubilee concert.

Sources now confirm to the Sunday Times the song will mark the end of the ceremony later this month.

They have also revealed a darker side
to Danny Boyle's Isles of Wonder spectacular - named after a line in 
Shakespeare's play The Tempest.

As well as a 'green and pleasant land' celebrating Britain's rolling fields and rural heritage - the show will include a 'History Parade' celebrating the NHS, immigration and protest movements, and shining a light on the country's darker past.

The Olympic Stadium will be crammed with 60,000 spectactors for the ceremony, whic will begin at 9pm with the ringing of largest harmonically tuned bell in the world

The green set will transform into a  bleak industrial landscape and performers will recreate the Jarrow march of 1936, when 200 men walked to London to protest poverty and unemployment in the north east.

There will also be a tribute to the suffragette movement, led by an actress portraying Emmeline Pankhust.

And
a celebration of Windrush of 1948, when West Indians sailed to Britain 
in search of a new life - played out to a calypso soundtrack.

Britain's National Health Service will also be honoured by a parade of real nurses pushing hospital beds around the arena.

Performers will pay tribute to the Beatles by dressing in outfits inspired by the Sgt Pepper album cover

And there's room in the show for a tribute to the Beatles, as performers dressed in Sgt Pepper-inspired military uniforms fill the inside of the stadium.

A detailed soundtrack will accompany each performance, changing as the 'History Parade' progresses to the present day, including an all-female urban dance group, who'll perform the background music as a group of BMX bikers recreate stunts.

One highlight is expected to be the appearance of five Olympic rings which will converge and burst into flames in a spectacular pyrotechnic display - before Sir Paul McCartney closes the event with a performance of Hey Jude.

There will be three final rehearsals 
for the opening ceremony in the Olympic stadium the week before the 
Games, featuring up to 60,000 people, including 900 schoolchildren.

The
volunteer performers are not being paid but will receive travel and 
food costs, and officials have sent out letters warning those taking 
part not to divulge any information about what they are doing.

Such is the pressure to get the ceremony
perfect that officials have warned that any children unable to make 
every practice session will be prevented from performing.

The opening ceremony, which will be 
attended by 60,000 spectactors inside Stratford's Olympic Stadium, 
including the Queen, is due to begin at 9pm on July 27.
