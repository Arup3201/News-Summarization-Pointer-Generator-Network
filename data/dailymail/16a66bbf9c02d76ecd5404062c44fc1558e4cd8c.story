A legally blind sailor completed an impressive 2,800 mile sail across the Pacific before crashing his boat on a reef when he made it safely to Hawaii.

John Berg of California has lived on his 40-foot boat named the Seaquel for the past 14 years, and doesn't have insurance for the vessel meaning he's also lost his home.

Berg and his crew set sail from the coast of Mexico on April 29 and arrived last week in Hawaiian waters.

Shipwreck: John Berg of California had just finished a 2,800 mile cross-Pacific sail when he crashed his 40-foot boat named the Seaquel off the Hawaiian coast

Vision troubles: Berg is legally blind and uses special equipment to help him navigate

After dropping off two crew members in Hilo, Berg and one female crew member began circling the island to make port in Kailua Kona.

But Berg's state-of-the-art navigational equipment failed him and he wandered into rough waters - slamming the Seaquel into coral not far from his destination.

'He wandered into the surf. It was navigational error. They got too close to the shore and the waves picked them up and threw them on the beach,' John Dour, who lives in Kailua Kona, told Hawaii News Now the day after the wreck.

Berg and the female crew member reportedly survived the wreck without injury, and tied themselves to each other to swim to shore in the dark.

'The guy was completely devastated. He lived on that boat for 14 years. You know he lost his home. Everything,' Dour said.

Berg had no insurance on his vessel, and the following morning he found the boat totally stripped of all its expensive equipment.

'They stole the bimini. They stole the winches. They stole the (steering) wheel off the boat,' Dour says.

Friends have described Berg as an accomplished sea man who sailed competitively with his high-tech equipment.

'All of his electronics talk to him. He gets email that talk to him so he didn't have to read anything,' friend John Harold said.

Homeless: Berg doesn't have insurance for his vessel. He has lived on it for 14 years meaning he has also lost his home

A salvage crew was hired by the Hawaiian government to get the boat out of the water last week

'He's one of the most knowledgeable people I've ever known,' he added.

The Department of Land and Natural Resources hirde a salvage company to remove the boat last week, and could hit Berg with fines for damaging the coral.
