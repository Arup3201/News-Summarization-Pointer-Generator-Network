Ann Walters, 61 (pictured at age 39), was found dead on her living room floor, 10 hours after she called NHS 111 for help

A distraught son found his mother dead on her living room floor nearly 10 hours after she phoned for medical help.

Ann Walters' call to the NHS 111 line was categorised as an emergency, passed to the 999 service and an ambulance was dispatched to her home.

The journey was estimated to take around seven minutes.

However, for reasons that remain unclear, the ambulance turned back when it was just four minutes away - under instruction from the NHS 999 service.

Mrs Walters, 61, had a hole in her heart and it is thought she died from died from heart failure.

Her son Lawrence Thorpe, 24, found his mother on the living room floor of her home in Portsmouth, Hampshire, at 6pm.

He checked her phone log and discovered she had called the NHS 111 line at 8.25am.

However no medical help arrived at his mother's home until an out-of-hours GP arrived at 8.30pm that evening. 

It remains unclear why the GP had been asked to attend, given that Mrs Walters' initial call had been passed to the emergency services.

And it is not known whether the GP was called by the NHS 111 service or the 999 service, however both are run by South Central Ambulance Services (SCAS) in the area.

SCAS said it had launched two investigations into the incident, which occurred on December 28 last year.

One investigation will focus on why the ambulance was sent back and the other on why it took so long for an out-of-hours GP to attend.

Mr Thorpe believes had the ambulance arrived at his mother's home, she could still be alive today.

He now wants to know why help was sent so late.

He said: 'Knowing there was an ambulance minutes away from reaching my mum, I believed it could have saved her life.

'Even if it was only for an hour so, my sister Felicity could have had a chance to say goodbye.'

Mr Thorpe continued: 'At about 8.30pm, an out-of-hours GP came to the house to see my mum.

'Obviously we told him what had happened and he said he had been called at 4.45pm.

'However, because of a high workload he said he couldn't get to her until 8.30pm.'

SCAS has said it does not know why an earlier ambulance was cancelled, but the phone operator involved has been suspended, according to Mr Thorpe.

He said: 'I'm infuriated that she called for help and that no help came.

'Instead I was left to find my mother dead, and my sister - who hadn't spoken to my mum for several years - was robbed of her chance to say goodbye.

'I want to share this story so that in future, others may not have to suffer a similar fate.

'At least that way, her possibly-preventable death will not be in vain.'

A SCAS spokesperson said: 'The original call was answered and correctly assessed by the NHS 111 service and was very quickly and appropriately passed to the 999 service given the nature of the call and the information given by the caller.

Felicity and Lawrence Thorpe, Mrs Walters' children, say they were 'robbed' of the chance to say goodbye to their mother (pictured here aged 23)

'A full investigation is currently underway focusing on all aspects of our response to this patient.

'South Central Ambulance Service NHS Foundation Trust takes our response to patients very seriously and we would like to apologise to the family for the distress caused as a result of this regrettable incident and would like to offer our sincere condolences.

'We are in contact with the patient's family so that we can fully address their concerns. 

'SCAS follows all internal policies and procedures in the handling of such cases.

'As this investigation is still ongoing we are unable to comment further at this time.'
