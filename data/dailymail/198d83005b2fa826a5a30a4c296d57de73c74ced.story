In hot water: Activists are calling on RNC leader Pat Rogers to step down following the release of an email he sent making incendiary comments about American Indians

Republican National Committee leader Pat Rogers has found himself in hot water after sending an email lambasting New Mexico Government Susana Martinez for dishonoring the memory of infamous Civil War General George Armstrong Custer by meeting with Native-Americans.

Custer is notorious for taking part in the muddled Indian Wars of the 1860s-1870s that took the lives of scores of members of the Cheyenne, Lakota and other tribes. He was killed at the Battle of the Little Bighorn in 1876.

‘The state is going to hell,’ Rogers, a GOP lobbyist and recent member of the RNC Executive Committee, wrote in a June 8 email to Martinez's staff.

‘Col. [Allen] Weh would not have dishonored Col. Custer in this manner,’ he went on to say, referring to the Republican candidate for governor who was defeated by Martinez in the 2010 election.

The email was obtained by Independent Source PAC and released by ProgressNow New Mexico, a liberal advocacy organization, which has called on Rogers to step down over his incendiary comments, Indian Country Today reported.

‘Such a blatantly racist statement against our native people is offensive from anyone, but to come from a national GOP leader and lobbyist for some of our country’s largest corporations is indefensible,’ Progress Now New Mexico’s executive director Pat Davis said in a statement.

Rogers is currently in Tampa, Florida, preparing for the Republican National Convection that is set to get under way on Tuesday after being delayed by a day due to Tropical Storm Isaac.

Martinez is expected to take the stage at the convention on Wednesday, delivering a prime time address after former secretary of state Condoleezza Rice and before the vice presidential nominee, Congressman Paul Ryan.

Historical connection: Rogers attacked Governor Martinez right, for dishonoring General George Armstrong Custer, left, notorious for his involvement in the Indian Wars, by meeting with Native-Americans

The email was sent to senior members of Martinez’s administration after the governor met with New Mexico’s Native-Americans in June.

Martinez, who is widely considered to be the rising star in the GOP, is required by law to attend the annual state-tribal leaders summit, according to Progress Now New Mexico.

‘These e-mails show the contempt and disrespect New Mexico’s Republican leadership has for our Native people,’ Davis added, saying that unless the organizations Rogers speaks for, including the RNC, dismiss him, the public should assume that they feel the same way.

ProgressNow New Mexico has posted an online tool that allows people to email RNC leaders and the corporate CEOs of Rogers’ law firm, Modrall Sperling, and lobbying clients to call for his ouster.

This is not the first time Rogers has found himself in trouble over emails.

Controversial: Former RNC Chairman Michael Steele was criticized in 2010 for using the racially incentive term 'honest injun'

In July, he was forced to step down from the board of the New Mexico Foundation for Open Government after he was criticized for using personal email accounts to contact state government officials.

Rogers was appointed to the GOP executive committee by former RNC Chairman Michael Steele, who faced a similar backlash in 2010 after he publicly used the term ‘honest injun,’ which Native-Americans find racially offensive.

The RNC and Rogers have not responded to requests for comment.
