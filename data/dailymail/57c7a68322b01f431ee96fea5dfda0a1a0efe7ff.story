As a ticket inspector Dean Shulton, pictured outside court, was expected to travel all over the network, hop on and off tube trains

A London Underground ticket inspector stole more than £90,000 in benefits over 18 years by claiming he could barely walk.

Dean Shulton, 48, from Streatham, south London, was employed by Transport For London throughout the period, during which he claimed he was paid at the highest rate in mobility and care allowances.

As a ticket inspector he was expected to travel all over the network, hop on and off tube trains - and was even licensed to descend on to the tracks in an emergency.

He first applied for disability living allowance on August 16 1994, stating
 that he could not walk 100 yards without becoming 'tired and breathless' and was prone to chest infections and suffered depression.

Prosecutor Miss Tamsin Ryder told the court: 'He said he constantly felt tired, was 
unable to walk, was very weak when trying to prepare food, he became 
tired when attempting to get dressed and said his legs felt like they 
weighed ten tons.'

A doctor approved the application and 
Shulton was awarded the highest rate of mobility benefit and the middle 
rate of care benefit, which he successfully appealed and began receiving
 the maximum for both.

Miss Ryder continued: 'This award meant he was virtually unable to walk.

'He said he could not get out of bed, needed help to go to the toilet and needed massages to get the feeling in his legs."

Shulton also said he needed a paid carer to help turn him in his bed at night.

Shulton pleaded guilty to obtaining 
property by deception from the Department of Work and Pensions (DWP) 
between June 8, 1995 and January 29, last year, namely Disability Living
 Allowance (DLA) totalling £93,485.35.

He was sentenced to 40 weeks in 
jail at Inner London Crown Court on Friday.

Judge Michael Wood QC said: 'This is a really serious class of offence because of the extended period of time.

'This has been going on year after year, claiming benefit on the basis of not being able to work while holding down a job.'

The fraudulent claims came to light when the DWP received intelligence that Shulton had been a revenue control inspector since the early 1990s. Investigators are thought to have questioned him shortly before January 2013.

Miss Ryder explained that this meant he had powers of prosecution on the trains and held a 'Safety Critical Licence' which assessed his mobility for the job.

London Underground were concerned about the number of sick days Shulton was taking and a doctor examined him on June 8, 1995. 

Miss Ryder said that after that examination he was deemed fit for duty and the doctor found him to be extremely well.

Shulton's lawyer said that her client did not effectively travel and check tickets and was instead based at Oval tube station, pictured, where he checked tickets at the barrier

When questioned by investigators from the Department of Work and Pensions, Shulton admitted he should not have been working.

Miss Ryder said: 'His discussed his illnesses and disabilities, but admitted he should not have been working and his condition had improved.

Shulton has sold his house, moved in with his parents, and promised to pay compensation in full within seven days.

He
 remains an employee of Transport for London, but is currently the 
subject of disciplinary proceedings, which he expects will end his 
career.

His
 lawyer Miss Joanne Cecil said: 'He spent considerable time on paperwork
 and administration and essentially had a desk-bound office job.

Shulton was sentenced to 40 weeks in jail at Inner London Crown Court, pictured, on Friday. He admitted to falsely claiming more than £90,000 in disability living allowance from August 1994 to January last year

'He did not effectively travel and check tickets and was based at Oval, where he checked tickets at the barrier.

'This claim was not fraudulent from the outset and even though his condition improved he could not be considered to be a well person.'

Judge Wood added: 'The dishonesty is to continue to get these benefits that were plainly for someone unable to work and he was in work.

He added: 'I accept you did suffer from significant disability and your symptoms did fluctuate. You behaved with tremendous realism once you were caught.'

A Transport For London spokesperson said: 'We take issues of this nature extremely seriously, disciplinary proceedings are taking place.'
