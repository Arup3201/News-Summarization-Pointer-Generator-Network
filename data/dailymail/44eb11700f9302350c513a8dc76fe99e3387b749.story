Seven years after the financial crisis that shook Wall Street and unleashed a wave of debt carnage, many American cities have never recovered.

America's once-proud industrial heartlands, once home to large middle-class communities, now lie practically in ruins, while areas that have always had problems with poverty face an ever-greater climb to prosperity.

In some, whole neighborhoods lie crumbling, foreclosed and vacant after the eviction of legions of subprime borrowers. In others, jobless rates have soared and incomes plummeted, leaving those left behind struggling to eke out a living. 

California-based online research group FindTheBest.com has now compiled a list of the U.S. cities with the biggest communities of poor people, ranked by the percentage of households making less than $25,000 a year. The data is from the the Five-Year American Community Survey, released in December by the U.S. Census Bureau.

1. Detroit, Michigan

Once an economic powerhouse thanks to its famous auto industry, Detroit's decline began long before the U.S. housing bubble burst as car makers fled to cheaper destinations overseas. Between 2000 and 2010 the city's population fell by 25 percent, changing its ranking from the nation's 10th-largest city to 18th. As a result, many neighborhoods now lie abandoned.

In 2013 the city declared bankruptcy, becoming the largest U.S. city ever to do so.

2. Milwaukee, Wisconsin

Milwaukee is another victim of America's shift to a post-industrial economy. Previously the workshop which made many of America's most-iconic products, including saddles, tractors and motors, Milwaukee's collapse has taken decades and is still taking it's toll on the city, where poverty rates soared close to 30 per cent in the throes of the past recession.  

3. Philadelphia, Pennsylvania

America's fifth-most populous city, and an iconic part of the nation's revolutionary history, Philadelphia began its economic decline in the 1950s, when industrial restructuring led to the loss of many middle-class jobs and a gradual exodus of nearly a quarter of its population. In recent years gentrification and a expanding tourist and service industries have led to some revitalization of the centre, but many parts remain desperately poor.

4. Memphis, Tennessee

With nearly half the city's children living below the poverty line, Memphis is one of the worst American cities to grow up in. But the economic fate of the city's people depends in large part on the colour of their skin: a report last year by Elena Delavega at the University of Memphis noted that nearly a third of blacks and almost half of Latinos in the city live below the poverty line, compared to just one in ten whites.

Even as overall poverty rates in the city declined last year, the rates among children and Latinos have increased, Ms Delavega reported. And the racial gap is widening: 'An interesting observation is that poverty rates among non-Hispanic Whites are now much lower in Memphis and Shelby County than in the state or the nation as a whole,' Dr Delavega wrote.

5. Tucson, Arizona

Tucson was hard particularly hard by the Great Recession, with jobless rates almost tripling between 2007 and 2010, according to Arizona state government data. Between 2007 and 2011 poverty rates rose nearly 8 percentage points to 26.6 percent, well above the 15.3 percent national average. 

6. Baltimore, Maryland

With one in ten of working age people unemployed, a high cost of living and a low growth rate, Baltimore has become one of the hardest cities to survive in. Susan Roll, professor at the University of Maryland School of Social Work, told the Baltimore Sun several years ago that working poor are 'everywhere' in the city.

'They're not just people living in shelters,' she said. 'They're the person who poured your coffee. ... They're cleaning your office when you're not there.'

7. Fresno, California

Essentially a massive farming town, Fresno has always been dependent on low-paying agricultural labour. Just one in five of people over 25 have a college degree, while nearly a quarter never even finished high school. That means massive disparity between the haves and the have-nots.

'If you own a farm, you're apt to earn more wealth, while if you're a farm worker, your don't earn very much,' said Caroline Farrell, executive director of the Center on Race, Poverty & the Environment in an Associated Press interview in 2012. At that time, Fresno had the second highest poverty rates in the whole United States.

8. El Paso, Texas

A city of migrants, seven in 10 of El Paso citizens over five speak a language other than English at home, reports the U.S. Census Bureau, while one in four were born overseas. More than 20 per cent of peope live in poverty.

9. Indianapolis, Indiana

Another city battered by the financial crisis, the number of children living in poverty in Indianapolis has soared by more than 40percent since 2005, reports the Annie E. Casey Foundation. Meanwhile, social mobility statistics render the American Dream a joke for many people in the city, with just a 4.9percent chance that a person born into the poorest fifth of the income distribution will make it into the richest fifth.

10. Boston, Massachusetts

Although close to half the city's working-age adults have a college degree, Boston has a poverty rate well above the national average - a situation that has only become worse in many of the city's poorest neighborhoods. It is the fourth-most unequal big city in the whole of the US, with the richest 5percent earning more than 15 times the income of the poorest fifth.

Low wages blight Boston's economy, with 41 per cent of its people earning below a University of Massachusetts'  low-wage definition of $30,600 a year - mostly those in retail, health and social care and education.
