One of Colonel Gaddafi’s henchmen secretly squirrelled away ‘stolen’ Libyan money by buying a stake in an upmarket British estate agents, it was claimed yesterday.

Ali Dabaiba, once a close aide of the toppled tyrant, purchased shares in Chesterton Humberts as revolution engulfed the troubled North African country.

Amid the chaos of the Arab Spring, the 68-year-old is accused of shifting some of his family’s vast wealth - thought to run into millions of pounds - into the London property market.

Ali Dabaiba, seen at left with his son Osama, ran a Libyan state contracting agency for years but turned against Gadhafi during the revolution that overthrew and killed the ruler. It is claimed he squirrelled away 'stolen' Libyan money by buying a stake in an upmarket British estate agents, it was claimed yesterday

He was described as a ‘co-conspirator’ who invested in the high-class property firm - which has sponsored polo tournaments - in documents sent to the UK’s National Crime Agency, it has been claimed.

The Libyan government is trying to claw back billions of pounds wrongly funnelled out of the strife-ridden country by Gaddafi’s former associates as the regime collapsed. The dictator was overthrown and killed in October 2011.

Libyan Attorney General Abdulqader Radwan told the Wall Street Journal newspaper, which investigated the wealth transfer, that Mr Dabaiba was among those being investigated on suspicion of embezzlement and abuse of office.

A document sent to the UK by investigators working for the Libyans said: ‘The state of Libya believes that the estate agency Chesterton Humberts is part-owned by Ali Ibrahim Dabaiba or his brother or sons.’

In February, General Radwan sent a letter to Scottish authorities asking for help recovering ‘Libyan state assets stolen by Ali Ibrahim Dabaiba and concealed abroad with the help of his family members and others,’ according to the Wall Street Journal.

After Tony Blair offered the ‘hand of friendship’ to Libya in 2004, the tyrant and his aides looked for investment opportunities overseas, favouring London because of the ease of doing business and tax system.

Mr Dadaiba - part of Gaddafi’s inner circle known as ‘Companions of the Leader’ - became involved in Chesterton Humberts through businessman Salah Mussa, whose family fled Libya in 1967 before Gaddafi seized power.

In the mid-2000s, Mr Mussa, whose father was communications minister for King Idris, bought two UK property firms for at least £7.2million and merged them to form Chesterton Humberts.

After international sanctions were lifted on L ibya in 2008, Mr Mussa - who drove around in a chauffeured black Rolls Royce - looked for business opportunities in his homeland.

Meanwhile, Mr Dadaiba was running Libya’s powerful Organization for Development of Administrative Centers, or ODAC, which built and controlled vast infrastructure projects in Libya including airports, conference centres and universities.

Auditors who examined the OADC’s books after the regime fell found a string of questionable financial decisions, including kickbacks and loans to Mr Dabaiba’s friends and associates totalling around £24million, it was claimed.

By February 2011, Mr Mussa reached a deal with London representatives of the Dabaiba family to give them a stake in Chesterton Humberts’ holding company Chesterton Global, sources said.

It is claimed that at a meeting with a London-based QC working for the Libyan government in a Starbucks coffee shop, former Chesterton Humberts board member Tarek Al-Sayed said he had arranged for a sale of the estate agents’ shares from Mr Mussa to Mr Dabaiba’s family.

Chesterton Humberts, which has roots dating back to 1805, helped the Libyan Investment Authority - a sovereign wealth fund set up by Gaddafi to spend the country’s petro-dollars - by 14 Cornhill, a building opposite the Bank of England, in 2008.

Mr Dabaiba, who lives in Libya, has not been charged with any crimes. Neither have his family.

The National Crime Agency declined to comment.

Chesterton Humberts said in a statement: ‘We are aware of the recent article printed by the Wall Street Journal concerning Chesterton Humberts and its links with a prominent Libyan family.

‘We can confirm that we have no existing links or relationships with this family and they are not shareholders of Chesterton Global Ltd, Chesterton Humberts’ holding company.

‘The management and shareholders of Chesterton Humberts are not aware of any UK Government investigation into the ownership of Chesterton Humberts and can confirm that we have not been approached by the Libyan government or any other law-enforcement agency. If contacted, we would of course cooperate fully with their investigations.’

After issuing the statement, Chesterton Humberts did not respond to messages asking to discuss whether Mr Dabaiba had ever held shares in the company.
