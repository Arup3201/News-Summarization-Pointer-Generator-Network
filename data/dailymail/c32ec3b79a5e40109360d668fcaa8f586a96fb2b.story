Sheriff Alan Miller told Glasgow Sheriff's Court that he would adjourn a criminal trial because he had tickets to the Commonwealth Games

A judge adjourned a criminal trial of a police officer accused of assaulting his partner because he had tickets for the Commonwealth Games.

Sheriff Alan Miller told Glasgow Sheriff's Court that he was adjourning proceedings on Wednesday after both the prosecution and defence had finished their cases. 

Under Scottish judicial rules the Sheriff had to sum up both cases and then issue his verdict. 

The case is expected to resume today. 

Sheriff Miller adjourned proceedings at 3.50pm as he had tickets for the 6.30pm athletics session, even though the Hampden Park venue was only a ten minute drive away. 

Wednesday's main event featured Kenya's David Rudisha scoop gold in the men's 800 metres. 

A spokesperson for the Judicial Office for Scotland said: 'Shortly before 4pm, at the close of evidence, all parties agreed it would be an appropriate point to adjourn. 

'Sheriff Miller had an engagement at the Commonwealth Games.' 

However, Scottish Conservative justice spokeswoman Margaret Mitchell criticised the decision to adjourn the case to go to the sporting event. 

She told The Sun: 'Valuable court time has been wasted.' 

The Taxpayers' Alliance added: 'Justice shouldn't wait because a judge had tickets to the Commonwealth Games.' 

Sheriff Miller was appointed to the bench full-time on May 6, 2010 having served part-time for five years to the £128,000-a-year role.
