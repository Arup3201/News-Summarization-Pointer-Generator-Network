This incredible image that looks straight out of Star Wars shows how smoke from a raging marsh fire in New Orleans has surrounded the iconic Superdome, as an emergency is declared in the city.

Helicopters are dropping water from 500-gallon baskets, hundreds of acres of land have been burned and now a second marsh fire has started in what is turning into a city-wide disaster.

New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu spotted a second marsh fire during a flight over one that has hazed the metro area with smoke for three days and he has now declared an emergency.

Four helicopters based in Hammond were 
dropping water from the huge baskets onto the fire and five based in 
Pineville would join them on Wednesday, a Louisiana National Guard 
spokesman said.

Haze from the fire was reported as far west as the Baton Rouge metro area. The National Weather Service expanded its smoke alert from New Orleans and six suburban parishes to 23 parishes.

As of Tuesday morning, the original fire had burned all but about 537 acres - about eight-tenths of a square mile - of the trees, shrubs and grass on a 1,553-acre area surrounded by canals.

It started in the centre of the area and has been spreading outward, with the smoke alert now covering towns 100 miles from New Orleans.

‘It would take an armada of helicopters’
to drop water on it and douse it,' said state Democrat Representative 
Austin Badon Jr, who flew over the fires separately from Mayor Landrieu.

down that soil'

Each basket of water, when it hits earth, only covers an area about the size of a pickup truck.

Along the East Coast, 40 hot spots in the Great Dismal Swamp were still smouldering even after Hurricane Irene dumped 10 to 15 inches of rain on the area, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service said.

That fire that lightning started on August 4 has burned more than 6,000 acres in southeastern Virginia and northeastern North Carolina.

Some New Orleans schools had cancelled outdoor activities because of smoke which has spread across the metropolitan area for three days.

Meteorologists expected the smoke to move north over Lake Pontchartrain by evening, but to settle over the metro area again overnight.

A Louisiana Department of Agriculture and Forestry spokesman said the larger fire was likely to burn itself out by Wednesday afternoon, but Mayor Landrieu said it could take two days.

However it could keep burning underground - and that’s what is really concerning emergency services.

‘Once it's underground, it's next to impossible to fight,’ said Bret Lane, the top firefighter for the state's agriculture department. ‘You can't bring enough water to wet down that soil.’

The emergency department at the Interim 
LSU Public Hospital, which usually treats four or five patients a day 
for asthma, treated 24 patients with breathing problems in 24 hours.

But it's not clear if all were because of the smoke, a spokesman said. Those with breathing problems have been urged to stay inside in the air conditioning.

Jasmine Groves, who lives less than four miles from the New Orleans fire, said there was little smoke around her house on Tuesday.

So she did not bring her asthma inhaler into the central business district for a class on Tuesday, only to have to deal with heavy smoke 10 miles from the fire.

‘This is making breathing so hard,’ she said. Even after her class was over, she said, ‘I'm still tasting it in my mouth.’
