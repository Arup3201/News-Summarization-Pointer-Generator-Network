It just wouldn't be Christmas without turkey, tinsel and top politicians' desperately trying to say something about themselves with their official festive cards.

Once again we have David Cameron posing outside Number 10 and Ed Miliband posing with his children.

But Nick Clegg - not used to winning much these days - must surely be judged to have the best card this year, posing in a Santa hat in a series of photobooth snaps with wife Miriam in a festive jumper.

Each year the leaders' cards are carefully scrutinised to see what message they are trying to convey to voters.

This year is especially important, with just five months to go until the general election.

Mr Clegg, who in the past has asked his three sons to design his card, has chosen an offbeat series of passport photo-style images with his wife.

The couple are shown in four shots, with the Deputy Prime Minister donning a Santa hat before holding up a sign saying 'Merry Christmas!'.

By contrast, Mr Cameron has once again opted for a picture with his wife Samantha outside the door to Number 10.

They are seen posing in Downing Street with Chelsea Pensioners before hosting a reception for the war veterans held in July.

Mr Miliband, who hopes to take the keys of Number 10 in May next year, again chooses an informal portrait of his family, with wife Justine and their sons Daniel, aged 5,  Sam, 4.

They are seen making Christmas cards at their home in North London. 

It is not easy to get these things right. When Tony Blair's card was released this week, it was met with ridicule.

The picture, which was shared online, provoked widespread mirth for the awkwardness of their pose, the lack of festive cheer and most bizarrely of all Mr Blair's teeth.

In the photo, Cherie appears to have attempted to portray a softer look, wearing a scooped neck red dress and matching ruby accessories she leans into her husband, resting one hand on his chest.

But Tony obviously didn't get that message, his smile appearing to have been held frozen for too long in the glare of the camera and turned into a rather aggressive grimace.

Critics also noted his apparently un-ironed open necked shirt.
