A mother who has overcome agoraphobia after shedding 5st 6lb has celebrated her new-found confidence by posing for pictures in her underwear.

Diane Bryan, 49, from Sheffield, decided to show off her size 12 figure in a racy photo shoot for her husband, Stan. 

It's something she would never have dreamed of doing when she was a size 20. She was so ashamed of her figure then, she developed a fear of leaving the house.

Body confident: Diane Bryan is happy to pose in her underwear now she's a size 12

Gift: The mother-of-two posed for the racy shots for her husband to celebrate her 5st weightloss

Diane said: 'I used to be so embarrassed by my weight I wouldn't even let Stan see me getting undressed at night - I'd make him turn the lights off. But now I couldn't be happier with my figure.'

The mother-of-two gained weight after she moved from her hometown of Southampton to Sheffield, for husband's job with the Royal Navy.

'When we moved away from my family, I lost my support network and Stan was working away a lot. So I began living like a pig and surviving on massive takeaways,' she said.

Weight gain: Diane rose to size 20 after she moved to Sheffield with husband Stan and developed agoraphobia

She dropped to a size 12 after following an extreme diet plan but now eats healthily to maintain her shape

Diane admitted that she struggled to make friends when they moved so she stayed in scoffing ice cream and crisps.

She added: 'I used to phone for a takeaway that often my local pizza place knew my order before I'd even told them what I wanted.'

Her size 12 ballooned to a size 20 and this made it even more difficult for her to settle in their new area as she became too embarrassed about her size to socialise.

She said her shame over her appearance made her feel unable to leave the house and she found talking to strangers a painful and distressing experience. 

Feeling fab at 49: Diane said she's now full of confidence

Drink: Coffee with milk and sugar

Her weight then began to take its toll on her relationship with Stan, as well as on her health. 

She felt out of breath going up the stairs and doing day to day chores.

It was only when her doctor advised her to sign up for the Cambridge Weight Plan - an extreme diet that consists of only liquid food for the first 12 weeks - that she decided to beat the bulge once and for all.

Thanks to her diet she lost three stone in 16 weeks and went from 15st 11lbs to 10st 5lbs.

And as the pounds dropped away, so did her agoraphobia.

Diane is now recovered enough to go out alone and live an active  life and has swapped the junk food for a healthy diet of veg and lean meat.

She even felt confident enough to produce a calendar of underwear snaps for her husband.

Diane said: 'Since dropping my extra weight it has been the biggest confidence boost of my life. It's helped me overcome the extreme agoraphobia that I had and I can live a normal life.

'I feel absolutely incredible - who knew you could feel this good at 49!'
