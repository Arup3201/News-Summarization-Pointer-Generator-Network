Suspect: Police say Eh Lar Doh Htoo, 18, stabbed three young brothers to death with a machete

Three young brothers aged 1, 5 and 12 were stabbed to death and two other family members were hurt in an attack at a home in eastern North Carolina.

Officers were called to a report of a person with a 'machete-like' knife around 11pm Tuesday and took a suspect into custody, New Bern Police Lt. Ronda Allen said.

The officers entered the home and found two dead boys along with one still-breathing brother.

They then subdued and arrested 18-year-old neighbor 18-year-old Eh Lar Doh Htoo, who they found still at the scene.

The third boy was taken to a North Carolina East hospital, where he died.

Their mother and 14-year-old sister were also injured in the stabbing. Allen said they had been treated and released.

The father was at work when the horrific attack occurred, police said. 

'He's crazy,' neighbor Ner Wah said Wednesday. 'I told my wife: 'Be careful. Don't answer the door.'' 

The victims were Burmese and had entered the United States via Thailand, according to New Bern Police Chief Toussaint Summers, Jr.

New Bern is a coastal town and home to about 1,900 Burmese refugees, who resettled in the area after fleeing persecution from the country once called Burma.

'Anytime this happens in any community, any part of town, it's surprising,' the police chief said.

The stabbings happened on a street of about 10 row-like homes that face a railroad track and several dilapidated commercial buildings.  

The mother jumped out the second-floor window of her home after she was attacked, according to neighbor A Lay, who was awakened when she knocked on his door. Her back was bloody.

'She said she needed help and she needed the police,' said A Lay's wife, A Bu.

Police did not release the victims' names.

Triple homicide: Police arrived to the home around 11pm Tuesday to find two of the boys dead. A third died at a hospital while their sister and mother survived the gruesome attack and were released from the hospital

Wah said that like him, Htoo was a member of the Karen ethnic group, an oppressed people whose language has been banned back home.

Htoo once came to Wah's house during the day to ask him to help translate documents, but Wah said they weren't friends.

'We felt very scared of him,' Wah said.

Susan Husson, executive director of the Interfaith Refugee Ministry in New Bern, said the victims' family and the suspect's family likely came through her office before settling in New Bern, but she didn't know them personally.

She said the first Burmese refugee came to New Bern around 1999.

'It's just really hard right now,' she said. 'It's been really horrific.'

A neighbor who lives about five houses away said he heard sirens late Tuesday night and decided to stay inside.

'We were scared. We just locked the door,' said 23-year-old Yyoch Rmah, who moved to the U.S. from Vietnam in 2006.

He said there were a lot of Burmese refugees in the neighborhood, and people from other countries.

Htoo's first court appearance was scheduled for Friday. 

Chief Summers told WITN the Htoo is now charged with assault with a deadly weapon and intent to kill inflicting serious injury.

The suspect and the victims knew each other, although the suspect was not a member of the victims' family, Allen said. 

Allen did not release any potential motive in the stabbings. She said police planned to release more information about the stabbing later Wednesday.

But, Chief Summers said, 'This wasn't a random event.' 

Other charges were also pending against Htoo. He was being held Wednesday on $1 million bond. 

He was slated to first appear before a judge the morning of March 19. 

The State Bureau of Investigation was assisting New Bern police.
