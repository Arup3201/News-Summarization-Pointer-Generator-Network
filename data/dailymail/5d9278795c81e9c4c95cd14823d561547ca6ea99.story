A Sydney woman who suffered permanent brain damage after being hit by a car while walking with her newborn baby has settled her bid for damages out of court.

Emma De Silva irrecoverably changed when she was hit by Bryce James Wayland in March 2011 and was left in a coma for two months.

She was pushing her 19-day-old daughter Eloise in a pram in St Peters in Sydney's inner west when she was hit by the car.

While Mr Wayland avoided jail after he told the court the accelerator of his vehicle became stuck under a floor mat, the accident broke down Ms De Silva's marriage and left her in the care of her father Keith Freeman.

Bryce Wayland avoided jail after he told the court the accelerator of his vehicle became stuck under a floor mat

The 40-year-old launched a bid against the insurance company in the NSW District Court, seeking damages, including the loss of future earnings.

On Tuesday the claim settled out of court with the judge due to give it approval on Wednesday.

Ms De Silva's father said he was 'very pleased' with the outcome, The Sydney Morning Herald reports.

'The first thing we hope to do is to get her sorted out and in a house,' Mr Freeman said.

'Hopefully she'll be able to live reasonably without too much problems.'

It comes two years after the driver Wayland was was sentenced to 50 hours of community service in February 2013 over the crash.

He had told the court the accelerator pedal of his Lexus sedan was caught under the floormat and he swerved to avoid a bus before mounting the kerb and hitting the mother and baby.

Speaking after the sentence was handed down, Ms De Silva's father Keith Freeman said his daughter's life was now 'completely different' to the one she had when the accident occurred.

'Emma was at the height of happiness,' Mr Freeman said. 

'She had just had a baby, she had a husband she adored and they had just renovated their house in St Peters and everything was perfect for her... It lasted exactly 19 days.'

The once A-grade squash player once had dreams of having more children and becoming principal of the school where she taught. 

After she woke up from her coma, Ms De Silva spent a further year at Royal Rehabilitation Hospital in Ryde.

Her marriage has since ended and she has suffered permanent brain injuries. 

Her daughter Eloise, who is turning four this year, escaped serious injury from the accident.

In a recent post on the Emma De Silva Foundation Facebook page, photos of the mother and daughter were uploaded along with an update on Ms De Silva's condition.

'Em is doing well. She has been in her own place for close to 12 months and loves it. She has many amazing carers giving her round the clock care, helping her cook meals and general life skills,' the Facebook post reads.

'Her speech is slightly better, some days it's harder to understand than others but her physical improvement are fantastic. 

'Em aims to walk her beautiful sister down the aisle next year and fingers crossed it will happen. She walks with a frame but can stand on her own for a little bit and bend down keeping her balance.

'Em still has good days and bad and finds it hard to get motivated at times but loves her time with Eloise and is a great mum.'
