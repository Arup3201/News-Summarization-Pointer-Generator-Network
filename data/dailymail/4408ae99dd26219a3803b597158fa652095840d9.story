Killer instincts? Lacey Spears, 26, is pictured with her 5-year-old son Garnett (right) who she's now accused of killing

A New York State mom blogger who gained a widespread following with posts about her son's near-constant health problems could soon be charged in the 5-year-old's suspicious January death.

Authorities in Westchester County almost immediately looked to Lacey Spears when her son Garnett died and have since determined the boy died from acute sodium poisoning.

Now, a source close to the investigation has revealed that the 26-year-old southern transplant could soon find herself in a New York jail as authorities prepare to press charges in what they've deemed a homicide.

'It's evident by the nature of what was found in his body that somebody, in effect, poisoned him,' the source told FoxNews.com. 'He died at the hands of somebody else.'

Should Spears be charged, it will be the culmination of months of speculation over her involvement in the death, the state of her mental health and of her possible motivations.

Spears could potentially get charged with anything from murder to negligent homicide or manslaughter.

Since her son's death, Spears has fled New York, where the Alabama native lived in a 'fellowship community' of back-to-the-land types, for Kentucky.

Her attorney David Sachs denied his client had anything to do with her son's death.

'Lacey is completely devastated by the loss of her son and absolutely denies harming her son in any way,' Sachs told FoxNews.com

Agonizing: The boy died from acute sodium intoxication days after he was rushed to a Westchester County, New York hospital complaining of severe stomach pains

Garnett Spears died at Westchester 
Medical Center in January after Spears rushed him to the emergency room 
on suffering intense abdominal pains from what appeared to be a stomach 
virus.

The little boy's condition worsened and he died four days later with what appeared to be dangerously high amounts of sodium in his system - leading investigators to question whether Garnett was deliberately given the salt.

Indeed, before he tragically passed away, hospital officials told police that the levels were suspiciously high - which caused the investigation to be opened into the Chestnut Ridge mother.

Following this, police sought and obtained a search warrant for her home in mid-January.

Suspicious: A neighbor claims Spears asked that he hide one of the many feeding tube bags that she used--unnecessarily many say--to feed Garnett as he lay dying in January

They took food from her home, her cell phone and computer. They have also questioned Lacey Spears' friends and family and obtained Garnett's past medical records after discovering that he had been hospitalized 23-times during his short life.

As the investigation continued, a neighbor who asked not to be named told USA Today that as Spears' son lay dying she asked her to go to her home and dispose of one of the boy's feeding bags - which allegedly contained a large amount of sodium.

Police have not released why Garnett 
had a feeding tube - believed to be in his abdomen - but have pointed to
 his history of illness and repeated hospital visits.

The
 neighbor who asked not to be named said that they did initially remove 
the bag - but then phoned the police and turned it over when they heard 
about the circumstances surrounding the boys death.

Those circumstances, it became clear all too late, were nothing new.

The
 same questionable parenting and suggestions of the child-harming mental
 illness Munchhausen by proxy surrounded Garnett and his mom starting 
from just after the boy was born and across the states of Alabama, 
Florida and New York.

The
 Florida Department of Children and Families revealed in April that 
they've had a file on Spears since 2011, when an anonymous call voicing 
concerns about her parenting was made to their abuse hotline.

And
 prior to that, in 2009 while the family lived in Alabama, Garnett 
suffered severe seizures and had to be flown by helicopter to a Decatur 
hospital and resuscitated.

The
 Journal News reported last month that the Florida agency is sharing all
 information they have on the mother with New York authorities.

Sad: Garnett was hospitalized more than 23 times during his five years of life and his mother Lacey updated social media to update her followers on her sons progress

Munchausen by proxy, is a psychiatric disorder which makes a parent purposely hurt their child — to get attention.

'It is so counter-intuitive to all our ideas of what parenthood is supposed to be,' said Dr. Marc D. Feldman who has written extensively about Munchausen syndrome.

'But medical child abuse can and does occur.'

Feldmen told USA Today that this case has at least four distinct red-flags for him that indicate the possibility of abuse.

1) Garnett had a feeding tube for unknown reasons. In case of Munchausen by proxy the child will be sick enough to have a feeding tube or intravenous line that gives the abuser access to the body internally.

'That's an avenue for medical chaos,' Feldman said. 'A feeding tube is a real red flag.'

2) It is almost physically impossible to ingest or force feed a lethal does of salt. However, introducing it over time through a feeding tube is possible.

3) Feldman points out that those with Munchausen often exhibit pseudologia fantastica — compulsive lying - Spears told lies about her partner and about being a mother

4) Exaggerated stories of their child being ill is another symptom - and in this case Spears obsessively detailed her child's illnesses online

People with the condition also have borderline personality disorder, a psychiatric condition marked by problems with impulsive and reckless behavior, leading to unstable relationships.
