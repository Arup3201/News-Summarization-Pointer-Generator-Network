A one-of-a-kind Aston Martin, built especially to cater to a Scottish laird's passion for fishing, is going on sale next week.

The wealthy landowner commissioned the renowned British car company to make a special model of his favourite car so that it could accommodate his piscatorial tools.

The result was the only Aston Martin DBS Estate in existence.

The unique car has a bigger back and carried many a sizeable salmon catch during its years of service to the former unnamed owner.

Coach-builders at the prestigious British car makers knocked up the only Aston Martin DBS Estate in existence

He bought the then ruby vehicle in 1971 and used it for fishing trips in the Scottish Highlands until he sold the extended automatic car in 1975 to the latest recipient, who is now selling it at auction after 36 years.

The current, elderly vendor, from north-east England, had the Aston Martin sprayed blue and used it as a second car for family holidays and days out.

Despite its age, the motor has only done 70,000 miles and passed its MoT with flying colours just two weeks ago.

The current owner painted the red car and is now selling it after 36 years of faithful service as a leisure mobile

The boot of the car was enlarged to fit both the equipment and the catch and carried many a salmon caught by the Scottish gentry man

The car is being sold by auctioneers Bonhams with a pre-sale estimate of £70,000.

Tim Schofield, director of Bonhams' Motor Car department, said: 'This is a true one-off car that was commissioned for practical purposes.

'It has been with the current owner for the majority of its life. I think he is a man of advancing years and he has had his fun out of it and it is now time to pass it on to somebody else.'

What it normally looked like: The 55th Motor Show at Earls Court in 1970, showcasing an Aston Martin DBS V8 with models Jenny Lowe (L) and Carol Craig sitting on the bonnet

'It has always been used as a second car in the household for high days and holidays.'

Mr Schofield added: 'Looking at it head on, it looks just like a six cylinder Aston Martin DBS and it is only when you look at it side on and from the rear you see it looks totally different.'

'The car has still retained its famous "Coke bottle" wing line shape and is seamless in appearance.

'The car was ordered new by a Scottish laird who wanted a car to use for fishing trips that could accommodate his fishing gear and with a bit of luck a sizeable catch'

'He had a leaping salmon mascot fixed to the bonnet but that is sadly long gone.'

Aston Martin converted numerous DB5 and DB6 chassis into estate cars but this one is the only DBS Estate in the world.

Inside, the tan leather seats at the back fold flat to create a huge space for luggage.

The auction takes place in Newport Pagnell, Buckinghamshire, on May 19.

Handy: The roof rack was used by the first owner to keep all the fishing gear in place during many visits to the coast to catch fish

Making a profit: The saloon which has had two previous owners is being sold after last exchanging hands in 1975
