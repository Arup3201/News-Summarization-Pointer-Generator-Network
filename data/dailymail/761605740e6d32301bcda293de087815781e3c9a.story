The head of mathematics at a Catholic secondary school has quit his job after calling pupils 'b********' and 'Fkrs' on Facebook.

The former maths teacher, who taught at Cardinal Wiseman Technology College in Birmingham, posted an angry message on the social networking site after discovering teenage pupils had viewed his profile.

The Facebook rant led to calls from furious parents for the teacher to be sacked, with Birmingham City Council now confirming that the teacher had left his post voluntarily.

Upon learning that pupils had discovered his Facebook page and had been viewing pictures he had uploaded, the teacher said he had been forced to change his profile image to retain anonymity.

In an angry message post, he said: 'B****** students looking at my profile pic so I changed into my figure out how to hide it!!! Fkrs!'.

Shortly after the message was posted, parents of pupils at the school branded the message 'abusive' and demanded the teacher be sacked.

It is not yet known how the teacher's Facebook post came to the attention of the parents.

A spokeswoman for Birmingham City Council has now confirmed that the maths teacher resigned from his post asÂ head of mathematics at Cardinal Wiseman Technology College yesterday morning.

In a statement released later, Cardinal Wiseman's headteacher Christina Stewardson said: 'This matter was brought to my attention 
by a number of pupils and their teachers on Monday and has been dealt 
with by myself and the governors.'

'I apologise unreservedly for the poor judgment exercised by a member of staff and have assured parents that this behaviour does not reflect the high professional standards by which the rest of the staff here conduct themselves,' she added.

The school's website features a message reading: 'Each individual member of our community is worthy of a profound and unique respect so we promote the highest expectations of conduct.'

Ofsted inspectors visited the 600-pupil mixed sex school more than a year ago and lowered its rating from 'satisfactory' to 'requires improvement'.

While pupil behaviour was rated as 'good', Ofsted said teaching needed 'improving'.

The report said: 'Leadership and management require improvement because neither teaching nor achievement are good.'
