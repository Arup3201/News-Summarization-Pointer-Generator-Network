Manuel Pellegrini insists he is not feeling the pressure at Manchester City despite his team’s faltering form and the prospect of finishing this season empty handed.

City are understood to be monitoring the progress of Diego Simeone at Atletico Madrid should they decide to make a change and part company with Pellegrini in the summer.

The Premier League champions have slipped seven points behind Chelsea in the title race ahead of Wednesday’s trip to Stoke, and have failed to win any of their last five game in all competitions. It represents City’s worst run since late 2009 when current Stoke boss Mark Hughes was sacked at the Etihad.

Pellegrini’s future could hinge on how his team perform against Barcelona in the Champions League, but the Chilean remained a picture of calm at his pre-match press conference on Tuesday.

He said: ‘I don’t feel any pressure from inside the club or from outside.

‘I never feel pressure. It has been the same the last two years, the only pressure is my own pressure – the pressure I make on myself when I don’t think the team is playing well.

‘We are in a normal position, we’re involved in the Champions League, if we win on Wednesday I think we are just one point less than last season. 

We have a lot more important things to think about than pressure.’

Pellegrini confirmed that Yaya Toure and new £28million signing Wilfried Bony will arrive back in England later in the week after helping Ivory Coast lift the Africa Cup of Nations in Equatorial Guinea, although City are not involved in the FA Cup this weekend.

The champions have failed to win any of the six league games Toure has missed this season – they did beat Bayern Munich and Roma in Europe – but Pellegrini was reluctant to dwell on players who will not be available to him for a difficult test at the Britannia Stadium.

‘It is very important to have Yaya back and playing with the team but we don’t just depend on one player,’ he added. ‘It is a very important player but we must win without him.

‘Bony will be a very important player for the squad also but we are not just depending on what Bony can do. We have also Edin Dzeko, we have Jovetic, we have Kun Aguero, we have Silva. We have a lot of players that always score.

‘The players have different moments during the season. If you remember, at the beginning of the season, everyone asked why Yaya continued playing. After that it was a team that was only (relying) on Sergio Aguero and without Sergio Aguero it was impossible to play. When Sergio wasn’t fit, we continue winning all the games. Now he is coming back and all of us are expecting that he will recover his normal performance.

‘Stoke are always a very difficult team, especially playing at the Britannia. It is a difficult team for us because last season we just won here 1-0 and we drew there 0-0 so in every moment it is difficult.’

Sergio Aguero should recover his 'normal performance' soon after injury, according to Pellegrini
