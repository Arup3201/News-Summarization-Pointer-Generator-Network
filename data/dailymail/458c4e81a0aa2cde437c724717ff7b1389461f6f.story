Manchester City remain hopeful of signing central defender Eliaquim Mangala from Porto. 

The 23-year-old remains a priority for director of football Txiki Begiristain and manager Manuel Pellegrini and Sportsmail understands that City’s pursuit for the Frenchman will be accelerated following the player’s involvement at the World Cup in Brazil.  

City are understood to have been monitoring the player’s performances for almost eighteen months and he is considered to be the perfect partner for Vincent Kompany at the heart of the Manchester City defence.

City made a concerted effort to sign Mangala from the Portuguese side in January but they were unable to come to an agreement with Porto after they were quoted £50million for the double signing of midfielder Fernando and the defender. 

The club resolved to return for the pair this summer and they have since sealed the £12m purchase of Fernando and are now aiming to sign up his former team-mate.

The deal could be worth in excess of £30m but City will face competition from Barcelona and PSG.

Speculation suggesting that City have agreed a deal with Roma for Moroccan defender Mehdi Benatia is jumping the gun but the 27-year-old remains high on City’s agenda, with City officials hopeful of concluding a deal for Benatia or Mangala before the start of the season. 

Benatia, for his part, has decided that he wishes to leave the Italian club this summer and is eager to move to the Etihad Stadium but Roma are determined to secure a replacement before allowing him to leave.
