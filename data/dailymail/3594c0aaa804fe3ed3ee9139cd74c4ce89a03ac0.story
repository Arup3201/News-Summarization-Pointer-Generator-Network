A furious David Moyes stormed onto the pitch to confront the referee after the full-time whistle after a last-gasp penalty from Levante denied him a first away win in charge of Real Sociedad.

The former Manchester United boss was far from happy at Santiago Jaime Latre's decision to award a spot-kick to the hosts' deep into stoppage time, after Carlos Martinez was penalised for handball.

As a result Sociedad are now without a win in three league games and sit just three points above the relegation zone in La Liga.

Sergio Canales fired the visitors into the lead three minutes after the interval as they looked on course for back-to-back league wins.

The hosts - after having the better of the first half - should have gone into the break with the lead but squandered various opportunities, most notably from David Barral inside just eight minutes.

They were left to rue their missed opportunities as Canales struck with a clinical finish shortly after the break, before Andreas Ivanschitz struck at the death from the penalty spot. 

Both sides remain firmly poised in the lower regions of the table, with 15 points from their opening 16 games played.
