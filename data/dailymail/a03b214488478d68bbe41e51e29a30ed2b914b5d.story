Airports are often named in honour of famous people to recognise their achievements but a survey has found that a majority of children not only don’t know who the celebrated are but they also think that a number of them had totally different careers.

One in ten of the children questioned thought that former US President Ronald Reagan was really Ronald McDonald and footballing legend George Best was the king of Great Britain.

British Airways quizzed 2,000 adults and children on their airport awareness and found that the youngsters recognised only 40 per cent of the famous names and although the adults had a 70 per cent success rate, they struggled with some of the most popular destinations.

Belfast City Airport which is now George Best Airport. Despite what some children apparently think footballing legend Besty was not the king of Great Britain

King George, Besty was an internationally famous footballer not the king of Britain and they thought that President John F. Kennedy was a celebrated sailor. He was. Haven't they heard of PT109?

Lagging in a number of categories, 11 per cent of London children believe JFK was a famous sailor.

Just 16 per cent recognised Pat McCarran from Las Vegas, and only 15 per cent knew that Sydney airport was named after Australian Aviator Charles Knutsford-Smith.

Additionally, 10 per cent of adults think Venetian explorer Marco Polo was a fashion designer, 3 per cent think Leonardo da Vinci was the star of Titanic, and 2 per cent believe Mother Teresa founded website Mumsnet.

The children surveyed had some odd ideas about what the famous actually did. Although they naturally recognised Harry Styles (72 per cent), a tenth of them thought that Leonardo da Vinci was the star of the hit film Titanic, Christopher Columbus was a famous astrologer and as well as founding Mumsnet Mother Teresa was apparently the real name of Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother.

The same person? Some respondents believed that not only did Mother Teresa (left) found Mumsnet but hers was the real name of Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother (right)

There were regional discrepancies with teens from Northern Ireland, the South West and Yorkshire boasting the most impressive overall knowledge while those from the West Midlands had the lowest overall awareness.

All the respondents from Northern Ireland could identify Mother Teresa compared to just 48 per cent from the Midlands.

Youngsters in the West Midlands struggled the most with more than a quarter (27 per cent) incorrectly labelling Charles de Gaulle the founder of the Channel Tunnel, a third believing former Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi is a Disney character, and a quarter (26 per cent) thinking Barbados President Grantley Adams is Rihanna’s real name.

Claire Bentley, British Airways Holidays’ managing director, said: ‘We were surprised that some of our most popular destinations, such as McCarran International Las Vegas, Chicago O’Hare and Barbados Grantley Adams airports, had some of the lowest recognition of origin of their names. We hope this piece of research will raise awareness for some of the greats that airports have been named after.’
