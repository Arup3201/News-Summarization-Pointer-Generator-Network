More than half of police and crime commissioners have had misconduct complaints made against them.

The police watchdog has received allegations of wrongdoing against 23 of the 41 officials who were elected in November 2012.

The commissioners replaced police authorities in England and Wales in a bid to make policing more accountable, but as concerns grow over their conduct a parliamentary committee is due to investigate the high level of complaints.

Keith Vaz MP, chairman of the Commons Home Affairs committee, pictured, said he was concerned over the level of complaints made against crime commissioners and he would raise the matter immediately

The Independent Police Complaints Commission last night said only six of the 43 complaints had resulted in full investigations.

Yet Keith Vaz, the chairman of the home affairs committee, told the Times newspaper the number of complaints was disappointing, adding: ‘What it shows is that people appear to have lost confidence with the office to such an extent that there is the equivalent of one complaint per police authority.’

The Labour MP said he would write to police and crime panels to see what had been done about the complaints the IPCC had been unable to investigate.

Among the cases referred to the IPCC is the recent resignation of South Yorkshire’s commissioner Shaun Wright. It is due to announce soon whether it will formally investigate allegations about his knowledge of child sexual exploitation while he worked at Rotherham council.

Lancashire’s Clive Grunshaw was investigated by the watchdog over expenses claims he made as a county councillor. The IPCC said the Crown Prosecution Service is again considering material after initially ruling he would not face any further action. Kent’s Ann Barnes is being investigated for an allegation of driving without insurance.

And the IPCC is due to announce whether it will hand prosecutors the case of Durham’s Ron Hogg over allegations about benefits he received while serving with Cleveland police. Allegations of electoral fraud by PCCs in Hampshire and North Wales were investigated but no action was taken.

An IPCC spokesman said 14 of the complaints were not investigated because they were allegations that the watchdogs had not registered with the Information Commissioner as information providers. Unless they are convicted of a crime, PCCs can only be ousted in elections held every four years.

Following Mr Wright’s initial refusal to resign over the Rotherham scandal Home Secretary Theresa May indicated she would back a new law to allow PCCs to be sacked in extreme circumstances.

The Association of Police and Crime Commissioners is also said to be considering the proposals, as well as ‘beefing up’ police and crime panels.
