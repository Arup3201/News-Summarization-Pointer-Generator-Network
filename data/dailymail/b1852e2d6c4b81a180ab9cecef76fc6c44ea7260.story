Meet the 'insanely cute' ball of fluff named Blossom that can fit in the palm of your hand. 

This baby yellow-bellied glider is the newest addition to Sydney's Taronga Zoo and ever since she was born in July her keepers have been smitten with her.

'She's very soft and altogether gorgeous at the moment,' zoo keeper Wendy Gleen told Daily Mail Australia.

Blossom is the 14th yellow-bellied glider to be born at Taronga, which maintains the world's only successful breeding program for the species

'She's absolutely beautiful and she's quite vocal... which is really sweet.'

Blossom is the 14th yellow-bellied glider to be born at Taronga, which maintains the world's only successful breeding program for the species. 

'We're tracking her developing since birth, which is the first time we've done that,' Wendy said. 

'We've been keeping an eye on her milestones - what age they leave the pouch and what age they are when they open their eyes.'

'When they first emerge from the nest, it’s a bit of a milestone... Blossom is pretty much at that stage now.'

Blossom is the first joey that keepers have been monitoring since birth, which has allowed them to learn about a glider's development for the first time

There's even a camera set up near Blossom to see when she first leaves her nest box as her parents go out and forage like they would in the wild

Yellow-bellied gliders are under threat due to local bushland being broken up by development along the eastern seaboard where they're found. 

Wendy said people can help preserve the population by planting trees and shrubs that are found locally in backyards to create wildlife corridors and by getting involved with local bush regeneration groups.

'If every Australian could meet a yellow-bellied glider, it would be a better world,' Wendy said. 

'They capture your heart so when we can introduce them to people... we can use that emotional connection to talk about how we can help the wild population.' 

Taronga Zoo's Education team also launched Project Yellow-bellied Glider with school students on the NSW Central Coast this year as part of its successful community wildlife education program. 

The project teaches students how to help their community take action to protect Yellow-bellied Gliders and their native habitat.
