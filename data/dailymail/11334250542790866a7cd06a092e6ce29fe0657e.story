These stunning images show an enormous swarm of long-tailed mayflies magically rising out of the water to mate.

The spectacular show on the Tisza river, near Tiszainoka in Hungary, only lasts for a few hours because the mayflies - also known as Tisza flies because of their prevalence in the river - live for just one day.

The Tisza fly 'blooming season' occurs from late spring to early summer each year and the whole river becomes infested with millions of mayflies taking to the air to frantically find a mate before they die.

Fascinating yet frightening: Tourists ride a boat to watch long-tailed mayflies on the Tisza river in Tiszainoka, Hungary

The bizarre natural phenomenon has 
become quite a tourist attraction, with many people planning trips to 
watch the huge insects, which can measure as long as five inches from 
tip to tail.

The larvae of long-tailed mayfly, 
known officially as Palingenia longicauda, develop in the mud for up to 
three years before hatching.

They live in in tunnels deep beneath the river bed, sometimes at a density of 400 tunnels per square metre.

After reaching the adult stage, adults
 only have about three hours to mate before they die, which causes 
groups of males will to desperately fly about to try find a suitable 
female.

Once they have found a mate, the long-tailed mayflies copulate on the surface of the 135km-long river south-east of Budapest.

After hatching the adults only have a few hours to mate before they die. Once they have found a mate, the long-tailed mayflies mate on the surface of the 135km-long river southeast of Budapest.

But there is no romance in the mayfly 
courtship repertoire. Copulation is often a forced act with as many as 
20 males pursuing a lone, harried female.

Unlike other mayfly species, the adults never lose contact with the water surface, trailing their tails along it as they swarm.

The slow flow of the Tisza and absence of surface-feeding fish in its waters help make this possible

Females will fly between one and three
 km before laying their eggs on the river, which then sink to the bottom
 and hatch after about 45 days.

When larvae finally break for the 
surface of the river three years later females moult once and males shed
 twice before reaching full sexual maturity.

Living fossils: Mayflies are part of an ancient group of insects termed the Palaeoptera, which also contains dragonflies and damselflies

Sometimes the mayflies become confused, however, and mistake wet road surfaces for the river

Mayfly larvae and the adults emerging from the water are a vital source of food for many other freshwater creatures, especially fish such as trout and salmon

The name ¿mayfly¿ is misleading because this group of insects can appear throughout the year. Tisza flies ten to emerge in June

Mayflies are part of an ancient group of insects termed the Palaeoptera, which also contains dragonflies and damselflies.

Aristotle's observation of the creatures' brief lifespans inspired him to dub them, poetically, the 'ephemeron'.

Both the larvae and the adults play a 
vital role in river ecosystems because they are a vital source of food 
for many other freshwater creatures, especially fish such as trout and 
salmon.

Now extinct in many European countries, the presence of P. longicauda is an indicator of clean unpolluted water.

As well as in Hungary, they can still 
also be found in the Tisza river where it flows through Serbia, along 
the Prut river in Romania and in the lower Danube basin.

Long-tailed mayflies are also known as Tisza flies because they are so prevalent on the Tisza river in Hungary

They frantically take to the air to find a mate before they reproduce on the surface of the water and die hours later

The annual Tisza fly 'bloom' occurs every year and has become a popular tourist attraction

In antiquity observations of the creatures' short life-span earned them the name 'ephemeron'
