Two firefighters with the Austin Fire Department were pictured saving a dog from flood waters in central Texas yesterday.

The department posted the picture of firefighters Matt Harvey and Michael Cooper with the animal to their Facebook page, saying:  'We don't just rescue two-legged victims...we love our four legged friends as well.

The animal looks like it's been through a lot, and clings to one of the firefighters as if they're hugging.

Overnight rains of up to 15 inches in some areas swelled rivers and washed out low-lying crossings in a swath of more than 100 miles around Austin, Texas, according to Jon Zeitler, meteorologist with the National Weather Service Austin-San Antonio office.

'For certain areas, it looks like this will be in their Top 10 (flood events) of all time,' Zeitler said.

A man died on Thursday in a flooded area southeast of Austin after being caught in high water in his car, officials said. Local media later in the day reported a second body in a creek closer to the city but further information was unavailable.

More than 1,000 homes in neighborhoods near rising creeks were evacuated during the height of the floods.

'We saw very significant flooding,' City Manager Marc Ott said at news conference yesterday. 'In some cases people cut holes through rooftops to have access to the outside.'

The storm was caused in part by Hurricane Raymond, which dissipated in the Pacific Ocean on Tuesday. Its remnants pulled heavy weather across the western United States.

That combined with warm, humid, low-lying air from the Gulf of Mexico and cooler air at higher altitudes to produce the floods - conditions expected to return next week with more potential for flooding from a tropical storm brewing in the same region, Zeitler said.

The storm system had shifted out of Austin and to the east by Thursday morning. As of Friday, the city was beginning to access the damage.
