Students at a top primary school have had their SATs results ripped up following allegations of cheating.

Dorrington Academy in Birmingham had been on course to become one of the country's highest performing primaries.

But the school has been dropped from this week's national league table after at least one Year 6 student was accused of cheating in the nationwide exams.

All of the pupils will now see their results annulled following a ruling by the Department for Education.

Today, headteacher Loretta Barratt - who has been in charge of the school in Perry Bar for six years - said she was 'devastated' by the decision.

'It should have been the best year we ever had. But someone, for their own reasons, has not allowed that to happen,' she said.

'We had the most phenomenal cohort of pupils. We were meant to be celebrating becoming an outstanding school.

Maladministration: Headteacher Loretta Barratt has refused to give any details about the alleged cheating

'I am devastated, the staff are devastated. It has been a very difficult time.'

The 700-pupil school - which teaches children aged between three and 11 - is one of just 25 across the UK to have fallen foul of exam watchdogs at the Standards Testing Agency (STA) this year.

Stunned parents were informed of the ruling - which has affected dozens of 11-year-old children - two weeks ago.

However, both the school and the STA have refused to give any further details about the alleged cheating.

Miss Barratt, 49, said: 'I have been instructed by the legal department that I cannot say any more.

'At the end of the day, we have dealt with it. We have appointed an external invigilator to oversee exam procedure.

'As a manager of this school, I am going to make sure the integrity of future procedures takes place.

'I am hell-bent on ensuring that happens. To that end, everything will be moderated externally.'

Chairman of governors Lorraine Gumbs, added: 'Of course it's a shock - you don't expect your results to be annulled.

'Parents have been fine and been kept informed. I've had no comeback.'

However, some parents claim they are yet to be informed of the allegations.

Dawn Daisley, 41, whose daughter Jessica attends the school, said: 'I've not heard a thing about this. Nothing been said to us, I'm a little disappointed.

'But if they have put new measures in place then it shouldn't happen anymore.'

Parent Ake Obi, 38, added: 'I'm unhappy to hear this. I'm not comfortable with this information.'

It is the second bombshell parents have had to face this year after deputy headteacher Tim Caddick resigned for 'personal reasons' in July.

And earlier this year, Miss Barratt described the school as having previously been in an 'appalling' state.

In a statement to an employment tribunal hearing into a former employee's grievance, she said: 'The school had been 10 years behind in progress and teaching methods and standards had been appalling.

'Half the staff had left and a high percentage of parents had withdrawn their children.'

A spokesman for the Department for Education refused to reveal the nature of the cheating allegations, but said: 'The number of schools where results have been amended or annulled due to maladministration this year is consistent with previous years.

'It illustrates that the majority of schools administer the tests rigorously.

'Instances of maladministration that lead to the annulment or amendment of children's test results are rare, but completely unacceptable.'
