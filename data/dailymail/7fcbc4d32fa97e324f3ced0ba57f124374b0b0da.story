The Seattle Seahawks have apologized for a tweet that linked their improbable NFC championship game victory to Martin Luther King Jr.

On Monday, the national holiday celebrating the slain civil rights leader, the team sent out a Twitter message that said, 'We shall overcome.'

The tweet featured a picture of an emotional Russell Wilson, the team's quarterback, next to a quote from King and the hashtag MLKDay.

The quote said 'Faith. You don't have to see the whole staircase, just take the first step.'

Message: The Seattle Seahawks apologized for a tweet that linked their improbable NFC championship game victory to slain civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr.

Mashable pointed out that Wilson's own great-great-grandfather was a slave during the Civil War and was later freed when it ended.

Later, the team deleted the tweet and sent out an apology for 'poor judgement.'

The tweet read, 'We apologize for poor judgment shown in a tweet sent earlier. We did not intend to compare football to the civil rights legacy of Dr. King.

On Sunday, the Seahawks came from behind to defeat the Green Bay Packagers 28-22.

They will face the New England Patriots in the Super Bowl on February 1.

Multiple Twitter users commented on the team's tweet.

One user wrote 'MLK's "We shall overcome" is about civil rights and achieving equality, it is blasphemous to compare it to a football game. @Seahawks'

Making amends: Later, the team deleted the tweet and sent out an apology for 'poor judgement' 

Victory: On Sunday, the Seahawks came from behind to defeat the Green Bay Packagers 28-22.They will face the New England Patriots in the Super Bowl on February 1

'Lol, the @Seahawks actually just tried to relate the struggles of MLK to those of a football team,' another said. 'Tweet deleted. Someone's getting fired.'

'.@Seahawks wow all this time i had no idea MLK was talking about football this really puts things in perspective thank you,' one tweet read.

Not all the messages poked fun at the Seahawks or were critical of their tweet.

'@Seahawks I didn't think it was offensive at all. Great reminder when faced with any kind of adversity. People just need to chill,' a user wrote.

Another posted 'Not to trivialize MLK but yesterday I lived a dream @seahawks no better way to honor the dream than seize the imagination of an entire city.'
