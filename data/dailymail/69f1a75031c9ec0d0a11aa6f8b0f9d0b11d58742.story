The trial of a pizza delivery boy who has been charged with strangling his roommate before stabbing her and then having sex with her corpse has been delayed.

Bryan Santana of Orlando, Florida, who is accused of killing Shelby Fazio and her dog last October, has been ordered to undergo a mental evaluation by the judge in the case.

This after Santana's lawyer argued that he is not competent to stand trial following an incident earlier in the day where he smeared feces all over himself and tried to hit a corrections officer at the courthouse.

'He has now soiled himself and smeared himself in feces and smeared the wall, said Judge Renee Roache after the incident, according to WKMG. 

'I've ordered security to clean him up and bring him up here in full restraints.'

And while she is allowing two doctors to examine the young man, she has made it clear that she has no time for this behavior.

'He certainly knows how to behave himself in the courtroom. He behaved himself very well yesterday. Now that the train is coming down the tracks at full speed, we are seeing some other behavior,' she said.

'I will not tolerate disruption in this courtroom. If I have to gag him, I will. If I have to remove him I will.' 

Testimony has now been pushed back to begin on Wednesday morning as Santana, 21, faces murder charges for allegedly strangling Fazio with a belt before stabbing her in the neck with a pen and the having sex with her corpse.

In earlier court documents, Santana confessed to the strangling, stabbing and sexual intercourse.

He also allegedly killed Fazio's dog and wrote out 'I'm sorry I did this' in animal blood on a wall.

This after Fazio, 23, had moved in with the young man to begin a job at Disney World.

The two had a third roommate who Santana also allegedly tried to kill, and for which he faces an attempted murder charge. 

That roommate claims Santana pepper sprayed them and came at them with a knife.

After the incident, Santana is believed to have taken Fazio's car and tried to go to a Walmart to buy a toy gun in hopes that he would be shot dead pointing it at police. 

He also went and got a haircut. 

Friends say the young man no longer wanted to live.
