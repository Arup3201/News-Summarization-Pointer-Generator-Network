A registered nurse aboard a flight on which a 16-year-old boy died Saturday has spoken about his desperate attempts to help save the boy.

Dan Goslin was sitting about 15 rows behind the teenager when crew began calling for anyone with medical training to come and help the teenager, who had cerebral palsy and may have suffered from birth defects.

Goslin told WSBTV that he and two other passengers, a doctor and a midwife, did everything they could to revive the boy.

'He was having trouble breathing. We 
tried oxygen. That didn't work. We tried to move him out of the chair 
and get him to another position. That didn't work and everything we 
tried just really didn't work,' Goslin said.

The teen boy, who suffered from 
cerebral palsy, went into cardiac after a medical emergency 30 minutes 
after take-off from Seattle, Spokane Fire Department spokesperson Brian 
Schaeffer told MailOnline.

The
 boy was flying with his mother, grandmother and another sibling to 
visit his father, who is stationed at McChord Air Force Base, for Christmas, according to Mr Schaeffer.

‘The majority of the family went on the plane to fly down to Georgia this afternoon,’ he added.

There
 is no indication as to why the unidentified boy had the medical 
emergency, but passenger Joe Ryan, of Atlanta, told MailOnline the 
flight crew notified people on-board the boy had cerebral palsy.

Washington
 State patient-confidentiality rules prohibit local officials from 
divulging such information outside of a coroner’s report, said Mr 
Schaeffer, but he did say there was nothing in his medical history to 
suggest such an incident was to be expected.

'It was an unexpected event by any means,' he said.

The boy and his family were sitting at the back of the plane when they began calling for help, said Mr Ryan.

The flight crew immediately sprung 
into action. Despite the dire circumstances, everyone – including 
passengers – remained calm and collected throughout.

‘It
 was calm and the male flight attendants rushed to his aid at the back 
of the plane,’ said Mr Ryan. ‘They started performing CPR on him… the 
pilot got on the air and said we are going to have an emergency 
landing.’

‘We were on the ground in five minutes... I think that they did everything they could to save that boy’s life,' Mr Ryan added.

Emergency personnel were already on their way when the plane touched down.

‘We
 met them on the ground with our fire fighter paramedics and attempted 
resuscitate him for well over 30 minutes,’ Mr Schaeffer said.

‘Paramedics
 rushed on to the plane, you could tell there was a lot of urgency… then
 everything calmed down and you could put two and two together,’ Mr Ryan
 lamented.

The boy was pronounced dead on the plane.

His body was removed by ladder from the back of the plane, according to Mr Ryan.

The deceased boy’s devastated family was put up in a local hotel which is being paid for by charities linked to the Spokane Fire and Police Departments, as well as Spokane International Airport.

The father is expected to arrive in Spokane early Saturday evening.

‘We’re doing everything we can for them,’ Mr Schaeffer said.

A preliminary cause of death has not yet been determined, but an autopsy is expected to take place within 24 hours.

A Delta spokesperson told MailOnline the flight, which originally had about 250 passengers is expected resume later Saturday and land in Atlanta about seven hours later than its originally scheduled time.
