Speaking at Variety magazine's unite4humanity event, Miss Poehler said: 'Today I lost a dear, young friend in my life who was struggling with addiction, so, I don’t really feel like telling any jokes. 

'I’m kind of sad, and it’s really great to be here tonight and listen to all of you, and listen to the great work that you do and be reminded why we live in this bizarre planet called "Hollywood."'

The death is being investigated as a possible drug overdose, and the Los Angeles County coroner's office will determine the exact cause.

In the past the comic writer has spoken of his battle with addiction and has checked himself into rehab twice.

The night before he was found dead, Wittels performed a stand-up set at The Meltdown comedy theater in Los Angeles.

On stage, Wittels joked about being clean and sober and said that at this point in his life he was in a good place. 

Billy Eichner, who plays highly-strung character Craig Middlebrooks on the show, said: 'Don't know what to say. Harris Wittels was a fantastic writer I had the pleasure to work with at Parks and Rec. So so sad. RIP Harris.'

In an outpouring of emotion, comedian Sarah Silverman praised and chastised Wittels, calling him 'brilliant beyond compare', but adding that she was 'so mad at you Harris.'

Ms Silverman posted on Twitter: 'He was my baby. I just keep thinking of Superman flying backwards around the world. I wish I could do that. I'm so mad at you Harris.

Comedian Sarah Silverman also worked closely with Harris on her own self-titled show where he was a writer

Late Night host Seth Meyers also weighed in on the tragic loss

Parks and Rec star Aubrey Plaza also expressed her sadness at the loss

'You should know that Harris was brilliant beyond compare. That his imagination was without limit. That he loved comedy more than anything.

'That his heart was big and he FELT hard. That he was someone who would reach out and tell you he was thinking of you for no particular reason.

'That he was honest if it was going to piss you off or make him look s*****. He told the truth. Even when it was ugly. Even when he lied.' 

Wittels had worked closely with Miss Silverman on her own self-titled show, which ran from 2007 to 2010, as a writer. 

Parks and Recreation, which won a Golden Globe for Miss Poehler and was nominated for a host of other accolades, is wrapping up its six-year run next Tuesday.

In the tradition of great movie directors such as Alfred Hitchcock and Quentin Tarantino, Wittles also made eight appearances in his show as a dim-witted pest controller.  

He initially started as co-producer on the NBC show, before rising to co-executive producer.

The talented comic was spotted by Sarah Silverman who saw him perform stand-up in 2006 and gave him a writing job on her Comedy Central series.

He is also credited as the man behind the term 'humblebrag,' and even published a book called 'Humblebrag: The Art of False Modesty,' in 2012.

'It was bragging, but it wasn't just bragging,' he wrote. 'It was a type of bragging that included some amount of fake modesty, which somehow made it acceptable to do.' 

Wittels had been in rehab twice and had opened up about his struggle with addiction on the podcast WTF with Marc Maron

Wittels, pictured here with actor Paul Reiser, had worked on several comedy shows and was also credited as the inventor of the term 'humblebrag'

The book was partially based on his social media presence, as he ran a massively popular Twitter account with more than 85,000 followers.

He was also a regular guest on the podcast Comedy Bang Bang where hosted a segment called Harris' Phone Corner and read jokes he'd texted himself.

'Just call half-and-half' one,' The Verge recalled one of the 'mostly terrible' gags.

Variety notes that Wittels had openly discussed his past struggles with narcotics, notably on the Marc Maron podcast WTF. 

Wittels was also set to perform with a musical trio called Don't Stop or We'll Die on February 28 at the UCB Theater.

Wittels played drums in the band alongside fellow comics Michael Cassady and Paul Rust.  

Originally from Houston, Texas, Wittels started doing stand-up in junior high, moving to Los Angeles immediately after graduating from Emerson College in 2006 to start his comedy career.

After sending a video of himself performing to the Upright Citizens Brigade, he earned a place on its most popular show, 'Comedy Death-Ray.'

He was also a fixture at the popular comedy club Largo.  

Pictured here with Alan Yang, Wittels ran a popular Twitter account and mined it for a 2012 book called 'Humblebrag: The Art of False Modesty' in 2012
