John Capra has received a $700 bill for ambulance transportation services from Delray Beach, Florida, which came as a shock to him because at the time of the medical emergency he was nearly 1,250 miles away.

According to police, the hefty fee stemmed from a November 6 incident in which a man, who gave his name to paramedics as John Capra, possibly overdosed on heroin in the 2200 block of Bloods Grove Circle at around 3am and had to be taken to a hospital.

The patient also gave John Capra's date of birth and address in New Jersey.

Emergency: Runnells had to be taken to the hospital after possibly overdosing on heroin in Delray Beach, Florida. The $700 bill for the service was later sent to John Capra 

The only problem was, the real John Capra was at home in Morristown at the time, completely unaware of the drama playing out in Delray Beach located just over 1,240 miles away.

It was not until Tuesday, when the real John Capra got the bill from the Delray Beach Fire Department at his home in New Jersey, that he realized his identity had been stolen, reported the Sun-Sentinel. 

In addition to the ambulance bill, police also filed drug possession charges against John Capra.

Police later determined that the real name of the culprit was 23-year-old John Rannells.

Speaking to the Sentinel Thursday, John Capra described Rannells as someone he used to 'associate with' in the past.

And according to the Morristown man, it was not the first time that his former friend has misused his identity.

Back in August, Rannells gave his name as John Capra to the Branchburg Police Department in New Jersey during an arrest.

Fortunately for the real Mr Capra, the Delray Beach Fire Department has proven very helpful in clearing his name, and he also will not be forced to pay the ambulance bill.

But as of Friday afternoon, the name John M. Capra still appeared on the site Mugshots.com next to John Rannells’ booking photo in connection to the November 6 arrest.

According to the rules of the site, a person wishing to have his or her arrest record removed from the database will have to fill an unpublishing application and pay a minimum of $399.

Laundry list of charges: The 23-year-old, who also has an arrest record in New Jersey, has been hit with a slew of drug and identity theft counts in Florida 

Meanwhile, Rannells has been charged with drug possession; giving false identification to a law enforcement officer; using false identification that adversely affects another and using a person's identification without consent.

He is being held in the Palm Beach County jail on $8,000 bail.

According to online records, the 23-year-old was arrested in Essex County, New Jersey, in February on a slew of drug charges, including manufacturing and selling controlled dangerous substances near a school.
