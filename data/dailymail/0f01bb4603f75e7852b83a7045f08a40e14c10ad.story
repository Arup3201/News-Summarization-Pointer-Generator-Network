Paris Hilton has hit back at claims by a former Baywatch star that he was set upon at her Malibu, California, beach house.

Jeremy Jackson, 33, claims he was attacked and struck in the head with a bottle about 2am on Sunday by the heiress and her friends.

However, Paris has broken her silence saying it was the 33-year-old former child star who was the aggressor not herself or her friends.

'Not true': Paris Hilton has hit back at claims by a former Baywatch star that he was set upon at her Malibu, California, beach house

Tweeting late Sunday night, the Simple Life star said Jeremy - who played Hogie on the popular Nineties show - 'barged into my home uninvited & put 2 of my friends in the hospital when he was told to leave'.

The heiress then posted a link to a longer explanation of what she said occurred at the rented beach pad.

Paris wrote: 'We had no idea who he was, he was so creepy. My friends were telling him "We don't know you, please leave" several times & he refused. 

'He then attacked my friends & 
destroyed property at my house. All we wanted was for him to leave &
 he went ballistic. It was so scary.'

Not welcome: The star took to twitter to explain her side of the story saying Jeremy Jackson 'barged' into her home early Sunday

Forgetting the drama: On Sunday, Paris was seen stepping out in Los Angeles putting a brave face on the event

Not tarnished: The 33-year-old still enjoyed her holiday home on Sunday despite the alleged incident, posting this image in the evening saying, '#Malibu + #Summer = #BikiniTime'

A rep for Hilton issued the following statement to Mail Online: 'This past Saturday night Paris was at home with a small group of friends when Jeremy Jackson entered her house.

'Paris does not know Jackson and was concerned that he was an intruder. One of her friends asked him to leave at which he became frustrated and started acting aggressively as a guest tried to escort him from the premises.'

'When others stepped in to help, he reacted violently towards them,' the statement continued. 'Eventually Jackson left the premises and the police were called but all parties declined to press charges. Paris has experienced problems with stalkers and intruders on a number of occasions and it is frightening experience for her to have anyone she doesn’t know coming into her home.'

Different stories: Jeremy, shown in Los Angeles in September, claimed he was viciously attacked in a brawl that reportedly left Barron Hilton, shown in February in New York City, in hospital

Jeremy told a different story to TMZ
 whom published a photo of the star - who has become a personal trainer 
after beating a drug addiction - showing his left eye swollen and 
bloody.

The website 
reported: 'Jeremy Jackson says Paris, Brandon Davis and others viciously
 attacked him at around 2 AM ... someone cracking a liquor bottle on his
 head.' 

The former television star told TMZ: 'They were literally going Rodney King on my ass.'

A source from Paris' camp claimed it was Jeremy that violently exploded.

A representative for the 33-year-old said that five or six people were at the beach house when Jackson 
and a few of his friends walked in uninvited.

The
 website says oil heir Brandon Davis asked the unwelcome guests to leave
 but Jeremy allegedly refused saying 'Don't you know who I am? I was on 
Baywatch and Celebrity 
Rehab.'

Reportedly involved: Jasmine Waltz, shown in January in London, allegedly hit Jackson in the head with a vodka bottle after he wouldn't leave

The Baywatch star then allegedly grabbed a man and 
started choking him and several people rushed to subdue him, including 
recent UK Celebrity Big Brother contestant Jasmine who reportedly struck Jeremy over the head with a vodka bottle.

During
 the fight Paris' younger brother Barron Hilton was injured and remained
 in the hospital on Sunday after receiving stitches.

Paris' camp claims the reality star then left breaking something off Paris' car.

A police source confirmed law enforcement was called by two separate people to a disturbance but no one wanted to press charges when 
police arrived at the beach house Paris has been renting for $65,000 a 
month, so no arrest was made.
