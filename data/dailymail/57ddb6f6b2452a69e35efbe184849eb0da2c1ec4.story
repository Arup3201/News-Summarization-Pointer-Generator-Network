David Beckham may be able to carry off the tightest of briefs, but it appears the women of Britain don't want their partners to follow his sartorial example.

A new survey shows that a whopping 89 per cent of women favour pants with a bit more coverage, with only 11 per cent preferring their men in Beckham-style 'budgie-smugglers'.

Sadly, not all men look like David Beckham when wearing tiny briefs

Eighty-nine per cent of women preferred the boxers modelled by Dan Osborne from TOWIE (right) to briefs like those on model David Sanz (left)

Model David Sanz and TOWIE cast-member Dan Osborne showcased the different styles at a photoshoot for Clothes Show TV.

David stepped up to sport the briefs, while Dan represented ‘Team Boxers’.

The pair tried on three styles each from well-known High Street and designer names, including M&S, Calvin Klein, David Beckham for H&M, and the Clothes Show Live’s very own Henry Holland.

Women around the country were then asked to vote for their favourite look on Facebook, Twitter and the Clothes Show website, with boxers emerging as the clear winner in each of the three rounds of the competition.

And it appears the models sided with the ladies. Dan Osborne said: ‘I like boxers although they probably look better on David Beckham than on me!’

But it's not time to dig out those saggy, dad-style numbers. We're in agreement with Paddy McGuinness -  who is launching Take Me Out Live at the Clothes Show Live this December - who says: ‘ I prefer boxers but not those big baggy things, more a good pair of Calvin Klein’s.’

So there you have it: invest in a nice pair of trunks if you want to please the woman in your life. Or, if you're David Beckham, stick to the tiniest pants possible.
