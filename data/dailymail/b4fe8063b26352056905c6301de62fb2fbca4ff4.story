If you have ever started a moan to friends with the words 'Waitrose ran out of...' then prepare to cringe.

As the middle-class has grown, so have their woes and the online world is choc-a-bloc with mothers and fathers blogging about crises that are anything but.

Now one comedian has created a Twitter account to poke fun at the  'problems' associated with middle class life.

The channel, which has over 3000 followers, pokes fun at the 'problems' of the middle classes

From high end food to the problems of having a maid, Middle Class Problem is a comic take on middle class life

From running out of alfafa, passata 
or 
Belazu white balsamic to skiing holiday injuries and tablet computer 
issues, twitter channel Middle Class Problems invites people to tweet 'real problems, that aren't really real problems, just middle class ones.'

A life of privilege obviously brings 
hardships for many : 'Starbucks all out of pumpkin spice..oh well I'll 
just have to settle for salted caramel mocha' complains one follower.

While another tweets: 'I've eaten too much of Heston's salted caramel popcorn from Waitrose and now I feel sick '

The perils and tribulations of having domestic staff, such as cleaners and gardeners is also a common topic.

Travel to exotic and luxury destinations clearly can cause many woes

Food snobbery and owning high end technology can cause travel to be a big problem

One particularly outrageous tweeter 
says: 'Dear cleaner: cleaning my house every week = helpful. bringing me
a cake you made from Nutella every week = not helpful.'

Followers also often share particularly outrageous 'middle class problems' they overheard.

One tweets: '"I can't cope with this place" ... "Darling don't get upset" Just overheard. IN PRET'

The creator of Middle Class Problems was also behind a parody twitter account of austere director Michael Haneke

The
channel also retweets any tweets that bemoan an insignificant problem, 
and actor Stephen Fry is amongst those who have been retweeted on the 
page.

It's all in good middle class humour though and creator of the Twitter handle Benjamen Lee,  28-year-old deputy editor of Shortlist.com,  is quick to mock his own middle class behaviour, including complaining about parma ham, plane food and holiday jabs.

It is not the London based journalists first foray into comic twitter accounts, as he was recently revealed as the person behind the spoof account of director Michael Haneke.

Tweeting on various unlikely topics, Mr Lee managed to convince a whole host of A-list celebrities including Debra Messing, Russell Crowe and Ben Affleck, that he was the esteemed, and notoriously serious, director of Amore, The White Ribbon and Hidden.

The parody channel managed to again 31,000 followers, including actresses such as Anna Kendrick, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Juno star Ellen Page, before Mr Lee’s identity was uncovered and he retired the account.

The channel both posts its own tweets and retweets those of others who make witty middle class comments

Issues surrounding high end food and drink feature prominently across the channel
