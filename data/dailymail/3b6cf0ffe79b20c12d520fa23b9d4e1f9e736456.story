A U.S. coffee company is claiming to produce the first and last cup of coffee ever needed to kick start your work day.

Death Wish, a medium-dark roast coffee blend roasted in Upstate New York, claims to be the 'most highly caffeinated premium dark roast organic coffee in the world.'

The brand, featuring a menacing black skull and cross bones, says they use coffee beans containing close to 200% of the amount of caffeine found in a typical coffee shop coffee.

In comparison, a tall, 12oz cup of 
regular Starbucks coffee contains an average of 260mg caffeine according
to Energy Fiend, making the potentency in each cup of Death Wish 
approximately 520mg.

The coffee that sells for $19.99 per 
1lb bag is organically grown, fair traded and shade grown to save more 
land, according to the company.

It's also said to have the full flavor of dark-roasted Arabica coffee beans without the loss of caffeine during its .

Explaining
this as a rarity, Death Wish states that dark roasts typically contain 
less caffeine than lighter roasts due to the amount of time the beans 
are cooked.

'The longer and darker you roast the coffee bean the more caffeine gets pulled/cooked out,' they state on their website.

'I was zipping around like I was the 
Flash,' a satisfied user wrote of the product while giving it five out 
of five stars on Amazon.com. 'Not only was it one of the strongest 
coffees I've ever had but it is also one of the best tasting and 
smelling.’

Promises: The coffee beans are said to have the full flavor of dark-roasted Arabica coffee beans without the loss of caffeine with the company offering a money-back guaranteed satisfaction with its purchase

'Ar first I 
was thinking that it whould be so strong that I whould not be able to 
drink .. but its very nuce and smooth and gives a big boost of energy 
!!' another Amazon user wrote.

'Much to my dismay, this is just regular coffee,' one of two negative reviews out of 15 shared in contrast. 'I'm chugging the stuff and still falling asleep sitting up.'

So secure with their product, the company offers a money-back guarantee with its sale according to its website.

'Buy a bag, if you hate it, send it back (within 60 days) and we will refund you your money plus shipping. No Risk. It’s the best part about selling a product we believe in,' they write.
