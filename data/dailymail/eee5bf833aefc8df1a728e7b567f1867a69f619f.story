If Louis van Gaal needs persuading to take Radamel Falcao on a permanent deal at the end of the season, then he'll still be in two minds after the match at Queens Park Rangers.

The Manchester United man has warned the Colombian he must prove he is worth a long-term contract with goals.

Falcao fluffed his lines big time at Loftus Road on Saturday, missing a series of chances to make his point to Van Gaal.

Falcao touched the ball four times in the QPR box

The first came in the 13th minute, taking down Juan Mata's superb lofted pass on his chest, Falcao had time to pick his spot - he shot straight at Rob Green, though.

Beyond that, his first-half involvement was minimal. While United were dominant in possession, the South American was being starved of decent service.

But if Falcao thought his first-half was one to forget, worse was to follow. 

Unmarked from six yards, the striker somehow failed to direct his angled header from Angel di Maria's cross past Green, who made an excellent stop in the 56th minute.

The Colombia international will have nightmares about kicking thin air with the goal gaping from six yards after Daley Blind's low cross in the 76th minute.

It was one for the end of season blooper show.

And that summed up his afternoon; a touch - any touch - would have put United 2-0 up. How he missed will remain a mystery.

So does his future at Old Trafford after Saturday 's misfiring performance.

Although his unimpressive afternoon didn't dampen the Colombian's spirits as he posted a picture on the train home with Manchester United team mate Victor Valdes.

He said: ‘with my friend @vicvaldes1We are returning home by train and happy for the victory.’
