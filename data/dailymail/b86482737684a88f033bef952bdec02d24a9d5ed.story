The costumes may have been bright, but the weather was anything but.

Rain and freezing temperatures tried to dampen the spirits of New Orleans' famous Mardi Gras celebrations, held earlier yesterday.

Revelers wore flamboyant colors and costumes despite the dreary weather -- while many others were photographed wearing raincoats, plastic hoods and carrying umbrellas.

The Zulu parade started on time, led by Mayor Mitch Landrieu and a horseback police vanguard, WDSU reports. Floats of the King of Carnival Rex later passed the crowds on St. Charles Avenue.

The temperature stayed in the high 30s in New Orleans, according to NBC News. The parade was also shortened for high school and college bands.

Despite the conditions, attendees told the Associated Press that they were not overly concerned.

'That's why God made washing machines,' Mark Nelson of St. Louis told the newsource as he sipped on a daiquiri.

Carol LeBlanc even mentioned an extra layer of protection.

'I've got my long johns on,' she said.

Celebrations were scheduled throughout south Louisiana and in coastal Mississippi and Alabama, sharing the traditions brought by French colonists in the 18th century.

In Louisiana's bayou parishes, riders on horseback would go from town to town, making merry in what is called the Courir du Mardi Gras.

The merriment must come to a halt at midnight, when the solemn season of Lent begins. New Orleans police were expected to sweep down Bourbon Street at midnight in the annual ritual of letting revelers know the party is over for another year.

At 4pm, the temperature hit 39 degrees -- one degree away from the coldest Mardi Gras ever, on February 14, 1989, according to the National Weather Service.

The highest Mardi Gras on record was on February 20, 1917 when temperatures hit 83 degrees.

Snow between 1 and 3 inches is also expected in western and central Kansas. The Dakotas and the Great Lakes will most likely be in the high 10s and 20s.

For the West, the channel says that rain between 1 - 3 inches may hit western Oregon, and 2 - 5 inches may hit western Washington, as two storms are riding a jet stream into the region.

Snowfall is also expected near the footills of the Cascade and Western Mountains. Another storm is possible for the weekend.
