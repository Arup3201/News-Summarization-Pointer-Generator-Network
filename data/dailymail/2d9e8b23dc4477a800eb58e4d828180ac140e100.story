Spanish golf star Sergio Garcia is facing losses running into millions after his biggest sponsor threatened to dump him last night in the wake of race comments he made about Tiger Woods.

Asked light-heartedly whether he would be inviting Woods round for dinner at the U.S. Open next month, Garcia said: ‘Every night — and serving him fried chicken.’

The Spaniard showed genuine remorse yesterday for an attempt at humour that went horriblywrong at a players’ awards dinner on Tuesday night.

But his abject apology for a remark that carries racist overtones — fried chicken is stereotypically
a food associated with African Americans — might not save his £5million-a-year deal with
TaylorMade.

Ashamed: Sergio Garcia apologised unreservedly for his comments over serving Tiger Woods 'fried chicken'

Embarrassed: Garcia admitted he has felt 'sick to his stomach' and could not sleep on Tuesday night

Reply: Tiger Woods took to Twitter to express his displeasure at Sergio Garcia's comments

Woods condemned the comment, but later sent a follow-up tweet to accept Garcia's apology and expressed his desire to move on.

A company statement said: ‘Sergio 
Garcia’s comment was offensive and in no way aligns with our values and 
corporate culture. We discussed with Sergio that his comments are 
clearly out of bounds and we are continuing to review the matter.’

The inference is clear. If it dominates the golfing news agenda in the US for any length of time, he will be history.

Woods wasted no time in tweeting his horror that his long-running feud with Garcia had stooped so low.

‘The comment that was made wasn’t 
silly. It was wrong, hurtful and clearly inappropriate,’ said the world 
No 1, who added: ‘I am confident there was real regret that the remark 
was made.’

Remarkably, given Garcia’s actions 
have overshadowed their flagship event — the BMW PGA Championship at 
Wentworth, which begins on Thursday — the European Tour said they 
considered the matter closed.

A crestfallen Garcia said: ‘To Tiger,
I say I am truly sorry and that I feel sick about it. My answer was 
stupid and out of place and I can’t say sorry enough about that.

'I 
wasn’t able to sleep at all last night. I wish I didn’t do it but the 
only thing I can do is apologise.’

Garcia, who admitted he had thought 
about pulling out of the event, is due on the first tee in the company 
of defending champion Luke Donald and his fellow Spaniard Gonzalo 
Fernandez-Castano.

He added: 'I was caught off guard by the question and understand the answer was totally stupid. I can't say sorry enough.

'I'd like to say sorry to the 
European tour and my Ryder Cup team-mates for taking the shine away from
a wonderful awards dinner.'

Asked if he will call Woods to 
reconcile with the world No 1, Garcia said: 'I don't have his number but
I called his manager and left a message.

'I'd love to talk as soon as possible and say how sorry I am. I want to apologise face to face and hopefully move on.

'It
was not meant as a racist comment. It seemed to be a funny question and
I tried to give a funny answer. It came out the wrong way.'

The two players have clashed on many occasions in the past. The long-running feud raised its head again at the Players Championship at Sawgrass a fortnight ago.

The root of their mutual antipathy 
goes all the way back to 1999.

The pair were duelling for the US PGA and
the teenage Garcia had the temerity to point across the course at 
Tiger, as if to challenge him.

Twelve months later, the Tiger tail was 
tweaked again when Garcia celebrated loudly after beating him in an 
exhibition match.

Since 
then, it has been all Woods, with the American winning 14 majors and Garcia none, but some of the old Garcia swagger certainly seems to have made a reappearance lately.
