When Walter Yeo was horrifically wounded during World War One, he became the first person in history to undergo modern plastic surgery.

These century-old photographs show before,
 during and after pictures of the groundbreaking medical procedure 
carried out on the disfigured sailor nearly 100 years ago,

Mr Yeo sustained terrible facial injuries including the loss of upper and lower eyelids while manning the guns aboard HMS Warspite in 1916.

Remarkable recovery:  Sailor Walter Yeo was horrifically wounded during World War One (left). He became the first person in history to undergo plastic surgery (right). Researchers are now trying to find our how successful the surgery was from any surviving relatives Mr Yeo may have

But in 1917 he was treated by Sir Harold Gillies - the first man to use skin grafts from undamaged areas on the body and known as ‘the father of plastic surgery’.

His remarkable transformation 
features an upcoming exhibition at the Royal Albert Memorial Museum 
which will explore the pioneering efforts to repair the lives of WW1 
veterans through plastic surgery.

Researchers
 working on the '1914FACES2014' project for this year’s World War One centenary have appealed for information from any of Mr Yeo’s surviving 
relatives.

They 
want to to find out how successful the pioneering op proved to be and 
trace others whose shattered features were rebuilt by Gillies and his 
colleagues.

Marjorie
 Gehrhardt, associate researcher with Exeter University’s college of 
humanities, said: 'I am trying to find out how the wounded sailors and 
soldiers - and also their families and the people they met every day out
 on the streets - coped with these very visible injuries.

“It would be wonderful to hear from people who knew the wounded combatants directly or indirectly.

'If
 they have memories or anecdotes they are happy to share, photographs of
 the men before or after their injuries, letters, family portraits or 
memoirs, everything can help us learn more about how veterans lived 
after the war, and how society at large coped with their return.'

London-based
 Sir Harold opened a specialist ward for the treatment of the 
facially-wounded at Queen Mary’s Hospital in Sidcup, Kent.

Mr Yeo suffered terrible facial injuries, including the loss of upper and lower eyelids . He later had a skin graft taken from his neck

Mr Yeo was born in 1890 and after marrying wife Ada, he was severely injured during the Battle of Jutland while manning guns.

Records show he was admitted to Sir 
Harold's care on August 8, 1917 - just two months after he opened 
his specialist hospital.

He
 is thought to be the first patient to benefit from his newly-developed 
technique, a form of skin grafting called ‘tubed pedical’.

The young sailor, of Plymouth, Devon, was given new eyelids with a ‘mask’ of skin grafted across his face and eyes.

He was treated by Sir Harold Gillies, who used tubular ‘pedicles’ from the forehead, scalp, chest, neck or shoulders but retained a connection to allow blood flow

Documents show that after the procedure, Mr Yeo, a gunnery warrant officer, was ‘improved, but still had severe disfigurement’.

Sir Harold is credited with developing new, untried techniques to treat the injuries created by this new kind of war, taking grafts from undamaged areas of flesh.

He used tubular ‘pedicles’ from the forehead, scalp, chest, neck or shoulders but retained a connection to allow blood flow.

He and his colleagues developed many techniques of plastic surgery and carried out more than 11,000 operations on over 5,000 men.
