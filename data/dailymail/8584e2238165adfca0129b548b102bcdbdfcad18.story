When Roald Dahl dreamed up Willy Wonka and his amazing, impossible sweets in the 1960s, he enthralled children of that generation, and in generations to come.

But while anybody who read Charlie and the Chocolate Factory - or saw the acclaimed 1971 film - will know the products came from a world of 'pure imagination', scientists have come close to making one Wonka-style treat a reality.

Researchers at the National University of Singapore have created a 'digital lollipop', which uses electric currents to transmit virtual tastes straight to your tastebuds.

Tasty? A young woman tries out the gadget, which transmits taste with electrical impulses

Magical: The creation is reminiscent of the wondrous sweets in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. The 1971 film adaptation is pictured

Pure imagination: The device has attributes of the fictional Everlasting Gobstopper and Chewing Gum Meal

The device has echoes of the fictional Everlasting Gobstopper, which never runs out, and the Chewing Gum Meal, which had several different flavours packed into one piece of gum.

All of the four major taste groups - sweet, salty, bitter and sour - can be mimicked through a silver electrode which makes contact with the tongue. The gadget also makes tiny adjustments in temperature to simulate tastes more convincingly.

Nimesha Ranasinghe, who led the research, told the New Scientist magazine: 'We have found noninvasive electrical and thermal stimulation of the tip of the tongue successfully generates the primary taste sensations'.

The invention is relatively crude at the moment, but there are hopes to make it small enough that users can almost wholly close their mouth while using it.

Sensational: Another tester uses the device, which can also mimic changes in temperature for a more authentic taste

There are also plans to make the simulation more precise by simulating the smell and texture of real food, which are important parts of how we taste.

Although at the moment the invention is little more than a novelty experience, Ms Ranasinghe says the lollipop could one day have medical uses.

She said: 'People with diabetes might be able to use the taste synthesiser to simulate sweet sensations without harming their actual blood sugar levels. Cancer patients could use it to improve or regenerate a diminished sense of taste during chemotherapy.'

The same team is also in the early stages of developing a way to transmit tastes from one device to another, in the hope that one day people will be able to 'taste message' as easily as email or text.
