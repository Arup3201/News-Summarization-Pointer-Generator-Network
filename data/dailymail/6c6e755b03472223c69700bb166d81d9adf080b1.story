A zookeeper was left fighting for his life yesterday after being attacked by a two-ton rhinoceros at one of Britain’s most popular attractions.

The man, in his 50s, was gored by the greater one-horned rhino at Whipsnade Zoo, when it suddenly turned on him as he worked in its enclosure. 

The victim, described as a senior staff member, was left with injuries to his chest, abdomen and pelvis.

It is thought the victim may have been trampled on and gored by the beast’s long bottom teeth, which are commonly used to attack rivals in the wild.

Colleagues rushed to his aid and found him ‘immersed in water’ – prompting speculation the animal may have thrown him into a wallowing pool during the attack.

Air ambulance paramedics treated him at the scene before taking him to hospital, where he underwent emergency surgery. 

The man, who has not yet been named, was last night said to be in a ‘stable’ condition.

It is believed he was feeding animals inside the Asian rhino enclosure at the zoo, in the Dunstable area of Bedfordshire, when the rhino - believed to be named Ajang - suddenly turned on him.

The incident happened just before 8.20am yesterday. The man was taken by ambulance to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge in a serious but stable condition.

Incident: Whipsnade Zoo in Dunstable, Bedfordshire, confirmed that the injured man was one of its keepers

Sally Anderson, 36, who was visiting the zoo yesterday with her two-year-old son Noah, said: ‘It is so shocking. You just never think things like that are going to happen.

‘We were in the rhino enclosure [yesterday] as they are Noah's favourite and they all looked perfectly friendly. It just reminds you what they are capable of - they are wild animals.’

Ajang, a Nepalese grey male rhino, was born in 2010 weighing 13st. The name means ‘enormous’ in Nepalese and the rhino shares the enclosure with three others, including his mother, Behan. 

The zoo was open as normal yesterday, although a zookeeper admitted it had been a ‘nightmare’ day because the rhino enclosure had been so full.

David Field, director at the Zoological Society of London (ZSL), which runs the zoo, told reporters that the keeper was now out of surgery and in a stable condition.

He said: ‘At approximately 8.15 [yesterday] morning one of our senior keepers was found injured within the Asian rhino enclosure. Procedures were immediately put into place to secure the scene and the emergency services were called.

‘The keeper was treated at the scene by paramedics and was then later taken to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge for further treatment. An investigation is under way to find out what happened but at this stage there are no further details.

‘I'm pleased to report that he is now out of surgery and doctors have described his condition as stable. ZSL staff and more importantly his family are with him at this time and he is being very well cared for.’

Dave Tamarro, of the East of England Ambulance Service, said: ‘When we arrived it was clear that the patient had received a number of injuries, including injuries to the chest, abdomen and pelvis.'

He added: ‘We stabilised the patient whilst the air ambulance was on its way. 

'Both trust staff and the Magpas air ambulance crew worked well together to treat the patient, who was then taken to Addenbrooke's Hospital by land ambulance in a serious condition.’ 

A Magpas air ambulance spokeswoman said the man had been given ‘enhanced pain relief’ at the scene. She said: ‘He was helped out of the water by staff at the zoo.

‘The Magpas team assessed the patient, who suffered serious injuries, and put measures into place to keep him warm as his body temperature had dropped considerably.’

A Bedfordshire Police spokesman said: ‘We were called to Whipsnade Zoo at around 8.25am. Our role was to assist the other emergency services.’

Whipsnade features a £1million Rhinos of Nepal exhibit with indoor heated pools so that the greater one-horned rhinoceros can wallow in muddy water all year round, according to the zoo's website.

Opened in 2008, it also has a specially-designed watch tower, modelled on those used by conservationists to spot rhino in the field.

A spokesman for Whipsnade confirmed that the incident took place in the Asian rhino enclosure, where five one-horned rhinos are kept.

Greater one-horned rhinos, also known as Indian rhinos, are described as ‘armour-plated’ giants and are the world's fifth largest land animal. They can be dangerous to humans when startled.

Males weigh around 4,600lb (2,100 kg) and females around 3,500lb (1,600 kg).

Listed as a vulnerable species, they are mainly found in India's north-eastern state of Assam and the Terai area of Nepal, where they live in the foothills of the Himalayas.

Attack: The rhino (file picture at Whipsnade Zoo) left the man with 'injuries to the chest, abdomen and pelvis'

There are 2,500 one-horned rhinos left in the wild - an increase from as few as 200 at the beginning of the 20th century.

They are good swimmers which spend up to 60 per cent of their day in water and were used by India's Moghul emperors in staged fights with elephants, which they would often win.

Poachers kill them for their horns to sell for use in traditional medicines and they are also threatened by grassland destruction, encroaching settlements and farmland in their habitat.
