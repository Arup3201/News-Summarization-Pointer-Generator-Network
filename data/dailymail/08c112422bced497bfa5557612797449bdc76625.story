Charlie Hebdo staff are embroiled in a bitter dispute over who gets to control the French magazine, months after eight of its writers and cartoonists were murdered by terrorists.

The row was sparked by a sudden increase in the magazine's sales and revenue in the wake of the brutal attacks on January 7, according to the Times.

It has reportedly made £21.6million since then after its usual circulation of 30,000-a-week rocketed to hundreds of thousands.

Now the surviving staff members want that money and shares of the magazine - 40 per cent of which are owned by its murdered editor's parents - to be divided equally.

As many as 11 employees have instructed their lawyers to turn the magazine - which has published cartoons of the prophet Muhammad on its cover - into a workers' cooperative.

It would mean they all have a stake in the company but their move has been attacked by another anonymous contributor in a leaked email to French news agency Agence France-Presse.

The unnamed contributor accused the plotters of trying to grab the shares that belonged to the magazine's murdered editor Stephane Charbonnier 'before the worms have finished eating him'.

40 per cent of the company is owned by his parents, another 40 by the magazine's new editor Laurent Sourisseau and the final 20 per cent belongs to financial director Eric Portheault.

One of the magazine's journalists Laurent Léger said: 'A new distribution of the capital would allow for the incredible influx of funds to the newspaper to be used in the most transparent manner possible.'

And Patrick Pelloux - who writes a column for Charlie Hebdo - believes a co-operative would bind contributors to the newspaper.

He said: 'When a company has been decimated, you feel completely tied to it. It is not a question of sharing the cake. The money does not interest us.'

However a spokesman for Sourisseau and Portheault said: 'All this money is doing more harm than good.

Demand: Since the brutal attack on Charlie Hebdo in January, the magazine's usual circulation of 30,000 a week has boomed to hundreds of thousands

'It makes you think of those funerals where everyone is fighting over the grandmother's jewellery on the way back from the cemetery.'

He added that the owners had promised not to pay themselves dividends for three years and wanted to ensure the £3million received in donations after the attack went to victims' families. 

'We note the desire of the staff to be associated with the life of the newspaper. But we are a long way from thinking about the make-up of the shareholders.'

This is not the first time that Charlie Hebdo has been split over financial matters. In 2008, it's then-editor Philippe Val faced a backlash when it emerged he paid himself dividends of over £200,000 when sale rose following the controversial publication of issues featuring the Propher Muhammad.
