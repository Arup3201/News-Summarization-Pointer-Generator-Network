The first game of 2015 and Louis van Gaal will hope there aren’t too many more like it over the course of the next 12 months. If the Dutchman didn’t fully appreciate what to expect from a trip to a blustery Britannia Stadium, he does now.

Manchester United came through a gruelling early New Year’s Day test in which they were bombarded, buffeted, at times besieged and yet ultimately still unbeaten in 10 games stretching back to the start of November.

Former Old Trafford favourite Mark Hughes has done a fine job polishing up the Potters since he took over here, but some of the old hallmarks still remain and Stoke relished making life as uncomfortable as possible for United in the windy conditions.

This was how Shawcross gave Stoke their second-minute lead... click here to find more heat maps, statistics and goals!

In the absence of key playmaker Bojan Krkic, Marko Arnautovic’s set-pieces were a constant menace, Peter Crouch a constant threat.

This was ‘old school’ Stoke according to Crouch who set up a goal for Ryan Shawcross inside two minutes, hit the post and had strong claims for a penalty turned down when Chris Smalling clearly handled his header in the second half.

Radamel Falcao equalised for United who should have been grateful to get out of the Potteries with a point.

Despite admitting that Stoke were the better team, however, Van Gaal was left frustrated with a third draw away from home over Christmas.

‘I’m not interested in a period of unbeaten, because I’m in a process,’ said the United manager. ‘We have to win away games and we didn’t do that.’

Van Gaal had complained about the demands of the festive fixture list in England, and his mood was not helped by the sight of Ashley Young limping out of his fourth game in 13 days with a pulled hamstring.

Young is expected to be out for up to a month while United’s other first-choice wing-back, Antonio Valencia, did not even make the trip on Thursday because of a thigh strain.

Van Gaal was even less happy with the way his team fell behind to a set-piece behind inside two minutes. 

Arnautovic fired over a corner from the right, Crouch rose above a static Luke Shaw to head goalwards and Shawcross was completely unmarked to turn and hook the ball home.

‘We’ve had two meetings about that,’ said Van Gaal. ‘We know that Crouch is doing that and they were totally free without any opponent in the neighbourhood so that was very bad.’

If there was one consolation for United, this was the kind of game they would have lost last season. In fact they did, a 2-1 defeat by Hughes’s side in February still their only loss in 14 Premier League encounters with Stoke.

They lost Phil Jones and Jonny Evans to injuries before half-time that day, and both players had a bumpy ride alongside Chris Smalling in the first half here. Stoke used the wind to hang up long balls and asked Mame Biram Diouf and Crouch to chase down United’s back-three.

Evans, in particular, almost paid for the price for allowing Arnautovic’s punt to bounce several times towards his own penalty box in the 19th minute, inviting Diouf to muscle him off the ball and go through on goal.

It was an excellent chance for the former United striker to double Stoke’s lead but he curled a shot well wide of David de Gea’s goal.

Manchester United will make a decision about the option to buy Radamel Falcao in April and not in the next few days.

‘He made a bit of a mess of it and I was thankful for that,’ admitted a relieved Evans. ‘The ball kept holding up in the wind and you had to break your stride sometimes to let it drop. I said to Mame Diouf, “Is it like this every week?” and he said it is.’

United were level seven minutes later and it infuriated Hughes that his old club scored from a corner of their own.

Wayne Rooney swung over a cross from the left, Michael Carrick managed to flick the ball on and Falcao was lurking on the edge of the six-yard box to guide it past Asmir Begovic.

It was the Colombian’s third goal in 12 games for United and, surprisingly, Carrick’s first Premier League assist since Boxing Day 2012.

Van Gaal sent on Adnan Januzaj and Ander Herrera for Falcao and Shaw, but that was the precursor to a period of ferocious Stoke precious that should have brought a winner.

After Jones was forced to head narrowly wide of his own goal, the resulting corner from Arnautovic picked out Crouch who headed goalwards.

The ball clearly hit Smalling’s outstretched left arm from some distance but referee Michael Oliver waved away Stoke’s furious claims for a penalty.

Michael Carrick's flick-on for Falcao’s goal was his first Premier League assist since Boxing Day 2012. 

Moments later, Crouch beat Smalling to Arnautovic’s freekick and flicked a header towards the back post with De Gea beaten.

Agonisingly, it came back off the post and Diouf’s follow-up effort went over the bar.

‘I think Stoke were closer to the victory with the ball on the post, and the first chance from Diouf was also not a little chance,’ conceded Van Gaal. ‘So they had two major chances and we didn’t create so much in spite of the time and space.

‘But it’s more difficult because we are not so tall. (Steven) Nzonzi is taller and Crouch is taller, so it’s not so easy. The opponent is always taller than us.’

So can we expect United to sign some taller players in the transfer window?

‘No,’ he replied. ‘We want to play another kind of football to Stoke City.’
