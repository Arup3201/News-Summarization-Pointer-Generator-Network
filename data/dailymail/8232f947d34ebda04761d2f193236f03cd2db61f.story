Older women were mostly likely to die as a result of freezing temperatures

High fuel bills were held partly to blame yesterday for a huge surge in winter-related deaths.

The number of excess winter deaths soared by almost a third last year, official figures revealed.

The data, which compares deaths in winter months with averages in other seasons, found an extra 31,100 people died, mostly as a result of cold weather and flu.

Critics said it was a ‘damning indictment’ of high fuel bills and cold homes.

The 29 per cent rise in excess deaths occurred against a background of soaring gas and electricity prices, which left millions worried about whether to spend on heating or eating.

Most victims were 75 and over, and had medical conditions, such as heart and lung problems, made worse by the cold.

Last year’s harsh winter was clearly a factor, along with high fuel bills and the fact that British homes are far colder and less insulated than those in many other parts of Europe.

The NHS is to provide an extra 2,500 hospital beds and 3,000 staff to help prevent a crisis in A&E this winter.

Age UK’s charity director Caroline Abrahams said: ‘Excess winter deaths are preventable and today’s figures are a damning indictment of our failure to address the scandal of cold homes in this country.’

The Office for National Statistics figures showed that the highest winter death rate was in the North West and the lowest in London, with women making up 58 per cent of the total.

Temperatures plunged across Britain at the start of this year, with March the coldest record since 1962 with an average monthly temperature of just 2.6C (36.7F).

The ONS said: 'Winter 2012-13 was characterised by a milder than average December, followed by a prolonged period of lower than average temperatures.

'The number of deaths peaked in the 
first week of January, which coincided with a peak in rates of 
influenza-like illness over the Christmas weeks.

'The mean number of daily deaths was higher than average for a prolonged period between February and April 2013.'

More women died as a result of the cold (18,000) compared to 13,100 men.

Notably the number of deaths peaked in the first week of January, as many people were struck down with flu over Christmas.

The mean number of daily deaths was also higher than average for a prolonged period between February and April 2013.

The ONS said excess winter mortality 
for 2012/13 was highest in the North West of England and lowest in 
London - which bucks the trend of the previous year when the highest 
excess winter death rates were observed in the capital.

Labour's
 shadow public health minister Luciana Berger said: 'It is appalling 
that thousands of people are dying unnecessarily in Britain today.

'On
 the brink of another cold winter, England’s A&Es are already in 
crisis. The Government’s severe cuts to elderly care mean support is 
being withdrawn from homes and hundreds of thousands more older people 
are turning to hospital - they deserve much better.

'A
 third of these excess deaths are caused by people living in homes that 
are too cold. This winter, David Cameron’s failure to stand up to the 
energy companies will leave too many people forced to choose between 
heating and eating.

'Ministers need to take urgent action and back Labour's plans to freeze energy bills.'

Health officials are calling for an army of good
samaritans to care for the nation's elderly this winter.

NHS England wants 100,000 people to sign a pledge saying
they will look in on an elderly friend or neighbour over the coming months.

Actress Joanna Lumley (pictured) was the first person to become a 'Winter Friend' and sign
the online pledge, which reads: 'I will take time out this winter to look
in on an elderly friend or neighbour to make sure they are warm and coping
well.'

She said: 'A little help really does go a long way.
You will also find, I'm sure, that giving a bit of your time in this way is
hugely rewarding.

'Older people can be physically frail but they have a
lifetime's wisdom and experience to share.

Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt today gave details of how an extra £250 million for struggling A&E units will be spent this winter.

He said 'winter is tough' but that the extra resources will make sure patients 'get the excellent care they expect, no matter what season it is'.

Almost 2,500 extra beds will be made available across England as a result of the funding, first announced in August.

The equivalent of almost 3,000 extra staff will be brought in to help the NHS cope with winter pressures, the Department of Health said.

This consists of temporary staff, extending the hours of existing staff and creating new positions.

The majority of the funding was distributed earlier this year to 53 areas where hospitals were identified as being under the most pressure.

The Department of Health said the extra staff is the equivalent of up to 320 extra doctors and 1,400 extra nurses, as well as up to 1,200 other NHS staff including physiotherapists and occupational therapists.

A further £150million was announced by NHS England last week to help other health trusts cope with the cold weather.

Mr Hunt said: 'The NHS is performing well and more than 95 per cent of patients are being seen in our A&E departments in under four hours. However, we know that cold weather affects our health and has an impact on the NHS every year.

'Winter is tough, but the NHS has never been better prepared.'

The ONS said there were 18,000 winter-related female deaths, a rise from 13,610 the previous year.

Meanwhile, the number of excess male deaths was 13,100 - a rise from 10,590 observed in 2011/12.

'In common with other countries, in England and Wales more people die in the winter than in the summer,' the report adds.

'In 2012-13 19.6 per cent more people 
died in the winter months compared with the non-winter months, up from 
15.5 per cent in 2011-12.'

Dot Gibson, general secretary of the National Pensioners' Convention, said: 'This is a national scandal which the government seems incapable of doing anything about.

'Making sure older people have got a well insulated warm home and the income to pay the fuel bills isn’t green crap. It’s what a decent society should do.

'How can colder Scandinavian countries avoid this annual toll while we simply wring our hands?

'The government needs to roll out a more effective programme to insulate homes, build more suitable properties for older people, raise the winter fuel allowance and tackle the excessive profits of the big six energy companies.'
