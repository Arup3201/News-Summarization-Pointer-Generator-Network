The man struck by media owner Alexander Lebedev could have suffered a life-threatening injury if it were not for his 'physical shape and paratrooper training', a Russian court heard today.

Sergei Polonsky, 40, claimed that the newspaper baron 'hit me with his fist three times in my head' in testimony that the judge must consider in deciding whether to jail the tycoon for up to five years for 'hooliganism motivated by political hatred'.

The notorious incident came in a TV talk show in 2011 after which the former KGB spy - who bought the Independent titles and London Evening Standard - claimed he acted in self-defence fearing he was about to be hit.

Polonsky alleged that 53-year-old 
Lebedev - an ex-KGB spy once based in London - used 'specialised 
training and martial arts skills' during the sudden attack. 

But there was also farce at the 
Moscow trial yesterday as the judge permitted property magnate 
Polonsky's absence from the trial based on the fact he is on bail in 
Cambodia and barred from leaving that country amid allegations he 
assaulted a group of sailors and held them captive using a knife.

However, there is growing evidence 
that he absented himself from Cambodia around two months ago, and that 
he is now in Israel, possibly in the area of Yavne, having earlier spent
 time in Switzerland and Luxembourg.

As judge Andrei Bakhvalov ruled that 
Polonsky could not get out of Cambodia for 'extraordinary 
circumstances', he tweeted a picture this week showing him smiling and 
sitting in a wooden bath, possibly in a sauna, captioned 'Good morning 
Earth people'. Another shows him riding a bike. 

A reliable source independent of 
Lebedev has told Mail Online that he is in Israel as Lebedev's lawyers 
argued that his rights were flouted if he could not challenge his 
accuser in court.

Lebedev told the judge yesterday: 'I can provide information on where Polonsky is in several days, your honour.'

Excuse: Mr Polonsky is said to be unable to attend the trial as he is stuck in Cambodia

Despite this, the claim by Polonsky to have been hit three times by Lebedev may be significant in convicting him.

Analysts fear a behind the scene 
campaign by the Kremlin for his foes to lock him up after his Russian 
newspaper Novaya Gazeta carried a series of anti-corruption campaigns. 

Under Russian law, three - as 
distinct from two - punches could be a key factor in permitting the 
judge to hand down a long sentence. 

'Because of the sudden Lebedev attack
 and strong punches I sustained, I fell off with a chair behind the 
podium,' said Polonsky in written testimony soon after the event.

'Fortunately, thanks to my physical shape and paratrooper training, I managed to avoid major injury.'

He could easily have hit his head on 
metal objects in the studio, and but for his training he could have 
suffered 'life and health threatening injuries'.

'Lebedev's punches were purposefully 
to a sensitive part of the head, the temples, and these  punches could 
have had unpredictable consequences, taking into consideration my 
dangerous fall with my head down,' he added.

In the event, Polonsky was knocked off his chair, and suffered some bruises and torn trousers but was relatively unscathed.

While Polonsky's statement accuses 
Lebedev of 'hooliganism' he does not appear to claim any political 
motivation in the attack, yet this is specifically what the Russian 
state alleges that he committed.  

He did, however, call him 'an MP who 
resorted to hooliganism'. Lebedev is no longer a national politician but
 is a deputy in a regional parliament in Russia. 

Polonsky quoted Lebedev after the incident saying he had 'neutralised' him.

Polonsky said he did not hit back.'I did not succumb to provocations, and didn't cross the line.'

Genri Reznik, Lebedev's lawyer, criticised the failure to insist on Polonsky appearing at the trial.

This amounted to 'depriving Mr Lebedev from the right to properly protect himself.'

The trial resumes on Friday when the media tycoon is expected to call his witnesses.
