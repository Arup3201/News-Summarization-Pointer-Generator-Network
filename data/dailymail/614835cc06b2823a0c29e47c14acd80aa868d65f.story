Harriet Wran, the daughter of former NSW premier Neville Wran, had been on a days-long drug binge before a man was stabbed to death in a run-down Sydney unit.

Wran appeared in Liverpool Local Court on Thursday charged with murder, attempted murder and break and enter.

Court documents confirmed Wran was an ice addict who had been living rough in Sydney's inner city suburbs of Surry Hills and Redfern after leaving her family's luxury Woollahra home in the weeks before the killing.

Daily Mail Australia understands Wran, 26, told police she was 'numb on ice' at the time of the attack in the inner-Sydney suburb of Redfern on Sunday and had been 'off her guts for days'.

She told them she went to the address because she was desperate to buy drugs but never thought co-accused Lloyd Haines, 29, or Michael Lee, 35, 'would do what they did', allegedly as part of $70 drug deal gone wrong.

Wran claimed she 'froze' at the time but did what she was told because she was terrified of Haines and Lee.

Wran didn't apply for bail and it was formally refused. She did not appear in the dock but her lawyer Winston Terracini SC said she would plead not guilty. The matter was adjourned until October 8. She will be held in Silverwater jail.

Haines was refused bail on Wednesday and is due to reappear at Central Local Court on October 9. Lee will reappear on October 8.

Court documents showed Wran was unemployed and received a Newstart Allowance of $560 per fortnight from Centrelink.

Police will allege Daniel McNulty, 45, is suspected of having been a drug dealer and was stabbed two times on Sunday night, once in the left knee and once in the back, which fatally punctured his lung.

Sources say McNulty was not known to Wran before the attack.

As well as McNulty, a second man, Brett Fitzgerald, 42, was stabbed several times in the attack and remains in a stable condition at St Vincent's Hospital.

Haines' arrest came after Fitzgerald told police the attack had been carried out by three people in their 30s and 40s.

Friends of McNulty have paid tribute to the musician on Facebook, the Sydney Morning Herald reports.

'Your sharp wit, world observations, humour and brilliant dance moves will be missed my friend. Rest in Peace,' one said.

'Daniel was a funny, talented and gifted musician who had an on going battle with addiction,' another wrote.

Wran is part of Australia's wealthy establishment royalty, the daughter of one of the nation's most celebrated political leaders and his glamorous academic second wife, nee Jill Hickson.

She was born in 1988 into a privileged existence created by her barrister turned politician father who had come from humble beginnings in the then Sydney working class suburb of Balmain.

She attended prestigious private schools Ascham in Edgecliff and Sydney Church of England Girls Grammar School (SCEGGS) in Darlinghurst before studying modern history at the University of Sydney.

Mr Wran was the son of a seaman and coal lumper who ended up as a Queen's Counsel to the NSW bar, premier of the state and an icon of the Australian Labor Party.Â

On Sunday, emergency crews arrived at a unit block on Walker Street about 7.45pm and found a man with multiple stab wounds.

Following investigations, a red 1998 model Toyota sedan was located by police in the Waterloo region about 3pm on Wednesday.

Superintendent Luke Freudenstein on Monday said the attack, while not pre-meditated, was not random either.

It is not yet clear what motivated the stabbings, but it is likely the attackers knew the victims and the violence may have escalated from an argument, police said at the time.

Neighbours reported hearing screams and yelling.

A senior police source told The Sydney Morning Herald Wran was believed to have ties with Sydney's drug scene.

A friend - who did not wish to be named - said the 26-year-old started seeing a bikie when her relationship with an architect ended.

At her father's funeral, Ms Wran wore long sleeves to cover up the tattoos had on her arms.

'I would be very surprised if Neville had any idea,' the friend told The Sydney Morning Herald.

A state funeral was held for Ms Wran's father who was premier of NSW between 1976 and 1986, on May 1 in Sydney after his death in April this year.

Harriet Wran was at his side when the brilliant and controversial Australian politician died.

She is the first child of the second marriage of the most electorally successful politician and premier of NSW, with Jill Hickson who was to become a prominent publishing figure.

In 1976, at 50 years of age, former barrister Neville Wran rose to become the most powerful man in the state.

Harriet Wran will be represented by one of Australia's top lawyers, Winston Terracini, when she appears in court.

The 26-year-old has turned to the best criminal silk to fight her murder charge, the Daily Telegraph reports.

He specialises in complex murder and manslaughter cases and is renowned for his cross-examination skills.

His former clients include Gordon Wood, who was acquitted of the murder of his girlfriend Caroline Byrne in 2012, and Keli Lane, the former Australian water polo player who was convicted of the 1996 murder of her newborn baby Tegan.

The criminal barrister recently represented millionaire property mogul Ron Medich who was accused of ordering the murder of his former business associate Michael McGurk.

Months later, he married then-Qantas executive Hickson, following his divorce from his first wife Marcia, with whom he had a daughter, Kim, and an adopted son, Glenn.

The marriage to Jill Hickson created controversy as did Mr Wran's premiership which resulted in corruption allegations which overshadowed Neville 'Nifty' Wran's entire premiership.

Jill Hickson Wran gave birth to Harriet in 1988 and Hugo in 1991.

Mr Wran agonised over being an 'older father' to his second family, but his children Harriet and Hugo were reportedly devoted to him as he retired from public life and entered his senior years.

In 2006, Jill and Neville separated, and their marriage suffered upheavals over the next few years before they reconciled in 2011, not long before Mr Wran moved to an aged care facility in Sydney's eastern suburbs favoured by former political powerhouse leaders, Lulworth House at Elizabeth Bay.

Neville Wran reportedly suffered dementia before his death, aged 87, in April this year.

Harriet Wran and her brother, Hugo, accompanied their mother Jill to the public memorial for their father's life in Sydney Town Hall.

Following her father's death, Harriet Wran became a factor in a reportedly contested will between Jill Hickson and Neville Wran's four children Kim, Glenn, from his first marriage, and Harriet and Hugo, who are believed to be the main beneficiaries of his multimillion-dollar estate.

The inheritance is said to include prime real estate - including a home in the exclusive Sydney suburb of Woollahra, a beach house in the multimillion dollar property location of Palm Beach and a farm in the Yarramalong Valley on the NSW Central Coast.
