Floyd Mayweather Jnr and Manny Pacquiao met for over an hour on Tuesday night in a bid to hammer out the details of their proposed $300million (£200m) mega-fight.

Mayweather visited Pacquiao in his Miami hotel suite for what was described as a 'very pleasant and very encouraging' discussion.

The pair had earlier sat on opposite sides of a basketball court as Miami Heat took on the Milwaukee Bucks in the NBA.

Fight fans will be hoping the exchange leads to the mega-bout the world is waiting for

They talked briefly at half-time and exchanged phone numbers during what was their first ever face-to-face conversation.

The fight has been in the works for almost six years but appears close to being agreed for the MGM Grand in Las Vegas on May 2.

'That's the first time they ever sat eye to eye,' Pacquiao's adviser Michael Konz told ESPN.

'They talked at half-time, but this was a longer, more serious meeting. You could tell by their body language that this was very positive. It was for a good hour or more.

'It was a business meeting but it wasn't a tense business meeting. I think that's because they both have mutual respect for each other. We'll determine what will happen over the next couple of days.'

Konz also revealed that Mayweather voiced concern over two broadcasting issues during the meeting. Pacquiao is under contract with HBO while Mayweather has two fights remaining on his six-fight deal with Showtime.

It is expected a joint pay-per-view broadcast will be agreed, similar to the arrangement for Lennox Lewis' heavyweight clash with Mike Tyson in 2002.

Pacquiao's was only at the basketball match after his flight to New York was delayed due to the blizzard that has hit the east coast.

The Filipino was in Miami on Sunday to judge the Miss Universe pageant and has set a deadline of January 31 for Mayweather to agree terms.

The closest they came to doing so was in early 2010 when Pacquiao refused to sign up to Olympic-style drug testing.
