It has been nearly 10 years since Jerry Carswell died suddenly while having treatment for kidney stones - but his wife claims she is still waiting for the hospital to return his heart.

Mystery continues to surround exactly what happened to the former high school teacher's heart after he died unexpectedly at Christus St Catherine Hospital in Katy, Texas in 2004.

His wife Linda claims the hospital continues to hold on to the organ, an allegation hotly denied by the hospital, which says it only ever removed a small sample to conduct an autopsy.

Following her husband's death, the hospital had promised Mrs Carswell 
that a full autopsy would be conducted to establish the exact causes.

The mother-of-two claims that when the body was returned to her for burial, the heart was 
retained by the hospital.

A prolonged court battle has been raging ever since, which resulted in Christus being ordered to hand over $2million to Mrs Carswell in 2010 for medical malpractice.

A jury ruled it had fraudulently obtained Mrs Carswell's permission to conduct an autopsy that she later found to be incomplete.

The hospital was cleared of causing his death through negligence.

But despite having to pay the financial compensation, Mrs Carswell claims the hospital remained in possession of the missing organ.

The hearing also upheld much of the 2010 judgement.

Mystery: The reasons Mr Carswell's death, at Christus St Catherine Hospital, have never been established

Mrs Carswell's lawyer, Neil McCabe, said the heart on its own could not prove Mr Carswell, who was a state championship-winning high school track coach, had died wrongfully.

But according to The Huffington Post, his client would like to bury it beside her husband's body.

Speaking to Houston television station KTRK, Mrs Carswell said: 'As
a family we can respectfully bury Jerry and come to some sort of 
closure that we've done the right thing for the person we love.'

According to Propublica website, the cause of Mr Carswell's death has never been established.

In 2011, they claimed lawyers for the hospital did not want to return the heart, claiming it could be used as evidence if ever there was a retrial.

In a statement, Christus said: 'It has been claimed that, without his family’s consent, Mr Carswell’s heart was removed during autopsy and that he was buried without it.

'However, the jury ruled otherwise, specifically finding that neither Christus nor the independent pathologist who performed the autopsy improperly retained any organ or portion of any organ from Mr Carswell’s body.

'Instead, a tissue sample from Mr. Carswell’s heart was retained by an independent pathologist, pursuant to written consent given by Mrs. Carswell.'

The statement added: 'Tissue samples taken during an autopsy are extremely small, and a deceased person’s body remains essentially intact for burial.'

Christus said in a 
statement that it would appeal the issue of whether it 
fraudulently got Mrs Carswell's permission for the autopsy to the 
Texas Supreme Court.

But spokeswoman Abby Lowe McNeil said Christus would not file any more motions related to Mr Carswell's heart tissue.

St Joseph Medical Center said to KTRK that it would cooperate fully provided there were no more medical interventions.

Mr McCabe said he is continuing to work with St Joseph's management to retrieve the heart.
