A 24-year-old man has been arrested and charged for shooting dead the police chief of a small Texas town.

Joshua Manuel Lopez faces charges of capital murder in the death of Elmford Police Chief Michael Pimental, who pulled Lopez over on Saturday on an active warrant for graffiti.

Pimentel was shot twice - once in the shoulder and once in the abdomen - and was pronounced dead at the hospital.

Pimental - who was in his 60s and has served as police chief in Elmendorf for more than a year - is believed to have been killed in the street of the small town of 1,500 people, located about 25 miles southeast of San Antonio.

Exact details of the shooting have not been released.

The incident happened near East 9th Street and South 1st Avenue at around 11:40am.

Pimentel was flown to University Hospital, where he was pronounced dead.

Elmendorf Mayor Evelyn Lykins said in a news release that the person who was the subject of the arrest warrant that Pimentel was serving opened fire on the chief.

'He embraced the community of Elmendorf not only as its head of law enforcement officer but also as a resident. We will miss him,' the mayor said.

Steve McCraw, head of the Texas Department of Public Safety, said Pimentel is the fifth law enforcement officer to die in Texas this year.

Pimental, who was in his 60s, had served as the police chief of small Texas town Elmendorf for about a year

Three of the five were killed by gunfire.

Some 13 officers died in the line of duty last year.

'Every day police officers throughout the state risk their lives to protect their communities, and tragically sometimes they make the ultimate sacrifice,' McCraw said.

Investigators are looking into Lopez's background.

Lopez remained in the Bexar County Adult Detention Center on a $1 million bond Sunday. Information about whether he has an attorney was unavailable.
