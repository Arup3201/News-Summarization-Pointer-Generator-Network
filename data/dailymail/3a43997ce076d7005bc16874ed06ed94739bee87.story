The husband of a well-respected doctor and mother of a six-year-old girl bought cyanide just two days before her death, it was revealed today.

Autumn Marie Klein, 41, collapsed at her
Oakland, Pennsylvania home and died on April 20 at UPMC Presbyterian, 
where she also headed the women's neurology department.

Husband Dr. Robert Ferrante told authorities and his wife's family that she had suffered a stroke, but investigators found her body had more than 30 times the lethal level of cyanide in her system.

It has now been revealed that Ferrante, who is a medical expert at the University of Pittsburgh, used his work credit card to purchase cyanide just two days before his wife's death.

Ferrante's attorney Bill Difenderfer told KDKA that his client uses cyanide as part of his job as a professor at the university.

However police say the purchase of the poison so close to Klein's death is part of their investigation and they are preparing to execute several more warrants in the case, as they look for further evidence.

Detectives have traveled to Boston and
Baltimore in the past week as they investigate the background of 
Dr. Ferrante and his wife, Dr. Klein.

Sources close to the investigation say Dr. Ferrante
appears to be devastated by his loss and maintains his innocence, 
however he was unwilling to speak to KDKA when they approached him.

The couple have a six-year-old daughter called Cianna.

As well as heading the women's neurology department at UPMC, Klein was also a mother of six-year-old daughter called Cianna

Dr. Ferrante called 911 and reported that his wife had a heart attack on April 20th.

Sources say 'extremely high levels of
cyanide' were found in Dr. Klein’s blood. The type of levels that would
have “knocked her to the floor” in 30 seconds sources say.

Colleagues were in shock at the loss of the
young and valued colleague who had quickly become an 
acknowledged leader in treating pregnant women suffering 
neurological diseases.

This is an irreplaceable loss,' said
Robert Friedlander, chairman of neurological surgery at UPMC, who 
recruited Dr. Klein in 2011.

Lawrence
Wechsler, chairman of the neurology department at UPMC, added: 'Autumn 
was a pioneer as well as a caring doctor, wonderful teacher, researcher 
and mentor.’

She moved to Pittsburgh with her 
husband, Robert Ferrante, a leading researcher in ALS and 
Huntington's disease from Harvard Medical School, who was also recruited by 
Friedlander to become a Pitt professor of neurological surgery.

Autumn Marie Klein, 41, collapsed at her Oakland, Pennsylvania home and died on April 20 at UPMC Presbyterian

The
victim’s mother Cook Klein, 79, had been due to fly to Pennsylvania from her
home in Towson, Maryland to babysit for her daughter she her son-in-law
broke the news that Autumn had been rushed to hospital.

Initially she was told her daughter may 
have suffered a stroke. When she heard about the cyanide, her first 
concern was for her granddaughter and who would pick her up from school if 
police needed to speak to her father.

Police told her that Cianna was with her father.

Paying tribute to her daughter, Cook Klein described her as a ‘wonderful human being and a fantastic mother’

‘I don't know of anybody that would have a reason to try to hurt her,’ she said.

In addition to her husband, daughter and mom, Autumn is survived by her father William Klein; a stepdaughter, Kimberly Ferrante of San Diego; and a stepson, Michael Ferrante of Boston.
