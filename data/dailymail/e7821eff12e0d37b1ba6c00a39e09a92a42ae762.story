Prince Charles has combined his love of the environment with his passion for painting and the results are available for all to enjoy on his public website.

The exhibition of 130 watercolour paintings of the British and Scottish countryside has gone on display in a collection called Life in Pictures at www.princeofwales.gov.uk.

Each painting was personally chosen for display by the Prince and the collection represents the largest public collection of his work ever seen in one place.

The collection includes many paintings of the Royal residencies like this one of Highgrove House which the Prince painted in 1999

Featuring scenes of the views from the Balmoral estate, paintings of the Royal residences such as Highgrove and Sandringham, as well as Scottish landscapes such as Lochnagar mountain, the paintings clearly reflect the His Highnesses love of nature and Englsih heritage.

There are also albums from the private holidays that the Prince took to Greece and to Klosters in Switzerland, as well as paintings done while on Royal tours overseas in Turkey and Tanzania, and sketches made on board HMS Britannia.

The copyright of The Prince’s watercolours belongs to A. G. Carrick Ltd, a trading arm of The Prince’s Charities Foundation. The name uses two of The Prince's four Christian names - Arthur and George - and one of his titles, The Earl of Carrick.

Prince Charles has painted for decades, inspired in the 1970s and 80s by his art master at Gordonstoun in Scotland Robert Waddel.

Mainly focusing on landscapes and nature scenes, he has previously displayed his work, giving any money generated goes to the The Prince of Wales's Charitable Foundation.

The Prince has often shared his love of art with the public and recently contributed to a documentary, ‘Royal Paintbox’ on Royal artists throughout history.

In the 1980s The Prince began inviting artists to accompany him on official tours overseas and record their impressions, a tradition that has continued to this day, and he has founded an arts school to nurture the art of drawing from observation.

The Prince paints many scenes of his beloved Scotland, such as this one of an abandoned cottage on the island of Stroma, 2003

The Prince's Drawing School was founded by His Royal Highness and artist Catherine Goodman in 2000, and it is now one of the few institutions that offers specific and sustained tutition to people wishing to learn how to draw.

Clarence House say: ‘The Prince has been an enthusiastic amateur artist and keen collector and Patron of the Arts for many years. 

‘The Prince likes to paint whenever his schedule allows - whether on private holidays, or during a spare moment on an overseas tour - and finds it a most absorbing occupation.

‘These watercolours provide an insight into not only The Prince's artistic interpretation of his environment, but into his private and public life.’
