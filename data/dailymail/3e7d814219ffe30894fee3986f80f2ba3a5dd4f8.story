In Steven Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan, four brothers fight in the Second World War – and only one comes out alive.

But there is a British family that can go not only one, but five better.

And in the case of the Windsor brothers, all nine lived to tell the tale.

What's more, one of the siblings also fought in the First World War, along with two older brothers.

The record-breaking contribution by the Windsor family of North London to the battle against Hitler had been largely forgotten.

It was only rediscovered by 68-year-old Bob Windsor as he researched his family tree.

He knew that both his father Albert 
and an uncle Wally served in the war but a visit to the 90-year-old 
Wally revealed the true scale of the family's contribution.

He discovered how Albert – 41 when he 
enlisted – signed up at the same time as Jim, 37, Harry, 35, Bill, 33, 
Arthur, 31, Tom, 30, Dick, 27, Sid, 23 and Wally, 18.

Albert and three brothers served in 
the Army while four served in the RAF, with Dick serving in the Royal 
Navy. Mr Windsor made the discovery when he spotted a framed Guinness 
World Records' certificate on the wall of his Uncle Wally's home.

It acknowledged that Albert and eight younger brothers held the record for the most siblings to fight in the Second World War.

Mr Windsor said: 'It makes me 
intensely proud. The fact is, this record is never going to be beaten. 
Big families are a thing of the past.

'It's a shame I never knew about the amazing story. My father and his brothers just grew apart over the years.

'They never thought it was particularly exceptional that they had all fought in the war – they saw it as just doing their duty.

'They also never knew about the award. It was Wally's son who notified Guinness about the record.'

He said he feared the worst as he delved into the family's past and and into why his father and uncles had all drifted apart.

'I was expecting to find some dark tale of murder or scandal but instead made this wonderful discovery,' he said.

'Every time I think about it, it just hits me how much of an amazing story this really is.'

He said he had not managed to find out
all the details of the brothers' war service, but added: 'I do know 
that Sid bumped into Wally while out in India.

'Apparently Sid tapped him on the 
shoulder and said “All right mate, remember me?”.' Mr Windsor's 
grandparents George and Martha had 13 sons and three daughters.

The three eldest boys – George, 
Charles and Albert – fought in the First World War. Charles was killed 
in action on May 17, 1917, during the Arras offensive in northern France
and is buried there.

His loss did not stop the younger boys
joining up in 1939 to fight in the next global conflict. The Windsors' 
stellar war effort was not restricted to the men at the front.

George and tenth child Alfred could 
not enlist, and were involved in munitions production. Another boy 
Edward, died aged just seven in 1922.

Bob, lives with his wife Meg, 66, in the village of Six Mile Bottom, Cambridgeshire.

An extract from The Buffalo Evening News from July 8, 1944, covering the tragedy of the Niland brothers

Steven Spielberg's 1998 epic Saving Private Ryan tells the story of a WWII mission in Normandy to find paratrooper James Ryan (played by Matt Damon) - the last surviving of four soldier brothers - and return him to his family.

Although a work of fiction, the story was based on the Sole Survivor policy, introduced by the U.S. War Department in 1942.

It was brought in to prevent an entire generation of serving relatives being wiped out - a decision taken following the tragedy of the five Sullivan brothers.

When the USS Juneau was sunk in November, 1942, in the South Pacific, it led to the deaths of the five boys from Waterloo, Iowa.

When they signed up, brothers George, 27, Francis, 26, Joseph 24, Madison, 23, and Albert, 20 had insisted that they not be separated.

Tragically, following the torpedo attack, Francis, Joseph and Madison were instantly killed; Albert drowned a day later; while George lasted around four days on a life raft before disappearing.

However, it is believed that Spielberg's main source of inspiration came from the case of the Niland family.

Of the four brothers, just two survived the war - but it was believed at the time that only one, Frederick, had made it back alive.

Sergeant Frederick 'Fritz' Niland was a member of the 101st Airborne's 501st Parachute Infantry Regiment.

He was dropped into Normandy on June 6, 1944, landed near Carentan, and made his way back to the rest of his unit.

His three siblings, however, were in other units: Technical Sergeant Robert Niland with the 82nd Airborne Division (505th Parachute Infantry Regiment, Company D); Lieutenant Preston Niland with the 4th Infantry Division (22nd Infantry Regiment); and Technical Sergeant Edward Niland as a pilot in the Army Air Force.

In Normandy, Robert was killed on D-Day; and Preston died near Utah beach.

Edward, who had been shot down over Burma in May, 1944, was missing presumed dead.

In keeping with Sole Survivor, Fritz was sent home to his family in New York.

He would later learn that Edward had in fact spent a year in a Japanese PoW camp and was later rescued by the British.
