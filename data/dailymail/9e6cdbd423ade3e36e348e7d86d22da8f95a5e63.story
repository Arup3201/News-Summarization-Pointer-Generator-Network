A police chase ended in embarrassment for the officer when he crashed his car up an electricity pole instead of catching the suspect.

Jonathon Bond lost control of the car on Elvis Presley Boulevard in Memphis, Tennessee, while chasing a driver he suspected of not wearing a seatbelt.

Officer Bond caught a guide wire as he took a corner and sent the vehicle flying. Thankfully he was wearing his seatbelt and walked away uninjured.

He then took a photograph of the crash and sent it to his boss, Toney Armstrong, who opened the email during a meeting.

'I can certainly say that it was a little shocking to me to see one of my squad cars half way up a pole,' Armstrong, the director of Memphis police, told Wreg.com.

'Every time you get to a point on this job when you say I’ve seen absolutely everything, nothing could shock or surprise you, then you get something that shocks and surprises you.'

But passing drivers who slowed down to take a closer look were stung for their curiosity.
