Sunderland manager Gus Poyet has revealed he dropped Steven Fletcher a few weeks ago to fire him up — a strategy that paid dividends when the Scottish striker scored his first goals in almost 10 months on Saturday to give Sunderland their first win of the season.

Asked if he dropped the player to make him angry, Poyet said: ‘Yes, but I didn’t do it for that reason alone. I needed to change something. He was not very happy for a few days but there were no problems. 

'I am not a manager who will sit and accept things. You always try and help the team and I made a strong decision. It is not personal. It is always for the benefit of the team.’

Steven Fletcher had not scored any goal in 17 games stretching back to October last year before scoring twice against Stoke

‘The good thing is I am always looking for a way to win. It is not personal. It is always for the benefit of the team. We needed some presence in the box from players who really want to score. I needed hunger from players who wanted to score.’

Fletcher was the stand-out performer as he laid on Connor Wickham’s opener and then struck either side of the break after Charlie Adam had equalised.

‘It has been a frustrating time,’ Fletcher said. ‘I feel like I’ve been doing quite well in training so when you are not in the squad it is very frustrating but I’ve just had to keep my head down and take my chance when I got it and I did that.’

Sunderland had started the season with five draws and one defeat. ‘It’s massive that we are off the mark now,’ Fletcher said. ‘We have been putting in good performances but the results haven’t been coming. Everything came together for us today and it is a huge relief to get the win.’

On Fletcher’s reaction to being dropped, Poyet added: ‘He was not very happy for a few days and clearly didn’t like the decision. But there were no problems or complaints. Of course as a professional footballer he won’t be happy because he wants to play.

‘[The goals] told me he should be playing week in week out. It is good to know he can play like he did because his whole game not just the finishing is very good.’
