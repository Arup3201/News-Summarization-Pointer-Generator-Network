A military father has spoken of his fury at a video of his sergeant son being bludgeoned in the stomach by his superior officer as part of a bizarre hazing initiation.

Ken Roach, from Michigan, even wrote to Barack Obama in an attempt to obtain justice for his 22-year-old son Phillip.

The ritual 'initiating' 
Sgt. Roach to non-commissioned-officer's rank was filmed in April by
a superior at North Carolina's Fort Bragg, and first aired by WMMT News Channel 3 in Kalamazoo.

Vexing Video: The film depicts one of Sgt. Phillip Roach's superior officers hammering him in the gut with a wooden mallet

Newly Promoted: The hazing ritual was conducted to initiate Phillip Roach to an NCO's rank. He formerly was a specialist

Phillip's superior officer is shown  taking three practice swings at the newly-minted N.C.O's gut. Finally, the unidentified batsman delivers a brutal coup de grace that sent Phillip crumpling to 
the floor.

Phillip, who hails from Battle Creek, was not only bowled over by the blow, but badly whacked his head - first on a 
folding chair and then on the concrete floor, according to the shocking video.

He then suffered a seizure that required a hospital visit and that still has him 
unable to go airborne for the Army, Ken Roach has said.

Mr. Roach added that his son was an aviator, but is yet to be cleared by a doctor to return to his duties.

'That was assault with a deadly weapon,' Mr. Roach told WMMT.

'He could've killed my son and he 
should pay for it... I'm mad at the individuals who done it and who's 
trying to give a little slap on the wrist and say, "It's good to go. 
Let's just sweep it under the rug. Send him somewhere else and be done 
with it.'''

A Father's Fury: Ken Roach, who served in the U.S. Army from 1982 to 1990, dashed off a letter to President Obama concerning the affair

The wooden mallet's wielder reportedly received a $1,000 fine and a reprimand for simple assault.

Mr Roach has said he would like to see formal assault charges brought.

'I never thought in my wildest dreams I'd be contacted by anybody that my son had a seizure and was hit in the chest during a hazing incident,' he told the AP, adding that Phillip required six staples to close a head wound from the affair.

In response to his plea to Mr. Obama,
the elder Roach reportedly said he received a letter from 'someone in 
the president's office.'

The reply acknowledged the 
'unauthorized ceremony,' in which his son was injured, as well as called
it a 'clear incident of hazing that caused injury to a great soldier.'

Winding Up: The unidentified superior who wielded the mallet is shown in the video taking three measured practice swings at Roach's gut

A Vicious Swing: Roach's unidentified superior then whacks the 22-year-old seemingly as hard as he can in the abdomen

An Empty Handshake: The mallet's wielder then congratulates Roach with a handshake as the grimacing sergeant obviously fights through the resulting pain

But Mr Roach sneered that the punishment was a 'slap on the wrist' and said it was not good enough. Phillip has been a serviceman in the U.S. Army for five years. Mr. Roach, for his part, served from 1982 to 1990.

The father told the AP his son informed him during his junior year at Battle Creek Central High School that he wanted to join the Army 'so he could serve under the flag and fight for the freedom of the United States.'

Now, the elder Roach added to WMMT, 'There's a possibility that he may never be able to clear medically and be able to do his job and they could medically discharge him just because of this stupid hazing.'

Carl Levin, chair of the Senate Armed Services Committee, has released a statement asking the Army to review the case.

In Obvious Pain: After shaking hands with his superior, Phillip Roach doubles over in obvious pain from the blow

The Aftermath: Moments after he is slugged with the mallet, Roach doubles over in pain, supporting himself by laying both hands on a nearby table

Laid Out: Roach then falls to the concrete floor, first hitting his head on a folding chair and then on the hard surface. He suffered a seizure for which he had to be hospitalized

Phillip Roach is yet to be cleared for to resume his prior duties. The superior officer was fined $1,000 and cited for simple assault
