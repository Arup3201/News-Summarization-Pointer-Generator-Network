Bankers who used to work for Lehman Brothers are in line to collect a slice of the bonuses they were promised before the Wall Street institution collapsed, sparking the 2008 global financial crisis.

The administrator to Lehman's European operations has agreed to hand back an initial chunk of money to 1,582 creditors who are collectively seeking to recover £7billion.

They will get about 25p for every pound they are owed.

Lehman Brothers became one of the biggest casualties of the credit crunch after racking up billions in losses on sub-prime mortgages and commercial property investments.

But the prospect of bankers who are blamed for causing the financial crisis still profiting from their actions prompted criticism last night.

Deborah Hargreaves, director of the High Pay Centre, said: 'Bankers are always keen to help themselves. Surely, there are other more deserving creditors? After all, the bankers are the ones who caused the collapse in the first place.'

The first round of payments could be followed by others as PwC sells off assets and recovers money owed to Lehman before the bank went out of business,  which forced the US Treasury into its largest-ever financial bailout.

Around 650 smaller creditors with claims of less than £150,000 have already opted to accept PwC's offer of a one-off payment of 90p in the pound to settle.

Another 689 cases with a combined value of £1.3bn have yet to be agreed due to their complex trading relationships with Lehman.

PwC's Tony Lomas said: 'The payment of this significant dividend to such a large number of Lehman Brothers unsecured creditors is an important milestone for the administration.

'We look forward to returning a substantial amount of cash to creditors later this month.'

Lomas has described his work unravelling the finances of Lehman's European arm as a 'gargantuan task' and ten times more complicated than dealing with the bankruptcy of collapsed energy trader Enron.

The bank had around £670billion of trades outstanding with more than 7,000 counterparties – buyers and sellers. It operated through more than 200 separate companies across the world, with 36 registered in the UK alone.

Many of Lehman's 4,500 staff in the UK, mostly employed in London's Canary Wharf, lost their jobs despite Barclays and Nomura buying up parts of the collapsed firm, which was once one of Wall Street's most venerable institutions.

Most were also investors in the bank who saw the value of their holdings wiped out when it was decided to wind up the business.
