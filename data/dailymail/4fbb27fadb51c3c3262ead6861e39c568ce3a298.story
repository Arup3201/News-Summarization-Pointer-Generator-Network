Guilty: Paul Mosley helped plot the fire which killed six of Mick Philpott's children

He is Mick Philpott’s best friend and sidekick, with whom he shared women, drugs, and plotted the fire which killed six helpless children.

But Paul Mosley has a violent criminal history in his own right and has a violent past of his own.

Mosley - or Shakey, as he is known to friends –  was yesterday found guilty of six counts of manslaughter after Nottingham Crown Court heard he helped Philpott set the fatal house fire before fleeing the scene when police were called.

He was convicted after jurors heard officers found incriminating traces of petrol on his clothes from the night of the fire, which he had spent at the Philpott’s home. No petrol container was ever found because it is believed to have been handed from Philpott to Mosley through a front window before the fire was set.

Hours earlier he had a sordid threesome with the married couple and was, days later, taped receiving a sex act from Mrs Philpott in an attempt to keep him ‘onside’.

Mosley first faced a court in 1982 after, aged 15, he locked an old lady he had befriended in her cellar in order to steal £82 from her purse.

He was ordered to be detained for three years after he confessed that he had targeted 74-year-old widow Annabel Greenwood, one of the customers on his newspaper round.

He picked her up and manhandled her into the basement before ransacking her purse. He fled Derby by train but was arrested the next day in West Yorkshire after Mrs Greenwood managed to attract the attention of a delivery driver.

She died a year and a day after the robbery, from heart failure.

Marie Cope, Mrs Greenwood’s only child, said Mosley regularly ran errands for her mother, who suffered with arthritis.

Mrs Cope, 72, from Newmarket, Suffolk, said: ‘She was used to letting him in and used to give him money so he knew where her purse was. She was shocked when he turned on her and robbed her because she had trusted him.

‘He just lifted her up and put her in the cellar.’

In the following years, Mosley gained the nickname ‘Shakey’ – after he became scared during a fight and cowered indoors, shaking uncontrollably.

He was seen crying at the children’s funeral and attended the Philpotts’ first court hearing after they were charged with killing their children.

After he was first arrested in June, he bragged of being on bail for the deaths of the children. He was rearrested in November, after petrol was discovered on his clothes and a relative reported him talking of ‘rehearsing’ the blaze six weeks before it happened.

Mosley, who was friends with the Philpotts for 15 years and saw them almost every day, turned on Mick as he faced trial for killing the children.
