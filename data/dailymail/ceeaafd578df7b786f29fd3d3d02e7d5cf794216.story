The NYPD have launched an internal investigation after officers were caught posting pictures of themselves in full uniform on dating websites.

A spokesman confirmed to MailOnline today that an investigation is underway after cops were spotted showing off to prospective online dates in their uniforms, posing next to patrol cars and motorcycles.

Despite several officers' profiles being taken down since the flaunting of NYPD rules emerged, others are still looking for love on sites such as Match.com and OkCupid.

In a statement to MailOnline on 
Tuesday, John J. McCarthy, NYPD Deputy Commissioner, said: 'Members of 
the Police Department are prohibited from posting photographs of 
themselves in uniform without the prior authorization.

'This
does not include photographs taken during official department 
ceremonies. This directive is in compliance with the New York City 
Social Media Policy and is in part intended to protect officers from 
divulging identifying information on social media sites that may 
endanger officer safety. 

'Members of the service found to be in violation of the order may be subject to disciplinary action.'  

A spokeswoman repeated this statement 
today adding that the NYPD does not allow officers to post pictures on 
major sites such as match.com, OkCupid and eHarmony.

The NYPD is also clamping down on more specialized sites such as uniformdating.com and meetsinglepoliceofficers.com.

Among the hastily-deleted profiles, are a 29-year-old Brooklyn officer with a penchant for rock music, snacks and 'girls with respect for themselves'.

However other cops are still actively looking for love, including one 34-year-old cop from Howard Beach, New York whose posed up on OkCupid next to his patrol car. 

There has been criticism that the NYPD could 
make better use of its resources fighting real cyber-crime rather than 
the department's Romeos.

New York's Finest are not the only ones hoping to lure ladies with their heroic jobs.

Man in uniform: Dating websites are full of profiles featuring prospective dates in their military uniforms and on base

Profiles for U.S. Marines and firemen have been spotted on dating sites with pictures in full uniform and on duty.

In one Match.com profile for a 
33-year-old fireman from the Bronx, the romantic hopeful is pictured in 
front of his fire truck, wearing a safety harness.

In another on OkCupid, a 23-year-old 
U.S. Marine poses in fatigues, telling potential dates that 'music is 
passion in the form of sound'.

Another 25-year-old from West Hempstead, NY posted pictures in uniform and of military helicopters on his dating profile page.

A public affairs spokesman for the Marine Corps told MailOnline: 'There is nothing against Marines appearing in uniform so long as they do not undermine good order and discipline, bring discredit on the Marine Corps, or violate uniform regulations.

'If a violation is found, any punishment or counseling is decided on by the Marine's commanding officer on a case-by-case basis.'

MailOnline has contacted the New York City Fire Department on several occasions and is still waiting for a response.
