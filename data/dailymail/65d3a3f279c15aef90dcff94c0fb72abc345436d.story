While most players have returned to their clubs to begin a toiling pre-season, Bacary Sagna was enjoying the last of his holiday with wife Ludivine.

The former Arsenal right back has been granted extended leave following his exertions for France at the World Cup before joining up with new club Manchester City.

The 31-year-old was pictured taking a dip with his beautiful wife - wearing matching pink swimsuits - on a beach in Miami.

'I’m going to clear everything up because I keep reading that I did it for money and I’m greedy,' he said.

'What I want to say is I have stayed with Arsenal on the same contract since 2008 and I never asked for more money.

'For
 people who think it’s for money, it’s not. I just wanted to change. I 
needed a boost in my career and I think it was about time.

'It
 was not an easy time because we were still involved in the FA Cup and 
it was hard to stay focused. I stayed focused on my team because I have a
 lot of respect for Arsenal.’
