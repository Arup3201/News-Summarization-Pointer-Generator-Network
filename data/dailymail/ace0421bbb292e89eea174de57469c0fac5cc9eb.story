Footage has emerged from deep inside the mysterious crater that has suddenly appeared in Siberia.

The crater on the Yamal Peninsula - known as the 'end of the world' to locals - was caused by aliens, a meteorite, a stray missile, or an explosive gas cocktail released due to global warming, according to theories last week.

Russian scientists recently returned from the first expedition to look inside the giant hole which was previously spotted by helicopter.

Footage from inside the original crater showed that there is a lake at its base. The two new craters follow the discovery of a larger hole earlier this month around 230ft (70 metres) in diameter. Now the new holes - smaller in diameter but similar in shape - are posing a fresh challenge for Russian scientists

Their footage highlights a darkening around the rim which was earlier seen as evidence of heat possibly from an explosion during the crater's creation.

'They found the crater - around up to 300ft (70 metres) deep - has an icy lake at its bottom, and water is cascading down its eroding permafrost walls,' said The Siberian Times.

‘It is not as wide as aerial estimates which earlier suggested between 164ft and 328ft (50 and 100 metres).’

Andrey Plekhanov, senior researcher at the Russian Scientific Centre of Arctic Research, revealed that satellite mapping imagery is being used to establish when the phenomenon was formed, thought to be in the last year or two.

This giant crater measuring around 262ft and found in far northern 
Siberia is believed to have been caused by rising temperatures in the 
area - not a meteorite

Andrei Plekhanov, a senior researcher at the Scientific Research Center 
of the Arctic, who travelled to investigate the crater, said there were no traces of an 
explosion

The discovery eliminates the possibility that a meteorite had struck the
 region in the Yamal Peninsula - the name of which translates as 'the 
end of the world'

Mr Plekhanov said the enormous crater appears to be made up of 80 per cent ice which adds to the theory that it was caused by the effects of global warming

The darkening around the inner rim of the crater also indicates 'severe burning' which scorched the crater's edges, researchers said

One of the more popular theories is that the giant hole was caused by a phenomenon known as a pingo.

This is a subsurface accumulation of ice that has been covered by land.

When the ice melts it can leave behind a gaping hole that it once filled.

The other favoured theory is that the hole was caused by an explosion of methane underground.

The
 Yamal Peninsula is rich in natural gas, with its resources extensively 
tapped by Russia, and a mixture of water, salt and gas could result in 
an explosion.

The other theory is that it was caused by a meteorite, but most experts have ruled this possibility out as the phenomenon does not resemble normal impact craters.

'The crater has more of an oval than a circular shape, it makes it harder to calculate the exact diameter,' he said.

'As of now our estimates is about 98ft (30 metres). If we try to measure diameter together with soil emission, the so-called parapet, then the diameter is up to 197ft (60 metres).

The structure is so fragile that the scientists could not climb deep into the lake and had to send a camera down instead.

One theory is that the feature is a ‘pingo,’ reports the Sunday Morning Herald.

A pingo is a large chunk of ice that is located underground that can create a hole in the ground when it melts.

‘Certainly
 from the images I’ve seen it looks like a periglacial feature, perhaps a
 collapsed pingo,’ Dr Chris Fogwill of the University of New South Wales
 said.

‘This
 is obviously a very extreme version of that, and if there’s been any 
interaction with the gas in the area, that is a question that could only
 be answered by going there.’

Dr Plekhanov added the hole was most likely the result of a 'build-up of excessive pressure' underground, due to the region's changing temperatures.

He said 
80 per cent of the crater appeared to be made up of ice and that there 
were no traces of an explosion.

The discovery eliminates the possibility that a 
meteorite had struck the region.

'Could it be linked to the global warming? Well, we have to continue ourresearch to answer this question,' said Dr Plekhanov.

'Two previous summers - years 2012 and 2013 were relatively hot for Yamal, perhaps this has somehow influenced the formation of the crater.

Perma frost is seen near the hole in this photo. Some said the hole could have been formed by a meteorite striking the spot, but that no longer seems to be the case

Scientists working at the site measure some of the soil and debris around the crater

Until the expedition took place, shown, scientists had been baffled by the appearance of the giant hole

Thanks to their readings (shown) the team now believes the cause was increasing temperatures

It's not yet known if this event, which scorched the ground nearby (shown), could occur again in the area

Very remote: The crater has appeared in Yamal - a large peninsula jutting into Arctic waters, which is Russia's main production area for gas supplied to Europe 

The Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous Region is area known for its permafrost and pingos

The mysterious hole is in the Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous Region, some 20 miles from the Bovanenkovo gas field

The predominant theory so far is that the feature is a 'pingo'. This is a large chunk of ice that is located underground that can create a hole in the ground when it melts

'But we have to do our tests and research first and then say it more definitively.'

After the hole was discovered, there was speculation online about the crater indicating 'the arrival of a UFO craft'.

Ruling out extra-terrestrial intervention, Dr Plekhanov said: 'We can say for sure that under the influence of internal processes there was an ejection in the permafrost.

'I want to stress that was not an explosion, but an ejection, so there was no heat released as it happened.'

The latest expedition organised by the Yamal authorities included experts from Russia's Centre for the Study of the Arctic, and also the Cryosphere Institute of the Academy of Sciences.

They took samples of soil, air and water from the scene and were accompanied by a specialist from Russia's Emergencies Ministry.

Anna Kurchatova from the Sub-Arctic 
Scientific Research Centre, previously said the crater was formed by a mixture of
 water, salt and gas igniting an underground explosion, a result of 
global warming.

Gas accumulated in ice could have mixed with sand beneath the surface, and then mixed with salt.

Global 
warming may have caused an 'alarming' melt in the under-soil ice, 
released gas and causing an effect like the popping of a Champagne 
bottle cork, Ms Kurchatova suggests.

Yamal, a large peninsula jutting into Arctic waters, is Russia's main production area for gas supplied to Europe. 

Dr Plekhanov said: 'I've never seen anything like this, even though I have been to Yamal many times.'

The crater is different from others on Yamal. The experts say the phenomenon maybe a restarting of a process not seen for 8,000 years when the lake-pocked Yamal landscape was formed on what was once a sea.

This maybe 'repeating nowadays', he said. 'If this theory is confirmed, we can say that we have witnessed a unique natural process that formed the unusual landscape of Yamal peninsula.'
