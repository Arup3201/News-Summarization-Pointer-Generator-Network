Benfica are chasing Norwich striker Ricky van Wolfswinkel after the Carrow Road club were relegated to the Championship, according to Portuguese newspaper A Bola.

The Dutchman, who scored just once for Norwich - on his debut against Everton in the first game of the season - played for cross-city rivals Sporting Lisbon before joining the Premier League.

But Benfica boss Jorge Jesus is still interest in the flop despite his poor scoring record.

Van Wolfswinkel first moved to Portugal in 2011 after scoring 23 goals for Dutch side FC Utrecht in 44 appearances in the 2010-11 term.

He then scored 14 goals in consecutive seasons for Sporting, before his Â£9million move to Norwich.

The 25-year-old went 24 games without scoring last season, but could be playing in the Champions League next season with Portuguese Liga champions and Europa League finalists.
