Nico Rosberg has called on Formula One fans to 'forgive and forget' after being booed on the podium for the second successive race.

Following his collision on the second lap of the Belgian Grand Prix with Mercedes team-mate Lewis Hamilton, which led to the Briton later retiring, Rosberg was severely heckled as he collected his trophy for finishing second.

Rosberg suggested post-race it was 'the British people' who had turned against him, but the scenes following the Italian Grand Prix on Sunday confirmed it was not just Hamilton's countrymen now against him.

After again claiming the runner-up position, as a mistake on lap 29 allowed Hamilton to take the win, the Italians also voiced their displeasure at Rosberg's antics at Spa.

Being cast in the role of villain, when for so long he has been viewed as a nice guy, is clearly a concern for Rosberg.

'It's obviously not nice, but what can I say?' said Rosberg. 'I hope that with time they forgive and forget. That would be great.

'I have apologised, I can't really do anything more than that.'

Even Hamilton, booed himself in Italy in the past, has claimed he felt 'awkward...to hear them booing Nico.'

Mercedes motorsport boss Toto Wolff has also called on the fans to lay off his driver, who he feels is being affected by the situation.

'First of all, there shouldn't be any booing on the podium,' insisted Wolff.

'That's for the top three guys who have had a mega-race and, whoever it is, there shouldn't be booing. We're a sport, sport should unite.

'All those guys are fans, some of them are pretty emotional, and does it take a toll on you? Yeah, you have to be pretty tough.

'I don't even want to think about being booed. Maybe it's something you need to survive if you want to make it to the top.'
