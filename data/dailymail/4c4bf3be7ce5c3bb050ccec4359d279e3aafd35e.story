Colleague
 Mara Felices said: 'Martin grew up in La Bamba because his parents 
used to work for the previous owners, so he pretty much grew up riding 
horses.

'Horses were his toys, transportation to school, they were everything to him.

'Martin has always said that he doesn't believe he has a special gift - for him it is something natural.

'He
 only started to perform when the owners saw him a couple of times 
playing with different horses and encouraged him to show it to the 
people.
