Former first lady Hillary Clinton is now charging more  for public speaking engagements than her husband - and has an extensive list of  demands, it has emerged.

The 67-year-old reportedly charged a staggering $300,000 'special university rate' for a guest lecture at the University of California at Los Angeles on March 5, 2014.

This is compared to the $250,000 her spouse and former president, Bill Clinton, requested for his appearance at the same university in 2012, it is said.

As well as the high price, Mrs Clinton also reportedly insisted on the fulfillment of an array of demands, including a backstage menu featuring 'diet ginger ale, crudités, hummus and sliced fruit'.

The former Secretary of  State's requests were detailed in emails exchanged between her representatives and UCLA officials, later obtained by The Washington Post.

According to the emails, Mrs Clinton's representatives requested a case of still water - at room temperature - to be deposited on the stage prior to her March appearance.

They also insisted 'a carafe of warm/hot water, coffee cup and saucer... water glass, and lemon wed­ges' be situated on a table on stage, as well as 'two long, rectangular pillows' on her chair, it is said.

List of demands: She also apparently insisted on the fulfillment of an array of demands, including the request that the award she was to be presented with (pictured) should be in a box - not draped around her neck

And they reportedly wanted the same items to be placed in another room where Mrs Clinton would post for individual photos with 100 VIPS, or 50 couples. 

However, only two group photos were permitted - and they had to be pre-assembled, 'so the Secretary of State isn’t waiting for these folks to get their act together'.

'She doesn’t like to stand around waiting for people', a UCLA administrator said in an email, in which he relayed the concerns of the likely 2016 presidential candidate's representatives.

When the university asked whether Mrs Clinton offered a reduced rate for public universities, they were reportedly told $300,000 was the 'special university rate.'

Officials were surprised by the 'discounted price' following Mr Clinton's cheaper 2912 speech, with one administrator telling the newspaper: 'Wow! She gets $50K more than hubby!'.

It is unknown whether Mr Clinton made a list of demands for his inaugural Luskin lecture.

The correspondence, which took place over nearly a year, was obtained under a Freedom of Information Act request.

According to the emails, five days before the lecture, Clinton’s team rejected the podium planned for her use. Instead, the university had to get an new one.

Officials were also required to rent a new university seal to match and that the award she was to be presented with should be in a box - not draped around her neck, it is said.

And they reportedly had to buy a a computer, mouse and printer, as well as a scanner,for her visit.

Mrs Clinton's candidate fees have been well-documented.

Earlier this year, she defended the nearly quarter-million dollar fee she charges for speaking engagements at colleges and universities after students at one university demanded that she return the fee.

Mrs Clinton said that the enormous sums of money she has collected for speeches have gone towards her family's charity, The Clinton Foundation.

The politician's wealth has been under scrutiny since an interview earlier this year in which she described her family as 'dead broke' and in debt when Mr Clinton left the White House in 2001.

Mrs Clinton later called that description 'inartful.'

'All of the fees have been donated to the Clinton Foundation for it to continue its life-changing and life-saving work. So it goes from a foundation at a university to another foundation,' she told ABC. 

She added that her speaking engagements are used to present 'new ideas to help strengthen the economy, which in turn, will help lower income inequality.'

'It’s been my experience,' she said, 'That they’re not worried about my speaking or my household, they’re worried about their own.

'And that’s the kind of debate I think I’m furthering as I go around the country speaking.'
