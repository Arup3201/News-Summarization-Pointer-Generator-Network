Some of the UK's top sports pundits can't stop ripping off their shirts after whipping their abs into shape.

Sky Sports’ Alex Payne was one of six broadcasters to compete in Men’s Health magazine's annual Celebrity Six-Pack Challenge.

The most unlikely of men have been transformed into cover model stars thanks to the fitness initiative and the 31-year-old is no exception.

Sky Sports’ Alex Payne reveals the results of his six-week workout (Before and after shots)

He admitted that at first it was a 
struggle bulking up his 'lean frame' but he soon managed to schedule in 
daily workout sessions.

'I 
wouldn’t have done this if it weren’t for the element of competition. I 
genuinely thought I was going to die after the first gym session but I 
don’t think I really hated any of it.

'I got some very strange looks from the boys in 
the commentary teams when I started tucking into a protein shake at half
time,' he told Men's Health.

Alex said his colleagues, friends and family were shocked by his new appearance

Lifting weights, drinking protein 
shakes, running and abdominal crunches were some methods each of the male contestants,
all aged over 30, used to get in shape.

And each say that colleagues, friends and family have been shocked by their new toned physiques.

Goals on Sunday host Ben Shephard, 37, said: 'The banter from the
other guys has been pretty intense.

'The last time I had a six-pack was 30 years ago,' says Sky pundit Chris Kamara, 54

'I’ve always talked about getting a six-pack and now I’ve got one,' says Max Rushden, 32, host of Soccer AM

Radio 5 Live’s Mark Chapman, 38, said his goal was, 'to get back to feeling how I did when I was playing football five or six days a week. I wanted to look athletic, rather than muscle-bound'

'My wife went away for a few days and was shocked when 
she got back.'

Meanwhile the oldest contestant, former pro-footballer 
and exuberant Sky pundit Chris Kamara, 54, added: 'The last 
time I had a six-pack was 30 years ago and it’s been 20 since I lifted a
weight.

'So I thought I was too old and that I wouldn’t be able to keep 
up with the young lads.

However, Kammy’s transformation 
proved getting a six-pack isn’t just a young man’s game. 'To lose 6kg 
and gain muscle like I did in a few weeks shows it’s possible.'

Soccer AM’s Max Rushden, Radio 5 Live’s Mark Chapman and Football Focus and Match of the Day’s Danny Walker also took part.

Previous winners of the Men’s Health Celebrity Six-Pack challenge include Andi Peters and Reggie Yates.

Men’s Health Editor Toby Wiseman said: 'Six weeks might not seem long to get into great shape but each one of this year’s Men’s Health Celebrity Six-Pack challengers has achieved incredible physical results.'
