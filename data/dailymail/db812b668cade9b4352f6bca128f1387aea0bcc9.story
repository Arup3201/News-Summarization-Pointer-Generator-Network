Ronnie Baxter revealed he had to use an old set of darts at Alexandra Palace on Saturday but certainly will not be changing them after a 3-1 victory over Daryl Gurney in round one of the World Championship.

Baxter, twice a quarter-finalist, reckoned his arrows must have slipped out of his pocket while he was in a taxi on Thursday night. 

‘I couldn't believe it,’ said Baxter, the No 24 seed. ‘Luckily I had a spare set with me and used them. I’ve used my usual darts in the last two years and gone out in the first round.’

Baxter will now meet Scotland’s Robert Thornton, who dropped just two legs in a crushing 3-0 win over Andrew Gilding. 

No 17 seed Justin Pipe lost six legs in a row in his 3-2 loss to unheralded Australian Loz Ryder. Pipe was 2-1 up but failed to win another leg, leaving Ryder to proclaim: ‘Beating a player of Justin’s class give me the belief I can beat anybody.’

Belgium’s Ronny Huybrechts booked a second round meeting with last year’s finalist Peter Wright after crushing Andy ‘The Pie Man’ Smith 3-0.
