The Married at First Sight star who almost left her groom at the altar because she wasn't physically attracted to him was forced to smile throughout a cringe-worthy post-wedding photoshoot with her new husband - who was, ironically, thrilled to have married his new wife.

On last night's episode of the FYI reality show, 30-year-old Jaclyn Methuen, from Union, New Jersey, looked incredibly uncomfortable as she was forced to hold hands and cuddle up with her new groom Ryan Ranellone, 29, from Long Island, New York, as the pair posed for their first pictures as newlyweds.

'When I look back at those pictures I am going to see a girl [who] was very overwhelmed - disappointed. I wanted to get a guy that's tall, dark and handsome,' she revealed to the cameras. 

Cringe-worthy: Jaclyn Methuen grimaced as she posed for wedding photos with her new husband Ryan Ranellone on last night's episode of Married at First Sight

All for show: Jaclyn faked a smile for the camera as Ryan swept her off her feet after their nuptials

Forced together: The 30-year-old sales rep was visibly uncomfortable as the posed next to Ryan, letting out an awkward laugh after he told her that she was making him warm 

She continued: 'He is a little younger than I would have liked. He lives all the way on Long Island. How is that going to work? His accent is really going to really annoy me. At this present moment this is what I am feeling - definitely disappointment.'

To make matters worse, Ryan was oblivious to Jaclyn's feelings, despite the fact that they hugged instead of kissing after they said 'I do'.

When the sale rep commented that her new husband felt warm, he responded by noting that he is usually cold. 

'You are doing something to me already,' he told her.

Jaclyn responded to his playful comment by letting out an awkward laugh. 

Miserable bride: Ryan, who stated that he was very attracted to Jaclyn, leaned in for a kiss during the photoshoot 

Total strangers: Jaclyn told the cameras that she was going to look back at her wedding photos and see a girl who was 'very overwhelmed' 

'Jaclyn's a beautiful girl, and I feel instant chemistry,' he told the cameras. 'I just hope she feels the same.'

But his new wife was secretly overwhelmed by her whirlwind wedding to a complete strange.  

'This is a lot. This is just making me feel uncomfortable,' she said of the photoshoot. 'I am a very open person and I am very affectionate and touchy, but that's when I get to know somebody.'

She added:  'We are not essentially really a couple. Legally we are, but emotionally we're not. We're still strangers.' 

One of the show's relationship experts Dr Pepper Schwartz told the cameras that Jaclyn is 'putting on a good face for the wedding, but that is all she is doing'.

Grin and bear it: Jaclyn faked a smile as Ryan held her from behind

Missed connection: The couple stared at the floor as they posed together in a doorway

'Physical match is not the most important thing,' she continued. 

'What she really has to do is trust in the experiment and believe that the experts put her and Ryan together because they share essential values.'

Meanwhile, Jaclyn couldn't get over her reaction to her husband's physical appearance.   

'I was expecting to be a little more attracted,' she said. 'I don't look into his eyes and see my husband right now. This feels like a huge mistake.'

At their reception, Jaclyn's female friends reminded her that real-life is not a romantic comedy and that she shouldn't expect love at first sight. 

No contact: Ryan and Jaclyn can be seen dancing at their wedding reception 

Not romantic: Jaclyn looked away from Ryan throughout the dance 

Last week, Jaclyn spoke with Kathie Lee Gifford and Hoda Kotb on the Today show about her wedding day and revealed that she did indeed marry the groom whose physical appearance was giving her second thoughts. 

'I put so much pressure on my intuition,' she said of her disappointment in Ryan. 'I thought I was going to know that this guy is my soulmate and we were going to have that connection and those sparks.' 

On the season two premiere of Married at First Sight, Ryan happily agreed to marry Jaclyn, but the episode ended in a cliffhanger when she admitted she had doubts about her arranged marriage.

'I first see Ryan, my gut just says: "Oh man, like this is him?"' she told the cameras. 'The initial physical attraction really isn't there right now.’

She continued: 'When I saw him face-to-face, I felt a little disappointed. It just doesn't feel like this is the man who is my husband. I don't know if I can do this.'

Happy moment? Jaclyn smiled and pointed at her new husband during their wedding reception 

Good advice: Jaclyn's bridesmaids reminded her that real-life is not a romantic comedy and that she should have expected to fall in love with Ryan at first sight 

I do: After a moment of hesitation, Jaclyn agreed to marry Ryan, but they hugged instead of kissed after they exchanged vows 

And even though she said 'I do', Jaclyn is still struggling with her decision. 

Before coming on the show, the sales rep for Tito's Handmade Vodka had been single for the past seven years and admitted that she hadn't had sex in two years.

She confessed that she hoped her new husband would be 'personable, secure and confident'. Meanwhile, Ryan had been single for eight months. After a string of long-distance relationships, he explained that he finally felt ready to settle down.

Ryan and Jaclyn are just two of the six strangers who agreed to wed one another after finding themselves unlucky in love.

Over the course of several weeks, viewers will be able to watch as the couples go from wedding, to honeymoon, to 'early nesting', and then to the daily struggle of marriage.
