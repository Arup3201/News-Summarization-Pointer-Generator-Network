A policeman was paid more than £13,000 in compensation after injuring his big toe – during health and safety training.

The unidentified officer was one of 23 colleagues to lodge claims against Suffolk Police which has paid out more than £300,000 to staff since 2007.

It is just the latest in a string of cases which have heightened fears that there is a burgeoning compensation culture within the police.

Compensation culture: Officers from Suffolk police have claimed more than £300,000 in compensation from the force over the past six years reveal new figures

In March it was revealed that a woman officer is suing both her own force and a victim of crime over separate mishaps at work.

And last month, it emerged another 
officer is suing a burglary victim after allegedly falling into a drain 
while investigating a break-in.

In the latest case to come to light, 
the Suffolk Police officer pocketed £13,625 after he hurt his right big 
toe during a health and safety drill.

At least seven claims to the force 
were lodged by officers who were hurt during training. The figures 
released under Freedom of Information laws also reveal how another 
officer received a payout of £7,400 for slipping on a spillage in a 
custody suite.

Injuries: It emerged that PC Jones had also taken legal action against her force after she was involved in a collision while traveling in a patrol car

The biggest successful claim – for 
£130,845 – came in August 2010 when a member of force staff fell in a 
store room and fractured a hip.

Of the 23 compensation claims lodged 
with Suffolk Police, 16 were settled, five were dismissed and two – one 
involving an officer tripping over a pallet and the other when a falling
ceiling panel caused injury – remain outstanding.

Suffolk Police said the compensation payments may include ‘legal expenses’ and ‘third party solicitor’s costs’.

A spokesman said that of the £13,625 
paid out in the case of  the officer who injured his toe,  less than 
£4,000 amounted to  actual compensation.

The spokesman went on to defend the 
claims. She said: ‘The very nature of policing can mean that incidents 
attended by officers can involve pursuit or confrontation, which can 
potentially result in damage or accidents.

‘Every effort is made to reduce these 
instances but they can be inevitable in the course of ensuring that 
communities are kept safe.’

Matt Gould, chairman of Suffolk Police
Federation, denied that officers were becoming more litigious or 
greedy, adding: ‘I think one of the things that gets forgotten is that 
if police officers become injured to the extent where they can’t perform
all of the functions of the police officer they face compulsory 
termination of employment or medical retirement.

Alarmed: Home Secretary Theresa May called for a review into Police compensation claims saying that it was damaging public trust in officers

‘Just like any other employee, there needs to be some protection for them.’

But Jonathan Isaby, of the TaxPayers’ 
Alliance, said the case was ‘further evidence of how the compensation 
culture has got out of control in this country’.

He added: ‘Every penny spent on settling these claims means less money spent on frontline policing and keeping us safe.’

In March, WPC Kelly Jones triggered a 
furious backlash after it emerged she was suing a garage owner in 
Norfolk after tripping on a kerb while investigating a burglary.

It then emerged the 33-year-old is 
also demanding compensation from Norfolk Constabulary for a knee injury 
sustained in an accident in a police car.

The case prompted Home Secretary 
Theresa May to order a review of police compensation amid fears it may 
be deterring victims of crime from coming forward.

Then last month it emerged PC Richard 
Seymour is suing a burglary victim after he allegedly tore his Achilles 
tendon when he fell into a drain while investigating a break-in in 
Surrey in 2012.

He is suing for ‘loss of overtime’ during his six-month absence from work despite being on full pay.
