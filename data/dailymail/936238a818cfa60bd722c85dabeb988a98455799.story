The wife of a former Church of Scientology executive has blasted the ‘notorious, multi-billion dollar cult’ in a lawsuit claiming harassment by the group.

Marty Rathbun’s wife Monique has never been a Church member - but claimed in court papers filed in Comal County, Texas, that it has made ‘numerous, aggressive attempts to intimidate her’.

Mrs Rathbun was granted a temporary restraining order last Friday against the Church - and claims she has been ‘harassed, insulted, surveilled, photographed, videotaped, defamed, and humiliated’.

Complaint: The couple met in 2005 after Marty Rathbun - who led audits on Hollywood actor Tom Cruise (pictured) while at the organisation - had left the Church, and they started a new life in Texas

The couple met in 2005 after Mr Rathbun - who led audits on Hollywood actor Tom Cruise while at the organisation - had left the Church, and they started a new life in Texas, reported RadarOnline.

She alleges that the Church sent her a sex toy while she was at work, and when she was away it ‘sent flowers to one of my female co-workers with a “romantic” message purporting to be from me’. 

Mrs Rathbun also claims that the Church has published allegations that she is a ‘sexual pervert’ and a man who has had a secret sex change, according to the documents published by RadarOnline.

Her lawyer Ray Jeffrey said the lawsuit would have never happened if the Church had left her alone.

But it is claimed that high-tech cameras were installed in trees pointing at her driveway and a man moved onto a piece of land next to their home in a motorhome, claiming he was an author.

A Church of Scientology spokesman said it
had not been served with papers - but based on reports the complaint 
was ‘a pathetic get-rich scheme cooked up by unemployed blogger Marty 
Rathbun’.

He told RadarOnline that Mr Rathbun had ‘initiated a smear campaign against the Church and its ecclesiastical leader that is now in its fourth year’.

The spokesman added: ‘Much to Mr Rathbun’s continuing frustration, the Church since his departure is flourishing and undergoing a period of unprecedented expansion.’

The Church of Scientology numbers Tom Cruise and John Travolta among its devotees. The cult’s founder, science fiction writer L Ron Hubbard, claimed humans are extraterrestrial in origin.
