Mauricio Pochettino hailed the connection between his players and the club's fans as Spurs cruised into the semi-final of the Capital One Cup.

The north Londoners were convincing 4-0 winners over Newcastle and will now face League One club Sheffield United for a place at Wembley.

Pochettino's side have struggled at White Hart Lane on occasions this season, but the Argentine believes Wednesday night finally represented the coming together of his team and supporters.

Tottenham Hotspur manager Mauricio Pochettino hailed the connect between his players and the club's fans

The north Londoners were convincing 4-0 winners over Newcastle United at White Hart Lane on Wednesday

'It was a fantastic night. I'm very happy because that was first time the relationship between the team and the supporters was there at White Hart Lane,' he said.

'That was maybe our best performance under me. We know Tottenham have tradition in the cups and this victory was important for us. We needed this victory and performance for our supporters. Our players needed to feel that atmosphere.'

Of the favourable draw, he added: 'We need to have full respect for Sheffield United. We watched their game (1-0 win over Southampton) and they deserve to be in the semi-final.'

Spurs took a first-half lead when Nabil Bentaleb looped home after an error from rookie goalkeeper Jak Alnwick and Nacer Chadli doubled the advantage 35 seconds after half-time. 

Harry Kane then got his 13th of the season before Roberto Soldado capitalised on a spill from Alnwick to complete the rout.

And Pochettino praised the form of man-of-the-match Kane.

'He hasn't surprised me,' he said. 'We need to be careful with a young talent like Harry and build him step by step. But if deserves to play then we have no problems.'

Spurs climbed to seventh in the Premier League following Sunday's 2-1 victory at Swansea and now have winnable games against Burnley and Leicester over the Christmas period.

And Pochettino feels his influence is now evident on the pitch.

'You need to understand that the process needs time,' he said. 'The team is starting to show more character and looks more solid. We have shown we believe in our way.'

Newcastle, meanwhile, will now go to the Premier League in a bid to bring in a goalkeeper on emergency loan after Alnwick injured his shoulder in the second half.

He is currently deputising in the absence of the injured Tim Krul and Rob Elliot, and that pair are not expected to return until the middle of January at the earliest.

Alnwick is now a major doubt for Sunday's Tyne-Wear derby at St James' Park and manager Alan Pardew does not want to start 17-year-old Freddie Woodman against Sunderland.

'The rules do allow you to have an emergency loan if you have only one fit professional (goalkeeper),' said Pardew.

'We'll have to see how Jak's shoulder is, there is not a lot of time for recovery with Sunday in mind and there is no way a 17-year-old can go in goal in the Premier League.'

Pardew added: 'I feel for Jak. It's a cruel game and he's really in the firing line at the moment.'
