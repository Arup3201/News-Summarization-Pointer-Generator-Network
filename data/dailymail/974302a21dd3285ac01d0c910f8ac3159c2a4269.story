AC/DC drummer Phil Rudd made quite an exit from his latest court appearance in New Zealand, opting for a piggy back from his security guard as he was carried to his getaway car.

An arrest warrant had been issued to the 60-year-old after he failed to arrive on time in the High Court of Tauranga on charges of threatening to kill and drug possession.

He was due to appear at 9am on Wednesday.

Justice Timothy Brewer issued a warrant for his arrest, but said it could lie in court until 9.30am to give him time to arrive.

Rudd arrived shortly after the court was adjourned and the hearing was set to get under way 15 minutes late.

The New Zealand Herald reports Rudd entered no plea to the charges of threatening to kill another man and drug related offences including possession of cannabis and methamphetamine.

The musician's case was transferred to Tauranga District Court and the 60-year-old was remanded on bail.

He is due to face court again on December 2.

Rudd was previously charged with procuring a murder but those charges were dropped

On November 6, the rock legend appeared in court on charges of attempting to procure a man to murder two other men between September 25 and 26 and with threatening to kill another man on September 26. 

He was also charged with possession of amphetamines and cannabis following a police raid on his North Island home earlier that day.

But Tauranga Crown Solicitor Greg Hollister-Jones said after reviewing the file the next day that he had 'made the decision that there was insufficient evidence to proceed with the charge of attempting to procure murder'.

Consequently his charges relating to procuring a murder were dropped.
