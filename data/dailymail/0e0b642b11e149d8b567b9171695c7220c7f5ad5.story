She said she had quit competitive showjumping for the sake of her unborn baby.

But yesterday – to the surprise of a few early morning spectators and photographers – pregnant Zara Phillips was back in the saddle at a professional event.

Zara, 32, was playing the role of ‘guinea pig’ for the dressage at the Festival of British Eventing at Gatcombe Park.

Zara Phillips, showing a hint of her growing baby bump, was back in the saddle today shortly after her announcement that she was quitting competitive riding while pregnant

With her baby bump clearly showing, 
Zara did the test-run for the judges to help them decide how to mark the
 official riders at Gatcombe, the Gloucestershire home of her mother the
 Princess Royal.

Riding her horse High Kingdom, she looked happy and relaxed as she performed the dressage sequence.

Zara, a keen three-day eventer, 
originally said she would continue riding professionally for as long as 
possible – a decision that sparked worldwide debate.

But last month she changed her mind, saying she would quit all competitions.

The Queen's granddaughter was not competing in the Festival of British Eventing, however, but doing a 'guinea pig' trial to help judges decide how to mark riders

Zara and her husband Mike Tindall, 34,
 the former England rugby captain, announced they were having their 
first child last month and the baby is due early in the new year.

Despite giving up competitive riding, Zara has made it clear she still intends to ride privately as her horses need exercising.

Meanwhile, the Duke of Cambridge lifted the 
lid on his first days of fatherhood as he made his first public 
appearance since the birth of Prince George at a charity polo match 
admitting he would be picking up nappies on his way home.

William
 took a break from parenting duties to play in the Audi Polo Challenge 
at Coworth Park, Ascot, Berkshire alongside brother Harry today. 

The
 31-year-old, who scored the winning goal for his team, was presented 
with a mini polo stick for Prince George by Audi UK director Martin 
Sander after the match.

The Duke of Cambridge made his first public appearance since introducing his newborn son to the world at the Audi Polo Challenge today

William jokingly asked if it was nappies, quipping: 'I've got to pick some up on my way home.'

The royal admitted it was 'good to get out of the house' for an afternoon.

Meeting guests afterwards, he added: 'I've got to make sure I'm not too late back.'

Of
 his performance on the pitch, William admitted: 'I was in baby mode out
 there, thinking about nappies, I wasn't really in the zone.'

William was joined by his brother Harry for the annual charity event, held at the Coworth Polo Club in Ascot

Onlookers said that pregnant Zara looked 'very fit and well' as she performed a dressage trial in the parade ring at Gatcombe

A handful of spectators and photographers were at Princess Anne's country estate to see Zara perform the guinea pig trial ahead of today's events

Zara, wearing her usual competition riding gear, will not compete again until after her baby is born

And asked about son George, who was 
born on July 22, he said: 'He likes to move around a lot, he wriggles a 
lot, he keeps on our toes.'

The
 Audi Polo Challenge is held each year and this year was in aid of 
charities SkillForce and The Royal Marsden Cancer Charity, of which 
William is patron and president respectively.

Kate
 attended last year's match, along with the couple's puppy Lupo, to 
support William and Harry, but there was no sign of her today.

She is thought to be at her parents' home in Bucklebury, Berkshire, with Prince George.

Yesterday
 Kensington Palace announced that the birth of the third-in-line to the 
throne had been formally registered after a registrar from Westminster 
City Council visited the palace.

William,
 31, signed the birth register entry for his son, listing his and wife 
Kate's jobs as prince and princess of the United Kingdom.

William wore a polo jersey with the logos of SkillForce and the Royal Marsden Cancer Charity, of which he is patron and president respectively

Harry has joked that the birth of his nephew Prince George had taken the pressure of him to settle down

The RAF search and rescue pilot is currently on paternity leave but is expected to return to work at some point next week.

His next official public engagement will be to visit the Anglesey Show later this month.

An announcement on his future plans is expected within the next fee months.

William
 and Harry, 28, who yesterday joked about how his nephew's birth had 
taken the pressure off him to settle down, both played on the four-man 
Audi Quattro team as they took on the opposition Audi Ultra team.

The royals were watched by guests including former England rugby player Matt Dawson.

Harry and William are regular supporters of the annual event at the Coworth Polo Club in Ascot, Berkshire

Peter Cross, chief executive of 
SkillForce, an education charity which helps hard-to-reach children, who
 was in the crowd, said: 'This is fantastic. It is the third time that 
Audi have had SkillForce as one of the sponsored charities for the royal
 polo and we are really grateful for that.

'It's
 fantastic that the Duke of Cambridge's first public outing since the 
birth of his child is playing polo and SkillForce is a beneficiary of 
that.

'It's interesting that his last public engagement before his wedding was with SkillForce as well.

'It is a very close relationship, he is a wonderful royal patrol and he takes a very close interest.

Cally
 Palmer, chief executive of the Royal Marsden Hospital and Cancer 
Charity, said: 'The wonderful thing is the duke is a really hands-on 
presence at the hospital, he comes and visits, he takes a particular 
interest in the children that we treat at the Royal Marsden.

'The duke and duchess have been enormously generous with their support for us.'

'I am so happy that they have their son now and their support, from both of them, is amazing.'

She
 said the huge attention drawn by the William and Kate and their son 
meant the hospital would also be able to draw more attention to its work
 to find better ways to treat and diagnose patients.

Today's
 event was the 11th annual Audi Polo Challenge - its first included both
 William and Harry as well as their father the Prince of Wales.

Support: Wellwishers made a banner for Prince Charles visist which read 'Hi Grampa'

Meanwhile, The Prince of Wales received baby gifts from wellwishers during a visit to the world's smallest Highland games competition today.

Charles, known as the Duke of Rothesay when in Scotland, attended the Mey Games in Caithness in his role as chieftain of the event.

Charles drove to the event himself and emerged from his car wearing a Rothesay tartan kilt and carrying a traditional shepherd's crook.

A banner was draped from a nearby building featuring a stork carrying a bundle with a baby and crown, and the words: 'Hi grampa.'

He was given baby gifts and a card from wellwishers, and was seen to be in good spirits with locals despite some torrential downpours.

Charles judged the Highland games competition and officiated at a tug of war.

The games have been held annually for more than 40 years and are organised by the Royal British Legion.

Charles is continuing a tradition by visiting the games as his grandmother used to attend annually before her death in 2002.

The Queen Mother had close links with Caithness after buying the Castle of Mey in 1952 and became patron of the games soon after.

Organiser Stuart Webster said: 'It's the only Highland games apart from Braemar that enjoys royal patronage, and that's always an attraction for people.

'The Duke is the games chieftain and has attended all the events since the Queen Mother passed away. She was there every year and he stepped in after her death and has attended ever since. He certainly seems to enjoy it - he keeps coming back so it can't be that bad.'

Mr Webster has been involved in organising the event for more than a decade as part of the British Legion.

'I haven't been at a smaller games,' he said.

'I used to compete across the Highlands and I've been to a fair few games and this has the title of the smallest Highland games anywhere. I guess it makes it more friendly.'

He added: 'The weather doesn't matter - we've held it in lashing rain many times.'

Prince Philip, 92, will be back in public next Monday for the first time since going into hospital in June.

He will be in Scotland to present medals to Royal Society of Edinburgh fellows.
