Children were left in tears after yobs aged as young as 12 broke into their school 'farm', decapitated their pet ducks then ran off with their heads.

Police are now hunting the youngsters, whose act of cruelty shocked staff at Sandon Primary School, in Meir, near Stoke-on-Trent in Staffordshire.

The vandals, believed by officers to be aged around 12, hacked off the heads of ‘Dippy' and ‘Happy Feet' with a blunt instrument on Sunday night.

Headteacher Rachel Beckett was appalled.

She said: 'The staff and students are very shocked. The ducks were cared for by our youngest students. We have sensitively explained what happened to the ducks - luckily they didn't actually see them.

'But we are not going to let this incident put us off. The students get so much out of our farm. They clean out and feed the chickens and they sell the eggs. They love them.'

The farm at the school opened in September and the ducks had been kept in a coop in a secure compound, surrounded by high fencing, with six chickens and two goats.

The gruesome attack was discovered by shocked staff after they returned from half-term break on Monday.

The farm was locked over half-term with parents and staff pitching in to look after the animals.

Now goats ‘Delilah' and ‘Boomer' have been sent away while the staff make the site more secure, with additional fencing and CCTV.

Mrs Beckett added: 'The police think this must have been premeditated because the pen is so secure. I've written to parents explaining the situation.

'I'm appealing for anyone who knows anything to step forward. I'm sure this will shock people because we're a very tight community.

'I hope that if anyone does know anything they will speak up. In the meantime we will be securing the farm to make sure nothing like this happens again.'

Teaching assistant James Kiddle, who helped set up the farm, said: 'We wanted something for the children to give them learning opportunities outdoors.

'The children have formed an emotional attachment to their year group's pets. I can't believe that someone would want to do this. It's a totally horrific thing to do.'

Devastated year-six student David Foster, 10, who helped look after the animals during half-term, said: 'I've got chickens at home. We have all looked after the chickens, we feed and clean them out.'

Adam Dhorley, 10, added: 'It's disgusting that someone took the heads. I feel sorry for reception because they were looking after them.'

A Staffordshire Police spokesman said: 'Police were called at around 3.15pm on Saturday to attend the school following reports of two boys, aged around 12, in the school grounds chasing the ducks and chickens.

'We received a further call yesterday at 10.20am. Two ducks had been found dead. Local officers have been made aware.'
