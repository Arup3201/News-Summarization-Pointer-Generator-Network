‘We were playing in five-a-side match, and our team was losing because his man was always scoring,’ said Richards.

‘So I said to Mario: “You have to run”. He said something in Italian that wasn’t so nice and we had a bit of an argument, but after that it was finished. We are good friends in England.’

And Richards has backed Balotelli to make a success of his move to Liverpool.
