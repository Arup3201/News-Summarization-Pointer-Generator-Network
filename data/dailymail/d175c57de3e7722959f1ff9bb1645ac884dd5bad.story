Strange activity: Alexander Edwards, pictured, of Rustburg, was taking care of his friends Melissa Delp and Daniel Janney's children on December 22, 2013, when he decided to tattoo the pair

A Virginia tattoo enthusiast is facing child abuse charges after he allegedly inked two children he was babysitting without their or their parents' consent.

Alexander Edwards, 20, of Rustburg, was taking care of his family friend Melissa Delp's two daughters on December 22, 2013, while she and her boyfriend, Daniel Janney, were out.

According to ABC News, he used a home kit to tattoo the pair, who were both under the age of 13.

One of the girls reportedly had her name tattooed on her shoulder. It's not clear her sister got inked or what that tattoo was.

When Delp, 35, and her boyfriend, Janney, 32, returned home to find out what had happened, they attempted to remove the tattoos, Major L.T. Guthrie of the Campbell County Sheriff's Office said.

ABC reported that Janney tried to use a hot razor blade to remove the ink.

They too are now facing charges. 

'It didn't help the situation any,' Guthrie said of the parents' attempt to hide the inkings.

'It added more scarring.'

The couple is charged with two counts each of malicious wounding and child neglect.

Edwards is facing two counts of malicious wounding, two counts of abduction and two counts of felony child abuse.

Delp and Janney appeared at a preliminary hearing in Campbell County Juvenile and Domestic Relations Court on Monday.

Both children were younger than age 13 at the time, according to the Campbell County Sheriff's Office.

On his Facebook page, Janney, who has a neck tattoo, appears in countless photos with the little girls. He also posted a picture of himself and his 12-year-old son.

Edwards' fondness for tattoos is clear on his Facebook account, which is covered in photos of different designs and shows off his own markings on his arms.

The juveniles testified in a closed-circuit hearing, Campbell County Assistant Commonwealth's Attorney Cherie Washburn told the News Advance.

The hearing was not open to the public or media.

Janney appeared wearing jail-issued clothing. He is being held at the Blue Ridge Regional Jail without bond.

Delp has been released on bond and appeared in court in plain clothes.

Edwards, who remains in custody, will face court on May 12. The News Advance reported that a competency evaluation is pending for Edwards.
