She’s known for having modest tastes, but anyone cooking for her needs to help prepare some of the world's extravagant banquets.

The Royal Household has advertised for a new sous chef who can make meals fit for a Queen.

The £23,000-a-year chef will be based at Buckingham Palace but must be prepared to travel to other Royal residences and have a 'good understanding of kitchen French'.

Simple tastes: The Queen sits down for dinner at a banquet, but at home she enjoys more modest food

Fit for a Queen: The Royal Household has advertised for a new sous chef based at Buckingham Palace

The job description, posted on the Buckingham Palace website, says: 'From state banquets for 200 to lunches for two; and from canapé 
receptions for 800 to staff restaurant meals; our chefs prepare it all 
to the same exceptional standards.

'In this hands-on position you will help to lead and train the junior
chefs to deliver quality fresh food to the highest standards, and you 
will also take charge of the kitchen operation when working from smaller
kitchens and when deputising for senior colleagues. 

'Although primarily based at Buckingham Palace, you will also work as
part of a team at other Royal residences throughout the UK, spending a 
total of approximately three months away from London.'

Candidates are required to have experience of 'menu planning and development' and have 'proven planning and organisation skills'.

They also must have a City and Guilds catering 
qualification or equivalent and should have experience within a 
five-star premier catering operation.

However, according to former Royal chef Darren McGrady the day-to-day job of feeding the Queen could be far more modest.

Mr McGrady, who worked in the Buckingham Palace kitchens for 15 years,  told the Daily Telegraph last year that when at home the Queen was a woman of simple tastes.

Some of her favourite foods include Special K cereal, jam sandwiches and chocolate cake, he said.

The Royal Household employs 
around 1,200 staff, of whom approximately 450 are funded by the 
taxpayer.

The Royal Household is also advertising for an internal auditor, an administrator for the catering branch and two learning curators.

Applications for the sous chef post close on May 10.
