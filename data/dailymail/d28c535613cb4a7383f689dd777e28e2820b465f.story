Angry road safety and motoring groups have criticised England’s first controversial new £1million pub on the M40 motorway which opens today amid fears it could raise the risk of drink-driving .

The RAC said it was a ‘risky and frankly unnecessary move’ that was ‘at odds with common sense’  while road safety charity Brake said it represented ‘a potentially deadly temptation to drivers.’

Pub chain JD Wetherspoon said its Hope And Champion bar and restaurant will be open from 4am to 1am, seven days a week, in the Extra Motorway Service Area at junction 2 of the M40 in Beaconsfield, Buckinghamshire creating 120 jobs.

Opening: The launch by JD Wetherspoon at Beaconsfield services on the M40 in Buckinghamshire has prompted safety campaigners to issue a warning to motorists over the temptation of drink-driving

The pub, which is split over two floors, is licensed to serve alcohol from 9am. It  will sell real ale from local and regional brewers as well as hot drinks.

But the controversial plans have alarmed safety campaigners concerned about the  added risk of drink-driving  after the new establishment  had its 24-hours license approved in June 2013 by the South Bucks District Council.

Ed Morrow, campaigns officer for national road safety charity Brake said: ‘The opening of a pub on a motorway is a serious concern, presenting a potentially deadly temptation to drivers.

‘Drink driving remains one of the biggest killers on our road, causing devastation to families and communities every day.’

Mr Morrow added: ‘It is vitally important that messages about the dangers of drink driving are as strong and obvious as possible, so drivers know it's not okay to stop off for a quick drink on their way home. Our advice is not to have a drop if you are driving.’

Pete Williams, head of external affairs at the RAC whose own poll of motorists showed widespread opposition to the idea of pubs on motorways , said: ’The public appear to be very much against the introduction of motorway pubs.

'We appreciate the vast majority of motorists drive responsibly and that alcohol is already available in shops at motorway services, but for many this decision seems to be at odds with common sense.

'In our view this is a risky and frankly unnecessary move. The question we are struggling to answer is: of all the places to open a pub, why choose a motorway service station?’

Mr Williams added: ’The temptation to drink and drive can only be increased by easier access to alcohol. We therefore urge JD Wetherspoon to do all they can to convey the anti-drink-driving message as strongly as possible at this particular pub.’

But JD Wetherspoon's said they are keen to prove they are doing all they can to prevent drink driving.

They will include the national Drink Drive Awareness logos on menus and remove all alcoholic promotional deals.

Manager of the M40 branch, Steve Baldwin said: ‘Myself and my team are looking forward to welcoming customers into The Hope and Champion."

He said the pub ‘primarily serves the motorway users, but its facilities are also available to the surrounding community from the local road network.’

The RAC’s own research showed just one in eight (12 per cent) of people supported the decision to put pubs into motorway service stations.

Of the 2,000 people surveyed, more than six out of ten (64 per cent) opposed such a move. Older drivers being less accepting to the sale of alcohol at a motorway pub than their younger counterparts.

The research found that only one in 12 (8 per cent) of those aged over 55 were in favour of pubs being opened at motorway services while seven out of ten (71 per cent) were against.

In the younger 18 to 34 age range as many as one  in sex (18 per cent) supported the move and only just over half (52 per cent) disagreed. Nearly a quarter (24 per cent) of everyone questioned said they were undecided on the issue.

Doctors and motoring groups said a motorway pub sent out  the ‘wrong message’.

Professor Stephen Glaister, director of the RAC Foundation, said: 'Last year it was revealed that the number of drink-drive deaths had risen by a quarter to 290.

'Given this background does opening a pub at a motorway service station send the right message about road safety?

'People will probably be stopping off and using the loo and having a meal, but the temptation is there to have a drink. I’m very disappointed and I just cannot understand it'

Carol Whittingham, Campaign Against Drink Driving

'The majority of motorists are sensible but people would be forgiven for thinking the official line from ministers is now take a break and have a pint.’

Sir Ian Gilmore, Royal College of Physicians special adviser on alcohol and chair of the Alcohol Health Alliance, said he was ‘disappointed’ by  the decision to open a JD Wetherspoon on the M40: ’We are trying to prevent harm from alcohol-related traffic accidents and this sends out completely the wrong message.

‘The appearance of bars on our motorway network adds greater urgency to the Alcohol Health Alliance’s call for a fundamental review of licensing laws, focusing on the availability of alcohol and reducing alcohol-related harm.

'Public health should be a core licensing objective, and the impact on the health of local people must be a key consideration.'

An AA Populus survey found more than two thirds (68 per cent) of drivers were opposed to bars on motorway service areas serving alcohol. 

AA president Edmund King , AA said: ‘Two thirds of drivers are opposed to bars or shops serving alcohol on motorway service areas.

'Some fear that the fact that alcohol is served in areas mainly only accessible to drivers and their passengers may tempt some drivers to have ‘one for the road’.

Our advice is always that if you are going to drive, don’t drink, and if you are going to drink, don’t drive.

‘Perhaps pubs setting up close to motorways should offer free non-alcoholic drinks to drivers to show that they have a genuine concern for road safety.’
