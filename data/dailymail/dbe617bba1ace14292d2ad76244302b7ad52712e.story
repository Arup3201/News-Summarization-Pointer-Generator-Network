The controversial plans to expand Heathrow Airport have been heavily criticised by some members of the public.

But others are cool with the idea, and have given it the thumbs up.

So when the BBC asked The Fonz  asked for his views on the expansion, it was no surprise to hear he was relaxed about the proposed upgrade.

Henry Winkler, who played Arthur 'Fonzie' Fonzarelli  in the 1970s sitcom Happy Days, was stopped in Richmond, Surrey, and interviewed by Deputy Politics Editor James Landale about the plans to build an additional runway at the London hub.

Aaaaeeeyyy: Henry Winkler, who played The Fonz in Happy Days, was stopped in Richmond, Surrey

The 68-year-old, who is currently 
playing Captain Hook in a pantomime, was asked whether he was a voter or a permanent resident before the reporter realised who he was.

He was told the 
upgrade would bring more noise disruption to the town, which lies 
underneath the flight path.

But the actor still gave the plans his approval, saying he watches the planes fly overheard and they do not bother him.

Mr Winkler asked the reporter whether the extension would 'bring more people to the economy', and then said: 'Richmond is lovely. I watch the planes go by every day. I hear nothing.'

The journalist then asked him if he was relaxed the planes, to which Mr Winkler said: 'Yes'.

Mr Winkler, who played the leather-jacketed bad boy for 10 years, is only living in the country temporarily while he performs in Peter Pan at the Richmond Theatre.

Mr Landale, who joined the BBC in 2003, was questioning people in the town centre for the Six O'Clock News.

Quizzed: He was interviwed by BBC's Deputy Political Editor James Landale, who asked whether he was a voter

In a blog post describing the encounter, he said he noticed a middle-aged man wearing a scarf and thought he was a 'promising interviewee'.

But then he said he became a 'gabbling starstruck idiot' when he realised he was speaking to the iconic actor.

'For the record, it was not a set-up, it was a totally random meeting; I did know he was Henry Winkler but it took a moment to sink in; and yes, as a resident of Richmond - albeit a temporary one - he has just as much a right to an opinion as anyone.' he said.

'The only regret was my last question. I asked if he was relaxed about the plans.

'When of course I should have asked if he was cool about them. Perhaps while giving an interrogatory thumbs up.'

Relaxed: The actor said he did not mind the proposals before he walked away

Thumbs up: He played the the leather-jacketed bad boy in the sitcom for 10 years

Fonzie: He was renowned for being a womaniser and had several catchphrases, including 'Exactamundo'
