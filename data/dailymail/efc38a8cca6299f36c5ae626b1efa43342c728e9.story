More than a tonne of cocaine worth £60million has been seized from a speedboat in the Caribbean in an operation involving the Royal Navy, the Ministry of Defence said today.

The 1.25 tonnes of the Class A drug seized last week had a UK wholesale value of more than £60million, but the street value would have topped £300million.

The crew of Royal Fleet Auxiliary Naval Support Ship RFA Wave Knight, along with a US Coast Guard patrol aircraft, forced a speedboat suspected of drug smuggling to stop in international waters south of the Dominican Republic during the night of January 22.

Seized: Wave Knight then launched its own small boat with a US Coast Guard team to board and question the suspects

The US Coast Guard helicopter fired warning shots in an attempt to get the boat to stop but when the suspected smugglers were observed throwing the bales of drugs overboard the decision was made to use disabling fire, the MoD said.

Wave Knight then launched its own small boat with a US Coast Guard team to board and question the suspects.

A second boat from Wave Knight, which frequently docks at Devonport in Plymouth, recovered 45 bales of cocaine which had been thrown overboard into the water nearby.

Defence Secretary Philip Hammond said: 'Once again the Royal Navy have played a key role in the international mission to tackle the drugs trade from the Caribbean.

'The crew of RFA Wave Knight should be proud of their role in seizing such a massive amount of drugs, made more impressive as it is their second successful operation within a month.'
