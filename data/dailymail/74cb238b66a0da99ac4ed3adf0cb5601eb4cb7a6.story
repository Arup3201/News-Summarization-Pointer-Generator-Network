Giving children blighted by a cough placebo medicine can prove the most effective treatment, a new study has found.

Scientists at the Penn State College of Medicine say opting for a dummy cough syrup could be the best way to treat a child's cough.

It defies the commonly-held belief among doctors that common coughs improve on their own, without any specific treatment.

The team of researchers compared the effects of an agave nectar - a natural sweet syrup from the agave plant - on night-time coughs, with that of a placebo syrup and no treatment at all.

Their findings revealed both the nectar and the dummy treatment produced marked improvements in the participant's conditions.

The team said they believe this may be the result of parents feeling more confident of their child's condition having given them a treatment they believed would help. 

A group of 119 children took part in the study, carried out by Dr Ian Paul of the Penn State College of Medicine.

Researchers analysed the effects of the agave nectar, the placebo treatment and no treatment at all, on participants' coughs and sleep disturbance as a result. 

The placebo used in the study was a grape flavoured water coloured with caramel.

That and the agave nectar were given to the children via syringe by their parents before they went to bed.

Children aged two to 47 months took part in the one-night study. They only qualified for the trial if they had experienced a cough for seven days or less.

Dr Paul wrote in the Journal of the American Medical Association, Neurology: 'While it is somewhat disappointing that agave nectar does not appear to offer added benefit over a placebo, these findings suggest that the common clinical advice of watchful waiting with no treatment may not be the best advice for parents whose infants and toddlers are struggling with cough and its associated sleep disruption.

'Both physicians and parents want symptomatic relief for children with these common and annoying illnesses. 

'The significant placebo effect found warrants consideration as health care providers and parents determine how best to manage the disruptive symptoms that occur in the setting of upper respiratory tract infections among young children. 

'Placebo could offer some perceived benefit, although at a financial cost, while reducing inappropriate antibiotic prescribing.'

The researchers had hoped to show agave nectar would be a suitable alternative to honey for young children.

Honey cannot be given to babies under a year old because it carries a small risk of botulism.   

Cough medicines are waste of money, doctors declared today.

Both NHS bosses and leading GPs have dismissed the products - and say traditional home made remedies with lemon or honey to be the best approach.

Cough medicines, which usually cost between £3 and £5 for a small bottle, are part of an over-the-counter healthcare industry worth £3 billion a year. 

But the NHS Choices website advises: 'There's little evidence to suggest cough medicines actually work, although some ingredients may help treat symptoms associated with a cough, such as a blocked nose or fever.'

Cough medicines are a 'waste of money' and you're better off using honey and lemon, doctors have claimed

The webpage adds that the 'simplest and cheapest' treatment for a 'short-term cough' may be a homemade remedy containing lemon and honey.

It continues: 'There's no quick way of getting rid of a cough caused by a viral infection. It will usually clear up after your immune system has fought off the virus.'

Dr Tim Ballard, vice chair of the Royal College of General Practitioners, today backed up the NHS claim.  

He said: 'The medical evidence behind cough medicines is weak and there is no evidence to say that they will reduce the duration of illnesses - as such, GPs are unlikely to prescribe them.'

A Which? investigation two years ago said found many popular cough medicines do not work as well as they claim to.

The report authors concluded that studies used to support the claims of effectiveness are often low quality.

Many also contain high doses of sugar, with one week of the adult maximum dose of a popular product containing as much sugar as five Mars bars.

A bottle of Dry Coughs remedy by leading brand Benylin is sold in Boots for £4.99 for a 150ml bottle.

Benylin's website states: 'Through its active ingredients, Benylin Dry Coughs Original helps to suppress the coughing mechanism, reducing the urge to cough.'
