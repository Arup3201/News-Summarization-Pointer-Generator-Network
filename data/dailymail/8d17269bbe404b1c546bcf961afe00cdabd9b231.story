Roy Hodgson's England squad raised a staggering £380,550 for charity at their World Cup send-off ball on Sunday night.

The England Footballers Foundation, which is chaired by the country's captain Steven Gerrard, hosted the event at the Grove Hotel in Hertfordshire.

With the exception of Wayne Rooney, who travelled to Portugal last week to begin his training regime, every England player was in attendance.

Leader: Steven Gerrard is joined by Rickie Lambert, Jon Flanagan, Chris Smalling and Phil Jones at the charity gala

Strength in numbers: Frank Lampard, Ross Barkley, Glen Johnson, Ben Foster, James Milner, Luke Shaw, Gary Cahill and Leighton Baines on the red carpet at last night's gala

Suit you, sir: Adam Lallana, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, Jack Wilshere and Raheem Sterling hit the red carpet

Entertainment: Platinum selling duo Rizzle Kicks performed for the England squad

All smiles: Arsenal midfielder Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain enjoys himself during the charity dinner

The evening, which included a dinner for guests put on by chef Marco Pierre White, raised a huge sum for charity.

England's players will donate their World Cup match fees to the Foundation, which are then passed on to various causes which are decided upon by the players' committee.

The Bobby Moore Fund is one of four charities which will benefit from the £362,000. The charity was set up in memory of England’s only World Cup winning captain who died from bowel cancer, aged 51.

Send-off: Brit award winners the Kaiser Chiefs were also on hand to sing for England

Moore led England to their 4-2 triumph over West Germany at Wembley in 1966 and the charity, established by his wife Stephanie in 1993, works with Cancer UK to raise awareness about the disease.

Children's charity Rays of Sunshine, The British Forces Foundation and the EFF Academy - which helps disadvantaged youngsters across the country - will also benefit.

Hodgson's squad trained together on Monday morning before flying out to their Vale do Lobo training base to begin their World Cup preparations. England's first World Cup warm up match is against Peru, at Wembley, next Friday.

The England Football Team hosted Lions and Roses, a special gala dinner to benefit the England Footballers Foundation and the charity partners it supports; Rays of Sunshine, the British Forces Foundation, the Bobby Moore Fund for Cancer Research UK and the EFF Academy.
