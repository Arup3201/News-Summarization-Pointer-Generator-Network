Lord Thomas, the Lord Chief Justice, said he was ‘in no doubt’ access to pornography online encouraged perverts to turn their fantasies into reality

Extreme online pornography is fuelling rape and murder, the country’s most senior judge warned yesterday.

Lord Thomas said vile internet material undoubtedly encouraged sex fiends to turn their fantasies into reality.

His hard-hitting comments, given in evidence to MPs yesterday, add huge weight to the Mail’s Block Online Porn campaign.

The Lord Chief Justice specifically referred to the appalling murder of Georgia Williams.

Jamie Reynolds, who was obsessed with violent online images, had convinced the 17-year-old to pose for him with a rope around her neck for a ‘fantasy photoshoot’.

But he kicked away the box she was standing on, left her hanging and took pictures of her naked after she died. The 23-year-old pervert had been watching extreme pornography immediately before Georgia arrived at his home.

Lord Thomas, who threw out Reynolds’ appeal against his whole life term last year, said the case ‘left me in no doubt at all that the peddling of pornography on the internet had a dramatic effect on the individual’.

He added: ‘What is available to download and to see is simply horrific and it played a real part in the way in which this particular murder was carried out.’ 

He told the Commons justice committee the crime in May 2013 had been influenced – and intensified – by pornography.

It was hard to believe, he said, that Reynolds could have come up with his sickening plan without first reading about similar fantasies or offences online.

Michael Ellis, a barrister and Tory MP, said the Lord Chief Justice’s evidence was significant because judges knew better than almost anyone about the driving forces behind offences.

He added: ‘If the impression he has been left with, having dealt with some of the most serious cases, that extreme pornography is influencing some crimes, then I think that is very persuasive.’

In October 2012, Mark Bridger was jailed for a whole-life term after being found guilty of killing five-year-old April Jones a year earlier. He had searched for images of child abuse and rape.

And in May 2013, Stuart Hazell was jailed for murdering 12-year-old Tia Sharp after scouring the internet for vile child porn using terms such as ‘violent forced rape’ and ‘incest’.

More protection: In a crackdown on digital perverts, the Government created a specific offence of communicating sexually with someone under the age of 16 – closing a gaping legal loophole

Campaigners have repeatedly called for internet service providers to block violent and child pornography.

And, after the long-running Mail campaign to block internet porn, the Government gave families the choice of whether to opt in or block online pornography from home networks.

Ministers have also forced internet giants to block searches for around 100,000 terms relating to child abuse.

Last week internet providers Sky and TalkTalk become the latest firms to place an automatic block on pornographic websites. Campaigners are putting pressure on BT and Virgin Media to follow suit.

In the Reynolds case, Stafford Crown Court was told he had written a horrific story entitled Georgia Williams In Surprise in which he outlined how he was going to kill her. 

Prosecutors said the ‘sexual deviant’ from Wellington, Shropshire, had a ‘morbid fascination in pornography depicting violence towards young women’.

Lord Thomas, who became head of the judiciary of England and Wales in late 2013, also raised the prospect of high-profile extradition cases being broadcast live on television.

A pilot scheme has seen some Supreme Court and Court of Appeal hearings shown to viewers for the first time, he told MPs. But Lord Thomas said televising criminal sentencing or appeals could inadvertently force victims to re-live harrowing evidence or show details that could encourage other crimes.
