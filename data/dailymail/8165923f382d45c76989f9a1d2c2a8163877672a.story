The Manchester City supporter involved in a confrontation with Neymar after Barcelona's 2-1 Champions League victory at the Etihad Stadium on Tuesday believes the Brazil captain's behaviour was 'unprofessional.'

Aziz Hammad clashed with Neymar after appearing to make diving taunts to the attacker.

'It's part of football, it wasn't abuse,' Hammad said to BlueMoonRisingTV. 'It's very unprofessional to come face to face with a fan and look like he was picking a fight.'

Season ticket holder Hammad added that Neymar's comments in Brazilian media about the row, where he said 'my mother gave me an education. What his mother did not tell him, my mother taught me' were not directed at him, because he does not speak Portuguese.

'To clarify, I did have an altercation with Neymar but his quotes in the media weren't directed at me,' Hammad said. 'I didn't understand him as I don't speak Portuguese and he doesn't understand English - I wasn't the one who his quotes were directed at.'

Hammad alleges that Neymar could have been referring to a Portuguese supporter who he may have exchanged words with.

'I don't speak Portuguese,' Hammad said. 'I sit lower tier, the Portuguese fan was upper tier.'

The same fan had earlier taunted Neymar and the Barcelona  bench after Lionel Messi's missed penalty

Hammad said the clash started shortly after Lionel Messi missed a penalty for Barcelona in the final moments of the game.

'My first interaction with Neymar was when Messi missed the penalty - I made a diving gesture to the bench, just the same as everyone else,' Hammad said. 'Neymar pointed and singled me out, he gestured for me to go towards him. I told him to come to me, the next thing final whistle blew.

'Neymar walked around towards me and came face to face. He said things in Portuguese but I don't speak Portuguese. Stewards told me I was in trouble and Neymar walked off. That was the end until the video was sent to me.

'I was just doing what everyone else was and I couldn't believe the reaction. Most players just ignore fan gestures and taunts.'

Hammad admitted that taunting players is not acceptable behaviour but believes players must be able to ignore it, due to the number of fans that do it.

Luis Suarez scored both goals for Barcelona in their first leg win as the former Liverpool striker marked his return to England.

Neymar missed a good chance to add a third in the first half while Dani Alves also hit the bar as the Spanish giants dominated the Premier League champions.
