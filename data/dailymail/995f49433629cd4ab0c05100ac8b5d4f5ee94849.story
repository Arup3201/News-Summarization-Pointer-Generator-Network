Fined: Natasha and Stewart Sutherland pictured arriving at Telford Magistrates Court. They were fined £630 and ordered to pay £300 after they went on holiday with their children during term time

A couple were hit with a £1,000 penalty yesterday for taking their three children out of school for a foreign holiday.

Stewart and Natasha Sutherland fell foul of a new law allowing councils to fine parents who fail to ensure their children attend class.

They returned home from the week-long break to Rhodes – their first family holiday in five years – to find they had been fined £360. This was soon doubled to £720 because they did not pay up quickly enough.

The case went to a magistrates court yesterday where the Sutherlands were forced to enter a guilty plea. Their fine was amended to £630 with £300 costs and a £63 victim surcharge.

Speaking after the case, Mr Sutherland, who works for the Ministry of Defence Guard Service, said the week in question was the only one he and his wife could both take off work.

‘We had no choice but to plead guilty otherwise me and my wife could have been behind bars,’ added the 39-year-old.

‘Surely that would make our children’s education suffer more than a much-needed holiday? I can’t see the justice in it at all.

‘I work in a sensitive job where staffing levels have to be maintained. There’s been a recruitment and overtime ban and it’s been impossible to arrange summer leave that fits in with the rest of the family.

‘I know how important education is – but there’s a bigger picture. Family time is important, too, and the children’s behaviour and schooling has improved massively since our holiday.’

Justices in Telford, Shropshire, 
rejected the family’s argument that the holiday was booked before the 
new school attendance law came into place.

Claims: Following the ruling, Mr Sutherland said outside court today that 'people who make these laws do not live in the real world'

The
 couple – with Rhiannon, 15, Sian, 13, and Keane, six – went abroad on 
September 25, just 25 days after the law came into force. It ended a 
policy that allowed schools to grant up to ten days off for family 
holidays.

Now parents are required to send their children to school except in exceptional circumstances.

Offenders
 risk a £2,500 fine or three months in jail. The Sutherlands had been 
refused permission by the school but decided to take the holiday anyway.

The local authority issues a penalty notice to parents who fail to ensure their kids attend school.

It equates to £60 per child, rising to £120 if it's not paid within 21 days.

After 28 days, if the fine remains unpaid, the local authority is required to begin legal proceedings in a magistrate's court.

The couple are being prosecuted under Section 444 of the 1996 Education Act, subsections one and eight.The two parts refer to a parent's failure to secure regular attendance at school of registered pupil.

If a child of compulsory school age fails to attend the school regularly, his parent is guilty of an offence.

If
 the parent knows that his child is failing to attend regularly at the 
school and fails without reasonable justification to cause him to do so,
 he is guilty of an offence.

If
 a person is guilty to any of the above offences they are liable on 
summary conviction with punishments ranging from a fine to a three-month
 prison sentence. 

The guidelines apply to all state-funded schools.

Mr Sutherland, who 
defended himself and wife Natasha, 36, in court, added: ‘I stand by my 
decision.

'Most parents can take their holiday when kids are off.

'Unfortunately I can’t. There’s no flexibility at all. If the whole 
country took their holiday when the kids were off school the country 
would come to a standstill.

'It’s like we are being taxed because I’m a 
shift worker.

‘I’m being treated like a criminal because I am trying to do the best for my family.’

The
 Sutherlands, from Telford, claim they have not lost out because the 
money they saved with an out-of-season holiday was greater than the 
penalty.

Prosecuting for 
Telford & Wrekin Council, Carol Trigger told the court the family 
were warned they did not have permission to go on holiday.

She said: ‘There was a change in legislation that had been communicated to parents in July via the school newsletter.

‘Mr
 and Mrs Sutherland had the opportunity to pay the lesser fines 
totalling £360 within 21 days but they chose not to pay.

The penalty 
notice clearly states the non-payment of fines will result in 
prosecution.’

A Department
 for Education spokesman said: ‘Poor attendance at school can have a 
hugely damaging effect, and children who attend regularly are nearly 
four times more likely to achieve five or more good GCSEs than those who
 are regularly absent.

Older children: Their daughters Sian, 13, and Rhiannan, 15, both attend Sutherland Business and Enterprise College in Telford

‘That is why we have given schools more power to tackle poor attendance and allowed them to intervene much earlier.

‘We have increased the amount parents can be fined for unauthorised absences and cut the amount of time they have to pay.

‘Parents
 should never simply discount a possible penalty notice from the cost of
 a cheaper holiday, because this is a criminal offence.’
