Rory McIlroy dominated golf in 2014 but that doesn't mean the Northern Irishman was the only man to play some sparkling shots over the year.

From Bubba Watson to Phil Mickelson via Martin Kaymer, there was plenty to send golf fans swooning. Even Tiger Woods - dodgy back and all - struck a few crackers (not very many though).

The PGA Tour have selected their top 10 shots  in 2014, but which do you consider the best? These are the contenders and you can watch each shot in the video below...

8 - Rory McIlroy's 245-yard five wood over water to a protected pin in the final round of the Honda Classic at PGA National in Florida. His ball finished eight feet from the flag.
