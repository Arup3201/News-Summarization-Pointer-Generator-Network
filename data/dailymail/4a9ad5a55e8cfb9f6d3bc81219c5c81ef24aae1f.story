When a pensioner arrived at school to take his six-year-old granddaughter to the GP, teachers fetched a girl from class and off they went.

Only it wasn’t his granddaughter – and because the 74-year-old has very poor sight, he did not notice.

The man, who has not been named,  then took her on a mile-long bus journey to the GP, where she was prescribed Calpol, and dropped her off back at school.

Mistake: The Napier Primary School in Gillingham, Kent, sent the wrong six-year-old to the GP with a pensioner who had come to collect his granddaughter

It was not until the youngster went home and showed the medicine to her puzzled parents that the mistake was discovered.

Yesterday Napier Primary School in Gillingham, Kent, launched an investigation into how such a blunder could have happened.

The mistake took place on Tuesday after the girl’s parents telephoned the school to say her grandfather would arrive to take her to the doctors’ because she was ill.

But the girl handed over to him was not his granddaughter – although she is in the same class, shares the same first name, has similar blonde hair and is around the same height. And when she was asked if it was her grandfather, she nodded.

GP:
The grandfather took the girl to the Gillingham Medical Centre, Kent, 
(pictured) where the doctor didn't realise he had seen the wrong girl. 
The girl's father realised it was down to several 'honest mistakes'

Last night the girl’s father, a  36-year-old systems tester for an IT company, said he thought his ‘shy’ daughter may have thought the man was her dead grandfather.

‘A little bit of pressure was put on her and she felt like it was the right thing to do to agree it was her grandfather,’ he said.

‘We have pictures of him up in our home so I think she got confused.’

The father, who asked not to be named, realised something was wrong when his daughter said at home, ‘here is my medicine’.

On the bottle were the name and details of a different girl in her class.

He added: ‘My daughter’s been known to tell a tale or two so I took her to the surgery and the doctor said, “I saw her this morning with her grandfather”.

‘It could have been worse. The doctor could have given her an insulin injection if that was what the appointment was for.’

He said he now realises the confusion arose after ‘several honest mistakes’. ‘It is very strange that a grandfather would not know his granddaughter, but I understand he has poor sight,’ he said. ‘Thank God it was an innocent thing done by a confused old gentleman.’

He added: ‘The first thing I thought was the worst. I had to ask my daughter the sort of questions no parent ever wants to ask, “did he do this, did he do that”. When your daughter has been walked round town and taken on a bus by a strange man it makes you sick to the stomach.’

The girl’s parents believe the receptionist wrote down her first and second name rather than the correct surname.

Both girls are six, in the same class, are the same height and have blonde hair.

The
mistaken girl lives with her father, NHS manager mother, 37, and 
younger brother in Gillingham, Kent, has not suffered an ill-effects 
from the incident.

But her father said: 'I went ballistic. I was boiling inside. The first thing I thought was the worst.

'I
had to ask my daughter the sort of questions no parent ever wants to 
ask, ‘did he do this, did he do that. When your daughter has been walked
round town and taken on a bus by a strange man it makes you sick to the 
stomach. It’s every parent’s worst nightmare.

'Everyone
knows to tell their children not to go with strangers but I want to 
tell every parent in that school - tell them again tonight.'

He
added: 'My daughter’s been known to tell a tale or two so I took her to
the surgery and the doctor said ‘I saw her this morning with her 
grandfather’.

'It could have been worse. The doctor could have given her an insulin injection if that was what the appointment was for.

'The practice manager of the surgery said she’s been there for 25 years and she’s never seen anything like it.'

The school is now reviewing its safeguarding policies.

Headteacher
Zerina Slade, who called staff into a crisis meeting after the 
incident, said the safety of pupils is 'of the utmost importance'.

Mrs
Slade said: 'The safety and care of all of our children is of the 
utmost importance to us and we are treating this matter extremely 
seriously. As soon as we realised this had occurred, we launched an 
investigation.

'This has 
not only involved speaking to staff to find out how this could have 
happened, it has also involved reviewing all our procedures in 
connection with children’s safety.

'I
have also spoken with the mother of this child to offer our sincere 
apologies over this regrettable incident and to assure her that we are 
reviewing all our safeguarding policies - with the help of the council -
to ensure this never happens again.'

The practice manager at Gillingham Medical Centre, where the girl was taken, have refused to comment.

The incident has been referred to social services by police.
