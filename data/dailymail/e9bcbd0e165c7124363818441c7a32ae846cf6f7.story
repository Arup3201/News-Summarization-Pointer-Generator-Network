As many as twelve Australians are on death row overseas facing possible execution, not including Bali Nine leaders Myuran Sukumaran and Andrew Chan.

According to Fairfax, the dozen Australians, including two grandmothers, have all committed serious crimes abroad which carry the death penalty and they could be next to face the executioner.

The unlucky twelve are in addition to the Bali Nine duo and Pham Trung Dung, who is on death row in Vietnam for trafficking heroin.

According to Fairfax, a 71-year-old grandmother is among the twelve inmates possibly facing execution overseas. It is understood that the majority of the cases are related to drug trafficking offences.

In a report released to Fairfax, the Department of Foreign Affairs is noted as being heavily involved with many of the cases. However, speaking to the publication, the Department of Foreign Affairs said it did not play a part in any of the twelve cases.

'These figures are subject to revision and represent the best of our knowledge. As a matter of policy we do not disclose the names or locations of these consular clients,' a spokesman for DFAT said.

While the DFAT declined to comment on individual cases, the report stated that it had helped with the investigations of 239 'potential death' cases in the past three years. 

Myuran Sukumaran and Andrew Chan, were arrested in 2005 when they attempted to smuggle 8.3kg of heroin from Bali to Australia

Myuran Sukumaran and Andrew Chan, were arrested in 2005 when they attempted to smuggle 8.3kg of heroin from Bali to Australia.

Despite their attempts to rehabilitate themselves behind bars, they are both now facing death by firing squad in Indonesia. 

They have appealed for clemency from the Indonesian government with an Australian campaign founded by friend and artist Ben Quilty supporting them from their home country. 

Death row inmate Pham Trung Dung, an Australian of Vietnamese origin, was arrested in May 2013 when custom officials reportedly found four kilograms of heroin in his luggage as he was boarding a flight from Ho Chi Minh City to Australia.

A court heard in June 2014 that Dung had been living in Australia with his partner, To Quyen, since 2000 and travelled to Vietnam with her and his two sons in 2013 to visit family.

It was in Vietnam that Dung reportedly agreed to transport two bags  of heroin given to him by an acquaintance to take to another acquaintance in Australia.

According to online paper VnExpress, Dung said he knew it was illegal but could not pass up the $40,000 payout.

Up until now, the public were only aware of two other Australians who were possibly facing execution - Sydney man Peter Gardner and Australian mother of four Maria Elvira Pinto Exposto. 

Gardner made headlines last year when he was arrested for allegedly attempting to traffic 30 kilograms of methamphetamine, also known as the drug ice out of China.

The 25-year-old was taken into custody along with Kalynda Davies, also from Sydney, who has since returned to Australia.

Guangzhou Customs claim they found the drugs in 60 vacuum-sealed bags inside Gardner's luggage while he was on his way to Sydney on Flight CZ325, the Sydney Morning Herald reported.

His two pieces of hand luggage had to be forced open by authorities in an interrogation room in Baiyun Airport as the zippers were super glued.

It is believed to be the most ice local customs have ever found leaving the country. 

In another case of drug trafficking abroad, Australian mother Maria Elvira Pinto Exposto, 52, was arrested on December 7 after arriving at Kuala Lumpur International Airport en route from Shanghai to Melbourne.

A routine customs check discovered a hidden compartment in a bag she carried, which contained 1.5 kilogrammes (3.3 pounds) of suspected crystal methamphetamine, or 'ice' 

A routine customs check discovered a hidden compartment in a bag she carried, which contained 1.5 kilogrammes (3.3 pounds) of suspected crystal methamphetamine, or 'ice'. 

Her lawyer has since protested her innocence, claiming Ms Exposto had become involved in an online romance with a person claiming to be a US serviceman. 

She reportedly travelled to Shanghai to meet him, only to discover that another person had been posing as her supposed love interest. 

It was there that she was tricked into carrying the drugs, her lawyer said.
