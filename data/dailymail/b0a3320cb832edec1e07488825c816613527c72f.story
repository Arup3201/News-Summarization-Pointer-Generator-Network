A former New York City police officer has been arrested for allegedly spray-painting anti-Semitic profanities on cars and buildings in a mostly Jewish Brooklyn neighborhood — including the front doors of a religious elementary school.

Michael Setiawan was picked up this morning after police received a 911 call on Saturday night about the swastikas, and other anti-Semitic graffiti in Borough Park.

The 36-year-old faces charges of criminal mischief and aggravated harassment as hate crimes.

Setiawan was a city officer until 2007, serving in Brooklyn's 69th precinct in the Canarsie neighborhood, police said.

Caught in the act: Video captured a man spraying anti-Semitic graffiti on cars and buildings in predominantly Jewish Brooklyn neighborhood on Saturday night. Former NYPD officer Michael Setiawan, 36, has been arrested.

The words 
spray painted in red were found on 15 vehicles and four buildings near 
the Bnos Zion synagogue and school run by the ultra-Orthodox Bobov 
community.

The
 disturbing rants included 'f*** you Jews' and 'Jews ain't s***', 
mostly along Dahill Rd. and 37th St., and 14th Ave. near 38th St.

A surveillance camera at the school captured a bald man with a blue T-shirt spraying a door. The  footage was released by JPUpdates.com.

Police would not immediately confirm is the man was Setiawan.

Setiawan
 and his parents share a home in Queens. His father told The Associated 
Press that he was woken up at 5am this morning by a call from police.

He
 then went to his son's room and roused him. Minutes later, a detective 
showed up to arrest Setiawan, said his father, Thomas Setiawan.

'I
 asked my son, 'What's wrong? What happened? Is anybody hurt?'' the 
Indonesian immigrant said in a telephone interview, his voice rising 
with emotion in heavily accented English. 'He said 'No, don't worry, 
nobody's hurt'.'

But people did get hurt, said state Assemblyman Dov Hikind, who represents the area.

'This
 was not a victimless crime,' Hikind said. 'We have many Holocaust 
survivors here, many elderly people and children who are appropriately 
frightened by unprovoked hate attacks upon their schools and community. 
... Hate attacks on our community will not go unpunished.'

Troubling: Michael Setiawan is accused of spray painting swastikas and racial slurs in red on buildings and cars in Borough Hall, Brooklyn last night

Shocking: Borough Hall's Orthodox Jewish community were outraged when buildings and vehicles in the area were spray painting with anti-Semitic racial slurs and swastikas

City Councilman David Greenfield said the community sprung into action to help police find the vandal.

The
 Borough Park Shomrim, the community’s safety patrol, found the parents 
of a 10-year-old boy who said he saw the suspect leaving and remembered 
the license plate, Greenfield said, according to AM New York.

'It was certainly impressive,' Greenfield said of the quick arrest.

Thomas Setiawan said his son asked him for the keys to the family car around 8pm Saturday, saying he'd left something inside.

'Then we looked out, and the car was gone,' the elder Setiawan said, adding that he and his wife became worried.

He said their son has had mental health issues and that he was depressed and suicidal after leaving the police force. They didn't know why he was no longer an officer, telling them only, 'I want to quit'.

Before joining the force, Michael Setiawan had been laid off from a job at a Long Island cosmetics factory, Thomas Setiawan, 66, said.

Police said Setiawan’s younger brother Erik, a traffic cop, committed suicide in July 2011.

This morning, after he was led away by police, his father said he and his wife were left with Michael Setiawan's young son, who was visiting for the weekend.

The former officer's ex-wife later picked up the child to return to their home in Brooklyn's Bay Ridge, Thomas Setiawan said.

The retired limousine driver said Michael Setiawan was 12 when the family emigrated from Jakarta, Indonesia, in 1989 after winning the green card lottery.

Michael Setiawan was to be arraigned later Sunday or Monday. His father said he did not yet have an attorney.
