Nearly 12,000 criminals have walked free from British courts with suspended sentences despite having at least ten previous convictions, it was revealed today.

A staggering 11,670 repeat offenders had their prison terms suspended last year - with 9,052 of these having 15 or more previous convictions on their record.

The suspended sentences were meted out for a range of offences, including theft, molesting children, taking a bomb into a hotel, benefit fraud, burglary and faking a death.

They were also handed to criminals who had thrown fireworks into a crowd, strangled a cat and had sex with a dog.

The latest figures, dating from May 2012 to June 2013, were released today in a report by the Centre for Crime Prevention think-tank.

Researchers claim they are part of an increasing trend for British judges to suspend the sentences of serious criminals and repeat offenders.

Peter Cuthbertson, the report's author and centre director, said that, altogether, 31 
per cent of jail sentences were suspended last year - compared with just
 two per cent a decade ago.

One judge apparently told researchers that suspended sentences are now handed out in courts 'a bit like confetti'.

It comes as information released by a Freedom of Information request has revealed that 110,745 criminals with previous suspended sentences were convicted for further offences last year.

A shocking 215 of these criminals had ten or more suspended sentences behind them.

Mr Cuthbertson said: 'Thugs and sex offenders who think they are finally going to prison are overjoyed when find out that the prison sentence has been suspended. 

'It makes a mockery of justice for victims and puts the public at great risk. These figures show that criminals given suspended sentences go on to commit hundreds of thousands of crimes. 

He added: 'Suspended sentences should be abolished. Victoria In Australia is currently in the process of abolishing failing suspended sentences.

'In light of similar failings here, England Wales should do the same.'

Despite the think-tank's claims that suspended sentences are not effective, courts in many parts of the country are increasingly using them as a way of dealing with crimes.

Courts in Hertfordshire have seen the biggest rise over the past ten years - with an increase of 82 per cent in the number of suspended sentences handed to criminals.

Just one per cent of sentences in Hertfordshire were suspended by judges in 2002/3, but in 2012/13, the figure was a whopping 36 per cent.

Meanwhile, courts in Bedfordshire saw a 26 per cent increase, those in Cambridgeshire saw a 34 per cent increase and there was a 32 per cent rise in Merseyside.

The areas which saw the highest share of criminals given suspended sentences last year were Northumbria (42 per cent), Cleveland (37 per cent) and Durham (37 per cent).
