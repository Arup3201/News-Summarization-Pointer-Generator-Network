Stroke: Kenneth Kendall died in hospital in Newport on the Isle of Wight where he owned an art gallery

Kenneth Kendall, the first newsreader whose face was seen  on British television screens, died yesterday aged 88.

Kendall, who was known to millions for his elegant style and unflappable manner, had suffered a stroke.

More recently he became familiar to a new generation of viewers as presenter of the game show Treasure Hunt.

It was on September 4, 1955, that he made history by becoming the first BBC newsreader to appear on TV.

Prior to that, presenters’ voices were heard over stills and footage of events because of fears they might, by some facial grimace, display political bias which could dilute the BBC’s  authority and impartiality.

Even after Kendall and his colleagues became visible to viewers, they remained austerely impersonal.

‘In the early days, our names were not even allowed to be mentioned. That was far too showbizzy,’ he once said.

‘We were only professional broadcasters reading stuff written by somebody else. The BBC had auditioned a few actors, but they were turned down because they acted the news – which is exactly what was not wanted.

‘In those early days, some people didn’t understand anything about television.

‘My cousin’s charlady honestly thought I could see her when I was on the screen. One day she said, “I fell asleep watching Mr Kenneth last night and when I woke up my false teeth had fallen out. I feel so ashamed that he saw me without my teeth in”.’

Heyday: Kenneth Kendall presenting the Nine O'Clock News on BBC1 in 1971. He started work at the BBC as a radio announcer before moving on to television in the 1950s where he became well known as a newsreader and a mainstay of the organisation

Born in India, Kendall was educated at
boarding school in England before going on to Oxford and then into the 
Army, where he served in the Coldstream Guards, rising to the rank of 
captain and seeing action in the Normandy landings.

He began working for the BBC in 1948 
as a radio announcer before moving to television in the 1950s. He left 
the BBC in 1961 and spent several years as a freelance, returning in 
1969 and staying until 1981.

He became a household name alongside 
his colleagues  Robert Dougall and Richard Baker, and made a brief cameo
appearance as a broadcaster in Stanley Kubrick’s 1968 film 2001: A 
Space Odyssey. Kendall found fame with a new generation as presenter of 
the Channel 4 game show Treasure Hunt from 1982 to 1989.

The show, which featured Anneka Rice scouring the country for clues in a helicopter, become a huge hit.

He returned to the BBC in 2010 to 
appear in a show called The Young Ones, which featured six celebrities 
examining the problems of ageing.

Last night Tim Davie, acting BBC 
Director-General, said: ‘As one of the broadcasting greats, he will be 
hugely missed by colleagues across the BBC.’ Fran Unsworth, acting 
director of BBC News, said: ‘For generations, Kenneth Kendall’s familiar
face and reassuring voice were instantly recognisable in households 
across the country.’

An enthusiastic sailor, Kendall had 
lived with his long-time partner Mark Fear for many years on the Isle of
Wight, where they ran an art gallery and a charter boat business. He 
died in hospital in Newport. His agent Jeremy Hicks said he had suffered
a stroke in recent weeks and never recovered.
